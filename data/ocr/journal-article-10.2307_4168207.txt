Printed in the United States of America Drunken speech and the construction of meaning: Bilingual competence in the Southern Peruvian Andes1 PENELOPE M. HARVEY Institute of Latin American Studies University of Liverpool ABSTRACT This article examines the language use of drunken speakers in a bilin- gual community of the Southern Peruvian Andes. When drunk, speakers are less constrained in their linguistic choices by considerations of indi- vidual linguistic competence and of differential status between speaker and addressees. Cultural norms of heightened potency and diminished responsibility allow drunken speakers to extend their linguistic reper- toires and to challenge established social relations. Spanish and Quechua carry very complex and ambiguous meanings related to local concep- tions of power and evaluations of an Hispanic and a pre-Hispanic past. Drunks exploit the ambiguities in implicit social meanings that normally function to maintain the status quo as they use their extended com- municative competence to present alternative views on the nature of so- cial relations. (Bilingualism, language and power, social anthropology, South America) Anyone who has spent any time in the peasant communities of the Andes will remember the inebriated ecstasy, the proclamations of friendship, the laugh- ter, the tears, the violence, and the hangovers that result from the frequent and apparently inescapable drinking bouts. Before I went into the field, peo- ple were already giving me tips on how to deal with them. Billie Jean Isbell (I978) devoted much of the first chapter of her widely read ethnography on Andean ecology and ritual to telling how nobody in the community where she worked would speak to her or her colleagues until they had showed that they were prepared to join the drinking sessions and to get drunk. Indeed, in a recent survey of work on alcohol use it was noted that in the Andean literature, "virtually every ethnography has some allusion to drinking and drunkenness" (Heath I987b:25).2 Several anthropologists have stressed the integrative function of drinking in the Andes, and Allen (1988) in particular discussed the way in which alcohol brings people into communication with spiritual beings (see also Har- vey ix9i; Wagner i978). Drinking can constitute an act of sharing and col- ? I99I Cambridge University Press 0047-4045/91 $5.00 + .00 I</page><page sequence="2">PENELOPE M. HARVEY laboration through which the community is created and sustained, through which community identity is created, and through which community proj- ects for progress are realized and continuing care from the supernatural pow- ers is ensured. The refusal to accept a drink can even imply a lack of trust and a denial of mutual respect and affection. However, despite the acknowl- edged cultural salience of drinking, little attention has been paid to the ver- bal aspects of drunken interaction.3 Indeed, the extensive and wide-ranging literature on alcohol use and drinking behavior cross-culturally has paid very little attention to the language use of drinkers.4 A very commonly encountered effect of alcohol is a release from inhibi- tion, accompanied in many cultures by a "time-out" mentality whereby ex- cessive behavior is excused. Verbal behavior is obviously affected in a similar way, and perhaps the most salient feature of drunken speech is the way in which the norms of sober linguistic interaction are flouted. One of the aims of this article is thus to explore the ways in which drunken speakers use lan- guage in this very particular communicative environment, to look at the lim- its of acceptability of drunken behavior and at the extent to which drinkers can take advantage of their altered social position to increase their commu- nicative competence. I refer here particularly to Bourdieu's (1977) concept of practical compe- tence, by which he means the competence not only to speak but also to be heard. Practical competence is the ability to embed utterances in strategies that are tacitly adjusted to the relations of force between speakers. Bourdieu argued that when people lack the symbolic "capital" to endow their speech with authority and thus to be heard, they will tend to remain silent.5 This position also relates to the general principles of politeness in language use de- scribed by Brown and Levinson (1978), who argued that both polite friend- liness and polite formality are strategies employed by speakers to reduce the threat to face (public self-image) that speech acts pose for both speakers and addressees, while still engaging in effective communication. Drunken speakers tend to be far less sensitive to face wants that sober speakers, and their words are thus more likely to lead to insult or embarrassment. Simi- larly, their tendency to speak rather than remain silent implies a reassessment of their symbolic capital and relative authority. The analysis of the language use of drunken speakers is particularly reveal- ing about the role of power and personal authority in linguistic interaction, and it is here that we move from the general theme of drunken speech to its particular Andean manifestation.6 This article thus aims to describe a dis- tinctive Andean discourse, a particular set of possible meanings, embedded in specific historical experiences. It is with reference to these principles that I explain the way in which Andean drinkers extend their linguistic repertoires, looking particularly at the increased use of Spanish by Quechua speakers dur- ing the drinking sessions. 2</page><page sequence="3">BILINGUAL COMPETENCE IN THE SOUTHERN PERUVIAN ANDES After a brief description of Ocongate, a small Andean town in the Depart- ment of Cusco, I first discuss local conceptions of power and authority and the relationship of these to representations of the past. Second, I briefly out- line an ethnography of drinking practice in this community. These two ini- tial sections are intended to provide information on the general parameters of possible meanings or shared experience. The third section comprises close textual analysis of drunken speech as illustration of three principal features of the language of drunks: (a) joking, (b) expressions of pride and despair, and (c) confrontation.7 BACKGROUND AND METHODOLOGY Fieldwork was carried out in the town of Ocongate, a District capital in the Province of Quispicanchis, Department of Cusco, Southern Peru.8 The vil- lage has a population of about 1300, more than 85 percent of whom are in- volved in agriculture and animal raising. However, few live solely off the land and there is considerable business activity in the village. They buy and sell products from the smaller outlying communities of the district and also goods brought from the cities. Ocongate is situated on a main road that links the Departmental capital of Cusco with the lowland Department of Madre de Dios. As a result, there is a constant traffic of goods and migrant work- ers through the village. In accordance with what writers such as Cerron-Palomino (I982), Esco- bar (1972), Mannheim (I985), and Zuiiiiga (I974) would lead us to expect for this area, bilingualism is relatively stable. Increased access to education has meant that many more people learn Spanish, but there is no correlating de- crease in the number of Quechua speakers. In Ocongate, 88 percent of the men and 51 percent of the women are bilingual; 34 percent of the women are monolingual in Quechua, but only 3 percent of the men. I here classify as bilingual those speakers who can express themselves with equal ease and fluency (although not necessarily with equal frequency) in both Quechua and Spanish and who are recognized by others in the commu- nity as fully competent in both languages. Also classified as bilingual are those who - despite showing a marked preference for Quechua and whose Spanish is strongly marked by Quechua influences - nevertheless can and do use both languages as the situation demands. I distinguish these two groups in this article by referring to high-frequency Spanish speakers and high-fre- quency Quechua speakers. Those not represented in the percentages given are Quechua speakers who can only use very limited Spanish in specific situa- tions. Such speakers will usually have a basic passive knowledge of Spanish. Spanish monolinguals have not been considered here as they comprise very few individuals, specifically some police officers and schoolteachers, who have a distinctive outsider status in the community. 3</page><page sequence="4">PENELOPE M. HARVEY Much of the data I collected were entirely unsolicited: stories told spon- taneously, conversations carried out in my presence, comments overheard. I conducted some formal interviews in which answers to particular questions were tape-recorded with the informants' knowledge. On other occasions, I tape-recorded without the informants' prior knowledge, sometimes openly, sometimes with the recorder hidden. Clandestine taping is, of course, ex- tremely problematic methodologically, and a practice justifiably criticized by those concerned with the exploitation of the researched by the more power- ful researcher. In this case, the tape recorder was not hidden in order to ob- tain natural data. My presence was always part of the interaction, although conversations where the tape recorder was not obviously present did not fo- cus on me in the same way. My concern was not that particular linguistic fea- tures would be consciously monitored by informants were they to become conscious of the tape recorder, but rather that the discussion of particular topics and particular kinds of interaction might not occur at all if they were thus formally placed on-the-record. Obviously, the fact that I controlled whether statements were on- or off- the-record in this way, through my possession of the technology and my access to a readership to whom I could publish what I found out, empha- sizes the unequal relationship between me and the people of Ocongate. That such a power relationship should exist is itself problematic for anthropology and a topic for much discussion and reexamination within the profession.9 Once an anthropologist begins to write, the casual conversations, comments, and practices of everyday life are put on-the-record, whatever the method by which they were recorded. In this sense, the problem basically lies in the re- lationship between representation and authorship in anthropology as a whole rather than in the specific form of data collection. Furthermore, the relation- ship to "power" of both researcher and researched is extremely complex and one that in itself requires extensive investigation.'0 I have, of course, re- tained the anonymity of the participants to all the interactions described herein. POWER AND AUTHORITY The people of Ocongate conceive of two sources of power, both external to the community and ultimately beyond the control of community mem- bers. These are (a) the power of the state and (b) the power of the animate landscape. The power of the state The Spanish-speaking state is seen as a force for both positive and negative intervention in the locality. Positive interventions include the building and maintenance of schools where people learn to read and write in Spanish; in- 4</page><page sequence="5">BILINGUAL COMPETENCE IN THE SOUTHERN PERUVIAN ANDES stitutions that provide services such as drinking water or the hope of services such as electricity; the market economy and the possibility of cash incomes to buy 'comforts' (comodidades) such as two-story houses, tile roofs, kitchen utensils, clothes, blankets, radios, tape recorders, even trucks. However, peo- ple also perceive of the state as a source of danger, a capricious and nega- tive force that affects the community adversely. They are conscious of their marginalization from the potential benefits of the rich Spanish-speaking world; they remember the unfulfilled promises of electioneers and, further back in time, the abuses of the landowners of the large estates and subse- quently of the state employees who administered the new Cooperatives af- ter the Agrarian Reform of I969. Many people directly experienced the power of the army and of the police during violent land disputes associated with a local estate (hacienda)." They know that the education that they re- ceive is not very good and that the money they earn does not provide for their needs. Their attitude toward the state is therefore ambiguous - the state is both a source of progress and a source of oppression. In both its positive and neg- ative manifestations, the people of Ocongate feel that they ultimately have no control over its actions. Its power is necessary but dangerous. The power of the animate landscape Here, I refer particularly to supernatural beings such as the Pachamama and the Awkis. Pachamama, often translated as Mother Earth, is a general force or power rather than a personified deity. This power is associated with the fertility of the soil and the fecundity of animals and yet is also seen as the cause of illness, sterility, and even death. The force can be concentrated in specific places that thus become extremely dangerous to human beings (see, e.g., Gose I986; Harris I980; Harvey I987a; Mariscotti 1978; Sallnow I987). The Awkis are the more specific anthropomorphic mountain spirits associ- ated with particular named places, and, similarly to Pachamama, their power is associated with a wild source of both fertility and misfortune.'2 These autochthonous powers thus control the fertility of the land, the fe- cundity of animals, health, and good fortune, yet as with the state they also have their negative and capricious side. People have to attend to them with great care and attention, as their goodwill is vital for the reproduction of the community in the locality. On the basis of their experience of these two sources of power, the peo- ple of Ocongate have constructed two distinct representations of the past, which are of vital importance. They stand as reference points for the con- struction of identity, for the construction of hierarchy and as a source of meaning for symbolic activity. On the one hand, people establish continuity with their autochthonous past. They name the Awki hill spirits as kin, calling them grandparents, and 5</page><page sequence="6">PENELOPE M. HARVEY they emphasize similarities in both lifestyle and bodily substance between themselves and these beings. The Awkis are presented as Quechua speakers. In these terms, people become connected by ties of descent to the locality, a locality that provides them with food, mineral deposits, and a store of wealth in their animals. People also talk of themselves as descendants of the Inkas and in the oral tradition that refers to this past, the Awkis and the Inkas occupy a similar structural position in opposition to the Spaniards. It is in these terms that people take pride in their indigenous identity and find security in the access it affords them to the source of all fertility and pro- ductivity in the area. This positive identity is constructed in opposition to Spanish-speaking outsiders, people who operate outside the morality of kin- ship, people who come only to exploit and to rob them of their material wealth. If such outsiders hold power, it is a power that is irrelevant to the successful reproduction of the community in the locality. If the Spaniards conquered the indigenous people, their defeat was neither definitive nor ac- cepted (see Earls 1973; Harvey I987a). On the other hand, the inhabitants of Ocongate also present themselves as a people who have moved out of the savage state in which the Spaniards found them at the Conquest. They have become "civilized" and have assim- ilated to the identity of the conqueror; they value education and know how to operate in the modern world. Conquest in this view of the past marks a distinct break with the inverted and immoral world of their ancestors, a time of darkness and ignorance. The Awkis are presented as primitive, both in stature and lifestyle. Their ignorance is despised. The Awkis did not know the sun but lived and worked by the light of the moon, furthermore the Inkas were illiterate.13 People recognize that the structure of society is such that the benefits of this "civilization" (such as education and material comforts) may be inacces- sible; that poverty, for example, has prevented and continues to prevent them from enjoying its benefits to the fullest. Nevertheless, the benefits are seen as important and relevant to their lives, and people will work to achieve them for their children even if they do not hope to get them for themselves. The model is thus inverted and the implication of this past is that the people of Ocongate are now the conquerors and if the conquered continue to hold a certain power, it is a power that is ultimately irrelevant to the modern world. The people of Ocongate are thus aware of two distinct pasts. One, asso- ciated with the Quechua language, combines a positive evaluation of their powerful autochthonous ancestors with a negative view of the Spanish invad- ers. The other, associated with Spanish, presents the Spanish-speaking state as a positive civilizing force acting on the ignorant backwardness of the su- perstitious indigenous people. I have stressed that both the power of the state and the power of the land- scape are seen as being located outside the community, and both kinds of 6</page><page sequence="7">BILINGUAL COMPETENCE IN THE SOUTHERN PERUVIAN ANDES power are ultimately inaccessible and in some senses undesirable. Authority within the community is necessarily of a different order. This is unstable power exercised by known individuals. Such authority is achieved by indi- vidual effort and is ultimately dependent on the extent to which any given individual can invoke the positive dimension of external power without as- sociating themselves with its negative aspects. AN ETHNOGRAPHY OF DRINKING Drinking is of paramount importance to the ritual life of Andean people, and from about the age of i6, both men and women are expected to drink in ag- ricultural, domestic, Catholic, and state festivals. Corn beer (aha (Q)/chicha (Sp)), watered-down industrial alcohol (trago), and commercial beer are the most commonly consumed drinks. Corn beer has important ritual signifi- cance and is always consumed as an integral part of ritual activity. However, in this area it has a very low alcohol content.'4 Commercial beers are expen- sive and trago is thus the most widely consumed alcoholic drink. Everyone is served from the same little glass in turn and the autochthonous powers of the locality are also drawn into the drinking circles. Libations are made to the earth and drink is flicked into the air for the Awkis. Although each individual drinks in succession, the drinking is a communal process. The recipient may draw in other individuals and should not drink without saluting the company. The words " Tomasunchis" (you and I will drink together) and tomanki (you drink) stress the communal aspect of the drinking. Tomanki implies "I am drinking for you; you drink when I drink." It states an identification between the drinker and the audience; thus, while only one person drinks at a time, everyone drinks all the time in spirit. (Wagner 1978:175) Drinking sessions fall into two basic stages. There is no striking moment when they move from one to the other but there is a qualitative change in the purpose of drinking and in the rhythm of consumption. Initially, peo- ple drink to liven up (para animarse (Sp)/kausachikunanpaq (Q)). Drink- ing to "liven up" involves the idea of building yourself up, encouraging yourself to do something outside of the normal, whether this be to work par- ticularly hard, to sing, to dance, to show your affection, to talk, tell stories, and reminisce. To work, sing, or dance with enthusiasm encourages others to do likewise and also, most importantly, allows the individual to fulfill the purpose for which the drink is being provided. Once such a task has been ful- filled all drink to get drunk (para emborracharse (Sp)/machananpaq (Q)). Such drinking is done in celebration of the fulfillment of a social duty. Peo- 7</page><page sequence="8">PENELOPE M. HARVEY ple are expected to drink until they lose consciousness or are dragged away by a caring child or spouse. Drunks are not responsible for what they do and say. This effective im- munity from responsibility is codified grammatically in Quechua where there is a verbal suffix (-SQA) used to report actions in which the speaker did not fully participate, that is, when drunk, when dreaming, when very young, or when not participating personally."5 People themselves forget what happens when they drink and also distance themselves from the event by saying that it is the trago that speaks and not the person drinking. Drinking is not always seen as the socially acceptable, indeed even neces- sary, action that I have described. It can also be construed as antisocial be- havior. People whose drinking is deemed to be antisocial are those who drink por vicio (literally, 'from bad habit'). People are most commonly accused of drinking por vicio in the following circumstances: (a) when not drinking with the appropriate rhythm and failing to distinguish between drinking in mod- eration, in order to fulfill a social duty (drinking to liven up), and drinking less moderately, in celebration of its fulfillment (drinking to get drunk); (b) when drinking without a motive (por gusto/yanqa). Drinking practices also reveal that the fulfillment and celebration of so- cial duties in the community can often work against the interests of individual households. An individual can experience conflicting demands from commu- nity and household. Such tensions most usually emerge in connection with the participation or nonparticipation of women in drinking sessions, the ex- pense of these sessions, and the desire to protect household members from the dangers, both natural and supernatural, that drinkers are subject to.16 It should be noted that not only does drinking cause problems for the household's social reproduction, as opposed to the community's, but it is also antithetical to sexual reproduction. Deformed children are believed to be the result of a man having sexual relations with his partner while drunk. I would add that despite drinking being antithetical to the needs of the household and women complaining a lot about their husband's drinking (their interpretation of the man's community-oriented duties is that the men are viciosos and irresponsible), it is appreciated by both men and women that drinking is a necessary way of ensuring interhousehold cooperation for cer- tain agricultural tasks and life-cycle rituals. This tension is further exacer- bated as these community-oriented cargos have been somewhat displaced, as ways of gaining prestige in the community, and individual accumulation of education and money becomes far more important.17 Despite the fact that drinking is one of the basic social acts of the village, it inevitably generates tensions even at the level of community. Drinking groups imply a degree of inclusion and exclusion, and it is striking that vil- lagers never drink as a single community except at funerals and at the related festival of All Saints and All Souls. On these occasions, the living form a 8</page><page sequence="9">BILINGUAL COMPETENCE IN THE SOUTHERN PERUVIAN ANDES community in opposition to the dead. Everyone is both welcome and ex- pected on these occasions and, whereas it is never the case that everyone at- tends, this stated ideal contrasts these occasions with all others."8 The drinking behaviors that I have described are familiar both in Western cultural experience and in the literature on other non-Western societies. For example, Price (I975), in an analysis of North American Indian drinking pat- terns from the Arctic to New Mexico, referred to social integration, increased social animation, time-out, release from inhibitions, transcendence of the physical to obtain spiritual experience, joking, quarreling, depression, and heightened sexuality. These behaviors occur in different combinations and with different emphases in the whole range of societies described in the wider literature. However, this same literature also establishes the importance of recognizing cross-cultural variation, both in drinking patterns and in attitudes shown toward alcohol and drunken behavior, and emphasizes quite rightly the need to get away from explanations of drunken behavior that reduce ex- tremely complex social practices either to individual pathology or to collec- tive escapism.'9 With the aim of demonstrating some of this complexity, I now go on to discuss three principal features of the language of drunks: (a) joking, (b) ex- pressions of pride and despair, (c) confrontation. JOKING Text one was recorded during the performance of a mock marriage and bap- tism ceremony enacted during the Festival of All Saints and All Souls (this and all texts discussed are given in the Appendix, with their translation). These performances take place after the major ritual activities of November 1st (the Day of the Living) and November 2nd (the Day of the Dead) and are organized by young married people in the village who say that it gives them a good excuse to enjoy themselves drinking and dancing. The main characters are the priest and the sacristan. For these roles, the organizers try to find slightly older people with sufficient confidence to make good jokes in public - all the better if they are slightly drunk as they are likely to be funnier. In this example, the priest was a 35-year-old man who worked in agriculture and in gold panning. The sacristan was an older man, about 6o, who also worked in agriculture and occasionally as a building laborer in Cusco. They were both quite drunk. The organizers also choose a bride and groom and four godparents from among the young people who come to watch. The rest of the spectators play the part of those invited to the ceremony. The bride and groom sit at a table, normally set up outside in a suitably large yard. The priest and sacristan dress up for their parts. When enough people have gathered, the ceremony begins with the baptism of bread-babies, 9</page><page sequence="10">PENELOPE M. HARVEY which are made in the village before the Day of the Living and which girls dress up and carry around on their backs as if they were real babies. If a girl brings her bread-baby to be baptized, the priest and sacristan ask for its name and its parents' names. The name giving is the subject of much joking. It is the names themselves that are the main source of humor, particularly that of the absent father. Sometimes they say he is an Inka, or they invent an Inka-sounding name, such as Lloqllopanki. Alternatively, he might be an Awki, an old man from Kupi (a nearby pre-Hispanic ruin generally believed to have been an Awki village). On one occasion, a woman declared that the baby was the son of a drunk from Kupi. Once the names have been established, the godmother holds the baby while the priest sprinkles water on its head and makes the sign of the cross. At this stage, the priest and sacristan commonly announce that the baby has died - making play of the fact that it is neither breathing nor moving - and proceed to perform an autopsy on it. The baby is broken up to investigate its insides and the bread is distributed among those present. On the occasion when Text 1 was recorded, no baptisms were carried out as word had gone round that they were going to perform autopsies and the girls did not want to lose their bread. However, there are references to the baptisms in the text. At the beginning of this recorded extract, the priest is calling for all the pockmarked children (phrase 2), insinuating that there are several of them. When nobody comes forward, he refers to women having three husbands (phrase i i), a comment that the sacristan picks up and elaborates (phrases 12-13), suggesting prolific sexual activity that would logically produce nu- merous offspring. The sacristan then reminds people that the doctor (the priest) has come all the way from Spain for this "ceremony" and that it was a difficult journey as he has three testicles and they were weighing him down (phrases 15-20). Allusions to the sexual activity and potency of the priest are made here. The humor revolves around the explicit articulation of what most people hold to be true, namely that Catholic priests (despite their vows of chastity) lead active sex lives. These jokes also refer to the ambiguous rela- tionship between sterility and fertility. People lead active sex lives but do not produce children; the priest is very potent with his three testicles, but at the same time they burden him and make movement difficult.20 When the baptisms are over or it is obvious that there are not going to be any, the sacristan calls for those people who want to get married (phrases 35-36). He makes reference to unsuitable marriage partners, such as old men and women, Awkis, children, and even stones and spectacles (phrases 30-4I). He and the priest go back to talking about whether there are any ba- bies to baptize and the jokes center on their suggestion that particular men in the audience (who were pushing forward for a better look) were claiming to have given birth (phrases 48-54). The text ends as they begin the "mar- riage" ceremony. 10</page><page sequence="11">BILINGUAL COMPETENCE IN THE SOUTHERN PERUVIAN ANDES The chosen couple is then asked why they want to get married and if they have come together out of their own free will. The exact form of the service varies on each occasion, as the actors make jokes within the framework of the wedding ceremony. The Peruvian civil wedding ceremony involves the reading aloud of a series of articles from the civil code that specify the rights and obligations of each of the partners. In Text 2 the priest and sacristan act together to make a play on the word arti'culo (article). A more common form of the joking at this stage is that the content of the articles is changed and bad advice is given to the couple. For example, the women might be told that when her husband asks for water she must make him toasted maize, and when he is hungry give him water. The audience knows that the priest and sacristan will inevitably fall in love with the bride and can thus infer double meanings from apparently innocent statements. On this occasion, the apparently innocent versicle response set out in Text 3 is seen as being extremely funny. At this stage of a religious ceremony, phrase one would usually be taken to mean "May the Lord be with you too." However, the sacristan uses the fact that the utterance is nonspecific to suggest an alternative meaning. Fa- cial expressions and gestures make it clear that he is referring to the bride. The possibility for this interpretation is strengthened when the husband is subsequently advised by the sacristan in quite explicit terms that he ought not return to his job in the forest because the priest is planning to run off with his new wife. By introducing this interpretation, the sacristan both declares his own sexual intentions and subverts the meaning of the priest's neutral expression. Analysis of the jokes Two principal themes emerge from an analysis of the drunken joking just de- scribed: (a) the verbalization of a central preoccupation with ambiguity and paradox and (b) the flouting of social norms of respect. Ambiguity/paradox. The apparently paradoxical relationship between sterility and fertility expressed in Text one is representative of a general con- cern with the ambiguous nature of autochthonous power. On those occasions when ritual is directed toward the regeneration of fertility in the locality, such concern is often expressed in drunken joking that focuses on incongruities of gender; for example, the suggestion that men could be women is a fre- quent source of humor. I have recorded several drunken conversations in which men have claimed to be menstruating or to be pregnant. The gender issues involved here are obviously complex but it appears that male ritual actors become "women" in an attempt to harness natural fertility. Their ver- bal expression of this desire is complemented by the more formalized prac- 11</page><page sequence="12">PENELOPE M. HARVEY tice of men dressing as women in many ritual dramas and dances (Allen I983; Poole, n.d.). The "female" in the Andes has long been associated with the indigenous on a conceptual level (Silverblatt I987; Zuidema 1964). The indigenous female is thus a very strong symbol of ambiguity; the power of fertility coexists with the powerlessness of a defeated or dominated people, the authenticity of tradition with notions of backwardness, ignorance, and degeneracy. Another important and connected paradox is that of the interdependence of the forces of life and death. There is great emphasis placed on the sexual potency of drunk men, and the expression of sexual desire is one of the most common topics of drunken conversation. The very concept of animarse em- phasizes the fact that drinking is about increasing productive potency. It is about livening up; overcoming shyness, lack of confidence, and shame in or- der to be able to have fun, laugh, make jokes, create a sense of community, and fulfill the ritual task at hand with vigor and enthusiasm. Drinking is di- rected at increasing the strength of the participants, to affect the fertility of their fields, to strengthen kin and spiritual kinship bonds and ideally those with the wider community as well. Drinking is about putting life into the activity in question, harnessing energy and enthusiasm, and bolstering con- fidence by banishing fear. Thus animated and strengthened, the power of the spirit world is also invoked to further the task at hand. The drinking is there- fore directly linked both to the reproduction of the community and to the crops that sustain the community. However, this reproductive power, once achieved, is essentially unrestrained. To fully engage with this power drink- ers must move from a controlled state of animation to the more emotionally charged and uncontrolled experience of drunkenness. It is in this second stage of drunkenness that the principles of life and death are juxtaposed and the paradox of their interdependence is revealed. Drunks are believed to engender deformed babies and in this sense the potent drinker is ultimately portrayed as sterile. An important and interesting parallel arises here as it is also be- lieved that sexual relations with an Awki, the source of fertility, lead to the birth of deformed babies who will not survive the first months of life. The parallels between drunks, the dead, and the Awkis (who are presented ambiguously in the oral tradition as both living and dead) are too numerous to be passed over. The connection is sometimes made very directly. A drinker in the cemetery once told me that "the dead are drunks." During the mock baptisms that are performed as part of the festival for the dead, girls fre- quently claim to have babies by old men, Awkis, and Inkas who are thus par- adoxically presented as sources of fertility. Similar references are made in Text one (phrases 30-35) by the priest, the sacristan, and a male onlooker. The paradox is emphasized when the bread-babies, the new life, are in turn found to be dead. The autopsy enhances the paradox. The "dead" bread- babies are broken up and distributed to the audience by the priest in an overt 12</page><page sequence="13">BILINGUAL COMPETENCE IN THE SOUTHERN PERUVIAN ANDES reference to the spiritual sustenance of the communion service and the di- rect and literal material sustenance provided through the distribution of food. Drunks, the Awkis, and the dead are also linked in their unreliability and disruptiveness; their strong potential for good is always qualified by the trou- ble they cause. In some senses, they could be seen as operating in the same social space. It is usually drunks who see Awkis. Alcohol as mind-altering substance gives the user an experience of a spiritual realm separate from the world of normal experience but linked to it as the origin of causality and creative energy. Unlike the hallucino- gens used in the tropical forest, however, coca and alcohol do not trans- port the user to this other realm; instead they act as conduits through which the influence of one realm of existence passes on to another. Con- sumed to excess, they make the consumers themselves into such conduits. (Wagner 1978:258) Drinking is an integral part of the ritual life of the community and drunks are thus indispensable for the creation and maintenance of the community just as the Awkis and the dead are for continuing fertility.2' I would further suggest that this connection is recognized in the respect that is shown to drunks in the latter stages of ritual drinking sessions. Ambiguity and paradox are not confined to the conceptual level but are also expressed through extensive word play, as illustrated in Texts I and 2. In Text 2, the word art(culo is split into two morphs, one spoken by the priest and the other by the sacristan. The splitting of the word between the two speakers allows the sacristan to change the stress from the ['to the u and pronounce the word culo, meaning anus. In phrase 7 of Text i, the sacristan again uses the word anus through a deliberate mispronunciation of the word cura 'priest' as cula 'anus'. The deliberate mispronunciation can be deduced from the dramatic way he pro- nounces the word, with a raised voice, using stress and pausing slightly be- fore he utters it, for maximum effect. In phrases 22-23 of Text i, there is a complicated wordplay on the words vuelo 'flight' and huevo 'testicle/egg' that exploits both connotative and pho- netic similarities ([wuelo] [wuevo]). Finally, the example in Text i, phrases I6-I9: the sacristan asks the priest if he comes from Spain, "Hispafiamanta (sic) hamusqanki." When the priest replies that he does, the sacristan picks on the phonetic similarity between his pronunciation of Espania 'Spain' as Hispafia and the Quechua verb Hisp'ay 'to urinate'. The sacristan then acts as if aware of the possibility of a con- fusion between the two words and checks that the priest did not mean to say that he had urinated. It can be noticed that all these jokes depend on the use of Spanish, despite the fact that Text one is predominantly a Quechua text. The use of Quechua 13</page><page sequence="14">PENELOPE M. HARVEY here is to be expected given its association with the autochthonous powers of the locality. Quechua represents both the locality and the power of fer- tility, and its use as the principal language of ritual and the preferred lan- guage of sexual joking both reflects and reinforces this representation. The use of Spanish establishes Text one as an example of bilingual rather than Quechua discourse. In making these puns, the actors assert their bilingual- ism, as do the audience in their appreciation of the jokes. The essential bilin- gualism of the text raises an interesting possibility concerning the purpose of this assertion - that the bilingualism in some sense posits a resolution of the conceptual ambiguities raised at other levels. In the section on power and authority, I suggested that the people of Ocon- gate are aware of two distinct pasts that necessarily co-exist. Neither one is either acceptable or available in isolation. In those ritual contexts in which people are explicitly seeking to harness the power of the animate landscape, they need to find a way to neutralize the danger of the wild autochthonous powers and to counteract the negative implication of their evocation of this line of descent. Drunks express these concerns in their joking and also attempt to resolve them by the use of a bilingual discourse that symbolically neutral- izes the implications of either a Quechua or Spanish option in isolation. Flouting of norms of respect. In everyday sober interaction, norms of respect operate to maintain harmonious hierarchical social relations. Drunken speech is marked by its lack of respect, and joking is an area where being out- side respect can be socially acceptable. The weddings and baptisms at Todos Santos provide a particularly good example. During this ritual, the actors and audience (by their collaborative laughter) display a lack of respect for insti- tutions of the Catholic Church by making fun not only of the priests, but also of the order of service and the kind of language used. Lexical taboos are deliberately violated in Texts i and 2 in the use of such words as testi- cle, anus, fuck, and urine as part of a religious ceremony. However, the flouting of norms of respect carries its own risks. The prob- lem arises with the thin line that the joker treads between a successful joke and an insult, resulting from the violation of respect. Much Quechua humor involves the use of creative and thus amusing insults.22 Within the confines of a ritual drama, the joker is unlikely to cause insult as it is the ritual char- acter rather than the individual who is the joker/insulter. Personal insult therefore should manifestly not be inferred. The measure of a successful joke/insult is whether or not the assembled company finds it funny. If it raises laughter, the addressee cannot take offense and the only appropriate response is to reply with an even funnier joke/insult. However, outside of this very close link between the joking and the spe- cific ritual character, the line between joking and insult becomes a more dif- ficult one to tread. People are very conscious of the fact that drinking leads 14</page><page sequence="15">BILINGUAL COMPETENCE IN THE SOUTHERN PERUVIAN ANDES to a discourse that lies outside respect and therefore deliberately avoid drink- ing in relationships that should never be formulated in this way. This is es- pecially true of the godparent/godchild relationship and to some extent the parent/child and older brother/younger siblings relationship. It is important that the inferior party in the relationship should not be drunk in the pres- ence of the superior party. The relationships that are deemed unsuitable for ever being formulated outside of hierarchy are those based primarily on moral values rather than on differences in political and economic power. In these former cases, it is not in the interest of the person who commands authority to risk an affront to the respect which, under sober circumstances, sustains the imbalance in the relationship. EXPRESSIONS OF PRIDE AND DESPAIR As people begin to get slightly drunk, they lose their shyness and begin to tell jokes, to talk and laugh together. Communication between people thus increases in the first stage of animated talk. As people get more drunk, they begin to express both despair and defiance in a waxing and waning of con- fidence typical of the drunk who struggles to situate the force of the energy gained through drinking. Such expression normally takes the form of a monologue. Texts 4 and 5 were recorded before and after the bullfight held to celebrate national Independence Day (Fiestas Patrias). The occasion is the waqa kachapariy (farewell to the cattle when men are sent out from the village to join up with the riders who have been herding the bulls down from the high puna, the grassy steppes that form the high- est ecological zone of the Andes). The men hired to go on this occasion had been drinking to 'liven themselves up' (animarse) for the journey. They were drunk and delaying proceedings. The Mayor is present in his official capac- ity, the Independence Day bullfight being partially sponsored by the Town Hall. The Governor, on the other hand, has no official duties on this occa- sion.23 However, he does evoke his office through reference to a future bull- fight that he is responsible for organizing in the month of August. The Governor is asserting that if the hired men do not set off immediately, he will go on his own. He says that he has done as much before, thereby val- idating his boast and reminding people that this is not the first time that he has had political and ritual responsibilities. He also thus reminds people that he has knowledge of tradition and the ability to fulfill the customs of the lo- cality. He is a high-frequency Spanish speaker, educated and formerly of high status in the village, having previously been Governor, Mayor, and the holder of ritual responsibilities. He is also an alcoholic. Despite this, he is a very forceful speaker with impressive powers of persuasion. People listen 15</page><page sequence="16">PENELOPE M. HARVEY to him both because of this command of Spanish and, in some cases, because of his political authority. The Mayor and the trader are sober, the rest are drunk. The Governor is also the speaker in Text 5. This text was recorded dur- ing the condor kacharpariy 'farewell to the condor' after the bullfight. The condor is caught for the bullfight and released, drunk, into the village square to face the bull along with the other bullfighters. The bird is not tied to the bull as in some areas of Southern Peru and is released unharmed on the following day. People drink a lot on this occasion in celebration of the suc- cessful completion of the festival and to animate people to elect new cargo holders for the coming year - or preferably to encourage volunteers for these ritual responsibilities. The drinking session also gives people the chance to publicly air any grievances they may have about the running of the festival. On this occasion, one of the riders who had brought the bulls in from the puna made a public complaint about the fact that the corrals on the route had not been available for use. The assembled company had listened to him quietly and the Governor was given leave by the Mayor to reply. After briefly addressing the complaint, he again launched into a speech about how he was going to run the bullfight in August. The Governor's preoccupation remained the same as in Text 4: to assert that he is capable of running the bullfight in the traditional manner with no collaboration from anyone else. He has done it before and will do it again even if he alone fetches the bulls, brings them in, and fights them single-handed. Such an assertion of autonomy amounts to a forceful claim to personal power in the district, as he implies thereby that he has sufficient godchildren and political subordinates in the outlying areas to help him organize and run the event. To assert that he needs no collaboration suggests that he needs no formal help from the village. The speech is, of course, highly rhetorical and the use of such formal political discourse is in itself an achievement on the part of the Governor, who has to not only success- fully employ this form of speech but also impose it on his none too sober audience. The Governor employs various linguistic strategies to achieve this end. He avoids or ignores interruptions by speaking very fast. In phrase 13 of Text 4 he simple talks over the trader who is trying to calm him down. He contin- ually repeats himself in order to make his most important point, which, as the marked emphasis indicates, is that he is going alone. In Text 5, he holds the floor with the help of various aggressive linguistic strategies. The whole speech is delivered in a very loud voice and the rhythm is such that each phrase holds its own emphasis. At the beginning of the speech, he uses short stressed phrases with a sustained tone. He thus point- edly does not invite others to speak. He makes no allowance for dialogue, nor is he looking for responses. 16</page><page sequence="17">BILINGUAL COMPETENCE IN THE SOUTHERN PERUVIAN ANDES In both Texts 4 and 5, Spanish, and the implicit reference to the positive history it can denote, is combined with an assertion of a right to authority in the locality, through an appeal to knowledge of tradition and the hold- ing of political and religious office. In terms of local hierarchy, the Governor is asserting his independence and superiority to the others present. He also publicly addresses the problematic and uneasy social arrangements that underlie the occasion as he overtly tries to make individual political capital out of what should be a communal and collaborative event. The contradiction that is made explicit here centers on the nature of community festivals. They are ideally supposed to be events in which all members of the community come together in celebration and in col- laboration with each other. However, in practice it is the cargo holder who has to shoulder the responsibility when the festival does not match the desires of the community. The behavior of the drunk in Text 4 is also interesting. He felt the intended slight in the Governor's words and was furious. He spoke so fast and in such an outrage that his words became unintelligible. His intervention is interest- ing in several ways, first, in that he challenges the Governor at all. There is a wide status difference between them and in such cases the lower status in- dividual would usually remain silent, as indeed the trader encourages him to do. Second, he challenges the Governor in Spanish, despite the fact that oth- ers present are using Quechua. The man knows very little Spanish and it is thus difficult for him to get started in his challenge to the Governor, but his strategy is to reply in the language that the Governor has appropriated as the language of authority for that moment. He does this despite not speaking Spanish well. In the event his words become unintelligible, to the extent that another man present ignores the fact that he is speaking and talks over him' 4 In both these examples, the linguistic strategy of self-assertion is to use a determined and aggressive monologue, speaking loud and fast with marked emphasis and much repetition. Interruption is disallowed by using a sustained tone and, when that fails, talking over people. The claims and assertions of pride and self-worth illustrated here center on the right to authority in the locality. It is important to note that the style in which these assertions are made is used by drunks from all sectors of society regardless of their prac- tical competence in Spanish. Thus, for example, people would often shout yo sabo todo (for yo se todo) 'I know everything'. People who knew very little Spanish would nevertheless express pride in their indigenous identity in Spanish rather than Quechua, using phrases such as soy indio de la puna - pura inkaica 'I am an Indian from the puna - a true Inka'. High-frequency Spanish speakers also express pride in their Quechua language and stress their attachment to the locality 17</page><page sequence="18">PENELOPE M. HARVEY using phrases such as somos todos hijos del Ausangate 'we are all children of Ausangate', the most powerful Awki in the area. I move now to another major area of preoccupation among drunks: re- flection on how hard life is and how much one has to suffer. I briefly out- line some of the principal causes of despair. People cry about being alone. It is something that women feel most acutely because in Ocongate more women than men marry into the community, and they feel the lack of support that only close kin can provide. Men and women cry as they reflect on their poverty and the ways in which they suffer as a result. They think about the low productivity of their fields and of animals that have been stolen or killed in accidents. On receiving ritual responsibilities, people would often cry, proclaiming that they were very poor and would suffer a great deal in order to bring off the festival. This was true even of people with relatively good incomes. This discourse of despair therefore centers on the explicit realization of the limits of kinship - especially the vulnerable position of the in-marrying spouse - and of the fact of poverty despite continual hard work. I have emphasized how this language of despair is marked by crying. The lack of swearing and defiant attitudes are other markers. In this section, I have discussed a discourse that focuses on both self- validation and a concern with suffering and despair at how hard life is. What I find interesting is the juxtaposition of these two topics in drunken speech. In any drinking session, people are likely to move between these forms of speech, but it is most striking when an individual swings violently from one to the other and back again. I was often struck by how drunks would laugh loudly proclaiming some positive statement about themselves and then swing into crying and talking despairingly about themselves, and then again back to laughter and pride. These swings could continue for an hour or so, peo- ple continually repeating the same phrases. The swings usually only emerge at a late stage of drunkenness when people are no longer concerned with any kind of linear communication and instead repeat their preoccupation of that moment. These examples illustrate a very distinctive feature of drunken speech: the directness with which people confront the issues that lie at the heart of their ambiguous social position. They assert that their power or authority lies in the assumption of a positive Indian identity while simultaneously acknowl- edging that the moral values of kinship and hard work leave them in a de- graded state of poverty. They vividly experience the impossibility of fully embracing their autochthonous past. The swings from pride to grief emphasize the strong sense of insecurity in their social position, especially as the people most prone to this discourse are those in the most ambiguous position socially. This can be seen most vividly during festivals when their "Indianness," which usually constitutes their lack 18</page><page sequence="19">BILINGUAL COMPETENCE IN THE SOUTHERN PERUVIAN ANDES of status, is suddenly proclaimed to be the source of their authority. This authority in the ritual context sits uneasily with their paramount lack of power in the economic and political sphere and with their feelings of solitude, poverty, and suffering. However, this awareness of basic contradictions in their lives does not lead to analysis of their situation, nor does it provide them with a means of answering the questions that they themselves ask. CONFRONTATION AND VIOLENCE The release of inhibitions in drinking invariably leads to people bringing up complaints against others. Everytime they get drunk, people complain about the same things: the same affine who makes their life unbearable, the same disputed piece of land. In the normal course of events, these criticisms do not lead to arguments and violence, especially when formulated as mono- logues where a response is not being sought. However, such criticism when overheard by an interested party, say, a kinsman of the person criticized, can lead to arguments and fighting. It is as a result of direct confrontation that arguments and fights arise. In the ritual context, they usually occur when people have moved to the celebra- tory stage of drinking. Direct confrontation and arguments obviously involve power struggles of some sort and it is to be expected that language use will be an important element in such struggles, as illustrated in the following ex- ample (of which unfortunately I have no recording).25 The occasion was the Ascension Day festival, the initial stage of the huge Corpus Christi procession to the shrine of the Senior de Qoyllorrit'i (Christ of the Snow Star), situated on the slopes of Mount Sinakara and linked in both mythology and close geographical location to the powerful mountain spirit of Ausangate. The miraculous Christ figure, whose form appears etched on a rock around which the high mountain chapel has been built, at- tracts about 20,000 pilgrims to the annual festival.26 A man of low status had received one of the ritual responsibilities for the coming year and had taken the image of the Christ to his house, where a vigil had to be kept un- til the Privosti, another cargo holder, came to fetch it. During the vigil, groups of dancers came to the house to pay their respects to the image. Two high-status men from the village - celadores 'wardens' - are also tradition- ally present to ensure that the vigil is carried out correctly and with respect. Everyone was drunk. Before long, a fight broke out between the leader of one of the dance groups (the Ch'unchus) and the celadores. The dancer had failed to leave his whip on the altar, and the celadores had been very insult- ing and heavy-handed. Both sides used Quechua to hurl abuses at each other, but each used it in different ways. The dancer added diminutive suffixes to the celadores' christian names, a construction that is an insult in Quechua although it can be endearing in 19</page><page sequence="20">PENELOPE M. HARVEY Spanish. The celadores called the dancer an Indian, saying that the term had positive connotations in comparison to the brute he was. They used Quechua to try and make him feel inferior, an ignorant brute who knew no Spanish. Several hours later, another argument broke out. The Privosti's wife ar- rived saying that her husband was drunk and unable to come and collect the image but that it should be handed over to her brother who had come with her. The owner of the house, the new cargo holder, refused, saying in Quechua that he could only hand it over to the Privosti himself. He said that the village authorities had given him this cargo as a responsible and respected member of the community and he therefore had to carry out his responsi- bilities to the letter. The captain of another high-status dance group (the Qollas) tried to inter- vene with a suggestion in Spanish and was promptly told by the cargo holder to speak in Quechua. It was important to the cargo holder that the conver- sation remain in Quechua in order to defend his position. He had been speak- ing extensively in this language, defending his authority as cargo holder, and he was not going to have this position undermined by being ranked as a Quechua speaker in opposition to the other higher status Spanish speakers present. He could maintain his position by not allowing the language switch. Drunk, he dared to stand up to the Spanish speakers by declaring Quechua as the language of authority. Finally, I want to refer briefly to the way in which drunks are silenced. Again, we are dealing with confrontation but, in these cases, that between the sober and the drunk rather than between drunks. In particularly violent or difficult circumstances, the police are called, al- though this only occurs as a last resort. Before this stage is reached, friends or kin try to persuade the drunk to leave or to rest. Apart from physically removing the person, there are several other ways in which this is done. Kin, especially wives and sisters, try to silence the drunk in question with reprimands made almost under the breath, spoken quickly and sharply and accompanied by disapproving faces. Such disapproval usually serves to quiet a quarrel in the initial stages. Another strategy is to try and shame the drunks into silence by suggest- ing that they are not drinking for socially acceptable reasons and can thus be labeled as nonsocial drinkers or viciosos. The comments of a vicioso can always be discounted. They are seen as being sick and there- fore not aware of what they are saying. Thus, even if they do not stop talking, other people are reminded that they should not take any notice. Another very effective way to silence drunks or to criticize their behavior is through ridicule. The use of jokes to silence drunken speech is an effective but dangerous strategy. Part of the value of the joke, as I dis- cussed earlier, is that it bridges the socially acceptable and the non- acceptable, and the line between joke and insult is a thin one. Such 20</page><page sequence="21">BILINGUAL COMPETENCE IN THE SOUTHERN PERUVIAN ANDES attempts at silencing drunks are risky because the drunk might react with further and very direct insults with no hint of humor about them. This was the case with the quarrel on the eve of Ascension Day that I men- tioned earlier. There is, however, a general recognition of an association between alco- hol and violence. In certain offerings to the powers of the landscape, when libations are poured over models of animals, some people in the village will not use alcohol, saying that it makes the animals dangerous and aggressive. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The search for autochthonous power in the form of potency and energy is an explicit aim of drinking, expressed in the concept of animarse 'livening up'. People try to create a community base for this energy by passing alco- hol and coca around and by inviting both humans and supernatural powers to join the drinking circle. This community base is also created verbally. As people begin to get slightly drunk, they lose their shyness and begin to tell jokes, to talk and laugh together; communication among people increases. The acquired energy is expressed in the shouting, laughing, and singing and in the confidence that enables drunks to experiment with styles of speech that they do not usually employ. When I was a recent arrival in Ocongate, I told the father of the family I was living with that I was getting an assistant to help me translate during the festival of All Saints and All Souls, thinking that once people had had a few drinks they would all be speaking in Quechua. He said it was likely to be quite the opposite: "When the Mistis get drunk, they speak Quechua and nothing else, we (speak) just Spanish."27 Monolin- guals and bilinguals alike would delight in learning English when drunk and in then using the newly acquired words; such as in the much repeated phrase of this same man: nuestro cows pues 'our cows eh'. Stylistic features enhance the assertive qualities of the language employed by drunks. There is much swearing, which indicates the strength of the as- sertions being made and also increases the risk of others taking insult or resorting to ridicule. People shout a lot, volume being an important and com- mon feature of drunken speech. The forceful use of stress, pace, and pitch and the aggressive overriding of turn-taking procedures are also important in this respect. However, in the later stages of drinking the original orientation toward the creation of community switches to a situation in which drunks ignore oth- ers and are in turn ignored, in which jokes turn to insults, and in which the fulfillment of tasks for the benefit of the community changes to the constant reiteration of private concerns. People talk over each other and cannot be heard: crying and slurred articulation make speech unintelligible. Others try 21</page><page sequence="22">PENELOPE M. HARVEY to silence the drunks, and communication is denied rather than enhanced, until the drunk finally falls silent and passes out. If drinking inevitably leads people beyond the animated state to this closed and uncommunicative state of drunkenness, what exactly is the power of the drunk? What has their increased practical competence and their relative free- dom from constraint allowed them to achieve? I believe that part of the an- swer lies in the fascination with bilingualism that drunken speakers display. In Ocongate, people use bilingualism in the mediation both of their two pasts and of the legitimate and illegitimate sides of the nature of external power.28 They use it to construct social relations and to create their own sense of identity and status. As such, their response is an effective one be- cause by constructing bilingualism as the legitimate discourse, instead of ei- ther Spanish or Quechua alone, they can to a certain extent delegitimate the discourse of the external powers to which they feel subject. The outside sources of stable power are not conflated with legitimate authority. The speakers' discourse holds meaning through reference to the pasts constructed in response to their consciousness of their social position. Each past implies a distinctive option for the construction of a positive self-image in the present, and each at some level is shown to be unsatisfactory, even unrealiz- able, thus necessitating their continuing co-existence. There are thus two levels of meaning implicit in the language choice of the bilingual: (a) a reference to that particular dimension of history that is be- ing invoked as the primary referent, and (b) the secondary referent, which is the other past invoked through the suggestion of bilingualism. Speakers thus have to negotiate the ambiguity of the two pasts and to try and impose that interpretation of the past that could lend authority to their discourse. By extension, it can also be seen that context or domain, the stan- dard determiners of sociolinguistic analysis, are also negotiated. In sober in- teraction, relative practical competence can markedly put many speakers at a disadvantage in such negotiations. However, as we have seen, drunks use language in ways that their own as- sessment of their practical competence usually denies them. People who when sober would not use Spanish for fear of not being heard, of opening them- selves to ridicule or criticism, not only use Spanish but also experiment with English. Drunkenness thus allows people to evade the normative force of the dominant culture in their own search for authority. No longer tied by the constraints of practical competence, they can assert themselves as bilinguals and thus have access to the discourse of authority within the village. The problem for the drunken speaker is that, in terms of Bourdieu's met- aphor, they are unable to capitalize on this newfound competence. Just as the dead and the Awkis do not speak to the living, so the speech of drunks is not heard, or rather the implications of what is said are fiercely avoided. At the moment of consciousness, people pass out! The responsibility for their 22</page><page sequence="23">BILINGUAL COMPETENCE IN THE SOUTHERN PERUVIAN ANDES words is displaced. It is not the people themselves who speak but the drink, and great effort is put into silencing drunks, especially when a consciousness of their position leads them to cry or get violent. Their association with the dead and the Awkis is essential for the harnessing of supernatural power, but the very same association places them outside the community in the ambig- uous, other, dangerous, and ultimately silent space of death and of the spirit world. Might it not also be important in this context that drunks should lose their memory? If drunks forget, then whatever happens during a drinking session, notably experimentation with alternative meanings, should not become part of an ongoing construction of meaning in the future. Most importantly, it is the drinkers who should forget, as it is they who are making the connec- tions. Drunks cannot establish the meaning of their words if people do not listen to them. However, their creativity and their alternative expression of their social position do play a role in maintaining a vivid consciousness of contradiction and ambiguity. People put considerable energy into silencing drunks and there are complex cultural norms that distance drunken speakers from what they have said. However, the fact that they continually reiterate the same themes in the same style suggests that drunks may forget that they have spoken, but they do not forget what they have said. Drinking brings people into direct confrontation with the contradictions and ambiguities under which they live and allows for the voicing of this vi- sion that has no place in the dominant discourse of power. Drunks are most creative in the construction of new meanings or new world views. They use all the available resources, and they experiment with styles. And it is not just in terms of language; their associations with the dead and the Awkis suggest the most radical reconstruction of world view. In the section on joking, I emphasized how people focus on the ambigu- ous conditions of their existence: the ambiguity of gender relations and of the interdependence of the forces of life and death. By breaking through con- ventions of respect, drunks also reveal the facility with which power relations can be challenged by a delegitimation of hierarchy. The priests are ridiculed in the mock marriage, God is ignored by the drunken dancer. In the section on confrontation, I noted how assertions of pride in an in- sider identity and positive evaluations of the Inka past go hand-in-hand with explicit comments about the limits of kinship and hard work, neither pro- ducing what they are supposed to. People still end up alone and poor. There is a realization that their Indianness both is and is not their power. The con- tradiction is made very vivid, and it is in the connections made between the drunks and the supernatural world that the drunks most vividly express the contradictory conditions of their existence. It appears then that the power of the drunk primarily resides in the abil- ity to become explicit about the contradictions inherent in power relations 23</page><page sequence="24">PENELOPE M. HARVEY and the tensions that exist in the community. Drinking is not just about forming social relations but also involves a discussion on the nature of these relations. "Drinking expresses culture in so far as it always takes the form of a highly patterned, learned comportment which varies from one culture to another: pink elephants in one region, green snakes in another" (Douglas I987:4). Whereas I would agree that studies of alcohol use should pay particular attention to cross-cultural differences, I hope to have shown in this article that such variation essentially concerns the interpretation of the effects of al- cohol use rather than the effects themselves. Pink elephants hold different meanings for different people, meanings are disputed within even the smallest social groupings, and individuals themselves experience the contradictory op- tions for interpreting their own behavior and that of others. These options vary both historically and culturally as meanings are continuously constituted and contested in the process of human social interaction. NOTES I. Earlier versions of this article were presented to Colegio Andino, Bartolome de las Casas, Cusco, Peru, in September I987; to the Institute of Latin American Studies, Cambridge, in No- vember I987; and to the Centre for Amerindian Studies, St. Andrews, in November 1988. Dell Hymes and two anonymous readers have made extremely helpful and detailed comments, and much of their advice has been incorporated. Maurice Bloch, Peter Gow, Cecilia McCallum, Maria Phylactou, Michael Sallnow, and Christina Toren have all offered both criticism and en- couragement; I am grateful for their support. 2. For examples of Andean ethnographies that refer to drinking practices see: Allen (i988), Bastien (I978), Carter (1977), Doughty (1971), Gose (I986), Harris (1978, I980), Heath (I97I, I987b), Isbell (1978), Wagner (1978). 3. A recent exception is Saignes (I989), who discussed the use of Spanish by drunken "In- dians" in the i6th and I7th centuries. 4. Heath has produced three major reviews of this literature (1975, 1987a, 1987b) in which only one ethnographic account of drunken talk is cited (Bell 1975). Ethnosemantic studies of drinking talk have largely concentrated on the categorization of various aspects of the drink- ing experience, e.g., Frake (I964), Hage (1972), Spradley (1970), Spradley &amp; Mann (I975). 5. Bourdieu's commodity market analogy is inappropriate here. The term "capital" assumes a material reality apart from the person, something that can be owned and that can thus be alienated from the person. Emphasis is thereby put on what each party brings to the interac- tion rather than on how value is attributed to what is brought. Such a position allows that sta- tus can be relative but closes itself to the possibility, explored in this article, that relative power can be negotiated. I am grateful to Christina Toren for drawing my attention to this point. 6. 1 refer here to those areas of the Andes that experienced both Inka and Spanish colonial rule and that thus share a degree of common historical experience. However, within such broad historical parameters the Andean area admits great variability of social organization and prac- tice and should not be construed as a homogeneous cultural entity. 7. I am aware that the word drunk can carry a pejorative connotation in English. However, having considered the possibility of substituting drinker for drunk, I have decided to remain with the latter because of the importance of the fact that I refer to people who are not simply drinking, but who are getting drunk. I hope that the article makes clear that my interest is to describe the ways in which the people of Ocongate attribute meanings to the action of those who get drunk. As used in this article, the work drunk carries no moral connotation. When such con- 24</page><page sequence="25">BILINGUAL COMPETENCE IN THE SOUTHERN PERUVIAN ANDES notations are referred to, I use the indigenous terms vicio or vicioso, which are explained in the section entitled, An Ethnography of Drinking. 8. Fieldwork was carried out in this village for two years (August I983-September I985) funded by the Social Science Research Council and the University of London. Two subsequent trips in I987 and I988 were funded by the British Academy, the University of Liverpool, and the Nuffield Foundation. 9. The work of Asad (973, I986) has been particularly useful on this topic. I0. For fuller discussion on the issue of power and research methodology, see Cameron, Frazer, Harvey, Rampton, &amp; Richardson (forthcoming). I I. I refer here to the Lauramarca hacienda, a huge 65,ooo hectare estate that dominated the area from the early igth century until very recent times. Ocongate lay just outside the bound- ries of this land holding but the villagers were always intimately connected with it owing to the immense power of the landowners. Uprisings mainly concerned resistance to further land en- closure and attempts on the part of villagers to break the economic control that the landown- ers exercised over the area (see Gow I976; Harvey I987a). I2. In some areas of Southern Peru, there is a hierarchical distinction among the hill spirits. The Apu or Wamani is the most powerful, the Awki the less powerful (see e.g., Casaverde I970; Nuniez del Prado 1970; Sallnow I987; Szeminski &amp; Ansi6n I982). This distinction was not made in Ocongate. I3. There is a widespread belief in the three ages of mankind in the Andes, of which the dark age of the Machus is the first (Allen I984, I988; Casaverde 1970; Delran 1974; Gow 1976; Gow &amp; Condori I976; Harvey I987a; Nuniez del Prado 1970; OssiO 1973; Sailnow I987; Urbano I980). 14. The alcoholic content of chicha varies considerably from place to place. When buried and left to ferment, it can be very alcoholic indeed. I5. For standard grammatical explanation on this point, see Cusihuaman (I976:170-71) and Parker (I969). "Quotative past tense. This tense is regularly used in story telling, and in con- versation it indicates that the speaker is not responsible for the event, that he was unaware of the fact of, or the real significance of, the action at the time it occurred or began [e.g.,] cay sipasta mucasqani. I kissed that girl (I mistook her for another, or did it while I was drunk, or dreamt it, etc.)" (Parker I969:48-49). i6. For further discussion on the relationship between gender and drinking practices in this area, see Harvey (forthcoming). I7. Cargos are community responsibilities, particulary the sponsorship of a religious festival or the fulfillment of an administrative office. i8. For a more detailed discussion of these issues, see Harvey (I987a), Wagner (1978). I9. This literature is admirably reviewed by Heath (I975, i987a, I987b). Douglas (I987) is also an important collection. 20. For further discussion on Quechua use of metaphor, see Isbell and Roncalla (1977). 21. Both Harris (I982) and Gose (I986) have noted the symbolic relation that exists in the Andes between concepts of death and those of fertility. 22. Isbell and Roncalla (1977) discussed the use of innovative metaphor in Quechua, espe- cially in the linked activities of playing and insulting, and drew particular attention to the use of insults in sexual play. 23. Peru's political divisions in descending order are the Department, the Province, and the District. The Governor is the unsalaried civil administrator of the District, answerable directly to the Sub-Prefect and the Prefect at Provincial and Departmental levels, respectively. This is not an elected office, unlike the offices of Mayor and Municipal Councillor. 24. The disputed use of Spanish in relation to the establishment of differential status is dis- cussed in more detail with reference to language use in the judge's office in Harvey (I987b). 25. See Harvey (I989:I6-17) for a different example in which a drunken speaker interrupts a formal community meeting in which the village has brought a complaint against the local priest. The formal discussion avoids the central issue that generated the confrontation, namely that the villagers neither trust nor like the priest. However, the drunk addresses this issue directly. 26. See Sallnow (I987) for discussion of this pilgrimage and for a full bibliography. Also, see Harvey (i987a) for further discussion on language use and social differentiation associated with this cult. 27. Misti is a local term for the most economically and politically powerful members of the 25</page><page sequence="26">PENELOPE M. HARVEY community. The term most commonly takes its meaning in opposition to the Quechua term runa, meaning people and referring to the moral indigenous community, or to the term campesino 'indigenous peasant', denoting low socioeconomic status. 28. Distinct historical conditions have produced varying responses in other areas, for exam- ple, defensive monolingualism of Quechua speakers or bilingualism that simply marks a tran- sition to monolingualism in Spanish.

HARVEY APPENDIX NOTES I. The title "Doctor" is applied to the priest as a mark of respect, recognizing his knowledge and learning. The title is most usually applied to lawyers, frequently portrayed as comic figures and denoting corruption and inefficiency. 2. The reference to animals instead of humans is a repeated source of humor in this text. 3. Carajo is a very frequently used expletive, commonly heard in everyday conversation with- out causing offense. I have used fuck as a translation because the word is used in a similar sense among certain social groups in British society with similar connotations of status, age, and/or informality. The translation is not ideal, because in Quechua and Spanish usage there is no sexual connotation to the word carajo. I maintain the word in translation for the immediacy of its effect. 4. Machu refers to the men from a former age who were believed to inhabit the now ruined site of Kupi. It is thus being suggested that marriage be contracted with a supernatural being. 5. Soq'a refers to a dangerous, malevolent supernatural being who can cause sickness and death. Soq'as are also closely related to the Machus and the Awkis, having similar connections to fertility. 6. Wachay is vulgar when used to refer to a human rather than an animal birth. 36</page></plain_text>
