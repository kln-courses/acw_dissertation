<plain_text><page sequence="1">301 Neofiti Is A Study of Exodus 15 Étan Levine - Haifa Introduction The recently discovered Ms. Neofiti 1 currently being published in five volumes (*) constitutes an entirely new field of endeavor for the scholarly world: an early Palestinian paraphrase of the complete Pentateuch. Thus, significant literature is appearing, from scholars specializing in Semitic Philology, New Testament Studies, Rabbinic Literature, Theology and Paleography (2). Much of the current literature studies the relationship of the Palestinian Targum to the New Testament, philologically, literarily and theologically. This relatively new area of inquiry includes both conclusive and inconclusive documentation of the relationship (3). (x) A.

McNamara, New Testament and Targum, offers nu- merous convincing examples of relationship. However, in his "Ex. 15 and Some Aspects of the Liturgy of the Apocalypse" (pp. 199-217), bearing on the subject of this study, there is nothing to support the contention of a philological, stylistic or theological relationship between the two.

Levine However, as this study will indicate, the early origin of almost all of the Midrash in Neofiti 1 appears conclusive. The variations of Neofiti 1 from the extant targumic texts fur- ther testify to the wide diversity of the targums which were utilized until (and, to a limited extent, even after) Arabic became the lingua franca in the Near East, and Aramaic ceased to be the vernacular of the Jews ^)ģ In addition to wide substantive variation, the various Aramaic versions may be arranged according to the familiar clas- sification of New Testament synoptic variations, i.e.: a) the same paraphrase in greater or lesser detail, b) a fixed paraphrase in a dif- ferent sequence, c) the same concept expressed in different words (2). The extensive paraphrase of Neofiti 1 reflects the fact that it was not simply intended as a translation of the Hebrew Bible into vernacular Palestinian Aramaic. The additions and changes incor- porated into the targum constitute an essential source of the "oral tradition": the ideas, practices and beliefs that the populace in the synagogues were taught, reflecting contemporary religious norms and historical conditions. The targum is didactic in a further way: it explains prosaically the biblical Hebrew metaphors and expressions which were subject to misunderstanding or uncertainty. Thus, the two-fold purpose of targumic texts generally: translation and ex- plication of the biblical text. Whereas it is sometimes impossible to ascertain with certainty the "motivation" underlying Neofiti* s paraphrase or elaboration, generally the theological, halachic or historical considerations are self-evident. Frequently, parallels in ancient rabbinic literature provide indications of Neofiti' s intent.

The midrashic material found in Neofiti 1 is patently early, as both the sources and the literary style indicate (cf. sources in notes, infra). These elements frequently may be traced to intertestamental and mishnaic times (x). Despite recent cautionary reservations to the contrary, questioning the authenticity of Neofiti' $ antiquity (a), a counter-argument is appropriate. When evaluating the dating of Neofiti' s material in the light of available sources, it must be remem- bered that ascription, whether in the talmudic or pre-rabbinic liter- ature, simply provides us with a terminus ad quern (8). It in no way militates against an earlier dating, particularly in those cases where substantive, philological or stylistic criteria suggest Neofiti' s anti- quity. Furthermore, why must it be assumed a priori that the rab- binic parallels invariably constitute the "sources" for Neofiti 1, and not vice versa! Ex 15 serves as an excellent paradigm for the study of the en- tire Neofiti 1. First, this chapter consists of both poetry and prose, providing an opportunity for examining the targum's treatment of these literary modes. Second, the "Song of the Sea" was very popular among the masses of the people, and served as an essential part of the Passover liturgy. Third, the biblical text includes many words and phrases which were not readily understood in the inter-testamen- tal and rabbinic periods, thus occasioning a great amount of mid- rashic elaboration (4). Much of this elaboration is incorporated by (x) Compare the materials found in É. Levine, "The Aggadah in Targum Jonathan Ben 'Uzziel and Neofiti 1 to Genesis: Parallel Ref- erences", in the editio princeps (cf. supra), Vol. II, pp. 537-578. (2) E.g., review articles by J.

Recur-</page><page sequence="4">304 É. Levine the targumim generally, and by Targum Neofiti 1 specifically. Thus, in Ex 15 Targum Neofiti 1 constitutes an eclectic representation of a wide variety of ancient midrash. Since the beginning of the Christian era, the Song of the Sea in Ex 15 played a prominent role in Jewish liturgy and theology. The text was read on the concluding day of the Passover in the ancient synagogues, accompanied by homiletic elaborations and by escha- tological sermons (*). The earliest available rabbinic texts consider the "Song of the Sea" to be part of a song continuum that will con- clude with the "New Song" to be sung at the advent of the Mes- sianic era (a). For, as St. Jerome correctly attests, there was a wide- spread Jewish idea that the Messiah would arrive to redeem Israel on the Passover: "Traditio Judaeorum est Christum media nocte venturum in similitudinem Aegyptii temporis, quando pascha ce- lebratum est" (8). According to traditional Jewish sources, this religious event was the high-point of Divine revelation, to the extent that "even the woman slave saw more of the Shekinah of God at the Red Sea than the prophet Ezekiel was ever permitted to be- hold!" (4). According to Rabbi Jose the Galilean (c. 110 A.D.), even the infants beheld the Shekinah at the Red Sea, whereupon they sang this song of Ex 15 to Him (6). Philo of Alexandria contended that the sacred song and dance of the Therapeutae were simple imitations of the Song of Moses and Miriam upon Israel's salvation at the Red Sea (6). This present study analyzes Neofiti' s exegesis of Ex 15. The text and apparatus criticus of the ms. have been taken from the rent themes include: God's revelation, the eschatological significance of the Song of the Sea, the justification of God's destruction of the Egyp- tian hosts, the reasons for Israel's salvation; the method by which the miracle was performed, the reactions of Israel at the sea, and related themes.

Because horses and their riders had exalted themselves by pursuing the people, the Children of Israel, he cast and drowned them in the Reed Sea. The most elaborate version of this 'aggadah is found in Mekilta * (Shirata* 2,2) depicting divine retribution, measure for measure, against all of the notoriously arrogant: the generation of the flood, the Sodomites, the Egyptians who pursued Israel, Sisera et al. Sim- ilarly, Exodus Rabbah (23,12) describes the arrogance of all of God's creatures, with God exalted above the arrogant. Neofiti 1 reflects the talmudic idea ( T.B . Hagigah 13B) that this song is "a song to Him who is exalted above the arrogant". Similarly, Ps.J. explains, "Thus, when Pharaoh the Wicked bore himself arrogantly before the Lord, and arrogantly in his heart pursued the people of the Children of Israel, their horses and their chariots He threw and buried in the Reed Sea". Cf. T.B. Hagigah 13B; Ex.R. 23,12; Tanhuma* (ed. Buber) 14; Mekilta ' Shir ata ' 2,2; Mekilta*, Beshallah 6; for parallels of lex ta- lionis , see P.R.E.

In addition to the substantive variations to the biblical text, Neofiti contains several stylistic variations. These include: n 3 ("praised") for lltP ("and they sang"); ratti mi ("we will thank and praise") for HTPN ("I will sing"), etc. These are characteristic of Neofiti, which is not always exact in preserving the correct tense or person, or conforming to "correct" grammatical translation. These stylistic irregularities throughout Neofiti , familiar in popular</page><page sequence="7">Neofiti 1 : A Study of Exodus 15 307 Palestinian Aramaic texts, further indicate the origin of the text of Neofiti (cf. summary for further discussion).

The word "children" refers to infants, and not to the "Children of Israel". Thus, M.: "From their mothers' breasts the infants sig- nalled with their fingers to their fathers, and said to them: This is our father who suckled us with honey from the rock, and anointed us with oil from flint-stone. The Children of Israel replied and said to each other: This is our God and we will praise him, the God of their fathers and we will extoll him". Ps.J. contains a more extensive version, explaining that the infants told their fathers, "This is our God who nourishes us with honey from the rock, and with oil from the clay stone. When our mothers went forth upon the face of the field to give birth to us, and to leave us there, he sent an angel who washed us and swaddled us. And now we will praise him.

According to his name, so is his power. Blessed be his name forever and ever. By changing the biblical "war" to pl., Neofiti alludes to the concept explicitly stated in Ps.J .: "From generation to generation he makes his power manifest to the people of the House of Israel. . .". The concept is stated in extenso in Mekiltcf : "Scripture, therefore, would not let the nations have an excuse for saying that there are two powers, but declares: Adonai is a man of war (Ex 15,3). He it is who was in Egypt, and he who was at the sea. It is he who was in the past, and he who will be in the future. It is he who is in this world, and he who will be in the world to come. As it is said: See now, it is I, even I, am he (Dt 22,29). And it also says: Who hath wrought and done it? He that called the nations from the beginning. I, the Lord, who am the first, and with the last am the same (Is 41,4)". (See Lauterbach, Mekiltà! de-Rabbi Ishma^el [Philadelphia 1949] Vol. II, pp. 31 f.). In brief, the homiletic function of the ' aggadah (and Neofiti ad h.l.) is to convey the idea of God's ongoing interven- tion, as a source of consolation and inspiration for Israel. Like the Peshitta* , Neofiti subtly alters the biblical phrase mrp nttnVö BPH (= "the Lord is a man of war") to "TDS? K1311 (see translation above; cf. A. Diez Macho: " Yahweh es varón guerrero"), to lessen the anthropomorphism. The various midrashim specify that his intervention is not battle for battle's sake, but for the red- emption of Israel, which requires militant action? Cf. N. and F.T. ad vv. 2 and 18, and loc. par. ad h. locos; see Me- kilta' Shirata ' 1; Mekiltď de R.S. 70-71; P.K. loc. cit.; T.B . Shabbat 103B.

Ps.J. reads similarly, but without the reference to fire arrows, which is found in Neofiti and in Mekilta ', Shir ata? 6,2: "When the first of the Egyptians went down into the sea, the angels on high began hurling at them arrows../'. The word nnaö is understood as a noun by Rashi (cf. commen- tary ad h.l.), thus, "the choice ones"; Driver renders it "his chosen" (cf. The Book of Exodus [1911] ad h.L) Like Ps.J., Neofiti translates TtřTO as ("his strong ones"), simply because the technical meaning of the biblical term was unknown. Neofiti doubly translates 1S73Ö ("drowned") as 57ÖB1 mi ("threw and drowned") as a reaction to the difficult i1Ö*l (lit. "raised") in v. 1. (cf. F.

M. adds further: "And in the greatness of your power you broke the walls of the enemies. . . Neofiti first specifies the "enemy" by inserting "Pharaoh"; then, after translating "enemy" once (3*18 = nNÏP), it adds the synonymous AMT without specification. M.2 reads this pl., since its intent (and probably the intent of N. as well) is to imply analogy to other enemies of Israel, as stated in Ps.J. and specified (e.g. Esau) in the midrashic literature in extenso . Thus, just as God's mighty hand destroyed Pharaoh, so will the other enemies of Israel be destroyed. By translating mNl as NT Tfl HÖ ("How mighty"), N.

These, as well as the variations found in N. are contained in Ps.J. ad h.l. (Cf. F. T. for alternate version). As in v. 6, Neofiti specifies that the "enemy" referred to are the enemies of Israel (and not mythological enemies attacking God). This is even more explicit in M. (transposed to v. 6) and in Ps.J. and F.T. ad h.L, where the walls of these enemies are mentioned, in distinction to a) celestial antagonists, and b) Pharaoh's armies at the sea. The allusion, of course, is to the future enemies of Israel (or, alternatively, the enemies of the righteous, as the later exegesis has it).

They remained bound, like water- bags of flowing water. The depths congealed in the midst of the great sea. By rendering "pDK miai as "by a Word from before you", N. simply replaces a gross anthropomorphism with a more subtle one. According to S. D. Luzzato ÇOheb Ger [Cracow 1905] pp. 3, 8, et sqq.) all that motivates alterations such as these (e.g. Targum Onkelos ad Gn 8,21) is reverence, and not a philosophical principle (cf. M. Ka- dushin, The Rabbinic Mind [New York 1952] 335 f.; also see discus- sion of anthropomorphism and corporeality infra , in summary). The translation of N is similar to Ps.J. and F.T., regarding the heaps of water (cf. Mekilta9, Shir ata ' 6,3). In translating the Bible's cVni "Tl 1DD lasi N faced a dual problem: a) what is the meaning of the Hebrew 101571 and b) how could waters stand? It solved the problem by rendering the word Tl as the homonymous TKl (= water-bag), in common use in the ancient Near East. The Hebrew word 1!IS1 thus became "they remained" (rather than "they stood"). This rendition is found in the Peshiffa* as well. (Contrast Rashi, 'Ibn 'Ezra' et al ; the wide interpretation "wall" follows the Arabic: nedh, i.e., a mound of earth = jo nadd in Arabic). See Arukh Com- pletimi s.v. pT, and lì Teshubot ha-Geonim, ed. Harkavy, 35, where *71 is translated as KpT, i.e. TKl. Similarly, the Peshitta * reads "TRI.

And I will capture many captives from them, and will plunder much spoil from them. I will divide the loot among my people, the warriors. And when I am satiated from them, I will unsheathe my sword, and my right hand shall destroy them. N interprets contra rabbinic exegesis ( T.B . Menahot 36B, 37 A) that any unspecified hand in the Bible signifies the left hand. Neofiti injects this non-rabbinic ' 'right hand" in apparent reaction to the poem's frequent use of "right hand" as applied to God (e.g. vss. 6, 12). Neofiti here freely paraphrases a biblical text which is onomato- poetic (five-fold repetition of firima 9 Aleph) and metric. It does so, apparently, because the poetry is terse to the point of obscurity, without specifying object and place of confrontation.

Further, it renders /fcT *ia i.e., "the waters of the sea covered them". These alterations precluded both anthropomorphic and mythological implications implied by the Hebrew text, and familiar to Near Eastern epic poetry.

The sea was saying to the land: Accept your children. And the land was saying to the sea: Accept your slain. Neither the sea nor the land wanted to receive them. The land feared the Great Judgement Day, lest it be required of her in The-World-To-Come. Immediately you raised your right hand in an oath, O Lord, that you would not require them of her in The- World-To-Come. And the earth opened its mouth, swallowing them. The biblical reference to the earth swallowing the Egyptians (rather than the sea), constitutes the crux which N explains. In the process of its exegesis it incorporates the rabbinic doctrine of the Great Judgement Day. "Earth" here signifies Sheol : the word ("earth, land") like ersitu in Akkadian, and like yars in Ugaritic, sometimes serves as a designation for Sheol. Cf. similarly Ps.J. and F.T.

When your children saw your explicit miracles by the sea, and your might amidst the waves, they immedi- ately opened their mouths in unison, and said: The kingship is the Lord's, from before the world, and until all worlds. N emphasizes the proclamation of God's Kingdom. A more elaborate version is found in the other targumim. Thus, Ps.J . reads: "When the people of the House of Israel beheld the signs and rev- elations which the Holy One, blessed be his Name, had done at the Reed Sea, and the power of his hand, the children of the captives responded, saying to each other: Come and let us place the crown of kingship on the head of our redeemer who causes to pass over but does not pass over; who causes change but does not change; whose is the crown of the kingdom, the king of kings in this world; whose, too, is the kingdom in the World-To-Come, forever and ever". The intent of N . and of Ps.J . is explicit in F.T. Ms. Paris #110, which contains ad h.l. the i(midrash of the four nights", which the other targum texts insert ad Ex 12,42. In this homily, the night of Passover (lit. "night of watching") is the fourth in a series. The first Passover night was that of creation; the second was when God was revealed to Abraham to announce Isaac's forthcoming birth; the third was the Passover of the Exodus. Concerning the fourth night, Ms. Paris #110 reads, "The fourth night is when the world will have completed its appointed time for revelation.

N may also reflect the following: "The kingship of God negates, basically, the dominion of the nations of the world over Israel. They rule over Israel, the Rabbis state, only because Israel said: 'The Lord will reign (in the future) for ever and ever'.

And they went a distance of three days into the wilderness, and they did not find water. Characteristically, Neofiti replaces unfamiliar biblical place names with familiar place names, known in fact or in legend. Here, is one of several extant alternatives (cf. B. Smerler, ' Ahabat Yonatan, Vol. I [Bilgary 5692 A.M.] p. 141 for variants). This is the choice of F.T. also. Neofiti may represent an earlier (i.e., less developed) allusion to the midrash contained in Ps.J.: ". . .and they went forth to the wilderness of Halusa. And they journeyed three days in the desert, devoid of Tor ah, and found no water". The place name risieri, of course, is a construction of îwVn, the ceremony of the refusal of levirate marriage with a kinsman's widow. The symbo- lism is apt, considering the widespread motif of the marriage of Israel to the Law (cf. references infra). The halusa homily implicit in N. and explicit in Ps.J. is an early Palestinian allegory, representative of the oldest form of Palestinian exposition (fflřm) used by the niÖWl "»ttHVT, i.e. "Symbolists", (lit. "interpreters of signs"). They were also termed fflTlön WVÏÏ i.e., "interpreters of parables". And they were already archaic in 70 A.D. Their method was symbolically allegorical; thus "they found no water" means "no Torah", as in Is 55,1 (see T.B. Berakot 24A; com- pare L. Ginzberg, On Jewish Law and Lore [Philadelphia 1955] 133).

It is explained to mean that "If you obey, I will not bring, and if you do not obey, I will bring; how- ever, despite this, I am the Lord your healer" (Mekilta*, Shir atei Ch. 2). Neofiti specifies the "evil plagues" sent upon the Egyptians because the ten plagues were "diseases" which God was capable both of bringing and healing. This is also the intent of Ps.J., where the text is expanded into, . .all those evil things which I placed upon the Egyptians I will not place upon you.

There is a long excursus by Philo (Vita Mosis I, 34), in which he allegorizes in extenso , explaining the twelve springs and seventy date-palm trees as symbolizing the twelve tribes and seventy elders, and the characteristics of fruitfulness, gentleness, uplift, spirituality and blessing that these symbols are intended to suggest. A less allegorical, early rabbinic source reads: "R. El'azar of Modin says, 'From the day the Holy One blessed be He created the world, He created the twelve pools corresponding to the twelve tribes, and the seventy palms corresponding to the seventy elders"'</page><page sequence="24">324 É. Levine ( Mekilta ' de R.S. 74; M. H. G. #319). Parenthetically, whereas it may be possible for the rabbinic sources, even Mekilta *, to have been taken from an early Palestinian targum (e.g. Neofiti , and not Ps.J.), it is less likely that Philo used this source!

Diez Macho, Neophyti 1, Vol. II, intro., p. 79. Summary A. An analysis of Ex 15 reveals the essential features which are characteristic of Targum Neofiti in its entirety (*). It is an Aramaic paraphrase written in a popular, frequently discursive style. When it digresses from literal translation, it incorporates both juridical and homiletic midrash. This material is fused directly into the bib- lical text, forming a continuous literary unit. The variations of Neofiti from the Hebrew text are most usually additive, and occasion- ally substitutive; they are never deletions. Since Neofiti' s primary purpose is exegetical, this usually involves elaboration, occasionally alteration, but never deletion of a biblical text. B. The stylistic variations of Neofiti are manifold, although less than the extensive variations found in the other extant Palestinian targumim. The stylistic variations are frequently due to the fact that Neofiti (unlike Targum * Onkelos ) is a "folk translation" based upon the spoken Aramaic of ancient Palestine. Consequently, there are frequent changes of person (pl. to sing., and vice versa) within a verse, as well as changes of tense. Neofiti* s frequent recourse to synonyms constitutes a serious problem for the scholar: to reconstruct the associations, nuances and precise shades of meaning which distinguish between a word and its synonym uti- lized by the targum. Thus, whereas there may be no difference in (*) The most complete and detailed studies are those found in the introductions of A. DÍEZ Macho, Neophyti 1.</page><page sequence="25">Neofiti 1 : A Study of Exodus 15 325 meaning between the Hebrew 13TD and the targum's (v. 17), or between the Hebrew and the targum's *ltm (v. 19), there is a difference of implication between the Hebrew 1SHÎ and the targum's sn*TX *]lj?rn (v. 17). Obviously, the difference between *T3 and the homonymie TK2 (v. 8) is a substantive one. Thus, the var- iants in Neofiti may be divided into those which are simply Stylistic, and those which are Substantive; the distinction is crucial, albeit occasionally most difficult to ascertain. C. As the rabbinic loca parallela indicate, Neofiti is an eclectic compilation consisting primarily of early Palestinian material (*). A close reading of these parallels to the midrash in Ex 15 reveals that the material contained in Mekilta ' is closest. Despite the fact that parallels are generally available in the early rabbinic literature, occasionally an element in Neofiti has no parallel throughout this literature (2), and may tentatively be cat- alogued as an original creation of the targumist himself. The parallels indicate that Neofiti contains earlier and less ex- tensive additive elements than do the other Palestinian targumim . Although it is apparently the earliest extant Palestinian targum, it has not been subject to the same on-going accretion process which transformed the others into virtual midrashim. Not only is Neofiti more concise than its Palestinian counter- parts; frequently it is more consistent. Thus it does not contain the internal contradictions which these do (3). And there are only oc- casional double-translations (e.g. Ex 14,30 M.T. = WH; N. = p'HDI biro). In those places where Neofiti is more expansive than ' Onqelos , it is almost invariably less elaborate than the alternative versions (4). Frequently Neofiti is briefer than * Onqelos, and does not include a juridical or homiletic element contained in it (6). D. Neofiti digresses from literal translation for two reasons: Intrinsic textual problems within a biblical verse, and Extrinsic didactic purposes. (x) Cf. sources, supra , and É.

Levine The intrinsic textual problems include: philological difficulty (*), lacunae (2), redundance (8), similes and metaphoric terms (4), ho- monymie words (6). The Extrinsic factors involve issues of theological, polemical or homiletical concern, in the light of the didactic concern for combatting sectarianism, heresy, or inroads into orthodox Jewish belief and practice. This involves such issues as: glorification of God's might; God's power over good and evil; God's power over the Spirit; God's love of Israel, and Israel's reciprocating; Nomism and the normative law; the great judgement day; theodicy; na- tionalistic encouragement; combatting anthropomorphism, and the mythological fragments incorporated in the Hebrew text; the ef- ficacy of repentance and prayer (6). E. In Ex 15 (as throughout this targum), the following types of alterations and additions are found: Emphasis, Detail, Identifi- cation, Specification, Extension, Relation, Analogy, Simplification (7). F. Neofiti 1 and Biblical Poetry. The question of Neofiti 's treatment of biblical poetry becomes all the more cogent in the light of recent discoveries of targumic versions of the Song of the Sea, written in poetic form (8). In these, a definite metric system, and rhymed couplets are discernable. In fact, one is written in an alphabetic acrostic (•), a style familiar in (!) E.g. the doubled verb TtH 1 in v. 1; the obscure iman in v. 2; the inappropriate Hebrew TMW1*? instead of SPttHD1? in v. 2. (a) E.g. the apparent lacunae in the description of Pharaoh's plans (v. 9). (3) E.g., the doubled run in v. 1, and the apparently redundant •mei nnzrK in v. 16. (4) For numerous similes and metaphoric terms cf. supra in situ (e.g. v. 8). (6) Since the early Hebrew texts were neither pointed nor supplied with matres lectionis, the targum explains those homonymie words which could be confused, e.g. 11 and *TK1 in v. 8. (•) Virtually every one of these themes is implied by the midrashic elements found in Neofiti 1 ad Ex 15!

Neofiti* s treatment of the poetry in Ex 15 may be considered archtypal, considering the liturgical pre-eminence of this chapter. The biblical Hebrew contains several poetic devices which may be used for the purpose of comparison with Neofiti. The poem is divided into three strophes (vv. 1-6; 7-11; 12-16) and an epilogue (vv. 17-18). At the conclusion of each of the three strophes, there is a word-repetition, to stress the finale (v. 6: Thy right hand, O Lord. . . Thy right hand, O Lord; v. 11: Who is like you. . . Who is like you; v. 16: till pass by. . . till pass by). Before each concluding repetition of the strophe, there is a simile (v. 5: like a stone; v. 10: as lead; v. 16 as a stone). The rhythm is mainly quaternary, in part ternary, with very few exceptions; the poem is frequently alliterative (e.g. the alliteration of five consecutive words in v. 9 beginning with ' aleph ). Neofiti constitutes both a literal translation and paraphrase on the one hand, and a midrashic elaboration on the other, thus ren- dering a real difficulty for the poetic meturgeman. Preservation of the alliteration and of the metre would be well-nigh impossible. However, Neofiti has preserved the other poetic devices, including the strophe format. Thus, at the end of each strophe, Neofiti repeats those words which mark the conclusion: v. 6: ffiyp *]TW "Your right hand, O Lord"; v. 11: HDÖD ^ "Who is like you!"; v. 16: 13ST1 1ÌÌ "until pass by". Similarly, Neofiti preserves the three biblical similes which precede each repetition; v. 5: pK IM "like a stone"; v. 10: mDlSD "as lead"; v. 16: pXD "as stones". In sum, although Neofiti bears none of the characteristics of the later Hebrew poetry, it does preserve as much of the biblical rendition as is possible within a midrashic paraphrase and extension. G. Neofiti and Anthropomorphism: In studying Neofiti 1: Ex 15, one is impressed by the apparent lack of a consistent principle re- garding God's corporeality and anthropomorphism. Thus, in vv. 6 which entered the Bodleian library after the redaction of A. E. Cowley, Catalogue of the Hebrew Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, Vol. II (Oxford 1906), is in a poor state of preservation. However, throughout the fragment (fol. 5A = Ex 15,7-13; fol. 5B = Ex 15,13-21), the text is divided into poetic lines; the text is in too poor a condition to allow the determination of whether a definite rhyme scheme exists.</page><page sequence="28">328 É. Levine and 12, "Your right hand" is translated literally, whereas in v. 9 the Hebrew "and by a breath of your nostrils" is paraphrased as "and by a decree (lit. "word") from before you", an anti-anthropo- morphic circumlocution. Despite the numerous similar circum- locutions throughout Neofiti (x), there appears to be no absolute rule; within the very same verse one finds both anthropomorphic literalism and anti-anthropomorphic paraphrase (2). So too is the case with the glosses of Neofiti : most frequently they provide added circumlocution, but often they add blatant anthropomorphism and corporeal description (8). This feature of Ms. Neofiti 1 must be an- alyzed within the larger context of the other targumim (4) ; the issue, essentially, is the corporeality or incorporeality of God, as conceived of by the Neofiti targumist and his sources. The question is not an altogether modern one. According to Sa'adya, Maimonides and other Jewish philosophers of the middle ages, the primary function of 'Onkelos was to negate anthropomor- phism and the belief in God's corporeality (6). It is for this reason, they argue, that 'Onkelos paraphrases any biblical term or phrase which implies corporeality: he was intent upon excising this "false" idea, and replacing it with the "true" meaning of the biblical text. Maimonides explains that since motion implies corporeality, 'Onkelos correctly interprets divine motion as revelation, or as the motion of a divinely created manifestation (i.e. yeqara' memrcf , shekinah, dibbura '). Therefore 'Onkelos translates "the lord will come down (Ex 19,11)" as "the Lord will reveal himself"; "and the Lord came down (ibid., v. 20)" as "and the Lord revealed himself". Maimonides offers numerous examples of instances in which 'Onkelos' paraphrase is intended to excise implications of anthropomorphism, and he outlines a principle according to which 'Onkelos rendered terms such as "hear", "smell", "see", as applied to. God. Where Maimon- ides encountered exceptions to this principle, he attributed them to textual corruption of Targum 'Onkelos, a scribal error, or a specific H E.g. Gn 4,13; 8,21; 17,22; 20,17.

Maimonides' attempt to establish a consistent principle in 'Onkelos is a result of the fact that he was convinced that 'Onkelos intended to convey God's in- corporeality. Nahmanides rigorously refuted the entire thesis, claiming that the talmud and midrash literature amply prove that the terms used in the targumim (cf. supra) are actually appellatives for God. He further claims that the principle used by 'Onkelos is a mystical one, known only to initiates into the Kabbalah. He demonstrates by numerous examples that 'Onkelos was not addressing the problem of anthropomorphism, and that his deviations from literal translation do not reflect this concern (2). In attempting to reconcile these classical, divergent positions, Isaac 'Abarbanel (3) distinguished between anthropomorphisms that imply a change in God (e.g. motion, action), and anthropomorphisms that refer to God's will, or word (e.g. thinking, speaking). Isaac 'Arama (4) rejected both the philosophical approach of Maimonides and the mystical approach of Nahmanides. According to him, the misunderstanding concerning the tar gum is due to the fact that 'Onkelos' departures from literal rendition are not due to any one principle, but to several. The terms Yeqara' Memra ' and Shekintâ each convey a different sense of respect and reverence, and only occasionally are they intended to combat anthropomorphism and the implication of God changing. A. D. Luzzatto (5) agreed with 'Arama. He understood 'Onkelos' concern to be lest actions and attributes be attributed to God which might lower his honor and stature in the popular mind. He explains that since God's honor is the issue, occasionally 'Onkelos simply exchanges one anthropomorphism with another more dignified one. Kadushin maintains that "since Targum Onkelos is a rabbinic version (...the Rabbis speak of Targum Onkelos as "our Targum" - Ķiddushin 49a.), it is once more evident that philosophy and Í1) Cf.

Levine rabbinic thought are two distinct and different worlds. To employ any philosophic criterion in an approach to Targum Onkelos leads us nowhere. We cannot speak of Targum Onkelos, therefore, as making a principle either of the incorporeality of God or of the cor- poreality of God". He declares further, that "Targum Onkelos, so authentically rabbinic as to be characterized by the Rabbis as 'our Targum', emphasizes the idea of God's otherness" (*). I submit that the case with 'Onkelos and with Neofiti is different from that suggested. First, the designation "our targum" [targum didan) is exclusively a geographic designation, referring to the Bab- ylonian community, rather than the Palestinian (and not to des- ignate rabbinic, rather than non-rabbinic). Furthermore, a reread- ing of ' Onkelos and a reading of Neofiti suggest that Y. Kaufman is essentially correct in stating that the verses in question in 'Onkelos reflect the belief in God's corporeality (2). Further, that the devi- ations in the targum reflect and are intended to convey sublimity, but not incorporeality! According to Kaufman, a reading of the earliest rabbinic texts demonstrates that the early rabbis believed that God is corporeal. Our targum reflects this belief; the concept of sublimity it stresses is apparently an intermediate step in the separation of God from contact with matter. The fact is that Targum Neofiti is not consistent in its circum- locutions, or in its application of "buff er- words" (8), which reflects an ongoing development of the sense of God's "otherness" and in- corporeality. The anti-anthropomorphic elements are typical of Jewish religious polemic of the 1st century. The inconsistent nature of the text reflects the fact that the targum was not subject to a rigorous editing by later religious authorities. The anthropomorphic elements, the corporeal references and similar material reflect a pre- philosophical period, before Judaism was involved in polemic, and in philosophical concerns. H. The importance of further study of Neofiti can scarcely be exaggerated.
