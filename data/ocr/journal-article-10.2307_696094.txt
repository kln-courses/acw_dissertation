D'ARBOIS DE JUBAIN- VILLE, Membre de l'Institut. Paris, Ancienne Librairie Thorin et Fils, A. Fontemoing 6diteur. 1899. In 8vo. Pp. xv., 418. Price 8 francs. THE book before us forms vol. vi. of a general series entitled Cours de Litterature Celtique, edited by d'Arbois de Jubainville with the collaboration of well-known Celtic scholars. Vol. i, is a general introduction to the study of Celtic literature, vol. ii. is devoted to Celtic mythology, vols. iii., iv. are taken up with translations of the Welsh romances known as the Mabinogion, vol. v. deals with the Irish epic tales, and the translations it contains are extremely valu- able as illustrations of the Celtic side of the arguments in the sixth volume. In the preface to the present work, the writer takes the reader into his confidence and thus describes the genesis of his book: ' Une etude grammaticale, entreprise il y a deux ans, m'a fait parcourir les premiers livres de l'lliade : je voulais y recueillir des exemples de tm6se analogues A ceux que nous offre le vieil irlandais . . . . Je connaissais fort mal la litt'rature hom4rique, dont je m'6tais tres peu occupd depuis ma sortie du coll6ge, c'est-A-dire depuis plus de cinquante ans. Recommengant A lire Hombre, j'ai 6t6 surpris des nombreuses ressemblances que la civilisation d6crite dans l'lliade et I'Odyssie offre avec celle que nous ddpeignent les auteurs grecs et latins quand ils nous montrent ce qu'6taient les Celtes indd- pendants pendant les trois premiers sibcles qui ont precedd l'6re chr6tienne, et plus tard, pendant toute la dur'e de l'empire romain d'Occident. Que dis-je I M1me apres la chute de cet empire, la plus ancienne litter- ature de 1'Irlande nous offre encore le tableau de la meme civilisation dans cette fle au commencement du moyen age' (pp. ix., x). At the end of the book he sums up as follows: 'Les Gaulois, pendant les trois sidcles qui ont prec6dd notre ore, les Irlandais, tels que nous les d6peint leur littdrature epique la plus ancienne, mise par 4crit dans le moyen Age, 6taient A peu pros au meme degr6 de civilisation que les Grecs et les Troyens de l'dpopde hom6rique environ huit cents ans avant J4sus-Christ' (p. 395). M. d'Arbois has succeeded in producing a very interesting book on quite a new subject; indeed with the materials at his disposal, he could not easily have failed to do so. All scholars now agree in assigning to the Celtic languages and literatures the importance they really deserve in the history of Indo- Germanic philology, civilisation, and mytho- logy. Much has been written on Celtic grammar and folk-lore, but this is the first attempt to bring Greek and Celt side by side and compare in detail their ways and customs. Our authorities on the early Celts fall naturally into two distinct groups: (1) Greek and Roman writers, beginning with the third century B.c. ; their information refers almost exclusively to the Gauls and Britons: (2) the oldest Irish legends and sagas. This second source, though far later in date than most of our classical authori- ties, is the most important for our present purpose. Considerable information may, with careful sifting, be also gathered from early Welsh literature, as the Mabinogion and the Lives of the Saints. It is somewhat surprising that M. d'Arbois has not made more use of early Welsh writings, from which many an interesting parallel might have been supplied, where an Irish one is wanting. Although the oldest extant Irish MS.' containing epic stories was written as late as the year 1100 (circa), the origin of these old tales is to be sought in pagan Ire- land long before the coming of Patrick and the-Gospel. Originally the legends were out- and-out pagan and ' brutal' in tone, though by no means lacking in a certain sense of chivalry and tenderness of thought. With the introduction of Christianity, the coarser parts were either toned down or rigidly sup- pressed ; Christian interpolations were made, and by judicious 'editing' on the part of monastic scribes the old epic became an incon- gruous mixture of pagan and Christian ideas; but even in the late form we possess it is by no means difficult to separate the different parts, as the monks contented themselves with superficial changes and did not trouble themselves about scrupulous consistency; Christian connections being found for the heathen heroes, the latter were allowed 1 The Book of the Dun Cow, Lebar na huidre, published in facs. by the Royal Irish Academy, 1870.</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. 329 to retain their character of cruel and savage fighting-men.1 The following is a summary of the main parts of d'Arbois' book :- Chapter I. Observations priliminaires. One important point of contrast in the two civilisations is due to a difference of date, viz., in Homeric society the use of iron is quite exceptional, among the Celts it is very common. One point of resemblance is noticed by Diodorus Siculus (v. 28):-- Tots 8'ayaovos avspas ra^L KaXXIcrTaL~ "7v KPEOWV (OLpaL9 yEpaLpvOUcL [KeXroL], KaOarep Oc 7rorL?7Tp Tov AZlavra 7rapCerdyet rTL/LWOEVov vr7o TrOV aptrTJo1v T k rpts "EKTOpa ovopaXL(Oas EVLK?70E, 'NTrow-v 8'Aav"a sLrqVEKEO'O-L y palpEv.' 2 Then come examples of duels between warriors of opposing armies from Homer, 1 Our store of Irish epic literature is rich and varied: much has been published and translated, and more still remains untouched. Facsimiles of the most important MS. collections have been published by the R. Ir. Acad., e.g. Book of Leinster, Book of Lecan; editions of texts with translations, notes, and discussions, may be seen in La Revue C(eltique (Paris), Meyer and Stern's Zeitschrift fiir Celtische Philologie (Halle, Niemeyer ; London, Nutt), and Windisch and Stokes' Irische Texte, several series (Leipzig, Hirzel). The following deal fully with an important branch of the Irish epic: The Cuchullin Saga (1898, Nutt), with an introduction by Miss Eleanor Hull, who acts as editor, and translations from the Irish by eminent Celtic scholars, The Feast of Bricriue [the 'poison-tongued,' the Irish Thersites], edited and translated by G. Henderson, M.A., Ph.D. (1900, Irish Texts Society). The most complete list of MSS. containing epic tales is d'Arbois de Jubainville's Essai d'un Catalogue de la Littdrature ipique de l'Irlande (Paris, Thorin, 1883). To classical students the following short list of Irish versions of Greek and Latin classics may be of some interest:- The Odyssey.--Merugud Uilix (Book of Ballymote= B.B. end of 14th cent.), edited by Kuno Meyer. (Nutt.) The Aeneid (B. B. ).-Books I.-IV., edited with Eng. trans. by T. Hudson Williams in Zeitschriftfiir Celtische Philologie, II. Band, 3 Heft. The Destruction of Troy (Dares Phrygius).-Numer- ous versions exist, e.g. Book of Leinster (12th cent.), B. B., Trin. Coll. H. 2, 17 (14th cent. ?), edited with Eng. trans. by Whitley Stokes in Irische Texte ii. 1. One of the many Welsh versions is published in Rhys and Evans's Red Book of Hergest (14th cent.), Vol. II. (Oxford, 1890). The History of Alexander the Great (after Orosius).- In the Lebar Brecc (end 14th cent.) and B. B.; edited, with Germ. trans., by Kuno Meyer in Ir. Texte, ii. 2. Lucan's Pharsalia.-Cath Catharda, in Stowe MS. No. 992 (14th or 15th cent.). and Celtic parallels from Roman history, e.g. the exploits of Torquatus, Corvus3 and others: instances of similar fights from Irish romances. Comparison of Iliad III. 146-243, with an Irish TraXoGOKorla (Cours de L. C. v. pp. 80-148). Classical writers refer to the Celtic custom of taking dogs to fight for their masters in war (Strabo, iv. c. 5, ? 2, Appian Celtica, xii.) In Irish literature the ' war-hound '4 is a well-known figure : one famous hound, Ailbe, 'was worth a whole army.' ' Dog' is a very common element in Irish names, e.g. Cg-roi, Cu-chulainn.5 The war-hound is quite un- known to Homer. In the Iliad and Odyssey dogs and birds attack dead men only. Though we have a few Homeric instances of the dog as 'the friend of man,' on the whole he is despised by the Greek and Trojan warriors, among whom 'dog' is a common term of abuse. The influence of women is a very prominent feature in the Irish epic: Plutarch, de mul. virt. vi., refers to a treaty between Hannibal and the Gauls, in which the wives of the latter are to decide in questions of dispute. Chapter II., La Societe. In Homer and Celtic literature the poets and seers are a class apart from the priests. Their influence was very great, even the sovereign, Agamem- non, had to bow before the decision of Calchas; of the Gaulish seers Diodorus says 7ryv To r7rX-^Oo EXOVO-LV vy7qKOOV. Divin- ation from the flight of birds was common to Greeks and Celts, also from the dying movements of sacrificial victims (in Gaul human), and from dreams. We are not told in the Iliad and Odyssey how to dis- tinguish a true from a false dream; the Irish Celt knew how to do so. The intend- ing dreamer must be a file ('seer, *ueles, genit. *ueletos, Welsh gweled: the Germ. Ueleda, Tac. Hist. iv. 61, is borrowed from the Celtic), must sacrifice a red pig, a cat, or a dog, then eat a portion of the victim and offer the rest to the gods: after reciting a spell, then another spell 'over his two hands,' he must lie down and fall asleep with his head between his hands. His hAn interesting parallel to the story of the crow helping the Roman warrior is found in one of the Welsh Arthurian tales, Breudwyt Ronabwy, in which Owein, a knight of Arthur's company, has a flock of crows which fight for their master on seeing his standard raised.

Celt. v. pp. 80-148, and Henderson's Feast of Bricriu.</page><page sequence="3">330 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW, dreams will be true ones. Among the Romans and Greeks (not Homeric) the process was less complicated: the would-be seer had only to sleep on the skins 1 of the victims in the temple or sacred wood of the god who was to send the dream. (Vergil, Aen. vii. 81-101.) The Druids, a class distinct from the bard and seer (Strabo, iv. c. 5 ? 4), differ from the Homeric LEPeVp' in that they form a close corporation and are not attached to any temple or to the service of any particular deity: their position is higher than that of the Epev's since the presence of a Druid was essential to the validity of every sacrifice. The Druids belonged to the aristocracy, the seers and poets to the Celtic bourgeoisie. This middle class, intermediate between the noble and common plebeian, consisted of the professional soldier; the seer (Hom. paivrTL) : the carpenter, smith, and worker in bronze (,rKOrwv): the harpist, poet, historian (ados8d) : the doctor (irWip), and the cup-bearer (who takes the place of Hem. K'pv$). The chief difference between the Celtic and Homeric list (Od. xvii. 383) is that the former contains the professional soldier, who does not seem to have existed in Homeric times: but we have instances of Greeks serving as mer- cenaries (the 10,000) some time before the earliest recorded instance of Celtic mer- cenaries (369 B.C. in Egypt). So Mommsen is not justified in calling the Celts 'die rechten Lanzknechte des alterthums' R.G. i. 8th ed. p. 326. Here the French critic re- minds the learned historian of the German origin of the French lansquenet. A wrong explanation of yacbavroc is given by Polybius, ii. 22, it simply means lance-bearers (Irish gae, spear; Sanscr: hdsas; Xatos). Both Greeks and Celts omit the merchant from their list, and to both 'pirate' implies no dishonour. Chapter III. La Religion. A characteristic feature of the early Celtic character is faith in the power of the magician. For the Celtic magician a simple incantation is suf- ficient to call up the dead; the Homeric hero must go through a far more complicated process. The teaching of the Druids. The anthropomorphism of the Greek and Celt had been preceded by a period of nature- worship: the Irish king Conchobar swears by heaven, earth, and water; so Hera II. xv. 36-38. Relations of gods and men, mortals of divine parentage 2; cf.'AiroXXo-oyhv, 'Ep/oyvrs, Ky4no-oyCv/ with Gaul. Camulo- genos (son of Camulos the Gaulish Mars): ace. to Propertius, v. 10, 41, Virdomarus ' genus hic Rheno iactabat ab ipso.' 3 Gods in the form of birds, cf. Athene as swallow with the Irish war goddess Bodb (raven). The home of the gods. There are two self-contradictory conceptions in Homer (1) 'Oh XvrLa 8Ocar' LXOVrcs, II. i. 18, (2) oaPavrvv EVfPV CXovGLV, II. xx. 299. Of these the second is the oldest. The Irish gods came originally from the sky, and dwelt in Ireland until they were conquered by men, then some left the country and occupied the distant islands of the west,4 others remained hidden in the caves of the land. The Celts do not seem to have been acquainted with the idea of the dead being received in Heaven above or Hades below: they are always sent to the far-off corners of the world (Elysium). When a man dies his life or soul passes into the world of the dead, and there finds a copy of all that is laid in the tomb or burnt on the pyre. This doctrine was carried to its logical con- clusion by the Celt, and even letters 5 could be sent to the deceased by burning the writing on the tomb, and debts6 could be paid in the next world. The Greek concep- tion of the after-life as we have it in Homer is a mixture of contradictory notions; this inconsistency is due to the introduction of foreign ideas borrowed from the Semites, especially the Homeric Hades, that sad and dark country in which the dead are mere shades or rphantoms, and not living bodies as in the Celtic or Sanscrit myth. The 1 Traces of a similar custom may be seen in the Welsh Breudwyt Ronabwy (Red Book, i. p. 146), where it is the man who falls asleep on the skin of a yellow calf who sees the wonderful visions that give their name to the tale, Rhonabwy's Dream; cf. Lady of the Lake, Canto IV. 2 Cf. Achilles, son of a goddess, and his Celtic counter-type Cuchullin, son of the god Lug. There is a very striking resemblance between these two favourite heroes: both excel in bravery, the life of both is brilliant but cut off before its prime. The horse of Achilles possesses the gift of speech, can divine the future, and sheds tears over his master's fate : the horse of Cuchullin foresees coming events, and sheds tears of blood. 3 There is no need, adds our author, for modern editors to change Rheno into Brenno, as we know from inscriptions that the Rhine was worshipped, and a tradition existed that the Rhine was father to a mortal son by a mortal woman; Propertius' author- ity may have been Fabius Pictor, the contemporary of Virdomarus. 4 The Homeric Elysium. Mortals have also reached this happy land, as Bran mac Febal who, in the Irish legend, met on his way the sea-god Manannan mac Lir travelling in a chariot which gently rolled over the crest of the waves. See the Voyage of Branu (Nutt), edited and translated by Kuno Meyer with essay on the 'Happy Other-world,' by Alfred Nutt. 5 Diod. v. 28. 6 Mela, iii. c. 2, ? 19.</page><page sequence="4">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. 331 Celt buries his dead, the Homeric Greek is ,cremated. Of a belief in reward or punish- ment after death there is no trace in Celtic theology. Lucky and unlucky numbers- To the Greek and Celt the right was the lucky side, to the Roman the left, owing to Etruscan influence. Chapter IV. La Famille. The Celtic like the Homeric family is based on the mono- gamic principle. Chapter V. La Guerre. The war-chariot of the Gauls excited considerable comment among the Romans. Among the earliest Gauls and Irish known to us, horsemanship in battle was exceptional; in later times the use of the chariot in war was aban- doned. There is a difference in form between the Celtic and Greek war-chariot, the Homeric warrior has to remain standing, while there is a seat for two in the Celtic chariot in which the warrior sits on the left, the driver on the right. Essedum is really the name of the seat alone (= ex-sedon 'siige extbrieur, si'ge hors de la maison'); [but Stokes is more probably correct, in resolving it into en-sedon, of in-sideo]. Arms of the Celt : defensive, shield: offensive, stones 1 (with or without the use of a sling), spear, sword and club. The other defensive weapons attributed to the Celts by various authorities are of later origin and borrowed from strangers. The use of the bow and arrow was quite unknown to the old Irish and British; the Irish saiged and Welsh saeth are borrowed from sagitta, their word for bow, (Ir. boga, W. bwa) is of Germanic origin. The arms of the Celt are very similar to those of the warriors of Homer, but there is no similarity whatever in their names, while there is a very close resemblance in the names used by the Romans, Germans, and Celts: for instance, none of the numerous Homeric words for ' lance' occur in Celtic: Gaul: gaison, (Ir. gae) = Germ: ger; Ir. sciath (shield) = scutum which can hardly be connected with oK-iros as this is never used by Homer to mean ' the leather of a shield' (wvo'dv) but always in the sense of 'shoe leather' (Od: xiv. 34) : the Gaulish cladebos (Ir. claideb) borrowed by the Romans became gladius; G. carros, (chariot) = currus, Ir: roth (wheel) = rota, and Germ rad; this word occurs in the river-name Rotanos changed by the Greeks of Massilia into Rhodanos owing to the in- fluence of the Homeric line 7rtp 7rora/Lzv KEXadovra, 7 rapL potavOv &amp;ovaK?7a.
