<plain_text><page sequence="1">JEROME J. McGANN The Idea of an Indeterminate Text: Blake's Bible of Hell and Dr. Alexander Geddes In Blake scholarship, one of the most vexing problems involves the variant textual states of several of his works. Among the Illuminated Books, different copies of the Songs of Innocence and of Experience, The [First] Book of Urizen, Milton, and Jerusalem contain different plate se quences which markedly affect the way we will read these works. All such differences are of great interest to Blake scholars, but the most important of them all?because the most problematic?are the variances to be found in and between the texts of Urizen.1 In this particular case, moreover, what appears at first as a local problem for students of Blake, on further investigation begins to reveal connections with much more broadly dispersed issues?issues that bear upon fundamental areas of romantic and post-romantic artistic practice, as well as the ideological context within which those practices emerged and developed. To be specific: Blake's Urizen is the first English poem whose structure was developed in conscious response to the new devel opments in textual studies which we associate with 18th century German scholarship?with classicists like C. G. Heyne and F. A. Wolf, and biblical scholars like J. G. Eichhorn and J. P. Gabler. In this respect, Urizen stands at the head of a line of works which would include "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner," The Giaour, "Sohrab and Rustum," several of Morris's best poems, and?the culminant text?Pound's Can tos. Furthermore, a great many of our most important romantic and post-romantic works deploy layering structures which are clearly in debt i. The information on the variances between and within the different copies of these Blake books, as well as the others discussed in this essay, are supplied in G. E. Bentley Jr.'s Blake Books (Oxford: Clarendon, 1977) and his edition of William Blake's Writings (Oxford: Clarendon, 1978). I have, however, in the case of The [First] Book of Urizen, checked Bentley's descriptions against the facsimile copies of that work available in the Huntington Library.

McGANN to this textual tradition: one thinks immediately of Keats's two "Hy perions," a number of Browning's poems, The Waste Land, and the works of David Jones. That Urizen is a parody of the Book of Genesis is well and widely known. Indeed, many scholars now take it for granted that Urizen is, in the words of G. E. Bentley, Jr., "the first book of'The Bible of Hell' with which Blake threatened the world in the Marriage (?i790-3) pi. 24. . . ."2 Much evidence supports that view. The fact that Blake drafted a title page for his Bible of Hell3 in the mid 1790s shows that his declaration in the Marriage was not simply a satiric gesture. Urizen was initially titled "The First Book of Urizen" in order to emphasize the biblical connection: Genesis is traditionally called "the first book of Moses" or "the first book of the Pentateuch" (the latter, by convention, attributed to Moses's authorship). Furthermore, Blake engraved and printed two more books for his parodie Pentateuch, The Book of Ahania (1795) and The Book of Los (1795). Of all Blake's engraved works, only these three are printed in double columns with divisions into chapters and verses as well. The physical appearance of these three works, that is to say, was intended to recall the typical format of those Bibles of Heaven owned and read by everyone.4 The parodie relation of these three works to the Bible led Northrop Frye to the following remarks in 1947: "The Book of Ahania is a sequel to The Book of Urizen, and The Book of Los intersects The Book of Urizen at its fourth chapter, somewhat as the J and E narratives intertwine in Genesis."5 That general view of the matter remains in force to this day. More particularly, Frye's description of the relation between Los and Urizen, advanced in a metaphor drawn from modern biblical exegesis, has recently been picked up by Leslie Tannenbaum in his Biblical Tra dition in Blake's Early Prophecies: The Great Code of Art. Tannenbaum argues quite straightforwardly that "From these distinctions [between the J and the E strands in Genesis] Blake derives his conception of Urizen and Los."6 And later: "Blake's most immediate source" for "the story of the division of the Elohim and Jehovah . . . and . . . the triumph of 2.

What is problematic in his argument is the suggestion that (a) Blake's "most immediate source" for the distinction between an Elohist and a Jahwist version of Genesis is to be found in Milton, and (b) that Blake's work could have any actual relation to the textual tradition in biblical studies which produced the distinction between J and E strands in the first place. Quite simply, Milton as a source for an Elohist v. Jahwist version of Genesis is im possible, and equally impossible?on the face of it any rate?is the idea that Blake could have had any direct knowledge about J and E strands in the biblical texts. For the idea of "strands" in the biblical texts?that is to say, the now-famous "documentary hypothesis" about the biblical texts?was only first formulated between 1779-1783 by J. G. Eichhorn in two seminal works written in German. They were not translated, and Blake did not know German. All this may seem a mere tempest in the teapot of Blake scholarship, but in fact the problems located here bear upon important and widely dispersed literary issues, as I have already suggested. This is why we must be even more particular about Blake's biblical parody in Urizen. And we can be. We can say, for example, that Blake's critical parody of the Bible is specifically mounted from the vantage of the late Enlight enment revolution in textual studies of the biblical deposits. We can say that Blake probably knew Eichhorn's documentary hypothesis, and we can say further that he did not use it as a model when he fashioned any of the three books of the Bible of Hell. We can go further still and say that Blake's Bible of Hell, and Urizen in particular, has modelled its for mal procedures on a theory of the biblical texts which was the chief rival, in Blake's period, to Eichhorn's now more celebrated documentary hy pothesis. Indeed, the more one studies the textual problems of Urizen in this larger textual context, the more one realizes that Urizen (as well as its two associated "biblical" texts, Ahania and Los) reflects the influence of the new biblical scholarship precisely in those bibliographical aspects of its text which have caused so much trouble for readers of Blake. As we shall see shortly, we can even be reasonably confident in identi fying the chief conduit for Blake's knowledge of the new biblical schol arship.

Geddes was one of the two biblical critics of the period who developed?as an alternative to Eichhorn's documentary hypoth esis?the theory of biblical texts known as the "fragment hypothesis."8 II We begin to unravel this complex of issues by recapitulating the prob lems in the texts of Urizen. This matter is best approached, initially, by comparing Urizen with Blake's other illuminated writings. Except for the various copies of the Songs?a work which is, in any case, an anthology or collection of pieces, and hence without narrative aspirations as such?none of Blake's other illuminated books exhibits the variances in ordering that we find in Urizen. Comparisons with those works most closely associated with it, The Book of Ahania and The Book of Los, are not useful since the latter works only survive in unique copies. The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, on the other hand, a tangentially related work, does have a loose narrativized structure, yet it preserves the order of its plates in almost all copies that survive. Similarly, though Milton and Jerusalem show certain alterations in the plate sequencing, these variances?particularly in works of such length and narrative complex ity?are less consequential than are the variances in Urizen. Indeed, disorder both within and between the various copies of the latter seems almost the rule which Blake followed when he put the work together. Or rather, disorder is a permanent presence with which the work's conventional narrative inertia seems always to be engaged.9 The ordering problem in Urizen is basically twofold. First, certain plates which appear in some copies are absent from others. In some cases the missing plates contain only illustrative material, but in several others they contain important verbal material as well. A variant of this problem involves plates 7-8, which are absent in one copy (C). These plates seem to contain redundant material?that is, an "extra" passage headed by Blake "Chap, iv." Thus, in this case the six copies containing plates 7-8 have two chapters four, as if Blake had neglected to choose between the two and thus left most of the copies of Urizen with an 8. My essay draws upon two works for its details about Geddes' life: Reginald Cuthbert Fuller, Dr. Alexander Geddes: A Forerunner of Biblical Criticism 2 Vols. Ph. D. Thesis, Cambridge University, 1968; J. M. Good, Memoirs of the Life and Writings of the Reverend Alexander Geddes LL.D. (London: G. Kearsley, 1803). 9.

GEDDES 307 unnecessary accretion. Later editions of Blake produced by scholars, by refusing to delete either of the two chapters four, have established the problem on a permanent basis. Other missing plates include plate 4 (not in copies D-G), plates 9 and 24 (not in copy E), and plate 16 (not in C F). The second problem involves the ordering of the plates in the indi vidual copies. In this case the anomaly is itself of two kinds. On the one hand, none of the plate orderings in any of the copies of Urizen provides a narrative continuity which scholars have found acceptable. Each copy has certain plate sequencing problems which disturb the internal consis tency of the material. Furthermore, no two copies ever agree on any one sequence. We see this immediately in Bentley's tabular description of the binding order of the seven copies: Copy Binding-order A 1-2, 22, 24, 3-4, 12, 5-7, 17, 8, 10-11, 14, 13, 18, 21, 19, 15-16, 20, 9, 23, 26, 25, 28, 27 B 1-4, 14, 5-7, 10, 12, 8, 11, 22, 13, 9, 15-16, 18, 17, 19, 24, 20-1, 23, 25-8 C 1, 2, 2-4, 12, 5-6, 9-11, 13, 22, 15, 14, 18, 17, 19, 21, 20, 23, 27, 24-6, 28 D 1-3, 5-15, 17-28 E 1, 3, 5, 12, 2, 6, 14, 7, 10, 8, 11, 22, 13, 15, 18, 17, 19, 25, 20-1, 23, 26-8 F 1-3, 5, 12, 6-7, 14, 10, 8-9, 11, 13, 22, 15, 18, 17, 19-21, 23-8 G 1-3, 9, 5, 12, 6, 14, 7-8, 22, 10-11, 16, 13, 15, 17-21, 23, 27, 24-6, 28 H-I Loose10 As Bentley observes, "The problem of arranging the plates is confusing, for each of the seven copies is bound quite differently from the others, and three of these orders [i.e., copies B, D, G] are justified by Blake's foliation."11 Like other scholars, however, Bentley thinks that "if we separate the plates bearing text from those consisting only of designs, the patterns become clearer."12 This is certainly true, but equally certain is the fact that serious ordering problems remain. In plates 1-11, for example, the extant copies offer four distinct sequences for the verbal text: 1-4, 5-7, io. Bentley, Writings i: 715. 11. Writings i: 715. 12. Writings i: 715.</page><page sequence="6">308 JEROME J. McGANN 8, io-ii (copy A); 1-4, 5-7, 10, 8, 11 (copy B); 1-3, 5-7, 10, 8, 11 (copies E, F); 1-3, 5-7, 8, 10, 11 (copies D, G). And of course ?jopy C has its own special sequence due to the absence of plates 7-8 (1-4, 5-6, io-ii). Notable here is that in Blake's own foliated copies two different sequences are provided. Only slightly less troubling is the fact that copy A has the following sequence later in the poem for the verbal text (13, 18, 19, 15, 20) where all the other copies have 13, 15, 18-20. In face of these kinds of textual problems Blake's best editors have striven to find an authoritative order. Bentley says that "Despite the extraordinary inconsistency of the orders in which copies are numbered and bound, the proper arrangement of the text is fairly plain": 1-4, 12, 5?11, 13-28. This is, he notes, an "eclectic" text which corresponds "most closely to the numbered copy D" but which is in fact "chiefly based upon narrative consistency, foliation, binding, and the relationship of design of text."13 Erdman's approach and general view is the same: "There is only one possible arrangement of the text, since it is organized into numbered chapters?except that Plate 8, duplicating the numbers of Plate 10, was probably meant to replace it. Yet Plate 2 is out of order in copy E, 15 follows 18 in copy A, and 8 follows rather than precedes 10 in copies B, E, and F."14 Erdman's "one possible arrangement" for the verbal text is the same as Bentley 's. Now there is no question but that, from the point of view of narrative consistency, Bentley and Erdman are correct to think that their ordering preference is the most reasonable. Yet neither editor is willing to pursue their quest for narrative consistency far enough so as to remove one or another of the duplicate chapters 4. Furthermore, all later editions en shrine the problem of this unstable text in that curious title?so difficult to read aloud?with the bracketed word: The [First] Book of Urizen. Scholars can neither wholly give up nor entirely accept that problematic word preserved in most copies of the work but erased by Blake in others.15 Thus a residue of the text's "extraordinary inconsistency" al ways remains a dramatic presence in our received and scholarly editions. In the various facsimile editions the textual irregularities are especially prominent. Of course, many readers of Blake would regard these kinds of schol arly preoccupations with the "correct" order as profoundly anti-Blakean 13- Writings i: 716-17. 14.

GEDDES 309 operations?a kind of quest for, as it were, a textual "solid without fluctuation" (Plate 4:10) All readers of Blake are aware that his is a prolific and not a devouring art?an art whose chief aim is to "rouze the faculties to act."16 Reasonable orders are not imaginative orders. Erdman's awareness of this general truth about Blake's work, for ex ample, leads him to the following conclusion about the Songs of Innocence and of Experience. Since the arrangement of the poems in this work differs markedly among the 21 surviving copies, Erdman suggests "that the reader experiment, as Blake did, to find what different tensions and resonances are produced by different juxtapositions."17 That suggestion has subsequently been taken by many critics as a guiding principle for reading all of Blake's works. Urizen will yield to such a principle very nicely. What I want to suggest here, however, is that Urizen s unstable text is of a determinate type, and that it owes its imaginative conception to Blake's discovery, in the early 1790s, of the new scholarly investigations into the state of the biblical texts. Ill Biblical scholars from antiquity have been aware of various textual anomalies in both the Old and the New Testaments. Not until the 18th century, however, were systematic methods found for clarifying (if not unravelling) the many problems of those texts. This came about largely as a consequence of the application to biblical studies of the recent advances made in the elucidation of similar problems relating to classical texts. The single most important figure among the classicists was Heyne, for it was Heyne who led directly to Eichhorn, and from Eichhorn came Gabler. With Gabler's revised edition of Eichhorn's Urgeschicte, Ein Ver such, originally published in 1779, but reissued in 1790-93 in Gabler's enormously augmented work, the new biblical scholarship was estab lished on a firm and clear foundation. Blake, of course, did not read any of this German work directly. What he would have read was the work of Dr. Alexander Geddes, one of Joseph Johnson's authors and a man who moved in the same circles with Blake in the early 1790s. Geddes was the chief conduit in England for the ideas which were being pursued and elaborated by the new German scholars of the Bible. In addition, Blake seems to have also been familiar with the numerous discussions of the new biblical criticism which ap 16. Poetry and Prose 676. 17. Poetry and Prose 714.</page><page sequence="8">310 JEROME J. McGANN peared in the most important periodical associated with Johnson's circle, the Analytical Review. Indeed, in the years 1788-91 Geddes was Johnson's principal reviewer of this material, which included all of the leading works being produced in Germany by scholars like J. D. Michaelis and Eichhorn.18 So far as the structural problems associated with Blake's Bible of Hell are concerned, Geddes is important because he provided Blake with certain crucial insights into the character of the biblical texts. Geddes' textual ideas developed out of his original encounter with the new biblical studies being pursued in Germany. This scholarship, which effected a revolution in biblical studies, was neither well nor widely received in England at the time. In so far as it was known at all it was viewed with suspicion, and Geddes was consequently the object of sharp attack as one whose work was undermining the basis of England's ideological order. This field of dispute is the context within which I will pursue the textual problems in the Bible of Hell. Before considering the specific instabilities we have already observed in Blake's works, however, I shall have to make an excursus into the question of Blake's ideas about myth. This move is necessary for two reasons. First, Geddes, like his counter parts in Germany, developed his ideas about the biblical texts via a set of critical reflections in comparative mythography. Consequently, Geddes textual ideas with respect to the Bible are not easily separated from his ideas about myth, and the same is true of Blake. Second, received scholarly opinion on Blake's ideas about myth is seriously deficient in several crucial areas, and this deficiency needs to be rectified. Geddes first became involved in translating the Bible in connection with the project of his patron, the Roman Catholic Lord Petre, who wanted to provide English Catholics with a revision of the Douai and Challoner Bibles. When this plan was pre-empted by the Catholic bish ops, who were wary that the work of the young priest might prove too liberal, Geddes decided to undertake his translation as an independent scholarly task. He first announced the method and goal of this work in his Prospectus of a New Translation of the Holy Bible (1786). This work argued that the received biblical texts were corrupt because they all derived from unreliable base texts?indeed, the problems arose because of a failure to understand the historical character of the base texts. Geddes maintained that the foundational Hebrew text, the Masoretic Bible, was a heteroglot work and hence did not reflect some original and pure i8. Good (192-94) gives a schedule of Geddes' reviews in the Analytical; they began in 1788 and ended in 1793.</page><page sequence="9">BLAKE'S BIBLE OF HELL AND DR. GEDDES 311 inspiration. The other early texts, the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate, were obviously secondary and equally in need of critical ex amination. A "New Translation" could only be produced, then, by returning to the original Hebrew documents, which would have to be critically examined and purified. In Geddes' view this meant?so far as the Pentateuch was concerned?returning to the Samaritan Pentateuch as "a far more faithful representative of the prototype than any masoretic copy at this day extant."19 Geddes' Prospectus was noticed principally by scholars, who took exception to his work in several ways. But the larger ideological issues concealed in the technical disputes did not pass without comment, so that Geddes was induced to bring out three more pamphlets?in 1787, 1788, and 1790?responding to the criticisms which were raised against his plans. These criticisms came both from establishment Protestant quarters?who looked warily on any suggestion that the received Bible might be textually unreliable?and from Geddes' own Roman Catholics, who were institutionally committed to the authority of the Latin Vul gate. When the first volume of Geddes' Bible finally appeared in June, 1792, it was variously hailed and denounced.20 The Roman Catholic bishop of London condemned the work and suspended Geddes from the exer cise of his priestly functions. The notices in the more liberal press, like the Critical Review and the Monthly Review, were favorable, but the conservative (and Protestant) British Critic followed the bishop of Lon don in condemning the work as "dangerous" and "insidious." Geddes responded to his critics in two further pamphlets published in 1793 and 1794. In 1797 the second volume of Geddes' Bible finally appeared, and the third volume?containing Geddes Critical Remarks on the first two volumes of his translation?was issued in 1800. Geddes died in 1801. IV Geddes was a highly visible and active advocate of the most liberal ideas of the period. His Bible was a work of the English Left, and was recognized as such at the time. This is important to remember when we reflect upon Geddes' influence upon Blake's Urizen and the whole project of a Bible of Hell. Such a project all but declared its association with the advanced Enlightenment traditions of biblical scholarship, which were seen at the time?in conservative quarters?as destructive of the 19- Prospectus of a New Translation of the Holy Bible 19. 20. See Fuller, especially 187-92, for a discussion of the early responses to Geddes' work.</page><page sequence="10">312 JEROME J. McGANN foundations of religion. But neither Geddes nor Blake saw their own work in this way?on the contrary, in fact. Both conceived that their work would set Christianity on a deeper and more firm footing. Two lines of Geddes' thinking on biblical matters were important for Blake, both in general, and in relation to Blake's Bible of Hell particu larly. The first of these I have already touched upon. That is to say, Blake's ideas about myth coincide with, and in certain respects even derive from, the new classical and biblical hermeneu tics. Since Blake did not read German, and would not have had direct access to the works of the new German scholarship, his connection to this material requires explanation. The crucial point of intersection between Blake's early work and Geddes' research?the reason why Blake would have been initially drawn to Geddes' biblical studies?lies in each man's ideas about mythology. Both Geddes and Blake were syncretic mythographers. That is to say, they both believed that ancient texts (like Homer, the Bible, or early national scriptures such as the Icelandic Eddas) employed com parable modes of discourse: for the syncretists, [all] gods and fables . . . were variants of an archetypal pattern of history and/or religion. In the hands of ortho dox theologians like [Jacob] Bryant . . . such syncretism could demonstrate that myths were derivative of certain primary Christian myths and hence the truths of Christianity were affirmed; while on the other hand such skeptics as Drummond and Dupuis could syncretize all myths and assert that Christian ones had no more priority to truth than pagan ones since both proceeded from natur alistic archetypal symbols in primitive thought and imagination.21 Blake scholars still follow Ruthven Todd's view that Blake's ideas about myth coincide fairly closely with those of Bryant. And while there is no reason to question the pertinence of Bryant's work to Blake's, the connection is not nearly so central as Todd thought. The key Blakean idea in the 1790s22?that "All Bibles or sacred codes" (The Marriage of Heaven and Hell Plate 4: 1) contain ideologically skewed poetic materials, or "forms of worship" fashioned out of "poetic tales" (Marriage Plate 11)?is not derivable from mythographers like Bryant. 21.

His negative attitude toward pagan mythographic materials, and his apparent privileging of the Christian corpus, are not characteristic of the 1790s.</page><page sequence="11">BLAKE'S BIBLE OF HELL AND DR. GEDDES 313 To such readers, the Bible was a special case and in no way comparable to the ancient pagan mythological texts. Bryant, for example, made the biblical "history" into a set of factual truths which were then obscurely reflected in, and corroborated by, various coincident pagan texts. But Blake's idea, first fully elaborated in the Marriage (especially in plates 11-13), was that all the ancient texts, biblical and pagan alike, contained what Blake's contemporaries called "mythologues"?that is, "poetic tales" which encoded various culturally specific ideas and attitudes. In other words, Blake read the Bible in the same way that he read any other ancient text. In this respect his method of reading recalls Enlight enment figures like Bayle, Dupuis, and even Paine. Nicholas Bonne ville's De l'Esprit des Religions (1792) is a work very much in that line of "skeptical" (so-called) mythography.23 It was reviewed in Johnson's Analytical Review, and the phrasing of this notice distinctly recalls Blake's Marriage Plates 11-13: Every thing of old became animated in the opinion of a people, who consulted nothing but their senses . . .; they accordingly not only imagined, that men like themselves, and the animals that surrounded them, were thinking creatures, but also that the sun, the moon, the rivers, and the plants were so also. The style became dramatic, and the stars and the flowers were described as men. . . ,24 Blake read the primitive parts of the Bible in the light of a similar anthropomorphic theory. So far as he was concerned, what distinguished the Bible from the ancient pagan texts was the New Testament, which provided the reader of the Old Testament (and of the equivalent ancient pagan texts) with a deconstructive key for elucidating all received scrip ture. This way of reading the texts of Holy Scripture, and especially the Old Testament texts, came to Blake through the work of men like Bishop Lowth, whose Lectures were first translated into English in 1787. But the approach as it is employed by Blake?particularly between 1790 1798?carries a critical edge which one does not find in Lowth, and which one associates with the "skeptical" and Enlightenment tradition of mythography. The Marriage and the whole project of a Bible of Hell, after all, assume a fundamentally satiric and critical posture. In this context, the new German textual scholarship as that was mediated for 23. In a letter to me Robert Essick noted several other parallel texts for the Marriage Plate ii. The most interesting of these is a passage from William Stukeley's Stonehenge (London, 1740) 59. 24. Analytical Review 18 [April 1794]: 401.</page><page sequence="12">314 JEROME J. McGANN Blake by Gc ddes would have supplied the poet with a point of view which coincided, in many respects, with his own. So far as the status of fable and myth is concerned, an alternative can be marked out between the orthodox position (Bryant) and the skeptical (Bayle, Bonneville, Dupuis). Both Blake and Geddes occupied that position in slightly different ways.25 Unlike Bryant, Blake did not see the biblical texts as more privileged than other comparably primitive documents from different cultures. A case could be made out that Blake's views changed slightly sometime after 1800. Before that date, however, his position does not vary from what we find in the Marriage and, earlier, in All Religions are One: Principle 5. The Religeons of all Nations are derived from each Nation's different reception of the Poetic Genius which is every where call'd the Spirit of Prophecy. Principle 6 The Jewish &amp; Christian Testaments are An original derivation from the Poetic Genius, this is necessary from the confined nature of bodily sensation Principle 7th As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various) So all Religions &amp; as all similars have one source. The true Man is the source he being the Poetic Genius.26 Blake's position here is a gnostic one, and it conforms to certain Neo Platonic structures of thought, as Kathleen Raine has shown. Todd's remark that in Blake we find "the nitric acid of Boehme applied to the copper plate of Bryant" is a peculiarly apt formulation.27 What Todd and Raine do not see, however, is that Blake's view of "All Bibles or sacred codes" put him in a position that would be espe cially sympathetic to the new biblical scholarship as set out for English audiences in the work of Geddes and the Analytical Review. Though a romantic in many cultural respects, Blake was?like most of the ro mantics?deeply marked by certain Enlightenment modes of thought. Thus, Blake's frequent attacks upon priestcraft are entirely coincident with the most radical lines of Enlightenment thinking. The idea that 2$. Frye (chap, i) and Peter Fisher (The Valley of Vision. Blake as Poet and Revolutionary [Toronto: U of Toronto P, 1961], chap. 4) present what has since become the dominant view?that Blake's work is a "visionary" response to the Enlightenment. But Blake's stance toward the 18th century was hostile to Reason as the norm of the human; he was not hostile to the Enlightenment's critical and emancipatory programs. 26. Poetry and Prose 2-3. 27.

Similarly, though critical of Paine in certain respects, Blake stood with him against Bishop Watson on the matter of how one should read the Bible. In this case the relevance to Geddes is quite interesting. To Blake, "Paine has not attacked Christianity. Watson has defended Antichrist. "28 Watson's attack on Paine's critique of the Bible is "wicked &amp; blasphe mous" in Blake's eyes in two principal respects: first, Watson denies both that conscience is the ultimate standard of judgment and that "honest indignation" is the mark of Poetic Genius; and second, Watson defends every word and deed in the Bible as a record of divine provi dence. But to Blake "Conscience ... is unequivocal, it is the voice of God. "29 Paine, therefore, is an oracle of conscience, one of those "who give themselves to their Energetic Genius" rather than one of those, like Watson, who "pretend to be a modest Enquirer" into the Bible but who are in fact hypocrites and defenders of state religion.30 Similarly, Blake dismisses Watson's traditional ideas about the status of the biblical record: To me who believe the Bible &amp; profess myself a Christian a defence of the Wickedness of the Israelites in murdering so many thousands under pretence of a command from God is altogether Abominable &amp; Blasphemous Was not Christ murderd because he taught that God loved all Men &amp; was their father &amp; forbad all contention for Worldly prosperity in opposition to the Jewish Scriptures which are only an Example of the wickedness &amp; deceit of the Jews. . . . Christ died an Unbeliever. &amp; . . . the Holy Ghost ... in Paine strives with Christendom as in Christ he strove with the Jews.31 To Blake, if the Bible is not read out of "Conscience or the Word of God Universal"32 it will be read out of a narrow ideology, or what he calls "state religion." The Bible must be read critically and not in terms of its own self-conceptions, moral codes, or forms of worship. This is why Blake, once again echoing his earlier thought in the Marriage, says: "That the Jews assumed a right (Exclusively) to the benefits of God. 28. Poetry and Prose 601. 29.

McGANN will be a lasting witness against them. &amp; the same will be against Christians."33 This way of reading the text of Holy Scripture, and especially the Old Testament texts, sets Blake alongside the more scholarly procedures of Geddes. Blake's unswerving view that "The Holy Bible &amp; the Gospel of Jesus are not allegory"34 and must not be read allegorically recalls Geddes' own firm conviction that any allegorical elements in the biblical texts are not a part of their originary character but have been interpolated and insinuated by later editors and commentators. Geddes' quest for what he calls "the bare literal meaning"35 is entirely equivalent to Blake's project, set out in the Marriage, of revealing the infinite that is hidden beneath the obscured surfaces of all texts.36 Similarly, Blake would have been impressed with all of Geddes's writings, as he was impressed with Paine, because they exhibited a candid and total adherence to intellectual honesty. Thus, Geddes' response to his critics in his 1793 pamphlet is entirely characteristic. "I am," he states, "a sworn enemy to implicit faith, as well as to implicit obedience [and] have ever been accustomed to think for myself. . . and . . . will speak and write as I think. "37 These coincidences between Blake and Geddes should not be partic ularly surprising since the two men moved together in the same radical circles. To this point, however, only one critic has noticed a specific connection between Geddes and a text by Blake, and in this instance no general conclusions are suggested. Against the background I have been sketching, however, we may further distinguish the two points of con tact which throw significant new light on Blake's work. F. B. Curtis found in Urizen an echo of the Preface to Geddes' translation of the Bible,38 and several other local points of intersection might be reasonably argued. The correlations are especially noticeable, however, in the area of Blake's and Geddes' ideas about myth. Previous critics have seen in these ideas the influence of Bryant's deluvian thesis, 33- Poetry and Prose 605. 34. Poetry and Prose 544. 35. Dr. Geddes' Address to the Public on the publication of the First Volume of his Translation of the Bible (London, 1793) 2. 36. Blake and Geddes are not deploying an allegorical structure here but an anti allegorical one. The cleansing of the surface removes the overlay of priestly meanings ("forms of worship") in order to reveal the clear text ("poetic tales"). Like Geddes, Blake's is essentially a bibliographical rather than an allegorical operation. Blake's hostility to allegory is, of course, well known: see in particular Blake's Vision of the Last Judgment. 37. Dr. Geddes' Address . . . (1793) 1. 38. F. B.

GEDDES 317 and while a connection to Bryant must not be dismissed, we should see that Blake's thought runs on a longer and far more significant parallel with Geddes. For example, Blake's notion that the natural world of the earth is the creation of a fallen deity, and that it is all a "watry shore" and a "starry floor, " distinctly recalls Geddes ideas about the condition of the world before the events described in Genesis. The first five plates of Urizen do not correspond to anything in Genesis; rather, they depict the state of affairs just before the events recorded at the beginning of Genesis? which is to say a psycho-political, or ideological state of affairs that stand as the background for the subsequent acts of "creation" carried out, in Blake's translation of these events, by Urizen and then by Los. The Genesis account, for Blake, does not give us a true picture of a divinely created world (that is to say, an Original Existence); rather, its record preserves only a broken set of images. The beginning of Urizen, then, depicts a Urizenic view of existence, and Blake seems to have found his model for this scene in Geddes' Bible. According to Geddes, before the "creation" began in Genesis 1:3 the stellar universe was already in place, and the earth was "formed out of water and by means of water."39 This is the equivalent of the state of existence conjured in the fearful and deranged imagination of Urizen as he is separating himself from Eternity. It is what Blake will later see as the world of Ulro. Geddes describes it this way: Could there, indeed, be conceived a more desolate and dismal situation than that in which our little planet was then plunged? A mass of unformed matter, totally immersed in water, and sur rounded with a dense, dark, tempestuous air!?Well, what must be done? This dark mass of earth and water must be enlightened. . . .40 At this point the Genesis account takes over with the creation of light in the form of the sun: the sun, could not . . . illuminate more than half the earth at once . . . and this is fitly called separating the light from the darkness; namely, by that ever-flitting boundary called by us the horizon.41 Geddes' footnote to this passage and to the word horizon is as close as we are likely to come to the point of origin of his own [First] Book of Urizen: "From a Greek word . . . which signifies to bound or terminate." 39- Geddes, Holy Bible iii. 40. Geddes, Holy Bible iv. 41. Geddes, Holy Bible iv.</page><page sequence="16">318 JEROME J. McGANN Most Blake scholars now agree that the name Urizen derives from the Greek word which Geddes noted, but no one has suggested what may have stimulated Blake to his play upon the Greek. That it was Geddes who provided Blake with the local habitation and the name for his own parodie book of Genesis is not important simply as a philological fact. Its significance lies in the total context of relation ships which the Geddes-Blake connection opens up for us. In the present instance, Blake's Urizen follows Geddes' idea, which he shared with the leading contemporary German scholars, that Genesis represents an edited collection of mythological narratives which have their basis in the cul tural history of the ancient Hebrews. The whole account of the Fall, Geddes later remarks in the Preface to his Bible, is actually "an excellent mythologue"42 reflecting the ideas of primitive Judaism. His discussion of "the Mosaic divinity"?the figure Blake will name, recollecting Geddes, Urizen?is particularly apposite in relation to Blake's various accounts of this being. Although possessed of "various positive and absolute attributes," Geddes observes, these are always clothed in colours that inspire rather fear than love: the empire of this latter was, long after, to be established, by a greater lawgiver than Moses. The God of Moses is ?jealous God, who punisheth the iniquity of the fathers in their children, unto the third or fourth generation-, an irascible and avenging God, who consumeth like a devouring fire; who maketh his arrows drunk with the blood of his enemies, and his sword satiated with their flesh. He is even said to harden, sometimes, the hearts of wicked men, that he may take more flagrant vengeance of them. Indeed, the whole tenor of the Pentateuch convinces me, that the more ancient Hebrews were real anthropomorphites. At any rate, all such expressions must be considered as metaphorical im agery, adapted to the ideas of a stupid, carnal people. . . .43 This god is the being Blake names Urizen, the god of boundaries and moral codes. He is to be distinguished from Los, the god of sex and pity, the god who creates the body of Urizen and who is also associated with the creation of Adam and Eve (rather than the creation of the "World") and with the Los(s) of paradise. These two gods represent different (mythologized) perspectives, and as such they epitomize the idea that everything is as it is ideologically perceived. Ahania, Ore, Fuzon, and all of Blake's odd assortment of 42. Geddes, Holy Bible xi. 43. Geddes, Holy Bible xii.</page><page sequence="17">BLAKE'S BIBLE OF HELL AND DR. GEDDES 319 mythic figures locate special points of vision. Geddes was not especially important in helping Blake clarify his own views on these matters. But Geddes' mythological conception of the ancient Hebrew texts operated with another set of ideas about those texts which did have a profound effect on Blake's management of the structure of Urizen and the entire Bible of Hell project. This second set of ideas in the Geddes Bible is at least as important as Geddes' Enlightenment theory of myth. That is to say, Geddes was Blake's chief source for his knowledge of the state of the biblical texts. So far as our understanding of the The [First] Book of Urizen is concerned, these textual insights are extremely important, and, once again, they have hitherto gone completely unnoticed. V Reading Geddes, Blake would have discovered that the biblical texts did not comprise a seamless narrative marked by occasional ruptures and mistakes. Of course, the hiatuses, corruptions, oddly repeated passages and stories had been well known to scholarship for centuries. Spinoza's disparaging comments on the state of the biblical texts dramatize the problem which the scriptural scholar had to face: If anyone pays attention to the way in which all the histories and precepts in [the Pentateuch] are set down promiscuously and with out order, with no regard for dates; and further, how the same story is often repeated, sometimes in a different version, he will easily, I say, discern that all the materials were promiscuously col lected and heaped together, in order that they might at some sub sequent time be more readily examined and reduced to order. Not only these five books, but also the narratives contained in the remaining seven, going down to the destruction of the city, are compiled in the same way.44 Spinoza set forth, in his Theologico-Political Treatise, a set of rational procedures for negotiating this difficult territory. But he lacked the philological tools?both ethnographic and textual?which would be de veloped later in the Higher Criticism. What the new German scholarship of Eichhorn and Gabler provided was a coherent and totalized theory for explaining these problems. Geddes developed his own special version ofthat theory which later became known as "the fragment hypothesis." In his Preface to the first volume of his Bible translation Geddes, like 44- The Chief Works of Benedict de Spinoza, ed. R. H. M. Elwes (New York: Dover, 1955) 1: 135</page><page sequence="18">320 JEROME J. McGANN his German counterparts, operated on two related principles: that the texts of Holy Writ had to be examined in the light of human reason since they were, fundamentally, human documents; and second, that the texts had to be studied in the sociohistorical context of their institution, both original and transmissive. In adopting this approach, these scholars were essentially following the track first cleared by Spinoza. Thus, when Geddes notes that the division of the Bible into chapters and verses is often done arbitrarily, and just as often obscures the actual makeup of the book, he appeals to facts which scholars like Spinoza had already called attention to many times. Likewise, Spinoza did not fail to point out the numerous contradictions between different texts in the Bible, and the just as frequent repetitions of various stories and passages. For Spinoza, however, clarification of these problems in the "contents of Scripture, must be sought from Scripture alone."45 Furthermore, Spi noza took it for granted that the bible, being under divine authority, "teaches true moral doctrines":46 that is, "true" by the standards which reason can apply. The new element in Geddes' Enlightenment scholarship is the argu ment that the text before us now can only be understood if we step outside the text and examine it in the light of the historical, linguistic, and ethnographic frameworks within which it defines its special, even unique, character. The Bible is a particular example of a general case that can and must be applied to all textual deposits which descend to us over long periods of time. The Bible is the product of a long history, and the application of a scientific method can elucidate the layers and stages ofthat history as they are reflected in the received texts. Spinoza's promiscuous heap was not achieved in one place or time, it is the product of a complex, continuous, and often arbitrary set of historical interac tions. In the Preface to his translation of the Bible Geddes outlines Eichhorn's so-called "documentary" theory of the biblical texts as originally set forth in both the Urgeschichte (1779) and the Einleitung in das Alte Testa mente (1780-83). This theory is the now widely accepted one which holds?for example, in the case of Genesis?that in its most primitive state it comprised two separate written documents (the so-called J and E strands) which were redacted together. A third document (the P strand), according to Eichhorn, was then interpolated at various points into this redaction. Genesis is, then, in this view, a layered text made up of at least three different textual strands that correspond to two 45- Spinoza i: ioo. 46. Spinoza 1: 100.</page><page sequence="19">BLAKE'S BIBLE OF HELL AND DR. GEDDES 321 original and relatively coherent documents along with a third whose character was less precisely determinable. The philological, cultural, and historical differences between these strands are the original source of the Bible's textual problems. Sometimes the different documents have not been woven together very well, sometimes they offer different versions of the same material, and sometimes the editors of the original texts were unable to understand the documents they had to deal with. The Pentateuch for example, traditionally ascribed to the authorship of Moses, is in fact something else altogether?a compiled text put together at different times and which has not come down to us in its full integrity, nor without alterna tions: but what work of antiquity has not had a similar fate? . . . Two rival peoples, the Jews and the Samaritans, have preserved separate exemplars of it, in different characters. It was excellently translated into Greek, at a period when the copies must have been much less imperfect than they afterwards became: this translation we have entire, though not uncorrupted. We have also fragments of three other Greek versions, all prior to the commencement of the third century. We have a Chaldee version, and a Chaldee par aphrase, of uncertain date. We have a Syriac translation. ... In the fourth century we have a Latin version by St. Jerom[e]. . . .47 Geddes' argument is that the biblical compilation is not so uniformly layered as the Eichhorn theory suggested. According to Geddes' Frag ment Hypothesis, the Bible comprised a heterogeneous collection of various materials gathered together at different times by different editors and redactors. As for the Pentateuch, it was not written or compiled by Moses but was "reduced to its present form in the reign of Solomon." It was a compilation from ancient documents, some of which were coeval with Moses, and some even anterior to Moses. Whether all these were written records, or many of them only oral traditions, it would be rash to determine. It is my opinion that the Hebrews had no written doc uments before the days of Moses. . . . [0]ral testimony was trans mitted, from generation to generation, in simple narratives, or rustic songs.48 47- Geddes, Holy Bible xx. 48. Geddes, Holy Bible xix.</page><page sequence="20">322 JEROME J. McGANN Thus, like his contemporary J. S. Vater, who also subscribed to a fragment theory of the biblical texts,49 Geddes saw in the book a great many fragments of different ancient texts?texts of varying length, origin, date, and textual integrity. According to the Fragment Hypoth esis, the Bible is a more disorderly text than the work hypothesized by scholars like Eichhorn, and a far more disorderly text than most ordinary readers would have been able to imagine. Among scholars of the period, Geddes' work was taken seriously and widely discussed. Eichhorn and Geddes engaged in a long correspon dence in which they each compared and tested with the other their views on these questions. To Eichhorn, Geddes' biblical project was an im portant event in the new investigation of the ancient texts. But in England, and among a population?including the learned community? which remained committed to the most traditional types of biblical study, the situation was very different. To produce a Bible on the hermeneutic premises of Geddes' work (mythic material, fragmentary texts), particularly in the volatile period of the 1790s, was a "dangerous" and "impious" exercise, and Geddes felt the full force of Reaction to his work. It was, both politically and theologically, a veritable "Bible of Hell." VI Having laid out the context within which Blake's Urizen was produced, we are now prepared to consider directly the problem of its textual disorderliness. The influence of Geddes' Fragment Hypothesis on Blake's Urizen is most dramatically evident in the poem's two most important textual cruces: that is to say, in relation to the problem of Plate 4, which is missing from four copies, including two of the three which Blake foliated himself; and in relation to plates 7-8, which are present in six of the seven copies, but which contain the redundant chapter 4. Recently Robert Essick has developed an explanation for the absence of Plate 4 from Copy G, the latest of the seven copies.50 His argument rests upon an unexamined piece of documentary material?a loose copy of Plate 4 which was probably printed for Copy G and which shows an improperly aligned plate image. Essick's argument is that the misalign ment of the plate during printing resulted in a bad copy of Plate 4. He further hypothesizes that Blake must not have been able to print off another copy?for reasons unknown to us?and that he may not have 49- See Johann Severin Vater, Commentar ?ber den Pentateuch... 3 Theile (Halle, 1802-5). 50. "Variation, Accident, and Intention in William Blake's The Book of Urizen," Studies in Bibliography 39 (1986): 230-35.</page><page sequence="21">BLAKE'S BIBLE OF HELL AND DR. GEDDES 323 been able to correct the misalignment because he had already decided on the trim-size of Copy G. Essick's is an interesting argument which bears upon Blake's work in an important general way. Even if his hypothesis about Copy G is correct, however, it does not explain the state of the copies of Urizen produced in the 1790s, when the influence of Geddes' work would have been strongest. Nor does it explain the problem of the redundant chapter 4 on plates 7-8, still present in Copy G. But when we reflect that Urizen was conceived as the "First" book in Blake's projected Bible of Hell, and that the textual problems of Plates 4 and 7-8 recall the same sorts of problem which men like Geddes were laboring to clarify for the Bible (of Heaven), the true significance of Blake's disorderly text begins to emerge. These passages do not locate authorial lapses or errors or un resolved incoherences, they represent deliberate acts on Blake's part, textualizations which make Urizen a parody of Genesis carried out along lines opened up by the new biblical criticism and by the radical priest Alexander Geddes in particular. The fact that Blake's ideas about myth? initially developed in the Marriage, but carried forward in Urizen and his later works as well?also correspond to Geddes' thinking is surely no mere coincidence. Add to this the fact that Blake and Geddes moved in the same circles, that they were both devoted students of the Bible and committed to latitudinarian?if not radical?principles in religion and politics, and the correspondences between Urizen and Geddes' ideas become impossible to set aside. Copies of Urizen which lack Plate 4 do not have a chapter 3 in their text, whereas the copies which have Plates 7-8 have an extra chapter 4. Furthermore, three different orderings of the textual materials in Plates 13-20 are extant in the different copies, as we have already seen, and the different copies exhibit all kinds of other, less dramatic discontinu ities. Geddes' work showed Blake, however, not only that many texts of the Bible of Heaven existed, but also that those texts exhibited lacunae and redundancies within and between themselves. Geddes' investigations licensed Blake to deal with his own works quite freely, and they gave him a model for making a parody Bible which would expose and explain the deceptive transparencies and stabilities of the received Bible of Heaven. Blake eventually abandoned his projected Bible of Hell, but not before he had engraved two further books for it. That The Book of Ahania and The Book of Los were both originally conceived as part of Blake's Bible of Hell is strongly suggested by the textual format of these works, as we have already seen. But the two later works also follow Urizen by reflecting in their textual procedures the influence of the new biblical</page><page sequence="22">324 JEROME J. McGANN criticism. This correspondence between the three works, in the context of Geddes' biblical criticism, may not be noticeable at first, because we do not observe in the two later works the same sort of incongruities which are apparent in Urizen. This lack of immediate similarity is partly a consequence of the fact that the two later works only survive in unique copies. Nevertheless, that Blake is still parodying the Bible along the Geddes line in The Book of Ahania and The Book of Los is very clear. The Book of Los repeats much of the narrative we have in Urizen, but from a slightly different point of view. Furthermore, both Ahania and Los report details which contradict equivalent texts in Urizen.51 None of this rep resents carelessness on Blake's part, or an uncertainty about how to deploy his mythic materials, although these are two conclusions which could easily be drawn from the textual circumstances. On the contrary, the textual anomalies are structural; they are part of a deliberate effort to critique the received Bible and its traditional exegetes from the point of view of the latest research findings of the new historical philology. Urizen and its two companion works are formally related to the fictional reconstructions carried out by Macpherson and Chatterton. The models for the Ossian and Rowley poems are taken from the antiquarian tradition, however, whereas Blake's poems would not have been pos sible without the historical scholarship of men like Griesbach, Eichhorn, and Geddes. Such men, along with their contemporary counterparts in classical philology, laid the groundwork for a whole new hermeneu tics. These scholarly advances had the most profound impact upon the poetry and fiction of the nineteenth century, and especially in the imaginative treatment of historical and legendary materials. They are the equivalent, in literary studies, of the archaeological and anthropological research carried out by men like Winckelmann and Sir William Jones, and spon sored by organizations like the Society of the Dilettanti. In Blake and the other writers of the early nineteenth century, these new scholarly models served as tools for revealing?in the words of Army tage, Words worth's local antiquarian?"things which you cannot see." To read The Book of Urizen is to discover a Bible one had never known before; it is to learn to read the traditional Bible in an entirely new way. California Institute of Technology 51. W. H. Stevenson notes that Los and Urizen "are not consistent" with each other: "In Urizen [lines 196 ff.] Los has already been working at his anvil for some time, and has created the spine which he here [Los line 133] discovers." See The Poems of William Blake (London: Longman's 1971) 284. For other parallels compare Urizen Plate 4: 14 ff. and Los Plate 3: 27 ff.; Ahania Plate 4: 41-42 and Urizen Plate 28: 9-10; and compare Los chaps. 3-4 with Urizen chaps. 8-9.</page></plain_text>
