<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rhys Carpenter Greek Sculpture: A Critical Review, xiv - 276 pp., 70 ill. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1960. $6.95. Although from the title one would expect to find in this volume a "history" of Greek sculpture, it contains rather an account of the technical and stylistic development from sev- enth century beginnings to the late second cen- tury B.C. The thesis presented here is that "the technique of the artist's craft is the mirror in which the pageant of changing and evolving style is reflected" and "that sculptural styles are not casual mannerisms, such as any artist might at any time invent and popularize, but are strictly conditioned by evolutionary laws which are in turn dependent upon the un- changeable dictates of the mechanism of hu- man vision." Beginning with a fully matured glyptic tech- nique inherited from the Egyptians, Greek sculpture never had a primitive phase. Since the earliest statues are of Parian and Naxian marble, Carpenter conjectures that Paros re- ceived the sculptor's craft from Egypt and passed it on to Attica. A center of diffusion in the south Aegean is believed to have been re- sponsible for the uniformity of early types. But only the formal inspiration and the technical processes came from Egypt; otherwise Greek sculpture was a manifestation of the uniquely original creative genius of the Greeks. Attacking the block of stone directly, guided by linear drawings on its surfaces, the sculptor of archaic Greece inevitably produced statues with four sides. The musculature was sche- matic and often exaggerated. As these schematic forms became more complex, some showed in- creased observation of nature while others be- came more decorative; but the tectonic struc- ture formulated in the archaic period remained predominant in nude male figures well into the Roman era. For draped female figures, the drap- ery was merely added in linear patterns over the nude form; later, drapery took on greater substance and the bodily form became less ap- parent. Bronze sculpture followed the same glyptic tradition, beginning, Carpenter believes, with a full-sized wooden image which was then dis- membered for casting. In accepting the Greek tradition of the invention of hollow-casting by Rhoikos and Theodoros of Samos, Carpenter would seem to belittle Egyptian knowledge. Though the sculptural tradition in bronze was the same as in stone, the former enjoyed greater freedom of pose, because of the greater tensile strength of the material, as well as release from spatial restrictions, made possible by piece cast- ing. Myron's Discobolus, really only a figure in high relief, already implied motion, follow- ing a tradition that began with the graphic arts, passed thence to relief sculpture and then to sculpture in the round. Dissatisfied with the limitations of archaic sculpture, fifth century artists introduced sym- metry and a canon, achieving the idealism char- acteristic of the classic style. By the slight rais- ing of one leg and the curve of the body, living balance was achieved. But one of the main prob- lems was to give to figures a sense of modeled depth and it was learned in the Olympia pedi- ments that this could be done with drapery through the device of the modeling line. The next pedimental groups, those of the Parthe- non, were fully stereomorphic. By the end of the fifth century, the catenary, the motion line and illusionary transparency had been added to feminine drapery. In the next stage, the High Classic, abstract formalism became modified into formalized naturalism. But even in the early works of Lysippos there was still depend- ence on Polykleitan anatomic tradition with its inherent four-sidedness. Torsion was intro- duced in his later works, having had a limited use already in the fifth century, but only in the third century was "omnifacial stereomorphic presentation" achieved. Sculpture continued its formal evolution into the Hellenistic period, with both the At- tic and Lysippan traditions going on, but the formal development ended in the early Hellen- istic age, when the technique of mimetic fidelity triumphed over the artificialities of the Classic tradition. But a great change occurred towards the end of the third century when Attalos of Pergamon began to plunder the sculptural treasures of Greece and ordered copies made of statues in Athens. As a result, the second century saw a return to earlier formal tradi- tions. Fifth century devices were combined with Hellenistic traits, Pegamene sculptors experi- mented with old forms to produce new effects. To the middle third of the century belongs a "Baroque" style that ended with the Pergamene kingdom in 133 B.C. To this second century school Carpenter ascribes a number of works that have usually been otherwise attributed: the Victory of Samothrace, the Aphrodite of Melos, the Demeter of Knidos, both the Maussolos and the Artemisia, the Warrior of Agasias, the Barberini Faun, Laokoon, the Suicidal Gaul and the Menelaos and Patroklos. A final chapter is devoted to Greek portrait sculpture and its place in the general frame- work of evolutionary sculptural style. If a por- trait is a faithful likeness, then Carpenter dis- misses all so-called portraits made before about 200 B.C., for only then did there evolve the necessary plastic technique of making a full- scale preliminary model in wax for use by the bronze-caster. All the Hellenistic portraits are in bronze, for this was not a technique adapted to stone-cutting; the marble copies of Hellenis- tic portraits are Roman. The plastic medium also enabled the Hellenistic artists to achieve hitherto unattempted sculptural compositions of great spatial complexity, which could not be visualized graphically and so could not be pro- duced glyptically without the guidance of a pre- liminary model. Here, then, is a system of objective criteria by which Greek sculpture may be classified into styles and periods. It is convincingly presented, in part with the aid of well chosen and finely reproduced illustrations. One result is the re- dating and re-attribution of a number of sculp- tures, with sound reason it would seem. These will not go unchallenged, but in the test the new system will find ample opportunity to prove itself, as it probably will. SAUL S. WEINBERG University of Missouri Alfred Frankenstein Angels Over the Altar: Christian Folk Art in Hawaii and the South Seas, photographs by Nor- man Carlson, x + 102 pp., 57 ill. (30 in color). Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1961. $12.00. This delightful book describes three painted churches in Hawaii: St. Benedict's at Honau- nau, Maria Lanakila near Kealia, and the Star of the Sea at Kalapana. The paintings were ex- ecuted by two Belgian priests, Father John Jo- seph Velghe (1857-1934) and Father Evarist Gielen (born 1897). Several other churches are mentioned more briefly, and the work of a pre- cursor of the painters, Michel-Eutrope Blanc (died 1899), is also discussed. Blanc's work as a religious sculptor attracted the attention of Robert Louis Stevenson in 1888, and Franken- stein thinks that Stevenson's remarks about him may be "the first salute in history from the world of the intellect to the world of the liv- ing primitive or folk artist." Father John was ordained into a missionary order, the Fathers of the Sacred Heart, in 1888 and was immediately sent to the Marquesas. He was in Hawaii from 1899 to 1904, when he re- turned to Belgium. He and Father Evarist were self-taught painters, whose work was done en- tirely for functional purposes, and in no sense as self-expression or self-realization. They were consequently perfectly willing to adapt, to copy, from obvious sources. They did not consider themselves professional painters, they made no attempt to be original, and it is significant to note that the still-living Father Evarist has ap- parently painted nothing since the 1930's. The sources to which these isolated priests turned were not in themselves significant. Nine- teenth century German academic painters (Karl Gebhardt, Bernhard Plockhorst, Joseph Jans- sens), an unidentified artist named Ruysbroeck, and a collection of pious engravings called Le catechisme en images, seem to have been their chief models. In this they were like the anony- mous artists of the middle ages, who assimi- lated useful material from the most available sources. But the remarkable thing about these priests is the fact that all of this obvious and very ordinary academic material was trans- formed by their honesty and their (yes, let us say it) goodness, into work which is on a much higher level, both in form and in content. Frankenstein writes, "Father Evarist tells us that in painting all these things his sole con- cern was to interest and instruct his parishion- ers and that he had neither time nor desire to indulge in originality. . . . Very little in the church is Father Evarist's own and yet every- thing in it is his own; he has utterly trans- formed every motif he has touched and in most cases he has enormously heightened its pictor- ial value. .. . [His] touch has conferred the highest degree of vitality and spirit upon these lifeless, otherwise long-forgotten things." The church at Honaunau is a small wooden structure (carpenter's Gothic) with a pointed barrel-vaulted ceiling. The flat altar wall opens up with an astonishing painted perspective of the cimborio of the Cathedral of Burgos, while the walls at the ends of the side-aisles show us distant perspective views of the transepts of the same Gothic cathedral. This bold illusion was probably the result of Father John's fa- miliarity with a comparable painted perspec- ART JOURNAL XXII 2 128</page><page sequence="2">tive which Louis Daguerre, the pioneer photog- rapher, painted for the parish church of Bry- sur-Marne, near Paris, in 1842, and which the Belgian priest must have seen. Each side wall contains three paintings, with pseudo-Gothic painted lunettes and nitches above. One of the narrative paintings (The Appearance of the Cross to St. Francis) introduces a cavernous background which is copied from an old photo- graph of a road tunnel near Lucerne, another (Cain and Abel) is a copy of an academic work by a Munich artist, Gebhardt, but with "much greater tension, anguish, and violence than . . . the original." The sources of the other four paintings have not been identified, though Frankenstein characterizes some of the figures in the Hell as "a tormented crew worthy of Masaccio." Probably earlier than Honaunau was the ruined church near Kealia, largely destroyed in an earthquake in 1950. In this small building the paintings were executed directly on the plaster walls, and the fragmentary remains of a young girl kneeling before a cross, with Mary and Jesus on the opposite side, are extraordi- narily evocative of the great traditions of west- ern European religious art. Father Evarist was a student of Father John, and created his own masterpiece in the church at Kalapana in 1930. Here there are six ceiling paintings, four ceiling angels, the Sistine Ma- donna of Raphael on the altar wall, an enor- mous Nativity (22 by 14 feet), and various decorative details. Most interesting are the di- rect comparisons which can be made between the banal and flabby originals and the strangely moving and intense paintings adapted from them. Here one may see, as Frankenstein writes, "how signally the folk artist has improved on his model. In fitting these angels into a pre-es- tablished, geometrically outlined space, Father Evarist was forced to elongate their figures and place them horizontally rather than vertically; he simplified and enhanced the rhythm of their drapery, flattened the modeling of the figures, and in all but the blue angel reversed the curves of the wings, thereby enormously in- creasing the strength of each silhouette. He also gave these angels small heads with pointed chins and long, Modigliani-like noses; this is the final touch of departure from the anthro- pomorphic realism of his model." No doubt the weathered condition of the paintings in all three churches has toned down the original rather garish colors, which also adds to our present enjoyment of them. I think we know much more about the spe- cific attitude of the folk artist after reading this book and studying these reproductions than we did before. This is an exercise which should be brought to the attention of all those who are concerned with the problem of the life of style, of the continuity of tradition. It helps us to understand certain far removed stylistic de- velopments in early mediaeval times as well as to define and evaluate the non-historical, un- selfconscious artist who may be living today. It is a pleasure to handle a book so well- made and so well-designed. The photographs by Norman Carlson are first-rate, the color plates excellent. It is altogether a rare and heart-warming study, beautifully and modestly accomplished. ALLEN S. WELLER The University of Illinois Tibor Bodrogi Art in North-East New Guinea, tr. tva R6cz, 228 pp., 240 ill. (8 in color). Budapest: Publishing House of the Hungarian Acad- emy of Sciences, 1961. $9.50. The Huon Gulf area of north-east New Guinea has long been regarded as the home- ground of one of the island's most distinctive art-styles. Its individuality was first proposed by Finsch in 1888, and again by Preuss in 1897 -early dates in the study of New Guinea ethnology. It was isolated by Gladys Reichard in 1933 as the "Tami style," so named for the bowls made on that small group of off-shore islands. In 1936 Speiser, in his semi-historical study of New Guinea art, suggested the Tami style as lately-formed but critically representa- tive, with widely disseminated influence in Mel- anesia. In spite of the broad promise of its title, Tibor Bodrogi's book is actually confined to a study of this notable style, and is the first ex- tensive work devoted to it. The book has some quite crucial limitations. Like so many other studies of the kind, it has been written without benefit of field-work; inevitably, since by now any attempt at such investigation of the art would be pointless, owing to its extinction as a living form during the course of the changes the native culture has undergone in the last half-century. Bodrogi has had, however, the benefit of one invaluable source: the Ethno- graphical Museum of Budapest (of which he is Director) possesses the rich collection of about 1,000 objects Lajos Biro made in 1898- 1899, only five years after continuous contact with Europeans began. While Biro himself published his material on Astrolabe Bay and the Aitape regions, his Huon Gulf notes re- mained in manuscript. Bodrogi has been able, therefore, to draw on Bir6's collection and writings, with side-lights from some other con- tinental museums. No Australian museum's col- lection is considered, nor is the quantity of im- portant objects and information collected by A. B. Lewis from Bamler and Voogdt about 1909 for the Chicago Natural History Museum. The book is arranged on an attractively sim- ple and useful plan. The meat of it is in three sections. The first describes "The Background" -geography, material culture, social organiza- tion and religious life; the next, "Art," is a series of detailed accounts of categories of ob- jects, arranged according to materials; followed by a study of "Motifs"-anthropomorphic, zoo- morphic and geometric. One can only read the second section, in particular, with enthusiasm and admiration for the painstaking thorough- ness with which Bodrogi has assembled an im- pressive mass of material. The types of objects which he has failed to classify, describe and il- lustrate must be few indeed, if they exist at all. Each account deals as fully as possible with technical methods of manufacture, use and sig- nificance. There will hardly be any excuse in the future for the cataloguist who misassigns an object from the area. The section on "Mo- tifs" is also of a rare comprehensiveness: a somewhat Haddonesque lexicon of the pattern- elements on which the prominent two-dimen- sional quotient of all Huon Gulf objects is based. They are interpreted and assigned to their normal contexts in the art with consider- able detail. The last section-"Conclusions"-deals with the social functions of the art objects; the dis- tribution of the style; and its ultimate aesthetic value. In general, this part of the book is the most open to criticism. The discussion of dis- tribution is based on the presumption that Huon Gulf art shows a unified style. Bodrogi concludes this from the idea of the Gulf peo- ple's desire for an admired standard, and the widespread trading of some objects from the Tami Islands. One cannot but think that here he is too concerned with the subjective attitude of the people themselves. It would have been valuable if, after establishing the geographical boundaries of his main area, Bodrogi had gone on to demarcate the sub-areas which the actual objects quite visibly suggest. To state that this is the least satisfactory sec- tion is to say no more than Bodrogi admits, since its shortcomings follow inevitably from the standard he sets himself. He takes as fun- damentally valid Raymond Firth's proposition that "all art is composed in a social setting; it has a cultural content." This idea, so far from new to students of the European arts, seems only now about to receive general acceptance among anthropologists and ethnologists. Even so, its possibilities have not yet been fully ex- plored by students of primitive art, though some field-work is at last being conducted on these lines. One may indeed hope that such in- vestigations will play a major r6le in studies of African and Oceanic art for some time to come; combined with detailed investigations of what may loosely be called "symbolism," it is likely that they will give us the insights needed for a real understanding of the subject. Bodrogi is hampered by the fact that his sources are, as he says, "rather laconic whenever they refer to the social-cultural relations of art as a whole"; to the extent that they hardly permit him to em- bark on any positive formulations of the kind he suggests as desirable. In a typically para- doxical situation, he returns for the last word on style to the work of art-historians, and Lin- ton's and Wingert's description of Huon Gulf art (in their Arts of the South Seas) as char- acterised by "lethargic heaviness and inert- ness." His familiarity with the social structure, however, leads him to correct their rather too bald equation of this "static" art with a "sta- tic" society. His observations on this point- taking into account considerations of technique as well as social conditions-are so acute that one wishes he had developed this line of thought further, or that he will do so in some future publication on a more fruitful area. What he does not discuss-though admittedly it is hardly within his charter to do so-is the question of reconciling social and technical facts with differing aesthetic evaluations. This kind of debatable point is familiar enough to art historians-not to mention day-to-day crit- ics-in other fields; students of primitive art must be prepared to face it sooner or later, when a greater flexibility of aesthetic judge- ment becomes possible to them. When all due reservations have been made, within the limits of the material available to him, and those he has imposed on himself with some rigour, Bodrogi has produced a book which is not likely to be soon replaced.
