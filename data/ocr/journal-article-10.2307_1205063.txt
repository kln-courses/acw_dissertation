<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews all the same, what today's students would make of parts of it and of phrases such as "the inner existence of Socrates" (p. 16). The Buddha was one such master, and in his essay on "Mah-yana Buddhism" Wach speaks of the "awe" that the majesty of the Buddha arouses-not in Bud- dhists only, but "in us"-and of the "something other," which "makes men shud- der even when they only perceive the presence of the Buddha from afar" (p. 51). Wach's intellectual and spiritual heritage, from Schleiermacher, by way of S6derblom, Heiler, and Otto, is clearly important. Wach, no less than his men- tors, was settling accounts with historicism and laying foundations for enter- prises as diverse, and yet as similar, as hermeneutics, phenomenology, and dialogue. Perhaps Wach did not proceed quite so far, dialogically, as Heiler was tempted to. But in his essay on "Radhakrishnan and the Comparative Study of Religion," first published in 1952, Wach enters into dialogue with this century's most nota- ble Hindu apologist. Here politeness pulls him in one direction, as he writes of "the untiring efforts on the part of this great Hindu scholar to do justice to Chris- tianity" (p. 118), and honesty in another, as on the next page he acknowledges the "notable trace of bitterness" in so much of Radhakrishnan's writing on the subject of Christianity. That, though, is part of the dialectic of which real dia- logue is made. Wach's Introduction to the History of Religions volume is far more of a unity than is the book of Essays. I do not propose to try to summarize it. To do so would be an impertinence. But I was intrigued to learn that a rough draft had been used by Kitagawa as a classroom text for years. The writing of textbooks is clearly an awe- some responsibility. But that brings me to one final point. We speak constantly of the history of religion(s)-though I still do not quite grasp why Wach was so determined, in later years, to use the plural, rather than the singular form-but I am not sure that many of us have thought enough about the historiography of religion(s). But that surely is at the heart of the hermeneutical enterprise: the art and craft of actually communicating what one believes oneself to have learned. Excellent scholars may be wretched communi- cators, and vice versa. But historiography is a complex and intriguing business, since it communicates, not only facts, but also images and impressions. One does not necessarily read books written half a century ago as quarries of facts. One may on the other hand use them to inform oneself about an important segment of modern social and intellectual history. It is so in this present case. These two excellent volumes of Wach may be read with an eye to religion; or alternatively, with an eye to the place of religion in modern European and American intellectual history. Either way, we are grateful to have them. The writing of social history in fully conscious awareness of the place of the history of religion(s)-or for those who prefer, comparative relig- ion-in the totality, has scarcely even been attempted. When (or perhaps if) it is, volumes like this will gain still more in value. ERIC J. SHARPE, University of Sydney. GUTHRIE, STEWART. A Japanese New Religion: Risshb Kosei-kai in a Mountain Ham- let. Ann Arbor, Mich.: Center forJapanese Studies, 1988. xiv+245 pp. $21.95. The professed intention of Stewart Guthrie's A Japanese New Religion is "to describe why some people in a Japanese hamlet have joined a major religious 453</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion movement, what it has done for them, and especially how it helps them, as 'estab- lished' (kisei) religion helps others, interpret and influence important events in their lives" (p. 1). The book is quite successful in this task, although readers already familiar with religion in contemporary Japan will find little that is partic- ularly new or startling in his ethnographic findings. While claiming to be a study of a Japanese "new religion," however, the book would be more accurately por- trayed as a conventional study of traditional Japanese popular religion as it con- fronts the modern world. On another level, one is tempted to suggest that the book constitutes a critique of the fieldwork method itself, given that at almost every turn we find the author retreating from any substantive new claims or insights based on his work in Japan some seventeen years ago. Indeed, as his somewhat disingenuous citations indi- cate, there is little that is essential to Guthrie's analysis that he could not have dis- covered more economically and efficiently in a good library back home. Guthrie himself acknowledges that his research has yielded chiefly confirmatory evidence for earlier studies of traditional communities like his and for recent works on Japan's New Religions as well. But it should be quickly pointed out that he has produced a highly readable account that many others who have spent consider- able time in Japan's countryside have not had the patience or energy to write. For that alone we should be grateful. That he has rehearsed standard observa- tions about Japanese popular religion and has at times burdened his emic data with more of the weight of his theoretical argument than it can bear does not diminish the inherent value and interest of the topic itself, and Guthrie's mono- graph makes available to the nonspecialist a convenient introduction to many important aspects of contemporary Japanese religion. At the same time, Guthrie has attempted much more than a simple ethnogra- phy, for behind his survey of religion in the hamlet of Yamanaka is a thoughtful attempt to illustrate and test the grander theory of religion, the principal features of which he first proposed in 1980 ("A Cognitive Theory of Religion," Current Anthropology, vol. 21 [April 1980]). "In my view, although religion and science differ in methodology and topical emphasis, they share a concern to explain and control experience systematically and economically, and do so by the same chief method, analogy" (pp. 4-5). What fundamentally distinguishes reli- gion from science in this view is not its method or intentions, then, but rather its anthropomorphic model, which "attributes a human level of organization to the nonhuman universe, in part or in whole" (p. 12). With his theory Guthrie is able to demonstrate that adherence to either a "tra- ditional" or a "new" religious system does not require the suspension of rational- ity, and that such systems are not necessarily incompatible with scientific ("nonhuman") ones. Just as scientific models are empirical and subject to revi- sion, so also are religious ones. But this is precisely where Guthrie finds his ethno- graphic data most troublesome. For while he rightly perceives the continuity between traditional and revised religious patterns in the lives of his informants and finds an increasing need for accommodation of both to modern science and technology, he is forced to conclude that the "most interesting" result of his study is that "in Yamanaka 'religious' and much 'secular' thought and action share a major model and some major principles.... There is no evident break between ordinary and religious life" (p. 205). What, then, are we to understand as distinctive or, for that matter, distinctively religious about this "new religion" in Yamanaka? As Guthrie himself concedes, Kosei-kai's model is simply "an elab- oration of a model already important in Yamanaka and in Japan generally" (p. 454</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 200). Clearly, Guthrie's dilemma is that either his conventional ethnographic premise (the significant presence of a new religion in Yamanaka) or his otherwise compelling theoretical conclusion is mistaken. Unfortunately, A Japanese New Religion leaves this dilemma unresolved-and the reader unsatisfied. In other words, his theoretical argument does challenge conventional wisdom, which persists, first of all, in the dubious habit of treating religion as a necessarily discrete aspect of human life, and second, in describing all Japanese "religion" by reference to "organized religion" (p. 57, passim). Yet, despite his own apparent misgivings, it is with just such terms (Buddhism, Shinto, Rish6 K sei-kai) that Guthrie has chosen to frame his discussion. One only wishes that he had been bolder and more ambitious, that he had pursued his argument to its logical conclusion. The consolation is that, for the ambitious reader intent on probing new possibilities in the study of religion, Guthrie has at the very least provided some useful tools. EDMUND T. GILDAY, Bowdoin College. TAYLOR, MARK C. Altarity. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987. xxxiv+371 pp. $42.50 (cloth); $15.95 (paper). Altarity is a sophisticated introduction and presentation of primarily philosophi- cal studies that are representative of both the background and foreground of de- constructive hermeneutics in literary theory, philosophy and theology. It is an important theoretical companion to his anthology Deconstruction in Context: Liter- ature and Philosophy (Chicago, 1986). Taylor is teaching the reader how to read. The significance of the book is twofold. First, it is an important historical study of sources introducing lesser-known precursor figures, Georges Bataille, Maurice Blanchot, Emmanuel Levinas; it is an important and complex reading of G. W. F. Hegel and Soren Kierkegaard; and, it provides an elucidating analysis of difficult modern and postmodern figures such as Martin Heidegger, Jacques Lacan, Julia Kristeva, and Jacques Derrida. The analysis of Derrida's Glas is exemplary of the quality of Taylor's intellec- tual historical analyses as he introduces and moves the discussion of deconstruc- tion toward an increasingly complex weave of philosophical concepts. Throughout the book Taylor locates the importance of Hegel for the contempo- rary discussion of deconstruction and gives a deep reading of the Hegelian prob- lematic in Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and other precursors and players of postmodern philosophical discourses. These are but a few suggestions of how Taylor makes an important contribution to historical scholarship because of his abilities to do strong readings of difficult texts. Within the development of his work as an intellectual historian Taylor is also recovering and sometimes nuancing important concepts that will pressure critical deconstructionist litera- ture. For example, the articulation of otherness in the reading of alterities as altarities theologically valences this work, giving it theological relevance and also drawing deconstructionist philosophical and literary works toward a theological moment. In addition, Taylor is marking out his own philosophical and theological posi- tion. Taylor writes with a double agenda. The originality of this book is that it is a practice of philosophical and theologi- cal thinking that works against the text as a book in the ordinary sense of what we mean by a book. Taylor's text is fissured by reproductions of visual works of art 455</page></plain_text>
