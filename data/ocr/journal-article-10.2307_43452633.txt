<plain_text><page sequence="1">WarGames Situation Room. Thunder «1 the Riģht by Harlan Jacobson What a bunch of good old boys there were in the platoon. - The Naked and the Dead Somehow it only seems natural that the disappointment and futility of the Vietnam War would have spilled over into suspicion of the military, and that suspicion would've lasted so much longer than it has. True, there is a long history of blaming the message bearer for bad news and the spear carrier for bad war, and for a while - when the atmo- sphere was superheated with dissent over the ongoing war - the defense es- tablishment, or war department (de- pending upon your reading of a complex set of values), took its lumps. In fact, some of the domestic shellfire lobbed at the military has been defused or returned, à la William Westmore- land's pending suit against CBS' 60 Min- utes, which came to symbolize the coun- tervailing check on just about film COMMENT everything during the Seventies. And it seems the discussion of what went wrong has been redirected from the body count in the rice paddies back up- stairs to Nixon and Kissinger with the publication of Seymour Hersh's The Price of Power. Perhaps that is where it always be- longed. The popular view of the military has always been clouded by - oddly enough - its human face. Clearly, the stars of whether on the silver screen or the home screen, were not only medics, they were our medics, even if they patched up a platoon of Koreans and achieved antiwar status. In the last six years, in important ways, not only the military image but the mythol- ogy has been picked up off the ground where it had briefly rested like the dis- carded medals of the Vietnam veterans, and been given a shine. Hey, it ain't so bad in the army! There are times a man - or a woman - has gotta do what a per- son's gotta do. Just ask Luke Skywalker. The main- spring of the Star Wars trilogy always appeared to be identification with the resistance and revolt against the imperi- alist forces of Darth Vader. The hook of both Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back lay less in their underlining of John Wayne's individualistic regency - after all, it took two nervous boys, a young girl, a gorilla, and two robots to stand up for freedom - than in the futuristic vis- ual surprises that occurred seemingly | frame by frame. The comic-book vision that Lucas had pulled from inside his head and landed onscreen fomented something of its own aesthetic revolution. There were a few critical carpings about the card- board characterizations, but no matter. Kids returned on a scale approaching 9</page><page sequence="2">Hans Solo , MarkHàmû' logarithmic, and young professionals' dinner parties buzzed with snippets about the Freudian nature of the rela- tionship between Luke and Vader, whose name sounds suspiciously like fa- ther in German. College educations were put to poor use: I seem to remem- ber mouthing something about parallels between Empire and Mao Tse Tung's (that's how I'll always spell it) Long March. Even in Los Angeles Times reporter Dale Pollock's fact-packed account of George Lucas' life, Skywalking, the psy- cho-dynamics behind Lucas' retreat to Marin County after Universal's manhan- dling of American Graffiti manifested it- self in the Star Wars trilogy. Writes Pol- lock: "Hollywood is the Death Star, and Lucas is the eternal rebel." Or later, "Jedi is a movie he first wanted to make as Apocalypse Now: the story of the little guys fighting the technological super- powers and winning because they be- lieve in themselves." Thank God Fran- cis Coppola swiped the Apocalypse project from Lucas. So, it was to Jedi that I went with the same expectation of evil's vanquish- ment amid the visual candy of the screen. But at the screening one quad- rant of the balcony declared its rebellion against Lucas' cultural imperialism with loud gales of laughter. They were guf- fawing at the painful soap-opera pallia- tives for the ache in Luke's oedipal heart. And they were right. Jedi's structure is vaudevillian: smack the müles in the nose early with some- thing freakish, then trot out the enter- tainments. So we are led to the lair of Jabba the Hütt, a mountainous frog with a rubber tongue (in Yiddish, tshabba means frog). Jabba delights in dropping living appetizers into a pit for the culi- nary benefit of one of Godzilla's cousins. After Luke kills this thing, we move on to the predictable ho-hum storyline con- frontation between Luke and Darth, with melodramatic stops along the way. But the entire enterprise is so unsur- prising, Jedi requires another shot of di- gestive revulsion to revive attention. The human cast is dispatched to the desert, out to some hybrid between a mouth and an anus. It "takes 1,000 years" to digest whoever is so con- signed, but the horror of the image is mitigated by the knowledge that no one has lived 1,000 years since Moses, and therefore one is likely to die pretty quick, probably from a terminal case of vagina dentata fright. There were other elements of Jedi 10 that were bothersome. The film seems to have been hijacked by the Muppets, with Miss Piggy having gotten her entire extended family roles as Jabba's footsol- diers; there's no rationale for the height- ened violence other than that fairy tales do it; the feeling persists that Billy Dee Williams has been cast as a piece of toast in a saga of Wonder Bread Goes To War for no reason other than Lucas felt he had to stamp out the (unfair) charge of racism. It isn't that Lucas has lost his touch in the intervening years as much as the audience has changed - or, more ex- actly, been changed by the very techno- graphic wizardry and anthropomorphic outer world Lucas so dazzlingly placed before us originally. Shifting into Hyper- space is something toilet bowl cleansers now accomplish in TV commercials. Chewbacca, the gorilla-wookie, is less startling and more capable of conversa- tion than the Plasmatics, and, in fact, most people would sooner have him over to dinner. The one constant in Jedi that holds over, but less strikingly, is the technol- ogy. I have always thought that what we viewed as important or amusing in Star Wars - the simple, comic-book story, the normality of geekish relationships, etc. - took a back seat to the airplanes everyone darted about in. Sure they of- fered wonderful, laser-like roller-coaster rides, made even more fun by Han Solo's "Let's see what this crate can do." But they also looked and handled a lot like the U.S. Air Force's F-15, and since seeing Star Wars I've wondered how many generals in how many client states saw the film and got on the phone to Lockheed, or McDonnell-Douglas, or the Pentagon, and said "I'll take a hun- dred dozen of those." To that extent, Star Wars has made it that much easier for the military estab- lishment to make its requests for a big- ger share of the budgetary pie. Woe to most Congressmen who stand in the way of the munitions works on which half the export economy rests, which has the approval of the voters, and which spills over onto the dashboards of their Japanese-made cars. Lucas has, in ef- fect, made armaments fun, and he's ad- vertised our wares in a way that no bro- chure, slide show, or bikini-stuffed parade at a munitions convention ever could. And where the buck comes from is where foreign policy must logically go. • Star Wars fit into, or perhaps reigni- ted, the romanticization of the military in American films, which rode like a tidal wave over the futility films of Apoc- alypse Now , The Deer Hunter , and Com- ing Home. In these, the heroes lost their legs, lost their wives, lost their hearts, minds, and lives. Whatever was gained cost too much. The root was, of course, All Quiet on the Western Front , in which the military was depicted as Pied Piper to a meat grinder. Maybe it's since Private Benjamin that the idea has again taken hold that the military is good for you. It was followed in almost indecent succession by Stripes , An Officer and A Gentleman , Taps, and The Lords of Discipline. All these films express some kind of longing for a truly democratic institution to make us all equal, to put us all back in the same boat in these fractious times - so long as we can lead the platoon. The subtext in these romanticizations has less to do with the army as a neces- sary mechanism to keep the peace or make war than it does with the disorgan- ization of personality that the hero or heroine - and, by extension, the con- temporary audience - experiences. You can put the pieces back together again in the armed services, you can find your hidden strengths, you can discover The Force within you. What else was a dec- ade of self-help books, cultism, and mysticism dancing around in orange pa- jamas at the airport but a rejection of what had been the standard, secular cure-all for being a mess, the military? It's one thing to make pro-military- life films, even when they are as offbeat as Stripes , which basically advocated cre- ativity (anti-authority) instead of disci- pline as the fulcrum of morale. It's alto-</page><page sequence="3">Biíl Murray in Stripes. Richard Gere in Utticer. maChewbacca. gether different to make a pro-cult film. "Hey, what wacky good times ev- eryone has hustling dimes for Rev. Moon!" The most ludicrous misunder- standing of the marketplace was Moon's, when he produced his Inchon homage to Douglas MacArthur, simply because the word was out that Moon had produced it. The saving grace to Holly- wood may be that it tries to be market- sensitive and produces films that don't want to steal your children, just borrow them for a couple of hours. Of course, what angers parents is that the film is meant to wean the kid from their author- ity - how else get a kid through the the- ater door? While the prevailing right-wing ethic is Frank Sinatra's "I did it my way," the appeal of An Officer and a Gentleman more nearly speaks the Right's truth: "You better do it their way." That the film corralled some $100 million at the boxoffice meant that, at some level, it fulfilled a lot of wishes. The most ob- vious was a secret female wish to be swept out of coaltown by a man in white and be taken care of - the audacity of which was a bit surprising in the Eighties. While that was good for some conversational "who'da thunk its," the idea was simply accepted that Richard Gere needed the army to transform him- self from ragamuffin to man. Bring back Shane in the form of George Miller's Australian film, The Road Warrior, which is basically a film of military anarchy, and Warner Bros, made the market judg- ment to lay low. The romance of the unit, of belong- ing, is more than simply the avoidance of having to take a stand, to stand out, as Mel Gibson did in Road Warrior . That Kojak gave way to Hill St. Blues reflects more than the fizzled lifespan of a TV series; it expresses the underlying long- ing for a democratic institution - one that will take anybody, as long as they have a nice smile - to bottle up all the anti-social forces and fears that have been let loose. What else is Superman , /, //, or /// but Super-Cop? True, David and Leslie Newman's III script means to poke fun at this Super-ego, but where- except in the original source material - is it writ- ten that Superman's only mission is to fight criminals, either of a street nature (which seems a waste of time and en- ergy) or of a global nature? He could use his super powers to cure cancer or, at the very least, stop the common cold. He could use his super authority to mandate world peace, not unlike the proposition put forth in The Day the Earth Stood Still. No, Superman has bought the farm; he's one alien who likes things just as they are. To that extent his attitudes are a lot like other successful immigrants' - don't let anybody else in, and be conser- vative. Where Lucas differed from other sci- fi filmmakers is that he transported us out to the alien's world, where they're just as normal as we are. However, all too often they rule according to the whims of monarchy, and therefore de- serve their destruction at the hands of Luke, et al. Only Steven Spielberg im- ports aliens, nice friendly little fellows in both his Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial , which basically transmit the humanist message of the Left: you can stop the terror, all of it, if you'll just all love each other. • It was Lionel Trilling who said some- thing to the effect that Liberals love their mothers, Conservatives love their fathers. If that's true, the romanticiza- tion of the service - which made sense in vintage World War II films, because the concept of Cincinnatus, of defense, was still valid - is a disservice to its audi- ence. That's where WarGames steps in, be- cause it starts from the premise that An Officer and A Gentleman is a joke. Be- lieving in the military fighting unit re- quires some greater cynicism now than it used to. We might need to drop in a platoon now and then to serve our inter- ests or save an embassy, but our defense strategy is predicated upon nothing re- sembling individual mettle or heroism. WarGames lays it out pretty clearly: we are defending ourselves electronically with a hundred people sitting out in a steel vault buried inside a mountain in Colorado. We are listening for the igni- tion switches on a thousand Soviet mis- siles, and they are listening for ours. Open up The New York Times , and there on the front page are side-by-side articles worrying about the very accident that Walter Parkes and Lawrence Lasker scripted and John Badham di- rected in WarGames: "Some policy makers and military thinkers speak warily but with disturb- ing frequency, of the possibility of launching American nuclear missiles on the sole basis of electronic warning that an enemy missile attack has begun ..." (continued on page 74) 11</page><page sequence="4">Blue Thunder on the loose. JACOBSON (continued from page 11) Or: "Skeptics worry that mistakes made here [at the NORAD facility at Iron Mountain, Colo.] by man or machine could make a false alarm look like an attack. That might lead ... to a Presi- dential decision to fire United States missiles in retaliation, thus possibly starting a nuclear war by accident." While WarGames cooks along with the threat that this pisher , Mathew Bro- derick, has inadvertently tapped into the NORAD computer (which the 15- year old son of a Yale professor appar- ently did accomplish) and triggered an unstoppable U.S. retaliation to a phan- tom Soviet launch, the film works won- derfully. It works just on the level of travelogue, growing a bit absurd when the general (Barry Corbin) asks, "Hello, Cleveland, are you still there?" The seed for WarGames is, of course, Dr. Strangelove , which also expressed deep suspicions about our technological posture toward nuclear war. It's pretty clear that WarGames shares those suspi- cions and rides the same vector from the Left. The film's best joke is also the one that most nearly encapsulates the film's techno-wariness: Says one computer freak, who is fairly normal, to another, who is clearly sub-normal, "Remember how you wanted me to tell you when you're acting anti-social? Well now is if." If the Left is worried about com- puters, the Right has appropriated them as hardware that is more than simply efficient, but also useful in the home and friendly. The monster in War- Games, , named WOPR for War Opera- tion Planned Response, has a relative that one of these days pretty soon you're going to buy and put in your home. It might be named Apple, or Kermit, or Howdy, but its cousin is WOPR. They're building them into your Chevy or Cressida so that it can bid you good morning in a humanoid voice, tell you to buckle up, and then mix fuel dryer than last night's martini. A conser- vative Congressman from Georgia has proposed passage of tax credits for those who buy home computers - not simply to take over the function of incinerating the chicken, but to quote HR 6397, in- troduced May 18, 1982: "to increase in- dividual economic opportunity. . . expand the potential to own their own business, restore the family setting... leam and earn together. .. develop op- portunities for the handicapped... provide a growing pool of computer-literate young people . . . (to) man the sophisticated military of tomor- row, and to decrease home-to-office commuting and national dependence on imported oil." All this, according to environmental psychologist Jamie Horwitz, who spoke at the Barnard Feminist and Scholar Conference last April, spells out the pro- family Right's view of the computer as "a good organizing tool on which to han- dle their entire political agenda." Beyond the tax deduction's aid to middle class families, the consequences of computer proliferation might very well result, according to Horwitz, in de- creased union strength and work rela- tionships, and increased surveillance of the work force, which would also have to juggle home responsibilities and absorb the overhead costs that management once did. Moreover, instead of hourly or salary wage scales, computer work is paid as piece work, which save for the upper income strata that is geared to participate in home computer work, is not unlike the way the garment industry farmed out shmata patterns to immi- grants 80 years ago. It's that techno-terror undergirding WarGames that differentiates it from al- most the entire spate of pro-military films, including, ironically enough, John Badham's other summer release, Blue Thunder. The only wild card in War- Games deck is the same one that existed in Lucas' hand when he dealt the Star Wars Three. Domestic viewers may im- mediately perceive from which side of the political spectrum WarGames was delivered, but there are always those tin-pot bozos across the oceans who will see the Situation Room and the bleep- ing, whirring WOPR and get on the phone to Honeywell and sing "Gimme a WOPR with everything to go, and hurry." Whatever Badham's or Dan O'Bannon's intent (see O'Bannon inter- view, page 52) in Blue Thunder , the re- sult is not so much the denunciation of evil technology as its celebration. The helicopter, named Blue Thunder, is in actuality a flying computer that does all the things Superman is supposed to be able to do: read the labels of the quarry's underpants through steel and concrete, sense the heat of someone in hiding, tape his heat image and sounds, and churn him into hamburger with a ma- chine gun blast of 4,000 rounds directed by the pilot's eyes. Blue Thunder's credit roll tries to heighten reality by informing that the chopper actually exists and will be used to police the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. The picture probably wasn't conceived as a piece of hometown boost- erism, though it may well have occurred to someone in Columbia's Coast offices that it might score a few points with the Mayor. The credit roll might even take the edge off the idiot storyline and the winceable characterizations by Roy Scheider and Daniel Stern, who've both been better elsewhere, but it is also less a point of information perhaps than an admission by Badham of "to hell with the story, look at this thing." It can, after all, be used against any- one. To wit: They finally caught up with Gordon W. Kahl in Walnut Ridge, in the north- eastern foothills of Arkansas, where state routes 67 and 25 meet just a little south of Pochahontas. For nearly four months, they'd hunted this North Da- kota farmer, whose membership in the Posse Comitatus (Power of the County) - a grassroots, quasi-Klan-like group- qualified him as something more than a "tax renegade," as the evening news had described. The World War II gun- ner was killed in a shootout with federal agents, and subsequently denied a mili- tary burial. What snagged my attention in the front-page New York Times story by Houston bureau reporter Wayne King was that the search included use of "an infrared [thermo-sensor] airborne spot- ter that scanned the abandoned farm- houses in the fogbound Dakota country- side." Well, that was Blue Thunder, allright, stalking a son of the far-Right. The irony, of course, is that it missed; they found Kahl the old-fashioned way.^ 74</page></plain_text>
