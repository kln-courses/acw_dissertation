<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY appreciation and support (or denial) of the several functional-developmental or evolutionary schemes post- ulated in recent years for the prehistoric culture se- quences of the Andean region, but Willey barely relates either his data or interpretations, if at all, to those schemes. On the other hand, this kind of criticism is only indicative of the great value of the work in presenting a large body of data of a new kind in Peruvian archae- ology, which opens the possibilities of a much more penetrating understanding of cultural institutions and processes in the Andean area. Willey pleads that the study is experimental, and it is perhaps with that cau- tion in mind that he has refrained from extensive infer- ence or speculation in this first work of its kind. The final chapter, "The Viru Valley in Peruvian Pre- history," places the settlement pattern data in Virui in relation to the rest of the country. The chapter amounts to a summary of the present knowledge of Peruvian prehistoric architecture, very valuable in itself, and serves not least to point up that the present work is unique in the advancement of knowledge of this phase of Peruvian archaeology. The work is excellently organized, with careful cross- referencing, summaries and recapitulations at all stages of presentation, and a wealth of site and valley maps. A series of plates, indifferently reproduced, illustrates the major architectural types in the valley. ROBERT STIGLER Columbia University New York, N.Y. The Civilization of the Maya. J. ERIC S. THOMPSON. Chicago Naturar History Museum, Popular Series, An- thropology, No. 25, 5th edition, Chicago, 1953. 96 pp. $.75. This is the fifth edition of a well-known handbook, first published in 1927. In accord with Museum policy the text has been revised for the most part, rather than entirely rewritten. I have compared this edition with the second edition, published in 1932. The general appearance of the handbook has been considerably improved, and the use of calendered paper has allowed the illustrations to be included in the body of the text. Changes and additions to the illustrations have provided a well-chosen coverage. The apportioning of space by subject matter has been scarcely changed; the greater part of the handbook is based on docu- mentary and ethnographic material. Archaeological dis- coveries have necessitated a rewriting of the historical account (12 pp.), Thompson's recent work on Maya hieroglyphics (Maya Hieroglyphic Writing: Introduction, Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1950) must have suggested the rewriting of his chapter on religion (11 pp.). The other sections of the book show minor changes and additions which give evidence of careful and complete revision. The text is up to date. The author cannot be fairly criticized for faults in relative emphasis of subject material in a text which has not been completely rewritten for 26 years. In general the text seems to me long on mythological and episodic account, short on culture history, settlement patterning, economy, and on material culture in general. There has also been little effort to dissect historical develop- ments from the intricate mass of religious myth and ritual which characterized the conquest period. That these materials represent the results of Mexican main- land influence on the Classic-stage Maya is unques- tioned, and Thompson has long held a leading position in efforts to unravel this tangle. The Civilization of the Mayas can be recommended as a good first reading on the subject. Thompson's recent volume on the Maya (The Rise and Fall of the Maya Civilization, University of Oklahoma Press), gives a clearer view of his present interests and ap- proach. GEORGE W.

Extracted from Cultura, No. 5, Instituto de Antropologia e Etnologia do Para, Brasil, 1953. Pp. 185-205, with 75 figs. on 33 pls. Long surviving Portuguese conquest and missionary contact, the Tapaj6 Indians of the middle Amazon region maintained their pottery art unchanged to the 18th century. In a brief text accompanying an extensive set of illustrations of pottery vessels and ceramic designs from Santarem (cf. Bull. Univ. Mus. 6-2, Philadelphia 1935), Barata discusses the ware from a stylistic or aesthetic point of view, taking up in particular 5 animals which are frequently represented and which inspired the geometrical designs-snake, frog, owl, turtle, and wildcat; anthropomorphic figures are also treated. ERIK K. REED National Park Service Santa Fe, N.M. Revista Colombiana de Antropologia, Segunda Epoca. Instituto Colombiano de Antropologia, Bogoti. Government-supported anthropology in Colombia was reorganized in September, 1952, with the creation of the Instituto Colombiano de Antropologia to replace the older Instituto Etnologico Nacional and the Servicio Arqueologico Nacional. The new Institute initiated a program of publications in June, 1953, with the appear- ance of Vol. I, No. 1, of the Revista Colombiana de Antropologia, replacing the earlier Revista del Instituto Etnol6gico Nacional (4 vols., 1945-1950) and the Boletin de Arqueologia (3 vols., 1945-1951). The continuity between the old and new series is suggested by the phrase "segunda 6poca" added to the numbering of the 300 [ XX, 3, 1955</page></plain_text>
