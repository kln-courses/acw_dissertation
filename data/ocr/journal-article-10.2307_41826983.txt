<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fabric of Time A 2,000-year-old Peruvian textile offers evidence of early Andean calendrical systems. ▲ TH Americas o textiles the ancient played central a people paramount Andean by of Darrell region South soci- o the ancient people of South Americas central Andean region textiles played a paramount soci- etal role, being a portable medium capable of conveying vast quantities of information: ethnic identity, regional affilia- tion, social status, worldview, and, perhaps most important, cosmology Nowhere is this more evident than in a recently restored textile, a mantle, from Perus Paracas Peninsula that is now in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum. The mantle consists of a central panel and friezelike border, both made of natural cotton and brightly dyed camelid wool. An analysis of the intricately decorated garment suggests that it served as a calendar that wove both solar and lunar movements and the rising and set- ting of constellations and stars into a yearly cycle that anticipated the better-known highland Inka calendar by 1,500 years. This early calendrical system served as a farmers almanac, displaying various astronomical, atmospheric, agricultural, and ritual events of significance to the people who made it. The textile, which is contemporary with the famous mummy bundles from Cabezas Largas and the Great Necropolis on the Paracas Peninsula (ca. 200 B.c.- A.D. 300), was discovered in a tomb by a local named José Quintana in the early years of the twentieth century. The grave contained the remains of an adult male seated in a large woven reed basket bundled in layers of cloth, among them the Brooklyn Museum textile. The mans grave contained numer- ous ears of maize, bags of coca leaves, ceramic vessels, and gold ornaments, as well as the bodies of five children who may have been sacrificed. Three of the children were less than one year old. The quality of the textile, the grave offerings, and the presence of what may be sacrificial victims suggests that this person was of high social status, perhaps a chieftain or priest. 46</page><page sequence="2">E 3 V 3 5 6 2 OQ -C H « I £ g 3 © -C a. ce S o JC eu Upon discovery, the textile was quickly sold to Domingo Cáriepa, a local collector from the town of Pisco. In 1924 the Cánepa collection was taken to Lima, where Julio C. Tello, the father of Peruvian archaeology, had the opportuni- ty to study it. This exceptional piece may have drawn Tello to Paracas in 1925 to conduct the first scientific investiga- tion of the regions cemeteries. The textile was later acquired by another collector, Rafael Larco Herrera, and placed on exhibition in the Musée de l'Homme in Paris. Eventually it was sold to the Brooklyn Museum. Tello was the first to suggest that the textile was calendrical in nature. His ideas were published in 1959, some 12 years after his death, in a volume of his work edited by Toribio Mejia Xesspe, his longtime assis- tant. Tello concluded that the fig- ures represented images of a dragon (a feline-serpent conflation), the sun, the moon, and other deities, but he never described the calendri- cal system in detail. Later descrip- tions of the textile and its exquisite imagery were published by Jean Levillier and Raoul D'Harcourt in 1928 and 1962, respectively, but neither author discussed the calendrical system. D'Harcourts analysis did provide the first systematic description and complete ordering of the border figures around the textile, which I have used in my study. More recently, Joerg Haeberli, a retired chemist and recognized expert on Paracas and Nasca art, published an analysis of the calendrical system in the Journal of the Steward Anthropological Society (see Further Reading, p. 90). Having recognized various patternings in the border images, Haeberli concluded that the textile functioned as both a solar and synodic lunar calendar. While I disagree with some aspects of his pioneering research, I believe Haeberli was correct about the textiles function. My study suggests that it also incorporates the movements of various dark cloud constellations (large patches of interstellar dust that can be seen in the night sky) and the movement of bright stars. The American is that best-documented of the calendrical Inka, whose system South vast American calendrical system is that of the Inka, whose vast empire dominated most of the Andean region from the mid fif- teenth-century a.D. until the arrival of the Spanish in 1532. While many details of the Inka calendar remain the subject of scholarly debate, eth- nohistorian R. Tom Zuidema of the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign believes it reckoned a 365-day solar cycle with the two lunar cycles, a 29.53-day synodic period and a 27.32-day sidereal period, both readily observable in the night sky. The synodic lunar cycle defines the period of time it takes for any lunar phase to re-occur (ror example, the moon to pass from full moon to full moon). The sidereal lunar period measures the length of time it takes the moon to realign with a particular star or constellation. Zuidema has argued that the Inka used a 12-month sidereal lunar calendar of 328 days. This calendar was cor- related with the 365-day solar year by the inclusion of a 37- day period between May 3 and June 9. This period was roughly equated, using additional solar-lunar correlations, to a period of time when the Pleiades were invisible because of their proximity to the sun. The Pleiades, associ-</page><page sequence="3">ated with the planting of maize, were an important constellation to many New World peoples. Zuidema found evidence to sup- port his sidereal calendar hypothesis in the 1653 chronicle of the Jesuit missionary Father Bernabé Cobo. While several chroniclers wrote that the Inka Empire was divided into four suyus , or quadrants, that extended outward from their capital city of Cuzco, Cobo states that, in addition to this four-fold division, the Inka landscape was conceptual- ly traversed by 41 or 42 ceques , or invisible lines, that radiated outward from Coricancha or Golden Court- yard, the Inka sun temple at Cuzco. These ceques , on which there were 328 shrines, were evenly distributed in three of the suyus (9 ceques each), while the fourth suyu had 14 or 15 ceques . The number of shrines, 328, is coincident with the number of days in a sidereal lunar year. The number 328 is divisible by 41 eight times, and evidence for the use of an eight-day week by the Inka can be found in several of the Spanish chronicles. This parts: Brooklyn same a central numerical Museum panel arrangement textile, measuring which can 4 has feet be two found by IV2 distinct in feet, the Brooklyn Museum textile, which has two distinct parts: a central panel measuring 4 feet by IV2 feet, and the border band which is covered by a multitude of cross-knit looped figures. The two pieces are connected by a continuous band of small woven flowers. The central panel (see page 50) contains 32 images of a bodiless rayed head that represents a mythical creature Andean scholars call the Oculate Being because of its large eyes. This icon is common on Paracas style pottery of the nearby lea Valley. The 32 heads are arranged in four horizon- tal rows of eight figures each. The panel is vertically divided down the middle so that the 16 images on each half of the textile face the midline. The central panel can be further divided horizon- tally into four quadrants of eight fig- ures each. The textiles border consists of 90 three-dimensional figures - plants and animals, mythological crea- tures, and costumed individuals - that are sewn onto and extend beyond the band of flowers that encircles the textile. The border can be divided into four parts based on the direction in which the figures' feet are oriented. Each side con- tains one change in foot direction at its midpoint, which corresponds with the vertical and horizontal divi- sion of the central panel. Three figures (16, 40, and 49), which I will rerer to as "double-sided" figures, are shown in frontal view on one side of the textile and in posterior view on the back. All remaining figures are shown in frontal view on both sides. The smallest of these double-sided figures, number 40, is a member of a trilogy of figures thought by scholars to rep- resent deity images. In addition, several nearly identical figures (42 and 80, 50 and 26, and 77 and 3) repeat in sym- metrical positions on the textile. Border figure 36 combines two distinct images (a feline and a serpent) into a single form. This double figure is approximately twice the size of other anthropomorphic fig- ures on the textile and for this reason I believe it counts as two, bringing the border figure count to 91 rather than 90. We can identify figure 36 as a shaman by the presence of religious paraphernalia in his hands. In its left hand the fig- ure holds a small feathered fan believed to imbue magical powers of flight or enlightenment upon its holder. In its right hand the figure holds a series of small darts repre- senting the mystical projectiles a shaman "shoots" into his enemies to inflict illness.</page><page sequence="4">The combined images of figure 36 may represent a shamanic transformation into a serpent creature or an instance where a shaman travels into an otherworldly realm occupied by large serpent beings (a common conception in South American cosmology). Shamans frequently ingested hallucinogenic drugs in order to travel to and communicate with the spirit world, and serpents represent one of the most commonly viewed images of shamans in this altered state. The practice of combining two distinct images into one figure has been documented for other textiles of this period, and also may have been a strategy that allowed for the depiction of various astronom- ical counts on the same textile. In order to read the textile as a calendrical device three rules must be followed. First, the change in foot direction on side D marks the beginning and end of the yearly cycle, which is read in a clockwise direction. Second, re- verse counts - the interval derived after counting from a cho- sen figure, which we might call "a" to anoth- er figure which we might call "b" and then back to "a" counting figure "b" only once - demarcate some inter- vals of astronomical and calendrical impor- tance. Third, the num- ber of figures repre- senting the days of a given cycle doe^ not exceed the true length of the astronomical i period. For instance, the true length of the ^ synodic lunar cycle of 29.53 days is shown as | 29 days instead of 30. Once these conventions are recognized, | numerous solar- and lunar-cycle patternings become evident. The 91 border images (89 sin- 1 gle images plus the double figure 36) that encircle the textile represent the 365-day 1 annual solar cycle; 91 days are approximately &lt; one quarter of the solar year (4x91 = 364). The conceptualization of the whole divided * into quarters is well-known for the Inka and other Andean societies. I believe that the tex- tile makers chose to symbolically represent the full solar year as one quarter and, in so j doing, endowed the textile with flexibility for multiple uses and readings. The number of * border images provided a convenient way of depicting the entire solar year without having * to placing 365 figures around the textile. | One of the more notable features of this representation of the , solar cycle is the place- ; ment of the double- sided figure 40 precise- ly at the midpoint of the calendrical cycle. This midpoint of the - solar year represents the June (winter) sol- stice in the southern hemisphere. The win- ter solstice is a tradi- tional period of cere- monial activity in the Andean region. Additional patterns around the circumfer- ence of the textile 49</page><page sequence="5">The central panel of this 2,000-year-old Peruvian textile contains 32 images of a bodiless rayed head that represents a mythical creature Andean scholars call the Oculate Being because of its large eyes. reveal the utilization of both sidereal and synodic lunar cycles in the calendrical system. The two remaining dou- ble-sided figures, 16 and 49, demarcate l^-month and four-month sidereal lunar intervals when a reverse calen- drical count is conducted on the textile. The emphasis of the four-month interval by means of the placement of a double-sided figure is particularly noteworthy, as the remaining 36 figures, numbers 50 through 85, on the tex- tile do not display sidereal-based patterning. "Y T That is significant about the four-month interval ' f' I and remaining days? Perhaps the textile is showing V V the relationship between the sidereal lunar year and the solar year. On the textile, the four-month lunar side- real interval represents the 12 sidereal lunar months; the remaining 36 days represent the time needed to correlate this sidereal lunar year with the solar year. Remember, there are 91 figures representing 364 days on the textile, not 365. Hence, the number of noncounting days displayed on the textile is 36 instead of 37. This patterning is similar in many respects to the Inka system described by Zuidema. Sidereal lunar intervals also are recognizable in the lower right, lower left, and upper left quadrants once reverse counts are conducted. In each instance, a reverse count yields IV2 sidereal lunar months (a period of 41 days). Each of these 41 -day intervals is associated with eight bodiless rayed heads in its respective quadrant on the central panel. This echoes the eight-day week used by the Inka, and some scholars have noted the use of an eight-day agricultural week on the coast of Peru in recent decades. The equal distribution of border figures in three of the four quadrants also is similar to the distribution of ceques in the Inka suyu system. The double-sided figure 1 6 on side A of the textile also demarcates the midpoint of a synodic lunar interval when a reverse count is conducted beginning from the textiles lower right corner. In addition, a three-month synodic lunar cycle encircles the textile. Its pattern follows a division of the roughly 29-day monthly synodic lunar cycles into peri- ods of time defined by the four major phases of the moon (new, first quarter, full, last quarter). The new moon to full moon phase lasts approximately 15 (7 + 8) days, while the full moon to new moon phase lasts approximately 14 days (7 + 7). This pattern is observable around the border of the textile, with calendrical counts falling on several figures (10, 24, 74, 81, 82) that are visually similar and at locations of foot-direction changes. A series of figures (2, 4, 5, 6, 7) also re-occur on side C (52, 54, 55, 58, 59) at an interval of IV2 synodic lunar months (six lunar phases), perhaps indicating the re-occurence of a ritual or ceremony. The textiles short sides (B and D) provide additional clues as to how the astronomical cycles were correlated into a single calendrical round. The positioning of a small butterfly-like creature (43), a recurring image in the three- month synodic lunar interval, as the last figure on side B of the textile identifies the remaining full-size images on that side as the 1 2 months in a synodic lunar year. The butter- fly represents the 1 1 additional days needed to incorporate the synodic lunar year (354 days) into the solar year. Side D of the textile contains 13 figures representing the 12 sidereal lunar months and the period needed to correlate this lunar cycle with the solar year. Two figures on side D are particularly suggestive of the astronomical phenomena that were utilized by these ancient people to regulate the calendrical round. The first image is of a small toad (1) from which a feline issuing plant material from its mouth emerges. Among Quechua Indians today, the toad is recognized in the overhead sky as ço Archaeology • March/April 2000</page><page sequence="6">a dark cloud constellation called Hanpatu. The constella- tion is at its highest point in the night sky just before the March (vernal) equinox and in the past may have been con- ceived as representing the approaching conclusion of the rainy season. This rainy season occurred in the highlands whose flowing rivers then descended to the arid south coast, providing vital water for irrigation agriculture. The second figure (82), which I believe represents the 36-day period in the sidereal system, contains two small human faces on the border band of the textile. These faces may represent the twin stars Alpha and Beta Centauri, which reach their highest point above the horizon during the period when the Pleiades are invisible. An artistic ele- ment positioned between the faces is similar to the eye on the figure of a llama, figure 26, on the textile. Again, taking our clues from modern Andean people, Alpha and Beta Centauri are referred to as llamacñawin (the eyes of the llama) in the highlands today. This llama is led by the small toadlike figure, just as the dark cloud constellation of the llama, known as Yacana, is led across the sky by that of Hanpatu, the toad. The llama constellation virtually fills the sky during the winter season. The short sides of the textile, which include the synod- ic and sidereal lunar cycles and the additional time need- ed to correlate these cycles with the solar year, also contain several pairs of nearly identical figures (42 and 80, 79 and 32, 89 and 35, and 85 and 41). The imagery of these pairs and their placement within the calendrical cycle suggest when agricultural fields were both prepared for planting (August/September) and harvested (April/May), and when the three deities represented by figures 38, 39, and 40 were venerated (June-August) for providing a bountiful crop. Analysis of the textile s imagery has provided an exciting glimpse into the ancient lifeways and sky watching activi- ties of south coast civilization. The Brooklyn Museum tex- tile is literally a fabric of time, with three astronomical cycles woven into a single yearly calendar. While the com- plete workings of this ancient calendar may never be fully determined, it is clear that the textile contains three of the components suggested for the later Inka calendar: the solar, sidereal lunar, and synodic lunar cycles. Analysis of the imagery on this textile also suggests that the Pleiades, the twin stars Alpha and Beta Centauri, and various dark- cloud constellations such as those of the llama and the toad were utilized in the calendrical round 2,000 years ago. Their survival into Inka times and the modern era is testi- mony to the enduring strength and coherence of native Andean society. ■ Darrell S.
