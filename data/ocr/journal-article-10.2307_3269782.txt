There is the evidence of a natural, romantic and free tradition, sometimes associated with the south, and that of a formal, classical and inhibited tradition, sometimes associated with the north. Of these two major traditions, that of the north came in time to predominate over that of the south. For it was in the north that China's political and dynastic authorities emerged, and from thence that they extended their sphere of influence to the east, and then to the centre and the south. While this extension may be seen most clearly in political terms, it also affected cultural developments. The regimes of the north required intellectual conformity and support; there set in a tendency whereby the temporal masters and officials of the north were wont to mould and exploit the independent arts and mythology of the south so as to satisfy their own immediate political needs; and in the course of such treatment some elements of the southern tradition became subject to scorn and even suppression. For students of Chinese mythology, this tendency has had the unfor- tunate result of overlaying some of the evidence of the natural urges of man with the purposeful creations of his intellect. From about the beginning of the Christian era, standardisation was affecting Chinese literature, both in the choice of the material that was sponsored for preservation and in the interpretations that were put on early writings in order to propagate orthodox beliefs. In studying early mythology, then, we must fasten on such evidence as preceded the move towards uniformity, and on that which survives from the live cultures of the 1 Of the many scholars who have written on this subject and associated topics, I am glad to single out three to whose writings I owe a special debt: Noel Barnard, of the Australian National University, Canberra; Chang Kwang-chih, of Cambridge, Massachusetts; and Hayashi Minao, of the Jinbun kagaku kenkyiijo, Kyoto. The account of hybrid forms which is presented here is intended as a summary only, from which all but the most important references have been ex- cluded.

We may consider the paintings made on neolithic potteries of perhaps the fourth millenium BC, and the far more elaborate patterns that adorn the bronzes of c. 1500 BC and later. The inscriptions made on bones and shells tell us something of the aspirations of early Chinese monarchs of the Shang-Yin period (traditionally 1766-1122 BC), and of the processes for consulting divine powers; but they carry little information that bears on the specific nature of those beliefs. Although some of China's literature may date back to c. iooo BC, the versions which we possess to-day must be carefully examined; for we must sift the grain from the chaff, rejecting the results of the subsequent editing that suited the needs of the imperial dynasties founded from 221 BC onwards. Luckily, evidence of a less orthodox frame of mind survives else- where, despite the efforts of the officials of the north to deprecate its importance. It derives from the once thriving cultures of the south, and is seen in the art motifs and literature that emanated from the valley of the Yangtse River and beyond. These areas encompassed a terrain that was very different from that of the north, giving rise to the characteristic rice cultivation, and including large regions of swamp, forest and mountain. Such lairs lay beyond the reach of the Chinese official, who tended to regard them as the home of the untutored barbarian. It is from the artistic creations of such peoples, who were free of the northern mandarins' discipline, that we may learn something of China's early mythologies. The Chinese believed in the existence and powers of a number of deities. Ti, or Shang Ti, or God on high, was venerated by the kings and possibly the peoples of Shang; he was conceived as a unity, probably in anthropomorphic terms; and he was thought to possess supreme powers over man and nature. The kings of Chou, who supplanted those of Shang from perhaps 1122 BC, believed in a different supreme deity, known as T'ien, or Heaven. T'ien may also have been con- ceived in human terms; and along with the institutions and moral examples ascribed to the kings of Chou, T'ien was adopted as an object of veneration by the imperial dynasties, who worshipped him right up to 191o. Both Ti and T'ien, it seems, existed on a higher plane than the Shen, or Holy Spirits. These were conceived in multi- plicity, often being attached to specific sites on earth. The holy spirits would respond to prayer, invocation or, if the occasion de-</page><page sequence="3">Man and Beast 99 manded, to exorcism. For they were capable of actions which could help or harm man; and they were conceived in animal, hybrid, semi- animal or semi-human form. Finally, account must be taken of the Kuei, the demons who originated as manifestations of deceased human beings. They too were capable of benefitting or injuring man; they responded to prophylactic observances by man, and their presence could be invoked by specialist intermediaries. That the holy spirits and demons existed on an inferior plane to that of Ti or T'ien is shown by references in literature in which they follow Ti in order of precedence or carry out behests at his command. 2 A number of changes may be discerned in the concepts of these deities. In the earlier stages, of the Shang-yin period (c. 1766-1122 BC), it was thought that the souls of the deceased ancestors of the kings shared the abode of Ti, and that they acted as intermediaries between Ti and the world of mankind. This office was also partly filled by mythological animals who served to link the two worlds. In later stages, i.e. during the early centuries of the first millenium BC, the importance of Ti had declined; his replacement by T'ien bore a number of social implications; and the veneration for the holy spirits may have been growing stronger. In addition, whereas hitherto it had been the souls of the deceased ancestors who had acted as inter- mediaries, from now on contact with sacred powers was effected by specialists drawn from the human, living world, who may variously be described as priests or shamans. This development was accompanied by a change of treatment in Chinese art, as may be seen principally in the decoration of bronze vessels. In the initial stages, from perhaps i6oo to 950, animals are shown in full vigour, whom man treats with affection, reverence or awe. They are creatures whose powers are all too manifest, and there is little room for human beings beside them save in a minor, sub- ordinate capacity. However, in the bronzes which may be dated from c. 900 BC, man is shown wielding strong powers with which he is capable of challenging, fighting and even conquering the animal world; for by now the animals are monsters which can harm man. 3 2 See Lii shih ch'un-ch'iu 9.3b, and Huai-nan-tzu (edition Huai-nan hung-lieh chi-chieh, Commercial Press, 1926; reprinted Taipei, 1969) 4.4a and 4.I2b. 3 For the different stages in the treatment of animals, see Chang Kwang-chih, Early Chinese Civilization: Anthropological Perspectives, Cambridge, Massa- chusetts, 1976, chapters 8 and 9.</page><page sequence="4">I00 Michael Loewe Similarly, in Chinese mythology, the all-powerful animals of the early stages yield place to the human hero, who is depicted possessing strength, courage and nobility with which to defeat the monsters who withstand him. Evidence for hybrid forms in Chinese art and mythology appears in objects and literature that date from the fifth or fourth centuries BC and later. Such evidence must be considered in full recognition that it had been preceded by earlier, formative stages of cultural growth, and that those stages had lasted for a millenium and longer. Two contradictory principles may possibly be discerned. The first was that of identification of man with the animal world. Tribal ancestries were traced to an animal; divination was conducted through the medium of animal bones and shells; and attempts were made to make a contact with the animal spirits of another world by means of physical assimilation (e.g., the consumption of an animal's flesh, or wearing part of an animal's fur or skin). The second principle which may be seen operating in the Chinese treatment of the animal world is that of euhemerisation, whereby the myths and gods of an earlier origin were transformed into beings of authentic history, and animal figures were portrayed in anthropomorphic terms. 4 The Shan-hai ching, or Classic of the Mountains and the Lakes, is a text which reflects the southern tradition. In those parts of the book that date from c. 4oo BC, we find a didactic, descriptive guide to the holy places and sacred mountains of China. As would-be pilgrims or travellers we may learn here of the location of those sites and of the rivers which lead us thither; of the abundance of flora and the mineral wealth to be found there; and of the animals known to populate such places, be they normal, freak or hybrid. Probably the text had been written in the first instance to explain the features of a very ancient set of paintings or drawings; and from this explanation we may learn not only of the bodily characteristics of these enimals but also of their cries, squeals or roars, and the consequences of consuming part of the animal's flesh or donning part of its skin or fur. Thus: 4 I use the term euhemerisation in this sense, in common with writers on Chinese mythology; see Derk Bodde 'Myths of Ancient China' (reprinted in Chun-shu Chang, The making of China: main themes in premodern Chinese History, Prentice-Hall Inc., New Jersey, 1975, p. 18).</page><page sequence="5">Man and Beast IOI 370 leagues further east lie the mountains of Hsi-yang, with considerable supplies of copper on the south and silver on the north side. There is an animal there whose body is like that of a horse, with a white head, stripes like those of a tiger, a red tail and a cry like that of a human singer. The beast is named the Lu-shu; and wearing a piece of its skin will result in the birth of children and grandchildren (see Shan-hai ching I.2a) Various results follow the consumption of flesh or wearing the fur of these and other animals who are to be encountered in the holy places. Fortunate consequences included a cure from disease, relief from fear or bewilderment; and in addition to personal blessings of the type just cited, the result could be no less than a general blessing of peace and stability. However, the results could sometimes be disastrous, such as the onset of floods or drought, mighty enough to strike down a whole province. Or else, incidents of state could ensue, such as would require a general call for military service, to the hardship of the population. On a few occasions such calamities could follow after no more than the sight of one of these strange creatures. These then are the beasts who may be encountered in the flesh on the holy mountains, and such are the results of assimilating to their persons. But our text also describes the shen, or holy spirits, known to reside in these sacred hills, and informs us how they may best be served and worshipped. Altogether there are some 400 spirits who are named and identified with particular sites, and all but some 8o are described in detail. In all cases they are hybrid in form, com- bining for example the features of bird and dragon, or horse and dragon, or swine and snake. In a very large number of cases the holy spirits are endowed with a human face, surmounting an animal's body, be it dragon, horse or ox, sheep, snake, bird or pig. We may read in our guide book: In the third stage, south, there is a total of 14 Mountains, stretching for 6530 leagues, from Mount T'ien-yii to Mount Nan-yii. The spirits of those hills all have dragon's bodies with human faces; they may be worshipped with the sacrifice of a white dog and with prayer, and with rice used for the offering in grain (see Shan-hai ching I.IIa) or else: In the third stage, east, there is a total of g mountains, stretching for 69oo leagues, from Mount Shih-hu to Mount Wu-kao. The holy spirits of those hills all have human bodies with ram's horns; they may be worshipped with the sacrifice of a ram and with millet. Disaster brought about by</page><page sequence="6">102 Michael Loewe wind, rain or flood follows the sight of this holy spirit (see Shan-hai ching 4.7b) In evidence of this type it would seem that the Chinese were clothing in human garb those gods whom they first conceived in animal form. This process is paralleled by the euhemerisation of Chinese myth, and may perhaps be seen in the next subject to be considered. In 1934 grave-robbers who were active near Ch'ang-sha, south of the Yangtse River, lighted on the earliest piece of consecutive writing known in China other than inscriptions made on oracular bones, sacred bronze vessels or a few stone stele. The find was that of the famous silk manuscript of Ch'u, which has suffered a somewhat chequered history since its discovery (see figure A). As a result it is only in the last decade or so that the results of professional examination have become available. 5 The silk manuscript, which may be dated at c. 400 BC, is written and illustrated in polychrome, with two major blocks of writing that run in opposite directions. The text is partly defective; it is subject to grave difficulties of palaeography and interpretation, and hardly any sentence may be read in entirety. However, thanks to the efforts of a number of scholars, it may be concluded that the manuscript gives an account of the creation of the orders of heaven and earth and of the emergence of natural processes such as the sequence of the seasons. It mentions the participation of the holy spirits and other deities in these processes; at one point it reflects the influence of the theory of the Five Phases that governed the cycle of creation, decay and rebirth. 6 The manuscript text is surrounded by twelve peripheral figures, for whose reconstruction we are largely indebted to Professor Barnard 5 The manuscript is at present in the custody of the Metropolitan Museum, New York; the most detailed study published to date is that of Noel Barnard, (I) Scientific Examination of an Ancient Chinese Document as a Prelude to Decipherment, Translation, and Historical Assessment - The Ch'u Silk Manuscript, and (2) The Ch'u Silk Manuscript - Translation and Commentary (Monographs on Far Eastern History nos. 4 and 5, 1972 and 1973; Australian National Uni- versity Canberra). The term 'Ch'u' is the name of a state which controlled parts of the Yangtse River valley in the centuries before 221 BC. 6 I.e., the theory of the wu hsing, sometimes rendered 'Five Elements' (see J.

Each one of the twelve figures is accompanied by a short caption and a descriptive notice of its character, powers and activities. No certain interpretation of the figures can yet be given. But from the considerations which follow it seems likely that they may represent twelve guardian gods or holy spirits, severally invested with powers of action for each of the twelve months. Alternatively they may represent twelve shamans or intermediaries, wearing masks and capable of communicating with such deities. Whatever the correct interpretation may be, it seems likely that the twelve figures form important evidence in the history of worship and exorcism in China. The descriptive notices of four of the figures (nos. 2, 5, 8 and i 1) associate them specifically with the months or the seasons; and the forms of these strange creatures is such that they invite comparison with some of the hybrids who are mentioned in the Classic of the Mountains and the Lakes. Thus no. 7, with its human body and three heads, and no. io, with its dragon head and bird's body, might easily fit the descriptions of spirits who are mentioned in that text. No. 5 with its square, human head surmounting a birdlike body, and no. 6, which is interpreted as a snake consisting of two entwined bodies and a single head, may be compared with the book's description of strange animals. In addition there are several possible, but not exact, compari- sons which may be drawn between passages in the book and no. 9, with its bird's body, human face and antlers. 7 Both from the text that is under consideration and the unique silk manuscript it is possible to trace features that are generally and almost universally associated with shamanistic practice; e.g., assimilation with an animal's garb or guise; utterances made in the tongues of animals or birds; and dependence on trees for ascent to or descent from another world. This last feature may be seen clearly, and somewhat regularly, at the corners of the silk manuscript. In other literary passages we learn of the prevalence of shamanistic practice in south and central China, both for the period that is in question and for several centuries later. Of a number of shamans who are named in the Classic of the Mountains and the Lakes, one, called 'Hsien', 'grasps a green snake in his right hand and a red snake in his left hand'. This is at the summit of Mount 7 For no. 5, see Shan-hai ching 5.26a; for no. 6, ibid., 3.7a; for no. 7, ibid., 5.23a; for no. 9, ibid., I.Iob, 2.5a, 4.6a, 5.6a, and 5.27b; and for no.

In another text that derived from the south we have accounts of the shaman's work in restraining the souls of the deceased from leaving earth for ever, and in inducing them to return so as to enliven what is apparently a corpse; 8 and elsewhere we may read of the shaman's use of grain and straw to effect a cure or to expel evil. 9 The twelve figures of the silk manuscript, including some hybrids, may thus perhaps be taken to represent twelve spirits, or twelve shamans able to contact them and to drive away evil influences. The suggestion compels us to take a brief look at what may be said of the practice of exorcism in China. Probably the most clear evidence, albeit for some 500 years later than the time of the silk manuscript, is that of a description of a ceremony held at the imperial court; this was the Great Exorcism, practised for the emperors of the Eastern Han dynasty (AD 25-220), and probably stretching back to considerably earlier beginnings. 10 At this ceremony the chief exorcist of state performed the main rites. He was clothed in a bearskin which was furnished with four eyes, presumably to ensure that it could command all-round vision. The object of the ceremony is defined as being the expulsion of pestilence and evil demons from home, court and palace; and the climax of the ceremony was reached in an invocation to twelve named spirits, who were summoned to devour the 'ten baleful in- fluences'. We therefore ask whether the twelve figures of the silk manuscript from Ch'u may be symbols of those twelve spirits who are defined by name for the ceremony of the Eastern Han court; or whether they may be the intermediaries sent to summon them. It may also be asked whether the twelve figures are prototypes of other series or creatures which appear at other stages of Chinese thought; e.g., the twelve divisions of the cosmos, the heavens or the day, who were later to be symbolised by twelve special animals; 11 or the twelve guardian 8 See the Chao hun and Ta chao poems in the Ch'u tz'u 9 and io (David Hawkes, Ch'u Tz'u The Songs of the South, Oxford, 1959, pp. ioif. and Iogf.) 9 Huai-nan-tzu 16.Iga. 10 For this ceremony, see Derk Bodde, Festivals in Classical China, Princeton and Hong Kong, 1975, PP. 75f. 11 For the duodenary series, see Needham, ibid., vol. 3 pp. 402f. The animals are used in their correct sequence to designate years as, e.g., "The year of the dragon".</page><page sequence="11">Man and Beast 107 00 0 I'/ie Ij~~;li I00 JVO Fig. C.

The possibility that the twelve peripheral creatures of the silk manuscript of Ch'u, including some that are hybrid, represent twelve protector figures gains support from other considerations. In a number of graves that are situated in the same part of central China there have been found a whole series of single hybrid figures carved in wood, and charac- terised by the combination of prominent antlers and a long, protruding tongue (see figure C). In the great variety of figures of this type, the one discovered at Ch'ang-t'ai-kuan is perhaps the most dramatic, being finished in a variety of colours, goggle-eyed, and with hands grasping a snake that is in process of being devoured. Further examples of these features are seen in the figures painted on the coffin lids at the famous grave no. I, of Ma-wang-tui. 13 Among the multiplicity of elf-like creatures, animals, birds and hybrids there are a number of examples of antlered human heads and snake-devouring monsters (see figure D). These are symbols which recur both within the Chinese cultural area and elsewhere. Thus in the cave of Trois Freres, the graves of Pazyrvk and on the Gundestrup bowl we may see an antlered head combined with the features of animals other than deer, in portrayals of religious practice, shamanistic rite or funeral service. The protruding tongue is seen in Egypt, in figures of the god Bes, in Etruscan art and in India. 14 Of these features, the antler has been interpreted as a symbol of superhuman authority, capable of warding off evil spirits and guaranteeing everlasting life; and the tongue, which appears some- times with spots or drops upon it, is explained as being protruded as an expression of hope and prayer for rain. The figure of the snake-devourer is seen at Ch'ang-t'ai-kuan and Ma-wang-tui, and it also appears in at least one literary context. This 12 For these series, see Bodde, ibid., pp. 9of. 13 This grave, which retained the incorrupt body of the countess of Tai, may be dated shortly after 168 BC. 14 For a study of these symbols, see A.

The poet describes T'u po, 'Lord of the Earth' as being 'Nine-coiled, with dreadful horns upon his forehead'. T'u po was known as the lord of the underworld, one of whose functions was to expel demons and to devour snakes, before they had a chance of consuming the body of a deceased person. 15 The suggestion that a connection may be traced between the practice of exorcism, the symbols of antler and tongue and the figure of the snake-devourer must remain speculative; and it may be considered in the light of no. 2 of the peripheral figures of the silk manuscript from Ch'u. The reconstruction and interpretation of this figure is subject to doubt; but it appears to carry a double crest or a pair of antlers; and it is described by some scholars as having a mouth with a divided tongue, by some as having a mouth that is engaged in devouring a serpent. Three other considerations or principles should be borne in mind in regard to the hybrid forms of early Chinese imagery: the belief in bodily transformation; the cults of immortality; and the composite figures of Chinese artists. The belief that it is possible for one living creature to be trans- formed into the shape of another is seen both in a grand way and in rationalist terms. In mythology we hear that Kun, father of Yii the Great who saved mankind from flood, was transformed into a turtle; in a scientific context, Wang Ch'ung, who was writing during the first century AD, seriously cites examples of frogs being transformed into quails, or sparrows into clams. 16 While there is no knowing how prevalent such a belief may have been, it is possible that the basic idea of transformation may have been present in the minds of some of the artists who fashioned hybrid creatures. The Chinese have entertained a number of notions of paradise and immortality. Many believed in the existence of the world of the hsien, or immortal beings, who could fly and roam at will throughout the 15 See Ch'u-tz'u 9.5a (Hawkes, ibid., p. 105). 16 See Wang Ch'ung, Lun-heng 2 (7), Huang Hui edition pp. 54f.

To undertake a journey through the empyrean and to achieve a life of eternity, a diet of jujubes or the juices distilled from jade was often prescribed; and talismans with particular features were usually buried with the dead. It is in such talismans that we may find a clue. Both the literary sources and the examples of early art give us examples of hybrids who are equipped to escort the dead on their journey. The Cherubim or Seraphim, or the Icarus, of the Chinese world are seen in two forms; either as combinations of a bird's body and a human face; or as a human figure at whose back wings have started to sprout. The concept of transformation from one animal form to another and the desire to acquire immortality are possibly seen together in one particular type of hybrid whose appearance is quite rare. This is the figure of a human head and body, with a serpentine coil in place of legs. 17 This appears at the apex of the famous painting from Ma- wang-tui, possibly representing the arrival of the soul at its final destination in paradise. The image is also seen in a stone relief of a Fig. E. The Queen Mother of the West, with suppliants; from a stone relief in Shantung (reproduced from Taha gakuha number 46, Kyoto, March 1974, p. 63, fig. 20) 17 This is to be distinguished from the pair of figures, each with a serpentine body surmounted by a human head, which represent Fu Hsi and Nii Kua.</page><page sequence="16">112 Michael Loewe later period; here there is a pair of suppliants who have apparently received their draft of the elixir from the Queen Mother of the West and are likewise being changed into immortal beings (see figure E). So far as is known, the image of transformation into serpentine forms as a means of achieving immortality does not appear in other cultures. The third principle to be borne in mind is that of the composite figure. In the earliest stages of Chinese art that are exemplified in the bronzes of the Shang-Yin period (1766-1122 BC) there are a number of instances where two or more animals are shown in close associa- tion, in their entirety. In the art of south or central China of c. 5oo BC there are a number of beautiful combinations of pairs of birds and animals, often snakes; these are sometimes fashioned so as to form a drum-stand (see figure F). But perhaps the most conspicuous example of all composites of this period is the lacquer screen from Wang-shan, of c. 400 BC; the 51 animals on the screen include three pairs of birds who are engaged in devouring snakes (see figure G, I). Composites of this type call to mind no. 3 of the peripheral figures of the silk manuscript from Ch'u. Difficult as this figure is to interpret for certain, it has been suggested that it is formed of a bird's body with a snake's head; and it may be asked whether a hybrid of this type may have developed from composite figures in which bird and snake are shown complete. It is also possible to look forward in time to the composite snake-cum-tortoise which makes its appearance in Chinese art from perhaps 50 BC or so. This image bears a cosmological signif- icance, being one of the four animals that signify four of the five directions, or four of the five phases of creation. The snake-cum- tortoise symbolises the north, the extreme point of Yin, the climax of the wintry season. 18 The heyday of the hybrid in Chinese art and literature may be placed in the fifth or fourth centuries BC; its home region seems to have 18 An important clue to the origin of this symbol which has yet to be ex- plained may perhaps be found in a series of paintings of a recently excavated tomb near Lo-yang, which may be dated between 86 and 49 B.C. Three of the four animals appear in the forms which are well known in the following century and later, i.e., the dragon (for the east), the bird (for the south) and the tiger (for the west). The fourth figure, for the north, is a composite of a sheep's head,? tiger's tail and wings, and this is accompanied by a further hybrid of a ?cat's face and body, wings and a single horn.

But before long China became unified under Ch'in, the first of the imperial dynasties, which was founded in 221 BC. Uniformity and standardisation were promoted in art, litera- ture and mythology. If the lively, vivid styles and the strange tales of the south were not entirely suppressed, there was a sufficiently strong impetus from the north to propagate other art forms; with the propagation of the 'Confucian' cosmology, shortly after Ioo BC, the attention of Chinese artists was directed to other symbols, as befitted the new and orthodox modes of thought. The snake-cum- tortoise, to which reference has been briefly made above, derived from just such developments. The hybrid creature fell out of fashion. When we meet him again, he does not spring live from an artists's intuitive imagination; he is a creature of a secondary order. It has been observed above that the extant text of the Classic of the Mountains and the Lakes probably originated as explanations which were intended to accompany a series of ancient paintings. By the Eastern Han period (AD 25-220), those paintings had long since perished, although the explanatory text sur- vived. We find that artists of the day were portraying creatures of fancy which may have been inspired by that text or which were intended to clarify it. Hybrids appeared once more, by now in stone reliefs, carved deliberately to illustrate concepts which were known second-hand, from literary sources; they perhaps lack the immediate appeal to the sub-conscious that is carried in some of the hybrids of an earlier age. These secondary versions of hybrids are seen most conspicuously in the sculpturs and reliefs of I-nan, which are dated variously in the third century and later (see figure G, 2). The ideas persist, in the human faced bird, who is seen in the company of two-headed birds or two-headed deer; or in the nine-headed monster K'ai-ming, who guarded the holy axis mundi of K'un-lun. These figures are not identified by explanatory labels which relate them specifically to the animals or animal-spirits of the Classic of the Mountains and the Lakes; but it is to such origins that they may be traced; and all credit is due to the contemporary Chinese artists who drew on such material at a time when official efforts were being made to counteract its spirit.

Artists provided a new set of illustrations; craftsmen cut the blocks, so that these could be printed for insertion with the text; and lest an ignorant reader should be perplexed, each one of the new illustrations bore its own descriptive caption, relating the illustration to the specific passage in the book. These were the vignettes of strange creatures and the groups of animals set within a landscape which were first cut in the seventeenth century and have been adopted by publishers ever since (see figure H). For the wheel has come full circle; the original depictions of the holy spirits believed to be attached to some of China's mountains had perforce been replaced by literary descriptions. With the passage of time, Chinese artists sought to recapture the concept of those gods. Separated as they were by centuries from the original beliefs, they had little first-hand devotional experience on which they could call. They have nonetheless succeeded in presenting posterity with woodcuts that are graceful, imaginative and vigorous.
