<plain_text><page sequence="1">Black Genesis. A Chronicle. By Samuel Gaillard Stoney and Gertrude Mathews Shelby. New York: The Ma anillan Company. 1930. In their prefatory discussion of The Family Tree of Gullah Folk Speech and Folk Tales the collectors and interpretors of these stories told by the negroes of the Low country of South Carolina have approached the subject with the spirit of the scholar and the humanist, and avoiding academic dullness have set forth with keen insight and kindly humor the character of the Gullah speech and the Gullah folk. "In this chronicle", they explain, "we have not given, nor have we intended to give, a scientific rendering of either folk-tales or dialect. To secure clarity we have modified the conventional orthography considerably." For this the reader will be grateful, for in the Gullah stories of Ambrose Gonzales and of Marcellus E. Whaley one has to resort frequently to the vocabulary at the back of the book, with consequent loss of inter est and appreciation. The title of Black Genesis suggests the quasi unity of the col lection, for these tales nearly all have as their theme the interpre tation of the creation stories of the Bible,?Creation, Adam and Eve, Abel an' de Gui?a Fowl, Cain an' He Goin's On. Thus this collection should have a special interest for those who have seen Green Pastures or have read Bradford's OV Man Adam an' His Chillun. Here we have some crude anthropomorphism, according to which God appears as a sort of master workman, pleased at first with his efforts, but seeming to find the task more and more difficult with each succeeding day. On the fourth and fifth days he made the beasts. "He fix 'em for lub one anudder, an' jus' roam roun' all day widout bodder 'bout nothin' but keepin' com pany. And he mek 'em so dey kin understan' widout word o' mout' betwix' 'em. De only word roun' 'bout is de Word o' God, which dey only needs ears for hear." But the beasts crowd un comfortably close around to see what God is going to make next</page><page sequence="2">500 The Sewanee Review and he then creates Br' Dog "to keep dem t'ing in dey place". And when God knocks off from work on the fifth day he whistles to Br' Dog and takes him along to the Big House in Heaven, where through Br' Dog's politeness and humble demeanor he wins God's favor, so that God gives him a mouth, without which all the beasts had been created. All the other beasts thereupon demand mouths and God commissions Br. Dog to do the job. Then the trouble begins. If any reader should be shocked at such a primitive interpreta tion of the sacred story, they should consult the early English miracle plays and Milton's Paradise Lost, especially the scene in which Eve serves luncheon to the angel and Adam, while Adam gravely inquires as to the physiological processes of digestion among angelic creatures. In none of these, nor in these negro folk tales, is there any intentional irreverence, for the God of these simple, child-like black folk is a powerful yet kindly figure, regard ing his creatures with paternal solicitude and even a sense of humor, as a father regards his spoiled children. With something of the ironic humor that breathes through the Old Testament stories, God, to relieve himself of the pestering beasts who clamor for mouths like that of the dog, declares, "All right, my frien's ! I mek you widout mout' for sabe you a whole lot o' bodder. But I reckin de bes' I kin do now is gi' mout' to you, an' learn you not to ax for too much." Having acquired mouths, they worked their jaws constantly in shouting and talking their own kind of talk, so that they became hungry and having once got the notion of biting for food, they learned to bite one another. Then the little "skee-wee bug an' t'ing" began to bite the "big creeters", who suffered untold agony. Finally the Sarpint, who had already begun to work his wicked wiles, suggested that they ask God for tails with which to drive off the insect pests. "He sic' 'em a-pupose 'cause he reckin God aint goin' to like dat right now." And so the dog was commissioned to furnish them all with tails, and he made a mess of it for some of the beasts, for he could not satisfy all their demands. Even Adam and Eve have tails, for these stories appear to have caught by reflection some of the con tagion of evolutionary ideas.</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Soi In the temptation scene the Sarpint wins Miss Eve through his subtle flattery so that though she declares, "You mek me too bex wid you", she nevertheless "jus' kind o' giggle an' cast she eye down" and finally plucks an apple, consoling herself with the be lief that with so many left on the tree God will surely not miss this single one. There are few more dramatic scenes in the book than that in which God, having discovered the loss of the apple, makes his voice thunder through the garden, while all the creatures tremble and hide and Adam and Eve crawl under a "hebby fig tree and squinch deyself up side by side an' pull a lot o' dead leaf ober dem for kibber dem up." The story ends with the broadest kind of farce, God chasing them frantically through the Garden and finally cutting off their tails as they scramble desperately over the fence. The account of the quarrel between Cain and Abel is told with grim realism but with touches of true pathos, as when Eve "jus' t'row sheself down in de dus' by Abel, an' cry an' moan, an' cry an' moan". "An' Adam jus' moaned, 0, Lord, both o' me sons is gone now." Even more interesting and enjoyable, perhaps, are the stories of the animals,?Br' Rabbit, Br' Wolf, Br' Guinea Fowl, Br' Jay Bird, Br' Frog, and Sis' Nanny Goat,?-all of whom act in char acter, with the Rabbit, as usual, playing the part of the picaresque hero as in Uncle Remus, but in the end getting his just deserts at the hands of God. "All these stories," declare the collectors, "have some foundation of tradition. Several have been handed down for generations by family negroes. Two stand practically as originally told. For them all* we have tried to make our fictional development fill in the action and setting that the embodied beliefs or themes of these stories deserve." They have succeeded admirably in their purpose and have made a genuine contribution to the folk-lore and to the folk-tales of our country, presenting them in such clear, attractive fashion that any reader in any part of the country can understand and enjoy them.</page><page sequence="4">502 The Sewanee Review Martha Bensley Bru?re has caught successfully the fantastic humor of these tales and her silhouette illustrations add greatly to the charm of the book.
