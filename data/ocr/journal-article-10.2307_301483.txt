BOYLE, THE CHAONIAN DOVE: STUDIES IN THE ECLOGUES, GEORGICS, AND AENEID OF VIRGIL (Mnemosyne, supp. xciv). Leiden: Brill, I 986. Pp. xi+ I 96. ISBN 90-04-07672-7. Oliver Lyne's book starts by drawing a fundamental distinction between the conventional and objective 'epic voice' and 'further voices', elements which 'add to, comment upon, question, and occasionally subvert the implications of the epic voice' (2). While few would deny that the Aeneid is a poem which invites the reader to delve below its surface for subtleties, not all might consider L.'s distinction easy to apply: the poet is author of all the 'voices', and his work the product of their often indistinguishable blend. In his last chapter L. admits this basic difficulty, answering it with the notion of a sliding scale: further voices use the same means as the epic voice (invention, arrangement and style), but present a more unexpected or surprising attitude (236-7). One might reply that the mere enterprise of writing a Homericizing epic in a sophisticated age itself naturally leads to an ironic and 'distanced' approach to its material, even in the 'epic voice'. However, enough of theory. The real value of the book lies, as the author rightly claims, 'in the practical exegetical value of its examples' (3), and L.'s characteristic, probing, practical criticism is here impressively displayed. The first chapter of 'Examples Various' starts with two convincing ones: the use of the epic and tragic Ajax to characterize Aeneas, and the linked eroticization of Amata and Dido</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS AND NOTICES OF PUBLICATIONS 235 (4-I2, I3-27). Here one might add to p. I5 n. 29 the possible familiarity of Amata's name from its use by the Vestals (cf. Gellius i. I2. I4), and to 24 ff. the association of the top with Dionysus the child-god (cf. G. Hirst, CQ 3I (I937), 65-6), which in fact opposes L.'s suggestion that Amata's first stage of madness has no Bacchic aspect. At 20 ff. occurs the characteristic danger in practical criticism of Virgil, the over-working of a phrase or allusion: 'exuviae' in Aeneid 4 is best explained not as a military metaphor but by comparison with Ecl. 8. 9I (I find a similar over-working of 'vomens ignis' at 27 ff.-cf. rather Lucretius I. 724). However, most of L.'s examples of subtle under-currents in the text are good ones, including a fine account of the Venus and Vulcan scene (38-44), of the characterization of Dido by suttee (48-9) and of that of Juno, Priam and Hecuba by diction (49-55). The second chapter on the gods is perhaps the most significant of the book: L. rightly stresses (with others, esp. Camps and Quinn) the continuity with the anthropomorphic gods of Homer (6i-6) and the matching levels of human and divine causation ('working with'-66-7I). Crucial is his account of Jupiter's dual role as fate and as a character of deceits and weaknesses, a pleasing antidote to the usual providential Stoicism (7I-99) and containing much good analysis (e.g. of Aen. I. 254 ff., I2. 833 ff., IO. I04 ff. (here he might have cited E. L. Harrison, ANRW 3I. i (98o), 389-90) and of the use of the Fury at the end of the poem). The third chapter on allusion, after a good definition of the concept for Virgil, also contains much material of note: revealing and disturbing contrasts between Aeneas and his models Odysseus and Achilles (I04-I3), good accounts of the operation of Homeric contexts in Lavinia's blush (cf. also L. in G&amp;R 30 (I983), 55-64) and in Aeneas' appearance as Apollo (I 4-25), and of the links between Turnus and Diomedes (I32-8). Less convincing (though no less suggestive) are the Aeneas/Dido/Medea link (I25 ff.; the verbal echo of Dido reflects the unity of the passions in Virgil rather than the curse), the supposed allusion to Diomedes' horses at 7. 280 ff. ( 38-9 ff.; the chariot is a traditional heroic present), and the link of Juturna with Procne (I39-44; 'sonat' at I2. 477 picks up 'vocem' at 472, not this story). Nuggets of gold occur en passant, e.g. I36 n. 57 (Dido and Camilla) and I39-40 (implicit myth). The stimulating fourth chapter presents us with a bleak Aeneas, negatively characterized by frigid relations with others, shown by 'cut-off' in conversation (I45 ff.-cf. Heinze) and emotional inadequacy until too late a stage (I67 ff., I77 ff.-a well-observed point), plausibly linked with Aeneas' 'dehumanized' role as the vehicle of destiny. L. regards this as a culpable fault in Aeneas as events rush by him, but one might equally take a more sympathetic view, that this loss is the personal cost of a national future. His view of the Aeneas/Ascanius relationship (I89 ff.) and of Ascanius himself (I93 ff.) might similarly seem too dark: 2. 723-4 shows touching confidence, and i. 643 ff., 4. 6i6, 9. 649, I2. II0 ff. and I2. 433 ff. are not to be lightly dismissed as evidence of paternal care, while at least on one level the reader approves of Ascanius' killing of the unpleasant boaster (cf. 9. 595-7) Numanus Remulus, commended by the divine praise of the Augustan Apollo. As L. claims, Ascanius' archery does pick up the disastrous hunting-motif (both literal and metaphorical) of Book 4, but the innocent pastime of the boy differs from the predatory act of the man. After a brief section on dramatic irony (good on 8. 730 and 6. 847 ff., less convincing on 2. 355 ff. and 2. 379 ff.), the last chapter stresses the theoretical framework. Here one might again diverge: it is not clear that Virgil wishes to disassociate the creating poet from the poem to achieve 'objective' credibility for his narrative (2i9-20)-in fact he seems consciously intent on authorial self-presentation in his 'subjective' style and pathetic interventions, far more so than Homer. In sum, however, this is a valuable and perpetually provoking book, reviving some sound older views and contributing much of novelty, and will be essential reading for Virgilians. A. J. Boyle's book is more ambitious than L.'s, but to the reviewer achieves less. Its fundamental idea, expressed in its title (a reference to Ecl. 9. I2-I3), is that Virgil's works, taken as a whole, are concerned with the inability of art to affect the violent and perverted world of real society and politics; the poet is thus deeply pessimistic. This is presented in an introduction (I-I4) as a radical re-interpretation, based on an analytical reading, and supplanting previous misreadings of all three Virgilian works; B. rejects the traditional assessment of each work in its own genre and against the background of history, in favour of 'holistic scrutiny of the oeuvre' (I3). Thus we get an Eclogues with little about land- confiscation or Theocritus (i5-35), a Georgics with little about the civil wars (36-84), and an Aeneid with little historical context, no praise of Augustus (8. 678 ff. is seen as a sinister portrait at 93, the symbolically-placed eulogies of Books i and 6 ignored), and very little concerned with Homer (85-I76). After some not unfamiliar remarks on the contrast of rustic idyll and urban greed and violence, together with an uncalled-for elevation of Hesiod as the master-poet in these pastoral poems and an odd stress on the song of Silenus as the evocation</page><page sequence="3">236 REVIEWS AND NOTICES OF PUBLICATIONS of a pre-lapsarian idyll, B. concludes that the eventually trivial 'echoic' role of the arts in the Eclogues stresses the inefficacy of the poet in the real world. The Georgics, after the (again familiar) comparison between the farmer and the human moral predicament and an interesting analysis of the alternating moods of the individual books, are seen as a 'conjunction of eulogy and pessimism' (78), with a structure supporting a positive view which nevertheless contrives to cast a negative light on Rome through the poet's underlying ambivalence. These views are difficult for the reviewer to agree with, as are the frequently over-imaginative interpretations of text which support them, and equally difficult to see as central keys to Virgil's poetry. However, the notions of ambivalence and pessimism are more familiar in recent criticism of the Aeneid, and B.'s two chapters on the epic (85-I76, the second chapter largely on Aeneid 6) arouse greater interest. Here the thesis is that the ideological vision inspiring Aeneas characteristically fails him in practice, causing suffering and tragedy and symbolizing the lot of mankind in a harsh world: pietas in action turns all too often into furor, and neither the prospect of fame nor that of the collective success of future empire can compensate for the tragic suffering of individuals. This pessimism has some truth in the Aeneid, but B. seems to exclude almost all the positive aspect of the poem: nothing about the surely complimentary comparison between Aeneas and Augustus (and indeed the divine Hercules), nothing about the future glories of Roman history so proudly paraded in books 5, 6 and 8. His negative and ironic view contains some good points (parallel imagery for Dido and Turnus-ioi n. 29; deer imagery-I24ff.; Turnus' tower-iio), but its methods and arguments may be strongly questioned. Some examples. Simplistic imagism abounds: thus fire is always destructive and linked withfuror (I27, etc.; but it can be strongly auspicious and is often ambiguous-cf. 2. 679 ff., 8. 678 ff., IO. 270 ff. and especially Virgil's own explicit ambivalence at 7. 79-80), and gold is associated both with the 'gleam of glory' in empire (I65) and the destruction it brings (I4I). Unconvincing too is the Putnamite over-reliance on repeated words and phrases (so 'condit' at I2. 955 (I I I) iS supposed to recall the different use of 'condere' in the proem of the poem (I. 5, 33), 'geminus' (I45, i66) to signify evil, 'umbra' in the last line of the poem (I74-5) to recall the 'umbra' of the fourth and last lines of the Eclogues, 'cunctari' anywhere at all in the poem (I68) to represent opposition to fate). The notion of pietas used seems inadequate; it does not include such things as family feeling for Anchises or obligations to Pallas and Evander, seen as self-indulgence on Aeneas' part. Little reference is made to the gods, seen here as psychologi- cal symbols (I74): one might expect Juno (not to mention destiny) to play a larger role in a dark view of the Aeneid. Odd interpretations thus arise: the laudation of Nisus and Euryalus is ironic (89 ff.), Aeneas himself is the 'alius Achilles' of 6. 89 (I 54; but cf. 'tibi' in 6. 88 and also 9. 742), both Anchises and the Sibyl are trying to keep Aeneas from the contemplation of suffering in the Underworld (I 46 ff.), and the mistletoe simile for the Golden Bough reflects the parasitic nature of fame (I 64 ff.; no reference to folk-lore, cult or mysteries). There are also some interesting views, questionable but suggestive: the Gates of Sleep suggest that the ideology given by Anchises to Aeneas 'will...find little verification in experience' (I45), while the resistance of the Golden Bough to Aeneas reflects 'the opposition of the natural world of pastoral Italy to the "civilizing" forces of empire and history' (I67). In sum, the book contains some provoking views and some interesting material, but few will finish it convinced of its major theses or of all its analytical interpretations.
