<plain_text><page sequence="1">Just Look at That Post-Colonial Shuffle! Mustapha Marrouchi My material?my past, separated from me by place as well?was fixed and, like childhood itself, complete; it couldn't be added to. The way of writing consumed it. (VS. Naipaul, Reading and Writing, 28) The West Indian novel in English goes back a long way, at least to C.L.R. James, who flourished from the 1930s to the 1980s of the last century (Selvon 1989, ch. 1; sandhu 2004). The achievements of Jamaica Kincaid, Caryl Phillips, and David Dabydeen, not to mention Sam Selvon, George Lamming, and VS. Naipaul before them, now at work suggest that it still thrives despite the opposition view that modern West Indian writers should not write in English. The Caribbean Islands have a great many lan guages and English could be thought of as just one more of them, but that argument will not wholly suffice, for the loyalty of these writers is not merely linguistic. Their alle giance is to the English novel of the 19th century tradition, and their work has little in Mustapha Marrouchi is writing a book on Islams and Wests, at Cross-purposes. He teaches English at LSU.</page><page sequence="2">2 College Literature 34.3 [Summer 2007] common with deviant strains, whether of Modernism or Postmodern Magic Realism, or of such mid-20th-century experimental styles as the nouveau roman. Indeed they testify to the power, or if you prefer, the inertia, of that great central tradition (Stephens 2005, 45-46). The majority of them, rather like the great immigr? artists whom early 20th-century England attracted, were cosmopolitan enough to cast a quizzical eye on Western assumptions. They, like their predecessors, are to be admired for their normativity, not their eccentricity. Even so, the doctrine of art as a disinterested equilibrium of the soul, tempering disruptively partisan interests by balancing them with their opposites, runs back through Joyce to James. But it must now be put on a new scientific basis, given the way that modern life, with its brittleness of response, noisy disruptions, and impoverishment of experience, has thrown us out of kilter. Culture, however, is not at all as serenely disinterested as it appears. For Kincaid and the rest of the Caribou tribe a contemplative aes thetic wholeness has had to translate itself urgently into social action, not least if it is itself to survive; yet the inevitable partisanship of social action would seem to betray the harmony of being which it was meant to realize. On this view, the beauty of their case is that the local color is part and par cel of the disinterestedness, so that they can avoid aestheticism and instru mentalism at the same time. For Kincaid in particular, by being, like the ideal poem, ends in ourselves, we will be all the more instrumental in serving the cause of freedom, equality, and social justice.1 It once mattered that there was to be a major technological revolution in the art of the novel, but it did not happen; even James Joyce did not cause one. Prejudice against extreme forms of doing has persisted, and these seduc tive and subversive West Indian writers have acceded to it. This may be why, with the help of certain post-Imperial nostalgia (Naipaul) or anger (Kincaid), they are so much admired in Britain and the rest of the world. One of the first Booker prize winners included a novel by a West Indian writer, or, fail ing the Caribbean, other parts of the old Empire.2 Of the thirty four or so winners of the prize to date, fewer than half are native?the rest are either Indian or West Indians, with a few African, Canadian, and Australian laure ates (English 2005, 323-34). And even they tend to prefer solidity to fire works. It is in this sense that "solid" is a description that comes to mind (but it turns out to need qualification) when one is reading Jamaica Kincaid. The half-dozen novels she has so far written are all crisp, unhurried, and atopos in the Barthesian sense of the word (Barthes 2005, 78). They contain a good number of characters, all kited out with characteristics, attitudes, foibles, and broken families to quarrel with or leave behind in their quest for freedom and a better life. They are domestic persons with private causes for pain or anxiety or displacement but they are also subjected to the savage wear and</page><page sequence="3">Mustapha Marrouchi 3 tear of life under duress, dispossession, and the violence of fate. The novels contain many accidents?the action of The Autobiography of My Mother, for example, has its origin in one.3 The other novels contain unfortunates who, mostly as a result of fateful accidents, are, as Kincaid put it, "in pitiful pursuit of ambulation"; or who stumble, fall off, and are crushed by the collapse of their own destiny, beaten up by slavery or, when unwillingly undergoing some sort of transformation as required by their predicament, carelessly or viciously castrated.4 Considering their ill luck their calm is remarkable. If writing is important, it is because it represents the subtlest, most eco nomical organization of human impulses there is. Kincaid can thus practice her value of organization and state of mind in shaping what she calls "demi goddesses in search of a fine balance" (Bonetti 1992,12). Such an exercise is healthy in that it tends to reduce waste and frustration. After all, this is a nar rative where the family unit remains firmly at the center of the action. To understand how despair functions is not, she insists, the same as under standing how life works. Ambiguity is among other things a coded sort of anti-chauvinism. To be hospitable to different meanings is to be open to a diversity of cultures. Such an attitude toward life and writing is manifested in her concentration on the scale of unresolved perplexities, still lodged at the center of her project. This technique (if one calls it that) induces the reader to take stock of the deterioration of everybody under the threat of poverty, including the children and the steady draining of the modest happiness the "good people" around her main protagonist, Xuela, in The Autobiography of My Mother, had enjoyed back home in Antigua when she was a child grow ing up there. Such atrophy is matched by the increasing impossibility of finding any space in a grossly overcrowded locale. All around are noise and poverty. Men scratch a living from such trades as letter-writing, bone-set ting, hair-collecting, and earwax-removing, all chronicled quite in the spirit of Mayhew. "Let's all have some piss and quiet," says a minor character who is conscientiously identified by his inability to sort out English vowels (Kincaid 1997, 23). In the place where Xuela was born and went to school you have too much of the first and none of the second. The management of the story, the pressures of the place, of illness, and bad luck on these "decent people," is admirable. Kincaid describes what is pitiable without too much display of pity, and that prevents her reader from seeing the Caribbean house holds as versions of pastoral. Mr. Potter may be thought to lack the power and scope of The Autobiography of My Mother, a really drenching and therefore sus taining novel, which charts the downfall of one generation only to see the next one rise, has panoramic scope and variety. Kincaid is extremely good at the politics of the family but does not neglect major issues such as poverty, unhappiness, hunger, or slavery that have plagued her community for gener</page><page sequence="4">4 College Literature 34.3 [Summer 2007] ations. She is also perceptive on corruption, brutality, and selfishness that are in the atmosphere, and are able to invade quiet homes.This may sound undu ly dark, and it is high time to recall that Kincaid is a writer of great skill and resource?it shows in all the characterization, plot, and sub-plot in the care fully idiomatic dialogue. She can be extravagantly private as in the following instance where she recounts an intimate moment in which Xuela exhausts all her sexual energy in fucking Monsieur LaBatte, who may be advanced in years and "unbeautiful," but is crafty enough to leave an imprint. This is how she describes the encounter after he makes love to her for the first time: I wanted to see what I looked like, but I could not. I felt myself; my skin felt smooth, as if it has just been oiled and freshly polished. The place between my legs ached, my lips ached, my wrists ached; when he had not wanted me to touch him, he had placed his own large hands over my wrists and kept them pinned to the floor; when my cries had distracted him, he had clamped my lips shut with his mouth. It was through all the parts of my body that ached that I relived the deep pleasure I had just experienced. When I woke the next morning I did not feel I had slept at all; I felt as if I had only lost consciousness and I picked up where I had left off in my ache of pleasure. (Kincaid 1997, 72) One of the virtues of this kind of writing, which Roland Barthes aptly called the "dedication," by which he meant the episode of language which accom panies any amorous gift, whether real or projected; and, more generally, every gesture, whether actual or interior, by which the subject dedicates something to the loved being, in this case Xuela to her self, happens to be her Self, is the sheer exuberance by which the writer seeks to place love in an economy of pure expenditure (2005,34). Kincaid is fully aware of the transgression, which is possessed by a demon of language that impels her protagonist to feel or even injure herself. Such technique allows her to get so much into the narrative without its lapsing into the condition of the loose and baggy monster. Henry James, commenting on Arnold Bennett s Anna of the Five Towns, allowed that the author has put down "in dense unconfiised array, every fact required, to make the life of the Five Towns press upon us"; but that, he argues, is not enough, for soon we are saying: "Yes, yes, but is this all? These are the circumstances of interest... but where is the interest itself, where and what is the center?" (Lodge 2004, 56). A devout Jamesian might say the same of Kincaid s novels. The criticism would be unjust. Her narrative does have an interest beyond its "unconfiised array" of fact and character. She can write of a wall made dangerous and disgusting by men using it as a urinal, and pro voking a plague of mosquitoes. The wall is cleaned up, and a pavement artist hired to paint on it the gods of all relevant religions. Since men are no longer willing to take the risk of pissing on it, this solves the problem and also</page><page sequence="5">Mustapha Marrouchi 5 advances the professional skills of the artist. A doll won in a raffle is raped by a half-wit; a quilt, long in the making, always has a piece missing (Garis 1990, 3). There is imagination at work here, and there is interest. One might say that the interest begins on the first page of Lucy when Lucy leaves the home that never was. The world of which she is momentarily the center is full of hard facts that must be dealt with. Her combined force to "Ever try Ever fail. Never mind. Try again. Fail better" is stronger than the defenses of the fine unforced civility the people around her normally enjoy.5 The variety, virtue, and humor of lives led in defiance of these facts constitute the interest itself, and to represent them so fully is, like the work of the pavement artist, a work of art born out of a labor of love. Kincaid, who has lived in the US since 1967, has chosen to plunge her reader into the maelstrom of the Caribbean mess she left behind. This is a world refracted through the distorting lenses of distance and time, where realism, blended with a cold eye, and surrealism, mixed with sangfroid, col lide, often to disconcerting effect. Her thematic point of departure is simple: while her stories unfold against the wide screen of social change in the Caribbean, her characters seem to be against most things that are good, yet they have no reason to act the way they do-they express a kind of negative freedom. It is in the interstices of a multi-layered narrative that Kincaid reveals a genuine and considerable talent for answering back while at the same time forcing the reader to confront the simple question: is negative freedom the only freedom available to her protagonists and why do they suf fer from the void inside them, even though they still recognize the impor tance of telling their own stories? Since there is no consensus about what constitutes the hallmark of the orders of Empire, everyone is entitled to sup port or refute it while choosing his or her own ground. Her own position on this matter is clear: "History is full of great events," she informs us; "when the great events are said and done, there will always be someone, a little per son, unhappy, dissatisfied, discontented, not at home in her own skin, ready to stir up a whole new set of great events again" (1990,23). She, rather con servatively, locates herself about four or five feet from her characters and landscapes?near enough to tell us what we need to know about Lucy or Annie or Mr. Potter or Jack LaBatte or Antigua, but not so near as to infringe on their privacy or essential dignity. This is how Xuela reveals herself to the reader and the world: I came to feel that for my whole life I had been standing on a precipice, that my loss had made me vulnerable, hard, and helpless; on knowing this I became overwhelmed with sadness and shame and pity for myself. ... I loved the smell of the thin dirt behind my ears, the smell of my unwashed mouth, the smell that came between my legs, the smell in the pits of my</page><page sequence="6">6 College Literature 34.3 [Summer 2007] arms, the smell of my unwashed feet. Whatever about me caused offense, whatever was native to me, whatever I could not help and was not a moral failing?those things about me I loved with the fervor of the devoted.(Kincaid 1997,32-33) With a grim smile and a daunting accuracy, Kincaid shines her flashlight down into those unlit places of the Self where we rearm for our intimate wars with ourselves. In doing so, she chose to occupy once and for all the territory most favorable to her ambitions both as a storyteller and as a nov elist. In the process, she unveils not only Xuela but also her other characters, as if across the width of a farmhouse supper table, or from a distance equiv alent to that between one furrow and the next in a neatly ploughed field. A case in point is the portrait she draws of Mr. Potter: harsh, pitiless, even cruel but true and sincere (2002, 78). In this sense, Kincaid seems bent on forcing us to share the plight of the subject with a broken heart, the broken lineage, even though there is nothing broken or "barbaric" about her ?nonc? (utter ance). All this has a very complicated effect on the reading consciousness. The narrative offers surprise, delight, amusement, and fascination: it is spell binding and sometimes extraordinarily insistent on provocation and unpleas antries. On saying that a daffodil is not just a daffodil because of the way it was cultivated, who cultivated it and, who sweated over it? Why, then, does Kincaid, who writes as she speaks with an accent both lilting and melodic, feel it is her "duty to make everyone a little less happy?" (1990, 24) In fine, why this insistence on truth? Can we at all assume that the process of interpreta tion is fulfilled, or will it continue as new material comes to light? Is it a gold en rule of fiction that a writer like her cannot create a character whose way of noticing is significantly and emphatically less rich than her own? The prob lem always is: what colors and nuances to leave out, what tricks and twists of voice or consciousness to throw aside? These questions arise when reading Kincaid, who is increasingly fascinated by defeat, by the idea of the painful, by the incapacity to break down the boundary, the more successful she is. I The various interventions (whether speaking, writing, or teaching) by Jamaica Kincaid have the same theoretical underpinning: a modest extension of the argument made long ago by C.L.R. James in The Black Jacobins, pro posing that what we in fact call freedom is nothing but the "dream of an impossible fraternity" and that to "be truly independent," we must "cut [our selves] ... off from all symbols of colonialism and slavery" (1963,78). The call for total freedom that James evokes with passion in his play is laid out with clarity and precision in the Kincaidian oeuvre, which explains its ironically grandiose scope. Indeed, most of her novels deal in failure, and she herself, from early on, was alert to how dull insolvency in a novel looks compared to melodrama, say, or in the case of My Brother, tragedy of sorts, in which soli</page><page sequence="7">Mustapha Marrouchi 7 darity and unconditional love are proposed as a radical free-market solution, allowing family relations to achieve the same consumer satisfaction they have in the Global Mall where rich but ugly Westerners and the poor but hand some of the Third World share resources.6 This way of telling should there fore be worth looking into, especially in the case of Mr. Potter, always more reserved and elusive than it seems. I want therefore to consider the Kincaidian narrative in juxtaposition with that of her loss of national and possibly racial identity. Antigua and Antiguaness, it is said, hardly "exist" now except as a form of charlatanism, or a bane. Yet, just as this lament has its own moral counterpoise?what the individual does not find outside herself, she must find inside?so it offers a clue to certain of her aesthetic methods. In The Autobiography of my Mother, for example, uncertainty about Antigua and Antiguaness, and indeed about the whole characterization of individuals, can act more as a positive than a negative influence, and lead the attention to where the narrative has its real strength and character. Kincaid is concerned here, as she has mostly been (and as the whole novel genre has usually been, insofar as it is a social medium), with love (or lack of it) and friendship: the love, in this case, of men for women, and the friendship of men for men?and theoretically, too, the love of women for men, and the friendship of women for women. Wherever the story nominally takes place, the narra tive is constructed in a series of emotional confrontations as witness the fol lowing instance between Xuela and her teacher. This is tidily expressed by the protagonist in eloquent terms: [M]y teacher's reaction to my letters, those small scribblings, was a tonic one. She believed the "everybody" I referred to was herself, and only her self. She said my words were a lie, libelous, that she was ashamed of me, that she was not afraid of me. She said all this to me in front of the other pupils at my school. They thought I was humiliated and they felt joy seeing me brought so low. I did not feel humiliated at all. I felt something. I could see her teeth were crooked and yellow, and I wondered how they had got that way. Large half-moons of perspiration stained the underarms of her dress, and I wondered if when I became a woman I, too, would perspire so pro fusely and how it would smell. Behind her shoulder on the wall was a large female spider carrying its sac of eggs, and I wanted to reach out and crush it with the bare palm of my hand, because I wondered if it was the same kind of spider or a relative of the spider that had sucked saliva from the cor ner of my mouth the night before as I lay sleeping, leaving three small, painful bites. There was a drizzle of rain outside, I could hear the sound of it on the galvanized roof. (Kincaid 1997, 21) Although the plot concerns displacement, abuse, and longing, and the Antigua setting as Kincaid evokes it?a faded colonial distance?is therefore relevant, the style of the narrative is artless in contrast to the beautiful Xuela.</page><page sequence="8">8 College Literature 34.3 [Summer 2007] Artlessness fuses with the forms of selflessness, lack of egoism; it does not concentrate on the writer. Fantasy is safe when it knows itself to be fantasy, and the role of the imagination is to lead the way to the real-these are clas sic and dignified doctrines of the arts. But in Kincaid they recur with an edge to them, and even (when one considers the oppositions in her work-intel lectual exile, horrifying romance, destitute poverty) with a certain sound of conscious paradox. The story of "leaving home" in The Autobiography of My Mother is revealed to the reader in a more inward sense. In the course of the narrative the all-male and all-female drinking-bouts that pass for "social life" evolve into something closer to simple human loving-kindness, where human beings actually talk to each other. The relationship of parents to grown chil dren becomes important, and there is even, in the form of a nice puppy, a kind of surrogate grand-child: it too, in the farewell that acts as grand finale, has become an adult dog. The element of apparent circuitousness in this approach to Kincaid is perhaps excused by the nature of displacement itself. In this case, the writer's remarkable individuality may be defined so as to clar ify, however indirectly, her great and always in some sense reticent achieve ment. In her discriminating treatment of the issue that confronts her male and female characters, Kincaid indicates that the price has been too high. As a result, the form of her narrative is a demonstration of this conviction, for it is an account of an intellectual dilemma which takes shape as an autobiogra phy. She remembers her own experience as a child at home, where "[w]e all began in a garden, in paradise, and had to leave" (2000,1; Kincaid and Fischl 1986). The outcome was a divided consciousness, in which intellectual achievement had to be held distinct from the social behavior expected of a young woman. This cloven existence resulted in a disabling failure of confi dence which continues to be (as anyone involved in the teaching of girls will affirm) dispiritingly familiar as a pattern of response in women. At the cen ter of her narrative is a painful acknowledgment of the extent to which her characters have been reduced and degraded by the milieu in which they were born and grew up while leading half a life. And because the lifelikeness of the quasi-tragic treatment of the narrative leaves a trace of uncertainty just as it does as to whether it is indeed this blow of colonial history which most contributes to the collapse of the story, I shall limit my discussion of Kincaid to My Garden (Book), Lucy, The Autobiography of my Mother, and Mr. Potter. In these works the words have a power quite beyond the fiction, and may be said?in a double sense?to reflect on it. In her most characteristic narrative (I am thinking mainly of Mr. Potter) Kincaid is a writer whom one may hes itate to quote from because her style will tend to be so unintense, so unob trusive, so unrerewarding. There, the fiction rules over the natural and the</page><page sequence="9">Mustapha Marrouchi 9 real. It all gets swallowed up and turns into the same thing-and there is indeed something nightmarishly existential in it, or there would be without that critical purposiveness, that intellectual consciousness in the storyteller and the tale, which leads the way always back to light and air. What interests me in this new and fresh enough way of telling is the deliberate transition in her work always toward a kind of chosen return of the native who, like Ulysses, must keep the myth of resettlement alive. This when the imagination takes over, creating its own statement against the emptiness, summoning up plants in much the same way as a writer sum mons up words. Kincaid does both. The question that comes therefore to mind is: why does she do it? The answer may be found in the archaeology of the garden itself where everything seems perfect?just as the novel is in one's mind?and it is a dangerous temptation, this flirtation with perfection. Why? Simply because perfection is dull. And so is beauty. And Kincaid came from a place of beauty?Antigua. "Beautiful to the point where it dulled the sens es," Kincaid writes. "There is too little anxiety there to make you long for anything better. It made you forget about living." She knows about forget fulness too, that the reward of forgetfulness is complacence, which is just sub missiveness in another guise. "I know where I came from, I carry it around with me all the time, and I know how lucky I was to escape" (1998, x). It is in this sense that her narrative is anchored in a structure of reference and atti tude, which pulls off a rare and stunning feat: an oeuvre with a double life, a serious work of telling which also functions as a parable, a narrative that is, effectively and ironically, also a work that contains multitudes. Reading Kincaid this way, I found myself moving back and forth between three dif ferent selves, one Caribbean, the other American, and a third in between, that know not what compels them to write with a voice that is distinct and dense. Although the narrative in My Garden (Book) kicks off with a listless piece about wisteria, the reader is rewarded with smart-mouth observations on useless horticultural tools (she calls a trap for garden pests a "ridiculous panty-waist contraption") and highhanded seed sellers. Sprinkled among these observations are intriguing autobiographical tidbits about Kincaid her self. An example: "The standards of my past are marvelous for the people I left behind and anyone else wishing to join them. They are good standards, they are admirable standards, only they do not fit me anymore" (1999, 45). The writer only hints at what life is like for this particular black woman liv ing in the mostly white state of Vermont. "This is the evidence I have for my feelings," she observes, "but my own history contradicts this: I come from south (far south, I come from the West Indies)" (60). Nor does she even say precisely what her garden grows although she specifies that the</page><page sequence="10">10 College Literature 34.3 [Summer 2007] garden has a peculiar side to it, a qualifying side. For instance, most of the nations that have serious gardening cultures also have, or had, empires. You can't have this luxury of pleasure without somebody paying for it. This is nice to know. It's nice to know that when you sit down to enjoy a plate of strawberries, somebody got paid very little so that you could have your strawberries. It doesn't mean the strawberries will taste different, but it's nice to enjoy things less than we do. We enjoy things far too much, and it leads to incredible pain and suffering. (Kincaid 1997, 30) The force of this passage is unmistakable. For unlike Jane Austen, who in Mansfield Park sublimates the agonies of the Caribbean existence to a mere half dozen passing references to Antigua,7 Kincaid's novels express how we (the natives of the Southern Hemisphere) had previously been mocked for our deference and timidity, how we were too scared to look our oppressors in the eye when they spoke to us or show the pain felt by those of us oper ating from below. For Kincaid, what sustains the life of a colonial garden in Jamaica, say, is the laborers who maintain and assure the domestic tranquili ty and attractive harmony. It could not have been otherwise. Additionally, the garden could not have been possible without the Empire, the slave trade, and the colonial planter class. All this she leaves to her reader to supply in the way of literal explication. And that is what reading her against the grain entails. The whole notion of cultivation amuses her, she says. It is a very English thing, the garden as enclosure, the triumph of culture over nature. "In England, where you have so little space, the garden is always an attempt to tame, to assert control, to play God." But in America, where landscape is omnipresent, "like a big yawn that the land comes out of," it is harder, she adds, to deceive yourself (2000, 3). For Kincaid, the garden can be orderly, but it can also be in a constant state of rioting-something reminiscent of her own childhood. She was an introverted, bookish child, who did very well at school but sometimes had trouble getting on with other children. It is as if she was afflicted by existential angst even then: "Very early on in life, I was conscious of the futility of life," she writes, "of the difficulty of living" (Nasta 2004, 89). Or, to put it in psychoanalytic terms, Kincaid was mentally gifted, but emotionally unstable or subnormal. The human need for plants extends far beyond simple utilitarian require ments of food, clothing, and shelter?there is a yearning for them which is aesthetic, obsessive, sometimes religious. My Garden (Book) explores the nature of this more subtle relationship between the vegetable kingdom and ourselves. Kincaid approaches the subject of these "earthly delights" as an insider, a self-confessed gardener, one mindful of inherent danger in her attempt to understand the nature of obsession. She is quick to pass on orchids given to her by addicts in case she, too, comes under their spell. Why people</page><page sequence="11">Mustapha Marrouchi il avoid some plants and revere others is the subject of her book, a meticulous study of the ancient roots from which comparatively modern manifestations like orchidodelirium and tulipomania ultimately derive. The narrative is full of twists and turns. At first it seems as if it is going to be an analysis of the idea of the garden, but then something happens. Memory's smoky mirror, like the witch's crystal, or the burning glass of the Aztec god who demands human sacrifice, becomes the prime instrument turned on history. "By now I have been gardening for years," Kincaid reminds us "and memory, ephemeral, subject to things I hope not to understand, is for me an anchor. Walking around the garden, then, I am full of thoughts of doom, I am full of thoughts of life beyond my own imagining. I come inside" (1999, 61). Note here how the curious alternation of outside and inside follows the pattern of remembering and its opposite, forgetfulness. As the passage clearly shows, Kincaid is an obsessive gardener, having been through passionate affairs with lilies, tulips, and orchids before committing herself to wisteria and the impli cations of the English idea of the garden in colonized countries, she now centers her attention on taste, which in the public or cultural sense, is deemed to be the ability to distinguish without argumentative fuss between the beautiful and the ugly. Aesthetics and the criticism of art started by try ing to articulate reasons for preferring one thing to another?an improbable task, as if I could say why red wine is the only drink in life. Along with smell, taste is the most intimate of the senses, but it is generally considered (again with smell) inferior to sight and hearing as an instrument of sensory percep tion. "Taste," Denise Gigante writes, "has always ranked low on the philo sophical hierarchy of the senses as a means of ingress to the mind. Whereas sight and hearing allow for a proper representative distance from the object of contemplation (hence for the regulating principles of consciousness and morality), taste, like its closest cousin smell, is bound up with the chemical physiology of the body" (2005, 90). One would imagine that if any of the senses were to be extended, by analogy, to comment on painting and music, the chosen senses would be sight and hearing, but apparently not. Taste is chosen, I assume, because it entails, to begin with, a manifested preference for one flavor rather than another. And it is beyond argument: a first preference, if not a first principle. One could extend taste from flavors to landscapes in nature, forms in art, behaviors in citizens, and various social practices that come up for judgement. On this view, the value of taste lies in the gratifica tion of being what one is, what is right to be. But for Kincaid, taste is an explosion of language during which the subject manages to annul the loved object, say, a rosemary, under the volume of writing itself. It is in this sense that gradually, the expected body of garden writing that is also literature turns out to be more a study of the character of certain plants like the orchid</page><page sequence="12">12 College Literature 34.3 [Summer 2007] and magnolia than just simply writing about plants. The protean appearance of orchids is legendary. The destruction of wild orchids during the nine teenth and early twentieth centuries was part of the wider picture of colo nial savagery. Cemeteries in New Guinea and Burma were plundered and orchids growing on human remains shipped to London for auction still attached to skulls and bones: nothing, it seems, could stand in the way of an intrepid white hunter and his employer. Both in the glasshouse and in the marketplace, orchids inspired fervor and frenzy. Orchidodelirium reached its zenith in Victorian England, where it echoed the outbreak of Dutch tulipo mania in the 1630s.8 According to Kincaid, the tulip is destined to achieve Biblical status. Its history is intertwined with that of humans. It is a native of Central Asia, and like the nomadic hordes, swept westward from the steppes. Before invading Christendom it had captivated the Persians and Turks. The sultans of the Ottoman Empire, with an enthusiasm to rival that of any Victorian orchid fiend, sent their scouts far afield in search of tulips, and their aesthetic appre ciation was exemplified in their naming of the flowers. Names like Light of the Mind and Those that Burn the Heart are worlds removed from such modern varieties as Mickey Mouse and Hit Parade. The reign of Sultan Ahmed III (1703-30) is even known to historians as the Tulip Era: his extrav aganzas included sumptuous tulip festivals held in gardens illuminated by candles carried on the backs of wandering tortoises. The Sultan's passion brought about his downfall when his subjects became resentful of the inor dinate sums he was paying to Dutch dealers. By this time, the Dutch had recovered somewhat from their own tulip-induced financial vertigo (Goodwin 1986, 112-45). For Kincaid, taste in gardening, writing, or even cooking plays an essential role. They seem to have saved her. Her existence would have been nothing more than a tissue of sufferings.There is litde point in noting that there are many marked differences between the irrational fer vor provoked by the tulip and the rational behavior conveyed by the orchid, which take us once more back to Kincaid's childhood. Are these differences attributable to the patient prose of Kincaid or to the nature of the plants themselves-the elegant neatness of the tulip as against the ebullience of the orchid? It seems that the characteristics of the flowers attract people like Kincaid who share them. The Western cults of the orchid and tulip some times reached levels approaching religious fervor. In other parts of the world, plants have sometimes had a genuinely religious aura. Kincaid cites details from a colonial census of religious affiliations in the northwest provinces of British India. More than a thousand individuals refused to describe them selves as Hindus, Muslims or Sikhs, insisting that they were simply worshipers of tulsa, or holy basil (1996, 29). Tulsa was seen as the manifestation in the</page><page sequence="13">Mustapha Marrouchi 13 plant kingdom of the god Vishnu, and the tending of tulsa plants was more than a personal obsession; it was a religious duty. The plant has a reputation in ayurvedic medicine akin to that of ginseng in Chinese culture where the ginseng root is believed by the Chinese to be a panacea on account of its anthropomorphic qualities and was known in ancient times as "man-root." The same prestige has been accorded to the mandrake root, which has accu mulated a greater body of folklore than any other plant in Europe or the Near East. Its aphrodisiac reputation goes back to Biblical times and still sur vives in rural areas of the Mediterranean. As the tulip and orchid were later to do, mandrakes changed hands for large sums of money and there was a thriving industry in counterfeit roots fashioned from bryony. But the man drake, unlike ginseng, its Chinese counterpart, also acquired a dark and sin ister aura, no doubt on account of the psychoactive and noxious alkaloids present through the plant. Kincaid maintains that the baleful reputation of the mandrake is not difficult to explain: the negative reputation of such apparently innocuous plants as onions, garlic, and black beans is more of a challenge to the gardener or anthropologist. Alliophobia, the irrational dread of garlic (and by extension onions and leeks), has a long history. Despite gar lic s high reputation in Western cuisine and as an ingredient of a healthy lifestyle, it has traditionally been associated with witchcraft and evil; and for Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists, with demons. Kincaid describes the aver sion to garlic in some brilliant detail, but we still do not know why the smell of it on the breath should be thought so repellant.10The taboo status of the black urd bean in India, or the fava bean among the ancient Pythagoreans, is another mystery that Kincaid tries to solve, this time with more success. The fava beans cultivated in the time of Pythagoras were also black and the ban on their consumption seems to date back to the prehistoric Indo-Europeans, for whom the color symbolized death and evil. In valuing her relationship with the chosen plants, Kincaid reminds us of Frederick Sander who, on his deathbed, wrote to a garden director: "This ill ness will be the end of me. Tell me, how are the plants I sent you? Are they still alive."11 Her addiction to embellishment is especially strange because the facts (not only of gardening) around her are extravagant enough: born into a family of modest parents, Kincaid developed a good ear for sounds and a good eye for the rare that are the envy of the art world. Yet swanning around New York City in jeans, she made people doubt what they should have believed and believe what they should have doubted. Because she reads peo ple as she reads the world, and because most of the people she encounters are taken by what she tells them, Jamaica Kincaid becomes at times a portrait of an entire world?fierce, incantatory, cutting, and articulate?that cannot stop talking back with a vengeance. And the great unemotional happiness with</page><page sequence="14">14 College Literature 34.3 [Summer 2007] which the voice speaks is hers.The daughter goes home, stilled by this incur sion, by the communique from the other country where she used to live. Though she does not block this in heavily?she has immense tact, and great wells of unsentimentality?we realize how mistaken the matron, who is con stantly gyrating on her own axis to cause a sensation, to find a sensation, has been. In the end, she needed someone both to run away from (her mother, colonialism, poverty) and to come back to (her brother and what used to be "home"). It is a measure of her flamboyance that she has already left an indelible mark: her writing is the discovery of her own mind, and her narra tive gives off the survivor's "[a]nd I only am left to tell thee." The figure that emerges is a deeply solitary soul, hiding behind her exaggerated performance but genuinely driven by a vision, and elusive, perhaps, even to herself. This profoundly contradictory vision is most powerfully figured in the movement between center and periphery, New York and Antigua, Self and Other. Lucy, Xuela, and Annie are literally broken up by the Empire, by its human and spatial variety. Like the uprooted plants Kincaid speaks about in My Garden (Book), they become entangled. The Empire is what holds them in place, and yet what flings them out of their place. But there again, Kincaid prefers move ment over stasis, New York over Antigua, even tulip over orchid. "I will be happy anyway seeing masses of tulips," she writes. "I love tulips" (1999,171). For her to be in place, to be securely at "home," is not an absolute good, because she atrophies; and equally, to be sent to the rim, to be on the move as in the case of her trip to the Himalaya to look for seeds to plant in her garden in Vermont, is not an absolute, transgressive good, because one may easily lose direction and wither into aimlessness. For Kincaid, to be under command is not safe; and to be free is no release. Her rootlessness is not an acknowledged yearning, from the prison of domination, for life outside. But that life does not really exist, and probably never has. The argument is further complicated by the fact that Kincaid has pub lished a substantial body of writing on culture in the U.S.?and more recent ly, Among Flowers, a travel narrative haunted by an irresistible stream of hor ticultural consciousness. These works often proceed in a pretty shuffle, as if each sentence were a new beginning. They have an air of discontinuity while being, in fact, neatly interlocking webs of images. The writing is essentially aphoristic, even when not obviously so, because each sentence attains the sta tus of aphorism, which Kincaid describes as "half-truth," and this might also stand as a description of metaphor, certainly of metaphor as it appears in her work, where the similes are both magically untrue and magically more than true. In doing so, she, in effect, novelizes the techniques of narrative, produc ing novels that behave as if they are always about to end, and which there fore always include one more phrase before the deferred closure. They are</page><page sequence="15">Mustapha Marrouchi 15 highly patterned, but each sentence is a discrete explosion. Additionally, they amply show how the writer can suggest intricate landscapes, actual or psy chological while rejecting a principally autobiographical interpretation, which brings to mind what Roland Barthes perceptively called "biographemes": crises, challenges, and complexities experienced by the writer in action (1990, 23). Yet as soon as we finish reading one novel by Kincaid, we feel impatient to go back to her strange, witty embrace and swirling, florid gravitas. And when we do, the ancient feline magic is instant ly revivified. Has there ever been any more delicious, free, and wickedly appealing rendering of the female adolescent psyche than some passages from The Autobiography of My Mother? Any more lavishly botanical rendering of what it is like to attend to a garden than the following passage: The narrative of the garden that I know begins in Eden, the Garden of Eden, and this garden, Eden, comes at the very end of creation, after Adam, before Eve, because she comes as a companion for Adam as he enjoys the garden, and so it is so shocking that her presence itself leads to his being deprived of his enjoyment_And in this narrative with which I am famil iar, this place called Eden is an ideal as a state of mind and an ideal as a place in which to Uve day after day after day; and Eden, in this text with which I am familiar, begins with pleasure and necessity, but then again the Tree of Life (which I think of as a vegetable garden, a need) comes before the Tree of Knowledge (which I think of as plants for which I have no immediate use and grow only for an interest that is peculiar to me, and so this is the part of the garden which carries me into the world). In any case, Eden is tilled and generally looked after so that it can yield physical nourishment before it becomes a danger to Adam's inner life. (Kincaid 1999, 221-22) As narrator, Kincaid keeps a discreet, dispassionate, retrospective distance. We might moon over such passages endlessly (and do) while waiting for life to begin.Yet perusing the book, I find my eye caught by the last paragraph. "I shall never have the garden I have in my mind, but that for me is the joy of it; certain things can never be realized and so all the more reason to attempt them. A garden, no matter how good it is, must never completely satisfy" (1999, 221). Faced with such perfect, lapidary, and truth-bearing sentences, our only appropriate response is to fall to our knees in surrender. About gar dens and gardening, Kincaid seems to say it all. The peculiar pleasure of pas sages like these exceeds the obvious glamour and sensuousness of the mate rial, or even the audacity of the similes. A farther jouissance (of the text) aris es from our sense, as in Tolstoy, that anything can be described, that nothing outstrips the writer s reach, and that the novelist is exulting in her own sov ereignty. This sovereignty of description gives the narrative a paradoxically old-fashioned and romantic air, as if she had learned what she needed of</page><page sequence="16">16 College Literature 34.3 [Summer 2007] postmodernist narrative techniques and then somehow transplanted herself, with this new information, back to the more undaunted modernist era. II When Kincaid began to write, in the mid-seventies, she was one of the first novelists belonging to the younger generation to act on the realization that narrative is not ideologically neutral, but a product of history, impreg nated with all sorts of subliminal cultural nuances. Realism, with its time honored ways of putting across a single point of view?the omniscient nar rator, an implied writer who is always authoritative, a reassuring degree of closure?is the narrative mode most strongly identified with the Western novel. Kincaid s narrative, on the other hand, follows from the insight that a novel aiming to make a point about the cultural arrogance of the colonizer cannot use realism as the vehicle for its critique of oppression without being undermined by its failure to challenge the conventions of the tradition it wishes to call into question.This statement should perhaps be qualified: "The problem of injustice is not black and white or, as I say, racial, it's about the powerful and the powerless_One longs for justice but it doesn't end with black people and white people kissing each other on the cheek; it's much more universal and complicated and simpler than that" (Kincaid, 1997, 337). But whatever the truth or otherwise of her claim about oppression, Kincaid's fiction is in many ways informed by an old-fashioned liberal humanist vision. It demonstrates clearly that absolute power over the Colonial Other (of the Other), power without pity, is always asserted at a great cost. A case in point is that of the unnatural fathers and/or colonizers the reader encounters in her narrative, who silence their children and/or subjects, and who will be silenced by them in return. It is what Freud aptly termed "la d?n?gation," a denial of sorts (1984, 34-35). In a joyful display of architexte, to borrow G?rard Genette's formula, Kincaid hands us the text where idiom can be learned, whereas observation, at which she excels, cannot. There is not a single page that does not boast, say, small, "meek" eyes, "vapid" eyes, the "florets" of a man's face, the "smell of manure," or "drizzly, woody, sodden-earthed England" (1991,91).The nar rative is a concertina, Antigua slowly squeezed toward Anglo, with intricate music in between. The so-called action does not rouse the reader half as much as the writer's epistemological riot, but one can see her yearning to resolve things, to bring them all together for the sake of neatness. This is nowhere more obvious than in her own life, which reads like a fairy tale or an American Cinderella story: born and raised in poverty on the island of Antigua, unloved by an unresponsive and often abusive mother who shipped her off to the U.S. at seventeen to be an au pair (Kincaid insists on the word</page><page sequence="17">Mustapha Marrouchi 17 "servant" to describe her employment status. In an interview with Marilyn Snell she explains that she thinks of her writing as part of her domestic life, which is odd because the solitariness of her narrators is itself a reminder that writing is a profoundly unmarried activity); "discovered" on the streets of Manhattan by New Yorker columnist George Trow, who brought her into the fold of the magazine by printing one of her articles in the "Talk of the Town" section; became a celebrated fiction writer and gardening columnist.12 Read the novelist as, a quarter of a century ago, Edward Said prepared himself and us to read Verdi's Aida, and Kincaid becomes one in that long line of writ ers?C.L.R. James, Morrison, Walcott?to whom madness is imputed so that the chance of hearing what they clearly say is muffled, and in that other lineage?Phillips, Chamoiseau, Glissant?whose radical sanity is masked by veils of assertion that they are lovely, folksy, romantic dreamers only This is perhaps the bravest lineage in post-colonial English literature today: and Kincaid, emerging now as a major post-colonial writer, does it real honor. The themes of expatriation and master-slave relationships are probably unavoidable for a writer such as Kincaid, who, unlike David Dabydeen who left Guyana for England, left her native Aantigua on a boat headed not for Southampton but for New York, the exilic city par excellence. Up until then, her life was outwardly uneventful. Up until then, she also felt out of place. But now, tall, seemingly weighing nothing at all in her ballet slippers, she has a lightness of foot and manner to put one in mind, immediately, of a child. It is clear from the narrative that she was repelled by her mother s life, drained of personal energy by childbearing and household duties. Yet even in her most allusive writing, Kincaid usually gives the reader enough human and lyric interest to propel him or her through the tale. "Xuela," for instance, continues with her ambivalent indictment of writing, an activity symbolized by the perilous trade of the seaweed-gatherer but also by the desolate col lecting of "sea drift." It is in this sense that the biographical becomes a launching-pad for the autobiographical and thence to the general: the artic ulation of the impalpable, the writer implies, presents difficulties to everyone throughout daily life. But Kincaid is celebrated, I think, not so much for the imaginative gesturing toward past lives as for the registering of her own. In Mr. Potter, we are given the child's perspective of a life lived literally on the edge. The rush of enumeration?nouns and noun-phrases, repetitions and doublings is the way Kincaid chooses to sketch her environment: "During my early years in New York," she writes, "I . . . felt more at home with painters than with most literary people. .. . Not being able to draw, I found myself exploring what words could do as an equivalent to drawing and brush-work" (1991, 91). When description turns to the mixture of indigna tion and regret with which Kincaid paints her father, in the narrative, it is</page><page sequence="18">18 College Literature 34.3 [Summer 2007] past participles that bear the burden of parental life. Finally, in the wake of the heaped-up inventories, comes the indictment of the anonymous biolog ical life women have been destined to; and here at last her syntax ignites into a whole sentence, as she asks how women relinquished the notion that they had a right to a soul, a thread of fire, a personal identity. In terms of stereotypes, the narrative looks like a post-colonial rather than postmodern piece of art?subtle and savage, feminine and earth-bound rather than dreamy, spiritual, and involuted. Kincaid evidently began translat ing the landscape of her background at the same time as she was first exposed to the unmoored speech of contemporary American narrative, and saw in it a kind of "aural antidote" to that stream of consciousness-a way of ensuring, as she put it in her extravagantly figurative prose, that her "linguistic anchor would stay lodged on the Anglo-Saxon sea-floor" (in Wachtel 1997,328-29). But it would be more accurate to see both the lyrical and melancholic in Kincaid as a fusion of both registers, which brings us closer to the source of fascination for the leading cat woman of post-colonial prose. In view of all the success she has had it may be surprising to find that she habitually thinks of herself as an "outsider" while hardly ever exaggerating the poverty of her family, looking instead at the world with big desiring eyes, and, despite a career of equal brilliance as a writer, wife, mother, gardener, and teacher, often a little anxious about where she stands in relation to the border line between outside/inside. The following passage encodes her experiences and does not simply repeat them. I do not believe that I know how to live in a house. I grew up outside. All my meals were cooked outside on the top of a stove-like implement made from clay called a coal pot. Then we must have grown a little more pros perous, for we acquired a kerosene stove; it had a wick that it was my duty to keep trimmed. There isn't a room in my house now that is as small as the house I grew up in. I can hardly believe that this is so, but it is really, really true. We lived outside. When we started to do things together inside our house, things other than sleeping, it was a sign of some pretension. I remember when I started to eat my meals inside with my family. I was taught to set the table. When I did anything bad, I was banished from the table and had to eat my meals outside under a soursop tree. I still do not like this fruit. Most of the things inside the house in which I grew up were thought to be very valuable. I was not allowed to touch them. Our good things were in trunks or in a mahogany cabinet that my father had made. My mother had a set of six china teacups and matching saucers commem orating the coronation of some monarch of England or another and they were locked up in that cabinet. (Kincaid 1999, 42; my emphasis) Without reading the paragraph in full, we would fail to understand the strength ofthat feeling of being rejected and the way it is activated and main</page><page sequence="19">Mustapha Marrouchi 19 tained in the narrative. Of all the benefits that come from having endured exclusion, certainly among them will be the exclusion by your own people. Within Kincaid's writing, the civic and the chthonic have always slugged it out, and the magnificent performance in The Autobiography of My Mother, to cite one example, is no exception. Scattered among the narrative's deso late moors and marshes are a few besieged centers of human cultures, cere mony, and solidarity?the dark huts of the natives which hold out against the encroaching lighted halls of the masters. Torn between light and darkness, here and there, air and earth, Kincaid, born into an Antigua whose allegiances are to some degree parochial, pre-modern, herself became an enlightened cosmopolitan liberal. Unlike most liberal writers, however, she is aware that the tug of roots and communal loyalties cannot be briskly disowned as so much surplus historical baggage. Even so, there has been a ferocious tension between the elemental and the educated in her work. If she is allured by the vastness of the mountains in Vermont, she is even more seduced by the mel low tropical warmth of the Caribbean Islands. "I was once in a garden in the mountains way above Kingston [Jamaica]," she writes,"and from a distance I saw a mass oftall stalks and red flames, something in bloom. It looked famil iar, but what it resembled, what it reminded me of, was a flower I cannot stand, and these flowers I saw before me I immediately loved, and they made me feel glad for the millionth time that I am from the West Indies" (1999, 119).There is a similar tension between the post-colonial Kincaid culturally alien to literary America, and the Kincaid who can sometimes sound, polit ically speaking, like she might have been raised in Piedmont, West Virginia. To the question "The declaration of Independence . . . talks about freedom, a concept that has been important to you creatively. What does freedom mean to you?" put to her, she answers, "Of course you only are familiar with freedom if you have its opposite. The thing to remember about the Declaration of Independence ... is that it was written by people who were quite free_The obsession with freedom makes no sense when it applies to them" (1997, 30). For Kincaid, what reconciles freedom and its opposite, oppression, is the redressing activity of writing itself, an occupation as seri ous in form as it is demystified in content. But the novel allows Kincaid to relish a more precise kind of resolution, since it accommodates conflicting realities, slavery, and freedom, within a single order. It is written by a post colonial woman-writer about the pre-independence past of her people, and thus combines historical detachment and imaginative inwardness. Kincaid vowed never to forget how her ancestors came from Africa to the West Indies as slaves. "As I sit here enjoying myself to a degree, I never give up thinking about the way I came into the world, how my ancestors came from Africa to the West Indies as slaves. I just could never forget it. Or forgive it. It's like a</page><page sequence="20">20 College Literature 34.3 [Summer 2007] big wave that's still pulsing" (Garis 1990, 42). Which brings us back, perhaps not so circuitously to Lucy, a novel both subtle and savage. It is an obvious target for Kincaid's talents, which are in any case so formidable that she needs a big-time novel that will give her a good run for her money. In Lucy, her heroine is a teenage girl who arrives from the Caribbean in the 1960s to work as an au pair for Lewis and Mariah, an affluent, earth-loving couple who live with their young children in Manhattan. Like Caryl Phillips's Cambridge in Cambridge, Lucy reverses the order of authority in the bond between master (mistress, actually) and servant, and like him she finds herself in the role of provider of love. Paradoxically, that is just what she cannot receive herself The form of her protest against patronizing assumptions about herself is taken from the feminine arsenal: obstruction. She is uncooperative when others want her to fit in or to feel as they planned. Lucy has an exper imental indifference, a sane ingratitude, toward the people who offer her friendship, sex, or opportunities, as she drops nursing, then the nanny job. The bohemian arrangements she makes for herself as a protection, as if her sur vival were based on not letting anyone get close to her. She wins, because new people are merely specimens to her, as is the messenger from her island who reports the contents of the letters she has avoided reading: the illness and death of her father. At the climax of the novel are the tears of loss she has been putting off throughout. Kincaid makes the effort to tap the power of the "barbaric, broken utter ance" and turns it to harmonious effect.The attempt to paint Lucy as a "small drowning soul" is audacious, to say the least. She also shows how singularity is an ambiguous condition. The world being jettisoned is that of Lucy, with its interest in prose and domination?a world whose values have failed to resolve the conflict between oppressor and oppressed. And yet these very val ues?respect for the individual, decency, restraint-become the measure of what is missing, in human terms, in the plight of breaking free. This is the personal life killed by history and revived by Kincaid. It is from this per spective?the recognition that our moral health depends on our ability to acknowledge some kind of selfhood in others?that Lucy and Kincaid can be best approached. In the meantime, the narrative voice in the novel is self consciously naive, and at times arch: "Mariah wanted me to see some paint ings by a man, a French man, who had gone half-way across the world to live and had painted pictures of the people he found living there" (1991, 23). In many other places, however, the satire is crisp. Mariah "had too much of everything, and so she longed to have less; less, she was sure, would bring her happiness. To me it was a laugh and a relief to observe the unhappiness that too much can bring" (57).This is the kind of domestic irony we expect from a writer like Kincaid whose talent is strongly drawn to narrative, but she also</page><page sequence="21">Mustapha Marrouchi 21 feels herself "peculiar," and her novels conjure up a spirit armed with the ele ments of language, battling to regain entry to the source from which it emerged: in her case, this entails a journey from the Caribbean, the place she is from, back to her home in Vermont?or "homeland, the text,"?to bor row a phrase from Adorno. Kincaid manages Lucy's first-person voice with delicacy and skill; it is a tricky feat to perform, making her a mouthpiece for the less fortunate with out setting her up as the crudest sort of renegade, which would have ban ished all moral tension from the story. The writer's grip on her persona rarely slackens, though some usages seem anachronistic: for example, repeated men tion of the word "servant" is presumed in the novel to offend both black and liberal white alike, whereas it is surely the case that the contemptuous over tones, not to say unspeakability, became emphatic only recently. Throughout the greater part of the novel, Lucy seems to be little more than a mote in her master's eye, and had we to rely on "white talk" alone, that is all she would remain. This is what James Baldwin was referring to when he spoke of the "nightmare called history"?the tale told from one side only (1955, 81). In order to come close to the reality it attempts to depict, the story needs answering back?which is what happens in the novel. In her brief account, Lucy tells of her alienation from her mother, her later freedom in New York, where she, who has never been in an elevator or an apartment, or eaten food from a refrigerator, sleeps soundly her first night in this new place, though she is surprised by her homesickness for the very people back home whose every gesture used to send her to rage. But almost immediately a cold eye settles over the narrative that charts her acute awareness of, if not her wish to reconcile, what she calls her outside and inside selves. The former is, of course, well behaved, obedient, passive; the latter skeptical, astute, proudly intelligent. Lucy's self-assertion is reckless, regretful, but irresistible, and it is Kincaid's representation of it as inevitable that accounts for the psycholog ical richness of the text. Taken together, Lucy reads like a tone poem or symbolist exercise. What draws a line under it as apprentice work is the writer's crowded, poetic lan guage, the one thing one cannot find in My Garden (Book), made of few big words like "The world as we know it, after all, began in a very good garden, a completely satisfying garden?Paradise?but after a while the owner and its occupants wanted more" (Kincaid 1999,67). In this case, happily, the yield is no less luscious. What Kincaid regards as valuable about the Empire, to judge from her fiction, is that it is, first and foremost, a form of rhetoric. In the early pages of Lucy, she writes of Lucy's plan to leave her home in Antigua: "It all came off very efficiently, in a way that very few things in that state ever did" (24). There is a kind of pride in this habitual inefficiency, as if</page><page sequence="22">22 College Literature 34.3 [Summer 2007] such a fantastic assemblage of different peoples could only be fictional, mag ical-as if it could only really exist for the novel. Kincaid loves the Empire as a fictional form, as something analogous to the novel itself. Thus, apparently paradoxically, she cherishes the unwieldy diversity of its people and plants while praising again and again the way in which the furniture of Empire is exactly the same wherever you go: the same local railway station, lying like a cat in the snow or the sun, the pub with its portrait of Queen Victoria, and its buxom, blonde barmaid; the same English garden with its calm and beau ty designed to reproduce someone's idea of a vast and noble meadow baking in the sun of an English summer day insulated from the outside world of the natives, all of these based on the great imperial model of London. Kincaid, in her fiction, delights in the Empire as a kind of uniform. If this Empire is almost too magical to exist in reality, it is too magical for the novel. (And, of course, she wrote all her novels after the Empire had ceased to exist). Approaching Kincaid as we would any other novelist, by locating her ideas in context, does not mean that we should easily dismiss them. For who is more omnivorous?not to mention lewd?than Kincaid, the frizzle-head ed cat woman of twenty first-century post-colonial writing? Shocking still the sheer salaciousness of the prose, even in the works of her apprenticeship, written at a time when she was on the road, in search of a home. Like the following scene, in which the precocious yet virginal young heroine, recent ly arrived in Roseau with her dreamy widower father, is flirting with Jack LaBatte, an "unbeautiful" middle-aged man by whom (though she has not realized it yet) she desperately wants to be fucked. She describes feverishly, fluently, and brilliantly the encounter, which I will give in full. I was running the fingers of my left hand through the small thick patch of hair between my legs and thinking of my life as I had lived it so far, fifteen years of it now, and I saw that Monsieur LaBatte was standing not far off from me, looking at me. He did not run away in embarrassment and I, too, did not run away in embarrassment.We held each others gaze. I removed my fingers from between my legs and brought them up to my face, I want ed to smell myself. It was the end of the day, my odor was quite powerful. This scene of me placing my hand between my legs and then enjoying the smell of myself and Monsieur LaBatte watching me lasted until the usual sudden falling of the dark, and so when he came closer to me and asked me to remove my clothes, I said, quite sure of myself, knowing what it was I wanted, that it was too dark, I could not see. She continues: He took me to the room in which he counted his money, the money that was only some of the money he had. It was a dark room and so he kept a small lamp always lighted in it. I took off my clothes and he took off his clothes. . . . [I]t was anticipation that kept me enthralled. And the force of</page><page sequence="23">Mustapha Marrouchi 23 him inside me, inevitable as it was, again came as a shock, a long sharp line of pain that then washed over me with the broadness of a wave, a long sharp line of pleasure: and to each piercing that he made inside me, I made a cry that was the same cry, a cry of sadness, for without making of it something it really was not I was not the same person I had been before. (Kincaid 1997, 70-71) One can see why the teenage narrator ("mean and avid for emotions") fell for Monsieur LaBatte. Not only does Kincaid, in such malign passages, suc cessfully defend against the coiling, morally ambiguous narrator persona, she also manages throughout the narrative to maintain her own elegant count er?offensive?through a sensuous sometimes comic mobilization of style. What she says of her subject might once again apply to herself. Her ability to compose exquisite prose never falters. One reads her novels, above all, as a ravishing exercise de style?an experiment, at points rivaling any great writer, in the fruitful, titillating, and ultimately profound arrangement of words. The following excerpt is a Kincaid specialty: "No one observed and beheld me, I observed and beheld myself; the invisible current went out and it came back to me. I came to love myself in defiance, out of despair, because there was nothing else" (1997, 36). Xuela already knows how to live without being loved. What she says about herself is so heightened and grand in feeling that you never think of her remarks as self-pitying. This is another trick of the Kincaidian narrative voice. And by the end, Xuela achieves something quite special?a transformation of the wrestling match, that all-girl fight to the death, into a kind of witty erotic dance. For despite its rivalrous energy, this is a deeply engaged portrait of its subject. Kincaid does not escape Cocteau 's observation that "everything in art is monstrous" (1995, 36). It is clear how much the reader relishes the emotional intelligence born out of honesty and vulnerability, and Kincaid is appreciative of those who bravely espouse it. The prurience here, as elsewhere in Kincaid, is breathtaking: a lascivi ousness so direct, rosy, and dizzying that even the bantering, ultra-humble LaBatte dissolves into hard, quiet jerks of voyeuristic delight. Yet there is also something upsetting about Kincaid's rude daring: something in the very unflinchingness of the primitive association of sexual pleasure with feeding at the breast which disturbs as much as it arouses. We know?but also do not want to know-how good it feels to suck. Kincaid invariably connects human happiness with a voluptuous, feminine pliancy, and with the power of dom ination?a pleasure that becomes purer for her with age, and toward which she expresses an infant's sense of entitlement. She revels, in other words, in the frank regressive seizure of the breast and/or female sexual organ?in going after what she wants without shame or pudeur. The following passage proceeds to let rip.</page><page sequence="24">24 College Literature 34.3 [Summer 2007] And sometimes when the night was completely still and completely black, I could hear, outside, the long sigh of someone on the way to eternity; and this, of all things, would disturb the troubled peace of all that was real: the dogs asleep under houses, the chickens in the trees, the trees themselves moving about, not in a way that suggested an uprooting, just a moving about, as if they wished they could hear the sound of those who crawled on their bellies, the ones who carried poisonous lances, and those who car ried a deadly poison in their saliva; I could hear the ones who were hunt ing, the ones who were hunted, the pitiful cry of the small ones who were about to be devoured, followed by the temporary satisfaction of the ones doing the devouring: all this I heard night after night, again and again. And it ended only after my hands had traveled up and down all over my own body in a loving caress, finally coming to the soft, moist spot between my legs, and a gasp of pleasure had escaped my lips which I would allow no one to hear. (Kincaid 1997, 42; my emphasis) To put it more bluntly: let Xuela be Xuela?in all her sobriety, reticence, and artistic self-possession. To read her?the prodigal literary gifts, the fearsome productivity, the emotional gormandizing, the sheer untrammeled aggres siveness of her search for sensual and imaginative fulfilment?can be at once exhausting and unsettling. She is scary because she challenges us to a kind of psychosexual wrestling match: who will be the one who gets to suck? If it feels good to suck, it also feels good to be sucked, and like a moth er cat voluptuously yielding to her kittens, Kincaid surrenders everything to us in the work. Sex?that "mysterious despair that I seek and fear" (qtd. Thurman 1999, 89), as Colette once put it?may have driven her toward perversity in writing, but it has also provided her with an imagery for that miraculous conjunction of body and soul, heart and mind, Self and Other, which is the core vision of her art. Such clarifying hedonism may be in the end equivalent to an ethic: a credo without a god, or an afterlife, but with the power of all true faith to inspire ecstasy, and reverence for artistic creation and daring, and to console. For Kincaid is the sort of writer it is easy to feel we have grown out of-that we already know her too well, that we long ago took from her all that we could. Perhaps because something about her inevitably conjures up the embarrassing daydreams of youth?all those thoughts of love, food, gardening, being shocking and not oneself. All those books! Those plants! Those senses! That body! That taste! That touch! That aroma! That smell!?it is easy to assume she has no new news to impart. In the meantime, the familiar, knowing tone of postmodern confusion of styles soon loses its appeal; the narrative skips over details and expects its readers to work out for themselves what is going on. The pattern is shown in The Autobiography of My Mother where Kincaid uses the concept of "Mother" as a metaphor for history, tradition, culture, identity, nurturance,</page><page sequence="25">Mustapha Marrouchi 25 and love. A richly layered, multivalent narrative, it is also the story of the Carib and African people of Dominica and the Europeans who, in inaugu rating and forcing their disconnection and displacement, ensured their own. The novel presents Kincaid's most complex character yet. It is the story of a woman whose brief life echoes with rejection but who nonetheless refuses to surrender the idea that she matters regardless of cost, even if that comes at the expanse of forgiveness, compassion, maternity, and love. Ironically, the novel is in some way about a mother of her mother's generation. But as the reader waits for the narrator, Xuela, to introduce the birth of Kincaid's sur rogate she continues to terminate unwanted pregnancies in the dark. At the end of the novel, Xuela remarks that she is seventy years old and childless. Perhaps Kincaid set out to frustrate the easy interpretation of her work as an autobiographical chain. Certainly she means to ring another change on her theme of motherhood and the withdrawal of this primary relationship. In her earlier fiction, one narrator is an only child, another had her mother to herself until the birth of brothers, or a narrator talks back to her mother and is told that until that moment she had been her favorite. Having to share a mother seems a problem, as if parental care in a backwater were a limited resource. Fathers in Kincaid's narrative are likely to have many children by sever al women. Lucy's father has perhaps thirty offspring, and her mother consults an obeah woman when she suspects that one of the women is trying to harm her, the woman her father finally marries, and her child. The women who plot against her do not scheme against her husband, and Lucy understands what her mother means when she tells her never to take a man's side against a woman. So much for the men. The women, on the other hand, never tell the reader where they are speaking from. They are not sitting at a desk and looking back; they give no indication of the life they go on to make. They just present their point of view about personal events in the past and/or pres ent. Like their creator, they explicate rather than illuminate. In the meantime, the most perfectionist aestheticism can, of course, throw off this special con tempt for the "perfect." It is hardly a post-colonial writer who yawns that "all the rest is literature." But I want to go rather further and try to show that in Kincaid's work this feeling for the "reprehensible" goes deeper, shaping and affecting it at that inexplicit level from which her narrative takes so much of its real power. Indeed, a pursuit of truth which is also a flight from "Art" seems to me to condition the whole development of her narrative. It is rel evant here that Kincaid said her ambition was to write novels, works closer to life than poems; indeed her testimony is a superb defense of the novel pre cisely for this truth-to-life. The note is perfectly struck in Mr. Potter, a narra tive that develops according to the struggle, perhaps the effort of all true makers, to escape soft personal predilection and allow the telling to commit</page><page sequence="26">26 College Literature 34.3 [Summer 2007] itself to lucid strength, to the nature of things as they are beyond the fantasies of the ego. The essential virtue of the novel is the concentration of personal feeling in each sentence accompanied by an extreme circumscription of any merely personal expression of the self. Kincaid is often described as a post colonial writer, as she probably is in some sense: but the term explains too litde without qualifying questions and explanations. The presence of feeling, and the attribution of feeling to familiar objects does not itself constitute post-coloniality, unless we are post-colonial every time we stroke that cat. What is striking in Kincaid's narrative is the way in which the simple cere monies and occasions of feeling (the multiple liaisons dangereuses of Mr. Potter come to mind) are set forward, in the intensely crafted narrative, to fill the void of the abnegation of poetic authority. And although the writer is on the side of the anxious, ofthat underclass of persons singled out in Mr. Potter, the hyper-sensitive, she still leaves some room for hope. Where Proust, for exam ple, stands back and reveals in the lucidity with which he can account for the conduct and indeed behavior of his (named) characters, Kincaid allows no such cordon sanitaire between ourselves and the nameless individuals over heard negotiating a way of life with one another. Describing an encounter between Mr. Shoul and his entourage, she writes: He found Mr. Potter and all who looked like Mr. Potter and they were so sat isfying, these people who were Mr. Potter and look like Mr. Potter, that they erased for him the longing for large bolts of silk that could only be compared to petals of roses and the longing to mingle with bangles and bracelets and earrings made of gold or silver and bands of anything studded with precious stones. (Kincaid 2002,111; my emphais) Having long made her escape from school, Kincaid is not now going to play teacher, and foreclose on the sensations she puts on display by declaring what their significance is. We are only too likely to do that for ourselves, and rather spoil things by "fixing" the sensations so artfully presented to us in their true, labile state. In Mr. Potter, as we know, people act in the strangest, contradictory ways and we do not expect to be told what has led them to do so. As characters they remain in one piece only because they have names; they can hardly be thought of as psychological entities, as they give way to what Kincaid calls their "bizarre contortions" (Cudjoe 1990,45). Bizarre of course only because opaque: could we look inside them we would learn about their plight. And look inside them, we must. Take, for example, Mr. Potter, who is "born with a line drawn through him" on the birth certificate (father unknown), him self father of many children, indifferent to them all" (2002, 34). Unlike Mr. Shoul and Dr. Weizenger, who, in spite of their status as migrants from the old world, do each have an identity card, Mr. Potter is without an ?tat civil or</page><page sequence="27">Mustapha Marrouchi 27 lineage. This is an important detail for it implies that no ?tat civil means no character as such, except for the purpose of parody. He is a characterless char acter allotted a function in the plot that oddly contradicts his good solid name; for Mr. Potter is un homme de paille, or strawman, who has no address or home to go to. He is merely a source of ingenious speculation on the part of others whose status quo "character" has no ultimate foundation. Kincaid's point is that to affix an ?tat civil to a living and therefore indeterminate human being like Mr. Potter is to freeze them into a premature essence. ("Call no man happy till he is dead," said the Greeks. "Call no man anything till he is dead," is Kincaid's more comprehensive, post-Existentialist version). This is not just a matter of the novelist making an amusing case against superannuated notions of "character" in fiction. Kincaid is advising us how we might best react to real life and real living people. Fictional characters do not remain safely trapped within fiction; they are the models we like to resort to when pleasurably bent on our amateur readings of the contortionists around us-which, by worrying reversal, may seem disappointingly pallid or unreal by comparison with their fictional originals. This on the face of it is outrageous, but one more Kincaidian proof needless to say of our longing for an intelligible solidity. She will have none of it; she would rather we went with the flow, instead of feebly abdicating from it under the illusion that we have now made safe sense of the people we know. The post-Mr. Potter Kincaid became more inward, the settings for her narrative more tenuous, their prose more measured. This is how she describes parting with her son, who had not wanted to part with her: "All the time my state of mind was influenced by the hard fact that my thirteen-year-old son had not wanted me to go away. That he had said good-bye to me with tears rolling down his cheeks; that he had, days before, asked people he thought could influence me, to tell me outright, my going away to this place, for such a long time, would cause him to suffer. I love my children, more than I love myself" (2005, 9). As the prose shows in Among Flowers, she has become the supreme contriv er of a new antiphony, by playing an overt, actually spoken, suspiciously trite dialogue, which is the reverse of trite and seldom benign. This is her sup porting an undercurrent which is oral in its form but made unspeakable by its content, both wildly indecorous as it may turn out and inaccessible even to those imagined as engaged in it. Almost nothing now needed to be hap pening in the narrative to set this seditious music playing. With down-to earth elegance she summons up a realm where one can feel a rich life and a colorful love pulsating like never before. Youthfulness, and the harm that is done with and to it in a colonial soci ety, is a theme all but pervasive in Kincaid. She is no Freudian but is more than willing to take the experience of childhood as a template for the future.</page><page sequence="28">28 College Literature 34.3 [Summer 2007] Her grown-ups suspect, even if they never quite recognize, that in their most agitated moments they are responding in childlike ways, that they are still children while everyone else has apparently gained the security that comes with being adult.Yet by their regressions, and by kicking against the tempta tions of a dim dependency, the insecure ones are becoming painfully alive again as witness Mr. Potter where the narrative is not only discontinuous but also repetitious. In the process, Kincaid crosses and re-crosses the line between meaning and its converse the same way Gertrude Stein did before her. Though no less wayward, her conjurations have a narrower purpose: There is a wide, undulating plateau filled with yellow grass growing thick ly and straight up from the moist, dark earth, and the yellow grass grows determinedly beneath a clear blue sky and birds are flying in the morning right after they fall out of sleep and then flying and singing in the evening just before they fall into sleep and their sleep is without grass and moist earth and blue, blue sky and existence without threat is not the world into which I was born. (Kincaid 2002, 55; my emphasis) Such an exploration is narrated with the real deliberateness with which you do a difficult, small bare thing that really matters to you. The original inno vation of this way of telling lies in the presentation of domestic time: now Kincaid is simply giving us un- or disregarded time-personal, tawdry, and momentary?seen so closely and unremittingly that the attention itself almost begins to work as a distorting mirror. After all, one of the hallmarks of obsession is attention to a paucity of things, and to make use of obsession is a naturalistic procedure when describing the "natural" world Kincaid was born into. To put the matter differently, for every reader hypnotized by the rhythm and texture, there are likely to be ten who mentally snap at the author: "Why not say so in the first place? Before I put my shoulder to a sen tence you made disappear at the last minute." The exploration of the condi tions under which a word-obsessed child might be seen as predestined to write. Mr. Potter is far more direct than that, and Kincaid does not give in: her memories are kept independent of each other as she recovers them, not smoothed over into a single narrative; and when she senses a need, she paus es from remembering and enters, by way of a sous-conversation, into a dialogue with herself, in which she wonders how truthful she is being in appearing to recall these particular moments of her past. There could be no cleverer or more elegant compromise between the formal and the confessional than that found by Kincaid in Mr. Potter, and no more intense entr?e to her oeuvre. Her childhood was not a good one. A desolate start to her life, and one retraced with a stylish composure by the writer, who is willing to guess how things actually stood between the people in the story, but unwilling to impose her guesswork on us as the final truth.</page><page sequence="29">Mustapha Marrouchi 29 The method she employs is not unfamiliar, but it is not so new as to defy comprehension; her novels can be called "realistic" only if your measure of "reality" is one that has stood unchanged since Balzac was writing. Kincaid is not a historicist. She has read widely; and when she started to write for herself she saw no point in attempting to do the same things by the same means as had been used by other novelists in the past. Henry Louis Gates explains: "There is a self-contained world which [she] ... explores with great detail. Not to chart the existence of that world, but to show that human emotions manifest themselves everywhere." One of Kincaid's most important contributions, he thinks, is her tacit acceptance of a world that many writers would find necessary to delineate sociologically. She never feels the necessity of claiming the existence of a black world or a female sensibility. She assumes them both. I think it's a distinct departure that she's making, and I think that more and more black American writers will assume their world the way she does. So that we can get beyond the large theme of racism and get to the deeper themes of how black people love and cry and live and die. Which, after all, is what art is all about, (qtd. Garisl990, 43) Derek Walcott goes further than Gates in defining her unusual blending of theme and technique: The simplicity of her sentences is astounding. As she writes a sentence, the temperature of it psychologically is that it heads toward its own contradic tion. It's as if the sentence is discovering itself, discovering how it feels. And that's astounding, because it's one thing to be able to write a good declar ative sentence; it's another thing to catch the temperature of the narrator, the narrator's feeling. And that's universal, and not provincial in any way. (qtd. Garis 1990, 45) Or, to put it differently, the thing is to keep the art of fiction moving on, in the direc tion laid down for it by the great names of the generation preceding her own?Proust, Joyce,Woolf, Stein.They had turned the novel definitively inward and taken possession of areas of consciousness that might seem near to the limits of the sayable. Kincaid's ways of telling are not to be a way, not of penetrating further even than Proust or Joyce had been able to into the obscurities of the subconscious, or in her case, better to say the preconscious, but of representing what is lurking there by other means. Her way is to display, never in so many words to analyze, our most fugitive sensations as and when they arise, not in the real time of the mind but in a fictive slow motion. Kincaid differs from chosen predecessors by daring to be less explicit than they were. There are no explanatory captions as it were underneath her tiny scenes of intimate triumph or dis tress as witness the narrator in Mr. Potter,who never had a conversation with her father, but once stood near him and,</page><page sequence="30">30 College Literature 34.3 [Summer 2007] said, through gestures only, that he was mine and I was his, that the world, in all its parts, was complicated, with plates beneath its surface shifting and colliding, with vast subterranean cauldrons of steam and gases mixing and exploding violently through the earth's crust, that the seemingly invisible spaces between two people who shared a common intimate history were impossible to destroy. (Kincaid 2002, 67) She was four at the time, but her mimic skills were highly developed. The means are incantation and repetition, endless variations on "Mr. Potter was my father." This is prose that stakes everything on bewitching, uninterested in informing, entertaining or even seducing. The method actually works bet ter with minor figures, like the remembered mother of Mr. Potter's employer: Her arms were plump and dimpled near the elbows and her legs were plump and dimpled near the back of the knees and her cheeks were plump and short hairs grew thickly and formed half a circle just above her eyes and she ate dates and figs which were often piled up in a glass bowl made of pure crystal and placed right in front of her and she looked out of the win dows and laughed at nothing. (Kincaid 2002, 71) Even the narrator's mother occasionally flickers into life: "She then was flames in her own fire, not waves in her own sea, she would be that later, after I was born and had become a grown woman, she would become that to me, an ocean with its unpredictable waves and undertow; she was then flames in her own fire and was very beautiful" (2002, 89). But Mr. Potter remains absolutely inert. Perhaps it is enough for the narrator, under cover of piety ("because I learned how to read and how to write, only so is Mr. Potter's life known, his smallness becomes large, his anonymity is stripped away, his silence broken"), to be able to write: "I am now the central figure in Mr. Potter's life" (111). A proposition true only on paper. It is difficult to go on without sounding completely mad. Let me just say that reading Kincaid, one finds himself trapped between pain and striving, on the one hand, and boredom and emptiness, on the other. By and large, Kincaid pays lip service to historical and religious perspectives, without seeming to see their contradictions. Sometimes the "year 1492" is invoked as the explanation of all Caribbean misery; at other times, she refers to the "cauldron of misery and small cup of joy that is all of life."The ultimate effect is of a cancelling out: "I believe now that all aspiration is futile and I knew then that to violently demand and make a change was essential and I see now that all change is its same self and all different selves are the same" (2002, 147). For Kincaid, change resembles tropism, which in biology, is the instinc tive movement that occurs when an organism responds to an outside stimu lus: the often microscopic reorientation by which a plant or an animal react, and thus a dramatic encounter of sorts, enacted without benefit of con</page><page sequence="31">Mustapha Marrouchi 31 sciousness among the vegetable and animal orders. With her they become the metaphor that gives her access to what she regards as the rightful subject matter for a modern novelist. Transferred to the human order, these proto zoan manoeuvrings can serve as a model for the secret fencing matches fought out between any two people coming psyche to psyche, when one psyche will be out to take advantage of the other. Think of the double curse of low expectations from both the colonial ruler and her own mother and the case will be clear enough. "I'm someone who writes to save her life," she says. "I mean, I can't imagine what I would do if I didn't write. I would be dead or I would be in jail because?what else could I do? I can't really do anything but write. All the things that were available to someone in my posi tion involved being a subject person. And I'm very bad at being a subject person." True, inasmuch as her career in fiction is to be a search for new, ever more pared-down forms in which to turn these barely detectable fluctua tions into words, so as to make them apparent for once in all their comic, damaging, or simply lamentable ephemerality. When this works, as it does most of the time, the narrative showcases a sharp sense of humor, an apho ristic way with ideas, and an ability to write perceptive accounts of life in its multiple dimensions. In reading such a narrative, one gets the impression that Kincaid sees herself as a redresser of the wrongs done to her people. This role she assumes with dignity and flair. In doing so, she continues that search on with rare single-mindedness and to wonderfully entertaining effect. Ill In the upshot, what is striking about Kincaid is that she is a gifted real ist, and her powers come from her sense of the way in which individuals as well as communities?especially poor, small, socially anxious, limited ones?construct and guard their reality. As a writer, she knows what it is to escape a shared harsh reality, yet she writes well about those who can only enforce this reality. Often?and often in this representative narrative of her work?she begins a story in the present and then moves back several years, and even decades. The community sense of itself is tightened by this back ward placement and displacement, while the pool of shared values enlarges her freedom. Occasionally, one feels that she makes things easier for herself by limiting her canvas to small societies in smaller times. Often, her stories move around the disruption brought to a community by a displaced indi vidual. She is generally vigilant, however. And this is in spite of her narrative which deploys the self-calibration and self-protectiveness of small places against themselves. The prose of this narrative is not lavish: it is intelligently starved; not sticky with metaphor, or crowded with detail. There are times when this technique disappoints. But neither is her prose deprived. Many</page><page sequence="32">32 College Literature 34.3 [Summer 2007] times, she finds exactly what she needs, as in this following description of a storm. The passage is ingratiating enough to bear quoting: I could hear the clap of thunder, the roar of water falling from great heights into great pools and the great pool wending its way slowly toward the sea; I could hear clouds emptying themselves of their moisture as if by accident, as if someone had kicked over a goblet in the dark, and their contents land ing on an indifferent earth; and I could hear the silence and I could hear the dark night gobbling it up, and it in turn being gobbled up by the light of yet another day. (Kincaid 1997, 95) As such, the Caribbean is not evoked so much as it exists entirely in the sen sory alertness of Kincaid's language to weather, mood, vegetation, hearing, scent, taste, and color. The lyricism is deft and controlled. The description also flows out of its high familiarity and her open appeal to the known: somehow turreted in effect but lacking any towers, yes?the "family home." Kincaid has an acute eye for comic detail, in particular the comedy of fastidiousness. It is difficult to trace an autobiographical watermark in any of her novels insofar as the writing is too thickly other, properly turned out ward, away from the author. It is what Barthes would have called the "econ omy of language." Over the course of Among Flowers, however, a kind of Jamaica is faintly visible: she is a mother in middle age. She is conspiratorial with other women. This mother, who recurs throughout the narrative, may not be an autobiographical ghost. Seen so tenderly yet so majestically, betray ing herself in the act of protecting herself, she can also be seen as the spirit of her writing. As a post-colonial writer to whom English means not so much as what it means in the place she is:?"English, and proper English, is the language of legitimacy and the language of reality?all the things that are not described in the proper European language are not considered real; they are unreal and not to be taken seriously" (1997, 337)?Kincaid felt dispos sessed of her own language, until the tentacular roots of certain words, the complex crossings between the rim of the world and the rock of the dome, forced their way into her narrative. It is a typically brash, subtle Kincaid trope, but one rather more slippery than she suspects. The epiphanic moment hoists her out of earth into air, out of her sullen politico-linguistic resent ment into a "sweetening awareness" of verbal hybridity. The polarities of colonial and post-colonial, modern and postmodern, are momentarily col lapsed, in what Kincaid, borrowing a phrase from the Irish poet John Montague, describes as an escape from the "partitioned intellect" into some larger-spirited, unsectarian country of the mind. West Indian writers have always had to break the mold in order to be free. George Lamming articulates the importance of the idea best: "Free is how you is from the start, an' when it look different you got to move, just</page><page sequence="33">Mustapha Marrouchi 33 move, an' when you movin' say that is a natural freedom make you move" (qtd. James 1992,311). Today, however, moving around in search for freedom does not necessarily mean that you have to sail for England as Samuel Selvon, George Lamming, andV.S. Naipaul, to name but a few, did.13 One has the feeling too that the most liberating thing for Kincaid is that she herself ended up not in London as her fellow countrymen and women did but in America, a place where she moves around in relative safety, and, perhaps more impor tantly, where she is free of the English historical point of view and the oppressive suspicion that white Britons think that what every black Briton wants is to be accepted as English. New York first and now Vermont where Kincaid lives are also important because her writing is part of something larger: it includes Francophone, Indian, African, Hispanic as well as native Indian models. One reason as to why it is difficult not to be moved by the sheer commitment of her high-minded narrative. Perhaps it is too well intentioned for its own good insofar as it is full of statements about freedom, rootlessness, and emancipation which are perceptive, subtle, forceful, reason able, and convincing. Reading Kincaid this way is both pleasurable and dis turbing?and it is also about that ambivalent duo, pleasure and disturbance. Kincaid, who studied the hidden mission of style, also has style in abun dance?a definite way with words?and her tongue is often in her cheek. My recourse to that flaccid metaphor drolly underscores her idea that lan guage and the body are bound together?often gagged?in secret, inviolable secretions or nuggets. To this end, when you read a writer like Kincaid, you begin?and end?with the prose because the great delight of this Caribbean novelist lies in her strange, nimble, curling sentences, which are always skew ing into the most unexpected metaphors. It is rare to find luminous powers of realism and narrative clarity so finely combined (and/or tempered) with a high poetic feminine heat. There is a poem on every page of Kincaid, and certainly, her almost nervous fondness for metaphor recalls the image blessed, image-sick prose of another, Caryl Phillips, more so than any novel ist. Perceptual confusion is integral to her work. Perception, expectation, and artifice thwart one another, nothing is as it appears, and everyone seems receptive to the imposition of alternate existence. All her novels sustain this deeply ambiguous attitude toward reality, positing it less as a fixed ontologi cal entity than as a matter of circumstance. Jamaica Kincaid is at her most intriguing when she is exploring the intersection of representation (includ ing everything from nature to life to death to art) and reality.</page><page sequence="34">34 College Literature 34.3 [Summer 2007] Notes 1 Edward Said makes a good case for the idea of the writer as displaced intel ligence. 2 Pascale Casanova makes a case for VS.
