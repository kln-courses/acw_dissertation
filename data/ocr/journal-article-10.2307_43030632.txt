<plain_text><page sequence="1">After the City , by Lars Lerup, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2000. 200 pp., $24.95 cloth. After the City is a demanding, inscrutable, im- aginative, insightful work that, dazzling as it is in parts, ultimately fails to convincingly achieve its objectives. The frame of reference is the sub- urban metropolis, Houston for the most part: formless, fluid, market-driven, anti-architectural. Rather than reject this "holey plane," the author seeks to engage and define a new ameliorating urbanism through a "distributed" architectural praxis that adds real social and cultural value to the built forms of (sub)urban life. The argument is explored rather obliquely through allusions, metaphor, synecdoche, simulacra, symbolism, and stories. There are implications for profes- sional education, for long term shifts in societal values, and re-reading architectural history. Meta-salvation lies in redesigning single family housing, the basic building block of metropolitan form. Ultimate reconciliation lies in rethinking the metropolis "toward nature, or should we say the preternatural alloy of nature and artifice." Expanding ideas in an essay, "Stim and Dross: Rethinking the Metropolis" first published in 1994, the book is also about making sense of the author's own work and artistic awakenings back to the 1960s. Lerup is a self-confessed suburban obsessive committed to "Planned assaults on domestic arrangement." He is presently Smith Professor in Architecture and Dean at Rice University in Houston, and After the City also reads as manifesto for that school, a philosophi- cal stance that develops architecture as built thought through the lens of urbanism. Spawned by an inner need to transcend the nihilism of Manfredo Tafuri in Architecture and Utopia : Design and Capitalist Development (1976) and driven by the utopianism of Le Corbusier's "new man," this is a dense, her- meneutical reading of the city. Full of learned references (Bataille, Borges, Eco) the intellec- tual superstructure comes from key theorists: Walter Benjamin, the Michels Foucault and Ser- res, and fellow "artist-thinkers" like Marcel Duchamp. The text is saturated with dialectical explorations of bifurcated constructs: nature and technology, contemplation and action, certitude and possibility, push and pull, Jeffersonian agrarianism and Hamiltonian mercantilism, Benjamin's "distraction and concentration," and the author's own fixation on flickering "stims" (nodes of stimulation/frantic activity) amid a sea of "dross" (leftover lacuna of the "metropolitan machine.") His trajectory is not some limp mid- dle way but a transcendent harnessing of the power of paradox and ambiguity into the "doublespace" linking inner and outer. The terrain covered in this somewhat obscure journey is nonetheless exhilarating. With showy intellectual dexterity, it encompasses readings of the Pantheon in Rome, the University of Vir- ginia at Charlottesville, Larry McMurtry's Ar- cher City, Donald Judd's Marfa, the running of the bulls, a summer vacation on an island off Stockholm, Renzo Piano's Menil Collection (1987) in Houston, and the unavoidable Panop- ticon. (Strangely absent is the discussion of how Levittown residents seek and create community promised by the cover blurb.) The assembly of the book is complex, but as- sumes four main parts. Excavating through a shifting, layered, artfully constructed and as- sembled text, the central rationale of each is hard-won. The first section, taking us far from Houston, ultimately establishes the writer's methodology. We are introduced to an anthropomorphic deconstructionism which probes surface realities for deeper meanings and searches out the revelations of the spaces-in-be- tween. This is the consciousness that is to be transported and dumped "into the vast complex of the metropolis." The second section presents the Banhamian-in- spired ecologies of Houston. A description of Houston like no other - with its megashapes, ecological envelopes, zoohemic canopies, rolling streets, and canyonised freeways welcome to the paradigmatic tattered suburban anti-city - "bio- vehicular, electro-commercial, socio-electronic, and optico-ocular." Yet for all of its (post)modernity, Houston recalls ancient Sparta, a city, according to Thucydicles, of discon- tinuities and distances, devoid of both Copyright Â© 2002, Locke Science Publishing Company, Inc.

Here the problem focus sharpens: what to do with the spatial dross. The glimmer of a solution lies in a heterogeneous cultural colonization of the holey plane: a celebration of "alphabet soup." The mission of reshaping the metropolis along these intriguing if still somewhat murky lines is amplified in the third stanza, "Architecture Reconsidered." It becomes clear that the burden will lie with a new generation of creative ar- chitects (particularly Rice Graduates?) Neither heroic signature architects nor the mechanistic rank and file, they are teamplayers doing good architecture embodying "cultural and existential" values from the bottom up. The labyrinthine semantics used to construct and refract the argu- ment dissolve remarkably into lucidity at this crucial, if somewhat facile, juncture. Next, the author turns to praxis, making the single family house "the formal focus" for rescuing both the suburban metropolis and the commodified dumbing down of architecture. We get snatches of a new redemptive domestic architecture: in- cremental, juxtaposing old and new, energy-con- serving, authorless, participatory, subversive. The final "frontier" lifts the gaze to the suburban middlescape, "half city, half nature" and "wait- ing somewhere between development and squalor." A giant oak tree facing the Twombley Gallery in Houston's Museum District becomes the precarious pivot for the final revelation which places "biota as the conceptual center of a new metropolis" in which "culture and nature become coexistent multiplicities." Interspliced with the text proper are three "portfolios of images." The first, "The Metropolis" starts off the book with a set of alienating and unsettling images (and tersely opaque captions) of freeways, corporate towers, malls, cars, rear-vision mirrors. Puzzlingly, the author seems obsessed by helicopters. The more wordy and mystifying "the end of the Architec- tural Promenade" seeks to establish the single family house as fundamental to the rethinking of the metropolis. It starts as a history of (largely domestic) design ideas and navigates through some of the author's own design projects, his "inner search." "Vehicular Behavior" is a third set of photographs, taken from a physical instal- lation entitled "room," by Lerup and partner Sohela Faohki at Rice University in 1999 featur- ing multi-functional "household vehicles." In- spired by a Samuel Beckett novel and tangible embodiment of Lerup's "thought experiments," this obscure take on American mobility is, to say the least, a provocative place to kickstart the design process for home and metropolis. After the City is a brilliant, if clinical and at times obtuse, exploration of the potentialities and limitations of language. It is a creative, styl- ized work; theoretical, abstract, precisely writ- ten, but largely humorless. There are as many quotable little expressions and descriptions as there are fecund ideas and hypotheses lodged in the presentation. Some passages read like an ex- hibition catalogue; others have the high polish of a novel. But at times profundity seems to segue into triteness, and the reader's progress is stymied with eye-glazing passages of magical impenetrability. The author assumes the guise of "the wanderer": the cool, confident, urban artist- thinker confronting Texas suburbanism. The detached deconstructionist hauteur is heightened by the author "residing on the 28th floor of a high-rise building" in one of the world's lowest density cities. And much of this book seems pieced together in bytes of reverie, reflection, and inspiration gazing gulfward. Inevitably, even when he gets close to people, it's a freeway view of mysterious "overpass people" and pedestrians mutating into "variously gendered machines." The text is not so much written as commentated, which paradoxically disengages from the issues it seeks to address. At the end of the day, this book is neither as accessible nor pragmatic as the author intended, but remains hopelessly optimistic. The argument is a set of propositions assembled by literary devices rather than fully convincing explication. The jumps from dreary sub-urban metropolises through post-Corbusian building blocks to ar- chitectural salvation and the promise of the green metropolis are far too glib. The author warns us at the outset that his approach is selec- tive and the best we can hope for are some "in- cipient trajectories." But only an architect could see regional salvation in the design (let alone rhetoric) of the single family house. And the conclusion - setting the controls of the subur- ban metropolis towards the heart of nature - seems almost banal. When the author, in the final chapter, unavoidably confronts the real depths of inequality and class separation in the metropolis, he actually has little to say.

Variously reflective, unsettling, mysterious, dis- jointed, serried, After the City is the metropolis sampled. If this were a movie, it would be a col- lage of images: some static, some moving, enig- matic, beautiful, disturbing, unified by an in- flexionless, cultured Northern-European ac- cented voice-over - purposeful, resonating, earnest, challenging, detached. The ending would disappoint, but the journey there is dizzy- ing and unrelentingly creative.
