Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996. xv, 226 pp. $49.95. In this volume, sociologist Akiko Hashimoto offers us a fresh way to think about the aging of society and the questions of social support and intergenerational equity which accompany this demographic change. Rather than decrying either the burden of an aging population or the lack of welfare services, she presents a sophisticated cross-cultural account of how culture impacts a society's patterns of support for the elderly. Only a social contract can guarantee regularized giving when continued support is not in the interests of the givers. This contract, she argues, balances the inherently unequal relation between givers and receivers of help through symbolic credits and debts which define deservedness and entitlement in each society. She finds that "the difference between Japanese and American social contracts is therefore found neither in a generic tolerance for dependency nor in a critical mass of good will; it is found in the different standards of evaluation as they apply to fairness" (p. 16). The work is most impressive in its ability to navigate the spaces between power and meaning, between policy and behavior, and between theory and empirical data. The author draws on the work of social theorists such as Mauss, Giddens, Bourdieu, and Berger and Luckmann to develop the concepts of reciprocity, credit and debt, symbolic equity, and cultural assumptions. The study is also well grounded in the gerontological literature on social support and in ethnographic work on the lives of the elderly in the two societies. Hashimoto's empirical research consisted of surveys, interviews, and participant-observation over more than two years in carefully matched locations in Japan and the United States. The presentation of this material is enhanced</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS-JAPAN 1101 by the use of short case studies from Westside Odawara and West Haven elderly respondents which serve as illustrative examples throughout the book. Eight tables aid the reader in following the statistical data and comparative analysis. Hashimoto concludes that the social contract in the U.S. is based on a notion of fairness predicated on the entitlement of the receiver. The Japanese sense of fairness emphasizes the obligation, and thus the disempowerment, of the giver. Although the logic of the social contract is similar, she claims, differences in certain cultural assumptions result in quite different strategies of support. The Japanese approach assumes that (1) everyone will ultimately need care in old age; (2) security comes from structured responses which create certainty; (3) the older generation has a claim on dependence in late life; (4) the filial bond is the most significant social relationship; (5) the family is the perceived unit of self-sufficiency in society; and (6) resources are scarce and limited. Therefore the Japanese strategy of support for elderly relatives and citizens is "protective." In contrast, Americans take a "contingency" approach based on contrasting assumptions in these areas, such as that they might (rather than will) need care, that security comes through maximizing autonomy and thus diffusing assistance, and so on. Some limitations of the book are acknowledged by the author. In analyzing the contrast between Japan and the United States, she must downplay the similarities between and understate the variations within each country. The author does, however, provide rich case material as well as explicit warnings to the reader. Of greater concern is that the conclusions are based on responses of a particular historical cohort of elderly but will likely be interpreted by non-Japan specialists as ahistorically "Japanese." Hashimoto provides life history material within the case studies, but does not discuss the experiences common to this cohort in order to locate their assumptions in time, as for example Margaret Lock does in her book on middle-aged women (Encounters with Aging: Mythologies of Menopause in Japan and North America. [Berkeley: University of California Press, 19931). Hashimoto notes that modifications are occurring in the Japanese approach, such as delayed coresidence, but concludes that "the fundamental nature of the social contract in these societies is unlikely to change dramatically in the foreseeable future" (p. 192). Yet it seems to me that significant changes are taking place in Japan, as least in subsequent cohorts, in the core assumptions she so well identifies: a shift from the filial to the conjugal bond as primary; a reexamination of the assumption of family self-sufficiency in light of the increasingly common experience of caregiver burden; and a more skeptical view of their government and its priorities for its national wealth. Any research project must have its boundaries. Hashimoto has focused on support recipients, presenting the perspectives of the elderly on the social contract. She notes discrepancies in meanings attributed to deservedness and equity as the cause of conflicts between the elderly and their children or yome (daughter-in-law). Yet the latter have no direct voice in this study. Perhaps American children are not as anxious to declare independence from responsibilities for aging parents as the elderly worry, and perhaps Japanese daughters-in-law are exhausted from caring for one dependent elderly relative after another. A fuller understanding of the social contract needs to incorporate the voices of the givers as well as the receivers of support. Of course, the notion of the social contract itself is a Euroamerican construct. As Hashimoto notes, there is not even a good translation into Japanese of the important (for this study) concept of "entitlement." This intellectual tradition begs important questions related to the concept of culture. Who creates and maintains the social contract? Sentences in which "social contract" is the subject often utilize the passive</page><page sequence="3">1102 THE JOURNAL OF ASIAN STUDIES voice. The author states that the symbolic equity demanded by the social contract differs from exchange theory in that "credits and debts of symbolic value are culturally assigned to givers and receivers, rather than strictly derived from material and instrumental transactions" (p. 165). This anthropomorphic concept of culture is static, and is inconsistent with the author's own discussions of practice and habitus. Despite these reservations, I highly recommend this book for any academic reader interested in aging in the two societies, and for use in upper level undergraduate or graduate courses in gerontology and Japanese society. Ultimately, the value of such a book lies in its ability to offer new insights and predictive understandings. I found that it provided me with new ways to see support relations of the elderly in my own society and it has proven helpful in thinking about the newly conceived public long term care insurance set to begin in Japan in the year 2000. Hashimoto's analysis suggests that this new program is intended as a strategy shift away from disempowering the giver toward empowering the receiver of support. At the same time, it retains many of the cultural assumptions about the universality of need, the desire for certainty, and an intergenerational equity based on elders' claim to dependence. Other cultural assumptions have changed however, or must change, to be consistent with this plan, for example, a deemphasis on filiality as the primary social bond and the notion that families represent self-sufficient social units. Hashimoto's work similarly helps to explain why, with its emphasis on contingency, autonomy, independence, and conjugal ties, American society has failed to develop a system, either formal or informal, that guarantees adequate support for all of its elderly.
