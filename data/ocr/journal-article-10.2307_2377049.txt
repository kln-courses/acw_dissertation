J URISTS, like philosophers and artists, have always divided themselves into idealists and realists. Ideal- ists are those who are so impressed with the ideal order, which visible things only partly embody, that they are charged with neglecting the poor brute facts. The realists are so impressed with the hard actual facts, especially the unpleasant ones, that they are charged with neglecting the possibilities of change or improvement inherent in things. These differences seem to be primarily differences of emphasis, due to differences of temperament, but external conditions make one or other tendency predominate for a time. Up to a few years ago idealism held almost complete sway among teachers of philosophy in American univer- sities, and our legal thought was dominated exclusively by a naive idealism which saw nothing in the law but justice and the accumulated reason of mankind. It has been suggested that the Hegelian idealistic philosophy was peculiarly fitted for an academic class,2 and this is all the more probable when we remember the strength of the theologic or genteel tradition in American Academic life.3 Thus we find beneath the idealism of both lawyers and philosophers the realistic motive of defending the estab- lished order,-witness the writings of William T. Harris, Ladd, and the followers of Caird, as well as the numerous books and articles in our law reviews written by men whose lives have been spent defending the interests of property. It would be interesting to trace the similarity of motives which led to the rise of a juristic realism in the writings of lawyers like Brooks Adams or Bentley, and the various 1 Read at the Conference on Legal and Social Philosophy at Columbia University, Nov. 26,1915. 2Talbert, The Dualism of Fact and Idea in its Social Implication, Pound. 24 Harvard Law Review, 600. 3 Santayana, Winds of Doctrine.</page><page sequence="2">348 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. forms of protesting realism among the younger American philosophers. But that would carry us beyond the point I wish to make, which is, that in actual men the idealistic and realistic motives so interpenetrate that a sharp classi- fication is apt to be superficial and misleading. Never- theless, for purposes of understanding, such distinctions are indispensable, at least as starting points. If, thus warned, we look for the realistic and idealistic motives in legal thought we find them in the conflicting views that law is reason or justice, and that law is force, the will of the sovereign, or the interest of the stronger or dominant class. The controversy between these two views has raged so often since Plato to his own satis- faction refuted the view of Thrasymachus that justice is the interest of the stronger, that it may seem hopeless to try to add anything. Nevertheless I believe progress may be made, not by the easy refutation of one side or other, but by a careful analysis of the factors in the situ- ation on which the opposing claims are based. This is certainly not so interesting as the method of sweeping refutation, but its results, though meager, may be more sub- stantial. In nearly all modern jural and political discussion that styles itself scientific, law is defined as the will of the sov- ereign. Now if the sovereign, whoever or whatever that may be, is not the omnipotent himself but some human being or group, it is clear that there are limitations upon that will. Not even in autocratic Russia does everything happen in accordance with the will of the sovereign. Not only are many laws not enforced or obeyed, but the sov- ereign finds it impossible to express his will in the law it- self. The Russian sovereign undoubtedly wants all his subjects to be patriotic and Greek Orthodox; he would give a great deal to get rid of his troublesome Jewish and Mo- hammedan subjects. But, while he may restrict them, he cannot make a law to get rid of them altogether-any more than he can make the Russian church Protestant or make its language French. Legally, of course, there may be</page><page sequence="3">"REAL" AND "IDEAL" FORCES. 349 nothing to prevent him-if from the legal standpoint any enactment of the sovereign, no matter how absurd or in- capable of enforcement, is law. But that merely shows the limitation of the purely legal standpoint; for obviously in making the law, the sovereign, if he has any intelligence, will avoid enacting rules which cannot be enforced and which can only serve to show his impotence. Thus all intelligent law-making rests on the knowledge or estimate of what will be obeyed. The perception of this fact has led to the theory that all law rests on the consent, acknowl- edgement or obedience of the subjects.4 This, however, overlooks the fact that in the freest commonwealth laws are obeyed which many people bitterly and emphatically resent. It is true that when I obey a law because of fear or external compulsion, I may still be said to exercise my sovereign prerogative of choice, since I may choose not to obey and take the unpleasant consequences. Neverthe- less there is a real difference here-the difference between contributing to a relief fund and contributing to a high- wayman or to a hostile invader. There is thus an empirical basis for the distinction between the part of the law founded on force (or external compulsion)5 and the part that appeals to us as inherently just or natural. Though realists and idealists have long disputed as to the relative importance of these external and internal factors in the law, it ought to be obvious that the proportion between them varies according to time and place; and it would be vain to try to settle it a priori. It is an historical question to be settled by empirical, statistical information. Few thoughtful jurists would to-day accept the extreme realistic position of Lassalle, and idealistic anarchists, who believe that the law rests exclusively on the police and the militia. While it is true that a small organized minority 4Bierling, Zur Kritik der Juristischen Grundbegriffe, I, pp. 66, 134 sq., II, 351 sq.; Juristische Prinzipienlehre, II, pp. 3 sq. 5 Following the usage of sociologists I use the term force (when otherwise unqualified) in the remainder of this paper to denote any determining factor, ordinary usage, also, employs such expressions as "the force of his arguments," etc.</page><page sequence="4">350 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. can overawe and compel obedience from a large unorgan- ized majority, it is not a fact that the majority of people in any existent community under a civil law feel themselves in the position of a crowd of unarmed men held up by a lone bandit. The amount of awe and veneration for those in authority is too widespread even among the most op- pressed classes.6 Contrary to the anarchistic analysis, also, most people prefer to obey rather than take the in- itiative and responsibility of commanding. The police and militia cannot possibly explain why the bulk of the civil law is obeyed; because -the very existence of a modern military or police force depends upon a general habit of obedience and respect for law in the coummunity. If most men preferred to settle their disputes with axes or pis- tols instead of by means of an expensive legal duel, a modern police force would be utterly futile. Moreover, there is some truth in the contention that the state or sovereign does not order any one to obey the rules of the civil law. The state does not order any one to keep his contracts, to register his deed, to attest his will or refrain from slander- ing his neighbor. The rules of the civil law are rules for settling private disputes. The state supports the judg- ment of the judge to a very limited extent-mainly by dis- posing of some of the goods (if there are any) of the one against whom judgment has been rendered. This dis- tinction may seem to be very thin, but it calls our attention to the important fact that where private interests of in- dividuals do not demand it there will be no enforcement of the law. Private interests (which include matters of honor, the desire for revenge, or satisfaction of outraged justice) thus supply the motive force. The sanctions of the civil law take this force for granted and regulate it just as river works regulate the current but presuppose gravity as the motive force. These considerations seem obvious enough. Yet all the controversies between those who hold the imperative theory and those who hold the declarative theory of the law may 6 See Hume's Essays (Green and Grose), I, 110.</page><page sequence="5">"REAL" AND "IDEAL" FORCES. 351 be traced to an overemphasis of what we have called the regulative and motive forces. When we come to consider the law as a regulative force and the factors which make it what it is, realistic jurists rely on political or economic power-the idealists on reason and justice. Now it ought to be clear that these factors cannot be mutually exclusive, since for the most part they move on different levels. Moreover, in the absence of a quantitive social science enabling us to measure in some definite way the relative weights of different factors, it seems as futile to discuss which is more potent, economics or ethics, as it would have been to discuss the question which is more powerful, heat or electricity, before the dis- covery of the correlation of energies. Nevertheless, these one-sided views, that law is determined exclusively by po- litical, economic, logical or ethical forces, are with us and the task of criticising these theories cannot be dispensed with. The political interpretation of law need not detain us long, since it is clearly in the field of legislation that po- litical forces find their primary expression, and legislation is a subordinate factor in civil law. I do not mean to deny the important place of legislation in the development of our property law, nor the way the legislation of our day is transforming the law of industrial and commercial rela- tions. But legislation becomes effective in the body politic only after it has been digested by the process of juristic interpretation and judicial decision. And while it would be folly to maintain that the political convictions of judges never find expression in the law, it seems a fact that jurists and judges do not always represent a sufficiently homogeneous political interest to make the influence of their unconscious political bias the predominant one in the law. The economic interpretation of law takes its starting point from the perception of the fact that the great bulk of the law deals with economic interests or interests having an economic value. When this is combined with the im-</page><page sequence="6">352 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. perative theory of law and a very simple division of society into the dominant class and what may be called the subject class, we have the views of Loria and Brooks Adams,7 according to whom law is the expression of the economic interests of the dominant class. In the orthodox Marxian system this is attached to a system of Hegelian dialectics, in which the system of economic production acquires all the potency of the Hegelian Absolute Idea generating all social institutions. The adherents of this view have been able to bring forward relatively few in- stances from legal history or from the actual law of to-day that are indisputably examples of class interests express- ing themselves in the law. This argument, however, is not conclusive. Legal history is a biased witness, since most existing legal histories have been written by ideal- ogists who, ignoring all non-legal factors, have written the history of the law as if it were a continuous exercise in which juristic logic were the sole determining factor. A concrete example will make this clear. Professor Burdick has written a learned article attacking the validity of several illustrations of Brooks Adams' that the law is determined by the interests of the dominant class. Pro- fessor Burdick's procedure consists in showing that there were plenty of precedents and logical reasons for the judges deciding as they did. Obviously, however, this utterly fails to disprove Mr. Adams' contention, since the existence of a good logical reason does not preclude the co-existence of a real economic one. To disprove the existence of unconscious economic bias as a determining factor, Professor Burdick would have to show that equally good reasons and precedents could not possibly have been ad- duced on the other side; and that is out of the question, since the law is not a closed logical system like pure mathe- matics, in which every proposition is absolutely necessi- tated. Was there ever a case carried up to a higher court 7Loria, Economic Foundations of Society; Brooks Adams, Theory of Social Revolutions, and Centralization and Law, Lects. I, II. 8 25 Harvard Law Review 349.</page><page sequence="7">"REAL" AND "IDEAL" FORCES. 353 where the losing side did not have reasons and precedents on its side? Legal reasoning depends on multitudes of as- sumptions, based on experience and judgments as to public policy. The fellow-servant rule, which Professor Burdick defends, was decided by Lord Abinger and Chief Justice Shaw expressly on ground of public policy. If the dele- gate of a butcher boys' union or a brakemen's association were the judge, would he have had the same view of public policy? It would be foolish to maintain that, in view of the criticisms which the rule in question has received from the ablest and best trained legal minds.9 When lawyers speak of a decision as being necessitated by logic, that the judges could not have helped making the particular decision which they did, it is because they accept all the premises on which the decision is based. But while all this is true, it is absurd to say that juristic logic has no influence at all in making decisions what they are. Only a fanatic devotion to the logical consequence of a preconceived theory could induce people so to ignore human experience as to deny that man generally, and legislators and judges in particular, are ever influenced by reasons and arguments. If economic interests as Mr. Adams tells law students, are bound to express themselves in the law as much as the earth is bound to pursue its path around the sun, why teach law at all? Obviously, the legally trained mind decides differently from one not so trained. Indeed, the whole theory of economic determinism ap- plied to the law illustrates the powerful influence of popular theories as to what science is. It is popularly supposed that there is a physical force, gravity, which does something to keep all the planets in their proper places. This con- ception of force, however, is an anthropomorphic survival of primitive animism. Careful modern physicists do not 9 Pollock, Genius of the Common Law 104-105, Holmes, 12 Harvard Law Re- view 456, and Dicey, Law and Public Opinion 280. Indeed, the Scotch courts did rule differently (Sword v. Cameron, 1 Dunlap 493) until overruled by the English House of Lords in the Bartonshill cases, and in Merry v. Wilson.</page><page sequence="8">354 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. use force in any such sense. Indeed, there is a very marked tendency to give up the notion of force altogether.1o At any rate, actual physics offers no analogy for a system dominated by a single force; and, as Aristotle pointed out, it is a sign of lack of scientific culture to try to carry over the exactness of mathematics and physics into fields where they do not apply (because of absence of exact measure- ments). Certainly, no one surveying the facts of our complicated social system without a preconceived theory would see in it a single dominant class. Social and eco- nomic conflicts take place along many different lines, and these lines, like the line in employer and employee, Catholics and Protestants, agriculturists and manufac- turers, North and South, cross and recross each other. The law is designed to be the means of regulating these con- flicts. As a matter of fact, the bulk of the civil law does not deal with any special class interests at all, but rather with private arrangements in which the members of the dominant class, whatever that may be, may sometime be more interested than others. The law of contracts, mort- gages, sales, and wills, laws against fraud, seduction, as- sault and slander, marriage laws, divorce laws, and the like, are certainly not imposed upon an unwilling popu- lation by a dominant class. Professor Pound has actually shown" how considerations of juristic logic and consist- ency have led, as in the case of the law of partnerships, to results directly contrary to the interests of the commer- cial class, which is supposed to be the dominant one. Similar considerations are true with regard to ethics. It must be granted that ethical ideas as to right and wrong are somewhat plastic, that men readily convince themselves that what is to their interest is just. This is facilitated by the way in which given groups habitually 10 Herz Principles of Mechanics. Introd. Russell, Principles of Mathe- matics, 482 says: "The first thing to be remembered is-what physicists nowadays will scarcely deny-that force is a mathematical fiction, not a physi- cal entity." 11 24 Harvard Law Review 603-4 and 25 Harvard Law Review 167.</page><page sequence="9">"REAL" AND "IDEAL" FORCES. 355 identify their interests with that of the whole community. Thus, the working classes habitually speak of themselves as the people; the middle classes think of their interests as the interests of the public; while the commercial classes always refer to their interests as those of the country. Yet for all that, it is absurd to deny the fact that ethical ideals have been powerful factors in making the law. Indeed, when we survey the history of the law, it would seem that religion has moulded the greatest part in the law under which mankind lives. Religious conceptions, for instance, have had more to do with making our marriage laws than anything else. It is religious conception which prevents euthanasia. The changed attitude of the law as to the relation between husband and wife, which marks the nineteenth century, is not, as a matter of fact, due to any economic change, but part of the general movement of humanization, which shows itself also in our attitude to the criminal, the insane, and the helpless. Whether we take the pretorian law, English equity, or the influence of seventeenth and eighteenth century natural law on inter- national law, constitutional law, and criminal law, we everywhere find ethical ideals exercising profound influence, apart from, and often contrary to, the interest of the class which the jurists represent. All this, of course, does not impugn the great importance of economics in law, both as determining the social interests to be safeguarded and the incidence of judicial decision. But the true relation of juristic technique to economics is, I apprehend, similar to the relation of the technique of the engineer to economics. Bridges are built and their location and material determined by economic reasons, but the technique of the engineer is independent of economics. The modern tendency to belittle the importance of logic, known as anti-intellectualism, is part of the reaction against the old liberalism which rested on a rationalistic basis. Legal liberalism as represented by a man like Coke viewed the law as the dictate of reason, just as the adherents of the enlightenment tried to prove all things. But we know</page><page sequence="10">356 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. that all things cannot be proved, since proof rests on as- sumptions; and reason cannot determine the whole law because reason has to do with judgments (determining the appropriateness of means to end) and cannot determine the ultimate ends which are a matter of ultimate choice. Hobbes is, therefore, right in putting will above reason in the law. But when we have said that reason determines the means appropriate to a given end, we have by no means belittled the importance of reason, for the means at our disposal, as I have tried to show on another occasion,12 very frequently determine the ends which we are to choose. A study of juristic logic, therefore, would be of the greatest assistance in determining the relative places of the impera- tive and the rational elements in the law. Logicians have neglected this task because the logic of imperatives has not been developed.-3 It must be noted, however, that legal propositions are logically imperative only in the sense in which the directions in a guide book are imperative. The proposition "take the car going to the north" is grammati- cally an imperative sentence, and logicians have excluded such sentences from the category of propositions. In point of fact, however, this imperative is based upon a judgment that the taking of such a car is necessary to reach the desired end. That is, if you want to get there, you must take the car. The subjunctive clause being understood, is not expressed. Similarly, the law says if you want your title or right secured, you must register your deed, give notice, etc. The legislator also, in his enactments, makes judgments that certain situations will arise and that if certain arrangements or provisions are made, certain conse- quences will follow. It may be urged that the logical ques- tion, whether these conclusions do or do not follow, is imma- terial to the enforcement of the law, that if the legislator is mistaken in his judgment, those charged with the enforce- 12Journal of Philosophy, April 10, 1914. 13A beginning has been made by Zitlemann, Irrtum und Rechtsgeschdft, pp. 220 sq.; W.

We cannot eliminate the judg- ment from the law, because those who have to enforce the law must be guided by this judgment in order to determine the actual contents of the law. The process of judicial in- terpretation, which is necessary for making all legislation effective, cannot be worked out by mere fiats. It must use a developed logical machinery. It must act under rules of justice (whose content is determined by social science). It must also invent modes of adjustment on the basis of logi- cal distinctions. The abuse of logical distinctions fre- quently leads to the vicious results of Begriffsjurisprudenz.'4 But this does not mean that the use of logical distinctions can be dispensed with. I have not the time to develop here the technique of ethical judgments, which are equally important in the development of the law. I may barely mention one ob- jection against the fruitfulness of the principles of ethics or natural law in jurisprudence suggested by Planiol.15 He enumerates several principles of natural law or justice, and then intimates that such principles will not carry us far in the development of the concrete law e. g. of mortgages. Now, it is perfectly true that if you look at these principles by themselves, very little of the law of mortgages can be de- duced from them. But so also if you look at the axioms of geometry in their abstract form. Few concrete geometric propositions could be deduced from them immediately. This, however, does not mean that these principles are not operative. Principles of justice are assumed in almost all branches of the law, but they are applied to the concrete material of social life, and the conclusion is based, there- fore, not merely upon ethics, but also on the factual judg- ments and the juristic technique which operates with them. The moral of my meagre tale is that the enforcement of the law, which Professor Pound rightly calls the life of 14See my article in the Harvard Law Review, April 1916. 15 Traits du droit civil I, pp. 2-3 cf. Demogue Les notions fondementales pp. 19-20. Vol. XXVI.-No. 3. 4</page><page sequence="12">358 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. the law, depends not only upon the maximum satisfaction of all the conflicting interests which enter into social life, but, also, that this, in turn, depends to some extent upon the scientific development of jurisprudence and ethics. This moral also has applications to the realms of public law and international affairs. Our constitutional law will be- come effective only so long as it recognizes itself as a means for bringing about social adjustment between conflicting claims, not by mere fiat, but by a scientific determination of interests in accordance with prevalent feelings of right and justice. Our labor troubles in Colorado, and the threat of civil war in connection with the Irish Home Rule prob- lem, show the breakdown of a constitutionalism which does not take count of the actual demands and aspirations of dif- ferent classes. Similarly with regard to international af- fairs. It has become the fashion to laugh at international law and to deny that it is in any sense law, because of the absence of an international police. But if it is true that there are other forces besides the police which make the law, there is no reason why considerations above deduced from private law may not apply to international law. MORRIS R.
