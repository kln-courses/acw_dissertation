New York: Free Presswj973. 470 pp. Part One supplies several basic treatments of archetypal theory, by Maud Bodkin, Leslie Fiedler, Erich Fromm, William Goode, Sir James Frazer, and Northrop Frye; Part Two supplies excerpts from world literature, ancient and modern, on various phases of the life cycle; Part Three does the same for archetypal characters—heroes and anti heroes, the wise fool, the devil figure, the out cast, the double, the scapegoat, and the temptress. There is a glossary and a selective bibliography; and, of course, biblical literature is well rep resented throughout. [VRM] 3505 Cafferata, John. Ri tes. New York; McGraw Hill, 1975. 525 pp. An anthology of poetry and prose which sets the Bible in the context of myths ancient and modern, under these various topics: rites of passage; rites of separation; rites of initiation: a second birth; rites of word magic; and rites of renewal: from death to immortality. Beautiful format and illustrations, incisive introductions and study questions. [VRM] 65</page><page sequence="4">3506 Forbes, Cheryl.

New York: Harcourt Brace Javanovich, 1973. 304 pp. An anthology of world mythology, with ancient Greek, Chinese, African, and Indian myths retold by modern authors and with ample selections from recent authors. The Bible is conspicuously absent. [VRM] 3509 Lee, Alvin A., and Hope Arnott Lee. The Garden and the Wilderness. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1973. 320 pp. An anthology of selected biblical writings combined with nonbiblical literary selections intended to demonstrate "the immediate power and importance of the Bible as literature for our own time and place in history." Selections are grouped around the creation and fall, the flood and dawn of his tory, the Abraham stories, the Joseph narrative, and the Moses stories. [VRM] 3510 Levi, Pater. The English Bible 1534 to 1859. Grand Rapids, Mich.: William B. Eerdmans, 1974. 222 pp., $6.95. An anthology of excerpts from Tyndale's version (1534), Cover dale's (1535), Matthew's Bible (1537), John 66</page><page sequence="5">Fisher's work (publ. 1545), The Great Bible (1539), the Geneva Bible (1560), The Bishops' Bible (1568), the extremely scarce original version of the Douai-Rheims version of Gregory Martin (1582 and 1609-10), the Authorized Version (1611), Hugh Broughton's work (posthumous publ., 1662), John Carryl's work (1700), Edward Harwood's New Testa ment (1768), Ben Franklin's anti-monarchic joke version of Job 1 (1779), and William Barnes' Dorset dialect version of the Song of Solomon (1859). An outspoken and intelligent introduc tion points out the stylistic shortcomings of the Authorized Version and opts for the Geneva Bible as the version which "more than any other makes a continuous and passionate sense of the Bible." Levi, tutor of classics at Oxford, has no time for the stylistic infelicities of modern English versions. [VRM] 3511 Oleyar, Rita. The Jesus Myth. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. 55"pp. The introduc tion explains the title: "the essential facts found in the Gospels have been magnified into a mythology—a cluster of ideas, assumptions, and beliefs about human existence which form an inte gral and active part of our civilization." Then follows discussion of myth, legend, and history, explanation concerning reading the Bible as lit erature, and a specific study of the Last Supper viewed literarily, psychologically, sociologically, and theologically. Quotations follow from the four Gospels, with comparison-passages from such authors as Pasternak and Kazantzakis, excellent study questions, and an annotated bibliography. [VRM] 3512 Oleyar, Rita. The Job Story. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. 68 pp. An introduc tion explains how to study Job, Job as a psycho logical quest, and the "descent into Hell" motif. Then follows the text of Job, divided into five sections, each with its own title. Each section 67</page><page sequence="6">is followed by a set of searching and challenging study questions, including an exercise in which the student is asked to make specific comparison between an excerpt from Robert Frost's "Masque of Reason" (text provided) and Job 38-42. Philo sophical themes are listed; the book is discussed both as an epic and as Greek Tragedy; and minor literary forms (fiction, wisdom literature, auto biography) are pointed out, as are the patternings of figures and images. Since Job addresses the question of the nature of man, excerpts from Shakespeare's Hamlet, Milton's Samson Agonistes, Pope's Essay on Man, and Twain's Reflections on Religion are supplied with questions requiring close analysis and comparison. The pamphlet con cludes with several basic questions, each of them supplied with several student answers in order to demonstrate the alternative possible approaches; and there is a bibliography. [VRM] 3513 Oleyar, Rita. Myths of Creation and Fall. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. 48 pp. Concentrates on now to read the Bible as part of "cross-cultural mythic literature." The approach is respectful and non-inflammatory: "The secular approach—which will be strange to many of you who regard the Bible as sacred literature--wil1, it is hoped, not diminish in any way your pre conceived attitudes toward the Book of Books, but only deepen your appreciation of its very great worth as literature." The Judeo-Christian tradition is represented by Genesis 1-3; the classical view, by several prose translations from Hesiod and some sections from Ovid's Meta morphoses; Mesopotamian cosmogony, by the myth of Harduk and Tiamat, and other myths from the Rig Veda and from non literate ethnic groups. Each selection is accompanied by penetrating study questions; and a final section is full of stimulating suggestions for research projects, discussions, and creative projects. There is a solid annotated bibliography. [VRM] 68</page><page sequence="7">3514 Simonson, Harold P. "On Bridging Modern Literature and Religion," Renascence, XXVI (Autumn 1973), 15-23. Though much of modern lit erature exists on the level of "religious style, nonreligious content," and some important modern authors grapple with one or more of the great themes of theology, art neither encompasses the religious vision nor does it incarnate it. Cer tain distinctions between the literary and reli gious experience make any bridge between them tentative and perhaps impossible. OLD AND MIDDLE ENGLISH 3515 Brockman, Bennett A. "Heroic and Christian in Genesis A: The Evidence of the Cain and Abel Episode," MLQ, 35 (1974), 115-128. The Cain and Abel episode in the Genesis A fragment demon strates that "the Old English poet was impressed much more by biblical history, by a new store of legends intelligible within the ancient Germanic social and moral framework, than by exegetical theology" of the Patristic writers. Human appeal of the honorless exile takes precedence over theology. [MH] 3516 Burrow, J. A. "Henryson: The Preaching of the Swallow," EIC, 25 (Jan. 1975), 25-37. One of the best of Henryson's fables, this is concerned with the nature of time and prudence. Prudence is necessary and admissible for the wise man insofar as God Himself, utterly aware of his creation at all points in time, is therefore per fectly prudent. [LB] 3517 Lawrence, Barbara Jane. "A Computerized Metrical Analysis of Cynewulfian Poetry," DA, 34 (Feb. 1974), 5184-5A (St. Louis U.). The known Cynewulfian poems, Elene, Juliana, Christ II, and Fates of the Apostles, were scanned according to Bliss's refinement of Sievers' method. Their scansion was compared to that of three unsigned 69</page><page sequence="8">poems, Th£ Wanderer, The Seafarer, and Jhf? Battle of Maldon. The tests neither prove or disprove Cynewulf's authorship of these last poems, but "they do reaffirm the belief in a Cynewulfian 'school of poetry.1" [FPM] 3518 Nevins, Madeline Marie. "Le Jeu d'Adam: Its Unity and Complexity," DA, 34 (Feb. 1974), 5197A (Tufts U.). Le Jeu d'Adam, instead of giving a representation of the Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel stories and the Procession of the Prophets, gives an interpretation of these texts which "focuses on the mystery of man's Redemption rather than on man's origin." The allegory of the play (everyman in a struggle with temptation), the tropological lesson (doctrine concerning sin and temptation), and the typology of the play (the presence of Christ the Savior) give the play its unity. [FPM] SIXTEENTH CENTURY 3519 Battenhouse, Roy. "Falstaff as Parodist and Perhaps Holy Fool," PMLA, 90 (Jan. 1975), 32-52. The article explores the mediaeval tradition of the wise fool and Falstaff's "always canny use of biblical allusion," and suggests that Falstaff may be "a candle to his age, a professional Fool with the heart of a faithful Lazarus, and destined to join Mowbray in Abraham's bosom." [TH] 3520 Dessen, Alan C. "The Elizabethan Stage Jew and Christian Example: Gerontus, Barabus, and Shy lock,: MLQ_&gt; 35 (1974), 231-245. The "stage Jew" in Wilson's The Three Ladies in London, Mar lowe's The Jew of Malta, and Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice functions "as a dramatic scalpel with which the English dramatist could anatomize the inner reality of a society Christian in name but not necessarily in deed." [MH] 70</page><page sequence="9">3521 Jorgensen, Paul A. "A Formative Shakespear ean Legacy: Elizabethan Views of God, For tune, and War," PMLA, 90 (March 1975), 222-233. Elizabethan notions on the relationship between God, Fortune, and War shaped Shakespeare's han dling of "the conflicting demands of supernatural control and human resourcefulness" (esp. the battles in the history tetralogies). His later tragedies attempt "resolutions deeper than those of military victory or defeat." [TH] 3522 Matthews, Richard. "Edmund's Redemption in King Lear," SQ, 26 (Winter 1975), 25-29. Edmund's deathbed conversion is real, though late, partial, and immensely costly. In fact, it comes, in some sense, as a Pyrrhic effect of Cordelia's sacrifice. Like Lear, Edmund comes to a vision of love. [LB] 3523 Pecheux, Mother M. Christopher, O.S.U. "Another Note on 'This Fell Sergeant, Death'," sg, 26 (Winter 1975), 74-75. Hamlet's phrase (5.2.347-8) derives from the tradition of the Dance of Death, realized in Shakespeare's day by the famous St. Paul's mural, and in Lyd gate's Dance of Death and The Assembly of Gods. [LB] — SEVENTH CENTURY 3524 Bedford, R. D. "Similes of Unlikeness in Paradise Lost," EIC, 25 (April 1975), 179 196. Milton at least suggests that the Incarna tion, and the pattern of self-sacrificial love it epitomizes, is copied by the very human ex periences it redeems: "there are significant moments in Paradise Lost when enduring insights and intimations of what Eden embodies are present even on 'the subjected plain' we inhabit. . . [LB] 71</page><page sequence="10">3525 Berry, Boyd M. "Puritan Soldiers in Paradise Lost," MLQ, 35 (1974), 376-402. Puritan military sermons shed light on the inconclusive battles in Paradise Lost. The verb 'standing' demonstrates Puritan heroism: "the faithful . . . rejoice to maintain an erect physical posture, to expend effort, to rest, to witness God's glorious triumph, and to keep the faith." The victory is God's alone, and cannot be finally won by human struggle. [MH] 3526 Bourdette, Robert E. Jr. "Recent Studies in Henry Vaughan," ELR, 4 (1974), 299-310. Bibliographical listing of biographical, textual, and critical studies of Vaughan from 1945 to 1973. [MH] 3527 Bozanich, Robert. "Donne and Ecclesiastes," PMLA, 90 (March 1975), 270-276. The effects of Donne's readings in Ecclesiastes around 1608, when he was depressed, are apparent in his Anni versaries and, in fact, in most of his later work. m 3528 Christopher, Georgia B. "The Verbal Gate to Paradise: Adam's 'Literary Experience' in Book X of Paradise Lost," PMLA, 90 (Jan. 1975), 69-77. Adam's perception of his sentence as a promise is "the sacramental moment toward which the action of Paradise Lost is leading, and re flects the Reformers' understanding that the first promise (protevangelium) . . . constitues an inner scripture that equalizes all ages." [TH] 3529 Clark, Ira. "Christ on the Tower in Paradise Regained," MiltonQ, VIII (Dec. 1974), 104-07. The temptation on the tower is critical and cli mactic in Paradise Regained because it symbolizes Christ's paradoxical kenosis. At his weakest, in the middle air, Satan's domain, he conquers. [J ES] 72</page><page sequence="11">3530 Dees, Jerome S. "Recent Studies in Traherne,' ELR, 4 (1974), 189-196. Bibliographical listing of biographical, critical and textual studies of Traherne from 1945 to 1971. [MH] 3531 Garber, Marjorie B. "Fallen Landscape: The Art of Milton and Poussin," ELR, 5 (1975), 96-124. Both poet and painter deal with mytho logical figures allegorically understood and "fallen landscapes" (focusing on real world rather than Golden Age) emphasizing "a rational assess ment of man's role in the fallen world" and the "necessity for facing the adversary." Iconograph ical parallels between the two artists are demon strated by plates of Poussin's work. [MH] 3532 Hill, John Spencer. "Servant of God: The Theme of Divine Vocation in Milton," DA, 34 (Feb. 1974), 5174-5A (U. of Toronto), From 1550 to 1650 the doctrine of special election extended to the nation of Britain where it was accepted that God had chosen this country as His spokesman and the instrument of His will, a divine favor inherited from the Hebrew tradition. Eng land was to be the new Israel, and its people the chosen ones. The manifestations of divine voca tion in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are: 1) the idea of secular vocation as divine calling, 2) the providential sense of English history, 3) the theory of monarchical divine right, 4) the concept of clerical calling, 5) the notion of literary vocation. These various forms of divine vocation are a conceptual core which unify Milton's works as we see him reject a ministerial vocation but become more prophetic in his literary calling. He believed he was "God's chosen mouthpiece and the prose prophet of the national mission." In the last six books of Paradise Lost, in Paradise Regained, and in Samson Agönistes, Adam, Christ, and Samson are educated in the limits of power and in the voca tional expectations imposed upon them, just as 73</page><page sequence="12">Milton had to learn what it meant to be an instru ment of God's will. [FPM] 3533 Hülse, Lloyd Kermit. "Edicion Critica Y Estudio de La Cena del Rey Balthasar de Calderon de la BarcaTH^., 34~fFeb. 1974), 5177A (University of Cincinnati). This critical edition of Calderon's sacramental "auto" play, based on the Old Testament episode in Daniel V, discusses the previous dramatic treatment of the same sub ject and reviews earlier editions and studies of the play, gives the complete text of the princeps edition with changes in neither punctuation nor spelling, and critically compares this text with other manuscripts and with twentieth-centuray editions. [FPM] 3534 Hunter, William B. "John Milton: Auto biographer," MiltonQ, VIII (Dec. 1974), 100-104. Milton's Poems of 1673 and his attempt to publish all his prose indicate a desire for a spiritual biography akin to Bunyan's Grace Abound ing. Unlike Bunyan, Milton did not include the typically Calvinistic conversion experience, but rather the Arminian model of a steady life of spiritual service. [JFS] 3535 Kerrigan, William. "The Fearful Accomoda tions of John Donne," ELR, 4 (1974), 337 363. The anthropomorphism of Donne's sonnets "Batter my heart" and "Show me deare Christ" are put into the context of the Theory of Accomoda tion. The sonnets reach a dangerous extreme, portraying Christ as rapist and willing cuckold. Donne knew that "behind the merciful face of God lay another face twisted in wrath and capable of the most fearsome acts." [MH] 3536 Kerrigan, William. "The Heretical Milton: From Assumption to Mortal ism," ELR, 5 (1975), 126-166. Milton began with an early fascination with the doctrines of assumption, evidenced in 74</page><page sequence="13">"Comus" and "Lycidas." Between 1640 and 1660 Milton became a mortalist--a doctrine which also avoids the severance of body and spirit at death. Paradise Lost demonstrates the mortal ist heresy. IMH] 3537 Osmond, Rosalie. "Body and Soul Dialogues in the Seventeenth Century," ELR, 4 (1974), 364-403. Explains brief resurgence of this me dieval literary form in the seventeenth century by confusion between body and soul, flesh and spirit coupled with a "genuine concern with and belief in . . . sin, death, and the possibility of damnation." Dialogues disappeared as Deism replaced Puritanism, political debates replaced moral debates, and reason replaced revelation. [MH] 3538 Ryken, Lei and. "Milton's Dramatization of the Godhead in Paradise Lost," Mi 1tonQ, IX (March 1975), 1-6. Shows after much detailed evidence that Milton's ambiguous portrayal of the Godhead extends throughout the poem. Answers the question Why did Milton present God in this way? 1) to show God's transcendence, 2) because of his theology of the Godhead, 3) because of his biblical model. [JFS] EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 3539 Dillon, Ralph G. "Source for Blake's 'The Sick Rose'?" AN&amp;Q, XII, 9-10 (May-June, 1974), 157-158. Possible source for "The Sick Rose" is Jeremiah 4:30. The poem clearly echoes this scripture verse in its diction and in its theme of self-destructive hypocrisy. The biblical source meshes with Blake's contrary states of Innocence and Experience—with deceit the accom paniment of Experience. [MS] 3540 Empson, William. "A Deist Tract by Dryden," EIC, 25 (Jan. 1975), 74-100. Dryden is the 75</page><page sequence="14">probable author of a deist letter in response to a heterodox tract by Charles Blount. Blount's dedication of his tract to Dryden, read by Phillip Harth as ironic and scornful, is in fact "straight1 though humorous, and Dryden never denied its pro priety. [LB] * 3541 Ong, Walter J., S.J. "Gospel, Existence and Print," MLQ, 35 (1974), 66-77. Review article of Gale H. Carrithers, Jr., Donne at Sermons : A Christian Existential World (Albany: SUNY Press, 1972) and James Gray, Johnson's Ser mons : A Study (Oxford: Clarendon, 1972). Approach ing Donne's sermons from an existential perspective is appropriate because those sermons were wrung out of "emergent occasions"--the emergencies, stresses, and trials of Oonne's own life. John son's "ghost-written" sermons demonstrate that the written word was taking precedence over the spoken word; elocution replaced oratory. [MH] 3542 Williams, Aubray. "No Cloistered Virtue: Or, Playwright vs. Priest in 1698," PMLA, 90 (March 1975), 234-246. A perennially timely question is the portrayal of evil on the stage. Jeremy Collier is the "Platonist" who urges that evil must not be vividly portrayed lest it cor rupt us, and Congreve, in his rejoinder to Collier, is the "Aristotelian" who feels that the vivid portrayal of evil is necessary as a warning. [TH] 3543 Zimmermann, Everett. "Gulliver the Preacher," PMLA, 89 (Oct. 1974), 1024-1032. Swift is satirizing Gulliver's own motives as well as so ciety's guilt, by disclosing Gulliver's moral fervor as a pretense disguising his own guilt (cf. Swift's suggestion in his expository writ ings that moral fervor is often a disguise for inmoral motives). [TH] 76</page><page sequence="15">NINETEENTH CENTURY 3544 Abrams, M. H. "Coleridge's 'A Light in Sound': Science, Metascience, and Poetic Imagination," PAPS, 116 (1972), 458-476. The '"Eolian Harp"' quatrain "Coleridge added on an Errata sheet attached to Sybelline Leaves (1817)" reconciles in a "visionary moment" Coleridgean notions about Newtonian and German science, about rçystical experience, and his "interpretation of the biblical accounts of the creation and the Incarnation." 3545 Ashton, Thomas L. "Byronic Lyrics for David's Harp: The Hebrew Melodies," SEL, 12 (172), 665-681. "In those lyrics, the union of Jewish nationalism and a Calvinistically in clined understanding of the Old Testament yielded up Romantic metaphors of man and of man's condi tion." 3546 Boyle, Robert, S.J. "Hopkins' Use of 'Fancy'," VP, 10 (1972) 17-27. "The nun's Christian experience in confronting Christ, analogous to the experience of the poet in Part I of the poem and, indeed, of every successful Christian, lies beyond the competence of even a skillful and inspired fancy." 3547 Campbell, John Angus. "Nature, Religion and Emotion Response: A Reconsideration of Darwin's Affective Decline," 18 (Dec. 1974), 159-174. It has been asserted that as Darwin grew older, his affective response to art and nature declined. The former is true, the latter is not. Darwin's own writings and the testimony of associates provide evidence that he retained an affective appreciation of nature. For him science was an endeavor both moral and affective. [DX] 77</page><page sequence="16">3548 Dayton, Donald W. Five Sermons and a Tract by Luther Lee: Edited With An Introduction. Chicago: Holrad House, 1975. Pp. 13ËT! $3.00. For orders of 5 or more copies, $2.00 each. This book initiates a new publishing house, which will specialize in primary and secondary materials illustrating the conduction of nineteenth-century revivalism and social reform. Luttier Lee's writings were a perfect choice for the pilot volume. Three of the sermons were preached at the death of key figures in the abolitionist movement: Elijah P. Lovejoy, Charles Turner Torrey, and John Brown. Taken together, they demonstrate the gradual move ment of anti-slave factions from early adherence to law and order, to Civil Disobedience of the Fugitive Slave Law, to acceptance of violence and revolution just before the outbreak of the Civil War. A fourth sermon, preached at the ordination of Antoinette Brown, the first woman to achieve full ordination in America, illustrates the inter connections between abolitionism and feminism. The fifth, an argument for prohibition, gives in sight into the temperance movement. The tract, entitled "Slavery: A Sin Against God," well demon strates the Wesleyan insight that social and po litical injustices are not simply problems for secular humanists, but ultimately are theological and spiritual concerns. Since Luther Lee was the founder of the abo litionist Wesleyan Methodist Connection of America (the oldest branch of the present Wesleyan Church), the volume is important for those interested in Methodist history as well as in the history of feminism, the temperance movement, abolitionism, or America in general. It forms part of the out standing work of Donald W. Dayton and Lucille Si der Dayton: raising public consciousness about the extensive precedent which has long existed for concerned evangelical social action. To teachers of literature, probably the most interesting sermon is the one on John Brown, en titled "Dying to the Glory of God," corroborating 78</page><page sequence="17">as it does the judgment of Henry David Thoreau that John Brown was in many ways a Christ figure. Lee said that Brown had t&gt;een hanged "for his efforts on behalf of the oppressed, and yet those efforts were the efforts of an honest man, a hero and a christian, and such a man, dying for such a cause, can be nothing but a martyr. . . . The murdered body of John Brown sleeps the sleep that shall know no waking till the resurrection morn, but his noble spirit lives in a million hearts, by whom freedom's battle shall be pushed to its final triumph." People wishing to order the volume may write directly to Holrad House, 5104 N. Christiana Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60625. [VRM] 3549 Deneau, Daniel P. "Coleridge's 'Limbo': A 'Riddling Tale'?" WÇ, 3 (1972), 97-105. "The uncertainty of the overall design . . . may be a result of Coleridge's struggle to express personal fears and anxieties, or 'existential dread,' in impersonal terms and in a theological framework." 3550 Eagleton, Terry. "Class, Power, and Char lotte Bronte," CritQ, 14 (1972), 225-235. The basic conflict between the "romantically affirmative and submissively conventional" selves is played out on various levels of Bronte's novels, including her ambivalent feelings about religion in general and "Evangelical discipline" in par ticular. 3551 Ewbank, David R. "Bishop Blougram's Argu ment," VP, 10 (1972), 257-263. Blougram's argument, undertaken to still the doubts he feels but sees objectified in Gigadibs, is full of argumentative fallacies. "Further, Blougram's basic premise that it is not his business to re make himself is obviously an un-Christian one." The Bishop's ultimate character is thus devious and deceptively attractive. 79</page><page sequence="18">3552 Gilpin, George H. "Coleridge and the Spiral of Poetic Thought," SEL, 12 (1972), 639-652. "The spiraling form given to his own poetic ex pression images for Coleridge the creating Logos and climaxes in a central celebration of the 'one Life' which is the wholeness of nature. Coleridge's poetry has the significant form and metaphysical content of a rite; it functions morally to involve and to delight the reader in an experience of the beauty and order of God's creation." 3553 Giordano, Frank R., Jr. "The Repentant Magdalen in Thomas Hardy's 'The Woman I Met,'" ELT, 15 (1972), 136-143. "The modern characters represent Christ and Mary Magdalen. The failure of their affair permits Hardy to consider the inadequacy of human forms of love for reconciling lovers; on the allegorical level, the failure represents the inadequacy of Chris tianity in modern times." 3554 Higdon, David L. "The Iconographie Back grounds of Adam Bede, Chapter 15," NCF, 27 (1972), 155-170. Eliot designs her descriptions of women characters in terms of traditional icon ographie pictures of luxuria or saintliness; she may have derived these descriptions from Quarles emblems. 3555 Hollenbach, John W. "The Image of the Arab in Nineteenth-Century English and American Literature," MW, 62 (1972), 195-208. Most nine teenth-century treatments were severely unsympa thetic, largely because of "Christian bias and decidedly English values." 3556 Johnson, Michael L. "Hopkins, Heraclitus, Cosmic Instress and of the Comfort of the Resurrection," VP, 10 (1972), 235-242. "In the sonnet's turn and resolution this world-picture is synthesized with that of Hopkins' Scotist Christianity to shape a hope of man's redemption 80</page><page sequence="19">from fallen nature. . . . the Heraclitean world fire is analogous to the light of the Christian God. ..." 3557 Kirk, Carey H. "Checkmating Bishop Blougram," VP, 10 (1972), 265-271. The game-like quality of Browning's poem suggests the nature of his bishop's enigmatic personality. "Blougram's superior wit successfully maintains the hierar chical, essentially medieval social order often represented allegorically by the game of chess, but since the bishop can no longer depend on an unquestioned faith in a universal church, he must achieve dominance by his intellectual merit rather than by any given ethical position." 3558 Langbaum, Robert. "Is Guido Saved? The Meaning of Browning's Conclusion to The Ring and the Book," VP, 10 (1972), 289-305. ". T . Browning has planted so many signposts pointing toward Guido's salvation that if the salvation does not come off the signposts lead to nothing and the poem to that extent fails. . . . To see Guido as saved is to understand the poem's design. ... It is to understand the poem's rel ativism, that all selves are justified as part of God's scheme." 3559 Levy, Raphael. "In Abraham's Bosom: Words worth's Religious Outlook," DA, 34 (Feb. 1974), 5185A (U. of Pennsylvania). Wordsworthian religious attitudes have greater unity than is usually granted. Imagination for Wordsworth was prophetic in form, and "eternal nature is presented in providential terms, displays the qualities affirmed in the prophetic conception of Divine immanence, and cannot be identified with the Deus sive Natura of Spinoza." Wordsworth's sense of vocation is similar to that of the Hebrew prophets and he emphasizes, as they do, the im portance of "sublimity and freedom from bondage 81</page><page sequence="20">to definite form in the experience and awareness of Divnity." When Wordsworth, later in his life, became a more committed Christian, he emphasized the Hebraic qualities of Christianity—ethical, historic, and national values—rather than dogmatic concerns and a preoccupation with personal immor tality. [FPM] 3560 McCraw, Harry W. "Walter Pater's 'Religious Phase': The Riddle of Marius the Epicurean," SoQ, 10 (1972), 245-273. Marius is intended "to convince a skeptical public that [Pater's] 'esthet ic' philosophy was not subversive of morality, and to attempt a synthesis of estheticism and super natural religion." Marius' dignity demonstrates the first; but his indecision voids the effort at synthesis. 3561 Mermin, Dorothy M. "The Two Worlds in Arnold's 'The Strayed Reveller'," SEIL, 12 (1972), 735-743. This and other poems published in 1849 explore the choice between nature and its pleasures on one hand, and obedience to the in different gods on the other. "'Resignation' . . . solves the poet's problem by merging God, man, and nature, but devitalizes them all." 3562 Pickering, Samuel F., Jr. "Dombey and Son and Dickens's Unitarian Period," GaR, 26 (1972), 438-454. "Begun immediately after Dickens completed The Life of Our Lord, the novel repeated the Socinian doctrines of the child's history of Jesus. . . . after Dombey Dickens lost his faith in Unitarian personal benevolism, and the world of his novels grew bleaker." 3563 Schuetz, Lawrence F. "Pater's Mari us : The Temple of God and the Palace of Art," ELT, 15 (1972), 1-19. Marius' search for integrated being leads him toward Christianity, where moral ity and aesthetics may be reconciled, though Marius (and Pater) cannot accept a dogmatic Christianity. II 82</page><page sequence="21">3564 Scott, James F. "George Eliot, Positivism, and the Social Vision of Middlemarch," VS, 16 (1972), 59-76. Eliot had absorbed the thought of Comte and his disciples, and the "Positivist description of social change colors the portraiture of Middlemarch, figuring particularly in the treat ment of the gentry and the Established Church." But Eliot remains faithful, finally, to a more conservative vision. 3565 Shaffer, Elinor. "Browning's St. John: The Casuistry of the Higher Criticism," VS, 16 (1972), 205-221. "The poem while vividly creating the deathbed confession of John claims only the tenuous and fragmentary documentation, the poetic suspension of disbelief accorded the Gospels by the higher criticism." 3566 Shapiro, Arnold. "Browning's Psalm of Hate: 'Caliban upon Setebos,' Psalm 50, and The Tempest," PLL, 8 (1972), 53-62. "Psalm 50 pro vides almost a complete gloss of the poem: the Old Testament God advocates the virtues Caliban lacks. He derides the superstitious fear that overwhelms creatures like Caliban. He advocates love; Caliban knows only hate. Further, 'Caliban' even imitates the structure of Psalm 50 as Browning has his speaker parody God's arguments." 3567 Shapiro, Arnold. "A New (Old) Reading of Bishop Blouqram's Apology: The Problem of the Dramatic Monologue," VP, 10 (1972), 243-256. "Through a pattern of ironic biblical references, Browning reveals a man who diverges sharply from Jesus' teaching. At the end, Browning uses the listener's actions to indicate a final rejection of the values Blougram holds." 3568 Stambler, Peter. "Selving: The Sense of Perfection in Hopkins," Thoth, 12 (1972), 21-37. "The process of selving, Hopkins' term for man's striving for the perfection of Christ, 83</page><page sequence="22">provides a poetic process through which the reader may discover a poetic image of holiness." 3569 Starzyk, Lawrence J. "Hardy's Mayor: The Antitraditional Basis of Tragedy," SNNTS, 4 (1972), 592-607. "To argue . . . that the Mayor adheres to the traditional norms of tragedy in recognizing a transcendent moral order . . . is a controversion of the heterodox character of the novel. On many significant levels--social, scientific, religious, and moral--the Mayor re bel liously testifies to the absence, rather than the presence, of an inviolable moral law govern ing the universe." 3570 Stevenson, Warren. "'Kubla Khan' as Symbol," TSLL, 14 (1972), 605-630. "The poem is about the relation between poetic composition and divine creativity. Coleridge's description of the landscape in Xanadu is Edenic" and the poet's task is to rebuild the Edenic Dome in his poem. 3571 Weisenfarth, Joseph. "Adam Bede and Myth," PLL, 8 (1972), 39-52. "in Adam Bede George Eliot uses pagan, Hebrew, and Christian myths in a tragicomic structure. The relationship of Adam, Hetty, and Arthur is given pattern and depth by a transformation of the stories of the first Adam, Prometheus, Orestes, and Jesus into a modern con text in which Love substitutes for God, work de fines man's social and moral condition, helpless suffering consequent on selfishness is his emo tional state, and fellow-feeling his redemption." 3572 Williams, Gordon. "The Problem of Passion in Wutherinq Heights," Tri vi urn, 7 (1972), 41-53. "Brontë's novel depicts a society in which passion has been crushed between decayed seven teenth-century puritanism and the new Victorian morality." 84</page><page sequence="23">3573 Wilson, James D. "Tirso, Moliere, and Byron: The Emergence of Don Juan as Romantic Hero," SCB, 32 (1972), 246-248. Tirso de Molina and Moliere treat Don Juan as a libertine either trying to combine his lust with salvation or threatening God's supremacy through his defiant egotism. Byron reverses the satire of these por traits, making Don Juan "a passive orphan trapped by a hypocritical system of moral education." TWENTIETH CENTURY 3574 Adler, Thomas P. "The Search for God in the Plays of Tennessee Williams," Renascence, XXVI (Autumn 1973), 48-56. One of Williams' char acters asks, "Is there no mercy left in the world anymore? . . . Where's God? Where's Christ?" Williams' own answer throughout his major plays is given in the form of a challenge: "We must be like God to the other, and the other must be like God to us." [DHB] 3575 Bachscheider, Paula and Nick. "Two on Couples: Updike's Couples: Squeak in the Night," MFS, 20 (Spring 1974), 45-52. "The novel's movement is Piet's search for the vote for happiness and his progression from one false God to another." In the end, Piet manages to construct a kind of faith, but it is a lonely task: "all around him [including the institutional church] is corrupted or empty." [AS] 3576 Douglas, J. D. "Stubbornly Unclassifiable," ChristT, 19 (April 11, 1975), 688-89. Essentially a review article of Roger Lancelyn Green and Walter Hooper, C. S. Lewis: A Biography, based on letters and recollections of his friends. 3577 Falke, Wayne. "Rabbit Redux: Time/Order/ God," MFS, 20 (Spring 1974T7 59-75. Critics err in finding too little and too much in John Updike's work. Updike does not demonstrate "the 85</page><page sequence="24">abundance of God's grace and the unwillingness of contemporary man to accept it," but uses "termi nology and conceptions of the universe to express man's condition in an understandable way," calling for "a humanism that has little justification in theology" and which is threatened not by "our loss of faith in God" but by "our technology." The best one can achieve in such a world is "unattrac tive compromise" between "the unlimited possibili ties for happiness" and "the unsavory actualities we face." [AS] 3578 Giannone, Richard. "The Teil hard Milieu: Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's Influence on Flannery O'Connor's Fiction," DA 34, (Feb. 1974), 5196A (Fordham U). The analogies between the works of Teilhard de Chardin and Flannery O'Connor are seen in their common beliefs: the intrinsic holiness of matter, violence as a means of revela tion, and a vision of man which is "eschatological and apocalyptic in nature." The influence on O'Connor by Teilhard is best seen in the late fiction where O'Connor's stories testify to ideas proposed by Teilhard in The Phenomenon of Man, The Divine Mi 1ieu, Building the Earth, Hymn of the Universe, and Letters from a Traveller—books Miss O'Connor had reviewed or wiïich had impressed her. A testimony to her regard for Teilhard is her saying that his "Hymn to Matter" is "the most devastating and enchanting statement of Christian asceticism" that she had ever read. [FPM] 3579 Ginger, Robert S. "Has John Updike Any thing to say?" MFS, 20 (Spring 1974), 97 105. Updike's protagonists search for "the door to eternity" and fight "the fear of non-existence" "by entering other doors through which the body is sated but the soul is abandoned." [AS] 3580 Hinz, Evelyn J. "Rider Haggard's She: An Archetypal 'History of Adventure'," SNNTS, 4 (1972), 416-431. "The journey of the hero and 86</page><page sequence="25">his guide to central Africa--'the heart of dark ness' --is presented as the paradigmatic return to the axis mundi; the major events of the narrative are designed as reenactments of the Promethean and Christian versions of the Fall." 3581 Howard, Thomas. "T.S. Eliot," ChristT, XIX (Jan 3, 1975), 332-34. Essentially a summary of Russel Kirk's T. S. Eliot and His Age. Eliot stood for the tradition in face of the liberalism of his, and our, age by asserting that transcendence was worth fighting a tragic struggle for. [JFS] 3582 Kilby, C. S., and Evans, Linda J. "C. S. Lewis and Music," ÇSR, IV (1974), 1-15. Lewis was very knowledgeable about music, and, despite the popular notion (not without warrant in Lewis's own works) that he disliked music, he found great delight in many forms of music. [TH] 3583 Lawing, John V. Jr. "Kurt Vonnegut: Charming Nihilist," ChristT, XIX (Feb. 14, 1975), 461, 64, 66. Vonnegut suggests that only the things that make people happy are worth-while. Mankind needs frauds like religion to keep alive. The only problem with religion is that it is not deceptive enough. Vonnegut is dangerous because he is so charming and clever. His mistake is that he has not seen the true value of man as demonstrated by Christ's sacrifice. [JFS] 3584 Leax, John. "Poetry and Contemplation: The Inner War of Thomas Merton," ChristT, XIX (May 23, 1975), 835-36, 838. Merton's early life and writings were troubled by the dilemma he faced in his rejection of the world. He could not follow the traditional via negativa because he was commanded by his abbot to write. The con flict was resolved after he realized that he had a dual calling, one that included writing as a part of sainthood. [JFS] 87</page><page sequence="26">3585 Low, Anthony. "The Friendly Dog: Eliot and Hardy," AN&amp;Q (March, 1974), 106-108. Eliot's reference to "dog, friend of man" echoes Thomas Hardy's poem "Ah, Are you digging on My Grave?" Hardy's poem embodies two successive ironies: first that only a dog remembers while man for gets; then that even the dog has forgotten. For getful ness is a major theme in "The Waste Land" and a dominant subject of Hardy's more sinple poem. In the modern wasteland, traditional values are gone; not even the dog can be counted on. [MS] °586 McCann, Janet. "Graham Greene: The Ambi guity of Death," ChristC, (April 30, 1975), 432-435. In Greene's novels, human love is a de structive and redeeming force which clouds all moral issues and makes the world an even more dangerous place. In Greene's world (The Man Within, Brighton Rock, The Heart of the Matter) lives and deaths are ambiguous, and it is diffi cult to tell saint from sinner. [MS] 3587 McKenzie, Alan T. "'A Craftsman's Intimate Satisfactions': The Parlor Games in Couples," MFS, 20 (Spring 1974), 53-58. The games "Impres sions" and "Wonderful" in Couples demonstrate the careful construction and precise detail of the novel. [AS] 3588 Neuleib, Janice Witherspoon. "The Empty Face of Evil," ChristT, XIX (March 28, 1975), 640-42. A study of C.S. Lewis's Til We Have Faces which presents his final solution of the problem of evil. "Evil is the face of blank, malicious selfishness." [JFS] 3589 Oakland, John. "Angus Wilson and Evil in the English Novel," Renascence, XXVI (Autumn 1973), 24-36. Wilson is not always con vincing in his discussions on the nature of evil; when judged by his own criteria as a critic, he 88</page><page sequence="27">fails to give, in his fiction, a satisfactory representation of transcendent evil. [DHB] 3590 Peters, Ted. "Chariots, UFO's, and the Mystery of God: the Science and Religion of Erich von Däniken, ChristC, SCI (May 22, 1974), 560-563. Von Däniken's Chariot of the Gods seems to blend science and religion in an exciting and respectable way. But von Däniken is a pseudo scientist and a proponent of a naturalistic view of religion which attempts to explain religious mysteries as naturalistic phenomena. [MS] 3591 Renner, Stanley. "Affirmations of Faith in Victory and Murder in the Cathedral," CSR, IV, (1974), 110-119\ "ÏÏoth Conrad and Eliot see man as a prisoner of the human condition . . . both realize that man must accept his limitations." Conrad finds affirmation possible in man's capac ity to endure, Eliot in the notion that "imper fection is somehow part of a divine design and that ultimately God will make all whole." [TH] 3592 Regan, Robert Alton. "Updike's Symbol of the Center," MFS, 20 (Spring 1974), 77-96. "What is absolutely particular about Updike, and what is at the spiritual base of his circular system, is his notion that God's chosen form of communication with man is through [Jungean] man dalia imagery." Updike is "a profoundly religious poet, whose aesthetic purpose is not to eliminate mystery, but to intensify it." [AS] 3593 Rogal, Samuel J. "Sabine Baring-Gould (1834-1924): A Checklist," Serif, 9: 2 (1972), 22-35. Known only for "Onward, Christian Soldiers," Baring-Gould was actually the author of more than 265 books and articles, here listed in complete form for the first time. 3594 W. T. S. [William T. Stafford]. "Updike Four Five Six, 'Just Like That': An Essay 89</page><page sequence="28">Review," MFS, 20 (Spring 1974), 115-120. Though "Updike the artist, not Updike the Christian, is the Updike currently in need of assessment," the current crop of book-length studies of John Updike's work is valuable. [AS] 3595 Stinson, John J., "The Manichee World of Anthony Burgess," Renascence, XXVI (Autumn 1973), 37-47. For Burgess, as for Graham Greene, the interpénétration of good and evil is a princi pal theme. The ontological drama of Burgess's world is that of man caught halfway between good and evil, between light and darkness, between the sublime and the grotesque. The vision is Maniche an, yet "thoroughly Christian." [DHB] 3596 Vickery, John B. "The Centaur: Myth, His tory, and NarrativeTr~MFS, 20 (Spring 1974), 29-43. "While Barth and Updike as Christians stress the creatureliness and finiteness of man, The Centaur reveals a secular variant of the later Barth's stress upon the sacred narrative and God's entrance into man's world through the Word." The Centaur is a "daring" and "economical explora tion of the meaning and scope of narrative and the potentialities of the story-teller as a figure at the very heart of human achievement." [AS] 3597 Waldmeir, Joseph. "It's the Going That's Important, Not the Getting There: Rabbit's Questing Non-Quest," MFS, 20 (Spring 1974), 13-27. "Rabbit's running" is aimless and "Piet Hanema's sex life" is promiscuous--and that is just the point. Updike does not intend to render solu tions: "perception and examination rather than revelation are in fact his theme; the quest func tions primarily as a structural motif." [AS] 3598 Walhout, Clarence P. "The Earth is the Lord's: Religion in Faulkner," CSR. IV, (1974), 26-35. Contrary to George C. Beddell's argument in Kierkegaard and Faulkner: Modalities 90</page><page sequence="29">of Existence (Baton Rouge, 1972), that "the reli gious categories implicit in Faulkner are con sistent with those made explicit in Kierkegaard," it is the "consciousness of the mythic and the mystical qualities of nature rather than the con sciousness of God" that furnishes the ultimate ground for religious experience as far as Faulkner is concerned. [TH] 3599 Ward, Sister M. Eucharista. "Suffering as Passivity: Pierre Teil hard de Chardin as a Gloss on Gerard Manley Hopkins," VP, 10 (1972), 321-331. Teil hard's philosophical conception of "passivities" illuminates Hopkins' account of suffering's positive values as a call to search for God, to struggle against evil, and to reassign all one's capacities to God's calling. 91</page></plain_text>
