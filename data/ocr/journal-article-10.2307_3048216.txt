<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO PAINTINGS BY CORREGGIO* LAUREN SOTH In the spring of 1794, while the Terror raged in Paris, the painter Jacques Louis David went before the National Convention of the French Republic to make an impassioned plea for the preservation of works of art in the state collections. Referring to the painting illustrated in Figure I, David cried: "Vous ne recon- naitrez plus l'Antiope. Les glacis, les demi-teintes, en un mot tout ce qui caracterise particulierement le Cor- rige et le met si fort au-dessus des plus grands peintres, tout a disparu."' David's remarks indicate that Correggio's paint- ing had become popularly known as a representation of Jupiter and Antiope. This identification, still in com- mon use today, can be traced back only as far as an in- ventory of 1709/10.2 Prior to the eighteenth century, the painting was always described in such terms as "Venere e Cupido che dorme, con un Satiro," to quote the earliest document mentioning it, a 1627 inventory of the Ducal Gallery at Mantua.' In the picture itself, we see a female nude and a Cupid asleep in a wood. To the right of the nude lies a quiver with arrows. Between the two figures lie, par- tially covered, an inverted torch and a bow on which the nude rests her left hand. A satyr, apparently having just uncovered the nude, looks on with an expression of exquisite longing. * To the best of my knowledge, A. E. Popham (Correg- gio's Drawings, London, 1957, p. 89) was the first to suggest a thematic connection between the two paintings discussed in this note. The suggestion was repeated by Cecil Gould in his National Gallery Catalogue: The Sixteenth Century Italian Schools (Excluding the Venetians), London, I962, p. 27. The proposal that the celestial and terrestrial Venuses might be involved was made by Professor Erwin Panofsky in a semi- nar at New York University, Fall 1962. I would like to thank Professors Panofsky and H. W. Janson for their helpful sug- gestions. I am also indebted to Dr. Norman Neuerberg for aid in obtaining illustrations and to Carleton College for funds to purchase photographs. i. J. L.

The question is, who is this nude? Is she Venus, as the early sources attest? Or is the more recent critical tradition correct in identifying her as Antiope? Let us examine the latter hypothesis first. In classical mythology, Antiope, the daughter of Nycteus, was se- duced by Jupiter in the form of a satyr. After her fath- er's death, she became a ward of her uncle Lycus and his wife Dirce. The twin sons she bore to Jupiter, Amphion and Zethus, were left on a mountain to die but were saved by a herdsman. Antiope was cruelly treated by Dirce and eventually fled, with Dirce in pursuit, to the hut where her sons, now grown up, were living. The youths revenged their mother by tying Dirce by the hair to the horns of a wild bull. In ancient art, it was the climax of this story, Dirce's punishment, which was usually depicted, as on a wall of the House of the Vettii, Pompeii, or in the Farnese Bull. There appears to be only one instance in antiquity in which the seduction of Antiope is shown. In a Roman mosaic in Palermo (Fig. 3), two scenes are recogniz- able as Jupiter seducing Leda in the form of a swan and Danae in the form of a golden shower. In keep- ing with the theme of the loves of Jupiter, the third scene in this row must represent the seduction of An- tiope, since it was only on that occasion that the god transformed himself into a satyr to attain his ends,' although the woman here is characterized as a bac- chante. In this representation, Antiope is definitely not sleeping, as is Correggio's nude. Nor is she described as asleep in any of the ancient literary versions of the myth.5 If Correggio's painting does portray Jupiter and Antiope, it is without precedent in either antique art or literature. The image of a satyr uncovering a sleeping nude did exist in antiquity, however, in a different context. It was used, to quote Saxl, "to represent the discovery of Ariadne by Bacchus by showing one of the ill-man- nered members of his cortege unveiling her."' Saxl has further pointed out the dependence of one of the woodcuts of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (Fig. 5) on such a classical model.' This woodcut illustrates 3.

It dates from 1499, the year the book was published in Venice, and therefore stands at the head of a long line of similar representations, including Correggio's.8 Like the Antiope, the nude in the woodcut has an ambiguous identification. She is referred to in the text as "una elegante Nympha iterscalpta" but an inscrip- tion under the fountain (contained in the text also) implies that the figure is Venus.9 As the author com- pares her to Praxiteles' statue of Venus, this implica- tion may have been intended. It is typical of Colonna's cultural snobbishness that, throughout his text, he rarely names mythological characters but expects his readers to know who they are. Of the numerous sixteenth century versions of the sleeping nude and satyr image,10 only three can be identified, with varying degrees of certainty, as Jupiter and Antiope: I. A medallion on a playing board by Hans Kels, dating from I537 and in Vienna (Fig. 7).11 The in- scription around the medallion is specific: IOVIS IN FORMA SATIRI CUM ANTIOPA CONCUBI- TUS. Antiope, nude, sits on a bed under a baldacchino while Jupiter approaches from the right. 2. An etching by the monogrammist LD, from a design by Primaticcio (Fig. 4).12 From the presence of an eagle, we may infer that the satyr here is indeed Jupiter in disguise. 3. A painted scene on a Venetian chest in the Staat- liches Museum, Schwerin (Fig. 6). Cupid watches a satyr uncover a sleeping nude lying on a bed outdoors. That these figures are Jupiter and Antiope may be in- ferred from the other scene. It obviously derives from Titian's Diana and Callisto.13 In order to seduce Cal- listo, Jupiter had assumed the form of Diana herself. Here the real Diana is showing expelling the nymph from her train. If one of the scenes on this chest can be identified as the story of a love of a transformed Jupiter, it is natural to expect its pendant to be another. (As already mentioned, it was only for his rendezvous with Antiope that the god became a satyr.) Furthermore, according to one ancient tradition, Callisto was also a daughter of Nycteus."1 If it seems natural to match one love of Jupiter with another, it would be even more natural to match incidents involving two sisters. If we compare these three works with Correggio's so-called Antiope, significant differences are notice- able. Where the authentic Antiopes rest in elaborate beds--even the anonymous artist of the Venetian chest has clumsily dragged one into his landscape-Correg- gio's lies on the bare ground. She is accompanied in sleep by Cupid. This figure does not appear in the Kels or the Primaticcio (unless it be claimed that the wingless putto is Cupid)15 and he plays more of a spec- tator's role on the chest. On this comparative basis, there are grounds for denying to Correggio's nude the name of Antiope. Is there evidence to support the earlier identification of Venus? To answer this question, we must take into account another of Correggio's paintings, the Education of Cupid in the National Gallery, London (Fig. 2). This painting is first mentioned in the same 1627 inventory as the so-called Antiope and presumably was done for the ruling family of Mantua, that is, for Federigo Gon- zaga II or his mother, Isabella d'Este. It is described in the inventory as "un quadro con sopra una Venere et un Mercurio che insegna a leggere a Cupido." In the painting, we have no trouble recognizing Mercury and Cupid; but why the winged nude holding a bow on the left should be identified as Venus is a puzzle that we shall have to return to later. The source of the Education of Cupid is again to be found in the Hypnerotomachia, not in the illustrations but in a description, in the fifth chapter, of the sculp- tural decoration of a monumental portal. (The portal is illustrated but the spaces for the decoration are blank.) As there will be occasion to refer to parts of this description again, the entire passage is quoted here with the details corresponding to Correggio's painting in italics.16 8. For a list, see A. Pigler, Barockthemen, Budapest, 1956, pp. I33-i34 ("Jupiter als Satyr bei der schlafenden Antiope") and pp. 238-239 ("Venus und Satyr"). 9. Fol. d8r.

The popularity of this image, originating in and propagated by the Hypnerotomachia, was so great that it was utilized in several different contexts: Jupiter and Antiope, Venus and Satyr, Nymph and Satyr, even for the story of Amymone. As Apollodorus told it (Library 2. i, 4) it was the satyr who was asleep, not Amymone, but in an en- graving by Girolamo Mocetto their roles have been reversed in accordance with the Hypnerotomachia woodcut. See Arthur M. Hind, Early Italian Engraving, London, 1948, v, p. 166, vii, pl. 728. Of all these representations, the most famous is Titian's painting in the Louvre. It offers a parallel to Correggio's pic- ture: the early sources refer to the sleeping nude as Venus; later critics, as Antiope. See Paul Hofer, "Die Pardo-Venus Tizians," Festschrift Hans R. Hahnloser, Basel, 1961, pp. 34iff. 11. Albert Ilg, "Das Spielbrett von Hans Kels," Jahrbuch der kunsthistorischen sammlungen des Allerhb-chsten Kaiser- hauses, III, 1885, p. 53. 12. J. D.

Schubring already identified the other scene as Jupiter and Antiope but gave no reasons for doing so. 14. Apollodorus (citing Asius) Library 3. 8, 2. 15. Nor are there bow, quiver and arrows, nor torch in the Antiope scenes on Kels' playing board and the Venetian chest. In the Primaticcio, however, a small bow and a baton- like object (quiver?) lie near the putto. This would seem to indicate that he is Cupid after all, although the absence of wings is difficult to explain. There are also flames near by, but their source is not visible. 16. Fol. c4rff.

"He sat vpon a stone with an aprone of a Goates skinne, the hinder parts compassing his waste, and tyed behynde with a knotte, and the neck part, with the hayrie side next him, hung downe betwixt his legges. Before him in the interstice of these grose and tumorus calfes, there was an anuill fastned vpon a knottie peece of a tree, wherevpon he was fashoning of a bryganine or habergion of burning metall, houlding vp his Hammer, and as it were striking vpon his worke. "And there before him was a most noble woman, hauing two fethered wings set vpon hir delicate and tender shoulders, houlding hir sonne an infante naked, which sate with his little hyppes vpon the large and goodly proportioned thighes of the faire goddesse his mother, and playing with hir, as she held him vp, and putting his feete vpon a stone, as it had beene a little hill, with a fornace in a hollow hole, wherin was an extreame whote burning fire.

"There was also fast by, of like excellent woorkemanship, a knight of fierce countenance, hauing vpon hym an armour of brasse, with the head of Medusa vpon the curate or brest plate, and all the rest exquisitely wrought and beautified, with a bandilier ouerthwart his broad and strong brest, houlding with hys brawny arme a halfe Pike, and raysing vp the poynte thereof, and bearing vpon his head a high crested helmet, the other arme shadowed and not seene by reason of the former figure: There was also a young man in silke clothing, behynde the Smith, whome I could not perceiue but from the brest vpwarde, ouer the declyning head of the forenamed Smith.

The only sig- nificant difference is that in the Hypnerotomachia Cupid receives three arrows from his tutor (unnamed but obviously Mercury) instead of a reading lesson. The unusual subject of Cupid's education seems to have been popular at the court of Mantua, for a 1542 inventory of Isabella d'Este's collection lists a bronze of Mercury teaching Cupid to read. Hermann has suggested that a statuette by Antico in Vienna is the one referred to (Fig. Io), although there is no Cupid present today."8 However, Mercury's off-center posi- tion and two holes in the portion of the base opposite him indicate that there once was another figure, and the god's pedagogic pose bears out Hermann's conten- tion.19 What is the significance of the unique role Mercury plays as teacher and educator in these works? To an- swer this question, we must take into consideration the mediaeval astrological tradition which still remained viable in the Renaissance and which lies behind numer- ous visual monuments as late as the Cinquecento, e.g., the ceiling of the Sala della Galatea in the Villa Far- nesina, Rome.20 The belief that men and their faculties were under the influence of the planets was adhered to even by the great Neoplatonic philosopher, Marsilio Ficino. In a letter he declares that "in us, the Moon signifies the continuous movement of mind and body; Mars, speed; Saturn, slowness; Mercury, reason; and Venus, humanity."21 In the Trecento, these beliefs had led in the visual arts to series of representations in which the planetary deities were anthropomorphically presented as manifes- tations of the faculties over which they held sway. Thus we find Mercury, the planet having dominance over man's rational powers, in the guise of scholar and teacher on the campanile of Florence (Fig. 9), a capi- tal of the Doge's Palace in Venice (Fig. 8), and in Guariento's frescoes in the Eremitani, Padua (Fig. I i), just as we find him in Correggio's picture. It is known that the Hypnerotomachia relies on mediaeval astrology,22 but the assertion that the same tradition lies behind Correggio's naturalistic painting must seem surprising indeed. Yet in addition to ac- counting for Mercury's role as teacher it also provides the most plausible explanation for the odd feature of the winged nude traditionally identified as Venus in Correggio's picture and described as a goddess in the Hypnerotomachia. A similar winged nude appears in a fifteenth century drawing of the school of Padua (Fig. I3). The various attributes shown here-Cupid, torch, doves, bull- definitely identify the figure as Venus. The goddess balances on a globe, and behind her is a large star, like a Christmas tree ornament. This same star figuration appears behind Venus (Fig. I2) and other figures in Guariento's planet cycle and obviously serves to identify them as the planetary gods and goddesses. Its function must be the same in the Paduan drawing: the Venus portrayed therein is the planetary Venus and the bull represents her ac- companying sign of the zodiac, Taurus. At some time in northern Italy, between the Guari- ento frescoes and the Paduan drawing, wings were added as an attribute of the planetary Venus. This at- tribute was retained by Correggio in his own represen- tation of the figure.28 To sum up, the Mercury and Venus of Correg- gio's painting, while depicted in the most stunning x7. Pozzi (op.cit., II, p. 74) has pointed out that Carpaccio used the description of the right-hand scene for an architectural relief in the background of his Return of the Ambassadors to the King of England in the Academy, Venice. See Jan Lauts, Carpaccio, London, 1962, pls. 36, 39. Lauts (op.cit., p. 230) and before him Wilhelm Bode (Florentine Sculptors of the Renaissance, London, 1908, p. x82 n. x) believed a bronze relief by Bertoldo to be Carpaccio's source. There are a number of reliefs from the circle of Bertoldo which are unmistakenly related to the Hypnerotomachia in some way (Wilhelm Bode, Bertoldo und Lorenzo dei Medici, Freiburg-im-Breisgau, 1925, illustrations on pp. 42, 44, 46, 47, 79, 8S). I hope to explore this problem in the future. S8.

With this in mind, let us turn back to the so-called Antiope (Fig. I). When it is viewed together with the Education of Cupid (Fig. 2), a stylistic and the- matic relationship becomes apparent. In both pictures, three figures are placed in a densely foliaged wood which serves as a dark backdrop for their glistening bodies. In the London painting, the planetary Venus is seen engaged in an act of noble uplift, providing for the education of her son. In the Paris picture, a female nude, identified as Venus by the earliest sources and also accompanied by Cupid, is shown in a rather more earthy and sug- gestive situation. I think we can now recognize these two figures. They are none other than the celestial Venus and the terrestrial or natural Venus, those Neoplatonic sym- bols of the two kinds of beauty which, in turn, inspire two kinds of love: the one celestial, metaphysical, and rational, that is, comprehended by the mind; the other, earthly and sensual. Seldom have the twin Venuses been represented as graphically as they have been by Correggio. His celestial Venus, associated with the realm of the mind, is por- trayed as helping Cupid to cultivate his own intellect. She calls the viewer's attention to this with her arrest- ing stare and the gesture of her right arm, in a pose derived from Leonardo's Leda. Her counterpart is stretched out upon the earth with which she is associated. Gazing upon her seductive form is a satyr, a figure consistently used in the Renais- sance to represent irrational lasciviousness. There can be no doubt that the emotion celebrated in this pic- ture is of a decidedly sensual nature, in contrast to the more sublime form of love exemplified in the Educa- tion of Cupid.24 Support for this hypothesis may be adduced from the long description of the portal sculpture in the Hypnero- tomachia, quoted above. The Venus, Mercury, and Cupid in the left-hand relief correspond almost exactly to Correggio's figures in the Education of Cupid, as already mentioned. Venus and Cupid appear also in the right-hand relief accompanied by Vulcan ("uno homo di aetate appresso la uirilitate excedente," etc., de- scribed as working at an anvil) and Mars ("uno armi- gero di sembiante fremebondo"). With the aid of the genealogy drawn up by Cicero,25 we can determine the relationships of the figures in these two scenes. Cicero's second Venus (in his list of four) is the celestial Venus who was born of the sea. She and Mercury are the parents of the second Cupid. His third Venus is the terrestrial Venus, the daughter of Jupiter and Dione. Although married to Vulcan, she was the mother by Mars of another Cupid (the third and last in Cicero's list). The Hypnerotomachia portal reliefs depict the stories of the twin Venuses and their respective families.26 Let us review the connections between the Hypnero- tomachia and Correggio's two paintings. The artist has taken his celestial Venus and her family straight out of the text. His only change has been to show Mercury giving his son not arrows but a reading lesson, thereby enhancing the intellectual nature of the group. For his terrestrial Venus, Correggio ignored the text description of the corresponding portal relief and chose instead an illustration from another chapter of the book (Fig. 5). He may well have understood the ambiguous sleeping nude to be a Venus, as another artist, Giorgi- one, had done earlier. The latter's Sleeping Venus in Dresden derives directly from this woodcut.27 In summary, there is in support of a Neoplatonic interpretation of Correggio's paintings the external evidence of the early sources, the internal evidence of the paintings themselves, and the analogous evidence of the Hypnerotomachia. There is also the fact that both pictures are first mentioned in 1627 in the same collection, that of the Gonzagas. It is certainly conceiv- able that they entered this collection as pendants a cen- tury earlier. One apparent objection to this interpretation is the fact that the paintings are not the same size, the Edu- cation of Cupid being both shorter and narrower.28 However, old copies show that this picture has been cut down, seemingly on all four sides.29 An engraving made in 1815 of a copy then in the Massias collection, Paris (Fig. I4), gives some idea of the original di- mensions of Correggio's work. The Venus in the copy has a quiver with arrows behind her feet to go along with the bow she holds. This does not appear in the original, although the god- dess is described as holding an empty quiver and bow in the Hypnerotomachia. According to the National Gallery catalogue, the corresponding area in the Correggio has definitely been overpainted.30 It seems likely that Correggio's celestial Venus once had quiver and arrows to go along with her still-visible bow. This establishes another link with her supposed pendant where these items are prominent Even the torch between the terrestrial Venus and Cupid fits into this interpretation. In the Middle Ages, the image of Cupid asleep on his torch had been used to symbolize amor carnalis.31 Correggio incorporated 24.

Like their primary source, the Hypnerotomachia, Correggio's two paintings represent a fusion of a me- diaeval astrological tradition with Renaissance Neo- platonism. Because of this abstruse combination, it is hardly surprising that in the course of time the true identity of the twin Venuses should have vanished along with "les glacis et les demi-teintes" mourned by David.
