<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANTIQUITY OF MAGAS IN ANCIENT INDIA V. C. Srivastava ( Allahabad ) The question of the antiquity of Magas in ancient India is a very significant question in the socio-religious history of India as their advent and presence in India marks the beginnings of new traditions in solar cult1 as well as growth of social mobility and flexibility2. Such an important aspect of socio-religious history has been dealt with in a very simplified, generalised and routine man-</page><page sequence="2">ANCIENT INDIA 87 ner by making us believe that Magas came in the wake of Śakas3 and there- fore Śaka-Kusana period may be definited as the time for arrival of Magas in India.4 This fashionable view was supported by the facts that Magas came from "Śakadvipa",5 that the earliest evidence for "Mithra-worship" is to be found on coins of Kaniska6, that there is no sun icon of Persian tradition of a date earlier than Kusāņa period7, and that there is no literary reference to them before the 2nd century A.D.8 Apparently the matter seems to be settled, but a deeper dig at the root of the problem will leave no room for doubt that the problem needs better treatment than it has been given hitherto. Some of the fundamental assmuptions of this question may be challenged. Firstly, that Magas came in the wake of Śakas on the basis of Purāņic reference of 'Śaka- dvipa' as their home9 may be challenged on the ground that there is no indi- cation of any generic relationship between Magas and Śakas in any of known literatures. There is not the slightest hint in Purāņas of any connection bet- ween Śakas and Magas as a community except that they both were foreigners and the latter came from a place referred to in Purāņas as "Śakadvipa"10. It is simply surprising as to how from above reference the inference may be drawn that Magas came in the trains of Śakas. Secondly, the coins of Kaniska with Mithra figures and Miuro inscrip- tion may be simply regarded as indication of official recognition and royal patronage of this cult11 rather than of antiquity of Magas in India. Thirdly, the absence of sun-icons of Persian tradition before the Kusāņa period may only indicate that the Persian tradition of solar iconography could become a popular and established custom in the Kusāņa period12 but that does not show that its introducers also came at that very time. A foreign custom always takes time to gain popoularity particularly in an orthodox country of rich traditions like India. In case of Magas whose custom varied with Indians in many fundamental points and who indulged into many ob- jectionable practices13 according to norms of Indian Culture it is quite natural that they may have been accepted in society quite late after their first appearance on Indian soil.14 Moreover, Indians had their own tradition of solar-cult and iconography15 and therefore adoption of foreign traditions of solar cult must have been after sufficient thinking and timelag. It is also very significant to note that ancient Iranians themselves did not represent the Sun-God in human form in the earliest times and used to represent him by means of symbols. In one of the Sepulchres of Darius near Naqshi Rustam Mithra is represented as a round disc. The fully anthropomorphic representation of Mithra was due to Hellenic influence as is evident by monuments of 1st century B.C. Next stage was that of human busts of Sun in later Mithraism.16 Such human bust of Sun is seen on Bharhut medallion.17 This explains the absence of sun- icons of Persian traditions before 1st century B.C,</page><page sequence="3">88 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS 1968 Fourthly, the absence of literary reference to Magas before Gupta period may be explained on same grounds as in case of sun-icons of Persian tradition as well as on the ground that Brahmanic literature mentions them only after they were absorbed as 'Brāhmaņas' in society18. It is quite correct to say that a religious fact or institution might exist much earlier than it finds expression in literature.19 Thus it is clear that arguments put forward in favour of Śaka- Kusāņa period as the time for arrival of Magas in India are inconclusive for the date of Magas, though these may show that by this time Magian tradition of sun-worship was an established practice.20 It is suggested that there is every probability that Magas entered into India in the wake of Achaemenid invasion21 for the first time, though they may have continued pouring in trains of other invasions. Firstly, it may be pointed out that Magas appear to have played significant part in Achaemenid empire - a fact which may be best illustrated by the fact that a Maga was the leader of revolt against the accession of Darius22. Moreover, Mithra cult whose priests Magas were, was extremely popular among the military forces of Iran23. Fur- ther the close geographical proximity of Iran and India coupled with close commercial and cultural contacts between Iran and India from very early time24 make it more than probable that Magas may have entered into India in the wake of Achaemenid invasion of north-western India. It is also significant to note that there were quite considerable number of foreigners in the Indian population of north-western India25 so much so that a foreigner named Tusāspa was appointed governor of Saurāstra by Aśoka29. It was in this very region that Mágas started their activities according to the Purāņas27. All these circumstantial evidences strengthen the probability of Maga-advent in the wake of Achaemenid invasion. The testimony of Arśeya upanisad is quite revealing in this respect. According to this upanisad28 Bhāradvāja who believed in sun as the ultimate reality actually shared views with such tribes as Dardas, Suhmas, Puņdras and Barbaras who also believed in sun-worship. It appears as if some of these tribes were foreigners because Barbaras may be a general expression for foreigners29, Puņdras have been regarded as low-caste30 and Dardas may be identified with Dardas of lower Indus valley of Achaemenid times referred to by Herodotus31. It is also to be borne in mind that Arśeya upanisad has been grouped with older upanisads as Chandogya32. Therefore inference may be drawn that a few tribes which were sun-worshippers of sectarian type may have lived in the Indian province of Achaemenid empire. The Achae- menid rulers were responsible for introduction of Iranian religion in place of Daiva worship as is clear from the statement of Xerxes in Persepolis Inscrip- tion. This phenomenon must have helped the advent of Magas in India, in it was not a product of Maga advent itself in India in Achaemenid period.</page><page sequence="4">ANCIENT INDIA 89 The indirect testimony of Bambhajāla sutta which cannot be dated later than the 4th33 century B.C. is also relevant to this question. According to this work magic priests were held in disrepute in the time of Buddha34. It is well known that Magas were famous for their magic and occult power35. More- over they were in disrepute in India on account of their objectionable practi- ces36, and the disrepute continued even after their absorption in Indian society as is evident from such terms as "Apanktïya"37. Are we not to suppose that the reference may be towards "Maga Brahmańas" ? The testimony of Greek writers is also revealing. Philostratos refers to a temple of the sun at Taxila and according to Plutarch there was another on the Hydaspes on which the elephants of Porus ascended at the advance of Alexander38. This shows that sun temples existed in India before Alexander and there had been provision for public-worship of the sun. It is agreed that the tradition of public-worship through images and temples was introduced by the Magas in India39. In view of this it may be said that sun-temples refer- red to by the Greek writers are expressive of presence of Magas in India before Alexander. It is suggested that Magas were responsible for introduction of the custom of marriage between the closest kin in ancient Persia40. This type of custom or cousin marriage is found in South India from very early times. The earliest reference to this custom is in Baudhayana Dharma sūtra41 which may be dated between 600 B.C. - 300 B.C.42. The origin of this custom is not definitely known. It has been suggested that it may have been of foreign origin.43 If it is correct, it may have been introduced by Magas in India showing thereby the advent of Magas in the 6th-5th century B.C. Even if it is accepted that Magas came in the train of Śakas there are indi- cations to show that Achaemenid period may have been the probable period for the first wave of Magian advent in India. It is suggested that there may have been 'Śaka infiltrations in India before Alexander44. Moreover, there is reference to a group of Śacae establishing themselves in Driangiana in Achae- menian period45 from inscriptions of Darius I it is clear that Śakas existed in Darius empire46. In view of all this it is quite probable that Magas entered into India in the wake of Śaka infiltrations in Achaemenid period. There are archaeoloigcal evidences recently brought to light to the effect that as early as the 6th-5th centuries B.C. there may have been contacts between India and Central Asia and therefore with Śakas also47. It was long ago suggested48 that the tradition of fire altar and sun disc discovered at Basarh of Gupta period is not due to any modification of Sas- sanian coinage through Kusāna influence but rather due to survival in India itself, of the older, more original Persian tradition on such matters which antedates Sassanian themselves by many centuries. This appears to be a correct 12</page><page sequence="5">90 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS 1968 appreciation of the situation as the same device is found on indigenous coins of Pānchāla Bhānumitra and these are earlier than the Kusāņas.49 Moreover Mithraic element may be seen on a Vatasvaka coin where there is a figure to left with raised hand in front of a mountain, below the mountain is a pile of balls and below the figure is a taurine symbol.50 There is something Mithraic about the attitude of the figure apparently worshipping Sun in front of a mountain. The evidence of an Avanti coin with "Sürya dhvaja"51 (300 B.C. - 2nd cen. A.D.) is also significant as this region was under the influence of Magian form of sun-worship as Varahmihira - a Magian Sun-worshipper hailed from Avanti52 and this Avanti Coin with sectarian sun-worship may have been influenced by Magian tradition of sun-worship. The above evidence of coins and seals indicate that Mithraic element may have been introduced in India much earlier than the Kusāna period as early as the 3rd century B.C. In the light of this, probability is that the Magas came in the wake of Achaemenian invasion of 5th-4th century B.C. It has been suggested that Pushyamitra may have been an Iranian, a wor- shipper of the Sun-Mithra53. It has been argued that in absence of any sur- vival of old Persian tradition it is difficult to explain how Pushyamitra could have been influenced by the Persian example in adopting the name of Mitra.54 Though it is difficult to reach any conclusion whether Pushyamitra was an Iranian, it is not without significance to find that most of the members of the family adopt 'Mitra* and one atleast - Agnimitra55 adopts a name indicative of fire and sun - a fact which is definitely Magian.56 Moreover Pushymitra has been associated with Bhāradvāja.57 It is well known that Bharadvajas were sun-worshippers from Rigvedic times.58 There is probability that this dynasty may have been a sun-worshipper of Magian type.59 If a ruling dynasty before Śaka-Kusana period was influenced by the Maigan form of sun-worship it is natural to surmise that Magas may have come in the wake of Achaemenian invasion. In view of the fact the Achaemenian occupation of India touched only the fringes of India60 it is quite reasonable to suppose that Magas could not become popular immediately after their advent. They would become popular and gain strength only when northern India passed into the hands of foreign rulers like Greeks, Śakas and Kusānas who patronised this cult. The above review may lead us to believe that the Magas may have entered into India for the first time as early as the 6th-5th century B. C. in the wake of Achaemenian invasion. The silence of the early Purāņas and other Brahmanic literaure before 4th-5th century A.D. about Magas may not be interpreted as negating the advent of the Magas. This may be due to the hostility of the orthodox Brahmanas towards these foreign priests. They found place in Brahmanic literature only when they were accepted in the Hindu fold because of their extreme popularity by the middle of the 6th century A.D.</page><page sequence="6">ANCIENT INDIA 91 .

Farnell, E.R.E., Vol. VI, p. 294, has rightly suggested "nor can we safely date a religious fact by the date of the author who first mentioned it". The remarks of Shri R.P. Chanda "The Indo- Aryan reces p. 88 about the cult of Gopala holds good for antiquity of Magas also - "As regards the antiquity of the cult of Gopala it may be observed that Indians are ex- tremely conservative in religious matters and refuse to adopt any cult unless it can be recognized as Sanātana or coming from times immemorial. Consequently absence of archaeological or literary evidence can not be construed as a conducive proof of the non-existence of the cult before the - time of Bhāsa or Harivamsa". 20.
