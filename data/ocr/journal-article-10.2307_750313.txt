<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PAGAN ORIGINS OF THE THREE-HEADED REPRESENTATION OF THE CHRISTIAN TRINITY By R. Pettazzoni A god with three faces, or three heads, held an important position in the religion of the Celts of Gaul, as we know from the tricephalous figures represented on many Gallo-Roman monuments (first to third century A.D.)1 which are found all over Gaul from Belgium to Aquitaine and bear witness to the wide diffusion of the cult of this god (P1. I3). In Germanic paganism no representation of a tricephalous god is known, though on one of the two golden horns, now lost, from Gallehus (Tondern) in South Jutland, dating from the fifth century A.D., there are various decora- tions which include a standing figure with three heads (P1. I4b) seen in front view, and formerly interpreted by German scholars as Thor, or some other Germanic god.2 These horns are, however, now thought to be of southern origin, either from some manufacturing centre in the Danubio- Balkan region,3 or direct from Scythia.4 A tricephalous god is found in the ancient Balkan world, for the so-called "Thracian Rider," reproduced in stereotyped form on hundreds of steles of the second and third centuries A.D. which have come to light, particularly in Bulgaria,5 is sometimes represented with three heads (P1. 14c).6 The only monument of Slav origin which need be taken into consideration is the quadrangular pilaster found in 1848 in the bed of the river ZbruE near Hlusjatyn (on the frontier between Galicia and Podolia) and taken from there to Cracow.7 It is carved in relief on all four sides, the carvings being arranged in different bands. The topmost band shows a human figure on each side, whilst the lowest band distributes over three sides a squatting figure (P1. I4d). The genuineness of this monument has been doubted, to my mind without sufficient justification; but in any case neither the four 1 Esperandieu, Bas-reliefs de la Gaule romaine, Nos. 1055, 1316, 2083, 2131, 2668, 3137, 3651 ff.

PETTAZZONI terminal heads nor the three-sided figure at the base need be considered as representations of a quadricephalous and of a tricephalous god. The existence of an idol with three heads in the pagan religion of the Baltic Slavs is, however, attested by mediaeval literary sources; it was the simulacrum of the god Triglav, which means "three-headed" and, according to the biographers of Otto of Bamberg,' it was worshipped chiefly at Stettin. In addition to this Pomeranian tricephalous figure, there were various polycephalous gods amongst the pagan Slavs of the island of Riigen of which Saxo Grammaticus speaks ;2 namely the wooden idols of Svantevit, at Arkona, with four heads; of Rugievit, at Karentia (Garz), with seven heads; of Porevit, at Karentia, with five heads; and of Porenut, also at Karentia, with four heads and a fifth on the breast.3 Since the various divinities represented in tricephalous form amongst the peoples of barbarian Europe are probably, at bottom, one and the same god, we seem to catch here a glimpse of a certain religious unity in this ancient European world, consisting in a common veneration for this god, of which the tricephalous form must have been an essential characteristic. This opens up wide perspectives for the history of religion to investigate, as to the nature of this god, its origins and derivation, and the reasons for its presence among the European peoples. And the existence of representations of a tricephalous god from one end to the other of barbarian Europe is of importance also in relation to the genesis of the three-headed image of the Christian Trinity. The existence of a polycephalous divinity in Slav paganism is of great importance for both these problems. Since a negative theory on this point has been put forward, it will be necessary first of all to examine the arguments supporting it. In a book on Slav religion,4 E. Wienecke has subjected the whole literary tradition relative to the paganism of the Baltic Slavs to a radical criticism. This criticism is based on the undeniable fact that all mediaeval culture, particularly monastic culture, was dominated by the study of the Vulgate: owing to their familiarity with the text of the Bible, the monks could only express themselves, particularly in religious matters, in the language of the Old Testament. This critical principle which others had already applied to the paleoslavic sources for the paganism of the eastern Slavs, particularly to Nestor's Chronicle,5 is applied more rigorously and systematically by Wienecke to the Latin sources for the paganism of the Baltic Slavs. He denies that representations of the gods were to be found amongst them at all (or, for that matter, amongst the Russians), and he explains the numerous positive testimonies to their existence in the mediaeval 1 Vita Ottonis by the Monachus Priflin- gensis; Vita Ottonis by Ebbo; Dialogus de Vita Ottonis by Herbord. The passages are col- lected by K. H. Meyer in Fontes historiae religionis slavicae, Berlin, I931. 2 Saxo Grammaticus, Gesta Danorum, lib.

Thus, according to Wienecke, everything that has hitherto been written on Baltic-Slav paganism is invalidated through lack of this preventive criticism; the testimonies of the monks have been understood in a literal sense, without raising the preliminary problem of their literary derivation and therefore, by implication, of their validity. But though the principle of interpretatio ecclesiastica may be used to demolish the tradition relating to idols in general, it can hardly apply to the polycephalous images of the Baltic Slavs, for the description of these by the biographers of Otto and in Saxo cannot possibly be an echo of the language of Scripture which nowhere mentions polycephalous idols. In this case, therefore, Wienecke argues differently, as follows: the earliest evidence as to the existence ofpolycephalous idols amongst the Baltic Slavs is given by the biographers of Otto of Bamberg, the "Apostle of Pomerania," in connection with the god Triglav whose cult was centred at Stettin. The city of Stettin had grown up around three hills,2 and in this sense it was "triglav," that is to say, "three-pointed" (as Riedegost, the holy city of the Redarii, was called by Thietmar tricornis, not because it was triangular in plan, but because of its three gates which stood out like towers).3 The name "triglav," given to a city with three hills, would have been understood by people who spoke a different language to be the name of' the god worshipped in this city, and thus Stettin, urbs triglav, the city of the three hills, would have come to mean Stettin, urbs Triglavi, the city of the god with three heads. Since this interpretation cannot apply to the idols of Riigen, said to have had more than three heads, Wienecke explains these away in the following manner. He says that once the legend of a three-headed Slav god had established itself in one monastery after another, the three heads of Triglav would have suggested the four of Svantevit (and of Porevit), the five of Porenut, and the seven of Rugievit by a process of progressive amplification which was purely literary, the object being to emphasize the monstrosity of these gods. The paganism of the Slavs being thus presented in the most odious light, the enterprise undertaken by the Danes of finally eradicating it by the destruction of its last stronghold became all the more meritorious. The rigorous criticism of sources as a necessary preliminary to all research into Slav paganism is legitimate as to method and may be fruitful in results. I think, however, that Wienecke goes too far, and falls into a sterile hyper- criticism. The criticism of texts is necessary to historical research, but not enough in itself. It does not follow from the formal dependence of one text on another, that its content is without value. There is a fact which seems to bear out Wienecke's negative thesis,4 namely that the existence of these idols is not mentioned in earlier sources. Thietmar of Merseburg (d. Io26), who in his Chronicon tells of the cult of the 1 Op. cit., pp. 23 f. 2 Ebbo, Vita Ottonis, III, I. 3 Cf. C.

PETTAZZONI god Zuarasici amongst the Leutici Redarii (this god is also mentioned, as "Zuarasiz diabolus," in a letter of Bruno of Querfurt to the Emperor Henry II in the year Ioo8), speaks, indeed, of a simulacrum of the god,2 but does not tell us that it had more than one head. Neither does Adam of Bremen when speaking of the same god (called by him Redigast) in his Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum,3 written about 1075. The first god to whom a polycephalous image is attributed is, as already said, the Triglav of Stettin, of whom the three biographers of Otto of Bamberg speak in the twelfth century. Saxo Grammaticus, who tells of the polycephalous gods of Riigen, wrote towards the end of the twelfth century; whilst the Knytlinga Saga, written in old Norse about the middle of the thirteenth century, mentions these gods but without speaking of their polycephalous form. It may be here asked, how could Thietmar and Adam have known what the idol of the god of the Redarii was like? Their German and Christian informants could hardly have seen them with their own eyes. The Slavs themselves, according to the sources, were not usually admitted into the presence of the simulacra of the gods, this being the privilege of the priests,4 and those worshippers who might have caught a glimpse of them would hardly have been disposed to furnish Christians with an exact description. There was, however, one occasion on which the idols of the Baltic-Slav paganism could certainly have been seen by Christians, and this was at the moment of their destruction. But this unique opportunity for an autopsy would not have been available in the eleventh century when Slavism was still flourishing and Baltic-Slav paganism was strongly resisting the attacks of Christianity. It was not until the twelfth century that the situation changed, and with the advance of Germanism came at the same time the victory of Christianity and the destruction of Slav paganism. Then the idols of the heathen divinities were destroyed, and the images of Triglav were certainly seen by Otto's companions who were present at their destruction, in which they may themselves have taken part. They were therefore in a position to describe them, on their return home, to the monk of Priifening or to the other biographers of the Bishop of Bamberg. In the same way the idols of Svantevit, and of the other gods of Riigen, may have been seen, if not by Saxo himself, by the Danish soldiers of King Valdemar and of Archbishop Absalom, who were present at the capitulation of Arkona and of Karentia in i I68 and 1169, and later became the informants of Saxo. Thus the fact that it is the later writers who tell us of the polycephalous character of these images, of which the earlier authorities do not speak, is not a sign of the unreliability of their evidence, but may be taken as in some sense a positive indication of their veracity, since the only people who describe these images 1 The texts are printed in the above-men- tioned collection by Meyer (C. Clemen, Fontes historiae religionum, fasc. IV). 2 V1, 23. 3 II, 21. 4 Saxo, XIV, p. 564, ed. Holder: "...sacel- lum (of Svantevit) quod ei (to the priest) soli ntrandi fas erat"; cf. Helmold, I, p. 84: "ingressus atrii (of the sanctuary of Prove) omnibus inhibitus nisi sacerdoti tantum et sacrificare volentibus; (but of this Prove) nullae sunt effigies expressae." The simula- crum of Triglav at Stettin was covered with a veil, "aurea cidari oculos et labia contege- bat" (Ebbo, III, I ff.).</page><page sequence="7">THREE-HEADED REPRESENTATION OF THE CHRISTIAN TRINITY i39 are the only ones who may have had a chance of basing their description on the autopsy. Those who prefer to solve all these problems through the interpretatio ecclesiastica will be inclined to see in the description of the destruction of the idols of Stettin and Riigen nothing more than a reflection of the downfall of the golden calf. But the destruction of pagan images was a practice securely rooted in ancient Christian tradition. And the name of at least one of the gods, Zuarasic, was certainly not an invention of Bruno and Thietmar, for a god of the same name, Svarozic, figures, together with Svarog, in Russian paganism, as we know from the old Homilies (Slovo) which are attributed to the "Christolubiec", to Gregory the Theologian and to John Chrysostom.1 Moreover, the precise and exact character of the description given by the mediaeval writers of the structure of these idols is in itself an argument in favour of their real existence. Wienecke maintains that "the biographers of Otto speak of a tricephalous idol of the god 'Triglav,' but limit themselves to this bare statement, without giving further details as to the form of the idol."2 This is not exact. Herbord, when stating that Triglav had three heads and one body ("erat autem ibi simulacrum triceps, quod in uno corpore tria capita habens Triglaus vocabatur"), adds the further detail that the three heads were joined to one another ("capitella sibi cohaerentia").3 We have here, though briefly indicated, an iconographical particular of the greatest interest. Similarly, Saxo, in his description of the image of Rugievit at Karentia, says that its seven faces converged towards the top and terminated in a single apex ("septem humanae similitudinis facies . . . quae omnes unius verticis superficie claudebantur").4 And Saxo's description of the image of Svantevit at Arkona is even more particularized; he not only says that it had four heads, but tells us also that each of these heads had a neck, and that, when seen from the front, two of the heads looked forwards and two back- wards; whilst when seen from the sides, two of the heads looked to the right and two to the left.5 Whether polycephalous or not, the divine images were kept in the temples. All the authorities speak of this, both the earlier and the later ones. Some (Ebbo, Herbord) tell us that they were called continae, from the Latin continere. This really refers to the Slav word contina, which means "dwelling place," and is used of the temple as the house or habitation of the god, who is represented in his image. Temple and image are, in fact, correlated and complementary terms. We know this already from Herodotus, who, when speaking of the ancient religion of the Persians,6 says that they had neither images (&amp;y&amp;XgLs) nor temples (vioqS xat po)roos), because their conception of divinity was not anthropomorphic, like that of the Greeks. The Germans in the time of Tacitus were also without temples and images ("nec cohibere parietibus deos neque in ullam humani oris speciem adsimulare ... arbitrantur"),7 but they felt the presence of the divine in nature, particularly in woods and forests 1 Cf.

PETTAZZONI ("lucos ac nemora consecrant, deorumque nominibus adpellant secretum illud quod sola reverentia vident").1 Is it not therefore curious to find such an advanced form of worship existing amongst the Baltic Slavs, that is to say, the cultural complex of the temple and the image? And is not this a reason for doubting the reliability of the evidence given by our authors? But the authors do not only speak of temples, and we need not believe that all the places sacred to the pagan cult of the western Slavs were temples in the true sense of the word. They also had simple sanctuaries open to the sky without any building at all, where the divine was present in nature herself, whether in wood, or tree, or fountain, or in that association between tree and fountain which is attested at Stettin by the biographers of Otto.2 The latter seems to have been a cultural complex particularly characteristic of Slav paganism, for we find it still flourishing amongst the Slavs of the upper valley of the Isonzo (Caporetto) in the fourteenth century; in I331 a kind of crusade was organized in order to extirpate it.3 The distinction between these two types of cult, that in sacred groves and other places in the open air, and that in the temples, with their images of the gods, is brought out quite clearly in a passage in Helmold, where the cult of the god Prove (Olden- burg) is cited as representing the first type, whilst that of the god Podaga (Pl6n) belongs to the second type: "Est autem Slavis multiplex ydolatriae modus, non enim omnes in eandem supersticionis consuetudinem consentiunt. Hii enim simulachrorum ymaginarias formas pretendunt de templis, veluti Plunense ydolum, cui nomen Podaga, alii silvas vel lucos inhabitant, ut est Prove deus Aldenburg, quibus nullae sunt effigies expressae. Multos etiam duobus vel tribus vel eo amplius capitibus exculpunt."4 The open air cult fits in well with the notion of Slav paganism as a simple, naturalistic religion, as there is good reason to believe that it was; but this does not exclude the possibility that the western Slavs may indeed, at one time, have had temples and images, as the sources relate. Even the Persians began, at a certain moment, to represent their divinities iconographically, in imitation of Egyptian (Ahuramazda) or Babylonian (Anahita) models.5 And Tacitus himself records at least one German temple, that of the goddess Tamfana amongst the Marsi ("templum quod Tamfanae vocabant"),6 which, at any rate, must have represented the introduction of new forms of building, probably of (Gallo-)Roman origin. It is likely that the pagan temples of the Baltic Slavs might also be explained as the result of penetration by foreign cultural influences. From Tacitus to Thietmar is about a thousand years, during which the Germanic world had undergone a radical religious trans- formation through its conversion to Christianity. And for the Slav world, too, these thousand years did not pass in vain; for they brought about a 1 Ibid., loc. cit. 2 "Arborem nuceam praegrandem idolo consecratam cum fonte qui subterfluebat," Ebbo, III, I8; cf.

More- over, even in the Nordic part of the German world, which remained pagan, the cultural complex of the god and the temple is to be found; the great pagan temple at Uppsala, described by Adam of Bremen,' adorned with gold and containing the images of Thor, Wodan (Odin) and Fricka (Freyr), provides a significant parallel to the Slav temples of Rethra (Riedegost), of Stettin and of Arkona, containing the images of Zuarasik, of Triglav, and of Svantevit. The pagan temples of the Baltic Slavs are described, like their images, with a particularity and a precision which it is difficult to regard as pure invention. Take, for example, the description in Saxo Grammaticus2 of the temple of Svantevit at Arkona: a fanum, quadrangular in plan, with wooden walls, the whole standing within an enclosure, and having a kind of taber- nacle within formed by four pilasters with curtains hanging between them; this was the holy of holies, containing the simulacrum of the god. This description closely coincides with C. Schuchhardt's discoveries in his excava- tions on the island of Riigen; he found on the site of the ancient Arkona traces of a quadrilateral construction, with an internal nucleus of a quadrangle formed by four pilasters.3 (It seems, too, that the remains of the pagan temple at Uppsala (Gamla Uppsala), under the Christian church of the twelfth century,4 also reveal a quadrangular plan similar to that of the temple at Arkona.5) The existence of real temples amongst the western Slavs is thus certified; and their genetic dependence on the Germanic temple, in the general picture of Nordic culture, appears highly probable.6 All this is so evident that even Wienecke is obliged to recognize it; but he admits the validity of the archaeological evidence only in the case of the Baltic Slavs, and their temples,' and persists in denying the existence of temples amongst the eastern Slavs. In the case of the western Slavs, he allows that they had temples, but maintains that these did not contain images of the gods, basing his statement on his interpretation of the literary sources; he does not, of course, take into account the organic interdependence of temple and image. For what purpose, then, were these temples used? Not only, indeed, as places of social reunion and banqueting,8 as dep6ts for the sacred treasure accumulated through the gifts of the faithful and the booty taken from enemies,9 but also-according to Wienecke-for some kind of cult; this cult, 1 IV, 26. 2 XIV, pp. 564 ff. 3 C.

PETTAZZONI however, made no use of idols or images, but was centred upon some object belonging to the god, or representative of him: Triglav's saddle at Stettin;1 Gerovit's shield at Wolgast;2 or the saddle, bridle and sword of Svantevit at Arkona.8 Sacred and symbolic objects such as these were, according to Wienecke, venerated in the temples, but not the images of the gods, these being but fantasies of the mediaeval authors. Wienecke is obliged to submit to the archaeological evidence which proves the existence of the temples; but he maintains his uncompromising denial of the existence of the images. And in this he seems to have a good case, for divine simulacra which can be attributed to the western Slavs and their pagan temples have not hitherto been found, with the exception of the somewhat disputable Galician "monu- ment" of Husjatyn which has already been mentioned.4 Yet in the course of Schuchhardt's excavations at Arkona there were found the remains of a foundation which it is not unreasonable to suppose may have been the pedestal supporting the gigantic image of the god which Saxo describes.5 These traces of a possible pedestal were situated within the internal quadri- lateral forming the tabernacle of the temple of Svantevit; they were not in the centre of the quadrangle, but rather towards its eastern side. But Wienecke affects to doubt even this evidence, and maintains that this construction probably belongs to an earlier building,6 of which, however, there does not seem to be any other trace.7 On the whole, it is, strictly speaking, true that the archaeological evidence which is valid for the existence of the temples is not convincing for the existence of the images; for even if it is admitted that this pedestal belonged to the temple destroyed in 1168, we do not know for certain that an image stood on it; still less, that it was a quadricephalous image, such as that of Svantevit which Saxo describes. But arguments e silentio are not entirely conclusive and the archaeological silentium on the subject of images, even of polycephalous images, upon which Wienecke lays such emphasis, is not so complete as he pretends, as will be shown. Certainly, when we read of the golden simulacrum of the god of Rethra in Adam, of the "aurea imago" of Triglav in Ebbo, of its "tria capita deargentata" according to the monk of Priifening, of the silver moustaches of the god Tjarnaglofi ("Black head")8 in the Knytlinga Saga,9 of the wooden idol of Perun "with silver head and golden moustaches" mentioned in JVestor's Chronicle,o0 of the many "vases of gold and silver" and all the precious accumulation of treasure in the pagan temples of the western Slavs as described 1 Ebbo, II, '3. 2 Herbord, III, 6; Ebbo, III, 8. 3 Saxo, XIV, p. 564, ed.

Wienecke argues that the metallurgical arts were not sufficiently advanced among the Slavs to enable them to produce such rich and fine objects as the monks describe, and that this is a further proof of the unreliability of their accounts. But one need not assume that this goldsmith's work was executed by the Slavs themselves; indeed one of the objects is explicitly stated to be of foreign origin, namely the "bowl of exquisite workmanship" (exquisiti cultus poculum), forming part of the treasure of the temple of Svantevit at Arkona, which was the gift of a Christian prince, King Sveno of Denmark,3 who had not scrupled to pay homage to the abominable heathen god. And if this also is to be regarded as an invention, one wonders why Saxo-always so zealous in the interests of the Danish church and the Danish crown--did not invent some- thing more to the credit of the Christian faith and of the sovereign who professed it. Moreover Herbord mentions4 amongst the votive offerings in the temple of Triglav at Stettin "large gilded ox-horns encrusted with gems"; it is true that this description somewhat resembles that of the gold plate in the temple of Solomon,5 but it is closer still to the golden horns, already described,6 which were found in Denmark, at Gallehus near Tondern in south Jutland. And the manner in which these horns disappeared in 1802 (they were stolen and immediately melted down) helps us to realize why it is that so few of the precious sacred objects have come down to us. In connection with the cult of Svantevit at Arkona two rites were cele- brated annually, one of which necessitated the examination of the contents of a drinking horn, made of various metals (vario metalli genere excultum),7 which the image of the four-headed god held in its right hand (whence we must again suppose that the image existed, unless the rite also is an in- vention). A figure with a horn in its hand occurs in many monuments of the so-called baba type (kamennye baby), those roughly carved stones which are found in various parts of Russia, and even further east from the Caucasus towards Central Asia.8 Some have even been found in the Baltic 1 Mon.

PETTAZZONI region,- and at least one in the island of Riigen itself: a granite stele, walled into the entrance to the sacristy of the church of Altenkirchen, not far from Arkona,2 on which is carved a male figure (still called "Svantevit" by the local inhabitants) who is lifting up a huge drinking horn with both hands. The face is bearded, as was the custom amongst the Rugians3 and as is the idol of Svantevit described by Saxo, with two great moustaches, which bring to mind those of Tjarnaglofi in the Knytlinga Saga, and of the idol of Perun at Kiev, as described in Nestor's Chronicle.4 Furthermore, in some instances these baby are related to polycephalous images, and with precisely four heads: such, for example, was the "statue," popularly known as Cetyrebog ("Fourgod"), which up to 1850 (it is now lost) stood near the church of Tesnovka in the district of Radomyst (Kiev).5 Another, also with four heads, stood "on a hill in the Dnieper valley on the road from Reiica to Bobruisk."6 These polycephalous baby must have repre- sented some superhuman being, and thus bear witness against the interpre- tation of all baby as solely sepulchral monuments, as has sometimes been affirmed.7 A similar ambivalence between the human and the divine is found in another class of monuments, namely the above-mentioned sculptured steles of the second to third centuries A.D. which are found in large numbers in the territory of ancient Thrace, and which represent a man riding a horse -the "Thracian Rider"--who is galloping in pursuit of various animals.8 These monuments also oscillate in character between the grave-stone and the cult image; and here again the figure is both human and divine, and in some cases polycephalous, as has already been mentioned, with three (and in one case two) heads (P1. 14c). In some examples of the "Thracian Rider" the figure holds the horn (of abundance).9 The polycephalous gods of the Baltic Slavs were not represented on horseback, yet the sources agree in speaking of sacred horses in connection with them. Such a horse is assigned to ZuarasiE quatuor"), between four tall poles. This arrangement recalls that of the four curtains which formed the quadrilateral tabernacle within the sanctuary of Svantevit at Arkona, see above, p. 141 (L. Weber, Archiv f.

The two golden horns which were found, the one in 1639 and the other in 1734, at Gallehus (Denmark) seem to have come from the Danubian region, or perhaps from South Russia. One of them shows, amongst other decorations, a masculine figure (front view) with three heads (P1. I4b). We mentioned at the beginning the numerous monuments with three-headed figures which testify to the existence of a tricephalous god in the Celtic paganism of Gaul (P1. I3). Thus the circle draws ever closer around the Baltic Slavs. And although their polycephalous idols are known to us only from literary sources, it will be, I think, difficult henceforward to separate the literary evidence from the archaeological testimony provided by the above-named monuments, deriving from the Slav, the Thracian, the Celtic, and (although eventually by transmission) the Germanic worlds. Thus Wienecke's criticism, though legitimate in principle and in some ways meritorious, appears excessive in its systematic negation. The images with four, five, or seven heads, rather than being mere rhetorical amplifications tending to increase the odium against Slav paganism by accentuating more and more the monstrosity of its gods, may be explained as so many variations on the iconographical motive of polycephaly, which kept its fundamental significance whatever the number of heads on the images may have been. A carved wooden image (P1. I4f), which comes from Obdorsk in Siberia, near the mouth of the river Obi, shows seven human heads placed vertically one above the other2 on a trunk. This appears to mean the pillar of the world, which is divided into seven parts in the cosmology as well as in the religion of the Finno-Ugric and Siberian peoples, and which is sometimes represented by a pole on which the shamans--to whom the pillar of the world represents the goal of the journey which they undertake in order to bring the soul of a dead person to heaven-carve with a knife the faces of the divine beings who dwell in the various heavens. The Ostyaks call it simply "the wood with the faces of God," and their god of heaven, Siinke, is invoked as "the sublime father of the seven (heavens) who looks in three directions."3 More- over, amongst the thousands of idols, mostly of wood, relating to the religion of the Ostyaks and Samoyeds, there have been found some with several heads (or rather faces) disposed horizontally in the usual way, not vertically. Chief amongst these was the idol of Weesakko, "the old," worshipped by the Samoyeds of the island of WaigatS, who had seven (sometimes three) faces ;4 1 Cf. the passage in Annales Augustani (anno S135) reproduced in Meyer (Fontes, pp. 56-7) : "equo quem pro deo in Rheda colebant."

PETTAZZONI this is an example of a latitude as to the number of the heads similar to that found amongst the polycephalous idols of the Baltic Slavs. Possibly it was from the Balto-slavic regions (and from Lithuania) that the iconographical type of the polycephalous divine figure was propagated, and spread northwards through Finland to the Siberian populations' (though the possibility is not to be excluded that there may have been some penetra- tion of religious ideas and forms coming from central or southern Asia, as suggested, perhaps, by the cosmological conception of the seven heavens, or by the iconographical motive of the many heads distributed one above the other, as found in many figures of Lamaist Buddhism (Avalokiteivara) and Indian Sivaism).2 But this only transfers the genetic problem to another field, namely to the polycephalous simulacra of the Nordic culture, in which, as was said above, the Baltic Slavs participated. The divine polycephalous image (in its tricephalous form) is found again, as was said, in Roman Gaul, where are also examples of temples quadrangular in plan and with ambu- latories, corresponding to the Nordic temples of Uppsala and Iceland, and to the Balto-Slavic temple found at Arkona.3 As a direct transmission of cultural elements from Gaul to the Germano-Slavic area is unlikely,4 and as the Gallo-Roman temple points to more remote pre-Roman origins, and, through the Celts of the Danubian region, to more remote Mediterranean,5 and Asiatic (Iranian)6 connections as well, it is presumably in this direction that one should look for the iconographical prototypes of the polycephalous figures which appear in the above-mentioned steles of the "Thracian Rider." Behind the Thracian "god on the horse" are the various horse-riding gods of Asia Minor and of Syria,7 and behind these again is the Persian and Iranian Mithra, who, in the Avesta, traverses heaven in a flaming chariot jeden," Mimoires de la Socidtd Finno-ougrienne, LIII, Helsinki, 1924, PP- 79-80. Another idol with seven heads was seen by Veniamin amongst the Samoyeds (Ibid., pp. 77-8). 1 The Russian custom (of Viking origin according to Rozniecki, Archiv.f. slaw. Philol., XXIII, p. 496) of swearing on one's own arms (cf. Nestor's Chronicle, under the year 971: "If we do not abide by what is said above S. . may we become as yellow as this gold and be torn in pieces with our own weapons" ; cf. also under the years 907 and 945) is also to be found among the Ostyaks (see Kar- jalainen, Die Religion der Jugra- V1lker, III, Helsinki, 1927, p. 182). The "gold" in the formula of the oath refers to the personal ornaments of the warriors which were taken off and placed together with the arms when the oath was sworn (Nestor's Chronicle: "they put down their arms, their shields, and their gold"); cf. Mansikka, Die Religion der Ost- slaven, pp. 34, 37, note 2. (It is probable that the image may have been suggested by an illness which turns the sufferer "yellow"; cf. F.

But in the mithraea of the imperial Roman period he is represented as actually on horse-back, as at Dura-Europos2 or at Dieburg in Germany,3 where, on the great marble slab on the back wall, Mithra again appears as a rider-huntsman, with bow and arrows, instead of in the usual attitude of slaying the bull--a substitution which possibly suggests religious and iconographical influences from Thrace.4 And it is also on the same slab at Dieburg, in one of the small square bas-reliefs in the frame of the slab, that one finds a representation of a tree with three human heads amongst the leaves.5 This figure has been related to the rpLTcxaLtoq Mlepaoc of Pseudo-Dionysius,6 and has also suggested comparison with the three- headed Thracian Rider.7 Mithra is a solar god; the cavalier gods of Syria have radiate heads;8 those of Asia Minor are, in the Hellenistic-Roman interpretation, identified with Helios and Apollo ; the Thracian Rider is designated in inscriptions as Apollo10 and sometimes also has rays round the head (P1. I4e).11 Moreover the tricephalous head from Gaul appears amongst the seven busts of divinities on the so-called "planetary vases" (P1. I4a), as the god who presides not over Tuesday (as some think), nor over Saturday (as others would have it), but over Sunday, the dies solis, as I propose to demonstrate elsewhere. The polycephalous gods of the Baltic Slavs are also horse-riding gods, each with his sacred horse-the white horse of Svantevit (Saxo), the black horse of Triglav (Herbord)-and the horse is venerated as the incarnation of the god himself.12 Furthermore, one of these cavalier gods--the Zuarasib of the Redarii, described by Thietmar,13 is, as regards its name, identical with the Svarotyc of the paleo-Russian Homilies mentioned above.

This god Svarozy&amp;-Zuarasic is, therefore, one of the few elements which the religion of the Russian Slavs has in common with that of the Baltic Slavs and which has been explained either by transmission from the Baltic Slavs to the Russians (Jagid)2 or, in the opposite direction, from Russia to the Baltic (Wienecke).3 But it is better to regard this common element in the two religions as deriving from their common proto-Slav patrimony, all the more so since there are traces, amongst the Lithuanians, of a myth of the sun as having been made by (which may be equated with being the son of) a celestial blacksmith.4 Another common element between the two religions is provided by the idols and divine images which, according to Nestor's Chronicle (under the year 98o), existed amongst the Russians. It is true that this evidence must also be used with caution,5 and we ought not to believe in the existence of an idol of Perun really exhibiting a silver head and golden moustaches merely because we find amongst the Baltic Slavs a golden idol of Radigast at Rethra;6 at Stettin a Triglav of gold,7 or with three silver heads ; and at Riigen a Tjarnaglofi with silver moustaches.9 But this question of the use of gold and silver--metals which by their brightness are most suitable for the representation of the brightest of all gods, the Sun-can be elucidated in an unexpected way from a source which certainly does not depend on the Vulgate, namely Herodotus's account of the customs of the Issedones.1o This tribe lived to the east of the Ural mountains in the basin of the Iset and Tobol rivers, tributaries of the Obi (the name Iset preserves traces of the tribal name Issedoi or Issedones, cf. the Iastai of Ptolemy), the fabulous land of gold, for the possession of which the Arimaspoi struggled with the Gryphs."1 When one of the Issedones died, his son was expected to celebrate the obsequies in the following manner. The body of the dead man was cut up and eaten in common at the funeral banquet. (The same custom is attributed by Herodotus to the Massagetai, who worshipped the sun as the only god and sacrificed horses in his honour "because the swiftest of animals is the offering best adapted to the swiftest of divine beings").12 The head, however, was preserved and gilded (xMTrOxpUooao); and 1 Cf.

Finally, it may be noted that the solar association explains polycephaly in its comprehensive sense, as being an iconographical expression of the power of looking in two, three, four, or more, directions at a time-that is, ideally, in all directions-and hence of possessing that all-seeing capacity which is attributed to the Sun more properly than to any other divinity. That the all-seeing Sun has been conceived in tricephalous form is clear, e.g., from various monuments of Persian mediaeval art, such as the one here reproduced (Pl. I5b), an inlaid bronze vase at Teheran dating from the end of the twelfth century.1 In one of the characteristic round medallions on the central band of ornament on this vase there is a representation of the solar disc with three faces, and below the figure of a lion,2 that typically solar animal.3 Since the negative criticism of Wienecke has now been shown to be excessive, the way is open for a more positive examination of the historical problem of the possible participation of the ancient peoples of Europe in a common solar religion, based on the cult of a polycephalous god. Such an enquiry should keep the iconographical aspect of the problem distinct from its genetic aspect, bearing in mind that although the tricephalous type, especially in the form of a horse-riding god, suggests probable oriental origins, the religion of a solar deity may have deeper and more ancient roots in the soil of Europe. Hence may come, I believe, a positive contribution to the genetic problem of the three-headed type of the Christian Trinity, as having a pagan origin. Since the researches of Didron4 the view has prevailed that this type arose in mediaeval France whence it was propagated through Europe, including eastern Europe.5 This theory was strengthened by the discovery of a number of iconographic representations of the Gallic tricephalous god on Gallo- Roman monuments." And the gap of many centuries which extends between these monuments and the earliest three-headed representations of the Trinity7 1 A Survey of Persian Art, VI, P1. 1314 A; III, p. 2492. 2 For the same motive (a three-faced solar disc and a lion) see ibid., VI, Pls. 1317 A, 1328; in another example (P1. 1311 D) the sun has only one face. 3 W.

PETTAZZONI can be partially bridged, in France, through the three-headed, or three- faced, figures found in romanesque sculpture. The genetic continuity is shown by the persistence of certain iconographical details (such as the four eyes for the three faces) which are transmitted from ancient to mediaeval art. "Another proof of continuity is the fact that tricephalous figures are found in the same region at both epochs (antiquity and the Middle Ages)," affirms Madame Durand-Lefebure, who concludes: "It was neither Geryon nor the triple Hecate ... who furnished the artists of the Middle Ages with the theme of the tricephalous figure, with or without a beard, but the indigenous sculp- ture which they had before their eyes."1 The evidence that a tricephalous god existed amongst many other pagan peoples of barbarian Europe would seem to necessitate a revision of the theory of the Gallic origin of this form. "It is possible," writes G. J. Hooge- werff with particular reference to the three-headed "Thracian Rider," "that it is not in Celto-Roman Gaul but in the Balkans that one should look for the origins of this form, at least as regards the countries of Europe."2 But perhaps the true answer is to be found, not by substituting one monogenetic solution for another, but in a possible polygenetic origin. There were two Christian applications of the pagan iconographical type of the three-headed god, the one diabolical, the other divine. The first is naturally the most obvious and spontaneous. Zuarasiz diabolus, wrote Bruno of Querfurt in Ioo8,3 a formula which expresses the spirit of the interpretatio christiana in its essential difference from the interpretatio romana (or graeca and others): for Christian monotheism every pagan divinity can only be "a false and lying god," a demon.4 The name of the supreme god of meteoric sky,5 called Perun amongst the Russians, Perkinas amongst the Lithuanians, passed into the language of the Finnic populations of Karelia (piru, peruni) and of Estonia (porgel) with the meaning of "Devil."6 The same transference takes place in iconography. As the Gallic Cernunnos,7 the "horned" god, transmitted his horns to the devil, so the tricephalous god bequeathed to him his three heads. The bust of a tricephalous and horned devil is carved in relief above one of the biforae which flank the central rosace of the church of S. Pietro at Tuscania (P1. I5a), which dates from the twelfth century.8 But the three-headed devil seated on a running lion (?) who figures on a twelfth century Swedish carpet (P1. i5c) from Skog (Norrland)9 represents a very different type; the entire 1 Marie Durand-Lefebure, Art gallo-romain et sculpture romane, Paris, 1937, p. 161. 2G.

How did these two opposite Christian applications of the same form arise? Ideologically it is impossible to conceive that the devil with three heads can be the immediate iconographical ante- cedent of the Holy Trinity, or vice versa. That which was pagan may become Christian; but that which, to Christianity itself, was diabolical, cannot become divine. The two opposite iconographical applications, the diabolical and the divine, do not derive from one another, but both derive directly from their common pagan prototype. But the manner is different, because the spirit is different. On the one hand is a more lively religious spirit, the same as that which had brought about the destruction of the pagan idols, and which now expressed itself in the degradation of their images to the level of demons. On the other hand, there is rather an aesthetic intuition used in the service of theological thought. In the diabolic application there still vibrates the echo of the fight against paganism and the enthusiasm for the triumph of the faith. The divine application is more meditative and calm; the figure of the pagan three-headed god is henceforward emptied of all religious content and reduced to a pure form, a form which seems to furnish the solution of an insoluble problem, that of the iconographical representation of the mystery of the Triune divinity. By an analogous development the pagan steles of the ancient "rider god" of the Thracians became, and still are, the object of a Christian cult in some country churches of Bulgaria, because the faithful see in the cavalier god the image of Saint George.3 All this can only happen at a time sufficiently distant from the destruction of paganism, when the latter is quite dead and there is no possibility of its resurrection. It is a fact that the earliest representations of a tricephalous Christian Trinity which we have found are chronologically later than those of the tricephalous devil. They begin to become frequent in the fourteenth century and triumph in the great art of the Renaissance (Andrea del Sarto, Pollaiuolo, etc.). But already in the Quattrocento the first theological protests against this monstrous and profane representation begin to make themselves heard; and it is definitely condemned, after the Counter Reformation, by a bull of Pope Urban VIII in 1628, which was confirmed by Pope Benedict XIV. This did not prevent the survival in popular devotion of the tricephalous image of the Trinity (P1. I6a), which was still widely venerated in the nine- teenth century, for example in some parts of the Tirolese Alps (P1. I6b). 1See above, pp. 135, 146. 2Another interesting example occurs in the miniature of a Psalter from Smolensk, 14th century. It shows the main portal of a church the architecture of which has points of resemblance to pagan temples. On each of the two side pilasters is a masculine tri- cephalous head, derived from pagan icono- graphy and here used to represent the devil, who is immobilized through having been, so to speak, nailed to the two pilasters, so that he can do no more harm: W.
