MAY COLLECTION A major special exhibition of exotic art from Oceania opens to the public on August 22 and continues through October 19. St. Louis has not seen a comparable exhi- bition of "primitive art" since the Paul Tishman collection of African art was shown here precisely four years ago. Now the Museum is presenting less familiar but equally exciting South Pacific art selected primarily from the extensive Morton D. May collection. From an available corpus of about 600 objects, 250 of the artistically best and ethnographically rarest examples will be dramatically displayed in the five Special Exhibition Galleries in the Museum's west wing. Specially designed installations and a comprehensive catalogue are made possible by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. Lee A. Parsons, Associate Curator of Pre-Columbian and Primitive Art, has prepared the exhibition catalogue, illustrating all objects in the exhibition which were recently photographed by Jack Savage, St. Louis. Prominent specialists in Oceanic art, Douglas Newton, Director of the Museum of Primitive Art in New York, and Philip Dark, Professor of Anthropology at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, present public lectures in the auditorium, August 19 and September 23, re- spectively. Several classic documentary films will be screened during the course of the exhibition. Ritual Arts of the South Seas encompasses the vast area stretching from Sumatra, bordering the Indian Ocean, to Easter Island in the eastern Pacific, for the most part the area between the Equator and the Tropic of Capricorn. "Oceania" includes the continent of Australia, the islands of Indonesia northward to the Philippines, the Melanesian islands east of Australia including New Guinea, the complex of islands and atolls farther north called Micronesia, as well as all of Poly- nesia from Samoa to New Zealand and Hawaii. Only Micro- nesia is excluded from the exhibition, for ritual art is not prevalent in that area. Australia and Indonesia are represented by a few outstanding objects, and several dozen rare 18th and 19th century pieces portray the far-flung islands of Polynesia. Four-fifths of the exhibition concentrates on Melanesia. Whereas the native arts of Polynesia are subtly restrained and intellectualized in their emphasis on geometric</page><page sequence="3">76 lines and graceful functional forms, the arts of Melanesia are dramatically emotional and expressionistic in their emphasis on color, tension and highly imaginative abstract forms. These qualities mirror the differences in the societies that produced them and at the same time communicate compellingly to our 20th century tastes, regardless of our understanding of the cultural and ritual basis for the art. This well-rounded exhibi- tion from the South Seas, however, should contribute signifi- cantly to our comprehension and appreciation of an aspect of universal human creativity. And it is not sufficiently acknowledged that much of this particular art was invented by essentially Negroid peoples who have inhabited Melanesia for millennia. Two Melanesian ritual objects are illustrated. The unusual polished wooden drum from New Ireland represents an animal lying on its back with legs and tail schematized as hooked prongs and serving as sounding boards for the instru- ment. The drum was held between the legs while the musi- cian drew his resin covered fingers over the prongs to produce a three-note groaning sound. The eyes of the animal are inlaid with sea snail operculum and the incisions are filled with white lime. The helmet mask from the Papuan Gulf of New Guinea is an important ceremonial accoutrement formerly in the collections of the Museum für Völkerkunde, Vienna. It represents a "sea spirit" monster,· projecting behind is the serrated back of a crocodile, an anthropomorphic bird face comprises the front, while another bird head surmounts the top. This fantastic construction was fabricated by stretching bark cloth over a cane foundation. Zones of color are separated by thin strips of cane on the surface and a raffia fringe en- circles the bottom of the mask. St. Louis is indebted to Morton D. May for placing one of the nation's largest and finest collections of Oceanic art on indefinite loan to its Museum. The Museum, itself, has accumulated a small collection of Oceanic art, and the finest examples will supplement the May material in the exhibition. These have not been shown in the Museum for a decade owing to lack of exhibition space. In addition, one famous New Guinea wood sculpture has been lent by Washington University. However, the nucleus of the exhibition demon- strates one man's acumen in art collecting. The objects vary from delicate bone or shell jewelry to monumental wood sculptures as much as twenty feet in size. The diverse and expressive character of South Seas art inevitably provides a powerful experience.
