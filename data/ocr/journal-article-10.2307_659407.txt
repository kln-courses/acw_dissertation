Inst., Lond., 1905, xxxv, 13- 19.) Discusses activity of the society, publications of members, anthropology in universities, physical deterioration, etc. Advocates the adoption in anthro- pology of "a binominal, or better still, a trinominal system of nomenclature, combined with a well-organized system of registration." Bethe (E.) Mythus, Sage, Mdirchen. (Hess. Bl. f. Volksk., Lpzg., 1905, Iv, 97-142.) Discusses the nature and characteristics of myth, sage and mar- chen. Dr B. considers a mndrchen to be " the common property of all of the many peoples of Asia, Europe, and at least the North of Africa," - an inter- national being that takes on nationality, so that, whether it be Finn or German, the folk-soul lies in it. The mdrchen has eternal youth. The sage is bound (not free like the mdrchen) to places, customs, times ; it tells not of " a king," but of "IKing Gunther," not of "a castle," but of "Troy castle." It has not the charmingly indefinite "once upon a time." The myth can arise from any of the several equally justified roots of religion, cult of the dead, ensoulment of nature, etc., perhaps even fetishism. Mdrchen, sage, and myth have all had to do one with another and the web of their interweaving is often most beautiful. Broomall (H. L.) The significance of errors in speech. (Proc. Del. Co. Inst. Sci., Media, Pa., 19o6, I, no. 2, 30-45.) According to the author, the evolution of language is "imitation modified by in- creasing significance and decreasing ef- fort." From this "errors" arise (many examples are given). Every correct form of language was or will be an error and every error was once correct or rep- resents forms that will sometime be cor- rect. The error is only an error in time. It is the sign of life. By it the living language is distinguished from the dead. English abundantly exemplifies this. Conybeare (F. C.) Die jungfrauliche Kirche und die jungfriiuliche Mutter. Eine Studie iiber den Ursprung des Mariendienstes. (Arch. f. Religsw., Lpzg., 1905, VIII, 373-389; 1906, IX, 73-86.) Treats of the development of the idea (in a mythoplastic age) of the church personified as a virgin, a virgin bride, the first-born of God, the oldest of all things, domina mater ecclesia, the spiritual mother of Christ, the bride of God, the bride of Christ, etc. The early hymnology uses these expressions of the church and not of Mary - Mari- olatry comes later.

Discusses views of various philosophers and men of sci- ence concerning death, particularly the recent view of Bolk, who distinguishes sexual and somatic death among the higher animals. The natural death of the human being is sex-death. Dieterich (A.) Hermann Usener. (Arch. f. Religsw., Lpzg., 1905, vIII, i-xi, portr. ) Appreciative sketch of life and scientific activities (d. Oct. 21, 1905). Among Usener's chief works were: Kallone (1867), Italische Mythen (1875), Epicurea (1887), Gbtternamen ( 1896), Sintflutsage (1899), Dreiheit (1903). Usener was a great philologist and a pioneer in the science of religion. Drews (P.) Das Abendmahl und die Dimonen. (Hess. Bl. f. Volksk., Lpzg., 1905, IV, 176-205.) Treats of the folk- lore of the Lord's Supper, particularly in regard to its protective power against demons. Nowhere else was the collision of Christian-divine and heathen-demoni- acal power so marked as in the Lord's Supper,-fear of profanation of the ele- ,ments, etc., and the incoming of mortal ,sin, accidents of handling and partaking, participation of the ungodly and the un- worthy, cup and water, etc. Belief in the demon onset has passed largely, but the customs and rules remain. Fgrteckning 6fver vetenskapliga skrifter af professor Hjalmar Stolpe. (Ymer, Stockholm, 1905, XXV, 445-446.) List of scientific writings (37 items, 1872- 1904) of the late H. Stolpe. Fiirst (K. M.) Om Aldersanatomi. (Ibid., 76-89.) General discussion of the growth of the body and its organs ac- cording to age-stature, head measure- ments, internal organs, skeleton, blood, etc. The divisions of life recognized are : childhood ( 1-15 or 16 years), youth (15-20 or 25), adult age ( 20-25-45-50), age of regression (50-65-70), senility (7o and over). Geddes (J.) Simpler spelling. (Educa- tion, Boston, 1906, xxvI, repr. p. 1-9.) Argues for a "universal alphabet that willbeused." With a universal alphabet spelling reform will come of itself. Re- forms in other lands are noted. Goldstein (F.) Die Menschenopfer im Lichte der Politik und der Staatswissen- schaft. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1906, LXXXIX, 37-41.) Discusses the sacrifice of human beings past and present (ancient Mexican priestly offerings, sacrifices of war-prisoners, cruel punishment of do- mestic and foreign enemies, criminals, etc., infanticide, sacrifice of widows, slaves, etc.). So far as politics are con- cerned, according to G. the object of human sacrifice was the punishment in the most cruel way possible of enemies and the spreading abroad of fear, in order to make easier the ruling of the many. Infanticide and slave sacrifices probably served private economic ends. Hall (G. S.) The undeveloped races in contact with civilization. (Bull. Wash. Univ. Assoc., St Louis, 1906, IV, 145- 150.) Abstract of lecture. Argues against man as exterminator, the exhaus- tion and depletion of indigenous popula- tions (e. g. in Congo) by the whites and the making over of others (Ameri- can Indian) into "a cheap imitation of the white man," the deepening of the color line against the negro, etc. Ingegnieros (J.) D'une classification des criminels fond6e sur la psychopathologie. (Rev. Scient., Paris, 1906, ve s., v, 648-651.) Outlines a psychopatholog- ical classification of criminals. The di- visions are: I. Moral anomalies (dis- thimic) ; 2. intellectual anomalies (dis- gnosic) ; 3. volitional anomalies (dis- boulic). Each of these has three subdi- visions: Congenital, acquired, transitory. Besides these three groups there is another including composite types. Knapp (C.) Elis~e Reclus. (Bull. Soc. Neuchat. de G6ographie, Neuchftel, 1905, xvI, 310-316.) Biographical sketch and appreciation of chief works of great Belgian geographer and ethnog- rapher. Le Double (M.) L'6volution des os de la face. (Rev. Scientif., Paris, 1906, ve s., 548-556, 584-590.) Treats of the evolution of the bones of the face in the animal series and in man, variations and abnormalities of growth, monstrosi- ties, etc. Dr L. attributes the slow and progressive reductions in the dimensions of the maxillaries to the struggle between the brain and the jaw, effect of milder manners (choice of food, cooking, etc.) on the size and volume of the teeth ; also to hereditary selection. Lehmann (E.) Teufels Grossmutter. (Arch. f. Religsw., Lpzg., 1905, VIII, 411-430.) Treats of "the devil's grand- mother" in literature, madrchen, myths, etc., particularly Teutonic (with ana- logues elsewhere).</page><page sequence="9">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 587 Lombroso (C.) A propos des caract&amp;res d6g6n6ratifsdu crime et du g9nie. (Rev. Scient., Paris, 19o6, ve s., v, 795.) Note in reply to M. Le Double's remarks in a previous number. Lombroso main- tains that physical malformations "are only external signs, not corollaries." Genius, with crime and madness, is a branch of the tree of epilepsy-a fertile, even wonderful, product of epileptic de- generation. v. Luschan (F.) Ueber ein rachitisches Schimpanseeskelett. (Z. f. Ethn., Ber- lin, 19o6, xxxvIII, 115-120, 4 pl.) Describes, with measurements, the skel- eton of a male chimpanzee ca. 15 years old (long in the Dresden Zo6logical Gar- den), the skull and pelvis of which are particularly rachitic. This skeleton is compared with that of a sound adult animal of the same size. Mantegazza (P.) Il preteso pregiudizio delle razze. (A. p. l'Antrop., Firenze, 1905, xxxv, 303-310.) Critique of Fi- not's recent volume Le prdjugi des races (inspired "1by the fatal and mad word equality "). M. does not agree with Fi- not's conclusions that " the psychology of peoples demonstrates their mental unity," and "the virtues and vices of a race are but the effects of historical circumstances or of the influence of environment." - Darwin dopo cinquant' anni. (Ibid., 311-322.) Sums up the results of Dar- win's views and influence-the "1temple of evolution" has not remained quite as it was built. "Evolution" is too Eng- lish, too utilitarian, and "natural selec- tion " has been "overworked." Parsons (Elsie C. ) The religious dedica- tion of women. (Amer. J. Sociol., Chicago, 1906, xI, 585-622.) Dis- cusses this topic from the crudest form (wives of the gods among the natives of Guinea) to the modern nun and Protest- ant church-goer. Author holds that in the phenomena involved "1we discover one of the many impressive series of so- cial factors which have contributed so richly to the development of human per- sonality." When woman was a chattel, male ownership kept her chaste, and " now religion seems to safeguard the products of a social means that is out- grown.'" Parsons (F. G.) and Box (C. R.) The relation of the cranial sutures to age. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1905, xxxv, 30-38.) Gives results of examination of 82 skulls, mostly of lower and mid- dle class English people (from St Thomas Hospital) with respect to ectocranial and entocranial sutures- ages of subjects 17-85. Authors agree with Picozzo as to earlier obliteration in males. The lambdoid closes later than the coronal and sagittal as a rule. Signs of a me- topic suture occurred in 6 skulls. Ab- sence of internal obliteration indicates an age below 30, while after 6o all the internal sutures have disappeared. Ecto- cranial sutures are usually open under 30 and obliteration commences below the stephanion. Pradel (F.) Der Schatten im Volksglau- ben. (Mitt. d. Schles. Ges. f. Volksk., Breslau, 1904, H. xII, 1-36.) Inter- esting discussion of the shadow in folk- lore, --shadow as soul, under-world of shadows, shadowlessness of spirits and elves, shadow as essential part of man, fear of loss of shadow under the equator (Amboyna, Old Calabar, etc. ), correla- tion of power and strength with shadow, shadow as protective "demon," form of shadow, loss of shadow (Peter Schlemihl cycle), shadow as " haunt," magic con- nected with shadow (stepping on, urina- ting on), shadow in oaths and legal lore, defiling of water through shadow, medi- cinal virtue and evils of tree-shadows, etc., pregnancy caused by shadow of leaf (Tahiti), proverbs and sayings about the shadow, riddles, etc. Widespread is the idea that man's shadow is his soul. Kopflose Menschen und Tiere in Mythe und Sage. (Ibid., 37-42.) Gives numerous references to the many and widespread myths and stories concerning headless men (often with head under arm) and animals. Horses in particular appear headless in association with the headless wild huntsmen. Dr P. sug- gests as sources of such myths not de- capitation (the spirit of the beheaded was regarded as headless), but ancient burial customs (separation of head from body before cremation, inhumation, etc.). The idea was then carried over to animals. Reid (C. A.) The biological foundations of sociology. (Amer. J. Sociol., Chicago, 1906, xI, 532-544.) Dr R. argues that "races evolve only when placed under influences which, because injurious to the individual, weed out the weak and the unfit, and leave the race to the strong and fit." This accounts for tall and robust negroes, fine Chinese race (city-life for ages). Human beings develop under three stimuli: nutrition, use, injury.</page><page sequence="10">588 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 8, 190o6 Races can be improved only by breeding favorably-varying individuals. There is no reason why we should not rival, and even surpass the Greeks. Improved en- vironment and selective breeding will do it. Retzius (G.) Hjalmar Stolpe. (Ymer, Stockholm, 1905, xxv, 5-16, 3 fgs.) Appreciative sketch of life, scientific ac- tivities, etc., of H. Stolpe, best known by his Developmecnt of primitive orna- ment (1890-1891), and Studies in American ornament (1896). Schlaginthaufen (0.) Das Hautleisten- system der Primatenplanta unter Mitbe- riicksichtigung der Palma. (Morphol. Jahrb., Lpzg., 1904, xxxIII, 577-671; 1905, xxxIv, 1-125, 194 fgs.) In this valuable and detailed monograph, based on the investigations of the soles of 330 Simie and Prosimike and of 365 human soles (European 278, West African negro 5 I, Papuan 24, Japanese, Chinese, East Indian 12), with examination of all the previous literature on the subject (bibl. 109 titles, pages 608-612), Dr S. presents a thorough-going study of the cutaneous crests and furrows of the sole (the palm also is considered) among the primates and several human races - macroscopic and microscopic as- pects, embryology, physiology, topog- raphy (in detail with statistics), etc. In certain peculiarities man and the Ca- tarrhine monkeys belong together (e. g., the triradius, tI3, never occurring typi- cally in the Platyrrhines). The gorilla, the orang, and the chimpanzee resemble man in diverse ways (which is really nearest cannot yet be determined). In man race-differences occur. The Maya- Indians (Wilder) are more primitive than the West African Negroes (S.). The Papuans of northern New Guinea depart most from the original type. The most primitive elements are the " insuloe primarike," from which the crests, etc., develop. Simmel (G.) The sociology of secrecy and of secret societies. (Amer. J. Sociol., Chicago, 19o6, xI, 441-498.) Discusses friendship, marriage, secrecy as a sociological technique (e. g., in commerce), reciprocal confidence (pro- tective character), reticence on an ob- jective basis (secret societies of the Mo- luccas, Gallic druids, etc.), correlation of secrecy and individualistic separate- ness, gradual initiation, ritual, etc. The secret element in societies is a primary sociological fact, the secret society is a secondary structure. Secret associations have always had a significant role in political aristocracies. The secret society seems dangerous because it is secret. Singer (H.) Der Stand der geograph- ischen Erforschung der deutschen Schutzgebiete. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1906, LXXXIX, 77-82.) R6sumbs re- cent geographical literature concerning the German colonies and protectorates in various parts of the world. Starbird (R. S.) The ethnological in Matthew Arnold. (Bull. Wash. Univ. Assoc., St Louis, 1906, Iv, 112-121.) Arnold's use of ethnological terms seems a mere rhetorical flourish, but he used this device "because he felt instinctively a fundamental relation between the prod- ucts of a literary man and the life of that man, between the literary output of an age and some characteristic move- ment of that age, and between literature as a whole and life as a whole." He hits off easily the distinctive marks of a race. One idea pervades his work - let us perfect our race. Swift (E. J.) The school and the indi- vidual. (Ibid., 122-141.) Protests against "the dominant sin of the school- master, the attempt to make children homogeneous." Cites examples of chil- dren who resented direction and coercion. Tjeenk Willink (H. D.) Mammalia voorkomende in Nederlandsch-Indie. (Natuurk. Tijdsch. v. Nederl-Indie, Weltevreden, 1905, dl. LXV, 154-345.) This valuable monograph on the mam- malia of the Dutch East Indies includes notes on the anthropomorphic apes, the Hylobates, Cercopitheci, etc. The local names are given. The maias (as the Dhyaks called the orang) constructs a "nest" in the trees in which it sleeps at night - Dr Buttikofer found so many of these as to lead him to believe that the creature sometimes built a new one every night. An index of names is added. Vram (U. G.) Metodo per determinare l'inclinazione dell' orbita. (A. d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., 19o6, xII, 195-196.) Briefly describes an easy method of find- ing the horizontal inclination of the orbit. Warren (S. 1H.) On the origin of "eolithic " flints by natural causes, espe- cially by the foundering of drifts. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1905, xxxv, 337- 364, I pl.) Treats of classes of " eoliths" (battered surfaces, flaked sur- faces, chipped edges) and the possible</page><page sequence="11">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 589 means of their formation : human agency; water-abrasion by wave-action; water- abrasion by streams, rivers and floods; soil-abrasion ; the drag of ice ; wear and tear on the surface of the ground. The pressure-chipped " eoliths " occur abund- antly in hill-drifts of paleolithic age, but are rare in the contemporary valley gravels. W. does not accept the theory of eolithic man, believing these forms to be the result of natural action. Discus- sion by others, pages 359-363. Weidemann (A.) Alphabet. (Arch. f. Religsw., Lpzg., 19o6, viii, 552-554.) Notes on the " magic " of the 24 letters, the "mystery" of the alphabet, etc., in Greek and early Christian thought. In the early Coptic period 24 personalities developed out of the alphabet. Wittrock (K. J. H.) De olika slagen af folkm~ingdskartor. (Ymer, Stockholm, 1905, xxV, 428-444.) Treats of the different types of maps of density of pop- ulation. EUROPE Abercromby (J.) The chronology of prehistoric glass beads and associated ceramic types in Britain. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1905, xxxv, 256-265, 5 pls.) Enumerates 37 finds of prehis- toric glass beads (particularly ribbed, notched beads of opaque blue vitreous paste) in connection with pottery, etc., in British barrows. The long ribbed and globular vitreous beads (found with cinerary urns with overhanging rims) were imported into Britain ca. 900 (or 8oo)- 600 B. C., during part of the Hallstatt period of central Europe. Bates (W. N.) A signed amphora of Meno. (Amer. J. Archkeol., Norwood, Mass., 190o, IX, I70-I8I, 2 pl., 6 fgs.) Describes a red-figured amphora bearing the signature of the new painter Meno, an Athenian, not otherwise known, ca. 510 B. C., and trained in the black-fig- ured school. He was possibly the grand- father of Meno, the accuser of Phidias. On one side are Leto, Apollo, and Ar- temis, and on the other side of the vase a warrior leading horses. The vase is now in the museum of the University of Pennsylvania - it came from some town in Etruria. Meno has some resemblances to Andocides in style, etc. Baur (P.) Tityros. (Ibid., I57-1I65, I pl., I fg.) Describes a terra-cotta fig- ure (local Theban ware, middle of fifth century, B. C.), now in the Boston Mu- seum of Fine Arts, "representing one of those mythical combinations of animal and man so peculiar to Greek religious thought" - an ithyphallic goat-man, a demon closely related to the Pan and Satyr type. Only five specimens of the type of this statuette are known (2 from Thebes, 2 from Locris, I from Rhodes). An appropriate appellation is Tityros, for the goat-man demon had phallic and other kindred associations. Beddoe (J.) Colour and race. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1905, xxxv, 219-250, 2 pl., I fg.) Discusses color as a race- mark, drawbacks to its use (change with age, fugitiveness after death, operation of various forms of selection, personal equation), systems of classification, rela- tive values of hair and iris color, effects of geographical situation, migration, etc. The maps of Dr B. show the distribution of color and race in central Europe and in the British Isles (tables of pigmenta- tion). Dr B. regrets " the diminution of the old blond lympho-sanguine stock, which has hitherto served England well in many ways, but is apparently doomed to give way to a darker and more mobile type, largely the offspring of the prole- tariat, and more adapted to the atmos- phere of great cities." The brunet type is not gaining in Scandinavia, but the growth of towns may induce a change. In southern Europe the blond seems to persist only by constant reinforcement from the north. There are reasons for believing that man in Europe had origin- ally red hair. Biehringer (F.) Die Sage von Hero und Leander. (Globus, Brnschwg., LXXXIX, 19o6, 94-97.) Discussesthe Hero-Lean- der legend and its distribution( see also Jel- linek's Die Sage von Hero und Leander in der Dichtungq, Berlin, 189o) in Eu- rope (particularly in Teutonic countries). The legend may be of Indian origin, though this is by no means certain. Blaschke (E.) Weinachtsherligeromt ei der Schwenzer Schmiede vor 30 Jahren. (Mitt. d. Schles. Ges. f.

Nekoliko nasasca novaca na skupu u Hrvatskoj i Slavoniji. (Ibid., 176- 192, 7 fgs. ) Treats of nos. 18-25 of numismatic finds (Italian, African, Hun- garian, Teutonic, etc.) in Croatia and Slavonia. Caskey (L. D.) Notes on inscriptions from Eleusis dealing with the building of the porch of Philon. (Amer. J. Ar- chaeol., Norwood, Mass., 1905, IX, 147- 156, I pl.) Treats of 6 inscriptions and the data to be obtained therefrom. The restorers reproduced the building substantially as it was before its destruc- tion; though the workmanship is Roman, the forms are those of the fourth century B. C., copying the best period of Greek architecture, as was the custom of the age. Diehl (-) Kleinere volkskundliche Mit- teilungen aus Archivalien. (Hess. Bl. f. Volksk., Lpzg., 1905, IV, 206-210.) Treats of St John's day celebration in Dreieich in 1578, cemeteries in 161 I and 1710, votive offerings in 1628, a witch of 1663. Dieterich (A.) Griechische und r6mische Religion. (Arch. f. Religsw., Lpzg., 1906, vIII, 474-510.) Resum6s and critiques of recent works (1903-1905) relating to Greek and Roman religion, including Harrison's Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion (Cambridge, 1903), Frazer's Early History of the Kingship (Lond., 1905), Reinach's Cultes, mythes et religions (t.

Fossum (A.) The theatre at Sikyon. (Amer. J. Archaeol., Norwood, Mass., 1905, xx, 263-276, 2 pl., 3 fgs.) De- scribes investigations made in the sum- mer of 1898, with restoration of certain parts. The object of one reconstruction was to deepen the stage according to the method adopted at Priene - "it is of Roman origin and may date from the period when Sikyon superseded Corinth in political significance." Frasseto (F.) Sopra due crani rinvenuti nell' antico sepolcreto di Bovolone ver- onese attribuito ai terramaricoli. (A. d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., 190o6, xiI. 145-153.) Describes two male skulls (indexes, 75.2 and 70.7) in the Florence Anthropological Museum, exhumed in 1876 in the Veronese cemetery of Bovo- lone, attributed to prehistoric terramari- coli, but really Ligurian. Dr F. thinks that the terramaricoli were Ligurians, the terramare being "stations." - Crani rinvenuti in tombe etrusche. (Ibid., 155-182, 6 fgs.) Describes, with measurements 15 skulls (3 pen- tagonoid, 4 ovoid, 8 ellipsoid; 12 male, 3 female) from Etruscan tombs - sutures and special bones are examined in the second part of the article, pages 177-182 (the occipital presents the most variations and anomalies). Dr A. considers the Etruscan (Italy) a mixed people, a view in harmony with linguistic and archeo- logical facts. Like the Italians, they belonged to the Mediterranean race. They arrived in Italy in the 8th century, B. C. Of the crania here considered Io have cephalic indexes under 76. Fiirst (C. M. ) Skelettfynd i jtmtlTndska grafvar fran den yngre jirnAldern.

Describes, with details of measurements, crania and other skeletal remains of three men and two women from the iron age cemetery at As in Jiimtland (see Kjellmark, K. ). Another grave contained the skeletons of two young children. In all 5 males, 3 fe- males, and 2 children are referred to. Of the male skulls two are dolichoce- phalic, one mesocephalic, the female dolichocephalic. Height (estimated) :</page><page sequence="13">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 591 males 162o-17IO mm., females I500- 1580. The dolichocephalic crania represent the characteristic Scandinavian type of the period. The mesocephalic skull resembles the coast-type from mediaeval Trondhjem - a mixed, or for- eign, element. Giuffrida-Ruggeri (V.) Elenco del mater- iale scheletrico preistorico e protostorico del Lazio. (A. d. Soc. Rom. di An- trop., 19o6, xII, 183-189.) Treats of a male skeleton (skull mesocephalic) from an eneolithic grave near Sgurgola, two male skulls from an artificial eneo- lithic grotto at Cantalupo Mandela (in- dices 70.97 and 86.54), a male brachy- cephalic skull from the tombs of the Esquiline, an imperfect male skeleton from Gabii (with excessive development of forearm).

(Ymer, Stockholm, 1905, xxv, 351-371, 32 fgs. ) Describes excavations (4 men's 2 women's, and one child's grave) at a cemetery of the younger iron age near ]As in Jimtland, the objects discovered (iron axes and knives, bells, bit, rings, sword, etc. ; bronze buckles, sword-hilt, etc. ; bead necklaces; bits of silver, and silver coins - Swedish, Anglo- Saxon, etc., 994-1035), also human remains. See Fiirst (C. MA.). Lewis (A. L.) Prehistoric remains in Cornwall. Part 2, West Cornwall. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1905, Xxxv, 427- 434, 2 fgs.) Treats of the "Dance Maen" or "Dawns Maen," a stone circle near Penzance; the "INine Maid- ens " at Boscawen-an, three miles from the first; "Lanyon Quoit " and " Chun Quoit" ; the "Tregaseal Dancing Stones"; the " Men-an-Tol," on the moors north of Lanyon Quoit, and near it the "Men Scryffys" ; the Boskednan circle, the Zennor Quoit," and the "Mul- fra Quoit"; the beehive chambers at Chrysoister, Gulval ; the Trencrom hill- fort; the subterranean passages and chambers at Carnbrae, and the "1Fog- ou" near the "Dance Maen."

Schles. Ges. f. Volksk., Breslau, 1904, H. XII, 44-61.) Re- sum6 and critique of Dr K. Strekelj's monumental Slovenske narodne pesmi (2 vols., Larbach, 1895-1903), with notices of previous literature of the subject.

(Amer. J. Archaeol., Nor- wood, Mass., 1905, Ix, 411-421, 6 pl., 4 fgs.). Treats of 16 geometric vases discovered in 1898-I899 near the center of Peirene, "resembling most closely those found in the lowest geometric layer at Eleusis," and belonging probably to the tenth century B. c., immediately post-Mycenaean. This find, according to Miss N., is "one more link in the chain of evidence in favor of the spread of the Dorian influence along the Isthmus into Attica." Nothing Mycenaean has yet been found at Corinth. The style of decoration is very simple. Nilsson (A.) Aril, spis och ugn. (Ymer,</page><page sequence="15">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 593 Stockholm, 1905, xxv, 193-214, 30 fgs.)

Volksk., Breslau, 1904, H. xII, 61-78.) R6sum6s German folk-beliefs concern- ing freemasons. Their "never-ending work to escape death," "magic" attri- butes, lore relating to symbols of the craft, connection with spirits and with the devil, etc. Old heathen lore has caused much to pass over to the folk- ideas about freemasons, aided by their secret doings and the fact that their great festival day is June 24, St John's day, near the summer solstice and rich in folk-lore and mystic beliefs. Pacala (V.) A Nagyszeben vid~ki resin- atrok lak6helye 6s 6letviszonyai. (F6ldr. K6zlem., Budapest, I905, xxxIII, 307- 325, 350-367, 13 fgs. ). Treats of the life and activities of the people of Resinar near Nagyszeben-dwellings, dress and ornament, weddings, disease and death, funerals, feasts and festivals, agriculture and related pursuits, trade, etc. Old customs and rites are dying out. The "Bethlehem singers" at Christmas and other similar practices at Easter still sur- vive. The wedding ceremonies also are interesting. Pugh (W.) Cockney children's games and chanties. (Grand Mag., Lond., 1906, III, 595-599.) Gives "reminiscences of a writer who was once himself a London Arab, and speaks out of the fulness of knowledge."

(Globus, Brnschwg., 190o6, LXXXIX, 90-92.) Brief account of the numerous remains of pre- historic (bronze and iron age) copper- mining on the Mitterberg near Miihlbach in the Salzburg Alps.

(Ymer, Stockholm, 1905, xxv, 156- 172, 13 fgs. ) Treats of the finds (flints, axes of stone, implements of horn, pot- tery, fragments, etc.) at the " stations " on Lake Ring, the inhabitants of which were probably "lake-dwellers," or lived on rafts (a folk of hunters and fishers). No remains of cereals were found, but hazel-nut shells, raspberry-seeds, fruit- stones, etc. They seem to have been "half-nomadic lake-dwellers." Some of the axes are of the type belonging to the older kitchen middens of Denmark. Robarts (N. F.) Notes on a recently discovered British camp near Walling- ton. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1905, xxxv ; 387-397, 8 fgs. ) Describes ex- cavations and lists objects found (cake of copper, earthenware loom-weights and perforated tiles, animal bones, pot- tery, mealing-stones, flints, partly cal- cined skeleton of child, remains of cre- mations, etc.). The fragments of red Samian ware (ca. Ioo A. D.) found near by, as well as those of a "late Celtic" (ca. 50 B. c.) pedestal urn, may be much later than the camp itself. The remains are those of "a British camp, probably the headquarters of the Bibroci." Rogers (J. D.) The meaning of IiTPOZ in two Teian inscriptions. (Amer. J. Archoeol., Norwood, Mass., 1905, IX, 422-426.) Argues for some connection between the Teian blocks and the nirpyoC" of the Teian inscriptions. Perhaps these blocks were used for deme lists, and "citizens of a certain tower are not those resident in or near a tower, of the city walls, but those enrolled in the deme register, called ripyog because of its fantastic shape which attracted atten- tion and determined ultimately the popu- lar designation." Scholz (0.) Schlesische Tinze. (Mitt. d. Schles. Ges. f. Volksk., Breslau, 1904, H. XIT, 88-91).

Among the types or groups of these names and verses are those attributing droll or fool- ish things to the inhabitants, those refer- ring to the economic situation of the place, those dealing with the moral qual- ities of the people, those based on pecu- liar pronunciations, etc., those nicknames for which no explanation is apparent, those "wandering verses" applied again and again with mere change of name of place, the blason populaire of towns and cities, those verses, etc., referring to the various places in a parish, etc. On pages 165- 166 examples of incorrect and correct interpretations are given. Siebourg (M.) Zwei griechische Gold- tinien aus der Sammlung C. A. Niessen in K6ln. (Arch. f. Religsw., Lpzg., 1906, VIII, 390-410, 2 fgs.) Describes and discusses two gold head-bands with Greek inscriptions from Bet Djibrin (the ancient Baitogabra) between Jerusalem and Ascalon in Judea. The significance of death-wreaths and the accompanying inscriptions is considered at some length - the inscriptions indicate folk-belief in communication with the dead. Some heathen formulke have been taken over by Jews and Christians. Siebs (T.) Ruf, Sang und Spruch beim Aus- und Eintrieb des Viehs. (Mitt. d. Schles. Ges. f. Volksk., Breslau, 1904, H. XII, 97-102.) Treats of the lan- guage used to call and drive away cattle, etc., in Seidorf in the Hirschberg dis- trict. Specimens of the narrative songs used with the call are also cited. Stuart (D. R.) Imperial method of in- scription on restored buildings : Augus- tus and Hadrian. (Amer. J. Archoeol., Norwood, Mass,. 1905, Ix, 427-449.) Hadrian " acted with a chivalrous regard for the memory of the founder that matched or even surpassed the respectful attitude of Augustus." S. finds evidence that C. I. L. VI, 31060 cannot be con- nected with the Palatine Temple of Vic- tory and used as a proof of restoration by Augustus, and that the letters of the in- scription of Agrippa on the Pantheon date back to Hadrian's restoration and no farther. Svens6n (E.) Ordsprlk,. ordstiv ock talesaitt frAn norddstra SmAland. (Sven- ska LandsmAl, Stockholm, 1904, 42- 65.)

Discusses the orthography of place-names on the 1904 map of Norrbothnia. Place-names should be written according to the laws of the language spoken by the people proper to the region --Swedish, Finn- ish, Lapp, as the case may be. Spr k en i Finland, 188o-1900. (Ibid., 132-149, 3 maps). Discusses, with detailed statistics, the distribution of languages in Finland from 1886 to 19oo. During this period the percent- age of Finnish-speaking people increased from 85.29 percent to 86.75 percent, the percentage of Swedish-speaking de- creasing from 14.32 percent to 12.89 percent, although an actual increase in numbers occurred. The numbers of Lapps rose from 961 to 1,336; Russians from 4,195 to 5,939; Germans from 1,720 to 1,925. There were in 19oo ca. 2,000 Gypsies, at least I,1oo Jews, 102 Tatars, some Esths, Polacks, Letts, etc., besides scatterings of various other Euro- pean nationalities. Wilke (A. G.) Zur Entstehung der Spiral-Dekoration. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1906, xxxvIII, 1-33, 76 fgs.) Discusses the origin of the spiral decoration on ceramic objects, etc., from prehistoric central Europe, particularly Butmir. The place of origin of this motif was southern Hungary (Transylvania and Butmir in particular) ; the motif arose through the shifting against one another of concentric semi-circles (the art of cen- tral Europe ca. 2500 B. C.); this accounts for the appearance of the meander and spiral ornaments in widely separated places having no intercourse with one another. Zielinski (T.) Hermes und die Hermetik. (Arch. f. Religsw., Leipzig, 1905, vIII, 321-372; 1906, IX, 25-60.) In this detailed discussion of Hermes and the origin of Hermetic doctrine, philosophy, cosmogony, etc. (there are three dog- matic layers of Hermetic, literature; a higher and a lower Hermetics), the author comes to the conclusion that "Hermet- ics spread from Arcadia over Cyrene to Egypt." AFRICA Biasutti (R.) " Crania /Egyptiaca." Esame di 42 crani di Egiziani antichi conservati nella collezione del Museo Nazionale d' Antropologia, Firenze. (A. p. 1'Antrop., Firenze, 1905, Xxxv, 323-362). Describes, with details of measurements, 42 ancient Egyptian skulls of diverse provenience (Cro-Mag- non type I, Mediterranean 31, Austro- African 7, nannocephalic 2, brachy- cephalic I). The alleged negroid ele- ment is discussed. B. concludes that the population of ancient Egypt was very heterogeneous, having in the lowest stratum a notable proportion of " Austro- African " (Bushmanoid) with some traces of nannocephalic, pigmy types. The brachycephalic element, unlike the Cro-Magnon (very old) and the prevail- ing Mediterranean type, entered Egypt only in the historic period. Other negroid traces are very rare and sporadic. The indigenousness and development in situ of the ancient Egyptians are justified by the African origin of the primitive fond. Binetsch (G.) Beantwortung mehrerer Fragen fiber unser Ewe-Volk und seine Anschauungen. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1906, xxxvIII,34-40o.) Answers to ques- tions concerning: Name, word for God (Afawu), creation-legend (first human beings came from sky in basket), soul (heaven not so good a place as earth for man), spirit, love and worship (sacrifices, etc.), idols (provincial, town, house; good and bad spirits), sorcery, rain- making, sacred animals (leopard, hyena, crocodile, dog, cat; with some tribes sheep, goat, and white-tailed black monkey), mystic ceremonies, witchcraft. Dennett (R. E. ) Notes on the philosophy of the Bavili. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1905, xxxv, 48-55.) Treats of cosmo- logical ideas (everything is a manifesta- tion of Nzambi), temporal ideas (months, seasons), the categories (6 - water, earth, fire, motion, fruitfulness, life), the sacred groves (6 groups of 4 each, corresponding to the categories). The author believes that "beyond fetishism . . . there is a higher form of religion among the Bairli (of Luango), which is connected with certain symbols in the form of: (I) sacred groves, (2) sacred lands and rivers, (3) sacred trees, (4)</page><page sequence="18">596 AAMIERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST LN. s., 8, 1906 sacred animals, (5) omens, and (6) the seasons."

Remains of old aqueducts and hill terraces occur in large numbers throughout Inyanya - the former are said to be "a marvel to all modern engineers who inspect them."

L'alimentation des indig~nes. (Rev. Scient., Paris, 1906, ve s., v, 590-592.) Dr L. thinks (he saw the Kaffirs of S. Africa in 1902) that "the deplorable condition of these natives is due to defect of alimentation " - some- thing like beri-beri or scurvy is epidemic among the coolies. Sudden changes in food and modes of nourishment are dangerous for these people. Mine and prison fare soon kill them, or nearly so. The native menu is always best. Myers (C. S.) Contributions to Egyptian anthropometry. II. The comparative anthropometry of the most ancient and modern inhabitants. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1905, xxxv, 8o-91, 6 curves.) Discusses measurements and indices, vari- ability, frequency-distributions, correla- tion, of prehistoric skulls from Nakada and the heads of fellahin conscripts from Kena and Girga, "living under similar conditions and in the same region of the valley of the Nile as did their Nakada ancestors about 5000 B. C. M. con- cludes that "there is no evidence that the ' prehistoric' and the modern popu- lation of southern "Upper Egypt differ in physical measurements." The homo- geneity of the Egyptians there is the same as it was 7000 years ago. Randall-MacIver (D.) The manufacture of pottery in Upper Egypt. (Ibid., 20-29, 6 pl.) Describes the three kinds of pottery (haematitic, painted, house- hold - the first, original in Nubia; the second, confined to two or three places between Assuin and Keneh; the third, manufactured everywhere north of As- suAn but foreign to Nubia) chiefly made in Upper Egypt to-day. Comparison with ancient Egyptian pottery is reserved for another article. The processes of making are noted with some detail. Reinsch (P. S.) The negro race and European civilization. (Amer. J. So- ciol., Chicago, 1905, xI, 145-167.) Dis- cusses race-mixture, type of civilization, social organization, slavery, lack of me- chanical arts ("greatest deficiency of the negro race "), rudimentary art-sense, expertness in oratory with rich folklore, fetishism (intellectual life chiefly taken upwith this). Low stage of culture among African negroes " due rather to social, political and climate cqnditions than to the physiological, personal incapacity of the negro." The "missionary-made" man is not the ideal. An economic foundation for African culture is neces- sary ; in creating this European influence may succeed, but permanent bondage under the whites is the wrong way. Schenk (A.) Note sur dix crianes du Congo Franqais. Tribu des Yeveng; race des Fang. (Bull. Soc. Neuchat. de G6ogr., Neuchitel, 1905, xvI, 296-303. ) Brief description, with measurements, of Io Fang skulls (6 male) from the Yeveng tribe in French Congo, collected by Father Trilles. All are dolichoceph- alic. Torday (E.) and Joyce (T. A.) Notes on the ethnography of the Ba-mbala. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1905, xxxv, 398- 426, 3 pl.) Treats of migrations, re- semblances between the Ba-Mbala (a Bantu people of the Inzia-Kwilu region) and the tribes of Portuguese West Africa, clothing and ornament (red body-paint- ing, scarification at puberty, tattooing simple and rare), food (salt used as money; geophagy and cannibalism com- mon; drunkenness a sign of wealth), fishing and hunting (rather poor shots), crafts (basketry learned from the Ba- Yanzi, pottery made by women, metal- lurgy, house-building, etc.), trade (shell- money, markets, credit-system), social organization (" communism with a strong flavoring of anarchy" ; unit is village community, with chief holding position by wealth; muri, a special class; mar- riage, child and adult), slavery (three- fourths slaves), property (renting of land unknown), education and psychology (children precocious, geographical knowledge and memories good, arith- metic poor), message-arrows, music (no foreign songs sung), justice (= "pala- ver" - round this their whole life centers), war, poison ordeal, death and burial (children before puberty, plants, food, and weapons have no soul), re- ligion (moloki a malevolent being; mapuans, fetishes), reproduction, ab- normalities, language (vocabulary, pages 421-426).

Proverbes, l6gendes et con- tes Fang. (Bull. Soc. NeuchAt. de Geogr., Neuchatel, 1905, xvI, 49-294 pp., 5 pl. ) In this interesting and rather comprehensive monograph Father Tril- les, after an ethnographic introduction, treats of proverbs and sayings (67-III), religious legends and origin-myths (128- 170), nature-myths (170-180), wonder- tales (180-205 - giant and dwarf stories abound), animal-stories (205-246 - the tortoise and elephant cycles), moral tales (247-284). In all, the French texts of 34 legends and tales are given, and at pages 287-294 native texts with interlinear translations of four. The proverb is Fang philosophy, history, morals, religion (e. g., "to live with one's wife's relatives is to become a child again"). Meal-time (6 p. m.) is the story-hour. The tale-tellers are wandering bands and old men. The animal-tales have two cycles, that of the tortoise, typifying the wisdom of the little, and that of the elephant, typi- fying the wisdom of the big. The Fang are a fine African people of Bantu stock, cannibals, but eating only prisoners. Villattes Forschungen in der Sahara. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1906, LXXXIX, 55-57, I fg.) Resumes briefly the ex- plorations of N. Villatte, the scientific member of the Sahara expedition (1904) of Captain Laperinne in the region toward the Niger. At the wells of Timissao was found a grotto with Tama- shek inscriptions and drawings of ani- mals (cattle, camels, ostriches). Wheelwright (C. A.) Native circumci- sion lodges in the Zoutpansberg district. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1905, xxxv, 251-255.) Describes the "lodges" or "schools" (there are three grades of teachers with different functions) as ob- served among the Bavenda in 1904, and the ceremonies in connection therewith. They were originally held in April or May at intervals of five years. Native public opinion drives many to submit to the rites (great secrecy is maintained) and many Christian natives break away from the mission stations to join the "schools," which usually last three months. White (F.) Notes on the great Zimbabwe elliptical ruin. (Ibid., 39-47, 6 pl.) Author gives results (descriptions, meas- urements, etc.) of survey made by him in 1903, compared with the data of Bent and Swan, etc. W's observations throw out altogether the "cubit theory" of Bent and Swan and show how little foundation there is for the view that the 'builders were Semitic (Arabs), and that sun-worship had here reached an ad- vanced stage. The plans of the build- ers, whoever they were, "are quite wanting in symmetry or in evidence of careful design." Willoughby (W. C.) Notes on the to- temism of the Becwana. (Ibid., 295- 314.) Treats of words used to express the totem idea, tribal totems, animal totems (especially crocodile and hare), cattle in Becwana life and customs (ox sacrifice, etc.), purification of warriors, marriage ceremonies, prerogatives of chiefs, children's play, oaths, plant and cereal totems, New Year's purification, etc. W. states that though every Bec- wana tribe has its present-day totem (and every small boy knows what his tribal totem is), yet it is decadent, and these totems have practically no influence upon their great rites and everyday cus- toms. The central place in all the ritual of the greater ceremonies is taken by cattle. The most valuable evidence for plant-totems (veneration of leratse and Kaffir-corn) is to be found in the initia- tion ceremony for girls. ASIA Adachi (B. und Y.) Die Handknochen der Japaner. (Mitt. d. Med. Fac. d. K.-Jap. Univ. zu Tokyo, 1905, vr, 349- 375, 6 pl.) In this eighth contribution to the anatomy of the Japanese, Dr and Mrs A. give the results of their examin- ation of the bones of the hand of 25 adult Japanese (m. 15, w. io) and 10 adult Europeans (m. 4, w. 2, ? 4)- the vari- ous bones are studied in detail, with measurements. The hand-bones of the Japanese are shorter and proportionally thicker than those of Europeans; the articular surfaces are more curved, more extended, more rarely split, etc. (the articular surface is more curved and ex-</page><page sequence="21">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 599 tensive in women); the basal and ter- minal phalanges are relatively long, the metacarpal and the middle phalanx shorter in Japanese hands; the terminal phalanx is slimmer and more pointed. Slimness or thickness of hand and finger bones cannot be explained as being due to work, though the differences in artic- ular surfaces doubtless are. The fine work, however, of the Japanese is more a product of experience than of particular finger-forms. So, too, perhaps the stiff European hand. Japanese children can often press their fingers back to touch the fore-arm. Brockelmann (C.) Ein Tieropfer in der georgischen Kirche. (Arch. f. Religsw., Lpzg., 19O6, vIII, 554-556.) Calls at- tention to the fact that (as noted by the Patriarch Macarius of Antioch in 1671) the sacrifice of animals lasted in the Georgian churches till far on in the sev- teenth century. Butler (H. C.) Preliminary report of the Princeton University expedition to Syria. (Amer. J. Archoeol., Norwood, Mass., 1905, IX, 389-400.) Brief account of in- vestigations of 1904 at Bosra, Si', Umm idj-Djimal, the 'Ala country, il-Andarin (the ancient city of Androna), Kerratin (almost as extensive as il-Andarin), the group of towns in the northern end of the Djebel Bdrishd, etc. Hundreds of in- scriptions were copied, squeezes of archi- tectural details made, also hundreds of photographs. Dhorme (P.) La terre-mare chez les As- syriens. (Arch. f. Religsw., Lpzg., 19o6, VIII, 550-552.)

(Globus, Brnschwg., 19o6, LXXXIX, 21-25, 45-49, I fg.) R6sum6s data concerning the sacred footprints of Buddha in various parts of India (some are not reputed to be old; the famous one of Ceylon is "Ifather " of many). Also detailed description of an ebony plate copy (now in the Liibeck Ethnological Museum) of the footprint according to Siamese symbolic lore (Io8 figures are on it). Littmann (E.) Inscriptions. (Amer. J. Archaeol., Norwood, Mass., 1905, IX, 400-410.) Treats briefly of the in- scriptions collected by the Princeton Uni- versity expedition of 1904 in Syria-- Latin 45, Greek 776, Nabataean 105, Safaitic 1,295, Syriac 65, Arabic 138, Hebrew I. Many of the Latin, Greek, and Nabatoean inscriptions are epitaphal and funerary. The new Safaitic inscrip- tions add much to our knowledge of the life and language of the ancient northern Arabs (new names of deities and tribes occur). Peters (J. P.) The palace at Nippur Babylonian, not Parthian. (Ibid., 450- 452.) Criticizes views of Hilprecht and Marquand. P. considers the palace Par- thian, ca. 1200 B. C. Greek(Mycenoean) influences are apparent in the architecture. Robinson (D. M.) Greek and Latin in- scriptions from Sinope and environs. (Ibid., 294-333.) Reproduces and dis- cusses 79 Greek and Latin inscriptions and 17 others from elsewhere mentioning Sinopeans - about one-half were dis- covered by the author in 1903. These consist of inscriptions on vase-handles, dedications, on sarcophagi, gravestones, etc. The 8 Latin inscriptions are new. Rose (H. A.) Hindu pregnancy obser- vances in the Punjab. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1905, xxxv, 271-278.) Treats of Hindu " rites, some of which appear to be relics of an old custom of re-mar- riage during the first pregnancy " ; strict taboo on first menstruation after mar- riage, observances at mid-pregnancy, the kanjf and dewd-dhatmf of the seventh month, the ceremonies of the eighth month (athwatnsa, matwalf), taboos during eclipses, rites to avoid abortion. - Muhammadan pregnancy observances in the Punjab. (Ibid., 279-232.) Treats of the observances of the seventh month (satwahin, satwans2) and ninth month (naunmast2). In Delhi many elaborate customs (some borrowed from the Hindus) connected with pregnancy survive. Thin milk in the mother's breasts presages a boy. Many food taboos exist.

Describes from specimens in the museum in Florence the tavau, a sort of" money'' of red feathers, in use on the island of Sta Cruz, Melanesia. This "money" is kept wound on two bark rings, the feathers being attached to a body made from strips of pandanus leaves; various ornaments of shell, pieces of mother-of- pearl, etc., are attached. The orna- mented part is 8 mm. long and 57 mm. wide. Haddon (E. B.) The dog-motive in Bornean art. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1905, 113-125, 19 fgs.) Discusses the dog-motive in the tattoo-patterns, bamboo-carvings, etc., of the Bahau- Kenyah-Kayans, etc., of Borneo, and the modifications of it by the Kalamantan, who have absorbed some of their culture. Mr H. thinks this motive originated with the Bahau-Kenyah-Kayans and was carried with them in their migrations - in Sarawak the dog's head appears con- ventionalized as a rosette. Among the Kalamantans the dog-motive is looked upon as a prawn ; by the Ibans of Rejan as a scorpion. Lang (A.) The primitive and the ad- vanced in totemism. (Ibid., 315-336.) Discusses the question whether the Cen- tral and Northern Australian tribes (as Professor Spencer believes), or those of S. E. Australia on the Murray and Dar- ling rivers are "the most primitive (the word does not refer to material progress) in religion and in social organization." L. holds that the totemism of the Central Australian Arunta, contra Spencer, is not at all primitive, but has been modi- fled by the stone amulet and reincarna- tion belief. Lasch (R.)

Mathews (R. H.) Sociology of some Australian tribes. (J. &amp; Proc. R. Soc. N. S. W., Sydney, 19o6, XXXIX, 104- 123.) Treats of the Wombaia of the Northern territory, the Wongaibon on the Lachlan river, Barkunjee of western New South Wales, the first more in detail (subdivisions, marriage-sections, marriage-sequences and progeny-names). Mr M. is of opinion that "neither pro- miscuous intercourse of the sexes, nor . group marriage' have ever ex- isted among the social institutions of the aborigines of Australia." Also "the di- visions into cycles, phratries, and sections have not been. deliberately formulated, with intent to prevent consanguineous marriages and incest, but have been de- veloped in accordance with surrounding circumstances and conditions of life." He criticizes Spencer and Gillen's and Howitt's recognition of "two exoga- mous groups," substituting therefor two principal divisions. Among the Won- gaibon, Barkunjee, etc., "exogamy is entirely absent." Ethnological notes on the aboriginal tribes of Queensland. (Proc. and Trans. Roy. Geogr. Soc.

(J. R. Soc. N. S. W., Sydney, 1904, xxxvIII, 203-381). This article, with some additions, has been reprinted (Syd- ney, 1905, XIV, 183, 4 fgs.). It contains a mass of information concerning socio- logical and marriage institutions, lan- guage, food regulations, sorcery and magic, initiation and other ceremonies, mythology, and folklore (some 20 tales, pages 135-174, 177-183), etc. The bibliography (pages ix-xiv) shows Mr M. to have published 95 different articles relating to the Australian aborigines. The pirrimbir or "avenging expedi- tion " of the natives of S. E. New South Wales is described by the author for the first time (pages 37-50) with some de- tail. At page 103 we learn of the exist- ence among many tribes of "a hybrid tongue or jargon, comprising a short code of words, by means of which a moth- er-in-law can carry on a limited conver- sation in the presence of her son-in-law, respecting some of the events of daily life." Some sections of this monograph, the author expects, "will completely revolutionize all the old school notions respecting the organization of Australian tribes," and, "it will be evident that the old women's yarns about 'marriage by elopement,' 'marriage by capture,' and ' group marriage' are practically im- possible as fundamental matrimonial laws in aboriginal society." Roth (W. E.) Notes on government, morals and crime. (N. Queensld. Eth- nogr. Bull., No. 8, Brisbane, 1906, pp. 12, 4 pl.). Treats of assembly of eld- ers, camp council, rights and powers of individual, sex relations, obscenity (sod- omy, masturbation, bad language) lazi- ness, falsehood, gluttony, respect for old age, treatment of non-tribesmen, saluta- tion (kissing fairly rare; much formal- ity), trespass, inheritance, crimes against the person and against property, prop- erty-marks and "message-sticks," expi- ation. The "message-sticks'" are dis- cussed in detail, with many figures. Dr R. believes that " the marks on the so- called ' message-sticks' do not convey the slightest intimation of any communi- cation." They merely accentuate the bona fides of the messenger. Stephan (Dr) Anthropologische An- gaben iiber die Barriai, Neupommern.

This valua- ble article, with abundant bibliographical references, discusses types, distribution, construction and furnishings, use and methods of propulsion; etc., of the bark canoes, dug-outs, logs and rafts used for navigation by Australian aborigines. In the west and south navigation and even swimming are said to have been un- known. A list of canoe-names is given (73-77). The one-piece bark canoe is probably original in Australia; the sewn- bark type, limited to the northern region, may have been imported; the dug-out of the Blue mountains is probably native ; the out-rigger is of Papuan origin. T. thinks the Tasmanians reached that island by canoes (they resemble the Seri balsas), not by land. AMERICA Bourne (E. G.) The travels of Jonathan Carver. (Amer. Hist. Rev., N.

Prof. B. is of opin- ion that the evidence here presented makes it clear that " the Travels of Jona- than Carver can no longer be ranked as an authentic record of the observations of the supposed author.

Tribal nomen- clature and distribution, organization (chiefdom important), language (brief vocabularies of Tambopata-Guarayo, Arasa, Yamiaca, Atsahuaca, Tuyoneiri - the first two are Tacana, the third and fourth Pano, the last neither Tacana nor Pano), physical characters, war, friend- ly intercourse, migrations and agriculture (fields widely scattered), fishing and hunting (few tame animals), weapons (bow and arrow in detail), houses (each tribe has several dwelling-places in con- nection with its various fields), family (small, monogamous), fire and food- preparation (vegetable food most im- portant ; eat all day), disease and death, etc., (dysentery; clean, daily baths; not cannibals), clothing and ornament (ornaments on cotton shirts few; hunt- ing trophies worn; nose-piercing; neck- laces), dance and song with feather- dress, painting face and body, ham- mocks and basketry, drawings (Yamiaca drawings on clothes, walls, etc., due to more contact with whites), hospitality (marked; no word for "thank you," no handshake, only nodding with head as greeting). N. has found out much that is new about these "wild Chun- chos.'" - Ethnographische und archiaologische Forschungen im Grenzgebiet zwischen Peru und Bolivia, 1904-1905. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 19o6, xxxvIII, 80-99, 20 fgs.) Treats of the Quechua Indians of the borderland between Peru and Bolivia and the results of archeological investi- gations (ckulpas, burial-caves, etc.) on the eastern slopes of the Andes. Among the objects found were bronze needles (to- pos) with llama-heads or leaf heads, such as are still used by Quechua women, pes- tles, pottery fragments - sometimes quite modern objects (later additions to orig- inal votive gifts). In one burial cave were 200 skeletons, in one chulpa 16; few had but one. Certain old Quechua customs (dances, burial of property with dead, foundation-sacrifice, "magic " for dry weather, making-sick, etc. ) are no- ticed. The "wild" Indians or Chun- chos are briefly considered. Palmer (T. C.) Indian implements col- lected on the river shore at Chester, 1893 to 1897. (Proc. Del. Co. Inst. Sci., Media, Pa., 19o6, I, no. 2, 26-28, I fg.) Describes briefly a collection of arrow heads ( io in number), " reject " clippings and flakes, pottery fragments, piece of slate gorget, scraper, hammer, axes, etc., presented by the author to the museum of the Society. A large num- ber of the arrow-heads are of the " white flint" so common along the Delaware. In the angle between the river and La- mokin run once stood an Indian village. Seler (E.) Das Dorfbuch von Santiago Guevea. Eine zapotekische Handschrift aus der Mitte des sechzehnten Jahr- hunderts. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1906, xxxvuII, 121-155, 36 fgs.) Describes and discusses (hieroglyphics, names, numbers, words, etc.) a Zapotec Ms. of 1540 (from two copies, one at Guevea, one in the Mexican National Museum). Three languages appear, Aztec, Zapotec, Spanish. The upper half of the leaf contains the hieroglyphics of the place and those of 19 points around it; the lower pictures of the people presenting tribute to the kings. Sergi (G.) Contributo all' antropologia Americana. (A.. d. Soc. Rom. di. An- throp., 1906, xII, 197-204, I PI.) Treats of three American types of crania : Ancient Peruvian, which has negroid or oceanic pigmoid elements (cranial form, capacity, stature) due to trans-Pacific im- migrants - this skull is Sphenoides par- vus peruvianus; modern Bolivian In- dian (Ovoides bolivianus), with Melan- esian affinities; mound-builder skull with central Asiatic relations. Prof. S. sees two pre-Columbian currents of im- migration into America, one Oceanic, the other Asiatic. Simmons (H. G.) Eskimdernas forna och nutida utbredning samt deras van- dringsviigar. (Ymer, Stockholm, 1905, xxv, 173-192, map, 6 fgs.) Discusses former and present distribution and mi- grations of the Eskimo tribes, with refer- ences to recent authorities, particularly Boas and Thalbitzen- the map is modi- fied from that of the latter (it shows regions now uninhabited by Eskimo but containing evidences of their former resi- dence: Southeast coast of Labrador, east coast of Greenland, the Arctic archi- pelago between Greenland, Baffin Land and Victoria Land, and a portion of the extreme N. E. Asiatic coast). One of the notable Eskimo " ruins" is "Eski- mopolis" on Buchanan Strait, visited by the author in 1899.

I.) Recent archeological dis- coveries in northwestern America. (Bull. Amer. Geogr. Soc., N. Y., Igo6, xxxvIII, repr. pp. I-9.) Summarizes briefly explorations (1897-99, 1903) of village sites and graves in the southern interior of British Columbia and the in- terior of Washington; shell-heaps and cairns on the coast of British Columbia and Washington; sites along the Co- lumbia river, between Portland and the coast. Mr S. found that the interior S. British Columbia culture was a unit, that of the coast another unit, while in central Washington was a culture dif- fering in some respects from both. The Lillooet valley shows influences of both coast and interior. The material culture of the prehistoric people resembled that of the Indians of to-day ; inter-tribal in- terference was greater in earlier times. West (G. A.) The aboriginal pipes of Wisconsin. (Wisc. Archeol., Madison, 1905, IV, 47-17I, 17 pl., 205 fgs.) This valuable and exhaustive monograph treats of tomahawk pipes (author be- lieves that "most of the metal artifacts found in Wisconsin, commonly attributed to French origin, were really made by the British and Dutch "), other metallic pipes, clay and pottery trade pipes, pot- tery pipes (native pipes comparatively few, pot-making more developed here), stone pipes, Siouan pipes (calumets), "Micmac" pipes, portrait pipes (stone pipes with carved human heads most common form of effigy pipe in W.), effigy and emblematic pipes (compara- tively few), "bridegroom" or double- stemmed pipes (one bowl with two stem- holes), "flatform" or "monitor" pipes (nearly all surface finds) of various types, handled pipes (22 examples,tno two of same pattern), disk pipes of three varie- ties, high-bowled, pot-shaped, vase- shaped, square-bowled, ovoid, lens- shaped, keel-shaped, double conoidal pipes, pebble pipes ("rudest pipe form imaginable'' ), tube pipes, peculiar tubes, California tube pipes, etc. A number of the Wisconsin pipes are evidently exotics (due to barter, trade, conquest). "In- dian tobacco" of several sorts (kinnikin- nik, etc.) was used by the aborigines of Wisconsin, but "tobacco, as we now know it, was introduced by the whites."</page></plain_text>
