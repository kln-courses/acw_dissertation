Hirschman ABSTRACT: Cross-cultural research on advertising has called attention to the important role that core societal values have on advertising production and reception. This study focuses on a core American cultural value, rugged individualism. Drawing on recent scholarship that emphasizes the rhetorical, mythical, and metaphorical bases of advertising imagery, the inquiry identifies seven bipolar tensions underlying the expression of rugged individualism in contemporary print advertisements. Although Americans commonly are viewed as the most highly individualized of all populations (Bellah et al. 1985; Inkeles 1983; Tocqueville 1835), and many acts of consumption in the United States are directed toward establishing individual- ity, this core cultural value has received relatively little atten- tion in the advertising literature. My present purpose is to investigate the semiotic frameworks and tensions underlying one form of individualism-rugged individualism-that is especially significant in the American psyche. In so doing, this inquiry seeks to further two recent strands of research on advertising's role in creating and being created by the sociocultural context in which it occurs. The first is the increasing attention researchers are paying to cross- cultural value differences and the impact this may have on advertising content and effectiveness. As markets expand into globalized structures, advertisers increasingly must gain an accurate grasp of how a given culture, or subculture, will re- spond to the rhetoric, symbols, and images incorporated into specific advertisements (Al-Olayan and Karande 2000; Biswas, Olsen, and Carlet 1992; Cheng and Schweitzer 1996; Donthu 1998). Attitudes toward individualism versus collectivism as a primary cultural value have emerged as a key construct that differentiates not only countries, but also their advertising (e.g., Hong, Muderrisogler, and Zinkhan 1987; Lin 2001; Mueller 1987). The second research avenue pursued herein is the grow- ing interest in viewing advertisements as carriers of mythic, rhetorical, symbolic, and metaphoric content (Coulter, Zaltman, and Coulter 2001;Johar, Holbrook, and Stern 2001; Randazzo 1995; Stern 1988). Not only are cultural values cited in advertising copy, they also are often coded in the visual imagery, colors, movements, music, and other nonverbal ele- ments of an advertisement (Scott 1994). Thus, to identify them, research must delve into the semiotic structures in par- ticular advertisements and not merely enumerate words and phrases. Individualism In recent philosophy, individualism has received ample atten- tion because of its preeminence as a democratic ideal (e.g., Birnbaum and Leca 1990). The late French intellectual Michel Foucault, for example, distinguished among three aspects of the term: (1) The individualistic attitude, characterized by the absolute value attributed to the individual ... by the degree of independence conceded to him.... (2) The positive valuation of private life.... (3) The intensity of the relations to self, that is, of the forms in which one is called upon to take oneself as an object of knowledge and a field of action. (1986, p. 42) Somewhat akin to Foucault's third aspect of individualism is Reisman, Glazer, and Denney's (1961) definition of the inner-directed person, who sees his or her field of action as one defined by impersonal (e.g., contractual) relationships and self-serving behaviors. Tocqueville (1835/1985, pp. 104-105) cast individualism more positively when he observed that Americans "owe nothing to any man; they expect nothing from any man; they acquire the habit of always considering themselves as standing alone, and are apt to imagine that their whole destiny is in their own hands." More recently, social psychologist Harry Triandis, who has spent his career analyzing the psychologies of individualism and collectivism (e.g., 1972, 1977, 1989), defines individual- ism as "a social pattern that consists of loosely linked indi- viduals who view themselves as independent of collectives; Elizabeth C.

Empirical studies on individualism have been conducted in several cross-cultural contexts by anthropological research- ers as well (e.g., Kluckhohn 1956; Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck 1961; Mead 1967). Their findings suggest individualistic cul- tures emphasize self-sufficiency, self-glorification, personal efficacy, and the necessity of personal struggle/achievement (see also Triandis 1995). Among social scientists examining American culture, in early work Parsons (1949) distinguished between collective and self goals, whereas Lukes (1973) viewed individualism as a complex, multifaceted concept that emphasized human dig- nity, the right to selfhood, the right to privacy, and the free- dom to fully develop potential, unimpeded by societal barri- ers such as poverty and racial discrimination. Bellah and colleagues (1985) were more equivocal in their assessment of individualism in U.S. society. Its disadvantages included the potential for the reckless pursuit of hedonism, loneliness, and disconnectedness. However, individualism's benefits were cited as highly potent as well, and included freedom, equity, merit-based social rank, self-sufficiency, and fair competition (Bellah et al. 1985). Political scientists since Tocqueville have traced the ebb and flow of individualism as a core value in the U.S. political system (e.g., Bailint 1968; Bernstein 1968). In The Politics of Individualism, Lawrence Kohl (1989) examines the inherent distrust that rural, agricultural citizens had for their urban, business-banking counterparts during the 1800s. A social class and rural/urban rift developed during this time in American history, which still inhibits authentic individualism as a demo- cratic ideal. The rural, and later blue collar, citizenry viewed the central government as inherently corrupted by the self- seeking greed of the upper, urban classes. Individual free- dom, in the rural and working class view, was to be found in rebellion against centralized authority. As Kohl (1989, p. 46) writes, "The truly independent man was the one who stood apart from the banks and corporations. The only free man was, by definition, the outsider." The Democratic Review (quoted in Kohl 1989, p. 105) declared, "the great object of govern- ment is to secure every man in the enjoyment of his rights. Beyond this, it should not meddle with the affairs of men." The Ethos of Rugged Individualism The term "rugged individualism" was popularized by anthro- pologist Francis L.K. Hsu (1988), who drew on a detailed ethnographic study of Chinese, Japanese, and U.S. cultures. Building on the work of Kluckhohn (1956), Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck (1961), Mead (1967), and Triandis (1989), Hsu (1988) identified an especially potent form of individualism that he believed had propelled both the most admirable and the most troublesome aspects of U.S. society since its incep- tion in the 1700s. Hsu (1988) noted that whereas Chinese culture in particu- lar was built on a prescribed series of widely accepted domi- nance/subordinance relations, American society was built on an ethos of self-reliance with competition. This meant that each person strove to meet his or her needs, wants, and de- sires through personal effort in a way that outperformed his or her peers. To Hsu (1988), such rugged individualism was the source of both the creativity and the chaos that characterized American culture. Entrepreneurism, exploration, and dis- covery require aggressive creativity that is willing to bend or break rules, trample on accepted boundaries, and discard traditional rules of conduct. But as Hsu (1988) notes, such unfettered freedom to "do it my way" leads also to crime, violence, and other forms of selfish aggression. Hsu (1988) notes that "To succeed, the rugged individualist is driven to treat all other human beings as things to be manipulated, coerced or eliminated, if they happen to get in the way of his forward march" (p. x) and that "The rugged individual is bound to be self-centered. He is taught to shape the world in his image" (p. xi). It is this virulent or prepotent form of individualism that is the focus of the present inquiry. My task is to identify some of the semiotic structures, both visual and verbal (e.g., McQuarrie and Mick 1999; Scott 1994; Stern 1989), that char- acterize and communicate the ethos of rugged individualism to consumers. METHOD A year's series (i.e., twelve issues) of nine magazines that seemed a priori to be directed toward persons adhering to the rugged individualism ethos was collected and subjected to textual analysis through close reading (see Scott 1994; Stern 1989). These magazines included Hunting, Bow Hunting World, Rzfleshooter, Guns andAmmo, Field &amp; Stream, Coonhound, Stockcar Racing, NASCAR Illustrated, and 4-Wheel &amp; Off Road. The publications chosen should be appropriate for an initial map- ping of the themes, icons, and rhetoric underlying rugged individualism. As interest in this construct grows, additional media vehicles (e.g., television programming, motion pictures) and behavioral sites (e.g, athletic events) may be identified and subjected to analysis. For each magazine, a year's subscription was initiated, and each issue was read and annotated page by page. This pro- vided a cross-sectional view of the data set each month, as well as a chronological perspective over the year's course.

At the outset of the analysis, only loose categories of meaning were perceived and noted (e.g., trophy, winning, competition); these were successively refined and focused as the months pro- gressed. At the close of the year, the entire data set was re- read and grouped into seven bipolar pairings or tensions that seemed to represent the ideology communicated. These ten- sions are summarized in Table 1. Although the focus of the present analysis is on the ad- vertising content of the data set, the editorial content also is vital to understanding the ethos of rugged individualism and the advertisements themselves, because it both frames and reinforces the advertising text (Hirschman and Thompson 1997). Readers enter a given magazine with expectations shaped by the cover images and prior editorial and advertis- ing content they have encountered in previous issues. Adver- tisements are given meaning by (and concurrently provide meaning to) the textual material in which they are embedded, whether the medium is magazines, newspapers, television, radio, or an Internet site. Analysis and Findings Competition Against Oneself/Competition Against Others. Rugged individualism sees both the self and others as foes to be over- come. Flowing from Nietzschean proposals (Nietzsche 1882- 1888/1968), the "will to power" implies that the will or mind must overcome the weaknesses and inadequacies of the physi- cal body. The rugged individualist does not succumb to fear, hunger, cold, pain, self-doubt, or moral uncertainty. The rug- ged individualist anticipates these internal foes and is mentally prepared to overcome them. Figure 1 (Remington Country) is an advertisement for Remington rifles. Set in Lolo, MT, it depicts a lone cowboy- hatted figure on horseback leading a packhorse, across which an elk with large antlers is slung. The headline reads: "Break- fast: desire; Lunch: persistence; Dinner: commitment." The cowboy is riding downhill from his trip up the mountain (i.e., from wilderness/nature). The semiotics of the advertisement indicate he has successfully hunted and killed a large stag. Through its visual rhetoric of man and horse, solitude, and nature, the ad suggests the protagonist is returning with his trophy, his meat provisions, and his selfhood gained. The body copy is printed to look handwritten. It emphasizes Reming- ton's "devastating knockdown power," "strong and solid" per- formance, and "dead-on accuracy" for "wide-open, Western hunting." In this case, the protagonist has faced the chal- lenges of nature and returned victorious. However, on occasion, nature can prove a formidable op- ponent and threaten the ability even to survive. Robb (2000, p. 58), writing in Bowhunting World, recounts an emergency situation that he survived and offers mental, emotional, and tactical advice to others: The day I fell off a cliff and broke my leg on a solo backpack hunt for Alaskan Dall sheep was the day my survival skills were tested to their limit.... One of the most important things in a survival situation is being mentally tough enough to handle the stress and deal with problems with a calm mind and or- dered approach.... Remain calm, move deliberately, stay dis-</page><page sequence="4">12 The Journal ofAdvertising FIGURE 1 Remington Country .......... ....... . . . . .... ..i . .: .- .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Remington Arms Company, Inc, Madison, NC ciplined and don't panic. If you're carrying the right survival gear and took the time to learn how to use it, you know deep down inside you'll be fine. Underlying this advice is a core tenet of rugged individu- alism: A person must be capable of complete self-sufficiency; being unprepared or depending on help from others can re- sult in failure and/or death. The advertisement for Warn Winches in Figure 2 depicts just such a situation. Two hunters find themselves in a driv- ing rain; their truck has slid off the muddy road and dangles precariously near an embankment. Only by using the winch to pull the car back up to the road can they remedy this emer- ito get into trouble, Warn makes a way to get out." The rheto- son can learn more effective strategies through adversity FIGURE 2 Warn Winches than from continuous success, according to the thinking. A true champion is not one who has never lost, but rather one who lost, learned to become a stronger competitor, re- turned to the competition, and triumphed. Mace Taxco (2000), a reader of Stock Car Racing, writes regarding his fa- vorite driver, Jeff Gordon, and Gordon's recent history of losing races: Like the proverbial Phoenix arising from the ashes, Jeff Gor- don will win again, but we must be patient and supportive of him.... Rocky Marciano may have been the only boxing cham- pion to go through a long and illustrious career without ever experiencing defeat or loss. Yet when people talk about "the greatest," names like Ali, Louis, and Robinson always seem to be the ones mentioned and all of them tasted defeat and "downtime." Jeff Gordon's "downtime" will help define him and make him more than what his victories ever could. We must look at it as a good thing ... something that will make J.G. better in the end and complete him. The ethos of rugged individualism lauds coming back from defeat, but its ideal is ruthless competition; following Nietzsche (1888/1967), pitting top competitors against each other to de- termine dominance is the ultimate goal. Entrants in such trials must challenge themselves not only to achieve their personal best, but also to demonstrate superiority over others. For example, an article in Guns and Ammo, recommends</page><page sequence="5">Spring 2003 13 the British Special Air Service as a superb training ground for tactical forces: The Special Air Service, Britain's elite commando unit, is in- viting members of Germany's best-Grenzschutzgruppe 9, or GSG-9 and Kommandos Spezialkrafte, or KSK--to spend up to two years with the SAS.... SAS training is considered one of the toughest regimens in the world, maybe the tough- est, so failing is not unusual for anyone not in top physical condition. Even then, only the cream of that crop will gradu- ate. ("Newsbreak" 2001, p. 43) To compete against such opponents, rugged individual- ism advocates risk-taking, courage, and creativity. The fol- lowing description of race car driver Troy Kuyoth from Stock Car Racing illustrates this ideology: On the track he shows no fear whatsoever; in fact, regardless of the track conditions, he's one of the hardest charging driv- ers you will ever see. He will drive his car deeper into the turn when he needs to and test new lines to get through traffic when everyone else is content to play follow-the-leader. Troy Kuyoth is relentless. ("Home Grown" 2000, p. 24) Manual Labor Versus Purchased Labor: Make or Buy A revealing tension in the rugged individualism ethos exists between the choice to make or purchase the equipment re- quired for competition. Although some might argue that the "head work" required to obtain purchase money is as chal- lenging as the "hand work" required to construct the neces- sary equipment, a clear bias exists in the texts examined. Be- cause of the emphasis on self-sufficiency, making equipment was deemed a more honorable and authentic badge of rug- ged individualism than was purchasing it. This seems to spring from the core notion of self-reliance: A rugged individualist should be able to construct all that is needed for survival; dependence on others to provide equipment, materials, or resources betrays a weakness of character and capability. An article in Stock Car Racing describes driver Bob Keselowski as just such a self-made competitor: You've seen it many times. Attractive but talentless racers, money oozing from their wallets, burst on the racing scene.... They employ clever public relations whiz kids who pen flow- ery bios to accompany a short resume that lists a few Quarter Midget starts to go along with some snippets concerning a technical prowess akin to knowing which shaft the steering wheel attaches to.... On the other hand, there are still competitors who gained a foothold by racing their way in. Even fewer design and con- struct the cars and/or trucks they drive.... Bob Keselowski is one of those very few. He listened and learned and can now blueprint and assemble a chassis from the ground up, has taken those cars to wins in touring championships, and has a trophy case full of hardware to prove the point. (Schwarze 2000, pp. 32-33) This same magazine carries a monthly feature called "Home Grown" in which readers' self-constructed cars and race records are praised. An example follows: More than 20 years ago Tommy Pennington and his dad, Eddie, built Tommy's first race car. It wasn't the best or the prettiest, but it was theirs. Unfortunately, his dad passed away, and though Tommy felt lost without him, he kept racing. He moved his way through Four Cylinder racing to Street Stocks, then Semi-Lates and now he owns and drives a Late Model. In 13 years running, he has not missed a night at West Virginia's Elkins Speedway. He's grabbed three point titles, despite a small budget. His drive and determination continue to be in- spired. ("Home Grown" 2000, p. 24) Typically, in texts extolling rugged individualism, emphasis is placed on learning from trial and error, overcoming hard- ship, and perseverance, each important aspects of rugged individualism. Analogously, constructing a weapon that per- forms successfully can provide a deeper sense of accom- plishment than undertaking the same activity with purchased equipment. In addition to the emotional rewards of con- structing something and using it to compete successfully, rugged individualist texts propose that essential personal experience is gained. That is, knowledge of how an object works is acquired, which would not be accessible if the same item was purchased. Quinnell (2000b, p. 7) writes in 4-Wheel &amp; Off Road: Most of us started by taking a stock 4'4 out onto easy trails and worked up to harder trails until we got spanked. Then we'd figure out what modifications we needed, save our pay- checks from McDonald's, buy the parts we needed, conquer the trails that had spanked us, and then search out harder trails that required even taller tires, steeper gears and more horsepower....There was a progression to our four-wheel- ing based on experience.... And along the way we learned lots about our equipment, how to fix it in the field if neces- sary, and how to drive our way through some scary situations. [Conversely] There's a group of four-wheelers emerging that I call either Visa or MasterCard. If you have $45,000 you can buy a Sniper or a Scorpion, or buy a brand-newJeep Wran- gler with an automatic transmission and take it to a 4 x 4 shop. Have the shop install Dana 60s with lockers and 5.13 gears, a winch, a 3-inch body lift, a short-shaft kit on the 231, and 36- inch tires and your Jeep is ready for the hardest trails in the country. I don't dislike these people because they can afford all the best stuff, but I think there's wisdom in improving your vehicle yourself and choosing more difficult trails as your experience grows. Solo Peformance Versus Teamwork Another basic notion of rugged individualism is the desir- ability of solo performance. Tasks should be accomplished alone, dangers met alone, and victory earned alone. In the texts examined, the solitary triumph was the most lauded;</page><page sequence="6">14 The Journal ofAdvertising the purest victories were solo missions. Yet there are some tasks that require teamwork; car racing, especially at profes- sional competition levels (e.g., NASCAR, CART), requires a team of specialists to keep the driver's primary equipment, the car, in serviceable condition. Thus, whereas the heroic status of the drivers (e.g., Dale Earnhardt, Dale Jarrett, Rusty Wallace) is recognized and celebrated, the essential role played by their automotive crew is commended as well. The crew is metaphorically equivalent to the prizefighter's "corner men," giving advice and providing water, ego support, and medical care before pushing the boxer/driver back into the ring. An article taken from Stock CarRacing exemplifies this solo performance versus teamwork tension (Martin 2000a). The article observes that though racer Bobby LaBonte does not win every race he enters, he is consistently near the top. The consistent excellence of his effort is what distinguishes him from the other competitors who may be strong in one race, only to perform weakly in another. Rugged individualism is marked by outstanding effort every time a person is chal- lenged to compete, not just an occasional victory. As Martin (2000a, p. 24) notes, Labonte perfectly emulates the consistent driver in NASCAR.... "I guess it's just a 'work in progress' pattern," Labonte said. "We've worked hard at it.... Each year things have just kind of slowly, meticulously been a little bit better and a little bit better...." Perhaps the signature victory of Labonte's season came when he won the Brickyard 400 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. For 70 laps he kept his Pontiac on the rear bumper of Rusty Wallace's Ford Taurus. With 14 laps to go, Labonte found the right opportunity to get past the car that had led the most laps in the race. He methodically began to set up Wallace in the third turn, pulled alongside the Ford coming off the fourth turn, made a slight bump, and was able to drag-race with Wallace down ... the most fabled race course in the world. At the end of the frontstretch, Labonte pulled in front and was able to drive to the biggest victory of his career. Labonte's use of the pronoun "we" in the first paragraph signifies his recognition of his crew's excellent technological performance. In the philosophy of rugged individualism, how- ever, though pit crews and advanced technology are acknowl- edged as necessary aspects of competition, they also detract from the purity of the victory. There is nostalgia for the "good old days" when race car drivers built and drove their own ma- chines or when one person could "do it all" to achieve success. Hunting is another competitive context in which the ten- sion between solo performance and teamwork is found. Weiss (2000, p. 12) is an advocate of going it alone, arguing that the companionship found in hunting with a friend detracts from the goal of the hunt, which is shooting prey: The average deer hunter's success rate nationwide hovers around 20 percent; only one of every five deer hunters will take home either a buck or doe. Despite these dismal statis- tics, in the last 15 years my deer hunting success rate has averaged about 80 percent. I don't intend to brag, but to make a simple point. Although I still have a tremendous amount to learn about deer hunting, I've nevertheless managed to beat the nationwide average four-fold, and I credit much of that success to the fact that I spend the majority of my time hunt- ing solo. Hunting alone does not necessarily mean shouldering a backpack and penetrating deep wilderness for days on end. It merely means not compromising your own hunting because of the needs, wants, whims or eccentricities of others. Even if you customarily hunt with only one partner who may be just as serious as you are, his very presence is likely to keep you in the lowly 20 percent success category. The reason is because you'll have to make many concessions to accommo- date his work schedule, vacation time, preferences for meal- time, favored hunting techniques, and how much he can afford to spend on travel, licenses and perhaps equipment. Addition- ally, when hunting with others, a substantial degree of social interaction is required. There's verbal planning, and the in- evitable small talk that may have nothing to do with hunting, thus detracting from what should be your main emphasis. On occasion, rugged individualism may intermingle with teamwork. In the following excerpt, taken from Field &amp; Stream, a hunter describes the birth of his hunting camp. A "trial by snow," it provided the participants with a sense of overcom- ing hard challenges and sharing mutual triumph (Martin 2000, p. 86): Hunting isn't just a location-it's a history. Ours began when we bought land at a timber-company auction.... We were de- termined to hunt our new land that year. However, we weren't prepared for what met us there; two feet of snow covered the access road ... but by sundown the next night we had made our first improvements. First, we built a blazing fire and placed some stumps around it so we could sit and warm our frozen bodies. Next, we felled a thin, straight beech and lashed it hori- zontally between two maples. From it we hung the first deer we had taken from the land-a small forkhorn that my brother had killed early that morning. We sat around the fire eating grilled liver and watching the buck slowly swing in the hard wind. "Oh boy, oh boy," said my brother, "this is the most beautiful place in the world." We named it Camp OH BOY. A final example of blended solo performance and team- work is the connection shared between hunter and dog. This colleagueship likely evolved over an extensive history in which human and dog each provided necessary skills to ensure the success of the hunt. Figure 3, an advertisement for Winches- ter rifles, shows a man dressed in camouflage carrying his rifle over one shoulder and a slain Canada goose in the other hand. Next to him is a yellow Labrador Retriever wearing a red ban- dana. As they cross the muddy field side by side, we sense their accomplishment: As a team, they have hunted and succeeded. Technology and Machines Versus Aesthetics and Fashion Rugged individualism values functionality and performance. It is a worldview focused on utility, in that objects (and people)</page><page sequence="7">Spring 2003 15 FIGURE 3 Winchester Rifles "A gun is a tool. ::i -i- i~: i: : iii -i:------------::: Power tools for a new century. k y: HK, Inc. are valued to the extent they can get the job done. Subsequent discussions will address directly the idea of instrumentality it- self. In this section, however, I examine texts that present tech- nology and machines with the aim of evaluating their utility in achieving goals. The normative opposition to this valuation is the inclusion of stylistic or aesthetic components that do not improve or may even detract from its performance. Figure 4 depicts a camouflage laptop computer that dis- plays an image of a topographical digital map. The advertise- ment is promoting software technology that produces highly detailed terrain images useful for planning hunting trips. The camouflage print is used rhetorically here not as a fashion or design device, but rather to signal utility and functionality. It suggests that using the mapping software transforms a com- puter into a weapon with which to track prey. Analogously, the ad in Figure 5 states, "a truly modern utilitarian firearm gives shooters the power to use and control advanced technology." Conversely, poorly performing equipment is subjected to ridicule, as are poorly performing people. The editors of 4- Wheel &amp; Off Road magazine include a regular feature titied "Monster Turds," in which they criticize bad technology. Some excerpts read (Cappa and Hazel 2000, p. 124): FIGURE 4 Maptech ...........

Vacuum Blows We can't understand why any manufacturer would use engine vacuum to control things on the vehicle. We have seen vacuum-operated windows, windshield wipers, and other in- sane gadgetry. The worst are the more recent front-axle dis- connects found in Dodges and Jeeps and vacuum-operated hubs on the new Fords. Ford FE Engines While we often refer to Toyota engines as a squirrel on a treadmill, Ford FEs are the equivalent of an elephant on a Stairmaster. Wheezing, choking, laden with fat in the form of a 75-pound intake manifold and garbage heads, and bur- dened with an overall poor design. Sure, you can build one, but you can also build a Yugo. We ain't doing either. In the ethos of rugged individualism, beauty and comfort are regarded with skepticism bordering on disgust. They are deemed superfluous, inefficient, and useless and, even more forbidding, may seduce the protagonist into abandoning a single-minded commitment to competition. Beauty and com- fort are likened to beckoning sirens that call to hunters, rac- ers, fighters, and runners and divert their attention from reaching excellence in performance. They are trivial, whereas</page><page sequence="8">16 The Journal ofAdvertising FIGURE 5 Warn Headlights 1115 v. functionality is paramount. A headline for Warn headlights in Figure 5, which reads "Introducing Warn High-Efficiency Lighting. Out Here Is No Place for Fashion Statements," puts it plainly: Concern for an object's styling may imperil judg- ment regarding the object's utility. In short, headlights are for looking with, not for looking at. The rugged individualist seeks equipment that is or at least appears to be rugged, solid, and dependable, just as he or she is. Perrone (2000, p. 109) in 4-Wheel &amp; Off-Road, acknowl- edges his affection for a tough appearance: For some reason we just drool all over ourselves when we see a '67-'72 Chevy pickup or Blazer. Something about the raw lines ... just scream that it is a truck. They evoke the days when trucks were actually trucks and had the aerodynamics of a barn door, got the gas mileage of a tank, and had the drivetrain of a semi-truck. They erase from our minds the modern day phrases "car-like handling," "a lower step-in height," and "quietest interior ever." Similarly, Rob Reaser (2001, p. 20) of Hunting magazine writes: I have to admit a slight bias when it comes to 4 x 4s. As an outdoorsman, I prefer trucks and SUVs with a "ragged edge." Fancy gadgets, veneer trim and other niceties sit at the bot- tom of my desirable options list. It's kind of like guns. Deco- rative engraving may be impressive at the range or on the mantle, but when the boots meet the brush, I want a firearm I'm not afraid to scratch, drop or get soaked. Instrumentalism Versus Anthropomorphism As discussed, instrumentalism, or agency (Bakan 1966) as it is sometimes termed, positions the protagonist to view the ob- jects and entities in the world as tools for carrying out the protagonist's objectives. When their utility has been erased or depleted, they may be discarded or abandoned without regret. In examining the texts under consideration, I came to rec- ognize an underlying basis for instrumentalism among rug- ged individualists. It lies in their tendency to anthropomor- phize and empathize with certain entities in the environment but withhold such responses for other entities. The rule I discerned was that objects and beings (e.g., dogs) directly con- nected to the identity of the protagonist were treated in an empathic and anthropomorphic fashion. Conversely, those objects and beings (e.g., deer) on which the individual was acting were not treated with empathy or viewed in an anthro- pomorphic fashion. Rather, they were viewed in tactical terms as targets, trophies, prey, goals, or objectives. An example of this mindset is provided in Deer &amp; Deer Hunting by Hampton (2000, p. 45): When I hunt deer, I know what a "taker" buck looks like ... I don't want to shoot a buck with the antler characteristics of a yearling or 21/2-year-old deer. In other words, a rack of thin antlers, short points or narrow spread. Bucks that can be de- scribed with those terms are best left to grow another year or two until they reach maturity. Here the (male) deer's antlers represent an instrumentalized trophy; smaller trophies are to be rejected in favor of larger ones. Younger or weaker deer are to be avoided, and older, stronger male deer should be targeted. Another article in the same magazine series (Cornell 2000, p. 58) expresses concern that the preference for taking large trophies now may reduce the chances of doing so in the fu- ture, in that "large racked" deer are removed from the target population: Selectively harvesting the biggest bucks of an age class ... leaves the bulk of the breeding in subsequent years to that age class's smaller-racked bucks. Is this practice causing a genetic shift in antler potential that runs counter to herd- management goals? Genetics is, at best, a minor consider- ation of quality deer management (QDM) as practiced to- day. However, I think it will soon be necessary to give it greater consideration, if we're to maintain genes for large antlers in managed white-tailed deer herds. To ensure the presence of trophy-size targets, some states are requiring hunters to shoot "antlerless deer" (i.e., females)</page><page sequence="9">Spring 2003 17 to earn the privilege of shooting a trophy animal the follow- ing season (McCoy 2000, p. 82): Call it an investment in the future. While New Jersey's bowhunters may not be thrilled with a rule that forces them to kill a doe before they can bag a buck, in the long run, they'll probably be happy they complied. "It's really another way to achieve a quality deer management result," says Dan Ferrigno, deer biologist for the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wild- life, "It's about reducing the overall deer population by killing more antlerless deer, while achieving an older age structure among antlered deer-which, of course, results in better qual- ity bucks for our hunters...." NewJersey's controversial "earn- a-buck" regulation may ultimately pay off in what every deer hunter dreams of: an abundance of heavily antlered bucks. Whereas antlered animals such as deer, elk, and moose are viewed as trophies, others are deemed vermin, pests, and irri- tants. Because no anthropomorphic traits are projected on these animals and no empathy extended to them, such "undesirable" species are seen as targets to be eliminated actively. An article by Pearce (2000, p. 106) illustrates this point of view: It is finally springtime, and the ground squirrels are busy dig- ging new holes in Idaho's green grasslands. I took out my three younger boys, ages four, six and eight, to try their new Chipmunk .22 rifles and to help thin out the hole-digging pests.... After the boys had burned several boxes of ammo, I decided it was my turn to take a few shots with my well-worn six-gun. I found a comfortable backrest just 45 yards from a mound, waited a couple minutes, and soon the little devils began popping out of their holes. I took careful aim, cen- tered on the biggest one's midsection and carefully squeezed the trigger. My hold was correct, and the hollowpoint made a distinct ker-plunk as it hit home. Perhaps the most vivid examples of the link between in- strumentality and nonanthropomorphism were found in the descriptions of weapon efficacy in killing target animals. The utility of the weapon is judged by the efficiency and effec- tiveness with which it dispatches the target. This excerpt is from Rifle Shooter (Boddington 2000b, p. 60): The bull was quartering strongly toward me, almost a frontal shot. I raised the Krieghoff double, grateful for its low-power scope, and placed the crosshairs under his nose and just in- side the on-side shoulder. Despite the fading light and the recoil, ... I was aware of the bull rocking back and almost falling, then gathering himself, springing forward and turn- ing to his left. By then I was gathered, too, and I fired the second barrel into his broad flank as he turned away. I wasn't set well for that second shot, and my recovery time was a split-second slower. This time, as I brought the rifle down to reload, all I saw across the knee-high grass was four very large feet thrusting up into the air. I was shocked. I knew I hadn't hit the spine.... Failing a spinal hit, buffalo-whether Afri- can buffalo or these larger water buffalo-do not normally drop so quickly from even the best chest-cavity shot. In contrast to the instrumentalism displayed toward tar- gets and trophies by the rugged individualist, other persons may anthropomorphize and extend empathy toward animals such as deer, raccoons, rabbits, squirrels, and birds. Hunters recognize this tendency, and many condemn it as misplaced sentimentality or even antihuman bias. A writer for Hunting magazine, Brian McCombie (2000, p. 71), comments angrily on the antihunting sentiments he encountered at his children's elementary school: In 1998, Bob Mills (name changed for reasons made clear below) attended an open house at a local elementary school. While in the library, Mills thumbed through some books set aside for second and third graders. The illustrations in one book caught his attention. A family of rabbits was sitting at a table eating dinner. They used silverware and wore clothes. "It was like suppertime in Leave It to Beaver," Mills remem- bers. "Only with rabbits instead of people." Enter the HUNTER. "Big, fat, ugly, unshaven," accord- ing to Mills. All the animals hide in cowering fear, causing the hunter to leave. That night, the animals trash his tent and smash his gun to bits, forcing the hunter to return home. "The last page shows all the animals holding hands and danc- ing around in a circle, celebrating," Mills says. Today, animal rightists are working their way into our elementary schools, as well as our colleges and universities. The goal is to edu- cate the young with pro-animal and ultimately anti-people messages. Rugged individualists are not immune to empathy and anthropomorphism, but it is directed toward a more circum- scribed set of recipients. In particular, the texts examined suggested that objects and animals identified with the self were very consistently anthropomorphized by these individu- alists. The following sections provide some examples. Cars, Vehicles, andAutomotive Equipment. One of the most com- monly anthropomorphized types of equipment in the tex- tual data set were automobiles and their components (see also Hirschman 1990; Levy 1986). The NASCAR advertise- ment shown in Figure 6 declares these race cars to be "mean, fast and tough," just like their drivers and other rugged indi- vidualists. A photo for an article in 4-Wheel &amp; Off-Road fea- tures a full-page photo of a "Big Mopar Monster" truck chal- lenging boulders in its path. The same magazine also carries a full-page, close-up photo of 44" truck tires, which it char- acterizes as "maximum meats" and "the biggest, baddest dogs in the mud hole" (Quinnell 2000c, p. 40). A full-page ad for Yamaha all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) por- trays a totemic (Lvi-Strauss 1968) form of anthropomor- phism in which the predatory power of a grizzly bear is im- puted to the vehicle. The ATV is claimed to be "the biggest, baddest utility ATV ever made." Thus, possession of this equipment will make its owner the dominant competitor, that is, the "top of the food chain."</page><page sequence="10">18 The Journal ofAdvertising FIGURE 6 NASCAR Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc. The NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series name and logo are used under license by the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc. and Sears, Roebuck and Co. Weapons. Various types of weapons were also commonly an- thropomorphized. A Ruger Model 96 rifle was characterized in one headline as "always ready, rugged and reliable." The body copy uses a simile, likening the rifle to "a good hunting companion." Dogs used for hunting, such as Labrador Re- trievers, Springer Spaniels, and Coonhounds, were also com- monly anthropomorphized in the texts examined. An advertisement for INNOTEK radio trackers not only anthro- pomorphized the dogs as possessing "durability, strength, agil- ity, endurance, versatility, and intelligence," it also transferred these same qualities to the tracking devices. Nature Versus Culture The oppositional tension between nature and culture is one of the most basic dualities recognized in anthropology (Levi- Strauss 1968) and consumer research (Holbrook and Grayson 1986). Thus, it is not surprising that this same bipolar pattern would be found in the rugged individualism ethos. Among the texts examined, nature was portrayed much more positively than was culture as a context in which rugged individualism could be enacted. Furthermore, within rugged individual- ism, nature was granted its own bidimensional structure; si- multaneously, it was represented as heaven and hell, joy and misery, friend and foe, and dangerous and comforting. This bipolarity of even a preferred locale (i.e., nature) cuts to the heart of rugged individualism as a belief system. For persons adhering to its tenets, enduring the challenges of hell is heaven, experiencing misery while completing a quest is joy, and facing danger successfully is comforting. Rugged individualism, as Nietzsche (1882-1888/1986) noted, requires its adherents to push themselves through pain, fear, exhaus- tion, thirst, cold, and hunger to feel completed. Without these challenges, life remains meaningless, the will untried, self- worth unproven. An advertisement for Windriver binoculars puts forward the ideal of one person challenging nature alone. The head- line "Proven in some of the roughest, wildest, most remote places imaginable. In other words, HEAVEN" equates rough- ness, wilderness, and remoteness with heaven. In such a set- ting, the rugged individualist can test the self and measure self-worth against nature's strongest challenges. Tapply (2000, p. 112) states this philosophy well: I hunt because I'm convinced ... that prehistoric man was a hunter before he was a farmer and because the genetic drive remains too powerful for me to resist. I do not need to hunt to eat, but I need to hunt to be fully who I am.... I hunt for the satisfying exhaustion after a long day in the woods.... I hunt because it reminds me that in nature there is a food chain, where everything eats and is, in its turn, eaten; where birth, survival, and reproduction give full meaning to life; where death is ever present; and where the only uncertainty is the time and manner of that death. Another article, this time on fishing, philosophizes simi- larly (Dean 2000, p. 81): After lunch the wind picked up, sending streams of foam across the surface, and rain began to fall again. In all my years of fishing in this harsh but beautiful land, I could recall only one other period-then in northern Quebec-where I had spent five straight days in raingear. Nevertheless, I had little to complain about. I had spent a week constantly fishing for- and catching-lake trout and northern pike in several differ- ent locations, seen a wide variety of wildlife, and eaten like a king over roaring open fires. After all that, being wet and chilly seemed a small price to pay. Articles about racing across the desert or up boulder-strewn mountains invoke a similar joy-from-hardship creed; the ar- ticle "30 Hours of Purgatory" (Cappa 2000, p. 96) declares: Thirty hours is a long time without sleep. Spending that 30 hours on some of the toughest trails in South Dakota shortly after and during one of the nastiest thunderstorms of the season is way beyond hell's staging area. This Purgatory has mosquitoes that attack in Kamikaze formation, draining enough blood from your body to make you feel queasy.... The thunderstorm the night before released hail the size of golf balls ... but this didn't stop the Black Hills 4-Wheelers from their masochistic 30-hour run. Complementary to this text's rhetoric of heroic endeavor was an advertisement for Goodyear Wrangler MTIR tires.</page><page sequence="11">Spring 2003 19 Headlined "The Badlands Ain't So Bad Anymore," the ad- vertisement depicts a Jeep Wrangler in an uphill posture and declares "big, aggressive treadblocks dig in deep for traction in mud, sand and on rocks." The use of "ain't" in the head- line implies an outlaw, rule-breaking attitude. The body copy also promises "the freedom to go where you want to," a key motivator for the self-directed rugged individualist. A funda- mental symbolism here is challenging nature through will, effort, and technology. This philosophy is put forward explicitly in an article on the Baja 2000 endurance road race (Fiolka 2000). One of the major attractions of the race simply has to be the utterly primitive conditions-man and machine against na- ture, as well as against other men and machines. Part of the thrill is the shudder of delight that comes from realizing what awful things could happen to you. In this highly regulated world in which we live, there are few competitions where you can accept such a basic challenge. Whereas nature's hellish aspects were sought after as a proving ground for self-worth, there was also a genuine en- thusiasm for nature as utopia, a purer, fresher, more potent form of experience that vivified the senses and animated the soul. One advertisement depicts a hand-drawn Jeep Wrangler astride a rugged mountain just outside the hermetically sealed office window of the protagonist. The empty office chair sug- gests that he has followed this whim; abandoned the computer, Rolodex, cell phone, and job; and escaped to the mountains. As the body copy proposes, "You have the freedom." An advertisement for Remington rifles is headlined "Ev- ery field is filled with hope." A hunter and his dog are shown trekking across an empty field in tandem, hoping that coveys of quail lie up ahead. Rhetorically, the iconography suggests it is truly a field of dreams in which possibilities eternally arise. Figure 7 is an advertisement for Mossy Oak camou- flage hunting apparel. The headline and body copy present what must be a happy fantasy for hunters: Their job is hunt- ing, and every day is spent working in heaven. Hurteau (2000, p. 142) expresses the transformative promise of reentering nature in straightforward prose: When I got home, I did a variety of nothing until about mid- night, when I decided to go out on the porch, rock in the rocking chair, and read for a bit. I opened the door and felt a breeze run across my face. It was the sort of breeze that some- times comes ahead of a late-summer Adirondack cold front: cooler than a cool summer breeze and carrying just a hint of the smell of snow in the distance. I stood there for a few seconds, just taking it in, and in my mind I could see the leaves of the beech trees that grow in the woods behind our house. They'd turned yellow and were edged white with frost. My hunting jacket hung from a nail beside the woodstove, and I saw our little creek running black beneath a film of ice ... and deer tracks pressed deep into new snow. FIGURE 7 Mossy Oak Mossy Oak Brand Camo, Haas Outdoors Inc. C 2000. Ad agency: Campbell Lacoste, Madison, WI I grinned like a kid ... a grin that comes from the knees, for no apparent reason, and makes you feel silly for grinning. I ran into the den and dug out my deer permit application, which had been buried for a couple of weeks. I filled it out and ran it to the mailbox. Individual Freedom Versus the Rule of Law Rugged individualism posits that humans were intended to exercise liberty through natural law (e.g., Nietzsche 1888/1967); that is, individual freedom is God granted and inalienable. From this view, governments and their laws are restrictive mecha- nisms that hamper freedom of expression and action. Histo- rian Kohl (1989, p. 148) writes, "Only liberation from the constraints of law would produce a truly health-giving, natural order.... [The] solution to disorder in society was not more law or better law, but the elimination of law." In the texts examined, perhaps nowhere was this senti- ment expressed more strongly than in the pages of Guns &amp; Ammo. Editorials, articles, letters to the editor, and advertise- ments argued against gun control and warned of the loss of liberty such restrictions would cause. In an editorial titled "Definitions Even the Constitutionally Challenged Can Un- derstand," Klein (2000, p. 28) writes:</page><page sequence="12">20 The Journal ofAdvertising You and I have a contract with our government.... The quid pro quo is as long as I maintain my citizenship I am entitled to the contractual rights.... If the government enforces a "non-amended" law that requires me to obtain a permit to own or carry a firearm, my "contractual" right to keep and bear arms has been lessened, disparaged. Charlton Heston, actor and president of the National Rifle Association (NRA), wrote (2000, p. 59): We're now down to the wire. This first election of the new millennium represents the last chance for America's first free- dom-your right to keep and bear arms. So even if you never do so again, this year is the one year to be a single-issue voter.... Right now, Al Gore and many anti-gun politicians are pushing gun bans, gun registration, gun owner licensing, gun rationing, ... gun owner photo IDs, gun locks, gunmaker lawsuits, gun show shutdowns, gun "buybacks," bans on toy guns and every other kind of feel-good but bad-idea gun gimmick they can dream up. And if they win on November 7, for the next de- cade and beyond, they'll have more power over your life and your rights than you probably ever imagined. Readers of hunting magazines held much the same view- point. Jeff Burk of Edgewood, NM, wrote Guns &amp; Ammo ("Letters to the Editor" 2000, p. 10) to complain about an earlier letter from a Hector Lopez, who favored gun control: This is in response to the letter by Hector Lopez in the Feb- ruary, 2000 issue of your magazine. He believes that while guns were once a necessary and important part of American culture, this is no longer the case. I find his attitude, logic and conclusions to be another example of the fuzzyheaded think- ing that seems to be all too prevalent in this country nowa- days.... The political machinery, special interests and big money corporations have a stranglehold on this country. The reasoning in the letter fairly reflects the worldview of rugged individualism: Persons are responsible for their own lives; they, and they alone, must provide the resources neces- sary to achieve their goals. Relying on others is an abrogation of the responsibility to protect self and interests. Even the off-road vehicle community expresses this same view: "Governments will curtail our freedom to choose, to act and to reach our self-directed aims" (Quinnell 2000a, p. 13). Governments do not protect but rather control. I believe I can say without reservation or doubt that if you enjoy off-roading, don't vote for Al Gore. I also feel very comfortable saying that even if you don't go off-roading, your freedom to enjoy the outdoors in a multitude of ways would be greatly diminished with Gore as our president.... There are other reasons too. Do you enjoy the V-8- or V-10-pow- ered pickup or SUV you're driving now? Gore would likely make it much more difficult for the Big Three (plus Toyota which has V-8-powered products too) to keep producing these or any other vehicle with enough power to put a smile on your face or safely tow your boat. (Quinnell 2000a, p. 13) Advertisers for guns play to this same ideology. In a print ad for Taurus firearms, the headline suggests that the preserva- tion of liberty can be aided by purchasing a weapon and join- ing an organization of like-minded consumers, such as the NRA: "Save our Constitutional Rights, Buy a Taurus (gun) and get a free NRA membership." In an interesting choice of words, the body copy of the advertisement describes the NRA as "the nation's pre-eminent civil rights organization." This rhetoric plays to the reader's fears that his or her individual freedoms are being eroded by a government that seems to show favorit- ism toward liberal issues. As Kohl (1989) argues, rugged indi- vidualists may feel themselves victimized by a government that seems to cater to the dependent, lazy, and irresponsible. Providing ironic tension to this prevailing antigovernment rhetoric were advertisements for Smith &amp; Wesson handguns and API hunting stands, which celebrate patriotism by show- ing American flags waving behind their products. This seem- ing contradiction in the rugged individualist ethos is made possible by the association of positive, heroic qualities to those who fight for America to defend freedom and liberty. Simul- taneously, the federal government is cast as a bloated, sinis- ter, inept institution. When '"America" is represented as its citizenry (proud, brave, unvanquished), it serves as a symbol of pride and loyalty. When 'America" is equated with gov- ernmental bureaucracy, it becomes a symbol of inequity, cor- ruption, and oppression. CONCLUSIONS Just as Tocqueville (1835/1985), Bellah and colleagues (1985), Inkeles (1983), Triandis (1995), and others have noted, rug- ged individualism is one set of behaviors and ideals charac- teristic of U.S. society. It is, at its core, a warrior philosophy that accepts the possibility of great personal peril, even vio- lent death, in the pursuit of self-perfection and the dominance of a given field of action. It is also a philosophy and a mode of consumption that invites critical commentary and normative debate. That advertisements are used to carry and communi- cate this ideology makes advertising a party to the debate. In recent years, the United States has edged closer to a creed that celebrates cooperative endeavor, self-abnegation, altruism, multiculturalism, and interpersonal harmony (e.g., Clatterbaugh 1997; Triandis 1995) while discouraging urges toward physical aggression and unbridled competition. As the advertising and other texts I examined indicate, those who embrace the ethos of rugged individualism view themselves and their lifestyle as under attack by this cultural shift. Gov- ernmental efforts to restrict access to firearms and political activism aimed toward banning hunting or limiting risk-tak- ing behaviors such as car racing or off-roading are seen as threats to the pursuit of self-construction, self-testing, and self-reliance embraced by rugged individualism.</page><page sequence="13">Spring 2003 21 Notably not addressed in this analysis are two cultural con- structs that could be pursued fruitfully in future advertising research on rugged individualism: gender and race. The un- spoken dialectics are the tension between masculinity and femininity and white versus nonwhite racial identity. Strik- ingly consistent with Nietzsche's (1882-1888/1968) ideology, both these unvoiced concepts are grounded in the distribu- tion of social and individual power in American society. Reexamining the texts, both editorial and advertising, used in the study shows them to be primarily grounded in an ide- ology of white male dominance. The cars, the guns, and the struggle for selfhood against and with nature are all based in a peculiarly American ethos of socially stratified nativism. Additional research is needed to unravel the relationships between male and female sources of power in U.S. culture and between white racial power versus that of other, non- white ethnicities. It is in the combined potencies of maleness and white- ness that rugged individualism finds its strength as a rhetori- cal device in advertising. And it is in the unspoken, but deeply felt, cultural connection between gender and race that rug- ged individualism finds itself the ultimate advertising icon of personal power, warriorhood, and heroic endeavor in Ameri- can culture. The reader is invited to reexamine the seven ad- vertisements shown in the analysis. Revisualize them with female or minority consumers, and immediately, their rhe- torical power is lessened and their meaning altered. The next task of research is to determine why.
