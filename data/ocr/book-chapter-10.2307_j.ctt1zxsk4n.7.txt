I have put in them a little door opening  onto a mystery.1 BEHEADING Two tales of decollations particularly  resonate in the Western artistic imagi- nation — that of Orpheus, the sublime  musician, and of John the Baptist,  the seer-prophet to whom the divine  voice spoke in the wilderness. Ancient  Greek myth identifi ed Orpheus as the  son of Apollo and Calliope (the Muse  I would like to thank the students in  my Nabokov Seminar at Hamilton of epic poetry). He was renowned as  College for their astute comments a skilled player of the lyre (a gift from  and suggestions for this article.

The  head prophesied with such renown that Apollo, in a fi t of jealousy, eventually  closed the Orphic oracle, because its popularity outrivaled that of his Delphic  shrine. “Orphism” was revived, or rather, reinvented by nineteenth-century  poets in the context of “the broader Romantic revival of poetic or imaginative  man . . . Orpheus represented the refl exive or self-conscious activity of the  imagination, the power by which man distinguishes himself as the single  artifi cer of the world in which he sings.”3 European artists of the century  painted Orpheus’s head with iconographic reverence and repetitiveness. For  example, Gustave Moreau’s earliest innovative renditions (“Thracian Girl  Carrying the Head of Orpheus,” 1864 and 1865) depict the head, crowned with  the poet’s laurel wreath, carried on his lyre by a young woman.4 Andre Breton  wrote of this exemplary image, “[A] priestess exchang[es] with Orpheus the  unutterable gaze of Hegelian ‘death’ and a human being to which it transmits  its secret.”5 Marcel Proust, on the same painting by Moreau: “Thus it is that  the poets do not wholly die and something of their true soul is kept for us,  something of that inner life in which alone they felt their true self expand and  live.”6 The Orphic head fi gures emblematically as the immortal repository of  divine imagination, poetry, and mystical knowledge. The severed cranium as a symbolic locus of knowledge is likewise  developed in the various accounts and depictions of John the Baptist. One  should recall the theological role of John as “precursor” or “forerunner” in the  Gospels. He is among the fi rst to be inspired by the logos to know that Jesus is  the Christ (“The word of God came to John . . . in the wilderness”);7 he possessed  theological knowledge, gnosis in its pure sense. John’s imprisonment was  politically and morally motivated; the result of his open challenge to Herod,  and his condemnation of Herod and Herod’s wife, Herodias, for moral  2 Thomas Bulfi nch, Myths of Greece and Rome (New York: Penguin Books, 1981), 218. 3 R.A.

It was, again, the nineteenth- century poets and painters who perceived in the biblical event a mystical  quality worthy of deeper analysis and interpretation. Modernist painters and  writers and, a few decades later, fi lm directors,11 concentrated on the dance of  Salome, often in the presence of or holding the detached head. Emblematic  of the latter-day interpretation of the event is Moreau’s “The Apparition”  8 Matthew 14:3-4; Mark 6:17-18. 9 Matthew 14:6-10; Mark 6:21-28. The dance, erotic by nature, thus takes the form of danse  macabre, a dance of death. See Hellmut Rosenfeld, Der mittelalterliche Totentanz:  Entstehung-Entwicklung-Bedeutung (Cologne: Bohlau Verlag, 1968); and Daniel Rancour- Laferriere, “All the World’s a Vertep: The Personifi cation/Depersonifi cation Complex in  Gogol’s Sorochinskaja jarmarka,” Harvard Ukrainian Studies VI.3 (September 1982):  344-7. In the Salome myth, eroticism prefi gures death. Thomas Mann noted the correlation  in his novel Joseph the Provider (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1944), 272-3: “There does exist  a certain relation between death and marriage, a bridal chamber and a tomb, a murder and  the abduction of a virgin. It is no great strain to think of a bridegroom as a god of death.” Does  Cincinnatus’s dance early in Nabokov’s text serve as a Salome-inspired prefi gurement of his  death by decapitation? Is the (homo)erotic overtone suggestive of the coitus=death equation?  “Rodion the jailer came in and offered to dance a waltz with him. Cincinnatus agreed. They  began to whirl. The keys on Rodion’s leather belt jangled . . . The dance carried them into the  corridor. Cincinnatus was much smaller than his partner. Cincinnatus was light as a leaf . . . his  big limpid eyes looked askance, as is always the case with timorous dancers . . . They described  a circle . . . and glided back into the cell, and now Cincinnatus regretted that the swoon’s friendly  embrace had been so brief” (Vladimir Nabokov, Invitation to a Beheading [New York: Paragon  Books, 1959], 13-4). 10 Two signifi cant monographs on John the Baptist iconography are: Raoul Plus, Saint Jean- Baptiste dans l’art (Paris: Editions Alsatia, 1937), and Oskar Thulin, Johannes der Taufer im  geistlichen Schauspiel des Mittelalters und der Reformationszeit (Leipzig: Dietrich, 1930). 11 So striking was the visual potential of the dance of death that between 1902 and 1922, ten silent  fi lm versions of Salome were made (four American, two German, two Italian, one French, one  British). See Derek Elley, The Epic Film: Myth and History (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul,  1984), 194-5. For a substantial analysis of the manipulation of the motifs from the legend of  John the Baptist and Salome in the novel, see Gavriel Shapiro, “The Salome Motif in Nabokov’s  Invitation to a Beheading,” in Delicate Markers: Subtexts in Vladimir Nabokov’s Invitation to  a Beheading (New York: Peter Lang, 1998). 30 </page> <page sequence="4"> R U S S I A N  N A B O K O V  (1876),12 in which the revivifi ed head of the Baptist, eyes wide open, blood  dripping from his neck and surrounded by a halo-sunburst, hovers before the  astonished dancer. Here the traditional norms of death have been abandoned.  The resurrection of the head is presented as a mystical accomplishment,  while the unvanquishable power of gnosis is proclaimed. The abstraction  is carried further in a startling icon (“The Glorifi cation of St. John”) of the  early twentieth century by J. H. Rosen, painted for the Armenian Cathedral in  L’viv.13 John’s headless torso (a sunburst in place of his head) stands serenely  in a row of saints. The head, with the mouth opened wide in agony, is held by  an attendant saint. The rays of light forming the sunburst are an iconographic  topos traditionally reserved for the mystical dove, the Holy Spirit, which is  the divine manifestation that can confer charismatic gifts of prophecy and  knowledge. In the poetic realm, then, the severed head is to be recognized as  metonymic of poetic imagination and mystical knowledge.14  BOATING AND BLUENESS In the literature of the Romantics and their followers, imagination and  fantasy were likened to boats, more precisely to ship cabins, which were  envisioned as isolated, expansive crania-wombs surrounded by the nurturing  sea. The cabins, with their single portholes, symbolized the place of mental  gestation and imaginistic peregrinations. Des Esseintes, the effete decadent  of Huysmans’ novel Against the Grain (1884), for example, constructs  precisely such a womb-cabin as the dining room (the place of nurturing) in  his hideaway: “The dining room . . . resembled a ship’s cabin with its wooden  ceiling of arched beams, its bulkheads and fl ooring of pitch-pine, its tiny  12 Pierre-Louis Mathieu, Gustave Moreau, The Watercolors (New York: Hudson Hills Press,  1985), 28-29, plate 11.

Freud developed the thesis in his analysis of the mythological theme of “the  horrifying decapitated head of Medusa.” ”To decapitate=to castrate. The terror of Medusa is  thus a terror of castration that is linked to the sight of something” (Sigmund Freud, “Medusa’s  Head.” The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works, vol. 18 [London: Hogarth  Press, 1953], 273). Is that “something” secret knowledge?

The mythology of boat-womb-cranium as a vehicle for imaginative travel is  further developed in Arthur Rimbaud’s “Le Bateau ivre [The Drunken Boat].”  The title conjoins the boat with intoxication, itself a mental transformation  and an inducement to imaginative journey.  Ostensibly, “Le Bateau ivre” describes the journey of the voyant in a tipsy boat  that has been freed from all constraints and launched headlong into a world of sea  and sky that is heaving with the erotic rhythms of a universal dynamic force. The  voyant himself is on an ecstatic search for some unnamed ideal that he seems to  glimpse through the aquatic tumult.16  Vladimir Nabokov hinted at the link between Rimbaud’s poem and his own  work. In Lolita, the verse is conjured up with a deliberately but tellingly  travestied title, “Le Bateau bleu [The Blue Boat].”17 Nabokov employed the  image of the boat in Invitation to a Beheading in a way quite sympathetic  to the signifi cance it had attained in earlier literature. Quite contrary to his  adamant claim that he “detest[ed] symbols and allegories (which is due  partly to my old feud with Freudian voodooism and partly to my loathing of  generalizations devised by literary mythists and sociologists”),18 a statement  that only brings attention to those things he claimed to avoid, Nabokov made  full use of a large cache of traditional symbols and metaphors. The prison cell  of Cincinnatus (the hero of Invitation) is likened to a ship’s cabin. As such, it  is representative of the imaginative writing he composes there (his “criminal  mind” being nurtured by it the way Raskol’nikov’s mind drew peculiar strength  from his tiny garret [каюта]).19 The cell is thus Cincinnatus’s hyperbolically  expanded brain, the womb of imagination, the dwelling-place of the last true  15 J.

P. Putnam’s Sons, 1955], 252). 18 Nabokov, “On a Book Entitled Lolita” (in Lolita, 316). 19 A workman who comes to give Raskol’nikov money called the garret “a ship’s cabin; ekaia  morskaia kaiuta” — this the room in which Raskol’nikov ruminates and hallucinates  (F. M. Dostoevskii, Prestuplenie i nakazanie [Moscow: Nauka, 1970], 94). 32 </page> <page sequence="6"> R U S S I A N  N A B O K O V  gnostic (“I knew what it is impossible to know”).20 The cell, “with its peephole  like a leak in a boat,” is where Cincinnatus becomes seasick, or alternately,  nearly drowns.21 From this “port” he sets off on an imagined journey by  tub-canoe in the spirit of des Esseintes. The mental journey is induced by  Cincinnatus’s writing a journal entry on Day fi ve.22 Thus accomplished  though art, the journey is reminiscent of the symbolist painter Odilon Redon’s  variation of the Orphic head. In his “Tete d’Orphee fl ottant sur les eaux”  (c. 1881), the upright head fl oats, its neck rooted in and drawing sustenance  from the water. Here is a vision of the cranium of imagination as a boat. In  a later variant (“Tete d’Orphee sur la lyre”), the lyre serves as vessel.23 How  eloquent and clear is the visual portrayal of the unity of symbols — head, boat,  water — the sources and nourishers of creativity and imagination! Nabokov reveals in Lolita that blue is the color of the boat inspired by  Rimbaud’s poem. Blue thus becomes the synonym for intoxication-fantasy.  Those critical colorists who have exhaustively analyzed the symbolic values of  various colors in various poetries and literatures report with great consistency  that  the blue sky . . . is a symbol employed throughout post-romantic literature of the  nineteenth and twentieth centuries to reveal man’s isolation, the indifference of  everything beyond the human sphere to the sufferings within him, to the hardships  and catastrophes of his existence.24  Further, as the critical psychoanalyst Jung states  We would conjecture that blue standing for the vertical means height and depth  (the blue sky above, the blue sky below) . . . The vertical would correspond to the  unconscious. But the unconscious in a man has feminine characteristics, and blue  is the traditional colour of the Virgin’s cloak.25  20 Ibid., 95. 21 Nabokov, Invitation, 12-13, 57. 22 Ibid., 64-5. 23 Robert Coustet, L’Univers d’Odilon Redon (Paris: Henri Screpel, 1984), 84; Roseline Bacou,  La donation Ari et Suzanne Redon (Paris: Editions de la Reunion des musees nationaux,  1984), 13. 24 W.

The bilingual punster has yet another trick he can play: Goluboi (goluben’kii),  the “blue” of blue skies, of Nabokov’s blue porthole (“goluboi glazok”), blue  temples (“golubizna viskov”), and “bluest blue” pulsating veins (“golubye,  kak samoe goluboe, pul’sirovali zhilki”), are all slang for gay/homosexual, the  Russian equivalent of l’amour bleu, linking Cincinnatus’s imagination to his  ambiguous gender role.26 Nabokov accepts and employs both the normative signifi cance of blue as  intellect, and its secondary signifi cance as femininity in his novel Invitation to  a Beheading. The reader is invited to the beheading of a “blue” character, one  who stands out from the others in the text because of his intellectual capacities  and his uncertain sexuality. But the text is also an invitation to intellectual  search and creative thinking on the part of the reader; the text is riddled with  allusions to boating and to the color blue. These hints underlie the entirety  of the novel, forming its hidden structure of signifi cation in a multi-layered,  bilingual, shifting, and expansive verbal game. Let us attempt to trace these  underlying meanings; to enter Nabokov’s game to unravel its signifi cance. To  do so requires the reader to become a player and match the moves of the well- known chess master. NABOKOV’S CEREBRAL WEDDING GAME  IN INVITATION TO A BEHEADING The Queen turned crimson with fury,  and . . . began screaming. “Off with her  head! Off with — ” Koroleva pobagrovela  ot iarosti . . . i riavknula: “Otrubit’ ei  golovu! Otrub . . . ”27 The traditional Russian village wedding as recorded by nineteenth- century ethnographers was a protracted ceremony which, in folk parlance,  was termed igra, a ritualized “game,” a community-wide performance with  formalized acts and scenes. The celebration was an elaborately orchestrated  26 Nabokov, Invitation, 26, 36, 121, 124. 27 Lewis Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland: and, Through the Looking-glass and what  Alice found there (London: Penguin Classics, 2003), 281; Vladimir Nabokov, trans., Ania v  strane chudes, Sobranie sochinenii russkogo perioda v 5 tt. vol. 1 (St. Petersburg: Symposium,  1999), 405. 34 </page> <page sequence="8"> R U S S I A N  N A B O K O V  affair, highly theatrical, that is, artifi cial, in nature. Mid- and late- twentieth  century American weddings, those “once-in-a-lifetime” staged extravaganzas,  share much of the spirit of their Russian counterparts.28 The bride and groom  become king and queen for a day, the central characters in an often overly  staged drama of union which climaxes, at least ideally, in the annihilation of  the bride’s virginity on the wedding night. One expansive subtext of Nabokov’s  Invitation to a Beheading [Priglashenie na kazn’]29 is a broad burlesque  of this wedding “game,” which is intensifi ed by delightful inversions and  perversions. Nabokov’s will be in essence a gay wedding — the mock union of  two men, an executioner and the executionee, Pierre and Cincinnatus, whose  nuptial bed is an execution block on Thriller Square. The crux of Nabokov’s wedding game is the linking of balls and berries,  the folkloric images of ripe female fecundity, with Cincinnatus’s head. The  berry is frequently encountered in East Slavic wedding songs, particularly  in velichaniia, songs of praise, often deliberately profane,30 sung to the  bridal couple during the wedding feast. In a song addressed to the bride, for  example, we hear: “Zemlianika-iagodka / Otchego-zhe ty krasna? / Oi, liuli,  oi liuli, / Otchego-zhe ty krasna?; O little berry, little strawberry/ Why are  you so red? / O la-dee-da, / Why are you so red?”; and in a typical expanded  couplet addressed to the bride and groom: “Vinograd v sadu tsvetet, /  A iagoda, a iagoda sozrevaet. / Vinograd-to — Ivan-sudar’, / A iagoda,  a iagoda — svet Praskov’ia ego, / A iagoda, a iagoda — svet Ivanovna ego;  A vine blossoms in the garden, / A berry, a berry is ripening. / Now the vine  is Master Ivan, / And the berry, the berry is his beloved Praskov’ia, / And the  28 For an evocative collection of photos of American weddings, quite in keeping with the spirit of  Nabokov’s commentary on the “glossy fi ctionalization” of life (Invitation, 50-1), see Barbara  Norfl eet, Wedding (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1979). This was the catalogue for an  exhibition of photographs at the Carpenter Center for Visual Arts, Harvard University (1976).  Note in particular a 1944 photo of a chubby fellow in a bridesmaid’s veil holding a bouquet  of pansies and the photos of guests admiring gifts. 29 Russian text written in 1934 and fi rst serialized in the Paris émigré journal Sovremennye  zapiski June 1934-March 1936. Invitation to a Beheading, English translation (New York:  Paragon Books, 1959). 30 A universal tendency corroborated in Mann’s recounting of Joseph’s wedding feast: “More and  more as the evening wore on, the laughter and rejoicing rather coarsely betrayed the real idea  at the bottom of a wedding feast, the thought of what was naturally to follow. One might put it  that the idea of abduction and murder and the idea of fertility came together and fl owed into  license; so that the air was full of offensive innuendo, of winking, obscene allusions, and roars  of laughter” (Joseph, 276). Compare with Nabokov’s description of the “informal supper,” at  which “the guests roared” at Pierre’s telling of a bawdy anecdote (Invitation, 183-4).  Franklin Sciacca 35 </page> <page sequence="9"> F I R S T  T I M E  B A L L  berry, the berry is his beloved Ivanovna.”31 In Evgenii Onegin, Pushkin plays  with this folkloric connotation: “When we’ve lured a fellow, / when afar we see  him, / we shall scatter, dear ones, / pelter him with berries, / with cherries,  with raspberries, / with red currants.”32 “The snowball tree, the raspberry,  the red currant,” the folklorist Sokolov modestly observed in his discussion  of the imagery of wedding songs, “are the symbols of a girl just entering  into marriage. The latter symbols, like many others, are based upon frankly  sexual, erotic factors.”33 Clinically speaking, the berry makes reference to the  virgo intacta, the symbol of the state of maidenhead. Balls (and melons) are  hyperbolic infl ations of that symbol of intact virginity, a grotesque gigantism  of the petite fl ora “cherry” that, in English slang too, connotes virginity and  the intact hymen. Nabokov’s Invitation is cluttered with berries, red fruits and balls — a  cornucopia of feminine sexuality: “ruddy and glossy” cherries, apples, “rosy  kisses tasting of wild strawberries,” “a dozen yellow plums,” “a piece of brilliant  barberry-red hard candy” on Emmie’s tongue, “a spurting peach,” “apricot  moon.”34 Even Pierre identifi es himself as “an Elderburian; Vyshnegradets”  (“Call on me, I shall treat you to some of our elderburies” [rendered as vyshni  in the Russian text]) jubilates Pierre a la Rudy Panko.35 The ball appears as  31 N.

See also the  folkloric examples culled from Propp and Dal’ in Daniel Rancour-Laferriere, “Pushkin’s  Still Unravished Bride: A Psychoanalysis of Tat’jana’s Dream,” in Russian Literature and  Psychoanalysis, ed. Daniel Rancour-Laferriere (Amsterdam and Philadelphia: J. Benjamins  Publishing Co., 1989). In Russian literature, particularly among the “village-prose” writers  and those infl uenced by them, the motif is prolifi c. See for example Yevgeny Yevtushenko,  Iagodnye mesta (Moskva: Sovetskii pisatel’, 1982) [Wild Berries (NY: W. Morrow, 1984)],  and Vasilii Shukshin, Snowball Berry Red [Kalina krasnaia] (Ann Arbor, Mich.: Ardis, 1979).  Updike, undoubtedly unaware of the rich folkloric associations, laments the repetition of  the symbol in Yevtushenko’s novel (“as if repeating things rendered them profound”). “Wild  Berries begins . . . with a hail of berries, as symbols of succulence, Siberian freedom, and female  charms. A seduced and spurned woman ponders, ‘He’s picked all my berries, and now he’s  looking for new berry patches;’ another, also seduced and spurned woman sports ‘red bilberry  nipples’ and ‘dark, berrylike birthmarks’ ‘sprinkled’ on her ‘soft but blinding white’ skin; and  still another, while being seduced preliminary to being abandoned, has a full basket of berries  spilled over her (of course) ‘naked breasts’” (John Updike, “Books. Back in the U. S. S.

The  ball is Emmie’s — that Ur-Lolita’s — plaything, her object of temptation.  Emmie, the director’s daughter . . . a mere child, but with the marble calves of  a little ballerina was bouncing a ball, rhythmically against the wall . . . Emmie was  gazing after them, while she lightly plopped the glossy red and blue ball in her  hands.36  Now the colors red and blue take over and forge the link to Cincinnatus.  Red is the color of blood, streaming from the decapitated head/defl owered  maidenhead, as well as the color of the place of execution, “the vermillion  platform of the scaffold”37 — a perfect anthropomorphic touch, Cincinnatus’s  world mirroring his condition. The pain of execution itself will be “red and  loud,” “bol’ rasstavaniia budet krasnaia, gromkaia,” Cincinnatus wrote in his  diary.38 Cincinnatus’s head is blue, the Romantics’ color for divine inspiration,  as well as an indication of homosexual proclivity. Nabokov speaks fi rst of “the  azure of [Cincinnatus’s] temples,” and later of “the other Cincinnatus . . . all  curled up in a ball.”39 In his poetic reverie on Day eight, Cincinnatus espies his  “dream world”: “Dreamy, round, and blue, it turns slowly toward me; Sonnyi,  vypukhlyi, sinii, on medlenno obrashchaetsia ko mne.”40  Presaging the decapitation, Cincinnatus’s head, the repository of artistry,  becomes Emmie’s red and blue ball. Nabokov approaches his most grotesque  in the playfulness of Emmie’s vague offer of escape in the form of her rolling  ball.  Just then, silently and not very fast, a red-and-blue ball rolled in through the door  [of the cell], followed one leg of a right triangle straight under the cot, disappeared  for an instant, thumped against the chamber pot, and rolled out along the other  cathetus — that is, toward Rodion, who without noticing it, happened to kick it as  he took a step; then, following the hypotenuse, the ball departed into the same  chink through which it had entered.41  The kicking of Cincinnatus’s head repulses the attentive reader. 36 Ibid., 41. 37 Ibid., 218. It is of curious note that an arcane secondary meaning of “maiden” is “a former  Scottish beheading device resembling the guillotine,” Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary  Tenth Edition (Springfi eld, Mass.: Merriam-Webster, Inc., 1993), 699. 38 Ibid., 194, 190. 39 Ibid., 69. 40 Ibid., 93, 99. 41 Ibid., 66. Franklin Sciacca 37 </page> <page sequence="11"> F I R S T  T I M E  B A L L  Nabokov expands and reinforces the motif during the pre-execution feast:  the table is loaded “with heaps of apples each as big as a child’s head, [shining]  among dusty-blue bunches of grapes.” The boys who run after the carriage  carrying Cincinnatus to the execution block are sympathetically identifi ed as  “red and blue.”42 The berry is hyperbolically expanded into succulent melons  and watermelons, the objects of sexual teasing and play.  Emmie sat down at the table . . . [and] began spreading sugar . . . on her shaggy slice  of melon; thereupon she bit into it busily, holding it by the ends, which reached her  ears, and brushing her neighbor [Pierre] with her elbow. Her neighbor continued  to sip his tea, holding the spoon protruding from it between second and third  fingers, but inconspicuously, reached under the table with his left hand. “Eek!”  cried Emmie as she gave a ticklish start, without, however, taking her mouth from  the melon.43  Here again is the delightfully vulgar Nabokov at work. The imagery suggests, in the end, that Cincinnatus’s head is at once  toy, plaything, and maidenhead, a female sex organ. Nabokov is toying with  the classical and Romantic notion that art, inspiration, the Muse are to be  allegorized as feminine. Cincinnatus’s head is for many reasons the object of  Pierre’s desire. This sense of longing is reinforced by the incessant attention  Pierre pays to Cincinnatus’s neck.44 In the cache of Nabokov’s recurrent motifs,  the “female neck seems to focus [on] . . . desire . . . Throughout Nabokov’s world,  the attraction of female necks ranges from a delicate, melancholy beauty to  intense desire, . . . attended by a specifi c seeking of relief.”45 The verbal and visual attention Pierre lavishes on Cincinnatus’s neck  again serves to highlight the artifi cially and symbolically sexual nature of  the relationship, including the casting of Cincinnatus in the role of undefi led  maiden, “preparing for those involuntary bodily movements that directly  follow severance of the head.”46 In his pretentious boasting of his attraction to  women Pierre declares that he is particularly attracted to necks as the focus of  sexual longing.  42 Ibid., 185, 215. 43 Ibid., 166-167. 44 Ibid., e.g., 89, 109. 45 W. W. Rowe, “A Note on Nabokov’s Erotic Necks,” Russian Literature Triquarterly 16 (1979):  50, 52. Rowe makes no attempt to comment on the signifi cance of Pierre’s attraction to  Cincinnatus’s neck. Material from Invitation is cited in such a way that Pierre fi ts the category  of Nabokov’s precocious experts on women!  46 Nabokov, Invitation, 17. 38 </page> <page sequence="12"> R U S S I A N  N A B O K O V  “I caught just a glimpse of your spouse — a juicy little piece, no two ways about  it — what a neck, that’s what I like”; “sheia bol’no khorosha”. “I don’t know about  you, but when it comes to caresses I love what we French wrestlers call ‘macarons’:  You give her a nice slap on the neck, and, the firmer the meat . . . ”47  Pierre’s eyes consistently focus on Cincinnatus’s neck with unambiguous  sexual desire. “The vein on our neck is throbbing . . . ” [ . . . ]  “Excuse me, what is that you have on your neck — right here, here — yes,  here.”  “Where?” Cincinnatus asked mechanically, feeling his neck vertebrae.  M’sieur Pierre went over to him and sat down on the edge of the cot. “Right  here,” he said, “but I see now that it was only a shadow. I thought I saw . . . a little  swelling of some kind. You seem uncomfortable when you move your head. Does  its hurt? Did you catch a chill?”  “Oh, stop pestering me, please,” Cincinnatus said, sorrowfully.  “No, just a minute. My hands are clean — allow me to feel here. It seems, after  all . . . Does it hurt here? How about here?”  With his small but muscular hand he was rapidly touching Cincinnatus’s neck  and examining it carefully, breathing through the nose with a slight wheeze.  “No, nothing. Everything is in order,” he said at last, moving away and slapping  the patient on the nape — “Only you do have an awfully thin one — otherwise  everything is normal, it’s just that sometimes, you know . . . ”48 We can understand the reference to the “shadow” as the “shadow of an ax,”  introduced in the preceding chapter; while the “slap” is precisely the macaron  of the “French wrestler,” the indication of virile sexual arousal, the symbol of  which is the ax.49 Finally, Pierre recounts how he maneuvered to get to know  Cincinnatus. The results are before you. We grew to love each other, and the structure of  Cincinnatus’s soul is as well known to me as the structure of his neck. Thus it will  47 Ibid., 144-145. Here Nabokov is certainly paying tribute to Tolstoy, and Pierre’s namesake in  War and Peace. In Book Eleven of Tolstoy’s novel, Pierre Bezukhov drinks with Ramballe,  who, impressed by Pierre’s presence on the fi eld of battle at Borodino, extols him, “‘So you  are one of us soldiers! . . . So much the better, so much the better, Monsieur Pierre! Terrible in  battle . . . gallant . . . with the fair’ (he winked and smiled), ‘that’s what the French are, Monsieur  Pierre, aren’t they?’” Leo Tolstoy, War and Peace, Norton Critical Edition, Second Edition  (New York: W. W. Norton, 1996), 805. 48 Nabokov, Invitation, 85, 109. 49 Ibid., 92.

Aside from “the Priapus who had nourished [Marthe]” and Quercus, the giant  oak of the “famous” novel,52 the most persistent phallus in the chronicle is  Cincinnatus’s pencil, a penile motif that Nabokov no doubt extrapolated  from Andrei Bely’s Petersburg and employs in Invitation as an homage to  the Symbolist writer. Bely’s pencil is the attribute of the father-statesman,  Apollon Apollonovich, and is introduced very early in the novel. While the  Freudian signifi cance of such scenes as “Apollon Apollonovich was wont to  express his agony by breaking packets of pencils which were kept for just  such an occasion,”53 is tangential to our argument here, its psycho-symbolic  function in betraying the perverse sexual tension between father and child is  not. The following passage was a ripe fi eld for Nabokov, from which he seems  to have harvested fruit, pencils, throbbing necks, convulsing heads and red  faces — the stuff of his little game in Invitation to a Beheading. Would it  in fact be too absurd to suggest that this very passage inspired much of the  essence of Invitation? Apollon Apollonovich stood chewing his lips ironically. His skin gathered in tiny  wrinkles. It stretched taut on his skull. A serious talk was in the air: the fruit had  ripened; it would fall; it fell and — suddenly:  Apollon Apollonovich dropped a pencil [karandashik] (by the staircase). From  ingrained habit, Nikolai Apollonovich rushed to pick it up. Apollon Apollonovich  rushed to forestall him, but he stumbled and fell, his hands touching the bottom  steps. His head fell forward and down and unexpectedly landed under the fingers  of his son’s hand. Nikolai Apollonovich caught sight of his father’s neck (an  artery was throbbing on one side). The neck’s warm pulsation frightened him. He  snatched his hand away, but he snatched it too late: at the touch of the cold hand  the senator’s head convulsed in a spasm. His ears twitched slightly. Like a jumpy  Japanese ju-jitsu teacher, he threw himself to the side and straightened up on  cracking knees. 50 Ibid., 175. 51 Ibid., 178. 52 Ibid., 141, 122-3. 53 Andrei Bely, Petersburg, trans.

Nikolai Apollonovich handed his father the tiny  little pencil.  “Here!”  A trifle had knocked them one against the other, and had produced in both an  explosion of thoughts and feelings. Apollon Apollonovich got completely flustered  by the fear he felt in response to politeness (this male in red [domino] was the flesh  of his flesh, and to be frightened by one’s own flesh was disgraceful). He had been  sitting under his son, on his haunches. Apollon Apollonovich felt annoyance as  well. He assumed a dignified manner, bowed from the waist, and compressed his  lips primly:  “Thank you. I wish you pleasant dreams.”  Nikolai Apollonovich felt a rush of blood to his cheeks, and when he thought  he was beginning to blush, he had actually turned crimson. Apollon Apollonovich,  seeing that his son was turning crimson, himself began to blush. In order to hide  the blush, he flew up the staircase, with coquettish grace.54  In Bely’s text the pencil is a key motif in exposing a disturbing sexual tension  between father and son, which frightens them both. Moreover, because it  is the instigator of this strange encounter between father and son, who are  also victim and would-be murderer, the pencil, clearly linked here to Apollon  Apollonovich’s neck, draws from Nikolai Apollonovich the realization that his  father is human and vulnerable. Nikolai Apollonovich’s power over his father  as the old man tumbles down the stairs to his feet is a mixture of sexual  domination (focused, as in Invitation, around the neck and its pulsating  veins) and control over life and death. The Nabokov pencil is similarly  symbolic of these themes of mortality and sexuality; it measures the time  to Cincinnatus’s execution/wedding day, growing shorter and shorter as his  diary lengthens.  The pencil is fi rst introduced on Day one: “On the table glistened a clean  sheet of paper and, distinctly outlined against this whiteness, lay a beautifully  sharpened pencil, as long as the life of any man except Cincinnatus . . . ” By the  eighth day it “has lost more than a third of its length” — a hint of the execution  day to the careful reader, who now is privy to that piece of information  so sought by Cincinnatus, “the exact execution date.”55 The narrator  opens Chapter eight, which, by the way, is almost entirely excerpted from  Cincinnatus’s diary, with a parenthetic notice, perhaps a comment on some  technique of intercourse or masturbation:  54 Ibid., 152 (1922 text). 55 Nabokov, Invitation, 12, 89, 36. Franklin Sciacca 41 </page> <page sequence="15"> F I R S T  T I M E  B A L L  There are some who sharpen a pencil toward themselves, as if they were peeling  a potato, and there are others who slice away from themselves, as though whittling  a stick . . . Rodion was of the latter number. He had an old penknife with several  blades and a corkscrew. The corkscrew slept on the outside.56  Such intimate details about the life of the pencil independent from Cincinnatus  add to its phallic shape to decisively establish the pencil as a male character  intruding into the text. It provides a means of eternalizing Cincinnatus’s  imagination in the form of his diary; the union of the female intellect with  the male pencil produces a text, an independent entity. The (hetero)sexual  intercourse of mind and pencil is an act of reproduction creating art.  The interaction, however, is not equal. While the execution that follows  the completion of the journal fulfi lls Cincinnatus’s imagination and propels it  into eternity, into a new world “where, to judge by the voices, [stand] beings  akin to him,”57 the conclusion of Cincinnatus’s work represents absolute  death for the pencil, which returns to the oblivion and meaninglessness of  the other props around Cincinnatus once its task is accomplished. Indeed, the  shortening of the pencil corresponding to Cincinnatus’s diminishing life span  is underscored by its gradual disappearance from the text; on the day before  the execution, Cincinnatus’s writing implement is no more than a “stunted  pencil,”58 and once Cincinnatus has completed his text with the word “death”  (which is “immediately crossed out”), the pencil vanishes from the text. He is  now, in effect, castrated. By dropping and losing any further contact with his pencil, Cincinnatus  is left with only his intellect, his blue and red feminized head, his berry, ripe  for the picking. Cincinnatus is ready to become Pierre’s bride, his maiden  fair, as Pierre had pronounced to him, “To me you are as transparent  as — excuse the sophisticated simile — a blushing bride is transparent to the  gaze of an experienced bridegroom.”59 It is established early in the text that  both Cincinnatus and Pierre shun sexual relations with women. Cincinnatus  rejects his wife and Emmie, the former with the imperious exclamation, “Oh,  don’t — what nonsense,” in response to her offer, “If you need it badly, Cin-Cin,  go ahead, only do it quickly.”60 As for Pierre, he is impotent with women. In spite  of his declarations of sexual prowess, he is unable to “perform” with Marthe:  56 Ibid., 89. 57 Ibid., 223. 58 Ibid., 206. 59 Ibid., 162. 60 Ibid., 197. 42 </page> <page sequence="16"> R U S S I A N  N A B O K O V  [Marthe] returned only in three quarters of an hour, snorting contemptuously.  She put one foot on the chair, snapped her garter, and, angrily readjusting the  pleats below her waist, sat down at the table, . . . “All for nothing,” she said with  a sneer . . . “Shouldn’t try if you can’t manage it . . . ”61  We learn that Pierre was the object of her scorn from the impotent himself:  “‘Outrageous! Intolerable!’ M’sieur Pierre was shouting . . . ‘I am not  well . . . They serve me with spoiled fi sh they offer me a disgusting whore . . . ’”62  In Cincinnatus’s presence, on the contrary, Pierre is sexually aroused. Having  just referred to Cincinnatus as a blushing bride, Pierre exposes to him the  “broad shining ax,” the instrument of execution, and then quickly is unnerved,  saying, “We are both young — you must not remain here any longer . . . I too  am excited, I too am not in complete control of myself, you must understand  this.”63 The reader fully grasps that the execution will indeed mime the  sexual act, while at the same time it functions in imitation of the beheadings  of Orpheus and John the Baptist –decapitations that mystically liberate  artistry and spirituality. Pierre will brandish his ax (the object of “anxiety”  in Nabokov’s word play in the English text);64 Cincinnatus will sacrifi ce his  innocent maiden-like head, his berry.  But what of the wedding ritual preceding intercourse, required by  tradition and law? Pierre is too decorous to permit sex without marriage,  hence the nuptial rituals, starting with the formal introduction of Cincinnatus  and Pierre, the bride and groom. This is, in the Russian folk tradition, an  arranged match. The carefully monitored meetings of the betrothed couple  are to permit their getting acquainted before the ceremony. They are fi rst  introduced on Day seven. This is the svatanie, complete with the Director’s  (he plays the role of the svat) admonition to Pierre not to “fi nd fault” with  Cincinnatus.  “Allow me to present to you M’sieur Pierre,” said the director to Cincinnatus  in jubilant tones. “Come in, come in, M’sieur Pierre. You can’t imagine how  you have been awaited here — Get acquainted gentlemen — The long-awaited  meeting — An instructive spectacle . . . Do bear with us, M’sieur Pierre, do not find  fault . . . ”65 61 Ibid., 199. 62 Ibid., 208. 63 Ibid., 163. 64 Ibid., 103. 65 Ibid., 81. Franklin Sciacca 43 </page> <page sequence="17"> F I R S T  T I M E  B A L L  The groom accepts Cincinnatus as his fi ancée and pronounces formulaically,  “I make bold to hope that we may get to know each other more closely.” Pierre  proceeds to court and charm Cincinnatus, in part with comic demonstrations  of physical feats and with jokes, while Rodrig’s eyes “[grow] moist from  all these joyous titters and ejaculations.”66 Pierre judges his efforts to be  successful. On Day sixteen he gives clear voice to the notion of ceremonial  sacrament, the union of the two:  [Pierre] went on, batting his eyelashes: “I need not explain how precious to the  success of our common undertaking is that atmosphere of warm camaraderie which,  with the help of patience and kindness, is gradually created between the sentenced  and the executor of the sentence. It is difficult or even impossible to recall without  a shudder the barbarity of long-bygone days, when these two, not knowing each  other at all, strangers to each other, but bound together by implacable law, met face  to face only at the last instant before the sacrament itself. This has all been changed  just as the ancient, barbaric wedding ceremony, more closely resembling a human  sacrifice — when the submissive virgin was hurled by her parents into the tent of  a stranger — has changed with the passing of time.”67 The proclamation asserts that the union, a mystical bond, has been achieved.  The feast to celebrate the marriage takes the form of an “informal supper,”  which is a cinematically inspired perversion of a traditional wedding feast.  The inverted sexual undertone is emphasized by the identifi cation of all guests  as men, save for a lone physiologically stereotyped lesbian:  There were no ladies present, unless one counted the district superintendent of  schools, a very stout, elderly woman in a gray frock coat cut like a man’s, with large  flat cheeks and a smooth hairdo as shiny as steel . . . [and a] husky voice . . . 68  The waiters were “adroit dandies — the best representatives of its purple  youth”; “luchshie predstaviteli ego malinovoi molodezhi.” Thus, an all-male  cast celebrates the union of Pierre and Cincinnatus, who sat “side by side at the  head of a dazzling table . . . identically clad in Elsinore jackets” and “everyone  began to glance, with restraint at fi rst, then with benevolent curiosity — which  in some began to turn into surreptitious tenderness — at the pair . . . ” The  nuptial nature of the event is further emphasized by the traditional chanting  of “Bitter, bitter, sweeten it with a kiss,” “Gor’ko!”69  66 Ibid., 82, 84. 67 Ibid., 173. 68 Ibid., 182, 188. 69 Ibid., 180, 182, 185. 44 </page> <page sequence="18"> R U S S I A N  N A B O K O V  The fi nal ritual is the consummation, the defl owering-decapitation to  which, in the Russian folk tradition, the gathered guests were eager witnesses  of a sort. This is attested to in the less prudish ethnographic accounts of the  peasant wedding-game — the public examination of the marriage night bed  sheet. Only the red stain of blood on the sheet (sympathetically anticipated  in the text by the “red platform”)70 would prove the virginity of the bride, the  mark of the “red” wedding. In his memoirs, Damon Orlow recounts just such  a moment in the wedding drama: We are approaching the most important, the most delicate, yet essential act of  the wedding. Its very nature compels your narrator to seek refuge, if possible at all,  in euphemistic phraseology . . .   Behind a door locked from the outside, the couple was closeted, to spend the  night . . . The supervisory committee, holding the keys to the chamber, stood on  guard the whole night . . . [In the morning] the committee, having duly examined  the marks and signs of the memorable night, came out and officially reported the  glorious findings, positively and unquestionably certifying to the unimpeachable  purity of [the bride’s] virtue, of her integrity, of her virginity.71 Nabokov is less discreet. Assembled guests (with the reader as an implied  observer) watch Pierre and Cincinnatus engage in disrobing and preparation  for intercourse, the beheading to which all had been invited in the title of  the novel — ax to neck, the sacrifi ce of head-cherry, with which the game,  Nabokov’s text, climaxes:  “No excitement, no fuss, please,” said M’sieur Pierre. “We shall first of all remove  our little shirt.” “By myself,” said Cincinnatus. “That’s the boy. Take the little shirt  away, men. Now I shall show you how to lie down.” M’sieur Pierre dropped onto  the block. The audience buzzed. “Is this clear?” asked M’sieur Pierre, springing up  and straightening his apron (it had come apart at the back, Rodrig helped tie it).  “Good. Let’s begin. The light is a bit harsh . . . Perhaps you could . . . There, that’s  fine. Thank you. Perhaps just a wee bit more . . . Excellent! Now I shall ask you to  lie down.” “By myself, by myself,” said Cincinnatus and lay face down as he had  been shown, but at once he covered the back of his neck with his hands. “What  a silly boy,” said M’sieur Pierre from above. “If you do that how can I . . . (yes, give  it here; then, immediately after, the bucket). And anyway why all this contraction  of muscles? There must be no tension at all. Perfectly at ease. Remove your hands,  please . . . (give it to me now). Be quite at ease . . . ”72 70 Ibid., 202. 71 Damon Orlow, Red Wedding (Chicago: Henry Regnery Co., 1952), 33-4. 72 Nabokov, Invitation, 221-2. Franklin Sciacca 45 </page> <page sequence="19"> F I R S T  T I M E  B A L L  These fi nal words of M’sieur Pierre ring out beyond the stage-set world of the  town and the prison, beyond Cincinnatus’s world of imagination, directly to  the reader, who is seeing and caressing the last page of the Invitation. We also  must soon “remove [our] hands” from the book. Nabokov’s voice, through  Pierre, is commanding us to be “quite at ease,” to let go of Cincinnatus’s life  and of our anxiety for him. Now indeed  . . . we are nearing the end. The right-hand, still untasted part of the novel, which,  during our delectable reading, we would lightly feel, mechanically testing whether  there were still plenty left . . . has suddenly, for no reason at all, become quite  meager: a few minutes of quick reading already downhill . . . 73 We readers had been watching Cincinnatus’s twenty-day progress to the  execution block along with the other invitees, the vomiting librarian,  the transparent spectators, the dog-masked guards, M’sieur Pierre the  executioner; but now we are about to part with them and with their quickly  disintegrating world. The references to Russian and American marriage  traditions, which had been hovering around the sexually charged execution,  emerge in our understanding as an allegorical parody. The verbal games and  symbols Nabokov had been using begin to form coherent structures, and his  hints fi nally surge with meaning as our comprehension of the novel clarifi es. In fact, when we begin to understand Nabokov’s games with colors,  boats, and berries, we are surprised to fi nd that he applies at least some of the  imagery to our world, to the readers’ world outside the novel. He continues his  description of the “still untasted part of the novel” by comparing it to a bowl  of cherries, reminding us that  The heap of cherries whose mass had seemed to us of such a ruddy and glossy  black, had suddenly become discrete drupes: the one over there with the scar is  a little rotten, and this one has shriveled and dried up around its stone (and the  very last one is inevitably hard and unripe) O horrible!74 What has Nabokov achieved in this giant verbal, imaginative game? It  is a grotesque farce, a game invented around the humdrum vulgarity of  “average reality” and its traditions. The mock wedding ceremony is one act  in the vast circus-panorama of the text — a display of artifi ce remarkably  versatile and evasive. Taken as a burlesque, a mini-comedy, it fi ts neatly into  73 Ibid., 12. 74 Ibid. 46 </page> <page sequence="20"> R U S S I A N  N A B O K O V  Nabokov’s own proclaimed concept of the lack of value of ideas in art. But  Nabokov is cajoling us to do more than double-think about berries, crania,  allegories and marriage; his verbal games are training exercises. Since  reading is an individual experience, the beheading must ultimately be ours,  the readers’ — we have read, we have been trained to read allegories and,  with open minds, we can learn from them. Cincinnatus’s beheading was  allegorically an escape from the constraints of the world where “everything  was falling” to a shimmering, shiny world. Nabokov is inviting us to transcend  the limits of “average reality” with our imagination, to join voices with which  we can communicate in created intellectual worlds. The very process of  decoding Nabokov’s verbal game is a signpost on the route to this liberating  world of the intellect. Just as Orpheus’s and John the Baptist’s severed heads  served as conduits to the worlds of poetry and gnosis, so should Cincinnatus’s  blood-letting lead to true existence. The decapitated head is a boat released  from its moorings free to travel the sea of “true reality.” The overall effect is  that the reader, laying aside the novel, leaves the stage with Cincinnatus, and  is now free to make “his way in that direction where, to judge by the voices,  stood beings akin to him.”75 75 Ibid., 223.
