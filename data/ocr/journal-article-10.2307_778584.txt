JOAN COPJEC . .. fast-footed and lithe of wing, she is a terrifying enormous monster with as many feathers as she has sleepless eyes beneath each feather (amazingly), as many sounding tongues and mouths, and raises up as many ears. Between the earth and skies she flies by night screeching across the darkness, and she never closes her eyes in gentle sleep. By day she sits as sentinel on some steep roof or on high towers, frightening vast cities; for she holds fast to falsehood and distortion as often as to messages of truth. Now she was glad. She filled the ears of all with many tales. She sang of what was done and what was fiction. .. .1 "She" is Fama. The personification of rumor or report, of gossip, swiftest of all evils. Rumor, "whose life is speed, whose going gives her force"-a "cur- sory contraption."2 She appears in Book IV of Virgil's Aeneid, and although her context is a "miracled up" world of endless personifications in which the simple dawning of day must pass through the rosy fingers of Aurora, she, this descrip- tion of her, never became naturalized in my reading of the Aeneid. She has always remained for me a riddling point in the text, curious and compelling. Foremost among her curiosities is her sex. How is it that Fama is a woman? How is it that gossip (even in its etymology gossip, which means godmother, is 1. The Aeneid of Virgil, trans. Allen Mandelbaum, New York, Bantam Books, 1971. 2. I have borrowed the last two phrases in quotation from President Schreber.</page><page sequence="2">OCTOBER sexed), is provided with a gender which is feminine? What mechanism makes femininity the insistent truth of Rumor's confounding of falsehood and truth? Virgil was a very careful, very slow writer. He spent eleven years writing the Aeneid, which remained uncompleted at his death. Eleven years, and perhaps several days of it on this one description of Rumor's instantaneous nar- ration, to narrate the events of Aeneas's journey from Troy to the Lavinian shores. On one level it is clear that Rumor is a device, the apparatus that Virgil uses for the specific purpose of turning the narrative, of getting from one point to the next, of bringing to the vengeful King Iarbas the knowledge of Dido's and Aeneas's tryst. But it is evident that however hostile Virgil is in his descrip- tion of Rumor, the tale that he himself "sings" is intimately, integrally related to the one she "sings." The fact that he fails to provide a description of her head ("her head is hidden in the clouds") contributes to the suggestion that he is averting the recognition of himself in her, for from analytic observation we know that the dreamer dreams of himself when he dreams of a person whose head he cannot see.3 What, then, is the relationship of gossip to narrative? Paranoid. Fama (from the Latinfari, to speak) is the paranoid projection, the delusional form of the narrative itself, a defense against the madness with which speech threatens the speaker. This observation has to do not simply with the fact that the image of Fama, that is, of eyes, tongues, mouths, ears, and feathers, is the resolution into its elements of the complex of operations that we call narrative. As opposed to hysteria, which condenses, paranoia decomposes.4 It produces, according to Lacan, "imagos of the fragmented body." 5 The observation has more to do with the fact that Fama appears at a point where the narration has reason to doubt its own omniscience, its own position as source of knowledge. There has been a complete withdrawal by the couple, Dido and Aeneas, of libido from the out- side world onto each other, a regression to narcissism. The "fault" which occurs as a result is not only moral, belonging to Dido, but is also cognitive, or better glottic, belonging to the narrative. It should be unable to continue, but instead it begins again with a jolt, with what Schreber would have called a "miracle of howling." A cry is torn from the throat of the narrative which reattaches it to the events of the world. I have chosen to recall this passage from the Aeneid because its remarkable image of gossip is a hypostasized image of speech, an intrusion which is simultaneously the very substance of the narrative, its own link with itself. She is also a kind of makeshift resolution of an epistemological problem for the nar- 3.

Since it is this relation with which the theory of the cinematic apparatus, through Lacanian psychoanalysis, is centrally concerned, she will serve throughout this essay as a reference that locates many of the strands of the discussion. A consideration of The Cinematic Apparatus, which is devoted to this theory, should, perhaps, begin by addressing the book directly in dialogue. This is the procedure sanctioned by long philosophical tradition and its belief in the ultimate powers of reason. But all too often, because of the elaborate defenses and sidestepping reason allows to the ego, this method proves a failure. It is in order to break through these defenses that the analytic maieutic, as Lacan says, must adopt a different strategy. Must instead unleash the aggressive tendencies renounced by philosophical reason by "inducing in the subject a controlled paranoia."6 I will therefore begin not in the ordinary straightforward manner, but with a slight digression, a slight turning away from reason into the paranoid regions of gossip. Those of you who take for granted the connection between women and gossip will not be surprised (will think it is perfume and a dress that make me so digress) by this strategy; those of you who do not will look to my argument. The Cinematic Apparatus is a collection of essays which consists of papers selected from among those read at, and those in response to, a conference whose full title was "The Cinematic Apparatus: Technology as Historical and Ideological Form." The conference was the subject of much controversy. Vociferous opposition-which precipitated a boycott of the conference- preceded and followed its occurrence. Although the charges of this opposition were manifestly leveled at the organization of the conference, it is clear that it was its subject (defined by the opposition as Lacanian psychoanalysis) that was the primary object of hostility. For finally the accusation was that the con- ference's manifest organization was designed to hide its latent content- Lacanian psychoanalysis. The means of obfuscation, or so the argument im- plies, was language. The whole attack, then, becomes organized around the charge of elitism and the whole defense becomes an attempt to open the dark corners of language to the clear light of day, to restore an "elitist" discourse to its ties with "common" language. Symptomatic of the fear of elitism (the "heightened feeling of exclusion") and the vain nostalgia for the common is the anxiety that surrounds the use of the word suture and the consequent attempts to dispel its influence by returning it to its common use in medical-surgical discourse.7 6.

Here I am referring specifically to the strategy employed in "Report on a Conference Not Attended: The Scalpel Beneath the Suture,"Jump Cut, vol. 17, pp. 37-38. 45</page><page sequence="4">OCTOBER If this analysis is becoming somewhat cumbersome and roundabout, it is, I would suggest, because it is carrying around and thus being diverted by a dichotomy that misses the point. To examine the resistance to psychoanalytic discourse in terms of the opposition between elitist and common language is to miss recognizing that "it may well be that . . . the polemical opposition, the systematic non-understanding and misrepresentation, the unsubstantial but eternally recurrent objections are the displaced symptoms of a resistance in- herent in the theoretical enterprise itself."8 The essay by Paul de Man from which this quotation is taken is structured around the refrain "the resistance to theory is a resistance to." The phrase is completed in several ways throughout the text so that the resistance to theory is the resistance to "language itself," to "the rhetorical dimension of language," and to "reading." These substitutions are made possible through de Man's argument which distinguishes between the grammatical/logical and the rhetorical aspects of language-although if one follows the argument it is clear that what is at stake is not an aspect, but a con- cept of language. To extend the terms of de Man's text, it can be said that the grammatical/logical concept of language presupposes a point outside language from which it can be manipulated and where it precipitates meaning. The grammatical and logical aspects lend themselves to an instrumentalist concept of language, make it a matter of a coding and decoding of messages. The rhetorical suspends the assurances of the instrumentalist concept by making reading a process that takes place within language itself and not comfortably outside it. The relevant opposition for our discussion is this one between the in- strumentalist and the rhetorical (or structural) concept of language. It is the definition of this rhetorical concept, the way it is related to the concept of suture, and the anxiety it induces that is the concern of this essay. Unfortunately, The Cinematic Apparatus cannot serve completely as its own adequate introduction. Heath's introductory essay, "Technology as Historical and Cultural Form," serves very well in the delineation of the concept of the ap- paratus. It explains how the concept breaks from notions of technological determination, how within the theory of cinema itself (particularly in the work of Metz) the technological was redefined and brought to the fore. But as Heath discusses the work of Barry Salt as another example (ultimately) of a base/superstructure model of the history of film technology, we are reminded of another of Heath's essays, "On Suture." This essay also defines Salt's position within current film theoretical debates, but this time in terms of his relation to the concept of suture, his blindness to its multiple functioning and its far- reaching importance. The connection between these two essays is not in the chance occurrence of Salt's name in both, but in the fact that the concept of suture is crucial to the concept of the apparatus, as, obversely, Salt's refusal of 8. Paul de Man, "The Resistance to Theory," Yale French Studies, no. 63 (1982), 13. 46</page><page sequence="5">The Anxiety of the Influencing Machine the one is to his refusal of the other. The base/superstructure model makes the superstructure the mirror reflection of the base, its adequate, identical image. The base subsumes and names all the superstructural phenomena that are its products. It contains them so that the two, base and superstructure, together form a closed system. This model turns on the assumption that one presence directly effects another; the base, for example, directly effects the superstruc- ture. The immediacy of the link makes the relationship indexical (as well as iconic). To say that there is an identity between two terms, two presences, is to say that nothing (no truth) has essentially been lost in the transfer from one to the other. The concept of suture interrupts the relationship between these terms. All presences are seen as the representation of the absence, or pure diacriticality to which they are continuously referred back and which they must continuously annul. Although Jacques-Alain Miller elaborates the concept of suture for Lacan- ian psychoanalysis through Frege's theory of numbers, he disfigures Frege's theory by adding to it what it had explicitly excluded-the subject. Thus Miller breaks with the tradition of logicians within which Frege worked who set themselves the task of explaining how it is possible for one thing to stand for another, how a sign could represent something to someone. Miller (and Lacan) oppose this tradition with the famous formulation "a signifier represents a sub- ject to another signifier." Against the logical tradition that conceives of representation as a process of substitution which preserves itself against loss, Lacanians see representation as an effect of a displacement, a deviation which also entails an irretrievable loss. There is no question of something standing for something else since the "something else" has no content, no existence as such before representation. The question becomes what conditions meaning, how do purely differential markings assume an identity, rather than how does one thing stand for another. The theory of the apparatus takes suture into account by analyzing the way it takes place; it does not (and must not) itself suture. The analyst (and by this we also mean the film analyst) is "by definition, the person who 'does not suture!"'9 Eventually we will want it to be clear how not suturing is equivalent to inducing paranoia when it is a question of an analyst's function. "Suture names the relation of the subject to the chain of its discourse."10 It is an account of the subject's, of meaning's coming into being through two different operations. The one is called "alienation" and refers to the fact that the subject is divided from (or lacking in) its own cause (that is, language), since 9.

Lacan terms this the aphanisis of the subject, its disappearance. It is difficult to describe the other operation, separation, since it seems in- extricably bound up, in Lacan's exposition of it, in a complex of puns. The clearest thing one can say about it is that it is paronomastic. The subject pro- cures itself as a pun on its own absence. Se parare, to separate, becomes se parer, to deck oneself out, defend oneself, to parry, and finally (through Latin, that is, through parturition) s'engendrer, to engender. "A lack engendered from the previous time" (that is, the disappearance that language imposes on the sub- ject) "serves to reply to" (is offered by the subject as the object of) "the lack raised by the following time" (the desire, or lack which the subject perceives in the language of another). In short, one lack (desire, the lack in the sexual drive) is superimposed on another (the lack in the chain of signifiers that constitute language). The subject appears at a point which occults its own disappearance. Lacan also presents this two-fold process of the constitution of the subject as the production of a metaphor. He describes the process algebraically in the "for- mula of the metaphor or of signifying substitution."'' By describing it, instead, as the production of a pun, I wish, by recalling that the pun has been termed "la fiente de l'esprit qui vole," 12 to block any misunderstanding which might con- fuse Lacan's definition of metaphor with the classical definition from which it differs profoundly. The meaning which accrues in the Lacanian metaphor is purloined, not borrowed, transferred, earned, or in any sense owned by it, the subject. Nor is it owned by some other. When Lacan says that there is no Other of the Other, he means that there is no transcendent place, no elsewhere where meaning resides. Meaning is not something which is taken from someplace else, but is the effect of a feint, a parrying, or putting off of the recognition that the subject is itself only a signifier, only an effect of language. The relata of the metaphor are not embraced by a larger field of meaning as in classical theory, rather a radical and founding rupture divorces them and disrupts any notion of analogy. Yet the feints do not end here. In another essay Lacan employs a pun which is strikingly similar to the ones he uses in the exposition of separation. Separation, as we have said, is the operation in which the subject, turning away from its own mortality with respect to language, is constituted as a desir- ing, that is, a sexual being. In "The Partial Drive and Its Circuits," Lacan says that this sexuality is constituted, that is, separation is accomplished by the bringing into play of what, in the body, deserves to be designated 11.

This is the problem posed by the theory of sexual difference which says that the process of decking oneself out, fitting oneself up, is not sexually undifferentiated, and does not exclude but defines (sexual difference) and is defined by (the phallus) "that with which bodies may be paired off." So, although the constitution of the subject has been and can be described as a general, sexually undifferentiated process, this is only so on the condition that the male subject be allowed to stand as the norm. Let us now go back and replace all the sexual signifiers that were left out in the previous discussion. Alienation, for example, is assimilable to castration; the anxiety it produces can be allayed by locating oneself as the point of desire, by representing oneself as, and thus annulling, the lack which would annul. But desire, we are told, is masculine, since the penis, the means of representing lack, is only available to the boy. And the formula of the metaphor: S. s) s x s in which the capital Ss are signifiers, x the unknown signification, and the small s the signified which is the result of the metaphoric process, that is, the elision of S (represented here by the bar which passes through it)-- is fitted out to become the paternal metaphor: 14 Name-of-the-Father Desire of the Mother Name-of-the-Father ( 0 ) Desire of the Mother Signified to the subject Phallus Now it seems to me that something has changed, from the first to the sec- ond formula. The first says that one signifier appears to take the place of another when it elides the recognition of the fact that this other is merely a signifier. As a result there is a passage from the unknown x to the known s, or meaning (not a passage from a known to another known, an annexing through analogy of the unknown by the already known). But the signified which results is never exactly coincident with or adequate to the signifier. The signifier can never take place "over" the signified because the 1, the mark of the difference (that is, also that which is left over when the signified is subtracted from the signifiers), prevents it by occupying that place. What makes the second for- 13. Lacan, "The Partial Drive and Its Circuit," The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis, London, Hogarth Press, 1977, p. 177. 14. Lacan, "On the possible treatment," p. 200. 49</page><page sequence="8">OCTOBER mula more problematic is its substitution of semantic units for signifiers on the left-hand side of the equation. Lacan may seem to protect himself from criticism by leaving the "signified to the subject" unspecified and unknown, by making the Name-of-the-Father respond not to any real absence of the father, but to the inadequacy of the signifier. And yet there is no denying that Lacan makes this equation work through the semantic difference between mother and father. He restores semantic difference to the left side not as an effect, but as a cause, by making the elision of the Desire of the Mother not an operation per- formed on a signifier, but a perception of that signifier's meaning, that it is elided, is wounded. In this way the chiasmatypy (the process by which the purely diacritical relationship between two terms in an opposition is crossed out and the two terms given meaning retroactively through their opposition to two other terms in another opposition) which is required by a structural definition of signification is reduced to analogy (in which the difference is significant at the beginning and merely extended to the next opposition). The decussation that takes place among the four terms (again, in a structural definition) is brought to bear here only on one, the mother who is decussed at first sight. Meaning, then, comes to exist outside and prior to metaphor rather than within the operation of metaphor itself. This is opposed to Lacan's own theory of the relation of language to the unconscious: the unconscious is structured like a language. How are we to un- derstand this structure as like a language? In no easy way, since if we begin, like Lacan, with a structural definition of language, we strip "like," analogy, of its power to ground meaning. It is more accurate to say that language is the precondition of the unconscious, in the sense that language allows the un- conscious to come into being as well as that it alone allows us access to (an understanding of) the workings of the unconscious. There is not first language which signifies to the subject and then the unconscious formed as a resem- blance to it, rather the formation of the unconscious is simultaneous with the accession to language, the process in which language becomes significant. The unconscious is formed through the repression (the elision) not of some idea, some signified, but of the signifier as signifier, the fact of its existence in the Other. Thus, repression "neither repels, nor flees, nor excludes an exterior force: it contains an interior representation."15 The description of the psychic apparatus which follows from this (not only in Derrida, but in Freud and Lacan as well) is not of a mechanism that transports contents back and forth between consciousness and the unconscious, but of two systems, one of memory, a system of pure signifiers, and the other of conscious perceptions, signifieds-neither one the analogue of the other. The unconscious is like a 15. Jacques Derrida, "Freud and the Scene of Writing," Writing and Difference, trans.

Both are involved with the production of meaning and not the simple exchange of already constituted meanings. One will find in The Cinematic Apparatus, in the contributions of de Lauretis and Rose, critiques of the notions of analogy and exchange and of the way they reduce the theory of the apparatus. Beginning with the notion that it is the already meaningful male apparatus, the penis, with which cinema fits itself up, takes shape, that is, beginning with the notion that the form of the penis is somehow immediately meaningful, the cinematic apparatus has nothing left to do but to endlessly reproduce and exchange, like a printing press, this same shape. The phallus is the privileged signifier because it is the most tangible element in the real of sexual copulation, and also the most symbolic in the literal (typographical) sense, since it is equivalent there to the (logical) copula. It might be said that, by virtue of its turgidity, it is the image of the vital flow as it is transmitted in generation.16 Again, in all fairness to Lacan, it must be admitted that his theory is one of the main loci of the development of a nonreferential concept of representa- tion and that he has often denied that the phallus is either the penis or any other organ or object. The phallus is always theorized in relation to desire, to the logic by which the absolute condition of demand annuls all satisfaction which answers to need and produces desire as a residue. In this connection it is less the ideal form of the penis than its alternating tumescence and detumescence (or presence and absence) that insures it as the referent of the phallus. That is, the penis is privileged because it is taken to represent the phallus as gram- matical or logical function. However circuitous this route, it is founded still on a notion of immediate resemblance and therefore does not avoid the problem of analogocentrism which turns this theory (and that of the cinematic apparatus) away from the concept of suture, which is its radical premise, and causes it to fall prey to paranoia. Lacan's formula of the paternal metaphor (which, as we have said, con- travenes the classical notion of language only to slide, through analogy, back into it) is contained in the essay, "On a question preliminary to any possible treatment of psychosis." This essay is concerned with paranoid delusions, par- ticularly Schreber's, and with Freud's analysis of them, particularly in his essay, "On the Mechanism of Paranoia." In his essay Lacan pays homage not only to Freud, but also to Schreber by recognizing in Freud's theory and in Schreber's delusions forerunners of his own. Yet even in the respect he pays 16. Lacan, "The signification of the phallus," Ecrits, p. 287. 51</page><page sequence="10">OCTOBER Schreber, he is following Freud, who recognized in the "rays of God" his own theory of the libido: It remains for the future to decide whether there is more delusion in my theory than I should like to admit, or whether there is more truth in Schreber's delusion than other people are as yet prepared to believe. 17 We will leave aside this question of the relation of paranoia to theory and look instead to paranoia's relation to language. Lacan tells us that it was an early study of paranoia that led him to the threshold of psychoanalysis and we know from his theory that this means that he was led to the recognition of the primacy of the signifier. Anyone who suspects that Lacan, in rereading Freud in terms of linguistic theory, is distort- ing him would do well to read Freud on paranoia. One finds there a linguistic analysis that defines all the principal forms of paranoia as the representations of the different ways that the single proposition "I (a man) love him (a man)" can be contradicted. After Freud we should not be surprised by Lacan's focusing on Schreber's dictum: "Do not forget that the nature of the rays is that they speak," nor his analysis of Schreber's delusions in these terms: "What is involved here, in fact, is an effect of the signifier in so far as its degree of certainty . . assumes a weight proportional to the enigmatic void that first presents itself in the place of the signification itself."18 But what is most interesting is the similarity between the theory of paranoia and Lacan's theory of the constitution (through alienation and separation) of the subject. Basically psychoanalysis defines paranoia as a defense against homosex- uality. There are two primary pathogenic factors involved. First there is a total detachment of libido from the outside world. Then the detached libido reat- taches itself to and aggrandizes the ego, thereby forcing a regression to nar- cissism. (The Schreber case is what, in 1911, forced Freud's discovery of nar- cissism, which was not to be developed as a concept until 1919.) As a result the subject experiences its own withdrawal of libidinal cathexis from, as the catastrophic end of, the external world.19 Until this point, Freud tells us, the illness proceeds silently, internally. What brings it to the attention of others is the attempt at recovery. The paranoiac tries to recapture a relation to the exter- nal world by building a world up again. The systematized delusions, then, are not the pathological product, but "miracled up, cursory contraptions" which 17. Freud, p. 182. 18. Lacan, "On the possible treatment," p. 185. 19. At this point in his discussion, Freud includes a footnote in which he compares the paranoiac experience of "the end of the world" to that of lovers in their moment of ecstasy: "[I]n this case it is not the ego but the single love-object which absorbs all the cathexes directed upon the external world." He cites Wagner's Tristan and Isolde, but he might just as well have included Virgil's Dido and Aeneas. 52</page><page sequence="11">The Anxiety of the Influencing Machine reconstruct a world and reattach the libido. In the process, from illness to at- tempted recovery, the original proposition has been contradicted and a loving relation to the external world is reversed into its opposite, becomes hostile. Freud did not solve in the theory of paranoia all the problems that presented themselves there. He could never satisfactorily explain, for example, the mechanism of projection. This will not concern us here. But we must pay at least passing attention to one problem that the theory of paranoia raised for Freudian psychoanalysis. The discovery of a libidinal cathexis of the ego threatened to destroy the opposition between sexual and self-preservation, or ego instincts upon which (at this time) depended the theory of psychical conflict. In this Freud was in opposition to Jung and his theory of instinctual monism. Although Freud would revise several times his description of instinc- tual dualism (and even abandon it for a short period), his psychical model is resolutely conflictual. This is indeed one of the features that makes the theory attractive to a progressive politics. Even though Freud says here that the strug- gle between life and death instincts is only a hypothesis "which we have taken up and are ready to drop again," we witness his concern that the distinction be kept. Lacan keeps it and nowhere more visibly than in "The mirror stage as for- mative of the function of the I," which again takes up the question of the rela- tion of the egoistic cathexis to the rapport with the external world. Lacan here analyzes the way in which the formation of the subject's own ego from an image at a distance, an image of another, makes identification an alienation of the subject from itself, structures all human knowledge as paranoid. This aspect of Lacan's work, his making of the ego agonistic in its very formation, has been dealt with extensively and I will skip over it for the present.20 I am also more interested in moving the discussion away from the Imaginary-and the problem of the relation of knowledge to vision--to the Symbolic- and the problem of knowledge's relation to language. As Lacan's work implies, the relation of the subject to language (its alienation-separation, suturing in language), which is, in fact, its primary relation to knowledge (visual knowledge is secondary, dependent on language as all structural linguistics shows) is paranoid. But I want to speak of this in particular terms, in terms of the concept of the cinematic apparatus and so I will turn from Lacan to Victor Tausk and one of the most famous essays in psychoanalytic literature on paranoid delusions: "On the Origin of the Influencing Machine (Beeinfluss- ungapparatus) in Schizophrenia."21 20. See particularly Jacqueline Rose's interesting article, "Paranoia and the Film System," Screen, vol. 17, no. 4 (Winter 1976-77), 85-104. 21. This paper was read before and discussed by the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society inJanuary 1918, published in German in 1919, and republished in English translation in 1933 in the Psychoanalytic Quarterly. In the same volume is included an essay by Hans Sachs, "The Delay of the 53</page><page sequence="12">OCTOBER First of all, Tausk is at pains in all points of the paper to align himself with Freud's theories.22 In this he is successful, for the clinical picture he presents is consistent with that of Freud outlined above. Tausk, then, elaborates on and extends Freud through the analysis of the typical delusion of "paranoia somatica": the influencing machine. This delusional formation, which seems totally to control the patient, is formed as an attempt at a recovery of object cathexes in order to forestall the anxiety that results from the feelings of aliena- tion that plague the patient. This is Tausk's description of the influencing machine: a machine of mystical nature. The patients are able to give only vague hints of its construction. It consists of boxes, cranks, levers, wheels, buttons, wires, batteries. . . . Patients endeavor to discover the construction of the apparatus by means of their technical knowl- edge. . . . All the forces known to technology are utilized to ex- plain . . . the marvelous powers of this machine by which the pa- tients feel themselves persecuted. The main effects of the influencing machine are . . : It makes the patients see pictures. When this is the case, the machine is generally a magic lantern or cinematograph. . . .It produces, as well as removes, thoughts and feelings by means of waves or rays. ... In such cases, the machine is often called a "suggestion apparatus."23 The influencing machine is, however, only one stage in a series of pro- gressive distortions that the delusion undergoes. (Paranoia, remember, decom- poses.) From his observations of his patient Natalija A.,24 Tausk hypothesizes that the delusion begins as a projection of the patient's own body. But through Machine Age," which attempts to use Tausk's theory of the "influencing machine" of paranoid delusions to explain "why the late classical period did not invent or to any great extent use machines." It is interesting to note that the theory of the cinematic apparatus is also bound up, in the early work (see, for example, Jean-Luc Comolli's "Technique and Ideology" in Cahiers du cinema) with explanations of the delay of the machine. I regret that the necessary comparison be- tween Sachs's and Comolli's arguments, along with Derrida's, on the relation between delay and repression ("Freud and the Machine of Writing," again about the apparatus) will have to remain beyond the scope of this paper. 22. I mention the civility that characterized the relationship between Tausk and Freud to counter the biographical literature that makes of it a subject of the worst sort of gossip. Even in- veterate gossips will find the two books devoted to this relationship, Brother Animal.

We do not learn very much about Natalija except that she is a philosophy student who is deaf, and thus forced to communicate by writing. Freud has, in several essays, made a com- parison between the systems of philosophers and the delusions of paranoiacs. For my argument it is Natalija's deafness that is particularly noteworthy, for it means that through her dependence on writing she is exposed to the alterity of language which speech to some extent disguises. 54</page><page sequence="13">The Anxiety of the Influencing Machine a replacement of parts, it gradually loses all its human attributes and finally becomes the typical, unintelligible, influencing machine. Immediately after offering this hypothesis, he suggests a second, seemingly contradictory one: the influencing machine is a projection of the patient's genitalia. This is not supported directly from his observation of Natalija's case history, but indirectly through Freud's work on machine dreams. According to Freud, complicated machines (the influencing machines always are) represent the dreamer's genitalia. The machine becomes complicated because the dreamer progres- sively adds parts to an originally simpler machine in an attempt to strengthen the inhibition of a repudiated wish for libidinal discharge. The machine's com- plexity increases intellectual interest and thus weakens libidinal interest. Tausk then attempts to resolve these two hypotheses. Resolution is achieved through an appeal to narcissism, the stage to which the paranoiac regresses. In this stage, since the ego (which coheres in the form of the body im- age) is cathected by the liberated libido, the entire body becomes a continuous libidinal zone, a genital. We are thus assured that Tausk's theory is trustworthy. (Freud: "I shall not consider any theory of paranoia trustworthy unless it also covers the hypochondriacal symptoms by which that disorder is almost invariably accompanied."25) The direction of attention onto the ego as organ by means of the influx of libido is the mechanism of hypochondria. Finally the body is pro- jected outward in an effort to escape the feeling of isolation which is the conse- quence of this attention. Projection is the mechanism chosen because it belongs to the primary functioning of the ego in the process of object finding: The projection of one's own body may, then, be traced back to the developmental stage in which one's own body is the goal of the object finding. This must be the time when the infant is discovering his body . . . as the outer world, and is still groping for his hands and feet as though they were foreign objects. At this time, everything that "happens" to him emanates from his own body; his psyche is the object of stimuli arising in his own body but acting upon it as if pro- duced by outer objects. These disjecta membra are later on pieced together and systematized into a unified whole under the supervision of a psychic unity .... This process takes place by means of identification with one's own body.26 There circulates in this passage, around the conjoining of paranoia and nar- cissistic identification, a number of terms found in Lacan's "mirror stage," although the precise nature of the conjunction is, of course, a bit different. In Lacan, the "as if produced by outer objects" is no longer incidental or conjec- 25. Freud, p. 157. 26. Tausk, p. 542. 55</page><page sequence="14">OCTOBER tural but rather takes on a structural role in constituting the subject as a fictional object. The finding of this object, its own ego, sets the subject on its own track, as its own rival, and predisposes it to delusions of (self)reference. Identification through projection of its body, in short, produces in the subject a paranoia by splitting it from itself. Tausk's description emphasizes instead the systematization and unification of the subject. The projection of the body becomes not the cause of paranoia but a defense against it-a delusion of reference that attempts to suture a fault, to rebuild the world from which the paranoid has withdrawn. For both Lacan and Tausk the symptom of paranoia is the defaulting of the ego, its failure along the boundaries. The subject is invaded by thoughts. Tausk attempts to find a parallel between this symptom of the paranoiac and an infantile state of thinking in which the child believes the parents know even its most intimate thoughts. A footnote is inserted here indicating a contribution which Freud made to the discussion of Tausk's paper at this point. The con- tribution is, however, never properly embodied in the paper itself. Freud emphasized that the infant's conception that others knew its thoughts has its source in the process of learning to speak. Having obtained its language from others, the infant has also received thoughts from them: and the child's feeling that others know his thoughts as well as that others have 'made' him the language and, along with it, his thoughts, has, therefore, some basis in reality.27 The subject, then, this observation suggests, constructed in language, is predisposed by the reality of that construction to paranoia. My intention in citing and underlining this is to reestablish the link between paranoia and (1) language, which Lacan threatens to lose by analyzing it as a consequence of the mirror stage. We must not forget that any formulation of this phase takes place only by means of language, that the Imaginary becomes significant only from the position of the Symbolic; (2) sexual difference, which is constituted as an effect of language, of the entry into the Symbolic. For although paranoia-a defense against homosexuality that projects the body as a genital- is obviously in some way a recognition of sexual difference, there is a tendency for the theory of paranoia (which links it to the unsexed body in the mirror) to deny it. Witness, for example, the way Tausk dodges the issue. He observes that although it may be a male orfemale body that is projected by the paranoid (Freud in "A Case of Paranoia Running Counter to the Psychoanalytic Theory of That Disease," records the projection by a female patient of her clitoris), the persons who operate the influencing machine are exclusively male. Tausk recovers from this 27. Ibid., p. 536. 56</page><page sequence="15">The Anxiety of the Influencing Machine startling observation by first suggesting that it may be faulty or incomprehen- sive and then by attempting to explain it: However, that heterosexual objects can appear as persecutors in contradiction to Freud's theory of the exclusively homosexual genesis of paranoia, may be explained by the fact that the influencing machine corresponds to a regressive stage in which the important distinction is not between the sexes but between narcissistic and ob- ject libido.28 The slip is obvious; no matter how you slice it, "always male" is not the same as "irrespective of sex"; and (3) the concept of the cinematic apparatus as it relates to language and sexual difference. One wonders whether a particular hypochon- driacal theory of the apparatus -which projects the image of a phallic machine reproducing only male spectators -might not be the delusional defense against the alienation that the elaboration of cinema as a language opened in the theory. Just as one wonders what relation the theory of sexual difference has, in general, to the alienation of the subject in language. That is, according to the theory of suture, all subjects are subjects of alienation, experience castration. According to the theory of sexual difference, only women do-men are merely threatened by it. I do not want to deny that there are constructions of sexual difference, nor do I mean to say that those who perceive sexual prejudice against women are paranoid, but that the theory is which anthropomorphizes a social formation. It is this theory of the way difference is constructed that we must question. And yet this questioning-of the construction of subject positions, sexual difference -can only begin with the theory of the cinematic apparatus. I do not mean to contradict myself, but to point out that our one word in English, ap- paratus, corresponds in French to two, appareil (apparatus, machine, device, camera) and dispositif (also apparatus or device, but primarily arrangement). The English titles of two of Baudry's essays-"The Ideological Effects of the Basic Cinematographic Apparatus" and "The Apparatus"-disguise the fact that appareil is replaced in the second by dispositif. There is strategy in this. Ap- pareil is usually used in a mechanical or anatomical sense, attached to an organ of reproduction. Dispositif can be used to signal an adherence to a philosophical tradition which includes, among others, Bachelard, Canguilhem, Foucault, which sets itself against the empiricist position that facts exist outside the science that discovers them. According to this theory-of the apparatus, or phenomeno-technics, or veridical discourses - truths are internal to the signify- ing practices that construct them. There are many implications of this theory, but for now all we are con- 28. Ibid., p. 553. 57</page><page sequence="16">OCTOBER cerned with is how it opposes the appareil (or paranoid) theory of the apparatus. One of its main effects is the elimination of any support for a misreading of suture in terms of analogy, as a role model theory of socialization. It says that there are no fully constructed subjects or objects outside discourse which must then be integrated into a social structure. Nor is there any unified subject or ob- ject outside discourse that governs it. The subject is, instead, simultaneously constituted and dislocated by speech. This means that the forms that discourses take are not expressions of a last instance, a sovereignty which maintains and reproduces itself through these discourses. To determine the conditions of ex- istence of a particular discourse is not to reduce these conditions to a monolithic edifice nor to reduce their relation to the discourses that follow from them to one of analogy. What the theory of dispositif allows for feminists is a grounds for the cri- tique of the concept of patriarchy. It allows us to question the anthropomorphic power it assumes, the functionalism it exhibits. Patriarchy can only be an effect of a particular arrangement of competing discourse, not an expressive totality which guarantees its own self-interests. From here we can begin to extricate the concept of castration from the same tendency to conceive of sexual identity as something that is learned from a role model. The category of the structural un- conscious intervenes in any attempt to establish identity as an isomorphism be- tween apprentice and master, as submission to a master image. If we are to take Lacan's critique of ego psychology seriously, we cannot accept castration as a means of enforcing adaptation to a social norm. The solution, however, seems not to be to discard castration altogether, for it is this concept which al- lows the analysis of the radical constitution of difference. Nor can we allow the categories of sexual difference - of masculinity or femininity - to synthesize an ensemble of multiple effects into unified opposing fields. What must be analyzed is the way particular discourses inscribe sexual differences, different subject posi- tions. We must examine woman as a category that is produced in various signi- fying practices not to be confused with some biological entity outside them. Mary Ann Doane, for example, has examined the way various theoretical practices describe femininity in terms of immediacy and simultaneity as op- posed to masculinity which is described in terms of distance from the self.29 We have seen that Virgil has distanced himself from Fama through this same strategic polarity. The contemplative masculine position negates at the same time as it preserves the knowledge secured from the "swiftest" and hence "evil" feminine one. Other practices produce other polarities. What is important is that the range of these polarities be recognized and kept separate. As they are collapsed together they tend, in their collectivity, to imply a single, un- 29.

It is only by becoming attentive to the multiformity of the constructions of sexual difference that we will avoid this error. This error, I am implying, threatens the theory of the cinematic ap- paratus. It threatens to jettison the radical potential of the concept of the dispositif in favor of the hypochondria of a unified male body image. In pointing to this central shifting between appareil and dispositif in the theory of the ap- paratus, I have merely duplicated the strategy that informs the organization of The Cinematic Apparatus, which frames the conference papers in theoretical ques- tions of this sort. This frame should enable the reader to look on critically as the apparatus is defined in the various papers (to query, for example, the use of an unproblematized notion of ideology--as though it were unified and/or con- scious) and to form some idea of the history of its development. The earliest formulations of the theory of the cinematic apparatus were fascinated with the conceptual leap that allowed Niepce to invent the photographic process. Cinema was tied at this point, and in the later considera- tion of the temporary disappearance of deep focus, to an analogy with the photographic image. At about the same time as the photographic process was invented, Charles Babbage, "father of the computer," invented the analytical engine, a kind of prototype of the paranoiac's influencing machine. A reading of Hugh Kenner's The Counterfeiters will make clear the empiricism that condi- tioned these inventions which defined things in terms of their function or ob- served fitness for function and forbid knowledge to extend beyond the senses. Clearly it is a mistake for the theory of the apparatus to become confused with the same empirical thinking that conditioned these inventions-to become em- broiled in the massive and paranoid fears of fraud ("frightening vast cities" with threats of "falsehood and distortion") to which empirical concepts inevitably lead. It is a theory of dispositif that promises to lead us beyond the impasse that accompanies the appeal to an ultimate reality. 59</page></plain_text>
