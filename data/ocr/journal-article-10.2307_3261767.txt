<plain_text><page sequence="1">WOLFSON'S PHILO ERWIN R. GOODENOUGH YALE UNIVERSITY FEW scholars these days try to produce anything which could be called a magnum opus. Wolfson is one of the few; and when it is remembered that the two large volumes before usT represent a relatively small part of his total undertaking, he must be put into the forefront of even that little group. For it is Wolfson's plan to present a history of philosophy which will begin with at least one volume on the Greeks, then consider Philo as here, then give the whole development of philosophy in Christian, Islamic, and Jewish circles of the Middle Ages, and finally show the beginnings of the new age where Spinoza breaks the pattern of medieval thought and returns to the Greek approach. Wolfson believes that medieval philosophy had a distinctive character because it had a distinctive source of knowledge quite foreign to both the Greek and modern thinkers, the source we usually call "revelation," but which Wolfson calls the "preamble of faith" (p. v). The moderns, like the Greeks, try by observation, hypothesis, and intuition, whatever these words mean, to discover the truth about the nature of man, and the nature of his environment up to and including God himself. The medieval world had to square all such data of "reason" with the data of their inspired Scriptures where the answers were all given. More than this, the medievalists had to square their reasons with a philosophical tradition which determined how Scripture itself was to be interpreted, Wolfson says, for in I Harry Austryn Wolfson, Philo: Foundations of Religious Philosophy in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (Structure and Growth of Philosophic Systems from Plato to Spinoza, II).

These inflexible principles, Wolfson continues in his Preface, were all worked out by none other than Philo himself, and so "the philo- sophy of Philo" came to be "the most dominant force in the history of philosophy down to the seventeenth century." Even as ardent a Philonist as myself must blink at so great a claim for our hero. That the Philonic school, or hellenized Judaism, was one of the most important formative influences in the making of Christianity; that it set a tendency and method whose elaboration does distinguish medieval thought from the thinking of ancient and modern times; that this was largely a requirement to hold reason within the limits of revealed religion- these seem to me clearly indisputable, though medieval thinkers steadily forced so much into the words of Scripture that the "limits of revealed religion" became highly debatable entities. Wolfson, however, wants to go farther and to see in a single "set of inflexible principles," a single "philosophy," that of Philo, the dominating force in all later medieval thinking. Wolfson's volumes on Philo attempt to show how this "philosophy," these "inflexible principles," came into existence in the mind of one who was, Wolfson says (I, 114) "a philosopher in the grand manner." The volumes on Philo are so impressive as they stand on the shelves, and as one reads their amazingly detailed exposition, that already it is being said on many sides that the "definitive" work on Philo has at last appeared. Since Philo is (or should be) carefully studied by NT scholars as well as by historians of Judaism, it is well to give the work a closer scrutiny than is allowed in an ordinary review. Wolfson approaches his task with what seems to be an inex- haustible knowledge of the writings of all ancient and medieval writers. Out of this universe he has come to abstract elements common to all these writers which he is right in seeing brought together for the first time in Philo's writings. Wolfson takes this preconceived distillation of medieval philosophers, and find- ing most of it in Philo he calls it "Philo" himself. Philo is to him 88</page><page sequence="3">GOODENOUGH: WOLFSON S PHILO the dramatic point where revelation entered to dominate reason. And the revelation which came into Western thought through Philo seems for Wolfson to be specifically Jewish revelation. What Wolfson is really demonstrating is that medieval thought began with the confluence of Greek and Jewish points of view. In this large issue Philo the person is quite secondary. For, to go back a step farther, in Philo there joined with Greek rationalism (as Wolfson considers the Greek stream to be) a Judaism which Wolfson seems to have learned not from Philo at all but from rabbinical tradition which he interprets much as George Foote Moore did. Moore's "normative" Juda- ism seems to have become Wolfson's less fortunate "native" Judaism,2 but it is still the same condensation of halachic rab- binism as that which Moore represented as a norm in the thinking of all Jews from the time of Ezra, or shortly afterwards, to the present. This tradition included, of course, the notion that all human thought and conduct must be regulated by the divinely inspired Torah. It included much more; and Wolfson will have us believe that the Judaism of Philo is, in amazing detail, the Judaism of "native Jewish tradition." So in two introductory chapters Wolfson describes the formation of the Diaspora; how Jews went out with their Bibles and "native Jewish tradition," 2 "Native Jewish tradition" as a word for halachic (with a little haggadic) rabbinical tradition seems to me even more unfortunate than Moore's "norma- tive," because at least the word "normative" meant something. I suspect Wolfson himself would deny either meaning I have been able to construe for the term "native," but confess I cannot guess what meaning he would give it. For I can see only two possible meanings: 1. That it is the religion of those who are "native Jews" in the sense of having been born of Jewish parents. But the extreme variety of native Jewish belief in this sense robs the term of any specific meaning. Philo was as well born a native Jew as Akiba. 2. That it is a tradition natively produced within Judaism, and with no accretions from the outside. But such a Judaism never existed. Canaanite influence, Syrian influence, Babylonian influence, Persian influence (I dare not mention Greek influence), all these came in to color even the strictest rabbinic thought. If the "tradition" has many non-Jewish ancestors, and many Jews did not hold the tradition, it is perplexing to know in what sense it is "native." As Wolfson uses it, it means Moore's normative Judaism, or rabbinic Judaism, made to include, if need be, a touch here and there from apocryphal, gnomic, and apocalyptic literatures. 89</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE and were attracted by the systematic reasoning of classical Greek philosophers (especially Plato and Aristotle), but imposed upon that reasoning the theistic points of view of revealed Judaism, the halachic respect for law as statute, the hatred of polytheism and idolatry, and Jewish eschatology. In such an approach to Philo one sees steadily at work the mind of a person who recognizes kinship between Philo and that tradition at places where an ordinary reader would (and could) never do. Consequently these details take on an engrossing importance for Wolfson; they make him stress "native" details out of pro- portion to their place in Philo's thinking, and blind him to the very existence of much in Philo which has a character quite foreign to "native Judaism." As a consequence Wolfson at no place prepares the reader to find in Philo a writer who reads as a whole so utterly unlike either Plato or the rabbis. Granted that Philo is writing Jewish midrash, his Allegories, or the writings in his Exposition, are startlingly unlike the Tannaitic Midrashim of which Wolfson makes so much use. Wolfson sees in Philo so many details which resemble details of rabbinic tradition, and so completely ignores the Jewish details which are unlike it, that he misses entirely the dissimilar totality. From the Greek side Philo's writings are just as little to be described as Plato and Aristotle imposed upon Jewish midrash. For from this side too the presence of strikingly Platonic and Aristotelian elements and individual ideas blinds Wolfson to what has been recently more and more apparent, that the whole Greek manner of thinking in Philo, certainly his manner of presenting non-Jewish ideas, is as foreign to the rationalism of Plato and Aristotle as it is to the manner or matter of the Tannaitic Midrashim. That is, anyone trained in Plato and Aristotle, and familiar with rabbinic literature, but who had not read Philo, could not but be completely convinced by Wolfson's study. For here de- tailed similarities between quotations from Philo and quotations from these Greek and Jewish sources accumulate almost in- finitely, and conviction comes with the accumulation. If, how- ever, the same reader then turned to Philo himself, and from Philo to such writings on Philo as those of Conybeare, Pascher, 90</page><page sequence="5">GOODENOUGH: WOLFSON'S PHILO and others, he would be puzzled indeed to find a Philo, com- pletely documented and dominant, to whose thinking Wolfson alludes only in his introductory chapters where he hurriedly denies his existence. Wolfson tells us at the beginning (I, 36-55) that he finds no mysticism, no kinship to the mystery religions, in Philo: I suspect that he does so because except in these few pages of special pleading Wolfson ignores all Philo's mysticism and mystical conceptions. On this section we must stop a moment. Wolfson begins by pointing out what has commonly been recognized by all students of Philo, that Philo abhorred and denounced Greek worship, mysteries, and mythologies, in spite of the fact that he often used the vocabulary of the mysteries, and made literary allu- sions to the myths. No one has ever suggested, to my knowl- edge, that Philo accepted Greek or Egyptian mythology or cultus as such. The real issue is the vocabulary of the mysteries: did Philo use it "as he uses terms borrowed from popular reli- gion and from mythology, all of them because they were part of common speech" (I, 46), as Wolfson thinks, that is stripped of any literal meaning; or did he "identify, by means of allegory, the religion of Scripture with the religion of the mysteries," so that "thereby 'Judaism was at once transformed into the great- est, the only true, Mystery' " (I, 45, quoting from my By Light, Light, 7)? It must at once be admitted that Philo would agree with Wolfson in repudiating such a statement as representing what he was trying to do. "Identify the religion of Scripture with the religion of the mysteries" would have been fighting words to Philo. For in this Wolfson shows how completely he misses the point of all who see a real similarity between Philo's religious thinking and that of such people as Plutarch and Apuleius and the later Neo-Platonists like Proclus. Mystic Judaism was not, to Philo, just another mystery religion, to be "identified" with the others. Rather it was, to Philo, in sharpest contrast to them. Philo did "identify" (Wolfson's term, not mine) the two in that he took the concepts of the mysteries over as living forces and ideals into his Judaism, but he did so quite uncon- sciously, and would indignantly have denied that he did so. 91</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE "The more they borrowed, the more they must seem to them- selves to repudiate" is a statement I have used elsewhere as the key to the fact that such people as Philo both borrow and re- pudiate. Because Philo would undoubtedly have denied with anger any suggestion that he borrowed anything from hellenistic and mystic religiosity to put into Jewish tradition, Wolfson denies it for him. But in doing so he denies, as Philo would have done, much that is obviously a part of Philo just the same. So Wolfson devotes the next ten pages to discussing, or to paraphrasing, the passages where Philo speaks of Jewish religion in most directly mystic terms. If the mystic Israelites are guided to tame the passions by "some divine inspiration," that inspira- tion, Wolfson says, is "the laws of Moses," and the "practice of virtue" is itself "practice of the laws of Moses." The mystic intercourse by which God "sows and begets happiness in human souls," as Philo calls it, is to Wolfson the freedom which comes from God to one who is guided by the Law of Moses. The direct vision of God which Philo wanted to get "apart from God's Powers," and "not from created things" is knowledge of God got by revelation, that is, Wolfson explains by cross reference (II, 90) by "a direct perception of the evidence in nature for the existence of God which one may acquire with the help of God by means of prophecy and revelation." Accordingly, Wolfson asserts, men initiated into mysteries in Judaism meant to Philo "men of good native abilities and proper education who have succeeded in mastering their passions and in acquiring a true knowledge of the existence and nature of God" (I, 49). The mystic marriage, Wolfson goes on, is properly the "un- broken and constant union between God and man, for God is in a sense always in men" (I, 51). On this basis Philo rejects the heathen mysteries as mummeries, for "This is the meaning of Philo's comparison of the covenant between Israel and God to initiation into mysteries" (ibidem). When Philo demands that the Jewish mystery, its "secret cakes" and the rest, be kept secret Wolfson interprets this as a cautioning against teach- ing the methods of allegory to uneducated and immoral men. Similar cautioning, Wolfson says, is to be found in the teaching 92</page><page sequence="7">GOODENOUGH: WOLFSON'S PHILO of the rabbis, who warned against teaching widely the secret doctrines of the Chariot and of Creation (I, 55). The implication of this final comparison is that the Mysteries of the Chariot and of Creation were similar to Philonic teaching, an idea with which one may in large part agree, at least as a real possibility. But the further implication that these Mysteries were an esoteric and revered part of rabbinic Judaism itself is something quite unjustified. Of these teachings we know almost nothing except that the rabbis wanted them not only kept from popular ears, but threatened damnation even to any rabbi who would listen to them. To refer to these Mysteries as rabbinic parallels to Philo's mystic Judaism is then, to say the least, strange. To say that Philo's warnings "mean nothing more than that rule laid down by the rabbis" cannot stand for a moment. Philo was as anxious to have his mystic Judaism taught to those competent to hear them as were the rabbis to suppress the other Mysteries altogether. This is Wolfson's total exposition of the mystic elements in Philo's writings. For Philo as for hellenistic Jews in general the use of terms from mystic philosophy, like the use of terms from Greek religious practices "was a Hellenization in language only, not in belief or cult.... It did not cause them to change their conception of their own religion" (I, 13). The subject is finally dismissed without examining a single passage in its context. So throughout the two volumes he need not refer once to the "Light- Stream," never discuss the Patriarchs or their wives for their place in Philo's thinking, not once use the term v6obos ? ,tI/vXOS, or allude to the mystic celebration of the festivals. To the mystic pattern as exemplified in the migrations of Abraham and of Jacob and of Israel from Egypt Wolfson never refers, or to the miraculous babies, Isaac and Moses. Hence for all that is impressive in Wolfson's massive alignment of fragments of Philo with parallel fragments from Plato, Aristotle, and the rabbis, he has never once tried to get into step with the marching of Philo's own mind as revealed in his writings. With not the least regard for the process and sweep of Philo's own exposition, Wolfson shatters it into bits and presents us with a "Philo" by picking up what fragments he can put into a mosaic of his own design. 93</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE To Wolfson Philo must be made a systematic philosopher who produced, by uniting rabbinic Judaism with Plato and Aristotle, the dominant philosophy of the Middle Ages. So Wolfson can never leave Philo in inconsistencies on any point. "Unless we assume that Philo did not know his own mind, or that he changed his mind, a way must be found to reconcile this statement with his other statements" (I, 275). "By this interpretation of Philo we have been able to remove all apparent inconsistencies" (I, 375). "There are no inconsistencies in Philo on this point; there are only incomplete statements which have to be completed by a comparison with other statements" (I, 382). The one con- clusion about Philo on which scholars had all agreed was that Philo frequently did not "know his own mind," and just as frequently "changed" it. Wolfson's ingenuity in combining isolated passages, in "completing" statements so as to reconcile inconsistencies, brings inevitably to mind the word pilpul, an honored term in rabbinic circles for this sort of analysis. Philo himself, in reconciling statements of Scripture with each other and with Greek philosophy and mysticism, or with common sense, was one of Wolfson's few superiors in the art. Isolated instances of Wolfson's ingenuity such as appear in connection with the sentences just quoted from his book might here be given, and will appear in other connections, but a few instances cannot give the almost hypnotic force of a thousand pages of such artistry. If one reads the writings of Philo long enough one begins to wonder whether some of the mystic or philosophic notions he finds in the Torah may not have been actually in the minds of the original writers of the passages. One must be elaborately forewarned, and know the dates of much that Wolfson quotes, not to feel that Wolfson similarly is making his case. For, with all mystic possibilities a priori dismissed from Philo, Wolfson can go on to show how Philo combined rabbinic Juda- ism with classical Greek rationalism. To do this Wolfson creates a most interesting background for Philo in both Judaism and Greek philosophy. Actually Philo now appears to us as an island in the sea of antiquity, an island which must originally have been connected 94</page><page sequence="9">GOODENOUGH: WOLFSON'S PHILO with the Greek mainland on one side, and the Jewish continent on the other. But this direct connection has been submerged by the loss of documents from his contemporaries and predeces- sors in both Hellenism and Judaism. In trying to reconstruct these lost connections between Philo and his environments Wolfson has two distinct methods, one of which he uses for the Greek relations of Philo, the other for the Jewish. On the Greek side Philo has seemed to all his recent students who know hellenistic philosophy in its mystic, Neo-Platonic, and Neo-Pythagorean developments to belong essentially with those schools. True we know these schools almost entirely from writers who lived after Philo. We have not a single document from a Platonist or Aristotelian after Aristotle (except Philo himself) until we get to the little Introduction of Albinus, over a century after Philo, and then to the great new world of Plotinus. All other schools of philosophy before Philo are similarly repre- sented only by fragments, except for the little pseudo-Aristotelian De Mundo. Tradition which has gathered about the name of Plotinus' teacher puts the beginning of Neo-Platonism well back into the second century, but that is at least a century after the death of Philo. Cicero shows us some aspects of hellenistic thinking before Philo, and Seneca and Plutarch just after Philo. True, Plutarch approaches religious problems in a way to re- mind us often of Philo, but Philo obviously could not have read Plutarch, who was born about the year Philo must have died. After Plotinus comes the bewildering age of Porphyry, Julian, Proclus, Symmachus, Iamblichus, and the rest who in discussing popular religion go beyond Plutarch, but again only develop in greater elaboration much the sort of attitude which Plutarch himself showed. What then may we conclude that the Platonists of Alexandria in Philo's day taught? Did they read Plato and Aristotle in antiquarian devotion, or had they already begun to stress the mystical aspects of Plato, and see the possibility of their symbolic representation in current mystery religions as Philo himself seems to most of his students to read Plato into his Jewish Scriptures, if not into his Jewish cultus, and as Plutarch certainly did a few years later with pagan myth and cult? 95</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE These are questions we cannot answer with certainty, since we have no documents from philosophers who might have been Philo's personal teachers. It has, however, been generally sup- posed that with Philo showing so much that was akin to later theories of emanation and of mystic identification and ascent, the mystic development of Platonism and Stoicism had already begun before Philo, and that it was this new type of philosophy, shot full to be sure with the phraseology of the older teachers, but essentially oriented not in critical but in mystic thinking, which Philo had from his environment, and was trying to find expressed in his Judaism. For Wolfson the problem does not exist. Since every docu- ment of importance which shows mystic philosophy comes from a writer like Plutarch who lived a half century after Philo, or from the chief Neo-Platonists and Gnostics who lived several centuries later, they are all irrelevant and can be completely ignored in discussing Philo's philosophical background. Neo- Platonism does not appear as an entry at all in Wolfson's elabo- rate Index. The Hermetica are mentioned in only a single passage (II, 114), along with the pseudo-Aristotelian De Mundo, Dio Chrysostom, Seneca, Maximus of Tyre, and Celsus. Geffcken and Norden had quoted these to show that there was a Greek tradition that God is nameless, and that when Philo talked of the namelessness of God he was drawing upon the tradition to which these writers attest. None of them is relevant to the dis- cussion, Wolfson asserts, because "with the exception of Seneca, who was a contemporary of Philo, all these sources are later than Philo." With these thus dismissed, Wolfson goes on to derive Philo's notion that God is not named from Jewish sources, a section which he summarizes: "In Scripture Philo has found (a) statements to the effect that God has not revealed His name to those to whom He appeared and also (b) laws pro- hibiting (1) to mention the proper name of God, (2) to take in vain any other name of God and (3) to treat lightly the word 'God' in general. Scripture thus teaches the doctrine of the unnamability of God" (II, 126). By this time Wolfson has quite lost sight of land. Nothing is clearer in the Torah and Talmud alike than that God has a name, "Yahweh," and that 96</page><page sequence="11">GOODENOUGH: WOLFSON'S PHILO it must not be pronounced because the name itself has so much power. The notion of the namelessness of God is essentially foreign to Judaism, and none of the proof-texts Wolfson dis- cusses to make the notion scriptural would ever have suggested such an idea to Philo or any one else de novo. But Wolfson will not allow it to be Greek. In spite of the fact that the idea is so essentially foreign to Judaism, and the plain meaning of many Greek writers, it is not Greek, for "No philosopher, as we have seen, ever said so explicitly" (II, 119). Wolfson lists (I, 93 f.) the Greek philosophers whom Philo quotes, the only ones, we see as we go on, who can legitimately be examined as possible sources for Philo's thinking. The mystical philosophers are by this method all excluded, since those whose names we know are all later than Philo, and they need not be mentioned. Philo was drawing only upon the earlier critical philosophers. One can defend such a method of study, perhaps, up to a point. Philo is to be explained only out of what fragments we have of his known predecessors, a method which works very well if only those statenlents in Philo are examined which can be shown to resemble statements found in those know predeces- sors (or else are Jewish in origin). If this limitation of Philo's sources to his known predecessors were followed out logically, and all of Philo taken into consideration, one would have to conclude that Philo was the inventor of Gnostic and Neo- Platonic thought-ways, since in embryo these ways are so much his own, and since such thought-ways come to us for the first time in Philo's writings. That conclusion would be an argument from silence which few would care to advance, but it could be advanced just the same. Wolfson does not reach that conclusion only because he resolutely omits every mystical element, phrase, or passage which he possibly can, and explains away, as in the case of the namelessness of God, what of it he feels forced to include. If this method were to be accepted to determine Philo's debt to the gentiles, it would have, however, to apply also to the Jewish sources, in which no document (or at least no rabbinical saying) could ever be quoted for "native Jewish tradition" which could not confidently be dated before Philo. For Philo's 97</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Jewish background presents much the same problem as the Greek. The rabbinic sayings and documents which we can date actually before Philo are extremely scattered and inadequate, and we can reconstruct his Jewish milieu from extra-Philonic sources with no greater confidence than his Greek. In the first place we shall never agree about the religious life of Palestine itself. What relation had the Sadducean to the Pharisaic points of view in Philo's day? How far at that time had rabbinic tradition developed toward the formation of the Mishna and the Midrash? How great influence did either Phari- sees or Saducees have in the religious life of the mass of Jews in Palestine, and if they had influence in what sort of paths would they have been leading? Where do the apocalyptic writings fit in, and how much interest in Messianism, and in what sort of Messianism, had the mass of Jews then? Still more problematic is the origin of Jewish life and worship as these appear in rab- binic tradition itself: where did Jews learn to use a blessed cup of wine in marriage, in the Seder, in circumcision, and at the beginning and ending of every Sabbath and festival, and what did it originally mean that it should still, like Greek usage, be so intimately connected with fire, light, life, and immortality? What did the mass of Jews even in Palestine really think of the religious observances of their gentile neighbors that they took in so many of the gentile customs? Of course we have such pro- tests as those of the books of Maccabees: but these books them- selves seem to tell of popular (and largely permanent) departures from the strict laws of the "pious ones" of that period quite as much as they tell of the political victories of the pious. I had almost said "of the pious minorities," but this matter of majority and minority also we do not know. Not one of these questions can be answered with any demon- stration or finality. That Wolfson or I have theories about all of this, that Graetz, Moore, Baron, Marx, Schiirer, Finkelstein, Bousset, and a host of others, have or had theories, only shows that for the religious situation in Palestine at the time of Philo we have nothing but theories, not answers with which we can, by adequate evidence, force all fair minds to agree. In the absence of an established norm or a total picture, the religious 98</page><page sequence="13">GOODENOUGH: WOLFSON'S PHILO point of view of the author of each document which survives from the period must be reconstructed out of that document itself, and its relation to any other document or tradition is the end, not the beginning, of our search. George Foote Moore's "normative Judaism," for example, was a reconstruction of a religious totality out of a few rabbinic fragments ascribed to the period before the destruction of the temple, along with a host of other fragments from a later period. It was a norm which he devised and applied for his own convenience, but never showed at all to be a generally recognized norm by all Jews of the period, though he projected his construct back into the Judaism of the first century, and thought it actually existed there. So he brushed apocalyptic Judaism out into the lunatic fringe, and regarded Philo as a person, like Melchizedek, without ancestors or descend- ants, a unique phenomenon, curious but quite unimportant for any picture of Judaism itself. It is not to be questioned that rabbinic Judaism, Moore's "normative" Judaism, had laid firm foundations by Philo's time, or that as it later developed this Judaism from the sixth century after Christ to the present was recognized generally as "orthodox" or "normative" (though many Cabbalists and Chassidim might question it). What we do not know is whether "normative Judaism" was normative even in Palestine for the mass of Jews before Philo's time. Still less to be reconstructed from non-Philonic writings is the Judaism of the Diaspora, specifically of Alexandria. We must grant without reservation Wolfson's contention that the Jews who came to Alexandria with their revered Torah brought also a tradition (or, as he does not suggest, various traditions) of its interpretation. In regarding Jerusalem as the center of their piety and in going there as often as possible for their festivals, Jews must have learned much from procedures in Jerusalem. But what all this added up to as a background for Philo and influence in his thinking we have only the writings of Philo himself to tell us. The scraps from pre-Philonic writers quoted by Eusebius, the scattered books like Aristeas and 2-4 Maccabees, are of great value, but present no coherent picture which we can take as a norm to apply to Philo, or to Alexandrian Judaism in general. 99</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Moore was sufficiently realistic to recognize that Philo did not fit into his "normative" picture. Wolfson would have us believe that Moore's "normative" Judaism, or as he calls it "native Jewish tradition" not only existed in Philo's day, but existed clearly in Philo's mind as the norm for his Judaism. Wolfson's method of demonstrating this is on scores of points to quote "native Jewish tradition" in parallel with statements of Philo. But here, in contrast with his rigid exclusion of all Greek sources not specifically earlier than Philo, Wolfson is amazingly uncritical. To be sure, in trying to show that Philo depended upon "native Jewish tradition" on any given point Wolfson does cite as a parallel the earliest appearance of the notion in a rabbinic source, but in few instances can he cite a parallel from a rabbi earlier than Philo, and most of his citations must be dated very much after him. Philo's interpretation of one passage of the Bible, says Wolfson (II, 226 f.), "is already found in native Jewish literature." The impression from Wolfson's way of writing is that "already" means that the idea is found in literature antecedent to Philo; but the "literature" Wolfson cites is the Mekilta of Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai, a tannaitic writing of the School of Akiba, whose author flourished nearly a century after Philo had died, fifty years later than Plutarch. This material Wolfson amplifies by quota- tions from Rashi of the eleventh century, the Sefer Mi,wot Gadol, completed in 1250, and the 'Ammude Golah, likewise of the thirteenth century.3 Now it is freely to be admitted that these writings, even the medieval ones, contain much early material, some of which must even antedate Philo; but the passage in the Mekilta to which Wolfson refers, according to Rabbi Sandmel who kindly looked it up for me, is referred to no rabbi by name at all, and so must be presumed to be a second century interpretation. Such a use of Jewish sources to recon- struct the Jewish background of Philo, use which takes from these later writings any convenient passage at random to assert 3 These dates and the following are taken from H. L. Strack, Introduction to the Talmud and Midrash (1931), or the Jewish Encyclopedia. 100</page><page sequence="15">GOODENOUGH: WOLFSON'S PHILO that it is material "already found in native Jewish literature," is indeed loose and misleading. The trouble is that this is not an isolated instance, a lapse such as every one makes, but the sort of demonstration of which his two volumes largely consist. In I, 247 Wolfson says: "By the time of Philo the term 'place' as an appellation of God was already in common Jewish usage in Palestinian Judaism." But his earliest evidence for this is a statement from Rabbi Jose ben Halafta of the late second century after Christ. I have no objection to the notion that this is a term which came to Philo from a very old Jewish tradition reaching back into Palestine itself, though there is no evidence to show it. Certainly Wolfson goes completely beyond his evidence when he says that by Philo's time the term was "in common Jewish usage in Palestine." At II, 222 f. Wolfson points out that Philo represents the command to honor one's parents as being "'on the border-line between the human and the divine' [quoting from Philo], for 'parents are to their children what God is to the world.' In native Jewish tradition the same view is expressed in the state- ment that 'Scripture places the honoring of father and mother on a level with the honoring of God.' " This last Wolfson quotes from the Mekilta of Ishmael4 with other parallels, at the earliest a century and a half after Philo was writing. The implication however is that in these we have documented the original of Philo's idea. To establish such a relationship not only does Wolfson by implication misrepresent the actual date of the "native" tradition, but by inadequately quoting Philo on the point he misrepresents Philo's own thinking, which was here purely Greek. For Philo says that parents are Oeol E/u4avEis, "manifest gods," who in begetting their children become creators parallel to God the creator.5 That is the reason they "are to their 4 Most conveniently consulted in the edition and translation by J. Z. Lauterbach (1933), II, 257 f., where this saying is referred to "Rabbi," who was born in 135 A. D. s See my The Jurisprudence of the Jewish Courts in Egypt, 67 ff. 101</page><page sequence="16">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE children what God is to the world." That parents might in any sense be called "gods" would have scandalized the rabbis, so Wolfson finds it convenient not to mention that Philo says so. But there is no reason to suppose any relation whatever between Philo's notion of parents and the late and quite different state- ments Wolfson quotes from the rabbis. Again, Philo discusses why Moses should have begun the Torah, a book of laws, with the story of Creation, and shows that this story is a proemium, as the Greeks called it, an introduction of a kind which has suggested to many of Philo's students the Pythagorean proimia to codes of laws, a few of which have survived.6 Ignoring this, Wolfson quotes (II, 209 f.) from the Tan.uma to show that in the passage Philo is following "native Jewish tradition." The Tanhuma is a collection of material begun in the fifth century after Christ, and finally completed much later, a typical mixture of a little quite early material (almost nothing from before the second century after Christ) with a great deal centuries later in origin. From this, without discussing the date of the particular material, Wolfson quotes from "a rabbi" that "the story of creation as well as the subsequent historical part [of the Torah] is for the purpose of 'making known the power of His might'." "Philo similarly says," Wolfson continues, that the story of creation demonstrates that "since God is the creator of the world and the founder of the laws of nature, the Law for human guidance which was subsequently revealed by him is in harmony with these laws of nature." Wolfson goes on to report Philo as thinking that Moses designed the historical part of the Torah to demonstrate the existence and providence of God. In this rabbinic "parallel" not only is the "rabbi's" date so uncertain as to make his evidence quite dubious for Philo's background, but the ideas expressed by Philo and the "rabbi" are quite different. Any apparent similarity evaporates when 6 See f. Brehier, Les idees philosophiques et religieus de Philon d'Alexandrie (1908 or 1925), p. 24. Colson thinks the allusion is to Plato's Laws and Re- public, perhaps also to Zeno; see his translation VI, 472, n. 102</page><page sequence="17">GOODENOUGH: WOLFSON'S PHILO we see what Philo actually said in the passage. Philo says that he who would "use the laws [of Moses] must be a happy follower of nature and live according to the ordering of the universe" (ro0 oXov) ;7 "harmony with the universe" (roV 7ravrbs), Philo shortly says,8 is "agreement with the Logos of Nature." In reporting these statements Wolfson has reversed the singular and plural. While Philo talks of the Jewish laws (plural) as in harmony with Nature (singular), and says that agreement with the order (singular) of the universe is agreement with the Logos (singular) of Nature, Wolfson makes obedience to the Jewish Law (singular) a conformity to the laws (plural) of nature. The shift is extremely subtle, but quite basic. For to the rabbis the Torah existed eternally as a collection of individual laws, while to Philo, like the Greeks, the Law which was eter- nally existent was the essentially singular Logos of Nature or of God and had plural manifestation only as it represented itself in the material of nouns and verbs, just as the Idea of Beauty became plural for Plato only in its material manifestations. So as Plato desired to rise from beauties to Beauty, Philo saw the laws of the Torah as chiefly important for leading him beyond them to the Law of God and Nature. This contrast and ambition distinguishes Philo from the rabbis who almost universally (I know no exceptions, but, not being a rabbinist, have not in mind every possible passage) saw the heavenly Torah itself as a collection of Laws, in which each "jot" and "tittle", that is not only every word but every letter and every ornamental stroke on every letter, was eternally existent and sacred.9 Wolfson has changed Philo's statement to make him too speak of the eternal laws, and so to make him conform to rabbinic thinking. A similar difficulty arises (II, 201) when Wolfson discusses Philo's notion that the ten commandments underlie all the specific laws as their basic principles, the primary and most miraculous formulations of the Law behind all the laws. As a parallel Wolfson refers to the Canticles Rabbah, which, like all 7 Mos. ii, 48. 8 Mos. ii, 52. 9 G. F. Moore, Judaism (1927-1930), I, 269 f.; III, 83. 103</page><page sequence="18">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE these midrashim, has early material, but which was completed almost certainly not earlier than the sixth century. Since Wolfson does not demonstrate that his particular quotation here is from an early date, we must assume that it is, if not the latest thing in the work, at least centuries later than Philo. Yet, simply with reference to the Canticles Rabbah Wolfson says: "In rabbinic literature, it is similarly said that the ten commandmants contain all the laws of the Torah. This last method of classification is adopted by Philo." A few lines below he speaks of the "tradi- tional origin" of Philo's method of classifying the "special laws" under one or another of the ten commandments. The reader unaware of the dates of the rabbinic material would naturally suppose that Wolfson has indicated the source of Philo's ideas. The reader who is aware of the dates wonders what Wolfson can be thinking about to write in this way. Wolfson is sure that Philo's allegorical interpretation had its inspiration in "native Jewish tradition." He begins (I, 115-131) by saying that, like the rabbis, however much Philo might read into Scripture he never gave up a sense of the value of its literal meaning: with which every student of Philo would at once agree. It is true, Wolfson goes on (I, 131-133), that Greeks had alle- gorized their Homer, Hesiod, and other sources of mythology, though with this Philo could have had no sympathy because he so completely rejected Greek mythology. "But what he denies to mythology he claims for the divinely revealed Hebrew Scrip- ture" (I, 133). Up to this point Wolfson seems to be going along with the rest of us in seeing Philo's allegory heavily indebted to the Greeks. Then he begins to point out that the rabbis too hedged at the anthropomorphic expressions about God in the Scriptures, that they tempered the naivete of many statements in the historical narratives of the Torah, and frequently in truth abrogated the letter of specific laws by their interpreta- tions to adapt them to later society. "This is the conception of Scripture with which Philo started," Wolfson says (I, 138), where we would still agree, even though some of the parallels in interpreting specific laws which Wolfson quotes between Philo and the rabbis do not seem to establish that Philo had his 104</page><page sequence="19">GOODENOUGH: WOLFSON'S PHILO interpretation of the laws from rabbis of the "native" school. Let us admit that Philo did not have to learn from the Greeks that there were many awkward passages in the Torah which had to be explained away. The real problem is where he learned that he had not the true meaning of Scripture until he had a mean- ing in harmony with Greek categories of thought and mysticism. This central problem Wolfson barely skirts. This allegorizing of myths was in Greek tradition especially the work of the hellenistic and later centuries. Another product of the same period, one which has been completely documented as pagan from many sources and many scholars, is the notion of the radiance of God's nature which manifested itself as the Logos when considered as a unit, but as Powers when considered for the plural impact of the radiation. In more popular religious circles these Powers became descending pairs of mythical per- sonalities. Rejecting of course the mythical personalities, it has generally been supposed that Philo shows this pagan doc- trine in Jewish dress in his passages on the Logos and the Powers. Wolfson disagrees for several reasons, the chief being that to him both the Logos and the Powers are Jewish created beings rather than pagan emanations. In arguing that Philo's Logos was created (I, 234 ff.) he admits that Philo never said so, but makes that inference none the less from several of Philo's state- ments. "The Logos is thus spoken of as the eldest and most generic of created things," he begins, quite overtranslating Philo's Wrpea/3vTaros Katl 'yevtKKraros Trwv 6o a y&amp;yovE,IO which means "eldest and most generic of the things which came into existence," without reference one way or the other to their being created. Other phrases which imply to Wolfson that the Logos was created are: "'older than all things which are the object of creation,' as not being uncreated as God, though not created as human beings, as being the first-born son of God, the man of God, the image of God, second to God, a second God, and as being called a god by those who have an imperfect knowl- edge of the real God" (I, 234). Wolfson continues to refer to " LA, iii, 175. 105</page><page sequence="20">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE more passages of the sort, not one of which proves his point. He admits an eternal Logos, but only as the mind of God, as which it is "something identical with the essence of God" (I, 231). But in its usual sense of a manifestation in some way to be dis- tinguished from God it is "something created by God" (I, 239). So when Philo talks of the Logos and Powers as "growing out" or coming from a "source," Wolfson feels that he can say finally, we must not think of emanations (I, 237). Wolfson has an excellent passage (I, 261 ff.) discussing Philo's relation to Aristotle on the ground that Philo makes the Logos the 6pyavov of God in creation. In contrast Sophia is not the 6pyavov but the "mother and nurse" (I, 266 ff.), Wolfson says, for these are terms which in other passages Philo applies to matter as contrasted with form. Philo could not have had this, Wolfson assures us, from the Egyptian and the Greek mystic notion of Mother Earth, the mother and nurse of us all, which such men as Plutarch explained as being the material, or the universal feminine, principle. Wolfson does not discuss this evidence, for Philo "undoubtedly" (I, 269) got it by reading the Hebrew 1]D now as artisan (1])), now as nurse (1P)), and now as their mother (1D$) (I, 267 f.). This is pilpul with distinc- tion! To the sexual imagery with which Philo discusses the relation of God and Sophia Wolfson alludes only in a footnote of two lines (I, 266). One could go on with this sort of thing indefinitely. In reading the book I early came to keep a red pencil at hand and mark those places where Wolfson ties Philo back to "native Jewish tradition." Both volumes are studded with red. But Wolfson's parallels in almost no case have any justification to pose as the "source" of Philo. That Philo must have had much in common with rabbinic tradition no one in his senses would deny, or that the solution of what that relationship was is one of the most important problems of Philonic study. Throughout my own writing I have often lamented my lack of rabbinic training, and so my incompetence to deal with the question. I have accordingly never tried to write a comprehensive work on Philo because I have felt that without a solution to the rabbinic variable the 106</page><page sequence="21">GOODENOUGH: WOLFSON S PHILO formula of Philo's thinking could not be solved. In trying to prove too much, and in his uncritical use of rabbinic sources, Wolfson has only confused the matter more deeply. So far as this matter is concerned his thesis seems to be his statement (I, 56): "Alexandrian Judaism at the time of Philo [it was Philo who brought it to full development, he says (I, 95)] was a col- lateral branch of Pharisaic Judaism, which flourished in Pales- tine at that time, both of them having sprung from that pre- Maccabean Judaism which had been molded by the activities of the Scribes." The basic confusion of Wolfson's thought is well expressed here. Wolfson says not that Alexandrian and Pharisaic Judaism were collateral branches descended from a single Jewish original, to which no one could object; but that Alexandrian Judaism was a branch of Pharisaic Judaism because both had a common ancestor. This is to say that my cousin is my father because we have a common grandfather. The statement would be only a meaningless and amusing solecism such as we all make frequently if its confusion did not represent the confusion of the book as a whole. For the impression Wolfson makes abundantly is that he believes that in the writings of rabbinic Judaism, even quite late Judaism, we can find the source of Philo's thinking: not the direct source, for Philo had never read the Mekilta, but still the ideas with which Philo was working. Whenever there is a similarity it could never be a coincidence, or the influence of hellenized thinking on the rabbis, but only something which Philo had from the rabbis themselves. This is true however remote the similarity. To such a thesis we must imply say "non probatur." A final word on methodology. Wolfson protests (I, 106 f.) that it is not enough in studying a thinker of the past to collect related passages from his writings and arrange them under headings, with comparsion to similar passages in other philos- ophers and the Bible, but that we must try to reconstruct the latent processes of the man's reasoning and to determine the true meaning of what is said by seeing how he came to say it. But if we may add the rabbinic writings to the philosophers and the Bible, this rejected method is exactly that of Wolfson. He takes 107</page><page sequence="22">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE related passages of Philo from all his works (without reference to their contexts there, or the character of the different writings), finds parallels in a rabbinic source or in Plato, Aristotle, or the Stoics, and shows how the statements of Philo might have been made if he had had the passages from the other sources "clearly in mind" as he wrote. As to whether Philo did have those sources "clearly in mind" Wolfson never seems to doubt, if by them he can explain a passage. By such a method we can make individual passages mean about what we please: actually the only control, beside such mechanical matters as caution about the dates of material one treats as a source, is integration. How do our conclusions about details fit into the man's work as a whole? Oddly Wolfson's statement on methodology does not mention integration. The total picture of the man, let's call him Philo again, can only be either a pattern we impose upon him or the pattern of Philo himself. Actually we all come out with a com- promise, one where our subjective notions have come at best only more or less to reflect those of Philo himself. That is what I meant when I said in another connection that the study of Philo, or any other philosopher, will always be a spiral approach- ing Philo as a limit. But what I insist is that much as we must always try to understand fragmentary statements of Philo by reference to "parallels" or "sources" of one sort or another, in constructing the totality we must follow large consecutive blocks of Philo's thinking and actual presentation, rather than blocks and headings of our own construction. In the series of writings commonly called the "Exposition of the Law" Philo develops a great thesis which begins with the foundation of Law (not laws) in the creation of the universe, and goes on to the incarnate representation of this Law in the Patriarchs, each of whom is a vboios jt4/vXos; then to the miraculous formulation of Law verbally as laws, first in the decalogue and then secondarily, using these as principles, in the individual laws of the Torah. Philo has throughout concentrated upon the fact that these verbal laws, as general principles or as derivative laws, complied with the basic Moral Principle of the universe which metaphysi- 108</page><page sequence="23">GOODENOUGH: WOLFSON'S PHILO cally he expressed in the terms Logos or Sophia as he had learned them from the Greeks. So at the end of the "Exposition" Philo returns to review this, to discuss the fact that the true Jew (true nobility) is one who, gentile or Jew by birth, understands and observes the Jewish Law with this sense of its implications in mind. Philo closes the work by discussing the rewards and punishments of this legal system. It is curious that to this great work of Philo, made up of many treatises, Wolfson never once alludes as a whole, and this inte- gration of Philo's thought, which is as near Philo's integration as I think we can ever get, Wolfson never discusses. The problem of Philo's relation to rabbinic Judaism and Greek philosophy is not to be solved by splitting his atoms, but by understanding his integration, and the same may be said of understanding Philo himself. It gradually appears that Wolfson cares very little for Philo himself, only for Philo as the confluence of Judaism and Greek critical philosophy, and so as the keystone in his construc- tion of the history of European philosophy. Wolfson has written a great tour de force in taking so many fragments of Philo and making them fit into a preconceived notion of Philo and his place in history. No one hereafter may write on a passage in Philo without first seeing whether Wolfson has discussed it and what he has to say about it, especially for the relation of the passage to classical philosophy. The book should be called A Philonic System, for this it is. The mistake is to call it simply Philo, for I found little of Philo himself or his spirit in it. 109</page></plain_text>
