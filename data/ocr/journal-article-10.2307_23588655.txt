<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUMMARIES THE CENSER INCENSE AND Τ AMID INCENSE by Menahem Haran {pp. 115—125) In the present essay, the writer seeks to explain the various methods of using spices and incense for ritual purposes, as these methods are conceived in the Biblical sources. The writer does, not here enter into the explanation of the historic place of incense ceremonies in Yahweh-worship, i. e. whether such ceremonies were introduced into that worship only from the 7th Century B.C.E. and onward (as Wellhausen and many others supposed), or whether they date from an earlier period. However, he does incidentally summarize the debate on this issue, a debate which is in part founded upon certain archaeological discoveries (e. g., the thymiateria, the incense altars from the Iron Age, and the hammanim). At the same time, an exact under standing of the Biblical evidence must be achieved before the historical problem can be presented and before archaeological evidence can be adduced. There are three distinct ways of using incense and spices for ritual purposes mentioned in the Bible: (A) When the incense is used in addition to some sacrifical offering. The reference here is principally to the "memorial part" (azkarah) of the meal-offering, which included frankincense (cf. especially Lev. 11:1,15, VI:8). (B) When the spices are used as a sacrificial offering in themselves. In this case they are in the form of finely-ground powders, which constitute the incense. Sacrificial offerings of this kind are well-known in the Priestly sources, where they are considered as legitimate. They are mentioned in Ezek. VII:10—11, XVI:18, XXIII:41 and especially in P, Lev. X:l—3, Nu. VII, XVI: 16—XVII:5, XVII:11—13. It is possible that Deut. XXXIII: 10 and I Sam. 11:28 refer to this kind of separate sweet-smelling sacrifice. This sacrificial offering need not necessarily be made on the altar, but may simply be burned in a censer (mahtah). Nevertheless, it may not be burned anywhere at all, but in general is offered up within the confines of the Temple-court. According to Ρ it is the exclusive right of the priests to make this offering. The sources have not explicitly stated the composition of this sacrifice, nor what kinds of spices were included in it. This type of incense appears to have been used in ritual practices in Egypt, and from there spread out to the ancient towns of Canaan (the Egyptian ritual did not recognize incense altars). (C) When the incense is offered up on the altar of gold within the Tabernacle (Ex. XXX:1—10). Wellhausen and many other critics came to the conclusion that the altar of gold and the incense associated with it belonged to a later stratum of P, as the first stratum of Ρ recognised only the censer-incense. The author emphasizes, however, that there is no duality necessarily involved here, but that Ρ itself contains teferences to two kinds of incense-offering. The incense offered up on the altar of gold is, according to the conception of P, a specific kind of incense, for use only within the Tabernacle, whereas the regular kind of incense is offered up in censers in the court. The special nature of the internal incense is shown, first of all, by its constitution, which Ρ specifically details (Ex. XXX:34—38); the very fact that details are given in itself points to the unusual nature of this type of incense. Since the dominant</page><page sequence="2">II SUMMARIES base of this incense consisted of the "sweet spices" (sammim) — something which in itself was quite unusual, apparently, for "sweet spices" contrast in flavour with in cense — it was called "an incense of sweet spices" (qetoret sammim). The other kind of incense is called simply qetoret, without additional qualifying terms. This unusual material composition served, according to the system characteristic of P, as an external sign of recognition of the ritualistic individuality of the internal incense. The author, in conclusion, summarizes the differences between the two main kinds of incense as follows: (1) The regular incense was burned in the court and on censers, whereas the incense of sweet spices was burned within the tabernacle, and on a special altar. (2) All of the priests were free to offer up the censer-incense, but only the High Priest, according to Ρ (this is not in keeping with the Talmudic understanding of the matter) could offer up the incense of sweet spices (as was the case with all the other rituals associated with the Sanctuary. (3) The censer-incense is offered up spontaneously, and is perhaps not even prescribed as a legal obligation; the incense of sweet spices, however, is an obligatory, well-ordered ritual. Essentially, it is a "permanent" (tamid) incense, i. e., an incense which must be offered up twice daily, at the hours appointed for all the tamid rituals (in the morning and at dusk). For this reason, it is in one place called by the special term "a perpetual incense" (qetoret tamid, Ex. XXX:8). The censer-incense is an "independent" offer ing in the full sense of the word: it is not associated with any ritual act whatsoever. But according to the conception of P, the "perpetual incense" is an inseparable part of a general complex of ritual acts done within the sanctuary. The perpetual incense is connected with all the other internal ritual acts of the tamid service (lighting the lamps, the show-bread, etc.) and cannot be described — according to the concep tion of Ρ — without being associated with these other elements. The author intends to discuss a number of the problems touched on above in future studies. PIOUS MEN, MEN OF DEEDS, AND THE EARLY PROPHETS by G. Β. Sarfatti (pp. 126—153) In the present essay the author analyzes a number of Biblical stories concerning the early prophets (especially Elijah and Elisha) and also a number of Talmudic stories about "pious men" and "men of deeds" (especially Honi Hamme'agel and R. Haninah b. Dosa); he compares these stories with one another and points out the common elements in them. Such common features we find, for example, in the outlooks of Honi and Elijah during times of drought: they both utter oaths ("As the Lord the God of Israel liveth...", I Kings XVII: 1; "I swear by thy name...", Ta'anit 111:8); they both give advance notice, in the form of advice, of God's response ("Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain"; I Kings XVIII:41; "Go out and bring in the Passover ovens that they be not softened", Ta'anit ibid.). Essentially, the miraculous event is carried out in three stages, in the case of both of these figures: firstly, there is an act indicating under standing of the event about to transpire (Elijah's building of the altar, Honi's baking the cake); secondly, there are prayers on behalf of Israel and of the pro tagonists themselves ("...Let it be known this day that Thou art God in Israel, and that I am Thy servant" in the words of Elijah, I Kings XVIII:36; "...Thy children have turned their faces to me, for that I am like a son of the house before thee...</page><page sequence="3">SUMMARIES III have pity on thy children" in the words of Honi, Ta'anit ibid.)\ and thirdly, there is God's answer ("Then the fire of the Lord "fell", I Kings XVIII:38; "Rain began falling drop by drop", Ta'anit, ibid..). The miraculous performances of Hanina b. Dosa in curing children of their illnesses are reminiscent of the similar *deeds of Elijah and Elisha, although he is not able to revive the dead as are they; especially worthy of remark is the similarity between the story of the sending of Jeroboam's wife to Ahijah the Shilonite concerning Jeroboam's son (I Kings XIV:1—18) and the sending of the two scholars to R. Hanina b. Dosa in connection with the son of Raban Gamaliel (Berakot 34b; Jer. Berakot V. 5). The two incidents are similar to each other in practically all respects, but especially in two details: the recipient in each case knows the contents of the message even before the messenger speaks, and he sets the hour in which a change will occur for better or for worse in the sickness of the child in question. Similar to the bodily position of Elijah during prayer ("...and he put his face between his knees", I Kings XVIII:42) is the position assumed by R. Hanina during his prayer ("He placed his head between his knees", Berakot 34b). In the same way it is possible to compare the deeds of the early prophets with the deeds of later personalities, such as Aba Hilkiah, R. Aha, R. Pinehas b. Yair, and R. Simeon b. Halafta. These personalities all belong to the category which the Talmud terms "pious men" (חסידים) and "men of deeds" (אנשי מעשה) who are distinguished by the fact that their works exceed their wisdom, as in the saying of R. Hanina b. Dosa himself (Abot III. 10); the principal power of such individuals rests not in halakic disputation, the relating of aggadic lore, or the composing of ethical maxims (as was the case with many of their contemporaries in M'ishnaic and Talmudic times) but rather in the purity of their deeds, which were intended to please their Creator and to bring benefits to their fellow men. The present author concludes from evidence such as has been stated above that these "men of deeds" represented a later development of the early prophetic type. These men were similar to the prophets in their actions in daily life, in their conversations, and in their prayers and customs. Both types lived simple lives — though perhaps not always in real poverty — without having any official position in the ruling organization and in the religious ritual. Their influence consisted mainly in their deeds and the example they set for others, rather than in their homiletic and pedagogical abilities. The author relies in the present discussion on Prof. Y. Kaufmann's description of the prophetic type, who had two characteristic sides: that of the popular seer, who was endowed with mysterious powers in order to see hidden and future things, who had the power to heal the sick and to bring about miracles, and to whom the people could turn in time of need or trouble; and the messenger who could clearly hear the words of God, who approached the people and their leaders in the name of God, and served as their comforter and bearer of good and evil tidings. The piety of these Talmudic figures reminds one of the prophet's role as popular guardian; but the responsibility of the prophet as messenger of God does not reveal itself in the stories about the men of deeds: they do not have the same lofty position as the one who hears the words of God himself and who delivers those words to the people. The miracles which the men of deeds perform are introduced to prove to the people the omnipotence of God, his unity, and his superiority over all the petty battles of the world; these activities of theirs closely resemble those of the early prophets.</page><page sequence="4">IV SUMMARIES In an additional note the author considers the character of Honi Hamme'agel as it is described in the words of the Amoraim; their statements about Honi differ considerably from those found in the Mishnah. The Tannaitic statements contain historical reminiscences, whereas those of the Amoraim represent a Hebrew version of foreign legends. The story of Honi's seventy years of sleep, which is related in both Talmuds with a few variations (Ta'anit 23a; Jer. Ta'anit 111:9) has two parallels: one is the story of Diogenes Laertius concerning Epimenides, and the other is the tale of the king's negro slave related in IV Baruch. The author analyzes and compares these legendary tales, which were certainly variations of the same story. "TAKING OR ACCEPTING THE RIGHT HAND" IN TALMUDIC PHRASAEOLOGY by Isidore Wartsky (pp. 154—164) The author here deals with two obscure Tannaitic phraes: (1) טלו לכם ימים in the Tannaitic Midrash Sifre on Numbers, par. 131; and (2) לקבל ימין in a Genizah fragment of Mekiltah (also a Tannaitic Midrash) on a part of Deuteronomy, which was published by Solomon Schechter in Tifereth Israel V (p. 189). The first phrase seemingly means "take you days", but this meaning does not fit the context. Fortunately we have a parallel passage in Pesiqta de Rab Kahana (ed. Buber, pp. 319—320), where an Amora uses most of the peculiar expressions found in the Sifre-passage; and there, according to the Oxford MS, the reading is טלו לכם ימין. Now this form of the phrase may bear the meaning "take you the right hand", and since repentance is the theme of the context it is reasonable to assume that "taking or accepting the right hand" signifies repentance and reconciliation. The author then establishes the correctness of the reading in the Oxford MS, as against un reliable variants in other MSS, and proves that the initially-assumed sense of the phrase occurs in another Tannaitic text, where it has the certain meaning of repent ance; the phrase in question is לקבל ימין. A detailed examination of the subject matter brings out the fact that the complete sentence כל הרוצה לקבל ימין יבוא ויקבל ("whosoever wishes to accept the right hand, let him come and accept it") cor responds to the words employed in the same connection in the Tosefta, Sotah (ed. Zuckermandel, p. 311): :אם אתם חוזרים בכם אני מקבל אתכם ("if you repent, we shall receive you favourably"). Thus it becomes evident that לקבל ימין means "to accept the right hand (that is held out to the repentant)", i. e. to repent and be received favourably. Likewise, the phrase טלו לכם ימין ("take you, or accept you, the right hand") really means: "repent and be received favourably". In this sense the phrase suits the context perfectly. It is pointed out that the two identical phrases in question are doubtlessly related to the well-known anthropomorphic phrase ימינו פשוטה ל־ ("God's right hand is stretched out to —"), which is used in Sifre and elsewhere in the sense of readiness to receive repentant sinners favourably. Finally, the author discusses again the reading in Sife טלו לכם ימים, and arrives at the conclusion that in the light of טלו לכם ימין the final mem of ימים must be regarded as a dialectical mutation of final nun. Cases of such mutation are given by J.N. Epstein in his Introduction to the Version of the Mishnah, p. 1232.</page><page sequence="5">SUMMARIES AN "ALEXANDER GESTE" IN A PARMA MS by David Flusser (pp, 165—184) The present essay includes a detailed description of a Hebrew composition entitled Ma'as eh Aleksandros (An "Alexander Geste"), which can be found in the De Rossi collection in Parma. The composition is made up of three separate Greek stories: (1) The Alexander Romance (Pseudocallisthenes); (2) a Greek chronicle on the history of the world from Alexander to Augustus; (3) the conclusion of Palladius' work on the Brahmans. The present Hebrew translation of the first two works was already known as an interpolation in a number of versions of the Hebrew Yossipon, but an examination of the Parma MS shows that the interpolator changed much of the text. The first two compositions were translated from Greek, and it appears that the third composition as well was taken directly from the Greek original. A) The section from the "Alexander Romance" was translated from the earliest version of the original. In places where the translator did not abridge his text, the translation is literal, and therefore can serve as an important aid in reconstructing the text of the Romance. B) The By2antine chronicle describing the history of the world from Alexander to Augustus is based upon the Cronicon of Eusebius, but its author has added interest ing historical details. Two such details are known from no other source. The first is that Pompeius "took prisoner Aristobulus alone, for his having rebelled against the Romans, because he relied upon Mithridates after the death of his father" (r. "mother"?). The second detail is that "at the 192nd Olympiad, Tiberius, the Roman general, built the cities Tauromenion and Tyndaris". This bit of information proves that a colonia Augusta was founded in the two above-mentioned cities of Sicily in the years 21—9 B.C.E. by Tiberius. C) Only the end of Palladius' composition on the Brahmans has been preserved; as the copyist of the Parma MS has pointed out, a number of pages were missing from the manuscript which he used. The composition itself is preserved verbatim as an interpolation in MS A of the "Alexander Romance" (III.7—16). In the first two editions of Palladius' work, only the first part (III.7—10) is ascribed to Palladius, and from the section preserved in the Hebrew translation in MS Parma it appears that it included only this part. Thus it may be surmised that only this part is the original work of Palladius. THE THIRTEEN PRINCIPLES OF MAIMONIDES AS TRANSLATED BY ALHARIZI by Μ. Η. Goshen-Gottstein (pp. 185—196) Although an anonymous fragment from a Hebrew translation of Maimonides' introduction to Pereq Heleq, published by Schorr in 1887, has long been recognised as Alharizi's work, the famous Thirteen Principles of Faith, which are part of that introduction, have been printed only in the rendering of Shelomo ibn Ya'qub, one of the minor medieval translators. Alharizi's translation is the more important for us, because it adds to our knowledge of the language of the great medieval translators and enables us to compare the ways and means of various translators in dealing with the same Arabic source. However, since the alleged translation of the Principles</page><page sequence="6">VI SUMMARIES by Samuel Ibn Tibbon does not exist, Alharizi turns out to be the only great translator who rendered the Principles into Hebrew. Our study shows, that even when not preparing an edition with detailed apparatus, we cannot afford to rely on one or two manuscripts. There is evidence in various manuscripts of alternative readings, which are probably due to the con tinuous re-shaping of the translation as well as to inner syntactic changes and "Hebraising" simplifications, which took place after the original translation was completed. These, as well as the "double-translation" device, are, of course, phenomena not unknown to the student of what may be termed the "Philology of translations". Of special interest are those cases in which we can compare not only the different methods of expression of the translators of the Principles, but also the original Hebrew expressions as used by Maimonides himself in his great legal compendium, the Mishneh Torah. This article, whilst discussing these problems prior to the publication of the text itself, is intended to continue the present author's series of studies on the language of medieval Hebrew translators. THE TRANSLATION OF JEWISH PRAYERS INTO ARABIC (Remarks on the Article of Y. Ratzhabi in Tarbiz, XXV, p. 101) by Joseph Kafih (pp. 197—208) In Yehudah Ratzahbi's note on the translation of Hebrew prayers into Arabic (Tarbiz XXV, p. 101) a few details have not been stated correctly, and it is the purpose of the present note to put them in order. 1) Mr. Ratzahbi writes that the Arabic language did not penetrate into the syna gogal worship in Yemen, and that there were no Arabic translations of any of the prayers. The present writer points out that Yemenite prayer-books contain the Eighteen Benedictions in Arabic; several such texts are here reproduced, and ac companied by a Hebrew translation. The writer, furthermore, possesses some manuscripts which contain Arabic prayers. 2) It is here demonstrated that Saadia Gaon's translation of the Torah was indeed in use in the synagogues of Yemen, contrary to Mr. Ratzahbi's statement. 3) The reason for the preference in Yemen of the Aramaic translation of Onkelos over the Arabic translation of Saadia rests in the Geonic decision recorded by R. Amram Gaon in his prayer-book, and is not the result of the reverence accorded to the translation of Onkelos or of the profane nature of the Arabic language. 4) The reason that Aramaic was held in reverence by the people is to be found in the homiletic statements recorded in Sifre to Deuteronomy, to the effect that the Bible was also given in Aramaic — and is not due to the fact that there are Aramaic passages in the Bible. 5) The prayer "Hannoten teshu'ah" (for the safety of the kingdom) is not included in Yemenite prayer-books because this prayer is a curse uttered against the violent rules of all ages who caused suffering among the Jews, while the rulers would turn to the Jews and ask for their blessings. This prayer could not be translated, as it would then lose its meaning. Furthermore, this prayer was not needed in Yemen, and as a consequence there was no need to translate it.</page><page sequence="7">SUMMARIES VII PARSHIYYOT AND HAFTAROT by S. Esh (pp. 209—212) On the basis of several passages from the Rabbinic literature, and of manuscript readings, the author discusses the problem of the pericope Ntsabim (which formed a single pericope together with W ay yelekh), of the existence of a pericope beginning with Ex. XXXIX:32, and of Pentateuchal sections which lack accompanying Pro phetic portions. NOTES ON J. BLAU'S ESSAY "HATAN DAMIM" (Tarbiz XXVI, pp. 1—3) by S. Ben-Shabbat (p. 213) The author here offers new explanations for the terms והגעתם (Ex. IV:25) and hatan, which were dealt with in Blau's essay. CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SOLUTION OF CERTAIN RIDDLES BY YEHUDAH HALLEVI AND SHELOMOH IBN GABIROL by Y. Ratzahbi (p. 214) The present writer discusses the article of Mr. S. Ben-Shabat (Tarbiz XXV, pp. 385—392) and arrives at some new conclusions about the riddles in question. BOOK REVIEW Urbach, Ε. Ε.: בעלי התוססות (The Tosafists). Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1955. Reviewed by I. Twersky (pp. 215—227) A synthesis of the historical researches carried out on the Franco-German Tosafists has long been a major desideratum of Jewish scholarship. For the past hundred years or more, a host of scholars, working with such variegated source-material as Tosafot, codes, responsa, novellae, homilies, polemics, liturgical hymns, exegetical works, and commentaries, have attempted to ferret out detailed biographical and literary data concerning the major historical personalities, and to reconstruct the general contours of this intellectually significant period of Jewish history. However, many glaring gaps have remained. Sreinschneider was remarkably lacking in interest in this field, and Zunz's alphabetical enumeration of Tosafists in his Zur Geschichte und Literatur is exceedingly dry. Prof. Urbach's comprehensive study of the Tosafists, although not as yet definitive, is indeed a most praiseworthy step in the right direction. This study not only provides the long-awaited synthesis, but includes many original insights and suggestions. All of the standard literary problems relevant to this period and to this literary genre — such, for example, as the pseudepigraphic parts of Rashi's commentary or the composition and structure of R. Tarn's Sefer Hayyashar — are discussed in detail. The problems are analysed, various theories concerning them are critically examined, and final or tentative solutions are proposed. The same is true for the many biographical problems. Questions of identification — for example, of R. Shemayah (celebrated disciple of Rashi), R. Joseph of Orleans (known as Bekor Shor), R. Joseph Porat, and the Bohemian disciples of R. Tam — are discussed and resolved with great perception. The result is a valuable reference book,</page><page sequence="8">VIII SUMMARIES distinguished by its breadth of content, richness of detail, vividness of presentation and independence of mind. However, the value of the book as a reference work is impaired somewhat (only technically, to be sure) by the lack of a systematic, an notated bibliography, which would bring together the impressive bibliographical information scattered through the book. A study of such scope is evidently predicated upon certain methodological prin ciples or directive suppositions. A constant factor in Prof. Urbach's analytic method is to compare phenomena of Jewish intellectual history with parallel aspects of general history. With commendable restraint he does not seek to ascertain the influence of one on the other (almost always the Christian on the Jewish), but merely to indicate certain parallels. However, this line of demarcation is quite tenuous and is in fact straddled by the author, who is at times attracted to the neutral and amorphous idea of parallelism and at times to the relatively positive concept of influence. It should be stressed that the reviewer does not wish to question the validity or deny the fruitfulness of this comparative approach per se, but only to assert that it must be used prudently and cautiously. In the case of the pertinent matters discussed in the present volume, moreover, not only is the possibility of actual influence remote, but even the objective similarities are sometimes more apparent than real. Prof. Urbach asserts, for instance, that the Tosajot are com parable to the Glossae written during the 12th and 13th Centuries on the margins of the Justinian Code. This comparison is subsequently modified by the author, who must acknowledge the rudimentary, far-reaching difference between the Codex, which is a law book par excellence, and the Talmud, which is very far from a corpus juris. In view of this fact, Prof. Urbach circumscribes the comparison, restricting it to the glossae on the Vulgate rather than on the Roman and canonical law books. By this time, the entire comparison appears rather weak. The distinctive characteristic of the work of the medieval glossators starting with Guarnerius is none other than the legal glosses — and in this the resemblance is minimal; Scriptural glosses were secondary in importance, and should be compared, if a comparison is to be undertaken, to Jewish Bible exegesis rather than to Talmudic commentary. Furthermore, Scriptural glosses are not peculiar to the 12th Century, the period of the first Tosafot with which Prof. Urbach seeks to correlate the Glossae as uniform aspects or expressions of a cultural Zeitgeist. Already in the ninth century we find Walafrid Strabo, Carolingian scholar, poet, and Hebraist, composing the Glosae Or dinaria on the Vulgate. Finally, it should be mentioned that of all the types of glosses — namely, the summulae, continuationes, and distinctiones — that type which has most affinity with Jewish writings is the Quaestio disputata, which is not mentioned in the work under consideration. A number of other comparisons suggested by the author, which fluctuate between assertions of influence and indications of parallelism, are analyzed in this review: the honorable position held by women in the family of Rashi and the chivalrous attitudes of the amour courtois; Rabbenu Tarn and Peter Abelard, French dialectician and theologian; the problem of dowry and the dos profecticia; the tendency of later German Tosafists to code-writing and the contemporary Rechtsbiicher; and the habit of anonymity.</page></plain_text>
