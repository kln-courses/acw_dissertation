<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Monkey to Man: The Evolution of a Geometric Sculptural Type SUSAN LANGDON Abstract Among the bronze votive offerings known from Greek sanctuaries of the eighth century occurs a type of figurine represented as sitting or squatting with elbows on knees and hands to mouth. Despite the formal consistency of a dozen such figures, their identity and meaning have re- mained unclear. The present study examines the known figurines together with a popular class of related pendants from northern Greece. This evidence demonstrates the adaptation of an image derived from Near Eastern and Egyptian sources to the needs of early Greek sanctuaries and graves, and offers a glimpse into the formation of the early Greek symbolic system. A Spartan origin for the type is proposed. The transference of the motif from indepen- dent figurine to pendant decoration at the end of the period marks a unique passage of mainstream Geometric sanctuary art into the realm of popular art.* The human figure sitting with its hands raised to its face is one of the most vivid yet mystifying images in Greek Geometric art. Its casual pose has the im- mediacy of a passing mood or an idle activity, while its abstract symmetry hints of timeless symbolism. As a sculptural motif the figure appears too often to be merely anomalous and challenges us to explore its meaning. These mysterious sitters have long posed problems of interpretation.' Not only has their mean- ing yet to be discovered, but their activity and even basic biological identity are debated. A systematic ex- amination first of the primary evidence of the Geo- metric bronzes themselves and secondly of their larger historical and cultural context offers a possible answer to each of these questions. Twelve examples of the basic type are known from such widely scattered locations as Elis, Laconia, Ar- cadia, Euboea, Rhodes, and Central Italy. These fig- ures, catalogued below, form a thematically cohesive group characterized by attenuated anatomy and seated pose with elbows on knees and hands to mouth or face. Variations may give the figure a rounded object to hold (4, 7, 11, figs. 4, 7) or place the hands on the knees (1, 10, 12, figs. 1, 10). Most examples of this type sit on a stump or stool. A few are ithyphallic (1, 11, fig. 1). Despite such minor variations of pose, the type can be defined by its distinctive closed com- position. In the more abstractly rendered figures, such as those in figs. 3, 4, 5, and 7, the upright spine continues the vertical line of the seat and is reiterated in vertical shins and forearms; thighs and upper arms play off this orthogonality in oblique angles, leaving triangles of space. Hands connect with face or knees, feet with base; nothing projects from the compact form and perfect symmetry is achieved. The group further exhibits a fundamental stylistic unity, characterized by long cylindrical bodies and wiry limbs that curve into the pose. Heads tend to be large, while all proportions remain elongated. Limbs and torsos lack modeling and incised detail, and in- deed even hands and feet are simple terminations of tubular limbs. Most striking are the heads and faces. Although not all examples are equally detailed, they nevertheless share a distinctive heavy-browed trian- gular construction. The generic pose of the figures has generated much speculation regarding their activity. In certain figures (4, 5) the hands meet the face in a mass of bronze large enough to suggest a lumpy object being held to the mouth. This impression is confirmed by three * The present study is an expanded version of a paper presented at the 89th General Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America in New York, December 1987.

Schweitzer identified such figurines as drinking from flasks, which he in- terpreted as representing early satyrs or companions of Dionysos.2 Three related figures of post-Geometric date sit and play musical instruments, suggesting to some that the eighth-century type represents flute- players as well.3 A simian flute-player from Kameiros (fig. 11), illustrated here for the first time,4 holds a long flute and carries its case on his back.

The meager excavation evidence for these figurines places them generally near the end of the Geometric period, ca. 750-700 B.C. The dates of these few ex- cavated contexts are vague owing to both imprecise early recording systems and to the deposition of such offerings in votive pits along with later and possibly earlier material.

The Mavriki bronze (3, fig. 3) was found with small bronze votives of types related to the Tegea bronzes. The Olympia and Eretria figurines (1 and 5, figs. 1, 5) have no recorded contexts from their late 19th- century excavations. The Kameiros sitter (6, fig. 6) came from a votive deposit of mixed eighth- and seventh-century offerings. While none of these contexts secures an unequiv- ocal eighth-century date for the type, their base forms correspond with those of bronze animal figurines, the relative chronology of which is known from thousands of examples from Olympia. Heilmeyer dates to about 750 the "mannered, Ortheia-type" Laconian horses at Olympia whose pierced bases match those of the Ortheia and Eretria figures (figs. 4, 5). To this type also belong the stylized long-legged Laconian birds, one of which has a base like that of the Olympia seated figure.20 The four-swastika intaglio device on the base of 10 from Mersin parallels those of a bronze lion- '19 AO 197.

The provenience of the figurines, when known, offers important information. All figurines of re- corded context come exclusively from sanctuaries: Olympia, the sanctuaries of Athena Alea at Tegea and Artemis at Mavriki, of Ortheia at Sparta and Athena at Kameiros, and possibly of Apollo at Eretria. Thus, the seated type should be considered in the context of a motif intended for votive offering. As an example of Geometric sanctuary art this fi- gural motif follows an unusual course of develop- ment, apparently inspiring in the late eighth century a popular amuletic form worn as bronze pendants.

These figures bear an obvious formal affinity to the bronze figurines: they squat on their small bases, with legs pulled in toward the body and hands raised to the face, elbows propped on knees. The head projects in a triangular form with rounded ears or eyes and a prominent pointed muzzle around which the hands are wrapped. Often referred to as "jug-stoppers," such ornate objects were once suggested to have func- tioned as corks by means of cording wrapped around the shaft.23 Excavated examples have revised this as- sessment: several examples have been recorded in situ at the waists of skeletons, thus confirming their func- tion as decorative belt pendants.24 Scores of such pen- dants are known, among which can be traced a stylistic evolution of the figure from a relative naturalism to a flattened, angular abstraction so extreme as to be unrecognizable as an anthropoid figure.25 Accom- panying the change in figure style is a similar devel- opment of the shaft, in which the knobs gradually flatten and fuse together until they become little more than cut-outs along a cylindrical tube.26 Whether this stylistic development reflects a consis- tent linear evolution has not been clearly demon- strated, since few of the pendants come from datable contexts. The steady simplification of form seems to have been an inevitable result of the mass production of a basically complicated object. Since different styl- istic stages are documented from widely distributed sites, it is unlikely that varying forms reflect imitations increasingly distant from an original source. Similarly, an entire stylistic range may occur at a single site. Pherai, for example, has yielded five examples of the naturalistic sitters, two of an intermediate form, and four examples of the most abstract pendants. The earliest datable example, a quite naturalistic '"jug-stop- per" from Kuci Zi, Albania, sets the beginning of the sequence at ca. 700 B.C. or shortly before.27 The formal development of the type was accompanied by changes in use, for significantly, the pendant groups have been found in graves as well as sanctuaries. A second pendant type, belonging to the larger category of "bird-cage pendants," features a figure perched on a crossbar with hands on knees, the whole surmounting an openwork sphere.28 On these sitters details are few, usually including only incised eye circles, sometimes belts, "suspenders," and striated hair. Of the five examples known, four sit with their hands on their knees in the same pose as figurine 1 (fig. 1), and the fifth clasps one hand to his head, the other on his knee.29 One is ithyphallic.A0 Although none of these seven pendants has a known findspot beyond a general site, of 61 related "bird-cage" pen- dants 22 come from graves and 21 from sanctuaries; the rest are without provenience. The occurrence of seated figure pendants in graves is even more striking among the rod pendants; of the 128 catalogued by Kilian-Dirlmeier, up to 49 are from graves, as opposed to 13 from sanctuaries and 66 without provenience. The origin and distribution of both pendant types occur almost exclusively in northern Greece.31 Al- 23 U. Jantzen, "Geometrische Kannenverschliisse," AA 68 (1953) 56-67; Schweitzer 160-61. 24 C.

Bouzek sets the figural cage pendants little before the mid- seventh century and the men on cages in particular possibly as late as the sixth century on the basis of the globe form and stylistic features of the sitters. These figures, sharing as they do certain features with the most naturalistic (and earliest) of the jug-stoppers (belts, X on back, striated hair) must represent a western Macedonian adaptation of the earlier and primarily Macedonian rod pendant sitters. The artistic motif of the seated figure thus can be traced from south to north, from sanctuary to funer- ary contexts where it enjoyed a renewed and even increased popularity after 700. Over 130 such figural rod pendants are known, as compared with only a dozen Geometric figurines. The funerary contexts of many related northern Greek pendants provide a clue to the meaning of the mysterious figure. Not only does this alone of all Geometric anthropomorphic bronze figural types appear in graves, but in several of the most naturalistic examples the rod below was broken away and the figure saved, suggesting an amu- letic function rather than mere ornamentation.33 Bronze figurine 8 (fig. 8) of the larger Geometric type may have been manufactured as a pendant. Although it has no visible means of suspension, beneath its rectangular base projects a small rounded lug much like the ball or knob at the bottom of '"jug-stopper" shafts. An unparalleled base form for a figurine, it may reflect a reverse influence from the northern pendants into south Greek bronzeworking. In order to understand what processes were at work in the invention and diffusion of these figurines and pen- dants, we must investigate the seated figure's identity, source, and meaning. IDENTITY: THE MISSING LINK The common denominator of these three types of objects-the independent figurines and the cage and rod pendants-is more than simply thematic. Very few of the figures represented look fully human; most share a certain ambiguity in their physical features that transcends even the vagaries of Geometric figu- rine style. Their appearance has suggested demons,34 satyrs,35 apes,36 even grasshoppers,37 but most scholars have concluded that the figures represent men.38 The significant point is the frequent hesitation over their basic identity, an uncertainty that does not occur in discussion of other Geometric figurines. Is it a man or an animal that is intended? Heads are pyramidally constructed with spherical crania, often projecting ears, and always long protruding chins; in 5, 6, and 11 (figs. 5, 6) the lower face seems quite clearly to be a muzzle. A heavy brow is indicated usually as a ridge (e.g. 5, 7, 11), sometimes with a groove (e.g. 1, 4), in either case distinguishing brow from face in a way unparalleled among other Geo- metric human figurines not of this series. Similarly, all the seated figures' limbs, and especially their arms, are stretched well beyond the attenuated limits of normal period style. Although there are obvious dif- ferences among the examples, one can consistently recognize a basic identity that is not purely human. It is not coincidental that these features are chiefly those that distinguish men from the lower primates. Neither do the Geometric images, however, clearly depict monkeys or apes. None have tails, for instance, nor do any show sufficient detailing of the face to set them clearly in the primate order. These figures are differ- entiated from simian creatures not merely because Geometric art lacks sufficient naturalism, but because their significance was best expressed through an in- tentional ambiguity. The splendid figurine in Balti- more (7), for example, with its emphatic browline and hollowed eyes is anything but an inept rendering of monkey or human being.

Rock crystal monkey from Knossos, MM I. (Courtesy British School at Athens) clarify the meaning of the image or distinguish earlier from later incidences of the motif. A systematic review of examples and contexts yields new dimensions in the development of an artistic idea and potent symbol. In the Aegean world the popularity of seated simian figures as an artistic motif dates back to Pre-palatial Crete, where they were rendered in stone pendants and the handles of ivory seals, squatting with hands on knees or held to the face (fig. 13).40 The earring from the Aigina Treasure presents addorsed baboons squatting with hands to faces, apparently eating, and points toward the motif's ultimate origin.41 The prob- lematic treasure has been attributed to various cul- tures, ranging from 17th-century Minoan Crete to Phoenicia to the seventh-century Greek mainland.42 Beyond question, however, is the ultimately Egyptian inspiration of the piece, as seen in a similar pendant composition of the 12th Dynasty from Dahshur.43 The sacred hamadryas baboon (popularly called cyno- cephalus) was ubiquitous in Egyptian art as a repre- sentative of Thoth, who merged with an indigenous baboon god upon the arrival of Thoth's cult into Khemenu (later Greek Hermopolis). This assimilation was readily made by the Egyptians apparently because the baboon's loud feeding behavior at dawn seemed to mark the moon god's daily retirement, and since the animal appeared to be affected by the moon's phases.44 Although Thoth was not the only deity with whom the baboon was connected, it was as his repre- sentative, depicted in formal squatting pose clasping its knees, eating fruit, or with hands raised to greet the sun, that the animal occurred most frequently in art. In addition to Thoth's roles as scribe, healer, and overseer of justice in the Underworld, baboons em- bodied the force of protective magic. As such, their images were carried as amulets and decorated magic knives and rods. They frequently appeared on cos- metic objects, as did monkeys, to symbolize eroticism, fertility, and regeneration.45 But while monkeys were merely symbols, only baboons had religious signifi- cance. An ode to Thoth is addressed to a small baboon figurine inlaid with fine stones and with a quartz phallus, praising the deity for bringing happiness on the house.46 The ferocious phallic baboon god Babi represented the violent side of the animal's ithyphallic inclinations.47 While actual simians may well have been imported into Bronze Age Crete,48 artistic similarities suggest that Minoan craftsmen were imitating popular Egyp- tian baboon amulets (fig. 14).49 A 12th Dynasty Egyp- 40 J.N.

From MM III onwards the mon- key interacts with human or divine beings in compositions suggesting worship, playing a new role as intercessor between mortals and gods.52 The pro- motion of the animal from zoological curiosity to iconographic necessity may have been aided by a greater acquaintance with Egyptian art and religion in the MM III-LM period.53 The raised status of these later Minoan monkeys and apes may recall Thoth's assisting roles as conciliator among gods, as psycho- pomp, and as advocate of the deceased in the Under- world. Whether the Minoans made an iconographic distinction between smaller monkeys of various gen- era and the sacred hamadryas baboons is uncertain; their representations vary in precision and apparently in species. For the New Palace age, with its far-reaching activ- ities and contacts, other sources for the motif in ad- dition to Egypt have to be considered. The long history of the simian motif in the art of the Near East began in the fourth millennium and continued in a variety of forms and media.54 Since monkeys and baboons are not indigenous to Mesopotamia and the Levant, the source of these early images, and presum- ably of actual animals, may be sought in Harappan India, where the close resemblance of monkey figu- rines to examples from Sumerian and Elamite con- texts has been remarked.55 Particularly in glyptic representations, simian creatures accompany deities in a manner reminiscent of those in Cretan art and may have been models for the developing Minoan iconography. A long-tailed monkey squatting among gods and worshippers was a standard element of Old Babylonian and Syro-Cappadocian cylinder seals,56 50 CMS II, 1, 516 no. 435. 5' B.J. Kemp and R.S.

Although they were demonstrably familiar with the image, there are no known Mycenaean mon- key representations.58 Squatting anthropoid figurines first appear in Greece in the eighth century. The perseverence and increasingly broad distribution of a seated simian motif further attest its special meaning. Apart from the bronzes, squatting monkey figures were popular in Greece down into the sixth century in ivory, bone, terracotta, and faience. Examples from graves and sanctuaries at Sparta, Ithaca, Fortetsa, Perachora, Thebes, and elsewhere testify to the wide- spread and enduring popularity of the motif, of which variations include flute-players, mothers holding in- fants, and other seated activities.59 An unpublished Geometric terracotta figurine excavated from a grave in the Attic cemetery at Merenda, now in the Brauron Museum, depicts a seated monkey with hands on knees, the entire figure painted black to represent fur. The close relationship between simians and satyrs as comical human caricatures in sixth-century painting has recently been demonstrated.60 The "international" ports of Samos and especially Rhodes must have played an active part in the diffu- sion of this image into Greece during the eighth and seventh centuries. From the Samian sanctuary of Hera an Egyptian type of squatting faience baboon with hand held to mouth, ivory scarabs with baboon hieroglyphs, and a terracotta baboon seated with hands propped against its face demonstrate a variety of media for the transmission of the theme."' Votive deposits at Kameiros and Lindos have yielded, in addition to two Geometric bronze versions, a substan- tial number of squatting monkey figurines in various materials, both Egyptian imports and Phoenician or - Fig. 15.

Fibulae were formed as horses with monkeys on their backs.67 Elaborate horse trappings feature apes in various poses and groupings.68 Simian creatures perch on the legs and handles of vessels.69 The Etruscan creatures, in contrast with most of their Greek counterparts, are much more numerous and look purely zoomorphic. Clearly the Etruscans were receiving and imitating the motif directly from the Eastern source and not via Greece. Indeed, the begin- nings of Etruscan Orientalizing style owed a greater debt to Phoenician motifs than did the Greek Orien- talizing with its early preponderance of North Syrian influence. The simian motif in Etruria always adhered more closely to the original naturalistic model of the Phoenicians, without the veil of human-animal am- biguity of Greek interpretations. Small Egyptian or Egyptianizing amulets that passed through Phoeni- cian hands helped transmit the image into Italy. In fact, the earliest foreign imports in Etruria seem to be small amulets and figurines of Egyptian faience, possibly used in much the same way as "trade beads" of recent times.70 Egyptianizing seated baboon amu- lets in the squatting pose with hands pressed to mouth were particularly abundant at Carthage.7' At the other end of the route, evidence for the baboon and monkey in contemporary Levantine art confirms that the source of these pervasive Iron Age images lay in the Near East. Over several millennia the monkey was depicted in Near Eastern art as mu- sician, pet, and entertainer,72 but it was particularly among the Phoenicians and within their sphere of influence that artistic representations took on a more complex interpretation. Pictorial relief and ancient biblical texts attest that the Phoenicians imported monkeys and baboons from India and traded them as valuable gifts,73 so that the actual appearance and behavior of the animals was a resource available to artists. Such a circumstance makes all the more sug- gestive those representations that are based on Egyp- tian images. The Phoenician adaptation of the Egyptian Bes cult for the demi-god's fertility and apotropaic prowess frequently found expression in images of Bes accompanied by baboons or smaller monkeys, usually perched on his shoulders.7' His role as protector of human fecundity was emphasized through the explicit fertility image of the god nursing Horus or infant Bes under the watchful eyes of ba- boons (fig. 15).75 That the simians could symbolize fertility without Bes is demonstrated by depictions connecting them with a goddess holding her breasts, bin, The Greeks and Their Eastern Neighbors (London 1957) 49; V.

The path from this commercial entrep6t to the heart of the Peloponnese with its earliest bronze seated figures is less easy to follow. It is significant that most examples of free- standing seated bronze figures with known proveni- ence cluster in the lower Peloponnese at Sparta (4), Tegea (2), Mavriki (3), Olympia (1), and the Alpheios Valley (7). In fact, it is possible to draw the net tighter and attribute the origin of the type to Laconia in general and perhaps to Sparta in particular. Stylistic details closely link the figures: those from known sites in the region all share round bases (1-4), a form not found in any other Geometric anthropo- morphic sculptures. The square base of the Ashmo- lean figure (10) can be drawn into this circle on the basis of its four relief swastikas, which are paralleled in a bronze group from Samos with close affiliations to Laconian style.8' The head of the seated bronze from Olympia (1) finds a striking counterpart in a terracotta head vase from Sparta.82 Furthermore, the underside of the Olympia figure's base, a circle ringed with crescents, is indirectly linked to Sparta through the similar base of a bronze bird from Olympia with a parallel bird from the Menelaion.83 While the char- acter of Arcadian bronzes is generally independent, Laconian influence was clearly present; certainly the sitting figure from Tegea (2) finds its nearest relatives in the Alpheios Valley and Olympia bronzes (1, 7), and that from Mavriki (3) in the figure from Sparta (4). Numerous bronze animal figurines at Lusoi, Te- gea, and Bassai84 attest the transmission of eighth- century Spartan bronze art into Arcadia. The preva- lence of Laconian bronzes among Olympian animal votives in the second quarter of the eighth century recalls the tradition of the treaty of the Ekechaeiria, which produced a Spartan alliance with Elis in the time of the earliest Olympic games. If these bronze animal offerings indeed demonstrate a Laconian dominance at Olympia between 776 and 740 B.C., the seated Olympian figure becomes an even more plau- sible Laconian product. Although the provenience of the figure now in Chieti (9) is unknown, and Etruscan seated monkey figures were common in Central Italy, its closest stylistic affinity is with the bronze from Sparta (4). On various grounds Canciani has proposed for it an attribution to Tarentum, a Spartan colony that retained close ties to its mother city.85 To understand how Sparta became the home of the Geometric seated figure requires a certain amount of speculation. The arrival of the monkey image on the wave of Phoenician travel can be traced at major points of contact: Rhodes, Samos, Etruria, and Car- thage. As a way station along this route, Laconia would not require a substantial detour. One attraction for the Levantine merchants might have been the abun- dance of murex for dye available at Kythera; the iron mines in the peninsula would have offered another.86 The evidence for Phoenicians at or near Sparta has recently been discussed but without firm conclu- sions.87 Obviously, objects of Phoenician or Egyptian manufacture found in Late Geometric and Laconian I contexts at the sanctuary of Ortheia do not neces- sarily prove foreign presence at the site.88 The ivory carvings for which the Spartans became famous, ter- Morris, The Black and White Style [New Haven 1984] 61-62, pl. 13) and on a fragment from Aigina, AM 22 (1897) 309 fig. 31b.

Into this picture the image of the sitting monkey fits quite naturally,89 and indeed continued to delight the Spartans down into the sixth century, as shown by a terracotta aryballos in the form of a squatting simian and bronze vessel handles punctuated with mon- keys.90 It is possible that such elements entered Laconian culture by a number of avenues: through foreign merchants calling at the ports, through itinerant craftsmen accompanying raw materials (in particular ivory tusks) into Laconia, and indirectly, through the "grapevine" of other Greeks dwelling in such foreign parts as Al Mina. Study of the Orientalizing Spartan ivories has suggested that their craftsmen acquired both ivory and artistic inspiration on Samos, where they certainly saw North Syrian work.9' Indeed, the ivory reclining quadrupeds found at the Ortheia sanc- tuary in the level of the bronze seated figurine are derived from Near Eastern seals.92 The large amount of Laconian pottery found in the Samian Heraion, some possibly as early as the eighth century, admits the possibility of the Laconian Geometric bronze- workers also receiving inspiration here, perhaps along with copper and tin. Similarly, the occurrence of a Geometric bronze seated figurine at Eretria may il- lustrate another such connection with Laconian Greeks who were, like the Euboeans, long experi- enced with Levantine trade. Perhaps the most provocative evidence comes from the series of terracotta masks, nearly unique in Greece, that were created for the cult of Ortheia. A recent study marshals extensive evidence toward the intriguing conclusion that the cult was Phoenician in origin,91 a suggestion that recalls the ancient claim of a Phoenician temple on the island of Kythera.94 Al- though none of the masks dates much before 650, the foundation of the cult is securely placed in the eighth century. The development of masks in imitation of Phoenician originals from the seventh century on would indicate a continuing contact with the source, and suggests a ritual drama enacted on an Eastern pattern. It is worthwhile considering whether the Geometric bronze seated figurines possibly invented here might actually represent men wearing monkey masks, creating a uniquely Greek demonic form un- der the inspiration of Eastern art and ritual within the context of a fertility cult. Significantly, the seated figures of Peloponnesian origin look more "human" than those from Eretria and Rhodes, which in contrast are quite simian. Such regional trends certainly indi- cate differing interpretations of a borrowed motif. How the image moved north in the seventh century and into another form, the rod pendant, can be read- ily surmised. It is not surprising to see a class of mainstream votive art from the Peloponnese making its way northward a little later than its brief career in bronze in the south, since Laconian objects were trav- eling widely in the seventh century. Even for the eighth century such connections are readily found. Bouzek has noted that although figural bronzes are rare in the north, the horses and birds of Thessalian production imitate Peloponnesian styles, specifically Corinthian for the horses, Corinthian and Laconian for the birds.95 A genuine Peloponnesian import at Pherai and Thessalian bronzes in Delphi trace the route of exchange that ideas and images followed through central Greece. The northern Greek sanc- tuaries of Dodona, Pherai, and Philia may have pro- vided for the seated figure the vital link from south to north. With their large quantity of bronze votive offerings, they constitute both the northernmost bul- wark of canonical Geometric sanctuaries and the southernmost line of '"jug-stopper" distribution. Ex- amples of these pendants with seated figures have been found at all three sites.96 CONCLUSION: THE MEANING OF THE FIGURE It is not difficult to envision the monkey image arriving in Greece through curios from travelers and merchant contacts, and spawning copies in bronze in the sleek current artistic idiom of the eighth century.

For the Greek world he favored a secular interpretation, viewing the chief interest in the primate as primarily a "source of humor." Published in 1938, his impressive study ex- cluded the Greek Geometric bronze figurines and pendants, and therefore of the implications raised by their introduction into Greece directly and solely within the contexts of sanctuary deposits and graves. Sparked by North Syrian and Phoenician contacts, the arrival of the seated figure motif into eighth- century Greece was perhaps indirect: through a for- eign amulet passed from hand to hand, accompanied by stories of a human-like creature with remarkable physical prowess, or perhaps through the unforget- table image of animal entertainments glimpsed in the carnival atmosphere of the great Mediterranean ports. Probably along with the stories came the Near Eastern association of monkeys and baboons with fer- tility properties. The ithyphallicism encountered among the Geometric seated figurines and pendants is a new iconographic feature in Greece not found in Bronze Age art. It may have been inspired by foreign representations that emphasized the animal's geni- talia.98 The fertility significance embodied in these Greek seated figures would have made them appro- priate offerings for sanctuaries, companions to the bronze Geometric animal figurines that likely sym- bolized prayers for the prosperity of animal life. In turn, this function engendered a popularity of the figure in pendant form, worn as a hopeful amulet to the grave and probably in life as well. The rather incomprehensible form of the studded rod pendant below the seated figure may perhaps be explained as a stylized version of the Tree of Life with a squatting monkey in its branches sometimes found in Levantine ivories. Indeed, the compact angularity of the sitter is a form more akin to the glyptic art of ivory-carving then to the freer modeling of bronzeworking, even as exemplified in the Geometric seated figurines.99 Adopting the eating or drinking pose ultimately of Egyptian baboons and Near Eastern monkeys, this image of nourishment supplemented the developing popular iconography of fertility and regeneration in the Geometric period. The history of the monkey motif in the Bronze Age and early Iron Age Aegean unites two discrete but essentially related Orientalizing phenomena. The ear- lier introduction into Minoan Crete of the simian as an artistic and eventually iconographic motif origi- nated directly in Egyptian baboon and Near Eastern monkey images. In the second, eighth-century recur- rence engendered chiefly by North Syrian and Phoen- ician art, the squatting figure carried those cultures' interpretation of the motif. The Greeks at this time would only rarely have seen monkeys, and probably knew of the animals chiefly through verbal descrip- tion and artistic representation. What caught their imagination was the richly complex lore of the beast, the quasi-religious status of the sacred Egyptian ba- boon combined with the mystery of the animal as the Levantine world knew it, a potent symbol of fertility, a natural mirror for man. Nor was the phenomenon of adaptation complete until the image was trans- formed to express the meanings laden on it. The Geometric figurines cannot be understood as simple monkeys, but rather as an intentional mixture of hu- man and simian elements whose symbolic activity orig- inated in natural animal behavior. The monkey's tail was suppressed, the brow slightly diminished, the nose made more human. By the seventh century the image was refracted through the prism of experience and took on a predominantly secular enjoyment of the real animal. Artists of ceramics, terracotta, ivory, and faience turned the monkeys into musicians, jar- carriers, mothers, buffoons, and beasts of burden, and reinstated their animal appearance. The Geo- metric icon of fertility and regeneration was remem- bered only in the bronze pendants worn in Thessaly and Macedonia. For the rest of the Greek world, the mysterious anthropoid creature had descended from protector to entertainer, from a gift for a god to a popular whimsy. The Geometric bronze seated figures, however, be- long to the earlier world. While not monkeys or ba- boons, neither are they purely human, but illustrate the creation of a novel if short-lived creature to enrich the early Greek bestiary.

But unlike those creatures whose com- ponent human and animal parts remained distinct, this Mischwesen was fully integrated into a new being.
