<plain_text><page sequence="1">Article THE VALUE PROBLEM IN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS Lessons From the Physiocrats and Marx PAULBURKETT Indiana State University Perhaps the most vexing question in ecological economics is whether nature is a direct source and/or substance of value. One group ascribes value directly to natural resources and argues that monetary exchange values (prices and profits) largely orfully represent the val ues extracted from nature. Another group focuses on nature as an objective condition or basis for value defined as psychic income or "enjoyment of life. " This article applies Marx's critique of the Physiocrats to this contemporary debate. It is suggested that both groups of ecological economists do not adequately consider the relations between use value and capi talist valuation. Ai a result, both are fundamentally uncritical toward market forms of nature valuation and fail to distinguish between environmental crises of capitalist reproduction and capitalistically induced crises in the natural conditions of human development. Marx's dia lectical approach to nature, value, and use value provides a potential way out of this impasse. Keywords: value; use value; capital; energy; entropy; Physiocracy One's view of nature's economic value helps shape one's conceptions of nature's role in production and of environmental crises. Given the diffi cult issues raised by the question of economic value, however, nature's value in par ticular has long vexed economists. This applies especially to contemporary ecolog ical economics, which "addresses the relationships between eco-systems and economic systems in the broadest sense" and—quite appropriately given the com plexity of this subject matter—maintains a strong commitment to methodological pluralism (Costanza, 1989, p. 1 ; cf. Norgaard, 1989a). Nonetheless, among ecolog ical economists, two broad positions on nature's value seem to have emerged. One ascribes value directly to natural resources. Although this position has been led by the energy value school, it also includes eco-Sraffian and eco-Marxist theorists who argue that monetary exchange values (prices and profits) largely or fully represent the values extracted from nature in general. Opposing such natural value analyses is a second broad perspective that focuses on nature—especially low-entropy matter and energy—as an objective condition or basis for value defined as psychic income or "enjoyment of life." The present article interprets this value controversy from the standpoint of Marx's critique of the Physiocrats.

Accordingly, after outlining the competing views of ecological economists on nature's value, the present article reviews the basic elements of the Physiocratic system. It is shown that Physiocratic thought is a complex hybrid of the positions held by ecological economists. Interestingly, Marx criticized the Physiocrats not for emphasizing nature as a source of wealth or use value but for conflating capital ist value with its natural basis. Indeed, he critically incorporated important ele ments of Physiocracy into his own analysis of value and capital accumulation. Marx's analysis of the Physiocrats is then applied to the controversy among eco logical economists regarding nature's value. It is argued that like the Physiocrats, both sides in this debate do not adequately consider the relations between use value and capitalist valuation. As a result, both sides are fundamentally uncritical toward market forms of nature valuation, and both sides fail to distinguish between envi ronmental crises of capitalist reproduction and capitalistically induced crises in the natural conditions of human development. The article concludes by suggesting that Marx's dialectical approach to nature, value, and use value provides a potential way out of this analytical impasse. NATURE'S VALUE: VIEWS OF ECOLOGICAL ECONOMISTS Ecological economists share a deep concern with the role of limited natural con ditions in human production (Costanza, 1989; Daly, 1992b; Hay, 2002, pp. 233 242). By contrast with neoclassical economics, they insist that production is dependent on unproducible resources that cannot be substituted for by human labor and technology. The main issue in the value debate among ecological economists is whether ascribing economic value directly to nature is the most logical and useful way to build this concern with limited natural conditions into analyses of market valuations of nature and contemporary environmental problems. Nature as a Direct Source and Substance of Value One group of ecological economists treats nature as a direct source and sub stance of value. This line of thinking has been led by the "embodied energy" theo rists, who argue that the "primary input" into production is energy. Because " 'free' or 'available' energy" is required for the production of all goods and services and cannot be substituted for by other inputs, it is viewed as "the only 'basic' commod ity and ... ultimately the only 'scarce' factor of production" (Färber, Costanza, &amp; Wilson, 2002, p. 382): An energy theory of value posits that, at least at the global scale, free or available energy from the sun (plus past solar energy stored as fossil fuels and residual heat from the earth's core) are the only "primary" inputs to the system. Labor, manufac tured capital, and natural capital are "intermediate inputs." Thus, one could base a theory of value on the use in production of available energy. (Farber et al., 2002, p. 383)' The presumption here is that "a production-based theory that can explain exchange values" must grant a logical or chronological primacy to one particular input of material production (Farber et al., 2002, p. 382). It is also presumed that the</page><page sequence="3">Burkett / VALUE IN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS 139 main purpose of value theory is to "explain exchange values [market prices] in eco nomic systems" (Farber et al., 2002, p. 383).2 In short, the embodied energy theory "is really a cost of production theory with all costs carried back to the solar energy necessary directly and indirectly to produce them" (Costanza, 1980, p. 1224). The approach closely and consciously parallels the Ricardian labor-embodied theory of value, with energy replacing labor as the primary factor of production (Farber et al., 2002, pp. 376-377, 382-383). Given the parallel just mentioned, it is not surprising that one of the main meth ods used to test the energy theory has been the Sraffian input-output analysis of price determination (Sraffa, 1960). Indeed, Mayumi (2001, pp. 65-66) showed that the embodied energy input-output framework is formally identical to the Sraffa sys tem expressed in current and dated labor terms. The only difference is that the energy system replaces the direct and indirect labor requirements of the various sectors' outputs with their direct and indirect energy requirements (cf. Judson, 1989, pp. 267-268). Applying the energy-accounting framework to U.S. data, the energy analysts have found strong statistical correlations between the monetary values of sectoral outputs and the amounts of energy directly and indirectly embod ied in these outputs (Costanza, 1980, 1981a). Other, more aggregative analyses investigate the correlation between the total energy consumed by national produc tion (controlling for fuel quality as proxied by the shares of energy obtained from different sources) and monetary value added as measured by GDP or GNP. Such studies have found relatively stable or at least predictable ratios of aggregate energy consumption to aggregate monetary value added in the United States and other industrialized economies (Cleveland, Costanza, Hall, &amp; Kaufmann, 1984; Kaufmann, 1992). Although three proponents conclude that the "energy theory of value ... seems to be the only reasonably successful attempt to operationalize a general biophysical theory of value" (Farber et al., 2002, p. 384), the approach "has been strongly criti cized for its failure to recognize the importance of unique characteristics of matter and the operation of 'other' factors in the economic system apart from energy con straints" (Judson, 1989, p. 266). This rejection of "energy as the sole cause of value" (Judson, 1989, p. 268) has developed along three analytical tracks. Opposing the purported "convergence between the Neo-Ricardian and embod ied energy approaches to economic valuation" (Judson, 1989, p. 267), the first track uses Sraffian input-output models to analyze the determination of market exchange values (and related issues of distributional conflict and economic crises) but with out treating any single primary input as the unique source of value.3 From the per spective of these models, the notion of energy as the prime factor of production hinges on external presumptions about the reproducibility of other factors—specif ically the arbitrary reduction of their reproduction to pure energetics.4 One cannot use Sraffian models to argue "that labour creates value and is exploited, rather than any other input, e.g., corn, iron or energy" (Saad-Filho, 2002, p. 24). In the same way, Sraffian analysis provides some support for those who argue that ecological economics should "do without a general theory of value" in the sense of uniquely ascribing value to energy or any other "primary input" (Martinez-Alier &amp; Naredo, 1982, p. 219).5 The eco-Sraffian view thus posits that production and monetary exchange values depend on "labor, resources, and envi ronmental services" in all their physical and biological diversity (Gowdy, 1988, p. 38). In this broader sense, it still treats nature as a direct source of value. A second track is interested in "generalizing" the Marxist theory of exploitation to include not just the exploitation of labor but of nature as well. Because Marx's</page><page sequence="4">140 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2003 analysis of labor exploitation is developed in terms of the category surplus value, this "eco-Marxist" project has necessarily involved the treatment of nature itself as a source of value and surplus value. However, eco-Marxists, unlike the energy value theorists, do not conceptualize natural resource use in purely energetic terms, or they at least argue that production is reducible to energy processing only at a highly abstract level. In their view, nature exploitation involves the extraction of profit from biologically and physically variegated ecosystems; it thus calls not for an energy theory of value but for a genuinely "biophysical" or "bioenergetic" theory of value (Deléage, 1994, pp. 48-50; Salleh, 1997, p. 154). Skirbekk (1994), for example, argued that insofar as capitalism takes more wealth out of nature than it puts back in, it is "an extractive form of production" in which "value is transferred from resources to profits" (p. 100). He suggested that this "extractive surplus profit" allows "the entire production process, at all levels" to "receive more value .. . than the labor itself has created" (p. 100). Such value extraction then takes the form of higher monetary incomes for capitalists and/or workers—higher incomes obtained at the expense of "nature, and, indirectly, future generations" (p. 101). Similarly, Brennan (1997) argued that capitalism exploits nature whenever "natural substances" are "used up faster than they can reproduce themselves" (p. 185). Nature as a Basis for "Enjoyment of Life" The third track rejecting energy value analysis has been led by the renowned ecological economists Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Herman Daly. Their cri tique has two components. First, like the first two tracks, Georgescu-Roegen and Daly argued against the reduction of production to energetics. They pointed out that production of useful goods and services involves not only energy but also qualita tively diverse material stocks and flows, and this makes variegated forms of pur poseful human activity and ingenuity—of labor, science, and technology—essen tial elements of the process (Daly, 1992b, pp. 216-217).6 Although all production requires energy, "matter matters too" in the irreducible sense that "at the macro level no practical procedure exists for converting energy into matter or matter of whatever form into energy" (Georgescu-Roegen, 1979, p. 1040; cf. Daly, 1992b, p. 25). Secondly, and unlike the first two tracks, Georgescu-Roegen and Daly did not ascribe economic value directly to nature. Instead, they treated nature as one essen tial basis or condition (along with human activity and human knowledge) for the production of goods and services that enhance value, with value defined in immate rial use value terms as "enjoyment of life" (Georgescu-Roegen, 1973, p. 53; 1979, p. 1042; see Daly, 1981, p. 168; 1992b, p. 36). Georgescu-Roegen and Daly developed these two points largely through an application of the laws of thermodynamics, starting with the observation that pro duction "neither produces nor consumes matter-energy; it only absorbs matter energy and throws it out continuously" (Georgescu-Roegen, 1973, p. 50). Then, appealing to the entropy law, they argued that production involves the conversion of matter and energy from more ordered (and thus more useful) forms into less ordered (and less useful) forms.7 In short, "the ultimate usable stuff of the universe is low-entropy matter-energy ... and it exists in two forms: a terrestrial stock and a solar flow," both of which are limited (even if some stocks of low-entropy matter energy are "renewable on a human time scale") (Daly, 1992b, p. 21). Low-entropy matter-energy thus appears as the ultimate input of, and constraint on, production— implying that at some point the global economy will have to adjust to a "steady</page><page sequence="5">Burkett / VALUE IN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS 141 state" to ensure its own reproducibility (Daly, 1974; Georgescu-Roegen, 1973, pp. 53-54, 58). In opposing energetic value analysis, however, Georgescu-Roegen and Daly denied that production can be reduced to pure energetic, or even pure entropie, terms. As Georgescu-Roegen (1979) put it, "it would be a great mistake to think that [production] may be represented by a vast system of thermodynamic equations— The entropie process moves through an intricate web of anthropomorphic catego ries, of utility and labor, above all" (p. 1042). Similarly, Daly (1992b) observed that "all low entropy cannot be treated alike": Alternative low-entropy matter-energy sources differ greatly in terms of their appropriateness for the qualitatively diverse material and energy conversions required by human production and consumption (p. 25). Accordingly, Georgescu-Roegen and Daly defined value not in terms of the pri macy of any one or several factors of production but as the "end-product" of pro duction from the standpoint of human needs and wants. From this perspective, the "true product" of production "is not a physical flow of dissipated matter and energy, but the enjoyment of life—account being also taken of the drudgery of labor" (Georgescu-Roegen, 1979, p. 1042).8 Value is thus defined as "psychic income" (Daly, 1992b, pp. 31-36), "an immaterial flux" for which low-entropy matter energy and purposeful human labor are fundamental preconditions (Georgescu Roegen, 1973, p. 53). Stated differently, "Service (net psychic income) is the final benefit of economic activity. Throughput (an entropie physical flow) is the final cost" (Daly, 1992b, p. 36). NATURE, WEALTH, AND VALUE IN THE PHYSIOCRATS AND MARX Despite their view that "the land is the unique source of wealth" (Quesnay, 1767/ 1963c, p. 232), the Physiocrats have received little attention in the value contro versy among ecological economists. Cleveland (1987) suggested that the Physio crats' "steadfast belief that Nature was the source of wealth became a recurring theme throughout biophysical economics" (p. 50), but he did not elaborate on the parallel. Georgescu-Roegen (1976) characterized Physiocratic doctrine (referring specifically to Quesnay's Tableau Économique) as an "analytico-physiological approach," meaning "a manifest endeavor to submit the economic phenomena to a physiological analysis akin to that of biology" (p. 236). But he did not relate this methodological description to the question of nature's value. Similarly, in a sketch of "historical roots for ecological economics," Christensen (1989) included the Physiocrats (along with other preclassical and classical economists) among those who showed "an early attention to the physical side of economic activity" by using a "reproductive" approach that "regarded production in terms of the transformation of materials and food taken from the land" (p. 18). He did not consider value-theoretic questions, however, despite his assertion that Sraffian analysis is the logical heir to this earlier "reproductive" tradition (pp. 33-34). Apart from the general view among "most economists" that "the Physiocrats represent an historical curiosity" and nothing more (Cleveland, 1987, p. 50), per haps the main reason for their marginalization from the nature value debate is the dominant role played by thermodynamics and the energy theory of value in this debate. Indeed, that the Physiocrats predate the development of the laws of thermo dynamics may help explain why they have been largely written out of the history not only of ecological value analysis but of ecological economics in general. Thus,</page><page sequence="6">142 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2003 Martinez-Alier's (1987) influential history of ecological economics focuses exclu sively on those economists who "counted calories"; it therefore begins in the mid 1860s, "at a time when the laws of thermodynamics had been established"—the idea being that "not much is lost analytically by focusing on the use of energy as the central point in ecological economics" (p. 2). If one does not embrace this energy reductionist view of the subject, then the Physiocrats and the lessons to be learned from them could loom much larger. Elements of Physiocracy In the mid- 1700s, France was in the throes of a two-pronged crisis of economic development. Whereas the country's manufacturing sector was underdeveloped and inefficient compared to England's, French agriculture was held back by feudal production relations (featuring intensive exploitation of peasants and sharecrop pers by increasingly absentee landlords) and by a "multitude of taxes," including an onerous grain export tax, used to help finance a "series of disastrous wars, coupled with the extravagance of the Court" (Meek, 1963, p. 25; cf. Higgs, 1897/1952, pp. 5-11). Among the peasants, "revolts had become chronic" (Ware, 1931, p. 613). The Physiocrats tried to determine the causes of this crisis, and the best policies for overcoming it, through a discovery of the natural laws governing the production and distribution of wealth.9 Their "main aim was to illuminate the operation of the basic causes which determined the general level of economic activity," or "how to increase the national income of an under-developed country like France from a low level to a high one" (Meek, 1963, pp. 19,368; cf. Spengler, 1945b, p. 345). In sum, as stated by their great patriarch, François Quesnay (1767/1963c), the Physiocrats' goal was "to attain to the greatest degree of prosperity possible for the society" con sistent with "the general laws of the natural order" (p. 231 ). The way that the Physiocrats went about this investigation was affected both by their social position and by the personal biography of the school's founder and dominant figure, Quesnay. As Ware (1931) noted, "The Physiocrats were not pro fessional economists but officials of various sorts emerging from the French bureaucracy and climbing into the land-owning and even into the noble classes" (p. 608). Although the "new landed class" of which the Physiocrats were members "was not slow to acquire the aristocratic point of view," it was more bourgeois than the nobility it aped (pp. 608-609). This applies especially to the new landowners' attitude toward their agricultural estates, which they viewed in strongly business like terms. "Under the old landowners all that was required of the land was a living," but with the new landowners... the surplus was the sine qua non of economic activity, and no matter how attractive were the pursuits of the nobility and contacts with them, no bourgeois official of the State could rest content with non-surplus producing capital, (p. 609) The medical-scientific background of Quesnay (who had ascended to the nobil ity in 1755, on his purchase of a large estate in Nivernais) helped sharpen this latent focus on agriculture's surplus-producing potential in Physiocratic thought (Foley, 1973; Fox-Genovese, 1976, chap. 2). In addition to attending Madame de Pompa dour and Louis XV, Dr. Quesnay wrote extensively on human physiology, with emphasis on the circulation of blood and the need for an ultimate "premier force" to initiate and maintain this circulation (Banzhaf, 2000, p. 539; Christensen, 1994, pp.</page><page sequence="7">Burkett / VALUE IN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS 143 264-265). With this background, it is not surprising that the Physiocrats not only "believed that it was useful to conceive economic activity as taking the form of a sort of 'circle,' or circular flow as we would call it today," but also "endeavored to discover some key variable, movements in which could be regarded as the basic fac tor causing an expansion or contraction ... in the general level of economic activ ity" (Meek, 1963, p. 19; cf. Banzhaf, 2000, pp. 546-547). Given their status as bour geois landowners in a semifeudal, mercantilist system with an overtaxed agriculture and backward manufacturing, it was natural that the Physiocrats "found the economic primum mobile in the realm of agriculture," arguing that "upon its expansion depended that of everything else" (Spengler, 1945b, p. 320). Their theory was based on the land's unique capacity to generate means of sub sistence (Christensen, 1994, pp. 271-273). For the Physiocrats, nonagricultural production involves increases in the usefulness of the material means of subsis tence created by agriculture—"increase[s] brought about by combining raw materi als with expenditure on the consumption of things which were in existence prior to this kind of increase"; in this sense, nonagricultural production is "an adding together of items of wealth that are combined with one another" (Quesnay, 1766/ 1963b, p. 207). Agriculture, by contrast, entails an actual "generation or creation of wealth," insofar as it "constitutes a renewal and real [material] increase of renascent wealth" (Quesnay, 1766/1963b, p. 207). In fact, the Physiocrats identified both real wealth and economic value with the "subsistence and prime materials" generated by the land (Christensen, 1994, p. 272). As Turgot (1770/1898) said, The earth... is always the first and only source of all wealth; it is that which as the result of cultivation produces all the revenue; it is that also which has provided the first fund of advances prior to all cultivation, (p. 46)'° By definition, then, only agriculture can produce a "net product" or "superflu ity" of material means of subsistence over the amount required for the subsistence of the agricultural laborer (Turgot, 1770/1898, p. 9). However, even though this sur plus is "a pure gift" of nature, its production depends on human labor and ingenuity (Turgot, 1770/1898, p. 9).11 The net product "is the physical result of the fertility of the soil, and of the wisdom, far more than the laboriousness, of the means . . . employed to render it fertile"; it is thus "the labour of the Husbandman" that "pro duces more than his wants" and that appears as the source of an "independent and disposable" surplus "which the land gives as a pure gift to him who cultivates it" (Turgot, 1770/1898, p. 14). The Physiocrats thus treat agricultural labor as the prime mover of "the sequence of the labors divided among the different members of society." This is a "primacy... of physical necessity" in the sense that the material subsistence of nonagricultural laborers depends on the ability of the agricultural laborer to "produce over and above the wages of his labor" (Turgot, 1770/1898, p. 9). Because agriculture alone can yield a surplus of material means of subsistence, "it is... the labour of the Husbandman which imparts the first impulse" to the social division of labor: that "circulation, which, by the reciprocal exchange of wants, ren ders men necessary to one another and forms the bond of the society" (Turgot, 1770/1898, p. 7). It is true that cultivators and nonagricultural "artisans" are "equally industrious," but the cultivators' labor "produces, or rather draws from the land, riches which are continually springing up afresh, and which supply the whole society with its subsis tence and with the materials for all its needs"; artisans, on the other hand, are merely "occupied in giving to materials thus produced the preparations and the forms</page><page sequence="8">144 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2003 which render them suitable for the use of men" (Turgot, 1770/1898, p. 10). In short, "the Husbandman gathers, beyond his subsistence, a wealth which is independent and disposable, which he has not bought and which he sells," whereas in material terms, nonagricultural workers produce "only their livelihood" through their pro cessing of the material wealth provided by agriculture (Turgot, 1770/1898, p. 9). Allowing for the distinction between agricultural workers and landowners, the Physiocrats' famous division of society into the productive, proprietary, and sterile classes follows immediately from their basic vision of wealth production. The pro ductive class is of course "that which brings about the regeneration of the nation's wealth through the cultivation of its territory" (Quesnay, 1766/1963a, p. 150). "The class of proprietors" or landowners "subsists on the revenue or net product of culti vation." Finally, the sterile class is composed of all the citizens who are engaged in providing other ser vices or doing other work than that of agriculture, and whose expenses are paid by the productive class, and by the class of proprietors, which itself draws its revenue from the productive class. (Quesnay, 1766/1963a, p. 150) Quesnay presumed self-employed artisans and thus did not distinguish nonagri cultural workers and capitalists. Turgot (1770/1898) made explicit the division of the sterile or "stipendiary" class into "capitalist undertakers and simple workmen" (p. 54). Both argued on Malthusian-type grounds that competition among workers limits agricultural and nonagricultural wages to subsistence levels; hence, "the two working or non-disposable classes" receive only "the recompense of their labour" (p. 15). Because, in the Physiocrats' material-flows perspective, "there is no reve nue save the net produce of lands," the amount of wealth the cultivator "causes the land to produce beyond his personal wants" is the only fund for the wages which [nonagricultural workers] receive in exchange for their labour. The latter, in making use of the price of this exchange to buy in their turn the products of the Husbandman, only return to him exactly what they have received from him. (pp. 7-8,96) Similarly, all nonagricultural profit "is either paid by the revenue, or forms part of the expenditure which serves to produce the revenue" (p. 96). Although treating the cultivators as the only productive (surplus-producing) class, the Physiocrats did not consider the other classes to be completely useless consumers. For one thing, the fact that the proprietors can live off the net product means they "can be employed for the general needs of the society, such as war and the administration of justice" (Turgot, 1770/1898, p. 14). Alternatively, the propri etors can "turn over to the state a part of their revenue (i.e., net product) for the employment of men to provide these general needs" (Spengler, 1945a, p. 201 ). The social functionality of this arrangement matched the personal circumstances of the Physiocratic school, many of whom were landowners and government officials. Moreover, the Physiocrats were well aware that the working up of the "products of the land" into useful goods and services requires "preparations long and difficult" (Turgot, 1770/1898, p. 5). Accordingly, they viewed the sterile class as a "useful and necessary" cog in the total process of wealth production—this being what justi fied its receipt of "a money value sufficient to provide it with food, shelter, etc and [in the case of nonagricultural proprietors] a return on its advances" (Spengler, 1945a, p. 200; cf. Herlitz, 1961, pp. 12,39). The monetary expenditures of the ster</page><page sequence="9">Burkett / VALUE IN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS 145 ile class (hence the production and sale of nonagricultural products) were also essential to the realization (through market sales) of the agricultural net product. Given that agriculture alone yields a "disposable surplus over necessary costs," the Physiocrats' main policy proposals were geared toward increasing the size of the agricultural net product (Meek, 1963, p. 20). Reduced agricultural export taxes would increase the net product through price rises for agricultural goods (Banzhaf, 2000, pp. 518-519; Ware, 1931, p. 607). Similarly, consolidation of the plethora of agricultural taxes into a single moderate tax on land's net product would enhance "simplicity, justice, and economy" (because all taxes must in any case "eventually be paid out of this fund") while raising the level and the certainty of agricultural investment returns (Higgs, 1897/1952, p. 44). Finally, laissez-faire, laisser-aller policies, especially "full freedom of competition" and an end to mercantilist protec tion of inefficient nonagricultural enterprises, would establish "a kind of equilib rium" between agricultural and nonagricultural activities (Quesnay, 1767/1963c, p. 237; Turgot, 1770/1898, p. 83). This equilibrium would encourage stable growth of agricultural investment without unduly inhibiting the sterile class expenditures and nonagricultural activity needed to realize and process the net product (Meek, 1963, p. 396; Quesnay, 1766/1963b, p. 223). The Tableau Économique set out the circula tory conditions of such an ideal equilibrium for the case of simple reproduction (Meek, 1963, pp. 265-296; Quesnay, 1766/1963a).12 The Physiocrats and the Nature Valuation Debate Physiocracy represents an interesting hybrid of the different views held by present-day ecological economists on nature's value. Like the Physiocrats, the (energy, eco-Sraffian, and eco-Marxist) natural value theorists see nature as a direct source of economic value. The Physiocratic argument, that the land's surplus producing capability is the prime mover of wealth production, is echoed by both the energy value theory and the Georgescu-Roegen/Daly "enjoyment of life" approach, which find an ultimate net input in energy and "low-entropy matter energy," respectively. However, because Georgescu-Roegen and Daly do not share the energy theory's identification of value with the primary net input, they would not endorse the Physiocratic argument that agriculture is the sole source of a net value product. Nonetheless, both Georgescu-Roegen and Daly as well as the Physiocrats see human activity as more than a separate physical input to wealth pro duction: In both visions, human labor and ingenuity are crucial to the unleashing of nature's material-energetic productivity and its conversion into useful goods and services. It is just that the Physiocrats do not identify economic value with "enjoy ment of life" but rather with material means of subsistence. In other words, they define value as the material basis and substance of human life, not as human life understood in immaterial, psychic terms. Marx's Critique of the Physiocrats Marx's (1963) main engagement with Physiocracy on the question of value is in chapter 2 of Theories of Surplus Value (pp. 44-68).13 What immediately strikes the reader of this chapter is that Marx's extremely high regard for the Physiocrats is not limited to his well-known praise of Quesnay's Tableau (Marx, 1877/1939, p. 275; 1963, pp. 343-344; 1867/1967, Vol. 2, pp. 359-360) but extends to basic features of their analytical approach.14 The "great and specific contribution of the Physio crats," in Marx's view, is "that they derive value and surplus-value not from circula</page><page sequence="10">146 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2003 tion but from production" (1963, p. 49).'5 For Marx, this "contrast to the Monetary and Mercantile system" (1963, p. 49) qualifies Physiocratic analysis as the first "attempt to analyze the nature of surplus-value in general" (Marx, 1867/1967, Vol. 3, p. 784). It also explains why "the system of the Physiocrats is the first sys tematic conception of capitalist production" (Vol. 2, p. 360). Marx (1963) was especially impressed with the Physiocrats' analysis of the various material components in which capital exists and into which it resolves itself in the course of the labour-process It was their great merit that they conceived these forms as physiological forms of society: as forms arising from the natural necessity of production itself, forms that are independent of any one's will or of politics, etc. (p. 44)'6 However, although praising the Physiocrats' focus on production's "material laws," Marx suggested they erred in conceiving "the material law of a definite historical social stage ... as an abstract law governing equally all forms of society" (p. 44). What does Marx mean by this? The problem is that the Physiocrats did not critically analyze capitalism's own form of wealth valuation, that is, did not consider "value" in historically specific, social-relational terms. As a result, they confused the natural substance of real wealth with capitalist "value." Marx (1963) thus pointed to the Physiocrats' "gen eral view of the nature of value, which to them is not a definite social mode of exis tence of human activity (labour) but consists of material things—land, nature, and the various modifications of these material things" (p. 46). This is a "confusion of value with material substance, or rather the equating of value with it," and it shapes "the whole outlook of the Physiocrats" (p. 60). In Marx's view, capitalism reduces economic value to a specific social substance: abstract (homogeneous, socially necessary) labor time. So, from Marx's standpoint, the Physiocrats' confusion of value with material wealth explains why "they have not yet reduced value... to its simple substance—the quantity of labour or labour-time" (p. 46). And this, in turn, explains why they "could not penetrate the mystery of surplus-value" (Marx, 1867/ 1967, Vol. l,p. 534). For Marx, the source of surplus value is the ability of workers' labor power to produce commodities containing more value than is represented by their wages. Such a surplus presumes, of course, that agricultural labor is productive enough to produce more means of subsistence than is required by agricultural workers them selves. Otherwise, there would be no surplus product in agriculture and no means of subsistence for nonagricultural workers, hence no (agricultural or nonagricultural) surplus value (Marx, 1963, p. 48). In this sense, surplus value has a natural basis. Unfortunately, the Physiocrats conflated this natural basis with the actual determi nation of surplus value under specifically capitalist production relations: So what they say is not: the labourer works more than the labour-time required for the reproduction of his labour-power; the value which he creates is therefore greater than the value of his labour-power; or the labour which he gives in return is greater than the quantity of labour which he receives in the form of wages. But what they say is: the amount of use-values which he consumes during the period of production is smaller than the amount of use-values which he creates, and so a sur plus of use-values is left over. Were he to work only for the time required to repro duce his own labour-power, there would be nothing left over. But the Physiocrats only stuck to the point that the productivity of the earth enables the labourer, in his day's labour, which is assumed to be a fixed quantity, to produce more than he</page><page sequence="11">Burkett / VALUE IN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS 147 needs to consume in order to continue to exist. The surplus-value appears there fore as a gift of nature, through whose co-operation a definite quantity of organic matter—plant seeds, a number of animals—enables labour to transform more inorganic matter into organic. (Marx, 1963, p. 51) It needs to be emphasized that Marx did not deny the natural basis of either the surplus product or surplus value. Although arguing that it is wrong to treat surplus value in ahistorical, asocial terms, as simply "a pure gift of nature," he nonetheless said the Physiocrats were led to do this partly because "it depends on the productiv ity of nature that the labourer is able to produce in his day's labour more than is nec essary for the reproduction of his labour-power, more than the amount of his wages" (Marx, 1963, p. 55).17 In fact, Marx went out of his way to excuse the Physiocrats for their confusion, given their focus on agricultural productivity that was shaped by their historical circumstances. For one thing, Physiocracy "consid ers agriculture in comparison with a still quite undeveloped state of manufacture" (Marx, 1973, p. 588). Besides, is it not the case that in agriculture, the soil itself with its chemical etc. action is already a machine which makes direct labour more productive, and hence gives a surplus earlier, because work is done here at an earlier stage with a machine, namely a natural one? (Marx, 1973, p. 588) Marx (1973) even pardoned the Physiocrats on the grounds that agriculture is the only "field where the natural force of the instrument of labour [i.e., the land] tangi bly permits the labourer to produce more value than he consumes" (p. 328): The difference between the value of labour-power and the value created by it... appears most palpably, most incontrovertibly, of all branches of production, in agriculture, the primary branch of production. The sum total of the means of sub sistence which the labourer consumes from one year to another, or the mass of material substance which he consumes, is smaller than the sum total of the means of subsistence he produces. In manufacture the workman is not generally seen directly producing either his means of subsistence or the surplus in excess of his means of subsistence. The process is mediated through purchase and sale, through the various acts of circulation, and the analysis of value in general is necessary for it to be understood. In agriculture it shows itself directly in the surplus of use-values produced over use-values consumed by the labourer, and can therefore be grasped without an analysis of value in general, without a clear understanding of the nature of value. Therefore also when value is reduced to use-value, and the latter to mate rial substance in general. Hence for the Physiocrats agricultural labour is the only productive labour. (Marx, 1963, p. 46) For all these reasons, then, "agricultural labour... was bound to be considered the creator of surplus-value" by the Physiocrats (Marx, 1963, p. 48). The downside is that the Physiocrats' limited historical-social vision prevented them from criti cally analyzing capitalism's specific forms of wealth valuation and exploitation, that is, that "they let the form drop altogether and only look[ed] at the simple pro duction process" (Marx, 1973, p. 328). As a result, they "conceived value merely as use-value, merely as material substance, and surplus-value as a mere gift of nature" (Marx, 1963, p. 52): Their error was that they confused the increase of material substance, which because of the natural processes of vegetation and generation distinguishes</page><page sequence="12">148 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2003 agriculture and stock-raising from manufacture, with the increase of exchange value. Use-value was their starting point. And the use-value of all commodities, reduced, as the scholastics say, to a universal, was the material substance of nature as such, whose increase in the same form occurs only in agriculture.... Surplus value itself is wrongly conceived, because they have a wrong idea of value and reduce it to the use-value of labour, not to labour-time, social, homogenous labour. (Marx, 1963, pp. 62-63, 154) Given the close connection between the rise of capitalism and the Industrial Revolution, it seems paradoxical that the Physiocrats, with their emphasis on agri culture, conflated capitalist value with material wealth or use value. In Marx's ( 1963) view, this paradox reflects Physiocracy's historical context: that of "the new capitalist society prevailing within the framework of feudal society ... bourgeois society in the epoch when [it] breaks its way out of the feudal order" (p. 50). Hence, the Physiocrats "made of the capitalist form of production an eternal, natural form of production" but in "the character of a bourgeois reproduction of the feudal sys tem, of the dominion of landed property" (pp. 44, 49-50).18 This "feudal semblance" of the Physiocratic system helps explain some of its limitations and contradictions, especially its treatment of "the industrial spheres in which capital first develops independently... as 'unproductive' branches of labour, mere appendages of agriculture" and, thus, its failure to see nonagricultural produc tion as a source of surplus value (Marx, 1963, p. 50). For the Physiocrats, "rent is the only form of surplus-value" and "profit on capital in the true sense . . . does not exist" (Marx, 1963, pp. 46-47). Stated differently, the Physiocrats see rent as "the general form of surplus-value," whereas "industrial profit and interest are merely different categories into which rent is divided" (Marx, 1963, p. 47).19 In short, in Physiocracy "surplus-value is not explained as originating from capital as such, but is attributed to one particular sphere of the production of capital, agriculture" (Marx, 1867/1967, Vol. 2, p. 219). It is "explained ... in a feudal way, as derived from nature and not from society; from man's relation to the soil, not from his social relations" (Marx, 1963, p. 52). Nonetheless, Marx (1963) said, Physiocracy "is in fact the first system which analyses capitalist production, and presents the conditions within which capital is produced, as eternal natural laws of produc tion" (p. 49). As noted earlier, the Physiocrats' three-class schema assumes capitalist relations within agriculture, or as Marx (1963) put it, "it is taken for granted that the land owner confronts the labourer as a capitalist" (p. 51). In Marx's view, this presump tion is what enabled at least one of the Physiocrats, namely Turgot, to attain "a cor rect grasp of surplus-value... within the limits of agricultural labour.insofar as he treated the net product "as a product of the wage-labourer's labour" that the land owner appropriates "without an equivalent" (p. 57). That the Physiocrats' "land owner is in essence a capitalist" who "confronts the free labourer as an owner of commodities" also "hits the mark" insofar as the first condition for the development of capital is the separation of landed property from labour—the emergence of land, the primary condition of labour, as an inde pendent force, a force in the hands of a separate class, confronting the free labourer, (pp. 50-51 ) Because they took capitalist production relations as natural givens (at least within agriculture), however, the Physiocrats failed to analyze the connections</page><page sequence="13">Burkett / VALUE IN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS 149 between these relations and capitalism's specific forms of wealth valuation. In fact, they showed little if any interest in qualitative value-form issues. Hence, in their system, "value itself is resolved into mere use-value, and therefore into material substance," and "what interests [the Physiocrats] in this material substance" is not its social form but rather "its quantity—the excess of the use-values produced over those consumed... the purely quantitative relation of the use-values to each other, their mere exchange-value" (Marx, 1963, p. 52). The quantitative emphasis of the Physiocrats' value theory is shown by their treatment of money as merely a conve nient medium of exchange and measure of value, rather than in terms of what the necessity of such a general representative of value tells us about the underlying rela tions of production and vice versa (Quesnay, 1766/1963b, pp. 217-219). Stated dif ferently, the Physiocrats treat exchange value and money as natural forms of wealth or use value, not as (potentially contradictory) forms of capitalist wealth valua tion.20 Hence, they support "unhampered free competition, the removal from indus try of all interference by the State, monopolies, etc.," along with a single tax on agri culture, to ensure that the circulation and productive transformation of the agricul tural net product "should proceed without interruptions and in the cheapest way" (Marx, 1963, p. 53). Marx's Critical Appropriation of Physiocratic Ideas What distinguishes Marx from the Physiocrats is his definition of "value" as capitalism's specific form of economic valuation. Unlike the Physiocrats, who locate the source and substance of economic value in the material productivity of nature and agricultural labor in general, Marx insisted that capitalist value be ana lyzed in terms of this system's specific relations of production. In Marx's view, cap italism reduces value to the homogeneous, socially necessary labor time objectified in commodities. Marx saw this reduction as an outgrowth of the social separation of the laborers from the land and other necessary conditions of production, on which basis social production becomes mainly organized through market relations among competing enterprises employing wage labor for a profit. In other words, the reduc tion of value to labor time does not represent Marx's judgment as to which material production input is most important or "primary" (either logically or chronologi cally). Marx always insisted that as far as real wealth or use value is concerned, nature and labor are of coequal importance (Burkett, 1999, p. 26). That Marx found the substance of value in abstract labor is, in short, the result of his analysis of spe cifically capitalist production (Saad-Filho, 2002, chap. 3). It follows that the reduction of value to labor time does not apply to noncapitalist forms of production in Marx's view. Just as obvious, Marx did not see abstract labor time as an adequate representative or measure of wealth—including the wealth of nature. Indeed, the contradiction between use value (including its natural basis and substance) and value runs like a red thread throughout Marx's ( 1867/1967) analysis in Capital (Burkett, 1999, chap. 7). Hence, even though he showed that value must be represented in a general equivalent, money, and even though he noted that value and surplus value must be objectified in vendible use values, Marx made no pre sumption that the monetary exchange values of commodities accurately reflect wealth in all its natural and social diversity—either qualitatively or quantitatively (Rosdolsky, 1977, chap. 4 and 5). In fact, even the specific usefulness of natural conditions for capital is not, in Marx's view, either qualitatively or quantitatively captured by monetary exchange values insofar as they are determined by commod ity values—a contradiction manifested in the payment of rents (redistributions of</page><page sequence="14">150 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2003 surplus value) to the owners of monopolizable natural conditions of production. Nor does Marx's analysis presume that rents adequately reflect the use value of nature for capital let alone use value in the broader sense of nature's real contribu tion to human reproduction and development (Burkett, 1999, pp. 90-98; in press). Marx's historical and social-relational approach to value diverges sharply from the Physiocrats' crude materialist (and therefore idealist) approach. Yet Marx's materialism enabled him to critically incorporate certain Physiocratic concepts into his own analysis of capitalism. The Physiocratic elements in Marx's thinking stem from his understanding of capital's material requirements: exploitable labor power and the objectification of workers' labor in vendible use values (commodities) (Burkett, 1999, chap. 5). Insofar as nature supplies these requirements, it contrib utes to the accumulation of capital. As Marx (1867/1967) said, The amount of labour which a capital can command does not depend on its value, but on the mass of raw and auxiliary materials, machinery and elements of fixed capital and necessities of life, all of which it comprises, whatever their value may be. (Vol. 3, p. 248) Even though the substance of capitalist value is abstract labor time, the material world must provide capital with "material substance," and these "material elements of capital" must "serve to absorb additional labour, hence also additional surplus labour, and therefore create additional capital" (p. 248). Given capital's material requirements, Marx argued, "we may say that surplus value rests on a natural basis," namely, "on the naturally originating productivity of labour, which produces more than the absolutely necessary subsistence of the worker, a natural productivity which of course rests on qualities of its inorganic nature—qualities of the soil, etc." (Marx, 1867/1967, Vol. 1, p. 511 ; 1994, p. 155). Marx's endorsement of this kernel of truth in Physiocratic doctrine was discussed earlier—the point being that without an agricultural surplus, there can be no surplus labor in agriculture and no means of subsistence for nonagricultural workers, hence no surplus value in the economy as a whole. Marx's only complaint in this connec tion is that the Physiocrats reduced the socio-material determination of surplus value to this natural basis, due to their uncritical acceptance of capitalist production relations (at least in agriculture).21 Like the Physiocrats, Marx often referred to the natural conditions of production as "gifts" of nature. These gifts are freely appropriated by capital whenever they provide conditions enabling the extraction of surplus labor from workers and its objectification in vendible use values, without adding to the wage labor needed to produce commodities. Nature's gifts can serve as free gifts for capital; in other words, because even though they are not products of wage labor, they still provide use values that capital needs to produce and realize surplus value. Unlike the Physiocrats, Marx argued that such gifts "create use-value without contributing to the formation of exchange-value" (Marx, 1867/1967, Vol. 1, p. 204). He saw the free appropriation of nature's gifts as a key factor in capitalist development but in a way that recognizes the essential role of capitalist production relations. For Marx, capitalism's conversion of nature's gifts into conditions of surplus-value produc tion is enabled by the "freeing" of labor power from the land and other necessary conditions of production. The capitalization of nature's gifts is thus both condition and result of the system's alienation of real wealth vis-à-vis the natural and social requirements of sustainable human development, in Marx's view (Burkett, 1999, chap. 6).</page><page sequence="15">Burkett / VALUE IN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS 151 THE NATURE VALUATION DEBATE REVISITED Like the Physiocrats, ecological economists do not root the question of nature's value in capitalism's basic relations of production: "freeing" of labor power from the land and other necessary conditions of production and the reuniting of labor power and production conditions only as wage labor and capital producing com modities for a profit. In this sense, the nature valuation debate has not considered the monetary valuation of nature as a specifically capitalist form of valuation. As with the Physiocrats, this lack of attention to the connections between the system's internal economic relations and the way the system values nature leads to an identi fication of nature's value with its use value, an acceptance of exchange value and money as natural ways of valuing nature, and a one-sided quantitative perspective on nature's value. The way these tendencies work themselves out is a function of the somewhat different conceptions of use value and exchange value held by the respective participants in the debate. Energy Value Theory For the energy theorists, embodied energy—the true primary input or resource—best explains the relative and total production costs of commodities. Assuming that prices reflect production costs, they see embodied energy as the real source and substance of economic value as measured by money. The problem is that market valuations are assumed to be qualitatively and quan titatively adequate measures of the true resource costs of production. Hence, in his attack on energy value theory, Daly (1981, pp. 168-169) pointed out that it implic itly assumes not only an absence of monopolistic "imperfections" in the markets for resources and produced commodities but also that markets exist for all sources and types of energy used in production, including the free solar energy that lights and heats the earth, without which production obviously could not occur. Given such implausible assumptions, the statistical correlations found between embodied energy and monetary values are most likely not "a true empirical finding" but rather an "imposed result of the analytical framework," specifically the presumption of "only one primary input, namely energy" (p. 167).22 Worse yet, due to its search for the quantitative Holy Grail of a single primary input, the energy approach presumes that all natural resources can be reduced to pure energetic terms. Combined with the presumption that "embodied energy values are . . . accurate indicators of market values, and vice versa," this suggests that "market energy prices might be used to evaluate natural ecosystem structures and processes according to the amounts of energy embodied in them" (p. 168). Costanza's (1981b) response to Daly's critique verifies the energy theory's reductionism as well as its uncritical approach to the market. On the reduction of nature's use value as a production input to energy, he merely restated two of the the ory's assumptions in more "material" and "entropie" terms: (a) "Embodied energy is the direct and indirect energy required (in combination with unstructured mass) to produce organized material structures," and (b) "the energy embodied in material structures is taken as a measure of their degree of organization—the amount of low entropy they contain" (p. 188). If these two points clarify anything at all, it is that the energy theory's search for a primary input is driven by its reduction of the question of value to that of finding some common measure of use value conceived apart from historically specific social relations of production. This decision having been</page><page sequence="16">152 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2003 made, it is but a short step to the view that money and markets are just convenient social devices for registering these quantitative "energy values" as exchange values. Indeed, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the concern of energy theorists with value quantification is largely driven by their admiration for money and mone tary prices as unidimensional measures of use value. Hannon (1973), for example, made the case for an "energy standard of value" by analogy with the "readily under stood ... utility of employing a common denominator, such as money," to "measure value" (p. 139). Evidently, "evaluative standards other than money ought to be adopted... to add another dimension to the traditional money standard of value" (p. 139). Nonetheless, this additional dimension is still purely quantitative (British thermal units) and itself evaluated in monetary terms; hence, Hannon made refer ence to "the dollar cost of... alternatives to various goods or services which use less energy" (p. 140).23 For this kind of natural value theory, the inadequacies of the market reduce to quantitative deviations of monetary exchange values from energy values. More over, these deviations do not call for an abandonment of the market in favor of other (say, political) forms of economic decision making but rather a more complete and perfect marketization of nature: An embodied energy theory of value postulates that a perfectly functioning market would, through a complex evolutionary selection process, arrive at prices propor tional to embodied energy intensity. The transactions covered by the national input-output tables are carried on in relatively well-behaved (though not perfect) markets, and the theory predicts a good (though not perfect) empirical relation between market prices and embodied energy intensities for these sectors. This is a positive statement about how the existing market works. Given that this statement is relatively accurate, we can make a normative statement about what market (shadow) prices would be in the absence of all imperfections. Daly's criticism that an embodied energy theory of value implies the impossibility of divergence between market prices and embodied energy intensities is not accurate. To the con trary, I see large bodies of transactions (i.e., in ecological systems) where markets are nonexistent or incomplete. In these systems embodied energy obviously diverges from market price. It is just these points of divergence that are most inter esting, since embodied energy may be useful in correcting for imperfect owner ship and other market imperfections. (Costanza, 1981b, pp. 189-190) For Costanza, the problem of environmental damage from market-oriented pro duction is not due to any fundamental tensions between natural wealth and market valuation but rather to the fact that markets for natural wealth are missing, incom plete, or imperfect. Apparently, if nature's use value were properly reduced to embodied energy and then properly measured by money, environmental problems would be automatically corrected. In short, as Daly (1981) noted, the "surprising and disturbing implication of the energy theory of value... is its extension of mar ket prices to the valuation of ecosystem services heretofore considered outside the domain of the market" (p. 167). Indeed, Hannon (1973) applied monetary catego ries directly to quantities of energy itself, referring to the future "flow" of a new "currency ... regulated by the amount of energy budgeted for a given period" (p. 153). More recently, in an attempt to answer the question, "How might nature value man?" Hannon ( 1998) analyzed the "net outputs" of nonhuman ecological systems (reduced to pure energetic terms) using the categories of market values, prices, and rates of profit (pp. 273-277).</page><page sequence="17">Burkett / VALUE IN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS 153 The energy theorists' uncritical stance on the marketization of nature is also reflected in their otherwise inexplicable appeal to neoclassical utility theory with its correspondence between market prices and individual-subjective valuations of nature. Costanza ( 1981 a) thus claimed that "there is no inherent conflict between an embodied energy (or energy cost) theory of value and value theories based on util ity" (p. 140). Evidently, utility itself is ultimately reducible to energy flows (or is it vice versa?); otherwise, the appeal to "economic principles grounded in optimiza tion" to show the consistency of the cost-based and utility-based approaches makes no sense (p. 140). This may explain why Farberet al. (2002), after championing the energy value theory, were able to endorse various efforts at constructing artificial monetary valuations of natural resources, including some based on subjective valu ations by individual interviewees, in cases where relevant markets do not exist. Given the energy school's profoundly asocial approach to the question of value, it is not surprising that its leading member, Costanza (1989), based the case for a specifically ecological economics on technological pessimism, that is, a skeptical attitude toward the ability of new technologies to overcome predetermined natural (especially entropie) limits to economic growth (p. 4). Despite his references to methodological pluralism, Costanza's ecological economics does not encompass any inner connections between capitalist relations of production, nature valuation, and the tendency of production to deplete and despoil its natural conditions. The Eco-Sraffian Approach Like the energy school, the eco-Sraffian approach tends to naturalize capital ism's purely quantitative, monetary, and market-based valuation of nature and to blame environmental problems on the fact that markets in natural resources are either missing or incomplete. The basic problem is that Sraffian input-output mod els cannot distinguish the exploitation of labor from the exploitation of any other input. Treating production as a combination of discrete factors of production con nected by given technological parameters, they do not capture capitalism's specific relation of exploitation: wage labor. Hence, these models cannot be used to con struct a critical perspective on capitalism's specific form of nature valuation. Perrings (1987), for example, told us that the goal of his dynamic input-output analysis is "to establish just what the price mechanism can be expected to do in an economy-environment system and what it cannot" (p. xii). But rather than specify ing the specific production relations underpinning (more or less) generalized mar ket relations, he claimed that "coercive systems of production such as the slave, feu dal, or corvee systems are directly analogous to the more familiar exploitation of non-human environments" (p. xii). As a result, he found capitalism's "fundamental flaws" not in the system's production relations but rather in "environmental exter nal effects" (p. 1 ). The problem, evidently, is that not all "resources... are subject to rights and property"; hence, some natural resources "have the status of commodi ties and some... do not" (pp. 10-11 ). In short, "environmental resources... lie out side the price system of the economy," the result being "persistent external effects" (p. 11 ). Presumably if all natural resources could somehow be marketized and mon etized, the problem of "unobservability and uncontrollability of the processes of the environment through the price system" could be resolved (p. 11). Not surprisingly, Perrings supported the proposal of the neoclassical economist, Robert Solow, to use "environmental bonds" as a method of attaining "social control of external effects" (p. 164; see also Perrings, 1989; Solow, 1971 ). Such bonds are equivalent to a natu</page><page sequence="18">154 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2003 ral resource user fee paid by their purchasers, with the fee to be set according to the monetary value of the social ("external") costs associated with the use of the resource in question. This instrument presumes, of course, that money is an ade quate measure of natural wealth, despite all the uncertainties, qualitatively varie gated benefits and costs, and human value conflicts associated with natural resource use.24 Similarly, Gowdy (1988) first presented an input-output "growth accounting framework" that "would show the contribution to economic growth ... of labor, resources, and environmental services" (p. 38). He then endorsed various efforts at empirically quantifying these kinds of models in monetary terms and even applauded attempts "to adjust GDP for environmental damage" (p. 39). His response to those who would criticize the monetary valuation of natural wealth? "A wise person once said if anything is worth doing it is worth doing badly. Those con cerned with the accelerating loss of global environmental quality need to begin quantifying past economic growth and productivity considering these losses" (p. 39). But this response presumes that the monetary quantification of natural wealth is "worth doing," that is, that it does not carry value judgments, such as "more is better" and the substitutability of man-made and natural wealth, which contradict the ontological stance of Gowdy and other ecological economists.25 To be clear, the intent of the present critique is not to argue against the use of input-output methods to represent biophysical and energetic production data, as a way of posing analytical questions about the environmental problems faced by "the social institutions and signalling system of the economy" (Perrings, 1987, p. 7; cf. O'Connor, 1993a; Rees, 1999). The difficulties arise when input-output systems are overlaid with monetary exchange values that are taken as qualitatively adequate ways of representing natural "values" (really use values). Surprisingly, this kind of approach has been used even by some ecological economists who elsewhere insist on the incommensurability of natural use values. Martin O'Connor and Juan Martinez-Alier, for example, have strongly criti cized the monetization and capitalization of nature, that is, its reduction to quantita tive exchange values and "rates of return" (Martinez-Alier, Munda, &amp; O'Neill, 1998; O'Connor, 1994). Yet they have also used Sraffian input-output models to analyze questions of environmental sustainability and ecological conflicts. In one contribution, they identified value with exchange value (relative price) and argued that even though "environmental costs cannot, in general, be convincingly trans lated into prices," Sraffian pricing models can still provide "insights... concerning valuation of natural capital stocks and flows" (Martinez-Alier &amp; O'Connor, 1996, pp. 161 -162). Their "Sraffian ecological economics" represents "social conflicts of interests concerning the appropriation and use of natural capital" in "an industrial commodity economy" (Martinez-Alier &amp; O'Connor, 1996, p. 163). Even though the economy's production relations are not clearly specified, the model presumes generalized commodity production and monetary commensurability of natural use values. Indeed, it applies the categories of money prices and profits even to noncommodity processes such as "insertion of economic waste ... by economic proprietors into the environment [which] brings degradation of some ecological capital" as well as the production of "ecological capital" itself (Martinez-Alier &amp; O'Connor, 1996, p. 164).26 Given these presumptions, "ecological value system conflicts" are "portrayed at two levels. The first is the definition of... the prevailing price system; and the sec ond is contest over the distribution of any surplus-value defined in terms of this</page><page sequence="19">Burkett / VALUE IN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS 155 price system" (Martinez-Alier &amp; O'Connor, 1996, p. 166). All conflict outcomes are thus reduced to pure monetary quantities taken as accurate measures of ecologi cal "values," where value is identified with use value. Obviously, the influence of the model's presumptions goes well beyond the merely "didactic" (Martinez-Alier &amp; O'Connor, 1996, p. 153). Precisely because the Sraffian framework "does not deal with wider social/cultural issues such as political arrangements and incommensurability of values and systems of legitimacy" (Martinez-Alier &amp; O'Connor, 1996, p. 163), it is bound to shape one's basic visions of environmental sustainability and ecological conflict. Hence, O'Connor and Martinez-Alier (1998) drew a positive analogy between their Sraffian approach and the "general equilib rium methodology" that finds the roots of the environmental "externality problem" in "missing markets" for natural resources and resultant "cost-shifting" by capital ist enterprises "onto local communities, onto 'the taxpayer,' and onto future genera tions" (p. 38). Although they hastened to add that "the creating of markets through defining [property] rights and subsequent 'capitalization' is not necessarily a step towards social justice and sustainability" (p. 38), the logic of their own analysis runs against this qualification. Having severed any possible connection between the system's core production relations and its valuation of nature, it is not surprising that when not blaming envi ronmental problems on missing markets, the eco-Sraffians appeal to more or less free-floating ideological, institutional, and technological factors. Hence, Gowdy (1984) referred to the "preoccupation of modern economies with economic growth" as "a prime example of the extractive mentality" that, together with "cer tain 'ceremonial' activities promoted by the dominant class [which] are environ mentally wasteful," has caused civilization to run up against natural limits (p. 397). Others blame an "industrialist" ideology that is evidently not specific to capitalism because it also afflicted the Soviet Union and was, so the story goes, embraced by Marx and most subsequent Marxists (Martinez-Alier, 1995). That the social separa tion of workers and their communities from the land and other necessary conditions of production might have something to do with ecological problems seems to have escaped attention, and this may have something to do with the didactic use of mod els that do not specify the system's class relations. The Eco-Marxist Nature Exploitation View It may seem paradoxical that in arguing that capitalist production extracts value not just from labor power but directly from nature, eco-Marxism implicitly takes an uncritical stance on capitalist valuation. The problem, however, is that this approach does not mediate capital's appropriation of natural conditions through the system's social separation of workers from these conditions and the alienated form of their unification as wage labor and capital. As a result, the eco-Marxist attempt to attribute value directly to nature runs into contradictions when it tries to explain the forms in which nature's value appears once it has been extracted. According to Skirbekk (1994), nature is exploited whenever "a part of the natu ral resources is used without being restored, without an equal quantity of wealth being returned to nature," and "this destructive extraction of limited natural wealth represents an impoverishment of future generations" (p. 99). Notice that, in using the term exploitation to connote both the net extraction of natural wealth and the resulting impoverishment of future generations, this approach identifies value with use value. One does not need a value theory to say that capitalism (or any other form</page><page sequence="20">] 56 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2003 of production) appropriates natural wealth. But then we have learned nothing about how capitalism's specific forms of nature use and nature valuation differ from other historical forms (Burkett, 1999, pp. 101-102).27 This difficulty became evident when Skirbekk (1994) tried to show how the exploitation of nature creates higher monetary incomes. On one hand, he suggested that capitalists and/or workers in extractive industries (oil, for example) benefit from the sale of natural resources at prices exceeding their labor values and that this represents an important source of "extractive surplus profits." On the other hand, he argued that resource-using industries benefit from the underpricing of natural resources and consequent lowering of their unit production costs relative to their output prices (pp. 99-101). Apparently, extractive surplus profits involve a simulta neous overpricing and underpricing of natural resources compared to their labor values—but Skirbekk did not explain why the two forms of unequal exchange do not cancel each other out in the aggregate. Stated differently, the nature exploitation approach conflates value and exchange value (Burkett, 1999, pp. 102-103). In Marx's (1867/1967, Vol. 3, Pt. 6) view, for example, individual exchange values can incorporate surplus profits from the appropriation of scarce natural conditions. However, such surplus profits repre sent redistributions of surplus value in the form of rents and are not to be confused with the production of new surplus value (Burkett, 1999, pp. 90-93). More fundamentally, the whole conception of exploitation in terms of the under pricing and overpricing of natural resources presupposes that market prices and money can be qualitatively adequate representatives of nature's use value. Presum ably if prices were "properly" set, there would be no exploitation of nature. (But this of course would contradict the identification of "exploitation" with the extraction of natural wealth [use value].) Similar to the energy theorists and the eco-Sraffians, this conception bypasses the ecological contradictions of market prices and money as forms of natural wealth. As a result, the nature exploitation approach reduces capital's destructive use of nature to quantitative "extractive" terms, which tends to obfuscate the system's various qualitative forms of ecological despoliation. Entropy and Enjoyment of Life Georgescu-Roegen and Daly saw the productive use of low-entropy matter energy as the basis for value understood as psychic income or "enjoyment of life." On this basis, they rejected "cost of production" approaches that ascribe value directly to nature. Despite this divergence, however, the Georgescu-Roegen/Daly approach also fails to connect the issue of nature valuation to capitalism's relations of production, and this is reflected in an inadequately critical stance on market valu ation. In this case, the naturalization of market relations takes the form of an arbi trary dichotomy between allocation and scale. To begin seeing this, consider that the Georgescu-Roegen/Daly critique of cost-based value theories can be rephrased in simple supply and demand terms, as a failure to take demand-side factors into account. As Daly (1992b) said in reference to a hypothetical low-entropy theory of value: Although low entropy is a necessary condition for something to have any value at all, it is not a sufficient explanation of the value of one commodity relative to another. For one thing, entropy is entirely on the supply or cost side. There is still demand to consider. Hemlock may have lower entropy than orange juice.</page><page sequence="21">Burkett / VALUE IN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS 157 Bathwater heated to 211 °F has lower entropy than 110°F bathwater but is not more valuable, (p. 25) This criticism takes it for granted that the purpose of value theory is to explain relative prices and that supply and demand analysis is the appropriate way to attain such an explanation. Apparently, market values are, or can be made to be, adequate indicators of value in the sense of enjoyment of life and the costs of obtaining this enjoyment. This implication becomes especially disturbing when one considers how far removed the Georgescu-Roegen/Daly notion of enjoyment of life is from neoclassicism's "psychological categories of pure preference and choice" (Daly, 1981, p. 171). Daly's (1992b) "value" in particular sees the immaterial enjoyment of life as rooted in "the objective needs of human beings or other species considered as biological entities bound together in ecological communities and social sys tems" (p. 213). Georgescu-Roegen (1954) drew a similar contrast between human wants and abstract utility (or revealed preference) and used it to argue that wants are incommensurable, satiable, and "hierarchized." According to Daly, this hierarchy can be divided into "relative and absolute wants or needs" (p. 40), with the former involving subjective comparisons of one's situation with others and the latter not involving such comparisons. We will return to the use made of the relative-absolute wants distinction in a moment. The thing to emphasize here is that even though Georgescu-Roegen and Daly criticized abstract utility theory in the strongest terms, pointing out the neces sary ecological and cultural bases of enjoyment of life, they still did not question the neoclassical principle that use value can be adequately represented and measured by money and market prices. This uncritical acceptance of market valuation mani fests the shared failure of both neoclassicism and Georgescu-Roegen/Daly to relate the marketization of wealth to the system's core production relations. Paradoxically, that Daly (1992b) saw the market as merely a convenient device for allocating resources is most clear from his environmental critique of the market. Opposing neoclassical theory, he argued that it is only relative wants that are insa tiable and that this is fortunate given the "absolute scarcity" of the "ultimate means" of satisfying human wants, namely, low-entropy matter and energy (p. 39). Unfor tunately, markets are concerned only with "relative scarcity," that is, "the scarcity of a particular resource compared to another resource" (p. 39). The problem with the market system, in other words, is not that it allocates resources inefficiently or in antiecological fashion but rather that it does not take absolute scarcity—the prob lem of scale—into account. Because "scale is not determined by prices," it calls for "a social decision reflecting ecological limits" (Daly, 1992a, p. 188). The market "solves the allocation problem by providing the necessary information and incen tive. It does that one thing very well. What it does not do is solve the problem of optimal scale" (Daly, 1991, p. 35). Underpinning this allocation-scale dichotomy is the view that market exchanges are merely convenient arrangements among private individuals, that is, that market allocation is more private and less social than the question of scale. This is asserted even though the relative wants catered to by the market involve intersubjective com parisons. As Daly (1992a) phrased it, "distribution and scale involve relation ships ... that are fundamentally social in nature rather than individual" (p. 190). He amplified the point in a piece coauthored with Costanza: The cost and benefit functions relevant to the micro-allocation problem are those of individuals bent on maximizing their own private utility both as consumers and</page><page sequence="22">158 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2003 producers. The market coordinates and balances these individualistic maximizing efforts and in so doing determines a set of relative prices that measure opportunity cost. Individuals are allowed to appropriate matter-energy from the ecosystem as required for their individualistic purposes. Since the benefits of such expropriation are mostly private while the costs are largely social, there is a tendency to overex pand the scale of the economy.... Therefore the macro-allocation or scale prob lem should be viewed as a social or collective decision rather than an individualis tic market decision. (Costanza &amp; Daly, 1992, p. 41) The allocation-scale, private-social dichotomy thus mimics the standard "exter nalities-missing markets" view of environmental problems. The only difference is that Daly (1992b) conceptualized the externalities at the macro level, as the econ omy's overuse of low-entropy matter-energy and overemission of high-entropy matter-energy. Like neoclassical theory, Daly treated the economy itself as a social relational black box, its internal structural relations having been reduced to private market transactions among free-floating individuals. Not surprisingly, Daly's pol icy prescriptions are quite similar to those of neoclassical environmental econom ics. He suggested that private markets be used to price and allocate natural resource "depletion quotas" as well as quotas on aggregate births (chap. 3). In other words, "quantitative limits are set with reference to ecological and ethical criteria, and the price system is then allowed, by auction and exchange, to allocate depletion quotas and birth quotas efficiently" (Daly, 1974, p. 20). Daly's admiration for market devices is also reflected in his support for monetary valuation of "natural capital" as well as for efforts to "adjust" standard measures of national and even world income for resource depletion and other environmental costs (Costanza &amp; Daly, 1992, pp. 41-43; Daly, 1991, p. 41; Daly &amp; Cobb, 1989, pp. 401-455). The crucial question haunting this entire approach, of course, is whether alloca tion and scale are really independent aspects of economic activity and economy nature interaction.28 Once one steps away from the vision of the economy as an aggregated processor of low-entropy matter-energy, it becomes clear that the set ting of depletion quotas on particular (animate and inanimate) forms of matter and energy (or any birth quota applied across households of varying wealth levels and socioecological circumstances) is by its nature an allocational decision. It can hardly be otherwise, given that environmental "externalities" are "an inherent and general part of the production and consumption process" in market economies (Ayres &amp; Kneese, 1969, p. 295). Moreover, the market allocation of said quotas, and resulting patterns of economic activity and sociomaterial reproduction, will naturally have various quantitative and qualitative impacts on natural and social wealth, that is, on human life in all its cultural and ecological diversity. In short, it is impossible to separate scale from allocation unless we take the market determina tion of the latter as a natural "given" and accordingly reduce all questions of scale to aggregate (i.e., global) low-entropy matter-energy use as measured by a single indi cator that can only be monetary.29 The allocation-scale dichotomy helps explain the failure of the Georgescu Roegen/Daly approach to come up with any meaningful explanation as to how humanity has gotten into the environmental straits it is currently in. Lacking a criti cal perspective relating the economy's production relations and allocational mech anisms, the tendency is to appeal to exogenous technological and ideological fac tors. Georgescu-Roegen's (1973) reduction of economic history to "entropie degradation of matter-energy" goes so far as to treat the discovery of fossil fuels as a kind of original sin enabling "the modern fever of industrial development" by</page><page sequence="23">Burkett / VALUE IN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS 159 which people became "addicted to industrial luxuries"—the problem being that "Man's nature is such that he is always interested in what will happen until tomor row, not in thousands of years from now" (pp. 54, 58). Daly (1974), on his part, blamed the "technological project of redesigning the world (substituting technosphere for ecosphere) so as to allow for indefinite eco nomic growth" and said the "conceptual roots of [this] growthmania are to be found in the orthodox doctrines of 'relative scarcity' and 'absolute wants' " (p. 17). Even though he criticized the "money fetishism," according to which neither the satisfac tion of desires nor the multiplication of interest income has any limit, Daly did not relate the dominant power of money in capitalist society to this system's production relations (the story of Midas is quite old after all). As a result, he did not ask whether his critique of money and interest applies equally to capital and profit in general (Daly, 1992b, pp. 45,186-187). In sum, we are counseled not to struggle against the system of market-oriented production for profit that is reeking environmental havoc (that would be too dangerous and impractical) but to attack "the ideology of growth" (Daly, 1974, p. 19). Evidently, the most promising line of attack is that pro vided by "traditional religions" that "teach man to conform his soul to reality by knowledge, self-discipline, and restraint on the multiplication of desires" (Daly, 1992b, p. 44; cf. Daly &amp; Cobb, 1989). CONCLUSION Although applauding the Physiocrats' materialist analysis of capitalist produc tion, and even appropriating some of their conceptions for his own purposes (espe cially the concept of nature's gifts and the natural basis of surplus value), Marx crit icized Physiocracy's identification of value with nature's material use value. In his view, this identification carries with it an unfortunate naturalization of capitalist forms of valuation (exchange value, money, and profit) and of the class relations that underpin them. This article has shown that the same basic critique applies to the contemporary nature valuation debate. Like the Physiocrats, the debate's partici pants have identified value with use value in one form or another and have not criti cally addressed the qualitative issues raised by the marketization and monetization of wealth in general and natural wealth in particular. And, as with the Physiocrats, this gap is arguably rooted in the failure of ecological economists to develop the inner connections between capitalist production relations and capitalist valuation. Because they do not distinguish nature's productive use value in general from the material requirements of capitalist production in particular, the participants in the debate are unable to distinguish sustainable development from sustainable capital ism. Indeed, they are unable to even specify the causes of environmental crises in specifically capitalist terms. As a result, they are unable to distinguish environmen tal crises of capitalist reproduction and capitalistically induced crises in the natural conditions of human development. In Marx's view, by contrast, the social form and material requirements of capi talist reproduction directly contradict the requirements of a healthy and sustainable human development. Marx therefore was able to clearly distinguish environmental crises of capital accumulation (e.g., due to raw materials shortages) from crises in the conditions of human development brought on by capital's exploitative appropri ation of natural conditions (Burkett, in press). The method Marx used to obtain these insights and the analytical mediations involved are too complex to fully recount here. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note the key role of Marx's dia lectical approach to nature, value, and use value.</page><page sequence="24">160 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2003 For Marx, as noted earlier, capitalism's reduction of value to labor time is based on this system's social separation of labor power from the land and other necessary conditions of production, and their recombination only under capital exploiting wage labor for a profit. In this sense, capitalism's fundamental form of valuation is rooted in what Foster (2000) has termed a "metabolic rift" between people and nature. Capitalist valuation also manifests the material, use value requirements of value and capital: exploitable labor power, conditions in which this exploitation can take place, and the necessity to objectify workers' labor in vendible commodities. After all, capitalism is a social form of human-material production; hence, it still has material, use value requirements.30 But these requirements are obviously quite minimal compared to the requirements of a healthy and sustainable interchange between economy and nature. In fact, capitalism can in principle continue to repro duce itself under any natural conditions, however degraded (and however high the entropy level), short of the complete extinction of human life. This is precisely why it is so crucial to analytically distinguish capitalist reproduction from human-natu ral reproduction in general. Marx insisted, moreover, that the regulation of social production by the market (the imperative for value to be objectified in saleable commodities) is itself based on the separation of producers from necessary production conditions.31 It is true that markets and money have existed for eons, but the dominant position of profit driven commodity production and the constant competitive pressures on the pro ducers owe themselves to the commodification of "free" labor power and its employment by autonomous enterprises controlling the (now "separate") condi tions of production. The conversion of natural conditions into mere conditions of market- and profit-driven production (either through their free appropriation or through their formal capitalization as rent-yielding private or state property) is, in particular, enabled by the "freeing" of labor power from these conditions. This pro cess continues today whenever public or communal lands are privatized, and when ever corporations are given freer reign to exploit national forests and other natural resources. Marx's analysis contains a powerful ecological indictment of capitalism's valu ation of natural wealth (Burkett, 1999, chap. 6-8). It highlights the contradiction between capitalism's reduction of value to abstract labor time and nature's contri bution to wealth production. (Marx has often been blamed for this contradiction, but the real culprit is capitalism.) It also emphasizes the tensions between value's monetary forms on one hand and the natural environment on the other. Money is homogeneous, divisible, mobile, and quantitatively unlimited, by contrast with the qualitative variegation, interconnection, locational uniqueness, and quantitative limits of natural and ecological wealth.32 Capitalist environmental crises—both cri ses in accumulation and crises in the conditions of human development—clearly manifest these tensions (Burkett, 1999, chap. 9). The power of Marx's analysis derives from its establishment of inner connec tions between market valuation of nature and capitalism's core class relation: wage labor. The qualitative and quantitative contradictions between monetary exchange values on one hand and the real wealth of nature and the conditions of its reproduc tion on the other are rooted in capitalism's alienation of the producers vis-à-vis the conditions of their existence. This perspective poses a challenge to workers and communities everywhere: that of converting capitalism's alienated social forms of nature valuation into explicitly communal forms appropriate to human beings codeveloping with their environments, including other species. Only through a real</page><page sequence="25">Burkett / VALUE IN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS 161 communality, in which people gain control over the social conditions of their exis tence (instead of placing them at the service of exploitative and anarchically com petitive money making), will society be able to regulate its metabolic interchange with nature in a healthy and sustainable way. This vision of a communal reunion of the producers and the conditions of production, based on a recognition of the histor ically specific, limited character of capitalism, makes Marx's perspective on nature valuation much more "open" than those approaches that close off both history and Utopia by accepting money, capital, and the market as permanent social forms of human and natural wealth.33 NOTES 1. For similar statements along these lines, see Hannon (1973, pp. 139-140), Costanza (1980, pp. 1219-1220; 1981a, p. 122), Gowdy (1991, pp. 80-81), Deléage (1994, p. 44), and Salleh ( 1997, p. 155). Mirowski (1988) provided a critical history of energy value theories. 2. To anticipate, this view of the nature and purposes of value analysis is most definitely not shared by Marx, however much it may have affected the classical economists including Ricardo. 3. See, for example, Perrings (1987), Gowdy (1988), O'Connor (1993b), Martinez Alier ( 1995), Martinez-Alier and O'Connor (1996), O'Connor and Martinez-Alier ( 1998). 4. This conclusion may seem harsh, but consider Costanza's (1981a) response to the observation that value analysis could do the same thing we have done with energy with any of the other currently defined primary factors. We could thus support capital, labor or government ser vice theories of value. The answer is that on paper we could. We must look to phys ical reality to determine which factors are net inputs and which are internal trans actions. Can any one seriously suggest that labor creates sunlight? (p. 140) Similarly, Hannon (1998), after paying lip service to the various "natural inputs to the econ omy, such as water, minerals, soil (erosion) and sunlight," constructed a price analysis pre suming "only one net input, absorbed sunlight," so that "metabolic factor costs" can be iden tified with "absorbed energy units ... per unit of product" (pp. 269, 273). 5. An alternative statement of the same argument may be made in terms of Sraffa's "standard commodity," that is, the "commodity, or set of commodities, that... if this were to be selected as money, or as numéraire, measurement [of exchange values] in terms of it would be invariant to distributional shifts" between wages and profits (Dobb, 1973, p. 263; cf. Sraffa, 1960, pp. 18-25). Basically, energy plays the same role in energy value theory as the standard commodity plays in Sraffa's model: that of an invariant measure of value (Judson, 1989, p. 268). Those ecological economists who use Sraffian models while reject ing energy value theory are thus arguing that the composition of the standard commodity cannot be plausibly expressed in pure energy terms, given the material (physical, chemical, and biological) differentiation of the production system. 6. Along the same lines, Stern (1999) argued that "a biophysical theory of value forma tion needs to account for the use of knowledge in the creation of economic value and should not limit itself to the role of energy alone" (p. 392). 7. "From the viewpoint of thermodynamics, matter-energy enters the economic process in a state of low entropy and comes out of it in a state of high entropy" (Georgescu-Roegen, 1973, p. 51). 8. "Value derives from the enjoyment of life, and there is more to life than energy For example, there is material, there is time, there is purpose, there is beauty. These things all affect value without bearing any determinate relation to energy (Daly, 1981, p. 168)."</page><page sequence="26">162 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2003 9. As detailed by Neill (1949, pp. 533-542), the Physiocrats felt that these natural eco nomic laws or truths, although more or less self-evident on discovery, still had to be logically deduced and verified by evidence. For this reason, many consider the Physiocrats "the first scientific school of political economy" (Higgs, 1897/1952, p. 3). 10. Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot (1727-1781) served as controller-general of France from 1774 to 1776. He was a strong advocate of bourgeois economic and political reforms, and Marx (1963) even described him as "one of the immediate fathers of the French revolu tion" (p. 344). Although the individualistic Turgot "refused to wear [the] intellectual badge" of the Physiocrats, "he shared many of their ideas" and was, in fact, a leading systematizer and popularizer of Physiocratic thought (Higgs, 1897/1952, p. 4). 11. Quesnay (1763/1963d) qualified this for the case of early peoples who "were able to consume the spontaneous gifts of nature without making any effort" (p. 60), although even here such consumption had to be preceded by the labor of hunting and gathering. 12. These notions of laissez-faire and equilibrium should not be identified with a com plete support for free market policies and unrestricted private property rights, however. There was, for example, no presumption in favor of free imports in the Physiocratic program (Ware, 1931, p. 607). Generally speaking, the Physiocrats supported activist state policies and even infringements on private property rights as necessary to establish and maintain a structure within which competition would increase the size of the net product through its improved allocation. For details on this point, see Samuels ( 1961,1962). On the contradic tions in Physiocratic policy analysis—for example, between the goal of economic and politi cal liberty and the endorsement of "a single sovereign authority" (Quesnay, 1767/1963c, p. 231)—see Spengler (1945b, p. 328). 13. Theories of Surplus Value, a massive critical history of political economy written in 1861 to 1863, was to have been the fourth volume of Capital, but this plan was not fulfilled. Among Marx's other major writings on the Physiocrats are the chapter he contributed to Engels's Anti-Diihring (Marx, 1877/1939), chapter 6 of Theories of Surplus Value (Marx, 1963, pp. 308-344), and chapter 19, section 1 of volume 2 of Capital (Marx, 1867/1967, pp. 359-362). But these texts all focus on the Tableau, not basic value-theoretic issues. A brief precursor of the discussion dealt with here appears in the Grundrisse (the first draft of Capi tal, compiled in the winter of 1857-1858) (Marx, 1973, pp. 328-330, 588). 14. Even Marxologists often do not mention any dimension of Marx's engagement with the Physiocrats other than his interest in the Tableau. See, for example, Meek (1973, p. xlii) and Rosdolsky (1977, pp. 457-458). 15. "The Physiocrats transferred the inquiry into the origin of surplus-value from the sphere of circulation into the sphere of direct production, and thereby laid the foundation for the analysis of capitalist production" (Marx, 1963, p. 45). 16. Marx (1963) thus credited the Physiocrats with the first serious analysis of the value of labor power in its material aspects (p. 45). He also applauded Quesnay's pioneering analy sis of the distinction between fixed capital and circulating capital (Marx, 1867/1967, Vol. 2, pp. 189, 198). 17. "The physiocrats, furthermore, are correct in stating that in fact all production of surplus-value ... has for its natural basis the productiveness of agricultural labour. If man were not capable of producing in one working-day more means of subsistence, which signi fies in the strictest sense more agricultural products than every labourer needs, for his own reproduction, if the daily expenditure of his entire labour-power sufficed merely to produce the means of subsistence indispensable for his own individual requirements, then one could not speak at all either of surplus-product or of surplus-value (Marx, 1867/1967, Vol. 3, pp. 785-786)." 18. This interpretation carries no presumption of deliberate stealth campaigning on the Physiocrats' part: "The label of a system differs from that of other articles, among other things, by the fact that it cheats not only the buyer but often also the seller. Quesnay himself and his immediate disciples believed in theirfeudal shop-sign (Marx, 1867/1967, Vol. 2, p. 360)." 19. Although the Physiocrats "are quite right in considering the creation of surplus-value as decisive," their "attempt to analyze the nature of surplus-value in general" is "troubled by</page><page sequence="27">Burkett / VALUE IN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS 163 difficulties" insofar as "they consider rent-yielding, or agricultural, capital to be the only capital producing surplus-value, and the agricultural labour set in motion by it, the only labour producing surplus-value" (Marx, 1867/1967, Vol. 3, p. 784). Herlitz (1961) went so far as to suggest that the "deliberate over-valuation of the money-rent of land" is "a distinc tive feature of Quesnay's method" (p. 51). 20. Banzhaf (2000) was thus wrong to lump Marx in with those who fault the Physiocrats for failing to distinguish the material net product from the "value surplus," with "value" understood simply as "exchange value," that is, "market prices" (p. 520). When Marx criti cized the Physiocrats for conflating value and (material) use value, he was using the term value to connote the specific social substance that (in his view) regulates exchange values, namely, social labor time in the abstract. Marx (1877/1939) was well aware that the Physio crats used money as a measure of value and treated monetary exchange values. In fact, he castigated Eugen Dühring for his inability to understand this basic feature of Quesnay's Tab leau (pp. 267-268). Marx's problem with the Physiocrats is that they failed to reduce value to its specifically capitalist substance and were thus unable to deal with the difficult value-form issues posed by capitalist valuation and exploitation. 21. For details of Marx's many analyses of the natural basis of surplus value, see Burkett (1999,chap. 3). As Foster (2000, p. 167) pointed out, Marx applied his critique of the Physio crats to Malthus, who at certain points also treated surplus value as simply a gift of nature, thereby conflating the actual determination of surplus value with its natural basis. See Marx (1994, pp. 150-159). 22. This is most obviously the case in the input-output studies that first reduce production cost to embodied energy and then assume that prices reflect costs. But a similar spurious cor relation is at work in the more aggregative studies of energy-GDP or energy-GNP ratios that employ "adjustments for fuel quality" to strengthen the correlations between energy use and GDP or GNP. See Stern (1999) on this point. 23. Hannon's (1998) more recent derivation of "ecological prices" (really energy prices) also starts from a principles-level account of money, market exchange, and prices as conve nient social devices (p. 273). 24. This presumption is not softened one bit if the user fee is set at a level determined by "worst case" social costs (Perrings, 1987,p. 165; 1989,p. 101;Solow, 1971, p. 502). The dif ficulty lies in the qualitative reduction of natural wealth to homogeneous monetary terms. For a discussion of other limitations of environmental bonds connected with information problems, perverse incentives, and inequalities in economic power, see Shogren, Herriges, and Govindasamy (1993). 25. On the problems with "adjusting" GDP for environmental effects, see Norgaard (1989b), Aaheim and Nyborg (1995), Hueting (1996, p. 87), and Lintott (1996). 26. See also O'Connor (1993b), in which the categories of money, price, and profit rate are applied to "a 'traditional' society geared to self-reproduction" (p. 409). 27. The same shortcoming affects Brennan's (1997) argument that capitalist production extracts value from nature by not paying for nature's reproduction time. 28. For the debate on this point in the pages of Ecological Economics, see Prakash and Gupta (1994), Daly (1994, 1999), and Stewen (1998). 29. Responding to the point that allocation and scale cannot be separated, Daly (1994) warned that "theorists must not allow themselves to be debilitated and rendered irrelevant by too deep a philosophical reflection on the infinite interconnectedness of all things" (p. 91). Apparently some questions are too dangerous to ask, especially when they point to the inter nal class relations of the economy as the real root of environmental crises. 30. In Marx's analysis, this role of use value is imprinted in the definition of value itself as socially necessary labor time, with social necessity defined partly in terms of the demand for the commodity in question. This implies among other things that value and price are simulta neously determined in Marx's view. See Saad-Filho (2002, chap. 5-7). 31. Stated differently, the regulation of resource allocation by market prices and the cor responding role of money as a general representative and embodiment of wealth are neces</page><page sequence="28">164 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2003 sary forms of capitalist value understood as abstract labor time. For Marx's development of this connection, see Rosdolsky (1977, chap. 5) and Marx (1867/1967, Vol. 1, Pt. 1). 32. These antiecological features of money are noted by Sterrer (1993, p. 195), without, however, connecting the general use of money and monetary valuation to capitalism's spe cific production relations and specific value substance: abstract labor time. 33. See Proops (1989) on the advantages of historically "open" analysis for ecological economics as both theory and policy. REFERENCES Aaheim, A., &amp; Nyborg, K. (1995).
