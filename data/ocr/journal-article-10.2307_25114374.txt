(W. H. Auden, "The Shield of Achilles") Natahaniel Wallace is professor of English at South Carolina State University. His articles have appeared in Romanic Review and Comparative Literature, his reviews in Textual Practice, and Modern Painters. In "The Shield of Achilles"poet Auden wrily and morosely updates Homer's lambent depiction of a divine metal-worker's ren dering of a wondrous piece of armor (Kossman 2001, 230-31). Here staged are the foiled expectations of a modernized Thetis as, with anticipation, she inspects the agile craftsmanship of a present-day Hephaistos</page><page sequence="2">56 College Literature 35.4 [Fall 2008] absorbed in producing a substantial shield for a contemporary Achilles. As opposed to the high seriousness of the Trojan conflict, "a voice without a face" has simply "proved by statistics that some cause was just" ("The Shield of Achilles" //. 16-17). Instead of massive city walls, a twentieth-century Hephaistos settles for "barbed wire" enclosing "an arbitrary spot" (1. 31). A master of deflation and understatement, Auden has conjured up a cornucopia of political and other ironies.1 But perhaps what is most salient?what Thetis especially looks for and cannot locate amid this hapless sea of disappoint ments?are signifiers of community, of human existences constructively interlocked, whether expressed as "marble well-governed cities" (1. 3) or "men and women in a dance" (1. 47) or whatever is implied as the obverse of "a million eyes, a million boots in a line /Without expression" (11.14-15). Pushing off from Auden s astute rendering of collective malaise and anomie, this essay seeks to re-engage the notion of community through an assessment of two contrasting foundational sites?one Hebraic, the other Hellenic?that are concerned with cultural definitions. Across religious, geo graphic and other boundaries, shared and differentiating factors are sought out that relate to the (d) evolution of community. Conceptual grounding for this inquiry is located in the pioneering work ofVictor Turner, who argues for the notion of an ever-negotiable "communitas" that is "a spontaneously generated relationship between leveled and equal total and individuated human beings, stripped of structural attributes" (1974, 202). Much of Turner's thought is hinged on his perception that during "liminal periods of major rites de passage the 'passengers' and 'crew' are free, under ritual exigency, to contemplate for a while the mysteries that confront all men" (242). Also significant for this discussion is a contrasting perspective, demon strated in the work of cultural theorist Giorgio Agamben, who maintains the key relevance for communities of the aquodlibet" taken as any value or assumption understood as "being such that it always matters" (1993,1). Along with the quodlibet, Agamben emphasizes the notion of singularity, explained quite broadly as "whatever you want, that is lovable" and as someone or something desired "with all of its predicates, its being such as it is" (2). Clearly, the notion of social union as framed by Agamben?and derived from the contingencies and strictures of postmodern life?entails protocols much at variance with those ofTurner, who intensively researched the customs of tra ditional African tribal societies. While Turner's approach highlights the col lective elements and dimensions of cultural entities, Agamben envisions a community that is ever in process, is all-welcoming and tolerant. Here fore grounded or privileged is the consensual sharing of some vast existential arena wherein variant subjectivities are at home and thrive. More likely to flourish during the era of the internet and global tourism than in Homeric</page><page sequence="3">Nathaniel Wallace 57 Greece or the demesnes of Exodus, the highly individualized yet an-anarchic community conceived of by Agamben may nonetheless have antecedents in these textual contexts that are historically remote. In turn, these sites at his tory's threshold may become better understood with reference to the cultural nuances delineated by this theorist.2 With these discursive coordinates in mind, discussion turns to two well known texts often focused on because of their salient indicators of cultural idealization.These examples, however, also stage their respective social groups as mired in internal conflicts, ambiguities, flux, and attempts at definition and revision?and hence not quite divorced from the fractured illusions brought into focus by Auden. Inclusive or "global" in its outlook, Book 18 of the Wad (also known as the "Oplopoiia") is concerned with the forging of community (especially lines 478 608) .3 Central to the episode is Hephaistos' fashioning of a shield (sakos) that he ornaments with exquisite depictions of archaic Mediterranean life. The divine metal-worker is?at least in this episode?a culture-hero. His demonstrations of Hellenic mastery of a series of artistic and other competencies suggests that they are inherently Greek. Recruiting herdsmen and warriors, judges, dancers, and acrobats, this awesome shield becomes an ekphrastic theater filled with the impulses and aspirations of cooperating as well as antagonistic individuals and groups. Yet this highly descriptive passage is pervasively diegetic or narrative based as well. It is after all the telling of a process of advanced craftsmanship, or as James Heffernan puts it, Homer becomes temporarily absorbed in the process of "representing representation itself" (1993,22).4 And implied, while the shield is forged and decorated in an almost improvisatory manner, is an analogy with the composing of an oral text, a process now hinted at to be almost sponta neous. The textual and other constructivist values here embedded, during a pause in an agonizing and extended crisis, are imbricated with community val ues such as collective endurance, the ability of individuals and groups to ham mer out alliances, and the capacity of a people to remain receptive to opportu nities for celebration and other forms of pleasure. Along with numerous idealizations and illusory fulfillments, the Shield-of Achilles account is fraught with images of socio-cultural disintegration. In any case, the material herein that relates to a discourse (as well as a dialectic) of com munality is plenteous. Surely useful at this point is a survey if not a full census of the contributions of this Homeric text to a theory of community (as well as to the practice thereof) as Hephaistos constructs and ornaments the shield. Even before the shield and its effervescent images begin to take shape according to the aesthetic and pragmatic intentions of a celestial artisan, the poet of the Iliad advances a provocative detail with implications for unfold ing the conceptual matrix of a perfected community. At issue here are the</page><page sequence="4">58 College Literature 35.4 [Fall 2008] fanciful bellows that instantaneously obey their master's every command and blast air wherever needed to enliven the forger's fire and hence render mal leable (or even liquify) the varied metals required for the incipient shield.Yet the automata are not citizens or members of any kind of social group even if, like an idealized team of galley oarsman or squadron of ?lite soldiers, their ability to obey instantly and unswervingly can contribute to an intention driven plan, an agenda. While their distinguished responsiveness and ergonomie excellence are ostensibly valuable for a community, their short coming is that each automaton can only act independently, in response to the commands of Hephaistos, without the possibility of reflective coordination with other members of their robotic "squadron." Thus at the outset of the "Shield" passage, a cognitive gap is opened that leads to a titillating partial vision of the optimal community-minded subject. Here are penumbral "individuals" who are distinctively endowed with techne, are highly skilled at what they do, and they willingly heed authority. Yet they are never required to cooperate with others. The descent from the Olympian workplace into the purview of human subjectivity as revealed on the shield will implicate a poetics of mind quite apart from that of Hephaistos' attendants. At hand is the broad existential arena of wisdom or sophrosyne, of reflection, of affective states, interaction with others, judgment, and inevitably, error as well. The ekphrasis proper of the shield-in-process begins with a well-known double segment, a tale of two cities?one at peace, the other under siege. Concerned with wedding scenes, dancing, and a civilized attempt to settle a dispute resulting from a homicide, the city-at-peace is a social purview wherein a sense of community is alive and well. The maintenance and repair of harmonious relationships between citizens are of much significance in this urban setting. Yet if the city-at-peace, a seeming quasi-paradise of civility, is digested in tandem with (rather than in contrast to) the antagonized city-at war, a disturbing larger pattern emerges: a step-by-step deterioration from the promised ecstasy of the marriage processions into homicidal chaos. However well-contained and mediated the violence of a murder appears in the immediate context of the judging scene at the close of the city-at-peace segment, this archive of bloodshed can also be apprehended as a lead-in to the escalating violence of the ensuing siege episode.5 Thus, as the city-at-peace section closes with exposition of an unresolved conflict between two parties, so the diegesis of the city-under-siege begins with a parallel?yet much starker, more severe?verbal diagram of a conflict-in progress.The latter city is surrounded by two armed militias whose leaders are in overall agreement regarding their interest in conquering this center of pop ulation and communal enterprises. However, in addition (and rather like the contenders in the market place), one group of prospective assailants is divid</page><page sequence="5">Nathaniel Wallace 59 ed by debate?in this case whether to attack on its own or share evenly with the other group the various riches that the city might eventually yield.6 Despite the inauspicious array of givens, the townspeople elect to resist; they even initiate an ambush on the enemy's food supply. Events unfold rap idly as warriors from the city abruptly destroy the highly vulnerable pastoral world brought into play by the antagonists who have laid siege and have accumulated substantial numbers of sheep and other livestock as sustenance during a lengthy campaign. For the briefest of intervals, the poet evokes a pastoral sublime with mention of herdsmen playing obliviously on rustic instruments. The situation deteriorates quickly: the hapless syrinx-players are slain, and amid the ensuing tumult, the encircling belligerents abandon their debate over spoils to inflict a united assault on the city's forces. If there is a sense of community in the notion of armed combatants coordinating their individual efforts to achieve a common goal or goals, any glimmer of ideal ism vanishes as arrant mayhem prevails. The nadir of the entire ekphrasis is approached as Hephaistos depicts the pagan deities of annihilation (Eris, Kudoimos, and Ker) indiscriminately engaged in generating homicidal havoc. The troubling specter of an antinomian anti-community is here conjured up through the wondrous artisanry of Hephaistos. The latter has so skillfully craft ed the figures on the shield that some appear to engage in actual combat even as others have succumbed and, as corpses, restore a sense of stillness to the inherently static medium of which Hephaistos is a master-manipulator. The intense grimness of the battle scene is a fleeting interruption of the pleasant, even idyllic imagery that covers much of the shield?even though the inset of abject carnage is representative of what occurs across the Iliad and is an emphatic anticipation of the dire conflicts that, from the outset, com pose the shield's raison d'?tre. Homer's detailed census of depictions continues for another seventy lines. With the terrors of war temporarily tabled, Hephaistos proceeds to depict such benign, cooperation-filled activities as the ploughing of a field, the harvesting of grain, the gathering of ripe grapes, and?what may be most significant of all with regard to inculcating a sense of community?collective dancing. The visualization of groups of dancers can certainly be tied to some tem plate or constructive sub-stratum of whatever is signified by such a notion as "the fiber of a community" or "cultural process." And perhaps this correla tion is especially the case when?as represented on this developing, emergent shield?young men and women are almost ecstatically engaged in their work, harvesting grapes as they dance, sing, and happily shriek to the accom paniment of a lugubrious yet dulcet commemorative song to the harvest deity Linos. With signal aptness, William McNeill?historian of cultural rhythms?enunciates the imbrications that may here obtain between</page><page sequence="6">60 College Literature 35.4 [Fall 2008] physique, physiology, and cognition. Commenting on a mid-second-millen nium B.C.E. work of Cretan pottery known as the "HarvesterVase," McNeill proposes that "the custom of community-wide dancing on festive occasions is probably as old as humankind itself. Extravagant expenditure of muscular energy in dance and song is the most fundamental of all human devices for consolidating community feeling, simply because it arouses a warm sense of togetherness diminishing personal conflicts and facilitating cooperation" (1995, caption facing p. 86).7 Such statements as these are very plausible and appealing?even as they disclose a nostalgia for a past or otherwise distant site of communal harmo ny. Evident here are strong overtones of ergonomie efficacy as well. At the very least, the notion of a contented, self-sufficient ensemble of households is implied in such references?Homer's as well as McNeill's?to gladsome dancing amid cornucopian harvests. And just as McNeill looks back to pre industrial communities that at least putatively attained solidarity through "village-wide dancing on festival occasions" (1995,153), so Homer's ekphra sis at this point enunciates a longing for peace and celebration beyond the purview of the shield, somewhere beyond the tragic purposes for which this instrument of war has been brought into at least fictive existence. There is a trenchant cultural irony, then, in the fact that so much pastoral discourse has found its way onto the surface of some of Achilles' defensive gear. At the same time, whatever its resemblance to some actual tool of warfare, the shield is a non-material, imagined item that is an accouterrnent of Homer's immediate world, an era for which Ilion and the extended campaigns are mat ters in illo tempore, safely detached from a presumably more tranquil interval in the chronicles of archaic Greece. And hence for the scattered communities inhabited by "Homer" and his contemporaries (over several generations as the Homeric texts evolved and attained a more or less final form), an agrarian ideal has been rendered, an optimized perspective on agricultural production and a way of Ufe that now has depth and resonance following a long-concluded war that has been amelioratively re-packaged via the refractions of poetry and myth. The dance-motif is presented first in an explicitly agricultural context (the grape harvest) and a second time more abstractly as Hephaistos con structs a space for dancing and fills it with a large group of lambent, leaping participants. (This is also the penultimate ekphrastic segment [11. 590-605] of the shield account; a mere two lines referring to the encircling ocean close of the entire sequence.) The rustic dimension is recessed in this second example (even though the dancing girls are i(alphesiboiai" or pretty enough to merit oxen as their bride-price). Hence, with all that has come before (e.g., harvest, debate, ambush, scene of ploughing), the celebratory or ludic</page><page sequence="7">Nathaniel Wallace 61 exertions of the young men and women here depicted are more ideally an exercise that can strengthen the fiber of the body-politic. Together with the notion of salubrious, well-coordinated, and pleasura ble activity that also furthers community well-being, the Homeric text at this point suggests an intriguing dimension of experimentation, of try-out. It is as if to declare that there is a fundamental joy in recognizing that certain per sonal and collective energies are available for exploring profitably whatever enticing avenues for cultural or other fashioning present themselves. Hence at times the dancers move with seeming effortlessness (apparently in a large circle) on their well-trained feet, and they do so in a manner that the Homeric bard finds?interjecting a simile?reminiscent of a potter testing out his whirling wheel in order to assure himself that it moves as it should: At times they danced with knowing feet so lightly, as when a potter, squatting and manipulating his wheel, tries it out to see how it spins. (//. 18.599-601; my translation) Germane at this point is Albert Cook's observation that "being often firm in the visual base of items brought into comparison, and always so in the implied clarity of visible elements it names, the Homeric simile can pro ceed assuredly and expansively towards enriching its complications" (1985, 210).8Thus cognitive energies and synergies are brought into play as the pot ter turns his wheel. Some long-standing technique or motif from ceramic discourse is about to be applied?or perhaps some new aesthetic notion will spring forth?that will govern the production of a work of art (which, con ceivably, is only a humble one intended for ordinary domestic use). At the same instant, Hephaistos labors on the shield, no doubt in accordance (as for the dancers and potter) with certain community expectations?for example, traditional notions of pattern, design, and function. The divine metal-work er is certainly improvising, innovating as well. The forging of a community (if only in the abstract, as an idealization ) is underway. Thus far, the varied picturings of community in Homer can mostly be accommodated in terms of Victor Turner's thoughts on 1) communitas as a matrix of equality and social collaboration and on 2) liminality as the peri odic intervention of non-threatening free-fall wherein divergent modes of cultural experimentation?manifested especially via artistic creativity and performance?can be entertained, if not adopted into everyday norms and protocols.9 Yet subjective elements may also be embedded in the Homeric text that are in keeping with the far looser structure of a quite different com munity, one accommodating discrete, individual desires, allegiances, and impulses that are minimally subject to communal restrictions and/or author izations. Within the Iliad as a whole, Achilles is both an antagonistic and gal</page><page sequence="8">62 College Literature 35.4 [Fall 2008] vanizing factor whose actions must be tolerated. Not to be overlooked in this regard is the ungainly Hephaistos, almost bizarre in his appearance, who fash ions a wondrous shield so complex that it can scarcely be visualized, at least not according to the immense verbal pile-up, the prolonged ekphrasis that it has inspired. The results are even more anomalous when one considers that Thetis has not at all requested such an extraordinary artifact. What she ini tially asked for (II. 18.457-60) was durable and serviceable armor that would prove adequate for her son's substantial martial ambitions.The superfluity and elaborateness of Hephaistos' efforts suggest a singularity, a love of embellish ment and of the exercise of talent for their own sake. Some inner imperative is hinted at that requires an expenditure of psychic?and muscular?energy quite in excess of whatever is needed for the fulfillment of a community based agenda. Yet the examples (and the existences) of Achilles and Hephaistos transpire on a semi-divine and divine level respectively. In these mythical figures, there may well lie some conceptual foreshadowing of the domination-free, idiosyncrasy-tolerant community envisioned by Agamben. On the specifically human plane that the shield description lavishly sets forth, the potential inhabitants of an alternative social entity are perhaps only 1) the insistent litigant who refuses a settlement (18.500) and 2) the fictive potter who so briefly (but it may be, profoundly) may have departed mentally from the communal matrix, is at liberty to reflect on his craft, and is perhaps con structively lost in dialogue with his own, inward determinations. Discussion now turns to the closing (and climactic) chapters of Exodus?the second of the two major texts that this essay is committed to addressing.10 On first inspection, the salient disparities between these two documents may seem so imposing as to preclude the discovery of adequate grounds for comparison. Hence the enterprise of delineating meaningful parallels with regard to how communities?Hellenic as well as Hebraic?coagulate and seek to define themselves may come across as ques tionable. For one text is an example of polished oral epic quite at home with the visual while the other is a m?lange of sacred narratives wherein visual dimensions are often downplayed, and a tradition of written discourse begins to assert itself.11 Visual art is largely eschewed in Exodus with some quite notable exceptions: the blasphemous calf, the enigmatic cherubim, and the impressively substantial decorative elements involved in the construction of the tabernacle and ark, the latter serving as the container of tablets inscribed with divine law. Dance is a tool demonstrating communal integrity in the case of Homer, but in this section of Exodus, dancing becomes emblematic of collective degeneration and iniquity. While these two captivating textual sites thus pose impediments to a comparative hermeneutics of communities, there are shared frontiers?even if</page><page sequence="9">Nathaniel Wallace 63 a quest for overlapping domains may incur disappointment. Among the com monalities, an aura of collective declamation inhabits both Homeric song and the biblical archive. It is in other words reasonable to affirm that there is an epic dimension in Moses' efforts to establish God's law as in Homer's account of the elaboration of Achilles' shield. Each society seeks to locate itself within a culture of memory, each offering a highly edited version that has foregrounded key figures and incidents suspended in an inaccessible and exalted past. In addition, each community can be said to subsist within a cul tural poetics of wilderness or midbar.12 The jubilant quadrants of Achilles' shield deflect, for a moment, the bru tal human and physical terrain situated just beyond the gates of the city of Troy. No immense hermeneutic labor is necessary, however, to uncover par allels between the harsh environment challenging the expatriate Hebrews and that confronting the marauding, avenging Greeks. For the Homeric war riors, the Trojan plain is inhospitable, and it is a purview of prolonged encampment, physical vulnerability, and challenges to social cohesion. Amid overall isolation, each community (Hellenic or Hebraic) must shore up its resources and define its basic values in order to continue as a collective unit that, because of the factor of isolation, is inevitably both paradigm and an example or instantiation of an identifiable genre of community, whether Hebraic or Hellenic. Hence each group can define itself only if it survives, if it can ensure its own continuation for an indefinite period. During the same interval, if the campaign to survive is successful, the task of self-definition will have been completed as part of the process. However, as already seen as the shield was scrutinized, the narrative of unfurling an idealization can also entail a deterioration, a glimpse of chaos and of destructive motivations that must be avoided even if the threat of apocalypse is never expunged. Thus Homer includes on the shield an inset of desperate and nearly indiscriminate slaughter as the denizens of a city mili tarily engage their antagonists. Similarly, when Moses descends from Sinai with the sacred tablets, he discovers?as forewarned by God?that the Hebraic people, though aspiring to a divine covenant, have instead conspired to construct and worship an idol calf and to engage in licentious dancing. In the ensuing upheaval, not only does Moses demolish the tablets; he also reduces the golden icon to a powder, mixes this residue with water, and com pels the Israelites to consume the mixture (Exodus 32.20). The meaning of this degrading act of discipline and punishment has been much discussed.13 But whatever else is involved, some mechanism of cultural process is at work. A return to the basis of community may be sought, perhaps a matrix (as defined by Victor Turner) of relationships "between leveled and equal total and individuated human beings." If the</page><page sequence="10">64 College Literature 35.4 [Fall 2008] "remedy" could only have restored a sense of communitas, a vitalized social organism might then have manifested itself, a collective entity within which each discrete human unit is "open and unspecialized," to cite two of Turner's criteria. Moses at that very point could have tapped "a spring of pure possi bility" (1974, 202) that would have initiated a healthful cognizance of limi nality and the recognition of pathways to new plateaux of spiritual and other excellence. And perhaps such an outcome does eventually emerge although Moses at this point proceeds very much as a discrete individual, idiosyncrat ically, hence in a fashion that contrasts sharply with the widely shared par ticipation in cultural review and revision heralded by Turner as essential in a bonafide community (241-42). Moses finds that the Hebrew populace remains "out of control" (Exodus 32.25), even after that cryptic remedy for spiritual turpitude has been admin istered. Another rash directive ensues, and Moses orders L?vite loyalists to slaughter the dissenters or whoever is meant by "brother, neighbor, and kin" (32.27). Careful readers of this passage may find it difficult to concur with Sarnas assessment that "quite likely, the potion administered to all the Israelites has as its purpose to determine the guilty ones, presumably the three thousand who subsequently lost their lives" (1996, 220).14 A massive barrier is slammed across any hypothetical entryway to the mediation of reli gious or other differences within this society in exile. Excluded at this junc ture are any number of possible communities, whether conceived of as flexi ble, adaptive unions (Turner) or as harmonious disaggregations (Agamben). At the same time, a narrative and cultural nadir is reached, one analogous to the scene of rank anti-community that Hephaistos depicts on the shield as hap less regiments battle desperately outside the walls of the city besieged. The parallel with Homer continues with respect to the aftermath of trau ma and internecine conflict. For in both texts, the descent into a moral and psychic abyss gives way to new agendas and idealizations.The Hebrew God has re-embraced the chastened Israelites at least as mysteriously as Hephaistos fash ions fertile fields and agrarian communities immediately after having depicted a horrid battlefield. And once the ineffable carnage and other chastisements have taken place, God re-issues the many stipulations of His covenant. Collective work begins on the construction of a special, portable purview (ark [aron ha'edut] and tabernacle [mishkan]) that will house holy tablets. As virtual ly all members of the Hebrew populace contribute requisite materials and labor, Exodus narrates a people's work that epitomizes desire for a stable, iden tifiable community15 The enterprise also sets the stage for the installment of liturgy (etymologically, "the people's work") and other sacred behaviors infi nitely repeatable in a world given over to caprice and contingency.</page><page sequence="11">Nathaniel Wallace 65 An idealized collective discourse holds sway for the remainder of Exodus. For reflective readers, however, this discourse is at least somewhat problematic as a now cohesive and pious community undertakes to execute divine instructions. As early as the seventeenth century, rationalist readers of Exodus were sensible of a contradiction between the elaborately, even lavish ly ornamented sacred structures tooled by the Israelites and God's prohibi tion against representations of the divine as stated at Exodus 20.4 and 34.17. It can be argued that only the worship of idols has been proscribed.16 In any case, valuable focus on the overall issue is provided by Egyptologist Jan Assmann's review of a 1685 treatise by John Spencer, a Cambridge Hebraist, on Moses and his epic enterprise. Assmann does well to call attention to Spencer's sighting of a gap between fundamental Hebrew beliefs and an open ness?widely evident in archaic religions?to "the visible dimension of reli gion." Hence, it may be that "in this respect ancient Hebrew religion was much closer to its cultural environment?especially to Ancient Egypt?than in its belie?." And thus to soften?if only to a minimal degree?the aftermath of the tragic conflict that erupted at Sinai, it could be that "to achieve visibility God even conceded to his people images which were strictly forbidden on the theoretical or theological level. The ark of the covenant and the Cherubim are to be understood as visualizations of the divine presence" (Assmann 1997,73). So Spencer, as well as others concerned, would have it that it is especial ly the sculpted images of the Cherubim that "bluntly violate the strict ani conism of the Israelite cult. They are tolerable only as 'hieroglyphs' or sym bols." (Assmann 1997, 73). Thus Sarna, having noted that "it was from the empty space between them that the divine Voice emanated" (1996, 211), finds a "key to understanding" in the biblical epithet, "enthroned on the Cherubim." Sarna then makes a transition from puzzling material accouterment to "hiero glyph" or sacred metaphor with the claim that the above epithet "clearly indi cates a conception of the Cherubim as bearers of God's throne, and since they are invariably portrayed with wings, the intention is to express in art form, and poetically, God's mobility or ... omnipresence ..." (211-12). Whether allegorized or not, the possibly extraneous cherub is conceded by Sarna and other Old Testament commentators to be at least a hybrid?if not a flatly heterodox?element, and probably envisioned by Moses and his contemporaries "as having the body of an animal, such as a bull or lion, and the head of a human. Figures like the Cherubim (karibu in Akkadian) were established in ancient Mesopotamian folklore as creatures that mediated between man and his god, bringing prayers before the deity and guarding holy places." (Plaut 1981, 612). Such concerns and accommodations indeed qualify if they do not seri ously compromise the aura of idealization that emerges toward the close of</page><page sequence="12">66 College Literature 35.4 [Fall 2008] Exodus. A faultline may here interfere with the abstract and pietistic significa tions of this account of spiritual construction. It is also possible, however, to locate in the figure of the Cherubim-and more generally in the myriad mate rials and skills that bring the tabernacle and its contents into existence?a wel come lapse, a fortunate fall that humanizes and mitigates the intense, authori ty-based seriousness of Mosaic spirituality. And if apprehended as figures of community, the multiform cherubim are again suggestive (Exodus 25.18-21, 37.7-9). There are after all two of these odd entities atop the ark of the covenant, and they face each other, a "head count" and positioning of persons constituting what is minimally necessary for conceptualizing a community.17 Given the sacred context, this minute community is first of all perceiv able as a gathering of worshipers. But the cross-cultural inheritance of the Cherubim implies other dimensions as well. Some adumbration of the inclu sive human community beyond Sinai is implicit. The hybridicity of these fig ures can be taken to designate the participation of varied societies (although the image is only partly anthropomorphic).These hybrid entities also suggest the coexistence?in the same aesthetic ensemble?of indigenous or folkloric trends and "high" culture elements.18 It is worth recognizing that the crafts men of the ark and tabernacle are quite skilled, but they are after all escapees from Egyptian construction sites. Hence the shying away from representa tionalism and the drift toward geometricity as the ark and tabernacle are assembled are roughly in keeping with the former job-descriptions of these craftsmen (Sarna 1996, 20-24). The hybrid Cherubim in any case also manage to find their way?this time, indefinitely numerous?into the design of a curtain that demarcates and conceals the innermost section of the inner tabernacle; i.e., where the ark is located (Exodus 26.31 and 36.35). (See also the diagram in Plaut 1981, 601.) Their presence here and atop the ark itself may well declare an inter cession between the divine and man, a facilitation of spiritual communing across ontic categories. Yet again, there is an insinuation of the larger context, for the sense of a social presence is further enhanced when one considers that Cherubim in fact permeate this pious scenario, for these genial beings are also included as a motif in the fabric that will form the walls of the entire inner tabernacle within the larger tent or mishkan (Exodus 26.1, 36.8-9).19 A bit like Homer's assembled dancers at the close of the shield ekphrasis, the multiple, ambient Cherubim are redolent of a community in formation, in the midst of organizing itself and settling upon its foundational requirements. Thus across discursive and cultural divides, there are indeed occasions for and zones of rapprochement as Homeric and Hebraic communities reveal themselves and begin to coagulate. Amid various long-distance parallels and correspondences, an especially intriguing opportunity emerges via recourse</page><page sequence="13">Nathaniel Wallace 67 to Elaine Scarry's analysis of radiant ignition (my italics). Scarry has employed this phrase to identify a strategy whereby textual intensity is generated through reference to radiance or luminosity that in turn calls attention to an object. The illumination is, however, coupled with the object's eclipse or at least the partial concealment of whatever is highlighted (1999, 8, 77-88). Conveniently for the present argument, Scarry frequently refers to the Iliad to illustrate the resources of radiant ignition. For example, movement is often involved as instances of this textual device play themselves out; e.g., the campfires of the Greeks engagingly flicker, yet "what moves may only be the light itself (the gleam rising off a shield, the flash from a helmet)" (85). The notion of radiant ignition assists with an understanding of how communities and their ideals are depicted in the Iliad and Exodus?and par ticularly with regard to a demarcation of cognitive distances that remain unbridged as cultural and communal luminosities insinuate themselves but remain desired, not quite realized. A passage that is strikingly relevant (though omitted from Scarry's discussion) is a simile found in Iliad 19 as Achilles grasps?at last, after much deferral?the monumental shield that Hephaistos has so ingeniously wrought. Massive and highly reflective, its gleam is far reaching, yet its long-awaited placement into service entails an aura of inac cessibility as well. While there is substantial generation of light, the impres sion is similar to a view of the distant moon, or what is worse, the scene is as when a flash of light appears to sailors at sea, a blaze of kindled fire. Up there it burns, visible, coming from some isolated outpost. But stormy gales carry them, unwilling, upon the piscine sea, far from those they love. Just so, the gleam of Achilles' wondrously crafted shield flashed into the sky. (//. 19.375-80; my translation) The ironies?and the disappointments?are numerous and profound in this distinguished example of radiant ignition. As Gregory Nagy points out, "the fire promises r?int?gration" to the beleaguered mariners. "Yet, ironical ly, the fire of r?int?gration is itself isolated and remote, much as the hero who is himself signaled by its flame" (1979, 339). And not only that, the commu nal idealizations warmly depicted on the shield are suddenly dismissed, not visible amid the bursts of reflected light as the ultimate warrior prepares to utilize this imposing armament amid the agonies and horrors of war. The dancers, contented peasants, and other representatives of wholesome com munity life have vanished, here replaced?within the simile?by sadly diminished ironic counterparts?schools of fish, hard-pressed sailors, a home stead on some remote promontory.</page><page sequence="14">68 College Literature 35.4 [Fall 2008] It is surely not the case that all reminiscences of Hephaistos' artistry are lost, for the depictions on the shield are myriad and all-inclusive.Yet the tran quil optimizations are here absent as Achilles readies himself for battle and so, it can be said, participates in actualizing the contrastive, antithetical insets of bellicosity and conflict also much a part of this representational panoply. An analogous and relevant?if seemingly distant?example of radiant ignition occurs in Exodus 34.19-35.This complex passage deals with the state of Moses' physiognomy as a consequence of his ascent of Sinai following the golden calf debacle and the massacre. Moses is at this point clearly infused with numinous energy, and constitutionally, he is no doubt under consider able stress as a result of a lengthy fast in combination with much exposure to the elements. The prophet, however, "... was not aware that the skin of his face was radiant" (Exodus 34.29) following his conversations with God. Aaron and the rest of the Israelites shrink from Moses because of the efful gence, and thereafter, he takes up the practice of veiling his face except for occasions when he retreats and listens to God's words.20 There are indeed discrepancies between the circumstances of Moses' radiance and those of Achilles' glowing shield. On a basic, physical level, whatever visualization is conjured up by the Old Testament text registers no impairment of features and attributes; there is no flickering or flashing that obscures inspection of the patriarch's visage. In this alternate version of radi ant ignition (which?as in the example from Homer?serves to generate considerable textual interest), the temporary disappearance of the illuminat ed item (here, the visage of Moses) is not a simultaneous, inevitable conse quence of the factor of radiance. Instead, the iridescence and the interrup tion of visibility?first of the patriarch's face and then of the man him self?are consecutive phenomena. The radiance will persist and can only attain its phase of greatest evidence when the veil is removed; yet, at such intervals, Moses is sequestered, in consultation with God. In any case, the uncanniness is pronounced, and a new partition?one that is psychological and spiritual as well?emerges between Moses and his associates, in addition to whatever deferences and protocols are already in place. And because of this unanticipated intervention, there is additional twisting or tweaking in the transmission and apprehension of whatever is meant by "community" and attendant values in the context of Exodus. Perhaps Moses in this specific context, with the singular attire that he has adopted, in addition to the special role that he has assumed, is a distant fore runner of the loosely confederated inhabitants of some idealized global vil lage. It is also significant, in pursuing a possible connection between Old Testament culture and the potpourri of individualities proposed by Agamben, that the altered behavior and dress exhibited by Moses are toler</page><page sequence="15">Nathaniel Wallace 69 ated, are accepted by his colleagues and compatriots without apparent fric tion. It may be that a connection with Agamben is found here and nowhere else in this segment of Exodus.21 At the same time, with the onset of Moses' mysterious radiance and his wearing of a veil, the ineffable God of archaic Israel has become at least a bit more cach?. The prospective community that Moses undertakes to construct is not specifically jeopardized because of this development, but the implication is that the wandering Israelites?perhaps like Homer's sailors tossed about at sea?must intensify their efforts to form and maintain a cohesive social unit especially if they wish to qualify for rescue. Notes 1 Lucy McDiarmid's reading of Auden's poem is a perceptive one (1990, 127 33). Among other insights, McDiarmid finds that the work is "structured by a series of escalating demands (on the part of the audience) and escalating denials (on the part of the shield)'' (128-29). 2 For successful attempts to apply the matrix of a "coming community" to pre modern cultures, see Statkiewics and Reed (2005, passim), who consider the repre sentation of the city of Thebes during the fifth century B.C.E., and Kay (2007, 45 46, 56-57, 68-69), whose focus is medieval France. 3 References to and citations of the Homeric text are based on the Bud? / Belles Lettres edition (1967) established by Paul Mazon et al. 4 Heffernan's valuable discussion (1993, 10-22) of the ekphrastic resources expended on the shield emphasizes the tensions that the Homeric text generates between the imaginary shield and the verbal discourse ostensibly being employed to describe it. Ironically, claims Heffernan, "the shield is shielded by the very language that purports to reveal it to us" (1993, 14). Heffernan concludes with the paradox that this key section of the Iliad "bears continual witness to the Daedalian power, complexity, and verisimilitude of visual art even as [Homer] aspires to rival that art in language ..." (22). 5 Jonathan Hall takes exception to the usual reading of the judgment scene; i.e., that "a situation where judicial judgments aim simply to resolve feuds between fam ilies and prevent vendettas has given way to one in which the community's mem bers are held accountable to an external, impersonal standard of comportment . . ." (2007,133).This historian argues for a social matrix that is still in an archaic phase. All the same, it is reasonable to propose that, along with the fabricating endeavors of Hephaistos and the tale-teller's "manipulation" of an oral text, the not-yet-resolved judicial segment can be seen as an insinuation of ongoing cultural process. 6 There is debate among the commentators regarding whether it is indeed one group that is debating or whether the two groups are collectively considering the two alternative strategies. See Edwards (1995, 218-19). 7 Barbara Ehrenreich proceeds in a similar vein (2006, 21-30) but proposes an even more foundational role for dance in the founding of the earliest human com munities. Ehrenreich hypothesizes that primitive "groups?and the individuals with in them?capable of holding themselves together through dance would have had an</page><page sequence="16">70 College Literature 35.4 [Fall 2008] evolutionary advantage over more weakly bonded groups and individuals: the advan tage of being better able to mount a collective defense against any animals or hostile humans who encroached on their territory or otherwise threatened them" (24).The argument is intriguing even if, within Homer's ekphrasis, the dancing is ostensibly celebratory and not a prelude to conflict. Given the martial context, the notion that there is some residue of dual valences is not difficult to accept. 8 Yet the "implied clarity," many readers of Homer would argue, goes only so far. Thus relevant also for an appreciation of the dynamics of the Homeric simile are the comments of Oliver Taplin (2007, 178-79), who calls attention to the inclusion of intimations of dissimilarity, "a great range of similarities between the world of the poem and the world?or rather worlds?of its audiences," and an intriguing "local and temporal non-specificity" (179). 9 An illuminating setting forth of the aesthetic implications of Turner's thought is provided by David Raybin (1990, 21-41). The collection of essays edited by Kathleen M. Ashley is as a whole valuable in this regard. 10 Discussion of Exodus is based on the Union of American Hebrew Congregations' 1981 edition of the Pentateuch?hereafter referred to as Plaut.The volume consists of the Hebrew text with the Jewish Publication Society's English translation, together with commentaries by W. G. Plaut, B. J. Bamberger, and W. W. Hallo. The commentary on Exodus is Plaut's. 11 The boundaries between Homeric and biblical narrative have been frequent ly and thoughtfully investigated. Still useful is Auerbach's distinction between Homeric "foreground"?a fascination with details, surface brilliance, and explana tion?and Old Testament "background"?an overriding concern with the spiritual, with intentions and motivations never fully viewable (1953, 3-23). In a well-argued follow-up, Robert Kawashima (2004) seeks to elucidate the contrasts between Homeric and biblical narrative by emphasizing "the different possibilities available to oral tradition and written verbal art ('literature' in the etymologically precise sense of the term)" (103). Thus Kawashima finds that within recurrent plot-sequences or "type-scenes," Homer adheres to the principle of "variation without transforma tion"; ". .. the variations ... are 'well behaved,' that is, they operate within precisely defined boundaries" (109). In the case of "the radically different art of biblical nar rative" (110), Kawashima discerns a "restless impulse to innovate, to transform and reinterpret convention" (111).Kawashima relates such distinctions to determinations and possibilities inherent in the resources of each mode of composition(l 13-14). The notion that Homer and the Bible inhabit two opposing slopes?one oral, the other written?of a discursive divide is rather widely accepted. In view of the seemingly oral aspects of Old Testament narrative, John Van Seters, for instance, endorses the position that, during literacy's early stages in Near Eastern antiquity, it was often necessary to orally communicate written texts to audiences unable to read or write (1984, 139).Tertel advances a similar perspective, maintaining, for instance, that "the variations in parallel texts in the Old Testament are paralleled by differences between versions of Assyrian Royal Annals" (Tertel 1994, 14n22). From the standpoint of the present discussion, a side-effect of long-standing aca demic emphases on the distinctiveness of the respective discourses (Homer, the Old</page><page sequence="17">Nathaniel Wallace 71 Testament) is an augmentation of the challenge of identifying common elements and shared perspectives within the two textualities and their cultures. 12 As Exodus maven Nahum Sarna points out, "The Hebrew term for wilder ness is midbar, which has a broad range of meanings that included uncultivated pas tureland as well as arid, desolate wastes and rocky plateaux" (1996, 106). 13 Robert Alter observes in his comment on Exodus 32.20 that "numerous com mentators have noted the (approximate) analogy to the ordeal by drinking to which the woman suspected of adultery is submitted (Numbers 5:11-31)." 14 This interpretation is tied to the perception of a parallel with Numbers 5:11 31. Herein, however, the woman who drinks a mixture of dust and water and hap pens to be guilty is thereby effectively cursed and incurs infertility as a consequence; there is no application of direct corporal punishment as in Exodus 32.27-29. 15 Collins offers the observation?pertinent here?that "this portable Holy of Hohes also harked back to the Bedouin past, a legendary patriarchal age of innocence and independence, when the Hebrew clans and tribes moved continually with their sheep, goats, and cattle over the grasslands west of the Arabian Desert" (1991, 33). 16 As Alter maintains," ... the ban against fashioning images is a ban against cul tic icons (verse 5,' You shall not bow to them ...') and not, as some currents of later tradition concluded, a comprehensive prohibition of image-making" (2004,429 n. 4). The following commentary is particularly concerned with an ambiguous, prob lematic group of figures, the "Cherubim." For the sake of consistency, the initial "c" has been capitalized throughout. 17 The writings of philosopher Emmanuel Levinas are worth consulting in this regard. Levinas is recurrently concerned with the varied ethical implications of the visage, especially in confrontation between self and other primal encounters from which human inter-relations emanate. In ?thique et infini, for instance, Levinas com ments that he asks himself whether one can speak of a gaze turned toward the face, for the gaze is knowledge, percep tion. I think rather that access to the face is ethical from the start. It is when you see a nose, eyes, a countenance, a chin, and you can describe them, that you turn yourself toward another as toward an object. The better way to encounter another is not to even notice the color of the eyes! (. . . je me demande si l'on peut parler d'un regard tourn? vers le visage, car le regard est connaissance, perception. Je pense plut?t que l'acc?s au visage est d'embl?e ?thique. C'est lorsque vous voyez un nez, des yeux, un front, un menton, et que vous pouvez les d?crire, que vous vous tournez vers autrui comme vers un objet. La meilleure mani?re de rencontrer autrui, c'est de ne pas m?me remarquer la couleur de ses yeux!) [1982, 79] It is reasonable to suggest that the rather unspecific?but hardly impersonal?mode of encounter highlighted by Levinas to an extent parallels the generalized, somewhat abstract appearance and positioning of the Cherubim atop the arc. And out of such non-confrontational encounters between individuals, Levinas sees the starting point for discourse, hence society, cultures, traditions: "The visage and discourse are tied. The visage speaks. It speaks in that it is that which rends possible and begins all dis</page><page sequence="18">72 College Literature 35.4 [Fall 2008] course." ("Visage et discours sont li?s. Le visage parle. Il parle, en ceci que c'est lui qui rend possible et commence tout discours" [1982, 82; my translations]). On the topic of the face in the philosophy of Levinas, see also RudiVisker 1998, especially 191-94 and 196-201. 18 Although Nestor Canclini elaborates the notion of "hybrid cultures" with regard to Latin America at the close of modernity, his observations on the ways in which cultures intermingle and blend may be at least partly applicable to the con text of Exodus. Canclini seeks to "understand the presence of indigenous crafts and vanguard art catalogs on the same coffee table." He would explain what "painters are looking for when, in the same painting, they cite pre-Columbian and colonial images along with those of the culture industry, and then reelaborate them using computers and lasers" (1995,2). Given the highly liminal situation of the post-Egypt and pre-Canaan Hebrews, various manifestations of cultural hybridization should be expected. Also quite relevant in this regard is Canclini's sub-chapter entitled "Intersections: From the Modern to the Postmodern" (241-49). 19 There are some uncertainties in the translation and the description as well. Among the difficulties, Plaut points to the recurrence of two Hebrew locutions, "mishkan" and "oheV (typically translated as "tabernacle" or "dwelling" [mishkan] and "tent" [oheI\ respectively). As a result of an apparent blending of textual lineages "sometimes agreeing, sometimes differing," Plaut concludes that it is "nearly impos sible to form an entirely clear picture" of the overall sacred purview (1981, 600). Despite the ambiguities, translators-for instance, Robert Alter and the JPS ver sion?agree that the puzzling Cherubim are well represented in the textile furnish ings. At 36.8-9, however, in Alters phrasing, "Cherubim" (keruvim) refers only to the pair of statuettes atop the ark (2004, 520). 20 Alter (512 n. 29) does well to review and critique the semantic crux inher ent in the locution "qaran," which is found only in this passage: "The Greek trans lation of Aquila and the Latin Vulgate famously understood ['qaran'] to mean 'sprouted horns' from qeren, 'horn'), a virtually impossible reading .... It makes more sense to see something terrifyingly luminous .... The notion of divine radi ance enveloping the head or face of a god, a king, or a priest appears in numerous Mesopotamian texts . . . ." 21 Additional candidates for inclusion in some Agambenic community would seem to be the master-craftsmen Bezalel, overseer of the construction of the taber nacle and its contents, and his designated assistant, Oholiab. Both are accomplished multi-taskers with "the skill to do any work-of the carver, the designer, the embroi derer ..." etc. (Exodus 35.35). If they are parallel in skills and their role to Hephaistos, their discretionary prerogatives are quite limited. In this context, the search for the quodlibet, for the singularity, does not appear to succeed. Their talents are tied to the execution of a well-defined collective task.
