The conference was dedicated to the study of the most important work in medieval Jewish mysticism, the Zohar, which was composed at the end of the 13th century. The conference was a continuation of two previous ones, held in the same format: the first, in 1984, was dedicated to the study of ancient Jewish mysticism in the talmudic period — Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism, and the second, in 1986, was dedicated to the beginnings of Jewish mysticism in medieval Europe. The proceedings of these two conferences were published in this series in 1987 and 1988, and now the third one, on the Zohar and its period, is being published to coincide with the Tenth World Congress of Jewish Studies which is convening at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in August 1989. These three volumes contain over fifty scholarly studies, which present an up-to-date survey of research in the history of Jewish mysticism from its early beginnings in the High Middle Ages up to the early 14th century. The conference was held in the halls of the Israeli Academy of Sciences and Arts in Jerusalem. Several dozens of scholars from many countries took part, and had an opportunity to participate in the detailed discussions that followed each lecture. Some of the theses raised in the conference are discussed and argued over even now, a year and a half after the conference ended. Many of the lectures and debates were based on the studies of the Zohar and its period by the late Prof. Scholem and by Prof. Isaiah Tishby, who participated actively throughout the conference. The lectures delivered sought to suggest [VII]</page><page sequence="3">INTRODUCTION new ideas and possibilities concerning the history and development of the Zohar and the understanding of its ideas and literary forms. The present volume contains studies based on most of the lectures delivered at the conference*, and several papers sent by scholars who could not participate in the conference itself. Most of the studies presented at the conference — and in this volume — dealt directly with the Zohar itself, its authorship, its symbolism and ideas, and its use of narative and homiletical forms to convey them. In contra-distinction to the two previous conferences, in which the lectures described developments covering many generations or even centuries, most of the papers in the present volume deal with the unique spiritual achievement of the Zohar, one of the peaks of Jewish spirituality which arouses admiration and astonishment even after many years of scholarly study. The opening lecture was delivered by Prof. Yehuda Liebes of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and his study of the same subject — "How the Zohar was written" — opens this volume. On the basis of studies by G. Scholem, I. Tishby and A. Altman concerning the relationship between the writings of R. Moshe de Leon (Ramdal) and the Zohar, Prof. Liebes raises a series of questions concerning the accepted method which cites Ramdal as its author. Among the questions: the ideological and stylistic differences between the text of the Zohar and "Midrash Hane'elam", the contradictions between the teaching of the Zohar and the teaching of Ramdal in his Hebrew compositions and, most of all, the relationship between the various parts of the Zohar and the question of whether it is possible that all of them were written by one author. These and other difficulties brought Prof. Liebes to suggest, "That the Zohar is the work of an entire group which dealt, together, with kabbalistic lore, based on a shared tradition and ancient texts. This group began its activities even before the Zohar One interesting paper is not included in these Proceedings: Mrs. Miriam Yizrael's study of M. Ardon's artistic concept of the story of the creation in the Zohar. The available budget for this publication was not sufficient to cover the price of several colored plates nencessary for the publication of that important subject. [VIII]</page><page sequence="4">INTRODUCTION was written... and some of its members began writing while they describe, in their own words, the activities of the group and develop its work, each according to his own inclination, because the freedom of the kabbalistic creation is the way of the Zohar and belongs to its ideology and to that of the rest of the circle." Liebes still saw Ramdal as a major figure in this group and as the main architect of the Zohar, but added to this the kabbalistic works of R. Bahia ben Asher, R. Yosef ben Shalom Ashkenazi, R. Yosef from Susa, R. Yosef Gikatilla, R. David ben Yehuda he-Hasid and R. Todros ben Yosef Aboulafia. The article suggests that characteristic ideas of these authors appear in the Zohar, and not that the Zohar influenced the formation of these ideas in the minds of the aforementioned figures. Explicit examples back up this thesis. Prof. Liebes stressed that, "The theory of the group raises many historical and philological problems, some of which I can not solve. Some of the answers raise additional questions, of which many will be proven to still need correction, so that one may rightly state that the theory raises more problems than it does solve... it appears to me that it is worthwhile to follow this path, thorny as it may be, and I hope that following this first attempt, additional studies will correct the mistakes." The article's broad survey of the relationship between the Zohar and the central kabbalistic figures who were active during its creation is, without a doubt, an important contribution to an in-depth understanding of the weaving of the kabbalistic tapestry of the Zohar. Prof. Liebes' innovative approach to the question of the Zohar's authorship raised much discussion among the conference's participants, and a critical lecture regarding the approach was delivered by Prof. I. Tishby. Many of the lecturers referred to it in their talks at the conference and in their articles found in this volume. And from the general to the particular: Prof. Moshe Idel of the Hebrew University brought in his study "An Unknown Text from Midrash Hane'elam" a kabbalistic text which was translated into Latin by Reuchlin and which was incorrectly attributed to R. Todros Halevi Aboulafia. R. Hayim Vital, on the other hand, cites it as "Midrash [IX]</page><page sequence="5">INTRODUCTION Hane'elam in manuscript". One version of the text includes many expressions in Aramaic. Prof. Idel proved how this composition belongs to Zoharic literature and to the Midrash Hane'elam, and presented an edition of the text from a Jerusalem manuscript as compared to seven other ones. Six of the manuscripts which include the text also include the "Sha'ar Harazim" of R. Todros Halevi Aboulafia, and based on the connections between R. Moshe de Leon and R. Todros, Prof. Idel concluded that the material may have reached R. Todros Aboulafia and those who copied the text added it to his composition. In his study of "An Iberian Phrase in an Unknown Fragment by the Author of Tikunei Zohar" Dr. Amos Goldreich of Tel Aviv University added an important contribution to the study of the world of the author of the last strata of the Zohar, "Ra'aya Mehemna" and "Tikunei Zohar", a study which was begun by the late Prof. Ephraim Gottlieb. Dr. Goldreich identified a short text entitled "Sod Hasisit" from a manuscript in Florence and proves that the author of this text is probably the author of "Tikunei Zohar" and that the text belongs to the Hebrew compositions of this author. The text states, "Who is not a descendent of Lilith, known in the vernacular as Ishkasha, a hard fire, is a miser" and it appears that a miser was thus called in medieval Castillian and Portuguese. This proves that the author lived, at least for a time, in the Iberian peninsula, although he may have wandered in other areas as well. Prof. Daniel Mat of the Graduate Theologican Union in Berkeley added an important dimension to the study of the pseudo-epigraphy of the Zohar in his article, "Matnita Dilan\ a Technique of Innovation in the Zohar". There is much tension in the Zohar caused by a conflict between the use of ancient sources and the new ideas and style of the author, who uses the traditional methods of expression. Prof. Mat saw the Zohar expression "Milin Hadtin Atikin" as an example of this, but dealt primarily with the expression "Tanian Bematnita Dilan" which is found in the Zohar some thirty times. Under this title the Zohar,s author includes both things based on the Mishnah and kabbalistic [X]</page><page sequence="6">INTRODUCTION secrets of the 13th century, texts from other places in the Zohar and traditions which have no parallel. Prof. Mat pointed to the differences in this expression's use between the "Midrash Hane'elam" in which it refers to midrashic references and the Zohar, which quotes itself under this title. Ramdal, according to Prof. Mat, treats the Mishnah, "as one treats the familiar. He plays with it, studies and changes it. With Holy Chutzpah he finds in it and invents from it all that he wishes to find, and more". The group of studies dealing with the ideas of the Zohar and its symbolic mysticism opens with an article by Prof. Elliot Wolfson from New York University: "The Anthropomorphic and Symbolic Image of the Letters in the Zohar". The author followed the birth and development of the idea which identifies human anatomy with God, as per the ancient "ShiurKomah", and of this form with the alphabet, via the use of names or groups of letters signifying parts of the divine form, both internal and external. Prof. Wolfson examined the development of the mystical concept of language, and the development of the anthropomorphic concept as found in the Zohar. He stated that, "The correlation between the letters and the anatomy found in the Shiur Komah was transferred, in the Zohar, to the human realm, because according to Zoharic anthropomorphism, the human form of man — and not only his soul or spirit — is formed in Godיs imgae. The letters are a matrice from which the upper and lower Man were formed." Prof. Eliot Ginzburg from Oberlin College discussed the mystical interpretation of the Zohar's author to the Havdalah ceremony, including its customs and blessings. This is interwoven with the authors studies concerning the concept of the Shabbat in the Zohar. Here we have a detailed example of the way in which the Zohar's author changes each detail in Jewish traditional ritual to a symbolic mystic system of great power. The author examined the mystical and magical foundation of this transformation, which is of special significance because the Havdalah is a contact point between the sacred and the profane. Prof. Ginzburg uncovered the system of homiletics and associations which serves the Zohar's author in forming [XI]</page><page sequence="7">INTRODUCTION his concept, and discusses the connection of certain customs (such as looking at one,s fingernails) and the halakhic instructions with the mystical symbolism of the Zohar. Prof. Roland Goetchel, of the University of Strasbourg, dedicated his study, "The Conception of Prophecy in the Works of Rabbi Moses de Leon and Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla", to a detailed comparison of the attitude towards this spiritual phenomenon in the Hebrew works of de Leon and Gikatilla, compared to key passages dealing with the subject in the Zohar itself. Prof. Goetchel analyzed the exegesis of central biblical verses concerning prophecy in the works of 13th century kabbalists like Nachmanides and Rabbi Asher ben David, and pointed out their influence on the Zohar generation. Basic problems, like the role of angels and holy divine names in the process of prophecy were described, and the author concluded by emphasizing the increase of the mythical element in the Zohar, compared to the more exegetical logical attitude which prevailed before its appearance. Dr. Bracha Zack, of Ben Gurion University in Beer-Sheva, analyzed in her paper the symbols "Land" (Eretz) and "Land of Israel1' in the Zohar. These symbols are usually connected in Zoharic literature with the tenth divine emanation, the Shekhinah, and they represent the spiritual, supreme "land" from which the physical entity is derived in the process of emanation and creation. Dr. Zack pointed out the relationship between the physical and spiritual "Land of Israel" in the homiletics of the Zohar, and the use made by the mystic of talmudic sayings concerning the subject, many of them comparing the "Land of Israel" to other countries. The sanctity and centrality of the "Land of Israel" in the Zohar give anyone who lives or dies in it a high spiritual status and a mystical contact with the divine Shekhinah. A large part of this Proceedings is dedicated to papers dealing with Zoharic homiletics, narrative and poetics — the literary means used by the author of the Zohar. The paper opening this section is by Prof. Ithamar Gruenwald of Tel Aviv University: "From Talmudic to Zoharic Homiletics". Prof. Gruenwald sought in this study the basic characteristics of kabbalistic homiletical interpretations, and the differences between them and the ancient homiletics of talmudic and [XII]</page><page sequence="8">INTRODUCTION midrashic sages. He put the first work of the Kabbalah, Sefer ha-Bahir, in a central point connecting ancient homiletics with the Zohar. He uses the term "homiletical reality" in order to point out the ways in which mystical homiletics create a new, vibrant environment which does not negate the original meaning of the biblical verse but rather discovers another, esoteric truth hidden in it. Kabbalistic symbolism develops, according to Prof. Gruenwald, in the process of esoteric hermeneutics which brings to light hidden strata of meaning which were uncovered by the kabbalists. The author studied the development of this attitude from Maimonides, via 13th-century kabbalists like Rabbi Bahya ben Asher and Rabbi Abraham Abulafia, to the Zohar. The artistic element in the homiletics of the Zohar is studied by Dr. Michal Oron of Tel-Aviv University. Dr. Oron analyzed in detail a section of the Zohar in the portion of Pinchas, woven around a narrative parable. The various literary means used by the Zohar in this section are united into one whole, which is an artistic achievement as well as a forceful ideological statement. The narrative element is combined with the homiletical one in order to serve the poetic, as well as the mystical, expression of the Zohar. Dr. Mordechai Pechter, of the University of Haifa, studied a section in the Zohar in his paper: "Between Night and Morning: Zohar II 36b-38b", in which he discovers a composition uniting homiletical and narrative elements. He pointed out a rythmn of development in this section, as the story itself goes from a mundane beginning to more and more profound levels, side by side with the enrichment of the homiletical and mystical aspects. While the opening stages of this presentation in the Zohar are given to lesser figures, the peak of the narrative — and that of the mystical meaning — is reached when Rabbi Shimeon Bar Yohai himself appears in the story, and reveals the supreme secret: The nature of the redemption, homiletically compared to the previous stages of the messianic process. Prof. Karl Erich Groezinger of the University of Frankfurt dedicated his paper, "Tradition and Innovation in the Concept of Poetry in the Zohar", to a detailed comparison between the poetics of [XIII]</page><page sequence="9">INTRODUCTION the Zohar and the two previous strata of development of the attitude towards songs and poems: the talmudic one and the mystical one found in the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature. In Hekhalot mysticism, according to Prof. Groezinger, the song and the piyyut are conceived as independent phenomena which are not dependent on a specific historical setting, but are interwoven in the essence of the cosmos as a whole. In the Zohar the author found an element of return to the traditional concept found in the midrash, where this element is regarded as a liturgical one, deeply connected with the historical circumstances reflected in each poem or song. Prof. Moshe Halamish, of Bar Ilan University in Ramat Gan, presented a detailed and exhaustive study of the history of the popular song "Bar Yohai", dedicated to the author of the Zohar. This song was written by Rabbi Shimeon Ibn Lavi in the 16th century, and was printed many times in different contexts. Prof. Halamish analyzed the connection of this song to various rituals, on the Sabbath and the festival of Lag Ba'omer. The author presented a wealth of material concerning the various customs into which this song was interwoven in many Jewish communities in the East, West and in Israel. Another study of the attitude to the Zohar in later Jewish thought was presented by Ms. Zvia Rubin of the Hebrew University: "The Zoharic Works of Rabbi Moses Hayyim Lusatto and his Messianic Attitude". Luzzatto, known in the acronym Ramhal, was an 18th century messianic kabbalist who wrote a "new Zohar", following the language and the format of the medieval work, and using it to express his intense messianic speculations and activities. The place of the Zohar in the eschatology of Ramhal was studied in detail, and the author presented his concept of the Zohar as an eternal light, which is destined to be revealed and light up the cosmos during the messianic redemption. The English part of this volume is opened with the study by Prof. Ivan G. Marcus of the Jewish Theological Seminary of New York: "Exegesis for the Few and for the Many: Judah he־Hasid's Biblical Commentaries". Prof. Marcus analyzed the sources in which Rabbi [XIV]</page><page sequence="10">INTRODUCTION Judah's commentaries are found, most of them early 13th-century ones, and considers the possibility of the existence of oral sources which influenced and directed the Ashkenazi mystic. He studied the various hermeneutical techniques used by Rabbi Judah and his followers, points out the differences found among several works which contain biblical exegesis, and concludes by explaining them as the result of the various groups of readers to which they were intended: the esoteric commentaries to the few, and the exoteric ones, like those in the Sefer Hasidim, for the wide public. Dr. Mark Verman, of St. John University in Minnesota, dedicated his study, "The Development of Yihudim in Spanish Kabbalah1', to one of the most interesting sources which influenced the Zohar: the 13th century group of Jewish mystics known as the Iyyun Circle. In the works of these mystics developed the practice of yihudim, of specific combinations of biblical names of God used in order to express some mystical secret, very often connected with the supreme figure of Metatron. Dr. Verman described in detail the development of this type of mystical symbolism among the various groups of kabbalists in Spain, in the Zohar and in the later part of the Zoharic literature, Ra'aya Mehemna and Tikunei Zohar. Prof. Ronald Kiener of Trinity College, Hartford dedicated his study to the image of Islam in the Zohar. He presented a survey of the studies dedicated to this problem, which seeked parallels between the Zohar and various Moslem ideas and terms. He doubts whether the material collected so far is enough to give a clear picture concerning this problem, unless all the possible references of the Zohar to Ishmael and Islam have been carefully analyzed. Prof. Kiener presented such an analysis involving the figures of Ishmael and Hagar, and especially concerning various parallel practices in the ritual of circumcision. In most sections the author discovered negative attitudes towards Islam, though this does not deny the possibility of Islamic influences on Zoharic symbolism. Prof. Stephen D. Benin, of the University of Tennesee, dedicated his study, "The Mutability of an Immutable God: Exegesis and Individual [XV]</page><page sequence="11">INTRODUCTION Capacity in the Zohar and Several Christian Sources5', to one of the major theological questions which is found in both Jewish and Christian mystical sources. It is the problem of the level of understanding, insight and mystical comprehension possible to various persons from the same text or spiritual phenomenon. This problem is deeply rooted in the concepts of mystical language and of divine revelation, and its result is the stratification of the possibilities of exegesis and individual levels of understanding achieved by different people. Prof. Benin described some basic theological attitudes to this problem by talmudic sages and medieval kabbalists, as well as by Church fathers, medieval Christian mystics and reformers. The last session of the conference was dedicated to the on-going project of preparation of a critical edition of the Zohar and a scholarly commentary on the book. The project is directed by Prof. Rivka Shatz, of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who described its achievements and future plans. The project is supported by the Israeli Academy of Sciences and the Humanities, and its first aim is to present the printed texts of the Zohar and its many manuscripts in a computer program, enabling scholars to have before them all the variants of every section of the work. The portions of the first volume of the Zohar were divided among several scholars who are preparing the critical text and the commentary. The eighteen studies presented in this volume reflect current trends and views concerning the scholarly understanding of the Zohar and its period, but they also reflect the many problems which have not yet received satisfactory answers or adequate academic attention. It is hoped that the publication of this collection will enhance further study of the problems of the authorship of the Zohar, its texts and versions, its mystical theosophy and its literary forms. This conference, like the two previous ones, was convened by the Gershom Scholem Center for the Study of Kabbalah and Jewish Mysticism, directed by Prof. Malachi Beit-Arie, who contributed much to its success. The Robert Bosch Stiftung, GMBH of Stuttgart financed both the conference and the publication of the Proceedings, for which [XVI]</page><page sequence="12">INTRODUCTION we are most thankful. Mr. Avriel Bar-Levav of the Hebrew University organized the conference and saw this volume through the press, and devoted much effort to both. Mrs. Devorah Brosh of the Jewish National and University Library was in charge of the administrative aspects of the conference and this volume, which could not be concluded without her devoted efforts. Mr. Felix Dan, of the Daf Noy Press in Jerusalem and his staff took great pains to publish the volume on time, preserving their high standards of work.
