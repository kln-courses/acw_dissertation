Currently, an  efficient, cost-effective methodology is being implemented to develop a biofidelic rollover dummy. Instead of designing a rollover  dummy from scratch, this methodology identifies a baseline dummy and modifies it to improve its response in a rollover crash. Using  computational models of the baseline dummy, including both multibody (MB) and finite element (FE) models, the dummy’s structure is  continually modified until its response is aligned (using BioRank/CORA metric) with biofidelity targets. A previous study (Part I)  identified the THOR dummy as a suitable baseline dummy by comparing the kinematic responses of six existing dummies with PMHS  response corridors through laboratory rollover testing. In this study (Part II), the whole-body kinematic responses of the THOR MB and  FE models were validated with responses of the physical THOR dummy in experiments that simulated rollover conditions. This step is  necessary to ensure accuracy of the computer-aidedengineering dummy design, thereafter improving confidence in the proposed rollover  dummy design modifications. In addition, to ensure the robustness of the model validation, the sensitivities of the THOR dummy  computational model responses to parameters with uncertainty in the experiment were assessed, including seatbelt pretension, friction,  and dummy seating posture. In summary, both the THOR MB and FE model responses matched well with its physical counterpart.  Future studies (Part III) will focus on using these validated dummy models for rollover dummy design modification and evaluation.

Therefore, the ellipsoid surfaces in the  original THOR MB model were replaced with facet surfaces, which  were based on re-meshing (for reduced mesh density: element size  ∼20-30mm) of the THOR FE model mesh (Figure 2).

Safety / Volume 4, Issue 1 (April 2016) A rollover buck model (including the seat) was developed in both the  MADYMO and LS-DYNA software respectively based on the CAD  drawing of the rollover buck used in the tests (Figure 6). Both the  THOR MB and FE models were then seated and positioned similarly  in the buck models as in the tests. Pre-simulations were run to settle  both THOR models down by applying gravity. Both models were  then belted and a pretension force of 35 Newton was applied at both  the outboard ends of the shoulder and lap belts. For MADYMO, this  was achieved directly with the force actuator feature by specifying a  target force (35 Newton), while for LS-DYNA, the target pretension  was achieved indirectly by using the *BOUNDARY_PRESCRIBED_ MOTION feature to specify a target prescribed displacement history.  Therefore, a trial-and-error process was involved in obtaining the  right amount of displacement to achieve the targeted 35 newton force.  By the end of the belt pretension, the end points of the belts were  switched to rigid and attached to the buck structure to simulate the  3-point-belt restraint (no-retractor). After the belt pretension loading,  the CG roll rate time history measured from the test (Figure 5) was  applied to both the MB and FE rollover buck models to simulate the  Figure 7.

Safety / Volume 4, Issue 1 (April 2016) 155 THOR Dummy Kinematic Response Biofidelity  Benchmark To benchmark the biofidelity of the THOR dummy under rollover  condition, its kinematic responses (both the physical dummy and  numerical models) were evaluated relative to PMHS response  corridors published previously [23], using both the CORA rating  method and the BioRank rating method [32]. The CORA method consists of both the cross correlation method and  corridor method. The cross correlation method as presented above  was used to assess the similarity of dummy responses relative to the  PMHS/human average responses. However, for the corridor method,  both the PMHS/human average responses and inner/outer corridors  must be defined. The corridor method assigns a score of 1 if the  evaluated curve is within the inner corridor, a score of 0 if the  evaluated curve is out of the outer corridor, and linearly decreases  from 1 to 0 if the evaluated curve is in between the inner and outer  corridors (Figure 9). In the current analysis, the inner and outer  corridors were defined to be the average experimental response±α  standard deviation (S.D.), where α=1 for the inner corridor and α=2  Figure 8. Dummy posture 1 (Green color dummy) vs posture 2 (Blue color  dummy) for the outer corridor. Dummy Computational vs Experimental Response  Correlation Analysis To quantitatively assess the similarity of the responses of the THOR  dummy computational models relative to the physical THOR dummy,  the cross-correlation method in the CORrelation and Analysis  (CORA) method [31] was used. The cross-correlation method assigns  three values to each pair of curves compared: (1) a magnitude  coefficient, which has a value of 1.0 for identical magnitudes, and  values less than 1.0 representing one signal's magnitude as a  percentage of the other; (2) a shape coefficient, which does not have  units and can have values between 1 (same shape) and 0 (no  correlation); and lastly (3) a phase shift, which is expressed in units  of time, describing the phase shift between two signals. They are  calculated as in Table 2. Figure 9. The corridor method in CORA Table 2. Cross-Correlation Analysis Since results presented in Zhang et al.

The differences between the responses of the THOR  dummy and the PMHS were due to the much higher spinal stiffness in  the THOR dummy than in the PMHS in the lateral bending direction.  Therefore, the THOR dummy (both computational and experimental)  had much less lateral excursion than the PMHS at the superior  kinematic measurement locations (e.g. more than 150 mm at head and  50 mm at T1 for leading side occupants), while the differences at the  inferior locations were much smaller.
