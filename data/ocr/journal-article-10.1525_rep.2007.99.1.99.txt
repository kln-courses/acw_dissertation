But the idea was specific: no vague revolutionary curriculum, no pie-in-the-sky revelation or hazy, opiated dream; rather, it was a clearly articulated program of industrial and political transformation that Americans in 1890 would have known under the name of Nationalism. It was made famous by the runaway success of Edward Bellamy’s 1888 Looking Back- ward, 2000–1887: “the single most influential narrative utopia of the nine- teenth century”; third-best-selling novel of its age; and inspirer of political movements, socialist salons, and ambitious revolutionaries worldwide.2 Bel- lamy’s Nationalist utopia united the entire population of the United States in a solidarity, an “integrated consciousness,” whose precondition was the material abundance made possible by the full state regulation of the econ- omy and a general devotion to the common good.3 Under Nationalism, the absolutely even distribution of the burdens of work means that a ditch-digger need only work at his or her physically and mentally taxing job for, say, three hours a day, whereas the comparatively lighter burdens of more joyful pro- fessions (chaired professorships?) require eight hours’ daily toil. United in their mutual respect for all forms of work, Bellamy’s Americans, men and ABSTRACT Why did the coolie’s body speak so forcefully to nineteenth-century America of its fu- ture? And how did that body’s loquacious, obscene ventriloquism shape the imaginary scaffolding of America’s utopias, its science fictions? This essay answers those questions by reading Arthur Vinton’s Looking Further Backward (1890), one of the first American novels to imagine a Chinese military inva- sion of the United States. / REPRESENTATIONS 99.

The details of Nationalism’s quasi-socialist utopian International were delivered to Bellamy’s readers via a series of dialogues involving the novel’s protagonist, Julian West, who, having fallen into a hypnotic sleep in 1887, wakes up 113 years later to find his world transformed beyond recognition. His questions drive the novel’s plot, and the answers come from Dr. Leete, in whose house West wakes up after his long and improbable nap. Tacked on to Leete’s long responses to West’s bewildered questions is a fairly improbable love story, in which Julian ends up marrying Dr. Leete’s daughter, who in an astonishing coincidence turns out to be the granddaughter of West’s 1887 fi- ancée—the logic of amorous substitution providing, as Jonathan Auerbach has noted, an affective validation of “Bellamy’s entire project of systemati- cally yet invisibly bureaucratizing traditional ideologies of nationhood.”5 The failure of the Nationalist idea and the Chinese invasion to which it would lead were not, however, Bellamy’s ideas. They belonged instead to Arthur Vinton, in whose novel Looking Further Backward, published two years after its predecessor, Professor Won Lung Li makes his appearance. Set in 2023, Vinton’s novel presents the total collapse of Bellamy’s American utopia at the hands of a Chinese nation undamaged by the Nationalist race- mixing. Though Vinton’s preface declares its admiration for Bellamy’s eluci- dation of the social problems of the late 1880s—best captured in the latter’s famous image of society as a coach on which rode the wealthy, indifferent few while the impoverished and unlucky labored in harness below—Looking Further Backward attempts, as Vinton explains in the novel’s preface, “to point out wherein the Bellamy Nationalism would prove disastrously weak”: on the subject of national defense (6). As Professor Li’s remark to the fresh- man class at the fictional Shawmut College makes clear, the military weak- ness of Bellamy’s Nationalism came from a preference for grandiose ideas over pragmatic governance, utopian revolution over clear-eyed realpolitik, that the novel associates explicitly with continental Europe. But the problem Vinton’s novel posed to the American Nationalists of 1890 was bicoastal: race-mixing produced a French commitment to ideas, yes, but the material consequence of that commitment operated in another vernacular entirely. The army that made Won Lung Li a professor at Boston’s fictional Shawmut College was, after all, Chinese. 100 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="3"> REP99_05.qxd  7/10/07  11:02 M  Page 101 By the time Vinton wrote his novel, the notion of a Chinese threat to the United States was already well established in American culture. Revolving largely around the presence of Chinese workers in California, discourse de- signed to support laws that would restrict or exclude the Chinese from the United States routinely made predictions about what would happen should the Chinese be allowed unfettered entry into the country. “Before long, ev- erything we eat, touch, smell, or look at, will be the effects, either directly or indirectly, of Chinese slavery,” H. J. West claimed in the introduction to The Chinese Invasion in 1873.6 Such a sentence, appearing nearly twenty years be- fore Vinton’s novel literalized the “invasion” of West’s title, shows us the novel’s dystopia in miniature, with its fantasy of contamination given particu- lar sensory force through its attachment to a form of labor whose explicitly racial adjective marks the difference between, say, California in the 1870s and life before the American Civil War. As a response to Bellamy’s Nationalism, Vinton’s novel took part in the late-century struggle to represent (and control) the American future of in- dustrial capitalism and its forms of labor, particularly as it affected the rela- tion between individual work and concepts of production and consumption. Though nothing about Bellamy’s proposals is especially Chinese—indeed, China appears only once in Bellamy’s novel—the fact that Vinton’s response threatened a military assault from that direction suggests how closely the idea of a Chinese “invasion” was linked to the felt crisis in the nature of work and the relations of production that Bellamy’s novel attempted to resolve.7 Looking Further Backward takes up that threat and borrows much of its lan- guage, but turns it to fairly startling use, as we shall see. The Coolie’s Body Any attempt to grasp the strange, even audacious qualities of Vinton’s admittedly mediocre novel requires, first, a bit of background. For what it meant to write about China in 1890, as Won Lung Li’s lecture to his imaginary students suggests, was a sense that ideas about China were inter- twined with the concepts of labor and, thence, with the prospects of America’s relationship to the idea and possibility of modernization. The ideological keystone of that sense was the Chinese coolie, who had become already in the middle of the nineteenth century a crucial figure in the transnational response to abolitionism, largely as a putatively free replacement for the African slave whose liberation threatened the disintegration of the global economy established by the colonial and plantation nations in the Americas and the Caribbean.8 By working for lower wages than the white man would (or “could,” as we shall see), the coolie came to signify the “increasing transnationalization of Chinese Bodies, Chinese Futures 101 </page> <page sequence="4"> REP99_05.qxd  7/10/07  11:02 M  Page 102 labor markets,” Colleen Lye writes, representing “a biological impossibility and a numerical abstraction, whose social domination” threatened the disap- pearance of the “robust American body.”9 It was precisely the robustness of that body that the coolie called into question, since his body seemed by com- parison far more suited to the rigors of the industrializing age than did that of the European immigrant to the United States. It would be hard to under- estimate the obsessive insistence with which the fact of the coolie’s ability to endure low levels of constant pain was repeated, explained, and raged against in the nineteenth-century literature, where it was consistently under- stood as the racial substructure that enabled the Chinese worker to accept wages far lower than those of his Irish or German counterparts. “You cannot work a man who must have beef and bread, and would prefer beef, along- side of a man who can live on rice,” James G. Blaine told the U.S. Senate in 1879. “In all such conflicts, and in all such struggles, the result is not to bring up the man who lives on rice to the beef-and-bread standard, but it is to bring down the beef-and-bread man to the rice standard.” Cited on the last page of an American Federation of Labor (AFL) pamphlet that begins by comparing the Chinese to a tumor on the body of the American nation, Blaine’s sentence produced the document’s nutritionally focused title, Some Reasons for Chinese Exclusion. Meat versus Rice: American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism. Which Shall Survive? thereby giving Feuerbach’s gastronomic thesis of 1850, Der Mensch ist, was er ißt (Man is what he eats), an unexpectedly racial form.10 More broadly, the coolie’s ability to endure small levels of pain or con- sume only the most meager food and lodging represented an almost inhu- man adaptation to contemporary forms of modern labor. Consider Henry George, writing of Chinese workers in the New York Tribune in 1869, that “they take less earth at a spadeful than an Irishman. But in a day’s work take up more spadefuls.”11 If such an observation engendered no prideful obser- vations about Irish strength, it was because the very relation between strength and endurance was understood to be changing in favor of the latter, largely thanks to an economy defined by mass production that would natu- rally suit the physical characteristics of the Chinese. “It should be kept in mind that . . . the value of physical strength, pure and simple, has been di- minishing for more than two hundred years,” wrote James Whitney. “What gunpowder and arms of precision have done to degrade the value of physi- cal prowess in war, improvements in implements and machinery have done to debase the value of physical strength in the arts and industries, and the Chinaman is equal to all the demands, whether of peace or war, of civilized or barbaric existence.”12 Hence the image on the frontispiece of the AFL’s pamphlet in 1902, “The American Gulliver and the Chinese Lilliputians,” 102 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="5"> REP99_05.qxd  7/10/07  11:02 M  Page 103 which shows a white laborer pinned to the ground by banners reading “cheap labor,” “heathen competition,” and “starvation wages” as an endless stream of tiny Chinese workers flows toward and over him. In this image as in the culture at large, the threatened triumph of the coolie presaged a vic- tory of quantity over quality, of consistent small efforts over heroic large ones, of the faceless mass over the individual, and of mass production over unalienated, organic labor. This is why the Chinese were so often compared to insects, and why “the white laborer who would compete with them . . . must, like them, abdicate his individuality.”13 The mechanical, automatic, and enduring qualities of the Chinese were explicitly tied to sociological theories of Chinese culture produced by Amer- ican missionaries. An “absence of nerves,” remarkable “staying qualities,” and a “capacity to wait without complaint and to bear with calm endurance,” were all features of Chinese people in general described by Arthur Smith in his 1894 Chinese Characteristics, the most widely read American work on China in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.14 Taken as the substructural foundation of the economic questions he raised, and thus per- ceived as prior to the particular threat Chinese labor posed on the American West Coast, the coolie’s biologically impossible body was the displaced ground for an awareness of the transformation of the laboring body into a machine. The coolie thus represented the possibility of a new human era marked specifically by its Chineseness, since his ability to endure (in work and in life) permitted him “to write all day like an automaton” without suc- cumbing to exhaustion or boredom. “If he is a handicraftsman he will stand in one place from dewy morn till dusky eve,” Smith wrote, “and do it every day without any variation in the monotony, and apparently with no special consciousness that there is any monotony to be varied” (CC, 92). This last phrase is crucial for understanding the quasi-sociological position from which Smith spoke, because it suggests not that the Chinese feels monotony like the American, and simply deals with it better, but that the Chinese worker does not experience monotony or repetition in the first place. Framed as a “lack of consciousness” of what to Smith must have seemed a well-nigh objective state of affairs, the Chinese difference is thus located not in the in- dividual body but in the racial-cultural situation that produces it. The Chi- nese subject Smith imagined could no more awaken to his own privation or boredom than an animal could to human language.15 In framing Chinese exclusion as a choice between “American manhood” and “Asiatic coolieism,” the AFL pamphlet voiced a common concern among anti-Chinese activists: that the gradual replacement of workers of European descent by Chinese laborers would result in the Chinese-ification of American life. The final fear was that we (Americans) would all become Chinese Bodies, Chinese Futures 103 </page> <page sequence="6"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 104 coolies. Though writer after writer was willing to insist that at the individual level such a transformation was improbable—that, as Blaine suggested, you simply can’t feed a man on rice if he needs beef—the battle against Chinese exclusion was nonetheless understood as a more general battle against mod- ernization itself, and indeed against the new forms of human consciousness demanded by the age. Hence, Smith: “To the Anglo-Saxon race, at least, it seems a matter of course that those who live in an age of steam and of elec- tricity must necessarily be in a different condition, as to their nerves, from those who lived in the old slow days of sailing-packets and of mail-coaches. Ours is an age of extreme activity. It is an age of rush . . . The effect of over- working our nerves shows itself not mainly in such affectations as ‘fiddler’s cramp,’ ‘telegrapher’s cramp,’ ‘writer’s cramp,’ and the like, but in a general tension” (CC, 90–91). Though Smith wants to dissociate the “general ten- sion” of a nervous modernity from the job-specific illnesses he refers to, it is nonetheless telling that each of these “cramps” is a repetitive stress injury caused by the replication of small, individually insignificant gestures, as though the general tension of the times were the result not of any single event or momentary crisis but of the daily, unceasing, worrisome and mor- bid reiterations of the new modern life—the difference between strength and endurance allegorized in the form of capitalist progress. It is only a page later that Smith marvels at the Chinese worker’s ability to “write all day like an automaton” (CC, 92). So it was that the Chinese body could figure the West’s potentially “Chinese” future, as though somewhere in the particular embodied qualities of the Chinese—which included, as Yellow Perilist discourse made clear throughout the period, the fact of their sheer number—lay the obscured and secret fulcrum of the future to come. Angle the lever one way, and you got the return to mass slavery and oligarchic despotism presaged by Chinese labor in the United States; push the burden from the other side, as optimists and missionaries dreamed, and it was the Chinese who would be trans- formed, ushering in an age of universal Christian sympathy. This latter, much-desired shift would not come easily, Smith thought. The “character and conscience” that had taken the West a thousand years to develop could not just “be suddenly taken up by the Chinese for their own, and set in oper- ation, like a Krupp gun from Essen, mounted and ready to be discharged” (CC, 329). Though the comparison between culture and the Krupp gun distin- guishes the former’s artisanal mode from the latter’s mass production, the fact that the latter is also a weapon recalls Whitney’s anxieties about what “gunpowder and arms of precision have done to degrade the value of physi- cal prowess in war,” degrade being the privileged term for describing what Chinese labor would do to white labor in the United States. The military 104 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="7"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 105 framing of these two metaphors hints at an underlying anxiety that Whitney, at least, was willing to make explicit: “China is stronger on the Pacific Coast in men capable of bearing arms than ourselves, and . . . she can transport ten warriors from the middle of the kingdom to San Francisco at less ex- pense than the United States can convey a single soldier and his knapsack from Chicago to the Coast; . . . she can send vessels with stronger armor and heavier guns to breach the walls of Alcatraz than we could provide for de- fense, and could send them in a shorter time.”16 Whitney thus clarifies the stakes of “the Chinese question” by literalizing the threat of a Chinese future in martial terms. It would be foolish to say that this military angle—present also, though less directly, in Smith’s comparison between culture and a Krupp gun—reveals the final truth about anti-Chinese agitation on America’s West Coast, which would then turn out to have been about national war- mongering all along. But it makes sense to understand the articulation, how- ever metaphorical, of a Chinese military threat as yet another dimension of larger concerns about the Chinese “invasion” of the United States via immi- gration, or in relation to Daniel Webster’s 1850 reference to California’s landscape as being “Asiatic, in . . . formation and scenery,” that is, as expres- sions of anxiety about European sovereignty over the American territory, and, more pressingly, about the sovereignty of an idealized, monocultural, and artisanal past over a multiracial, mass-produced future embedded in both the body of the Chinese worker and the very landscape of the national territory.17 Not for nothing did Edward Bellamy’s Nationalist America enlist everyone in what the novel referred to as an “industrial army,” and not for nothing did that army fall, in Vinton’s Looking Further Backward, to the much more actual army of the Chinese. That Dystopian Feeling Were Vinton’s novel organized around the prospect of a horde of numberless, faceless Chinese pouring over American borders and blud- geoning a valiant nation into submission by degrees, it would be the sim- plest reflection of the racial politics of its era. Such representations were characteristic of several other Chinese invasion novels published in those years, including Pierton W. Dooner’s Last Days of the Republic (1880), Robert Woltor’s A Short and Truthful History of the Taking of Oregon and California by the Chinese in the Year A.D. 1899 (1882), and a number of short stories pub- lished in the Overland Monthly. These stories tend to combine immigrant in- surgencies with foreign military action and feature Chinese armies indiffer- ent to their own casualties and more generally characterized by, as Woltor put it, “a stoic indifference to pain, which makes them fearless to deeds of blood, and a certain coolness in moments of excitement and danger, when Chinese Bodies, Chinese Futures 105 </page> <page sequence="8"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 106 calmness is invaluable”—the two sides of endurance and monotony already established as features of the coolie.18 Such narratives leavened American defeat with tales of Chinese cowardice, cruelty, and poor character, pitting the venality of the invaders against an American populace too trusting of foreigners, and they were punctuated here and there by a doomed, authen- tic hero whose efforts would have clarified the need for a breed of Ameri- can ideologically and militarily equipped to resist future foreign invasion. Had Vinton followed the stock formula, the reinscription of the logic of in- dividual, craft labor in the body of the singular, individuated protagonist would have allowed him to clarify once again, with the indefatigable monotony of racist discourse, the value of manual labor over factory work, manhood over coolieism, and—looking ahead to another military conflict between Asia and the West—Rambos over Rimbauds. But Looking Further Backward is not that story. Indeed, despite Professor Li’s remarks about the American capitulation to European revolutionary idealism, Looking Further Backward is largely a novel of ideas, not a plan of ac- tion or an industrial program. Rather than translating the Chinese threat into pseudo-gothic narrative forms designed to rouse readerly emotions by their depictions of hand-to-hand combat and torture (as would the British novelist M.P. Shiel in an 1898 series of short stories collected as The Yellow Danger),19 Vinton presents a future almost entirely without drama or sus- pense, generating its content entirely out of Li’s lectures to his Shawmut Col- lege students and excerpts from diaries written by Julian West and his son Leete. Ironically, the novel’s preference for mushy ideas over muscular narra- tive seems to enact the very flaw that Won Lung Li identifies at the heart of the American love of Nationalism in the first place. Though in Vinton’s case the responsibility for this love of ideas can hardly be placed on race- mixing and a love of immigration, it is fairly remarkable that his novel, written at a time when popular discourse on China and the Chinese was filled with dramatic stories, poetic figures, exaggerations, predictions, character portraits, startlingly vivid metaphors of violence, illness, and dis- ease, and all manner of detailed cultural anecdote and illustration, could simply pass these forms and figures by. Some blame for this can be laid at Bellamy’s feet, since his relatively plotless vision of an American utopia was the best-selling fiction of the decade. But that alone does not explain to what purpose or effect a novel that so perfectly captured the general ideo- logical matrix of the American discourse on China managed to avoid prac- tically every other figurative habit and narrative structure associated with the language from which it drew. In what follows I read the novel’s arrangement of stereotype and form as the kelson of its structure of feeling, the crucial feature of its narrative form 106 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="9"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 107 and of what might be called its theory of futurity. The argument of Looking Further Backward develops in the tension between its largely backward-looking diegesis—which tells the story of an invasion that has already happened, generated entirely through Professor Li—and the metadiegetic, proairetic sequences that appear in the Wests’ diaries.20 Though neither of these modes is especially dramatic, the differences between them are responsi- ble for the novel’s ultimately transcultural take on the relationship be- tween China and the United States, and particularly for its consistent re- versals of the standard features of the Asiatic stereotype. The few scholars who have discussed Vinton have read his novel largely in terms of the his- tory of American utopianism, in which it has a relatively minor and unin- teresting place.21 Considered in terms of the politics and history of the American relation to China, and more particularly as a rethinking of the cultural relationship between Chineseness, suffering, and modernity, how- ever, the novel becomes substantially more compelling, since from this per- spective its racist, dystopian take on the American present makes visible, if only in its negative space, a postracial, bicultural, and fully utopian future. The novel cannot, however, represent this future; it can only indicate it. This mimetic impasse defines the novel’s production of readerly affect, as we shall see. Let us begin with the novel’s content. Its references to the nineteenth- century Asiatic stereotype operate largely in the mode of reversal. Julian West writes, for instance, that the Chinese officers he meets are “men of high breeding and great intellectual attainments” whose “polished manners and skill in conversation . . . would have made them charming hosts, under dif- ferent circumstances” (144). And Leete’s rescue of his fiancée from occu- pied Boston is accomplished with the help of a number of Chinese officials, who arrange to hide her and her family aboard a railway car heading west. Their kindness, Professor Li tells his students, demonstrates “that the Chi- nese officers, to whom was confided the task of conquering, had tender and sympathetic hearts” (176). Though it has been the fashion, Li notes, to “abuse the Chinese, to call them devils, monsters, and ogres, and to impute to them horrible and diabolical motives,” the truth is that they “shed many tears over the suffering of the captive nation” (176).  Other reversals are equally minor: discussing the Chinese-managed French revolution, Li notes that France has become “practically a depen- dency of China, and annually paid to China a tribute of many million taels” (24).22 Some undo the idea of the Chinese body as a machine: on a number of occasions, the degree to which the totalitarian organization of Bellamyite Nationalism had removed from Americans any sense of independence or initiative leads both Li and West to compare them to automata. Li speaks of a general “loss of individualism” (28), and writes that “under Nationalism Chinese Bodies, Chinese Futures 107 </page> <page sequence="10"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 108 men had become mere routinists—theorists following a beaten track and blind to all things outside it” (93). West notes the “mechanical” obedience of the Americans to the orders of the occupying army, blaming it on a “destruc- tion of individualism” (72–73) and, most tellingly, says that “under the Na- tionalistic system each man’s duty was so exactly defined, that to go beyond its limits was treason, and though men had not yet been by it degraded into absolute machines, they had been brought near enough to that point to permit almost any unforeseen circumstance to cause a far-reaching de- rangement of the governmental system” (109–10). West’s “degraded” ties the critique of Nationalism most explicitly to the labor politics of the 1890s, referring simultaneously to the general threat posed to individual labor by factory work and to the specific threat of degradation posed by the Chinese worker as a proxy for industrial modernization. But the novel’s most terrifying and dystopian inversion comes in the Americans’ subjection to a reverse middle passage fully comparable to the one endured by Chinese coolies or African slaves. Following its invasion, the Chi- nese army begins importing Chinese citizens to the United States and ex- porting Americans to Europe and China. “The swift Atlantic passenger and freight steamers were continually plying to and fro between France and America, bearing hither Chinese and French soldiers and artisans, and car- rying to France an equal number of the flower of American young men,” Li says. “Within six months after the declaration of war the whole eastern coast of the United States, for an average of one hundred miles inland had more Chinese subjects than native born Americans; while in the Pacific States, owing to their greater nearness to China, there were thrice as many Chinese as Americans” (85). The “necessarily overcrowded” ships on which the man- acled Americans traveled produced disease that decimated their numbers, Li reminds his students. But those who lived to see France or China were not much better off: “sold at private sale and public auction as laborers to whoso- ever would hire them, they became practically slaves. The mortality among them is frightful to contemplate, but we may well doubt if those who died were not more fortunate than those whose existence continued for a longer term of years” (86). When Looking Further Backward addresses the American relationship to Chinese racial form, then, it does so almost entirely by inverting that rela- tionship’s historical and stereotypical terms, so that the French (not the Chi- nese) pay indemnities, the Chinese (not the Americans) benefit from inno- vation and advances in military technology, and the Americans (not the Chinese) mechanically acquiesce to their subjection and are forcibly sold into slavery. The novel retains the historical “diction” of the relation be- tween East and West while inverting its “grammar”: subjects become objects, with dramatically dystopian results. The uncanny effect of this defamiliarization 108 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="11"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 109 allows the novel’s referential work to vibrate continuously between the pre- sent from which it emerges and the future to which it refers. The novel’s reversals at the level of content can be connected to the nar- rative refusals of its form if we imagine that Vinton’s dystopia becomes all the more powerful or frightening for having its story so calmly told. The fact that the novel is a series of lectures presents the invasion as a fait accompli, and the absence of the racially hysterical language and form of the late nine- teenth century testifies to this accomplishment as fully as any singular fea- ture of the novel’s content. Li seems to recognize this in his opening lecture. Speaking to an audi- ence of pacified college students three years after the invasion, he remarks that the facts of the matter are by now fairly well known. What is not under- stood, he says, are not events but causes: “I would impress upon your minds now, at the outset of our historical studies, the importance of seeking for the causes, that led in the past to these social changes which have marked the rise or decadence of nations; and especially of those causes which immediately re- sulted in the fall of the Nationalistic system of government” (18). Here again we see the novel’s commitment to ideas over emplotment, a promise to de- liver a set of sociological and political explanations that will resemble in every way the long explanatory monologues of Bellamy’s Looking Backward. Just as Bellamy’s novel wound up spicing up its policy discussions with an impossibly absurd romance plot, however, so Vinton’s response cannot quite seem to get the thrill of narrative off its mind. Despite Li’s assertions about the importance of causes, as the novel progresses its lectures are increasingly taken over by excerpts from the West diaries, whose force comes from their narrating from an individual, lived perspective the experience of the Chi- nese invasion. Already in the first lecture Li cites from Julian West, giving him three of the discussion’s ten pages. The second lecture contains five, and the third fully fifteen pages of citation from West’s diaries, and the fifth, tenth, and eleventh lectures are entirely given over to him (and include a brief citation from Bellamy’s book, among Vinton’s invented diary-work).23 Lectures twelve and thirteen are made up almost entirely of citations from Leete West’s journals. All in all, more than half of the total volume of the fourteen lectures in the book, and thus more than half of Li’s work for the 2023 school year (that is, roughly 100 pages of a 179-page novel) are given over to the Wests’ journals, including fully two-thirds of the lectures in the book’s second half (about 69 of the last 100 pages).  The differences between these two modes of narration permit a reading of the novel as at least partly about a conflict in the mechanics of literary form. Consider the differences between these two citations, the first from Professor Li, the second from Leete West: Chinese Bodies, Chinese Futures 109 </page> <page sequence="12"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 110 No idea that they were to be deported had entered the heads of the drafted men on the Common when they were formed in lines and the roll of their names was called; but when the armorers of the war vessels appeared and carts containing chains and shackles were driven up, something of the truth became apparent. The lines wa- vered, then broke into disorder, and the attempt of the armorers to manacle those nearest to them, resulted in a rush that drove them back. Some such resistance was expected by the Chinese commanders, and the Common had been surrounded by a strong cordon of troops. These now advanced with fixed bayonets until the rioters were huddled in a disorganized, indignant, and terrified mass at one end of the Com- mon. The bolder spirits among the Americans wrenched off the branches of the trees, and using them as clubs endeavored by a sudden rush to break through the ranks of the military. It was at this point that the word “fire” was given, and a murder- ous discharge was poured into the mass of unarmed, helpless rioters. (101–2) She gave me a very graphic account of poor Jack Storiot’s death. He was one of those who had been assembled on the Common for deportation, and one of the first whom it had been attempted to manacle. We all knew Jack’s high spirit and im- petuosity, and I have no doubt that this insult of the Chinese threw him into a great passion. He was one of the first to attack the Chinese and fell most horribly muti- lated. Margaretta told me that one of the papers had published a list of those who had been killed or wounded in this horrible massacre. The paper had been sup- pressed by the Chinese as soon as it appeared, but the Nesmyths had fortunately been able to secure a copy, and this she now brought to me. As I read over the list of names I saw many that I knew; fortunately my intimate friends had not been there, but Tom Hammond, Lafayette Brett, Babcock Tyler and Will Peckham were among the killed, and Aleck Warner, Charlie Bell and several other old school friends were among the wounded. It was an awful thing. I spoke of it that evening to Commissioner Hi and he told me that no one could regret it more than the Chi- nese did. It was one of the terrible results of war, to be excused only by its necessity. “We have hearts,” he said, “but we must do our duty.” (153–54) The same event described from two perspectives: the first includes no names, no individual characterizations, and no dialogue and conceals its ac- tivity under a string of passive constructions (four in the first sentence alone) of which the most crucial appear in the final sentence, when the word “fire” is “given” and the discharge is “poured,” in each case by no one in particular, into the bodies of the rioters. The second is framed as dia- logue and includes another one (Margaretta gives Leete the account, Leete talks to Commissioner Hi); it contains an individual characterization of one of the rioters, particular names and details, an emotional reaction to the sit- uation (“It was an awful thing”), and a discussion of its value. Most impor- tant, Leete’s discussion of the newspaper list of those killed, in drawing at- tention to the spread of information, shows how the story one tells about an event depends on its circulation and distribution inside a social field. Li’s lecture, on the other hand, takes that social field for granted—or rather, it constitutes the dominant social field within which the narrative circulates (like the Chinese in 2020, it suppresses the names of those involved).  110 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="13"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 111 If one allows the difference between these two descriptions of the Boston massacre to stand in for the more general difference between the mode of narration that appears in Li’s lectures and the one that organizes the diaries, one sees how the novel organizes itself around two different types of narra- tion, each of which is associated with a particular type of narrator (a Chinese professor/two members of the American resistance), a particular temporal- ity (2023/2020), and a formal relationship to novelistic discourse (diegesis/ metadiegesis). The former is self-consciously aligned with an emphasis on historical causality largely disconnected from individual actors and commu- nicates narrative information in general statements characterized by passive or expletive constructions (for instance: “There was, however, much suffer- ing among those whose flight had exhausted their credit cards” [124]). The latter relies on forms of proairetic emplotment and characterological detail that much more closely resemble those of the traditional novel. One way to think about the novel, then, is as the product of a formal conflict between two modes of storytelling. The first, Li’s, is primarily indica- tive, the second primarily mimetic; the first “tells,” the second “shows.” Be- cause the novel begins and ends with Li’s voice, and because he reads the di- ary sections aloud, these two modes are arranged in a hierarchy in which the invariably analeptic diary sections appear under the aegis of the lectures’ present-tense narration. And yet the hierarchy established by the purely for- mal positioning of the narrative modes in the novel is undermined by the fact of the novel’s increasing commitment to the metadiegetic diaries, which practically overwhelm the lectures by the end of the book. The formal impasse produced by this conflict must be thought, finally, beyond form, as a motivated effect of the novel’s character-space. The en- tire formal conflict established by the movement between the diaries’ rep- resentational mode and the lectures’ indicative one happens, after all, at the instigation of Won Lung Li. It is he who chooses to read the diaries to his class and who in so doing fills in the relatively bloodless narration of the Boston massacre with details about Leete’s friend Jack and the sup- pression of the news by the Chinese, he who gives over nearly two-thirds of his diegetic space to the voice of two members of the American resistance. This suggests that the novel itself can be rethought not as a story of the Chinese invasion, but as a representation of a year in the life of its narra- tor, whose protagonism elaborates itself purely as a formal effect. The con- flict between narrative modes must therefore be understood as Won Lung Li’s personal struggle with two competing modes of narration, the first his expressed and conscious preference, the second his unconscious, expres- sive one. The narrative space (measured in pages) the novel accords to each of these two narrative modes indicates, then, both a formal conflict and the effect of the development of Li’s character over the course of the Chinese Bodies, Chinese Futures 111 </page> <page sequence="14"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 112 book—form is, indeed, the only line along which Li’s character can be said to develop at all.24 If the narrative mode that gradually takes over the novel is explicitly marked as both representational and American, then Li’s increasingly citational lectures must be understood at least partly as personal accom- modations of an American style that does not—at least at the novel’s opening—seem to be his preferred narrative mode. His description of the “Chinafication” of the United States (176) is thus matched by an “American- ification” of his own speech, a gradual slide from lectures that refer to or indicate the history to diaries that privilege the limited, individualistic expe- rience of that lived history over a structural explanation of “causes” and their “results” (17).25 From this perspective, the novel is “about” not only the Chinese invasion of the United States but also an individual intercultural ex- perience in which a member of the invading culture transforms himself (or is transformed) by narrating the history of the invasion of which he is a member. Rather than a monodirectional tale of invasion and conversion, then, the novel represents the mutual (and largely unconscious) imbrication of the colonizer with the colonized, the Chinese with the American, and the immediate present with the recent past. Though the terms of that imbrica- tion are hardly equal—at novel’s end, Li remains a history professor, while Julian West has been killed in combat—they nonetheless complicate a sense of the novel’s temporal structure. Looking Further Backward’s primary narra- tive element remains, to be sure, the Chinese invasion. But the novel proper opens some three years after that, in a diegetic present to which Li’s narrato- logical shifts consistently recall us, so that his story continuously shadows the more spectacular one whose story he tells. A measure of the transformation urged upon Li’s audience by his for- mally generated story appears in a crucial shift in his use of pronouns. The year’s first lecture opens as follows:  I come before you as a stranger. I am born of a race that the race you are born of has for centuries been trained to think of as an inferior race. (10) This “you” serves a double function. Motivated internally by the students to whom he lectures, it also addresses the novel’s 1890 readership. In fact, the “you” makes more sense as a reference to nineteenth-century readers, since by 2023 the students at Shawmut would have had three years to unlearn the idea of Chinese racial inferiority and adjust to the fact that half the popula- tion of Boston was of Chinese origin. Li’s “you,” retained throughout the novel, thus continually addresses and implicates the 1890 reader in a system of racial prejudice that the story’s progress severely tests. Though it is per- haps not fair to say that the novel is narrated in the second person, the re- lentless appearance of the second-person plural, by confusing the novel’s 112 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="15"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 113 real addressees with its fictional ones, implicates readers in a pedagogical structure of address that subordinates them to, and separates them from, the text’s primary narrative voice. All this changes in the final lecture. Li opens the discussion by noting that “it is with regret that I cease to quote from Professor West’s diary,” be- fore announcing that “what I have to say to you to-day, in this, the closing lec- ture of your freshman year, will be expressed to you in my own words” (177).26 Given what I have described as the conflict between narrative modes, Li’s claim about his “own words” appears to be the final salvo in a for- mal war, a bold recapturing of his voice and a declaration of his indepen- dence from West’s work and his form of narrative. Indeed, the pages that fol- low occur entirely in Li’s preferred indicative mode and give a brief sketch of the course of the Chinese takeover of the United States, distinguishing sharply between the second person and the first: “At the time that I speak to you, the Nationalists are hemmed in on all sides, save on the frozen north, from communication with outside nations. The front line of our armies forms a semi-circle stretching from Montreal south along the western base of the Alleghenies to the Ohio” (186–87, my emphases). And then we come to the novel’s final two paragraphs: Let us now, in closing, consider hastily the benefits which the invasion of the Chi- nese has brought to us. We are no longer a defenseless people, ready to be subjugated by the first armed nation that attacks. Our material prosperity was never greater. Our soil sup- ports a greater population than it did before. Chinese frugality has replaced the wasteful lavishness that prevailed in private life under the Nationalistic govern- ment. Woman no longer competes with man, but has become as the Gods intended she should be, the handmaiden of male humanity. What was good in Nationalism we have retained. What was bad we have discarded and replaced by what is better. Under Nationalism, individualism was reduced to a minimum; with us to-day it is honored and given every chance to develop. (187–88) The first “us” is rhetorical. The second one, at the end of the first sentence, arguably refers only to the Chinese. But beginning with the “we” of the sec- ond paragraph, Li’s pronouns point unmistakably to the new population of the United States, conceiving himself and the students for the first time as members of a single group. The grammatical unity supposes a po- litical one; the transformation of Li’s first-person singular into the plural thus signals the possibility of a new political subjectivity whose form of gov- ernment is neither purely Chinese nor purely Nationalist, but a mixture of both. Because, as I’ve suggested, Li’s continual use of “you” determines much of the novel’s fictional relationship to its doubled audience (students and reader), the shift to “we” signals more than a simple call to patriotism. Chinese Bodies, Chinese Futures 113 </page> <page sequence="16"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 114 It invites the reader, within the formal terms already privileged by the novel, to take on the burden of a truly utopian, quasi-socialist citizenship in which the positive aspects of Bellamyite Nationalism—mainly the end of class warfare and the abolition of the gap between rich and poor—are retained and leavened with a good dose of individualism (and, not inci- dentally, of sexism).27 Never represented, only indicated, the biracial, bi- cultural utopia to which Li refers in the novel’s final paragraphs appears most visibly in the formal shift from “you” to “we,” where the novel’s nar- rator and its audience, separated since the beginning of the novel, are fi- nally drawn together. For readers who breathed a sigh of relief at individ- ualism’s restoration, or smiled at women’s return to their proper place, the consequences of the Chinese invasion reveal themselves to be restora- tive of American values lost in the move to Nationalism. If the novel is se- rious in this moment—that is, if this is not simply an injunction to an ever more dystopian take on Americanness, now fully merged with the Chi- nese—then the affective and political resolution it represents, however clumsily, results from its narrative trajectory from the second-person plu- ral to the first. The emotional conflict of the earlier part of the novel would have to be understood, in such a reading, as a metadiegetic effect within this happier diegesis.  The awkward balance of these two emotional modes, which together comprise the novel’s total structure of feeling, parallels the position of Vinton’s novel within the larger discourse on China of his time. For nine- teenth-century progressives and union activists, the mechanization of labor proceeded through its “Chinafication,” with American individualism (and its beefy manhood) under attack by forms of factory work especially suited to Chinese bodies and their biological impossibilities. In Vinton, however, it is the Chinese who save the misguided American socialists from themselves, since Bellamy’s utopian distribution of the burden of labor produces pre- cisely the kind of mechanized, docile population that union activists feared would result from widespread proletarianization in the first place. This is at some level not surprising; “the enemies of Utopia sooner or later turn out to be the enemies of socialism.”28 But Vinton’s detournenment of the Chinese position in American racial politics did more than discredit socialism; by so obviously reversing the rhetorical function of the Chinese, Vinton’s novel re- vealed how malleable the Chinese were as a figure for American futurity. And in turning them to this particular use—in imagining them, that is, as the historical preservers of individualism—Vinton also made the Chinese the best Americans of all: cultured, civilized, capable of ordering a massacre and of weeping at its unhappy results, the novel’s Chinese figure a relation to modernity that is simultaneously sympathetic and productive, compas- sionate and mercenary. The novel thus turns the idea of Chinese stasis and 114 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="17"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 115 stagnation, so common a part of the nineteenth-century stereotype, into a beneficial trait. It is precisely by not changing that China returns to the West—if only through the barrel of a gun—the values the latter left be- hind in its progressive, future-oriented, and suspiciously European fervor for ideas. We have seen how consistently the novel reverses the stereotypes its era gave it. And we have seen how the novel’s displacement of characterological development from content to narrative form allows it to present two stories simultaneously, first the Chinese invasion, and second, the formally coded, narrative transformation of one member of the invading culture. This per- sonal change effectively allegorizes the national transformation referred to in the novel’s final two paragraphs, with Li’s final use of “we” testifying gram- matically to the political compromise already established by the Chinese army.29 If we consider what these three gestures have in common, we can de- velop a total theory of Looking Further Backward as a text that consistently pro- duces its most important meanings by articulating in one narratological field a meaning that belongs most properly to another. One sees this pareleptic tendency clearest in the novel’s production of Li’s characterological devel- opment—which, since it involves character, “should” be articulated in the content—exclusively at the level of form. But it appears also in the reversals of the Asiatic stereotype, which consistently displace and defamiliarize con- temporary cultural formations by shifting their national origin or moral value. And it occurs, finally, in the novel’s grammatical articulation of what is, after all, primarily a political conclusion, so that the question of civic rep- resentation gets resolved not in the diegetic arena (through something like a description of the new Chinese-Americans responding happily to their sit- uation) but by a pronominal switch whose field of reference reaches beyond the diegesis. It is with the status of the nineteenth-century readers touched by Li’s ag- gressive plural pronoun that I wish to close this discussion. Rereading the novel, I found myself wondering what their emotional, identificatory experi- ence could have been. Assuming they took its story seriously—as seriously, that is, as it takes itself—readers of Looking Further Backward would have spent most of their time feeling slightly nauseated, I imagined, since the novel con- fronts them so starkly with the failure of a nation and a utopia with which they surely identified. Interpellated from the novel’s very first words by a “you” that lumped them together with a defeated, subjected people, forced to listen to a humiliating account of their nation’s future history, carried through the story of a massacre on the Boston Common and a description of white Americans sold into slavery, readers presumably spent much of their time in a state of anxiety or paranoia or even, to add one more “ugly Chinese Bodies, Chinese Futures 115 </page> <page sequence="18"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 116 feeling” to Sianne Ngai’s list, intense despair.30 What must they have thought, then, upon reading the novel’s final two paragraphs? Speaking theoretically, one has every right to imagine that the grammatical and thematic weight of those paragraphs supersedes the work of the rest of the book. But those paragraphs not only asked readers to revise the meaning and value of the novel’s fictionalized history; they also required them to remake the entire af- fective experience of their reading. Having spent the first 178 pages of the novel feeling badly about the American setbacks, or identifying with West’s frustrated attempts to prompt the machinelike Nationalists to react appro- priately to invasion, such readers could be forgiven for feeling that this switch appeared too late to be easily believed, or borne. If, as Raymond Williams has suggested, novels are useful because they can establish in advance of politics a “structure of feeling” that provides readers with an emotional and/or experiential framework through which to grasp material transformations in their worlds—if, that is, novels express, sometimes unconsciously, new apprehensions of the present into which they continually emerge—then whatever emotional work Vinton’s novel does be- longs to a complex structure of feeling indeed.31 For such a structure must include, if it is to be complete, both the generally dystopian, bleak events of most of the novel, with all their startling inversions and threats about the military weaknesses of socialism, and the final two paragraphs, which promise a militarily robust, individually oriented, quasi-utopian America that differs from the United States of 1890 in having become at least partly socialist: Nationalism with Chinese-American characteristics. What the novel gives readers to grasp, that is, is an emotional complex that recognizes the limitations of the present—Vinton writes in the preface that “the existence of great private fortunes is a menace to the welfare of the State” (6)—and then punishes readers for believing in Bellamy’s utopian resolution to those limitations by forcing them through the emotionally difficult loss of his Na- tionalist solution. The suffering of the novel’s Americans, like the frustration of the Wests at the mechanically slow response of the Nationalists to inva- sion, is intended to make the reader suffer as well: in fact one might say that the novel’s “argument” against Bellamy occurs largely on the basis of the emotional “evidence” provided by the identificatory suffering it causes. That the novel finally offers the reader a “happy” ending suggests that it aims to force the reader to pass through that suffering into a contended and sympa- thetic recognition of its necessity—that in fact the work of the novel is to produce through affective identification a recognition of the necessity of affective identification itself. This, I wish to argue, is the novel’s most stunning paralepsis. In forcing the American reader to endure a transformative suffering, by redeeming that suffering through the literary mechanism of the Chinese army, the 116 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="19"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 117 novel encodes but does not represent the relationship between endurance and la- bor that drove the nineteenth-century Asiatic stereotype. The coolie is in fact never seen in the novel; only in the least embodied, most moral-philosophical ways does the question of a “Chinese” relation to suffering appear in Looking Further Backward at all (in Li’s descriptions of the weeping officers, for in- stance). But suffering occurs—displaced, as with the novel’s narrative or its political union, into another register—at the level of the reader’s experience of the dystopia. And this suffering is the result of the adoption, in the diege- sis, of a form of labor designed to eliminate suffering from labor: it is because the Americans implement Bellamyite Nationalism that they eventually must be killed in Boston and New York or sold into slavery abroad. Suffering re- turns to the United States as the price of individualism, both diegetically and in the experience of reading, where the reader is punished for dreaming of utopia and rewarded, however belatedly, for giving up that dream in favor of a new political union that recognizes suffering as a necessary aspect of the transformation of human life. Talal Asad has referred to the process whereby imperial powers imposed their beliefs about physical pain on the countries they colonized as “humaniz- ing the world,” a program whose elimination in various colonial contexts of “customs the European rulers considered cruel” derived not from a desire to put an end to indigenous suffering but rather from “the desire to impose what [colonizers] considered civilized standards of justice and humanity on a subject population—that is, the desire to create new human subjects.” In the process of “learning to be ‘fully human,’” Asad writes, “only some kinds of suffering were seen as an affront to humanity, and their elimination sought. This was distinguished from suffering that was necessary to the process of re- alizing one’s humanity—that is, pain that was adequate to its end, not waste- ful pain.”32 What Vinton’s novel suggests, however, is that the humanization of the world and the recognition of the values of “necessary” suffering were values that had to be communicated to (if not imposed on) Western popula- tions as well. For it is clearly the message of Looking Further Backward that cer- tain kinds of suffering must be endured, and that the violent necessity of even something like a middle passage might, with enough perspective, be ac- cepted as a regrettable side effect of the production of a freer world. If the novel has a structure of feeling, it is one that establishes through the manipu- lations of its formal and thematic properties the “truth” of this new system, in which the suffering of slavery and murder might be accepted as the necessary price for a politico-economic structure that could accommodate the necessi- ties of modern labor while retaining a respect for individualism. The fact that the novel never portrays the results of its utopian program—the only hint of its presence comes in Li’s final paragraphs—suggests how difficult it must have been to actually imagine. It functions, unrepresented, more as the Chinese Bodies, Chinese Futures 117 </page> <page sequence="20"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 118 novel’s dream than as its fulfilled wish; indeed one of the ironies of the novel is that the entire invasion has to happen, and Li must go through an elabo- rate ballet around narrative form, only to get to the point where such a sys- tem can be referred to, if not exactly imagined into being. Learning to Lose Though Looking Further Backward is the one of the first American science fictions to imagine a Chinese military invasion of the United States, it cannot be said to have established any particular rules for the genre. The novels that succeeded it work much more successfully with the Asiatic stereotype than Vinton ever did, borrowing liberally from notions of Chi- nese cruelty (as did Sax Rohmer’s thirteen novels on Fu Manchu, “the yellow peril incarnate in one man,” published between 1913 and 1959) or casually remarking of China, as does a Japanese-American CIA agent in a 2001 Tom Clancy novel, that “some of the world’s most vicious tortures had been invented in this country, where the value of human life was a far less important thing than in the nation of his origin.”33 Whatever pride of place Looking Further Backward has in the pantheon of paranoid, anti-Chinese American science fiction must lie, therefore, in the fact that it neither fol- lowed the models that preceded nor inspired the works that followed it, in the fact, that is, that its imagination of the future was so uncompelling as to allow it—along with Vinton’s literary career more generally—to disappear without leaving much of a mark on even that small subsection of American literary history to which it belongs. Perhaps this failure comes down to the novel’s handling of its pseudo-utopian finish, whose attempt to remake the emotional tenor of the book happens too late, and too clumsily, to be liter- arily successful or emotionally compelling. By contrast, Ignatius Donnelly’s Caesar’s Column, published a year after Looking Further Backward and featuring a successful American worker’s revolt (set in 1988) against an Orientalized, cosmopolitan oligarchy, sold 60,000 copies in its first year alone (and ap- peared in German translation three years later): clearly a formula that struck a chord with its readers in a way that Vinton’s did not.34 Vinton’s failure to pick up on the stock formulae of anti-Chinese fiction may be at least partially explained by his location within the United States. Unlike Dooner’s Last Days of the Republic or Woltor’s A Short and Truthful His- tory of the Taking of Oregon and California, both of which were published in San Francisco and surely found there a white reading audience well acquainted with the coolie stereotype and attuned to anxieties about Chinese labor, Vinton’s novel was published in Albany, New York, presumably by virtue of Vinton’s many connections in that state, where he worked as a lawyer and, af- ter retiring in 1884, became the assistant editor of the North American Review. 118 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="21"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 119 The Northeast was not immune to the pressures of Chinese labor—an at- tempt to bring seventy-five Chinese workers to break a strike at a shoe fac- tory in North Adams, Massachusetts, in 1870 produced an outcry that spread across the Northeast and Midwest, a mass meeting involving three to four thousand people, and articles in such places as the New York Herald (Vinton’s hometown newspaper) and the Springfield Republican (Bellamy’s).35 It is nonetheless fair to say that the issues most pressing to the writers of classi- cally anti-Chinese science fiction in California did not weigh as heavily on the writers of the Northeast, and also that the intellectual and social con- text in which Vinton’s book appeared had far more to do with the politico- economic debates about the state of labor and division of wealth incited by Bellamy’s Looking Backward than it did with the specific threat posed by any one group of immigrants.  That said, the novel’s avoidance of the stock figures of its genre, no mat- ter how dull that evasion made the novel to its potential audiences, no mat- ter how much it owed to Vinton’s membership in the northeastern bour- geoisie, frees the fiction from usual clichés and allows it, finally, to be ideologically interesting. Looking Further Backward’s commercial failure may be the result of its unpalatable compromise with an “Asiatic form” that united monotony, labor, and capital in the figure of the coolie. The novel ac- cepts as permanent the terms of the matrix that brought together China, in- dustrialized labor, and the American future. Rather than seek to undo the “loss” caused by industrialized modernity, and thus attempt to preserve in fiction the purer, whiter, more Jacksonian America to which industrialism was opposed, Vinton’s narrative attempts to think the possibility of a future defined by the combination of Chineseness and labor. The loss that such a future constitutes produces the “happy” ending that makes the novel’s emo- tional structure so weird, since the “solution” to the problems of industrial capitalism can only occur through the suffering caused by the novel’s re- fusal, having now made the Chinese a deus ex machina of American history, to relegate them back to the historical margins where they “belonged.” For Vinton, that is, the American landscape, insofar as it is also the land- scape of modernity, is now and will continue to be “Asiatic” in “formation and scenery,” not just because of some geographical truth but rather be- cause the very nature of the world has in fact become “Asiatic” as well. Rather than leading, as it does in the more dystopian narratives of Chinese invasion, to a deadening automatization of the American people and the end of “freedom,” the novel’s “Chinafication” of the United States is in fact the cost of a freedom understood as a right to self-governance at the individ- ual level earned by giving up the right to self-governance at the national one. In this sense the political warfare of the novel functions as an allegory for the economic situation to which “China” generally referred in the late Chinese Bodies, Chinese Futures 119 </page> <page sequence="22"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 120 nineteenth century (just as any literal Chinese “invasion” metaphorizes the Chinese immigration to which “invasion” referred figuratively in the first place). Buried in the novel’s acceptance of a political domination by the Chinese—figuring, as I’m suggesting, an economic one—is thus an insight about the nature of capitalism and the globalization of the labor market that has historically been difficult to come to terms with, namely the notion that the production of transnational networks of labor and trade undermines the isolability and independence of the nation-state. Vinton’s abandonment of the political concept of the United States is essentially the mark of that recognition, though the novel is at its most utopian when it suggests that American individualism could, unlike the nation-state, be retained in the future Chinese colony.  What happens, in this future, to the Chinese “coolie”? The crucial figure in so much of the discourse about China and the American future makes no appearance in Vinton’s novel at all. Here one might say, as Walter Benjamin did of the masses in the oeuvre of Charles Baudelaire, that coolies have “be- come so much a part of [Vinton’s thinking] that it is rare to find a description of them in his works,” and thus that his “most important subjects are hardly ever encountered in descriptive form,” imagining therefore that the coolie’s “absence” from the novel functions more as a determining negative space, a sort of ideological black hole around which the novel revolves and from which it cannot escape.36 Vinton’s Chinese resemble Julian West more than they do the American Nationalists; in many ways they are simply the ghosts of the good nineteenth century come back to haunt the United States back into a recogni- tion of its core values. Only in the presence of his major feature—the ability to suffer, to endure without complaint the cost of an “Asiatic” modernity—do we see the shadow presence of the coolie in this novel. As that suffering has been displaced, as I have suggested, to the affective level, where it lays its burden on the backs of the humiliated college students and readers who must accept, the novel argues, the facts of their historical failure in order to emerge into the possibility of a successful utopian future, the coolie’s relation to suffering be- comes the twice-universalized affective experience of the novel’s readers. Continuously subject to the exposition of a scene of suffering, the readers are enjoined to reconceive themselves—however painfully—as citizens of the novel’s new Chinese America. This is the affective impossibility Li proposes at the end of the novel: that the reader would give up on the hierarchies of cul- tural or racial superiority that sustained anti-Chinese discourse in the nine- teenth century—and that helped make it such a useful figure for the economic problems it simultaneously encoded and concealed—as the price of imagin- ing modernity’s post-Nationalist, and postnationalist, future: that the reader, in short, become one kind of “coolie” in order to save himself from becoming another. 120 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="23"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 121 The complex play of commensurability and incommensurability Look- ing Further Backward organizes around the anti-Chinese discourse of its era does not make it “ahead” of its time in any sense; it is, rather, completely of its time without, for all that, being identical with it. The coolie’s biolog- ically impossible body threatened a future in which modernity had to be “endured” rather than fought off—and thus a future in which the condi- tion of the coolie’s suffering body was to become the condition of all bod- ies everywhere. By moving the problem of that suffering into the affective register, Vinton purchased the utopia engendered by the conflagration of modernity at the price of an enduring loss, one whose suffering was the very condition of the possibility of a future without coolie labor. And while the fact that Looking Further Backward generates this return of suf- fering through the Chinese army shows how close it was to the imagi- nary of the late-nineteenth-century United States, the fact that it is the Americans—as readers and as diegetic characters—who suffer most from the narration shows how far Vinton was willing to go to think the terms of the system that tied the American future to China without, like so many others, eliminating one of those terms through legal or physical violence. Still, the novel’s violence is at least partly genocidal. It thus apprehends how deeply the Western perception of Chinese suffering had to do with the possibility of genocidal transformation, though not, as Vinton is prac- tically alone in imagining, of the Chinese as a race, but of the very possi- bility of an organic human subjectivity disconnected from the suffering of alienated labor. This does not invalidate the idea of an ontological link between Chineseness and suffering, but reconfirms it, though in a more global and self-directed register that makes the Chinese “present” double a universal future. The Anthropomorphic Aperture Connecting the history of Asiatic form explicitly to the anxieties faced by mainstream American culture about both exoticism and technol- ogy shows how the Asian body in America has always been (seen as), in some sense, a doubled or doubly mediated figure, forced to bear on its sur- face the mutually intermediating concepts of racial otherness and indus- trial modernization. In the American context, that body’s figural duplicity has most often been marked by the convention of calling it “inscrutable,” suggesting that its exterior surface conceals an unavailable internal mean- ing. Indeed one might think of all the ink spilled on explaining the Chinese in the late nineteenth century as an attempt simultaneously to undo and preserve that inscrutability, the project of explaining its mysteries raveled with the pleasure of enjoying its irreducible strangeness. Chinese Bodies, Chinese Futures 121 </page> <page sequence="24"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 122 That this inscrutability revealed itself again and again in the faces, man- ners, and speeches of particular Chinese bodies suggests that the duplicity of the Chinese as an ideological figure (signaling simultaneously past and fu- ture, racial primitivism and modernization, suffering and a possible end to suffering via indifference) was best made intelligible by giving it an anthro- pomorphic form. To be in the presence of an Asiatic figure and, by exten- sion, to be in the presence of an Asiatic body already layered over with this figure as stereotype, meant for many Americans to feel threatened by the vis- ible duplicity of an embodied, human sign. Or, to be in the presence of the visible duplicity of an embodied, human sign was to be in the presence, by definition, of something Asiatic: past and future, animal and superman. Though the claim that the Chinese were “inscrutable” attributes this uncer- tainty to the subjective surfaces of the Chinese face (inexpressive) or lan- guage (devious), it may be truer to say that the representational uncertainty provoked by the Chinese resided with the encounter with a form of racial and cultural otherness that posed (or was made to pose) so insistently the complex, multifaceted questions of labor, of globalization, and of modern- ization. If the surface exterior of the Asiatic was, as Lye suggests, “modern- ization rendered visible,” it was because the Asiatic body represented to (white) America the interpellated subject of modern technology and mod- ern labor, born to endure processes occurring on scales extreme enough to exceed the measure of “humanity” itself, thus becoming a figure for moder- nity’s complex, tiered relation to any given human life.37 So the intricate and multiple truth of the Chinese as a figure, the degree to which it united in a single form the contradictions of the American experience of the future called “modernity,” became the falsehood attributed to the Chinese as people, as though the multiple representational functions the Chinese figure was made to bear in white America could only be perceived as an anthropomor- phized cascade of masks and misrepresentations that concealed some with- held, secret inner kernel. The body of the Chinese worker was thus a figure for the age, an embod- ied metaphor for the changes prompted by modernization and the global- ized trade and labor networks it permitted. In this sense, as Lye has written, “the historical emergence of Asiatic racial form [in the United States] can be read as the appearance of the otherness of Western modernity to itself,” that is, of the distorted and fantasmatic face of modernity’s negative aspects, re- turning to the West from an “outside” that was very much an inside.38 The apparent primitiveness of the Chinese worker—his “pagan” ways, his disre- gard for “civilized” standards of speech or behavior, his language, “syllabled in the childhood of humanity”—was one side of his biologically impossible presence in the United States.39 But this primitiveness was matched by the consistent threat he posed to the “survival” of American manhood. He figured 122 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="25"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 123 simultaneously the past and the future, or perhaps most precisely, a future defined by the return of an economic past understood as explicitly Chinese: again, a figural duplicity that could repose only awkwardly on the surface of any single body.40 It is perhaps because American ideas about the Chinese so insistently re- turned to the question of bodies, to the physical ability to endure the condi- tions of modern life and modern labor (for example, the ability to survive on a near-starvation diet) without complaint, that work in Asian American studies has consistently thought of race as located most fundamentally in a set of human minds and human bodies. Lye argues, to the contrary, that the structures that make the Asiatic a figure for (and index of) globalizing labor markets suggest that race is not a human concept but an economic one, that the “form” governing its representation and even its phenomenological ex- perience owes more to the movements of capital than to the white percep- tion of racial otherness. Considered within the framework of this essay, the lesson might be, pushing Lye’s insight one step further, that the body itself is not an anthropomorphic object, at the same time that it is the original and least distorted of all anthropomorphisms—the only anthropomorphic ob- ject, one might say, that is identical with itself. The experience of the Chi- nese as duplicitous is the phenomenological apprehension—and rejection, given the negative connotations of “duplicitous”—of this complex and fre- quently unwelcome truth, a recognition of the ways in which bodies, in be- coming vehicles of historical and economic meaning, leave behind their status as the naked, fleshy apertures of some purer and more apparently original form of being.  Lye’s forceful de-anthropomorphization of the concept of race in the American context thus leads us to a broader theory of the disappointments of what one might call anthropomorphic desire, that is, of the disappoint- ments produced by the awareness that an originary fantasy of the body’s per- sonal and human simplicity can only be thought in relation to such larger and more inhuman concepts as transnationalism, diaspora, globalization, or the history of the means of production. Utopian fiction has long been one of the means by which humans have attempted to reconcile these two seem- ingly incommensurable modes of historical time, which Fredric Jameson has called the “lived” and the “geologic.”41 In Looking Further Backward we see how Vinton’s transformation and universalization of the coolie’s embodied suffering into an affective and future-oriented register is only possible be- cause of the novel’s apprehension of the malleability of the coolie’s anthro- pomorphic form, so that Vinton’s imaginary future retains the conceptual and ideological kernel of the coolie (the unity of modernity and suffering) while shedding its physical husk and—more or less—its racial and cultural specificity.  Chinese Bodies, Chinese Futures 123 </page> <page sequence="26"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 124 But the forceful and unceasing repetition of fantasies about the coolie’s body, which have in our time given way to larger-scale anxieties about the low cost of Chinese labor (understood now not as a racial feature but as an economic one) and about the physically dangerous and abusive working conditions in Chinese factories (here “racial” form still echoes), remind us that the other side of our recognition of the body’s nonanthropomorphism is its relentless return to the anthropomorphic, that is, to a sense of itself as the most basic and truest idiom of individual experience and historical inter- pretation. It is tempting to describe the relation between these two concepts of the body as dialectical, the oscillation between the body as phenomeno- logical base and the body as cultural superstructure thus defining one major organizing framework of Western thought since, say, the intellectual revolu- tions produced by Hegel or Marx. This would require, however, ceding the very premise of the argument, since such a dialectic would imagine that the “original” and fully self-sufficient body were not, like the body that figures modes of production, itself already a figure for something, namely, for the lack or absence of distorting figura- tion. The opposition is not between the nonfigural and the figural, but be- tween a figure of nonfiguration and a figure that wears its figuration openly. Into this lopsided dialectic—for it turns out that both its thesis and antithesis are, finally, on the same side—strides the “Chinese body,” whose duplicity encoded the anathematic awareness that the honest and open body it fails to be is in fact the one it most accurately represents. And likewise, crucially, as re- gards the coolie’s relation to pain: what is the transformation of his racially specific experience of physical suffering into a generalized affective one, af- ter all, but the extension of an experience belonging to, and encoded in the flesh of, a single type of body, to the entire realm of human existence that Vinton imagines as the economic and political structure of his utopian fu- ture? Carried from the “inside” of the Chinese figure to a universal “out- side,” from physiology to affect, suffering’s travels figure the movement from an inscrutable inner life oriented around a mystery of otherness to the ex- pression of a coherent logic of national self-defense that recognizes that some forms of pain are the cost of an “individual” human future liberated from the yawning threat of the human machine.  Placed in the open, the experience of suffering reveals itself as the uni- versal condition of Vinton’s utopian modernity, while the Chinese, stripped of their private racial relation to pain, become as “American” as anyone else in the diegesis—which is why it doesn’t matter that the invading Chinese cre- ates a hybrid nation full of immigrants. When Julian West—whose last name signaled in Bellamy’s Looking Backward the transformation of the nineteenth century’s frontier of space to the twenty-first century’s frontier of time—dies in the battle of Lake Erie in Vinton’s novel, the nineteenth century dies with 124 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="27"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 125 him. And Won Lung Li becomes the end of history’s “last man,” narrating to a captive audience the grammatical accommodation with suffering, which, in externalizing pain’s Asiatic form, makes that form the condition of a uni- versal modernity. This modernity hovers on the eternal threshold of the Chinese-American present, where it waits, patiently, for its admission.  Notes 1.

Thomas, who writes that Edward Bellamy’s “revolution creates an affluent and abundant society, but more important, it brings an intensified psychic awareness similar to the ‘noosphere’ or ‘noosystem’ of Teilhard de Chardin and Julian Huxley.

Moon-Ho Jung notes that 1848 is the year in which the word “cooly,” used since the sixteenth century to refer to Indian and Chinese laborers, moved “from the appendix to the main body of Noah Webster’s American dictionary,” and this was at the very moment at which coolies were becoming “indentured laborers in high demand across the world, particularly in the tropical colonies of the Caribbean”; Moon-Ho Jung, “Outlawing ‘Coolies’: Race, Nation, and Empire in the Age of Emancipation,” American Quarterly 57, no. 3 (2005): 679.

CC. Lydia Liu writes in her introduction to Smith that his book was only re- placed as an authority on China by Pearl S. Buck’s The Good Earth (1931) and cites a 1925 survey that ranks Chinese Characteristics first on a list of the most im- portant Western works on China. Among its many translations were several in Chinese and Japanese, which Liu discusses at length in Translingual Practice: Literature, National Culture, and Translated Modernity—China, 1900–1937 (Stan- ford, 1995). 15. It is for these reasons that anti-Chinese activists often insisted—echoing the hopes of the manufacturers who hoped to hire Chinese workers—that the Chi- nese could not be trusted to unionize, that they lacked the fellow-feeling and political will necessary to strike. Such claims were nonsense, since Chinese workers struck on a number of occasions, both on their own and as part of “mainstream” strikes. See Andrew Gyory, Closing the Gate: Race, Politics, and the Chinese Exclusion Act (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1998), 98–100, for a description of Chi- nese participation in the cigar makers’ strike of 1877. Gyory cites the Labor 126 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="29"> REP99_05.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 127 Standard, which remarks that “in joining the strike, the Chinese ‘showed them- selves capable of real civilization’” (98).  16.

I am grateful to R. John Williams for drawing this novel to my attention. Williams’s dissertation brilliantly connects several Chinese invasion novels of this era (of which Vinton’s was the first) to the later ties, in the mod- ernist work of Ezra Pound, between technology and China. 20. I am borrowing narratological terms from Gérard Genette and Roland Barthes. For Gérard Genette, “metadiegetic” refers to a story told by a charac- ter inside a diegetic narrative; Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method (Cornell, 1983). Barthes’s S/Z describes the proairetic code as the code of sequences of actions that fix the narrative to specific times and places—that is, the “plot”; Roland Barthes, S/Z: An Essay, trans. Richard Howard (New York, 1975), 18–19. 21. Williams is the only scholar I know who thinks of Vinton in an Asian American context. Wegner discusses Vinton as a respondent to Bellamy, and Jean Pfaelzer locates him in an American dystopian tradition, though none of these addresses the novel for more than a couple pages; Jean Pfaelzer, “Parody and Satire in American Dystopian Fiction of the Nineteenth Century,” Science-Fiction Studies 7, no. 1 (March 1980). 22. The Chinese ability to resist foreign incursion, specifically the “proselyting” of Nationalist pseudomissionaries (Vinton, Looking Further Backward, 144), testi- fies to the national reversal of fortunes, since the unimpeded right to do mis- sionary work had been one of the concessions forced on China following the second Opium War (1856–60), along with an indemnity of eight million taels (about 3200 metric tons) of silver annually to Britain and France. 23. The citation from West’s diary in the third lecture includes a seven-page repro- duction of a letter he writes to Dr. Leete, his father-in-law, in 2001.  24. My reading of the ways in which characters and narrative modes “compete” for space within the limited framework of the novel owes a great deal to the work of Alex Woloch, who in The One vs. the Many (Princeton, N.J., 2003) develops a narratological practice that analyzes the distribution of “character-space” within a global “character-system” and reads this formal structure as a crucial feature of the novel’s historical development as a genre. 25. This is not to say that there is anything especially American about representa- tion, or Chinese about lecturing. It is to say, rather, that within the internal nar- rative economy of the novel, the transformation it narrates moves from the U.S. to China at the political level, while moving from China to the U.S. at the narrative one.

Though Li begins his final lecture by announcing that “it is with regret that I cease to quote from Professor West’s diary,” in fact he has been citing, for the previous two lectures (and twenty-six pages), from Leete’s journal and not Julian’s. 27. Indeed the transnational, transracial “we” here, spoken to an audience of pre- sumably male college students, gains much from its exclusion of women (now “handmaidens of male humanity”) from the labor force and the classroom, something that apparently men of every race and nation can agree on.  28. Fredric Jameson, “Of Islands and Trenches: Neutralization and the Production of Utopian Discourse,” Diacritics 7, no. 2 (1977): 3. 29. Likewise with the rebel Nationalists: just as the “good” aspects of American Na- tionalism have been retained in the Chinese colony, the rebels “have learned from their reverses, and the Nationalistic system of government has been changed until to-day it does not so much differ from that which we enjoy”; Vin- ton, Looking Further Backward, 187. The “we” that Li uses in the final paragraph thus represents both the merging of the American Nationalist political system with its Chinese counterpart and the birth of a new hybrid entity whose gram- matical form underpins a utopian political reality. 30. Sianne Ngai, Ugly Feelings (Cambridge, Mass., 2006). 31. Williams defines a “structure of feeling” as “a social experience still in process, often indeed not yet recognized as social but taken to be private, idiosyncratic, and isolating,” and as “a cultural hypothesis” about the nature of a social pre- sent still in the process of emerging; Raymond Williams, Marxism and Literature (Oxford, 1977), 132–33.  32.

The book was originally published in Chicago, a factor that may be par- tially explained by (or help to explain) its far more transnational outlook— though the oligarchy is “Asiatic” in form, the novel’s enemy is a generalized world culture that derives not from military invasion but from the progress of monopoly capitalism.

It wasn’t until the early twentieth century that English-language writers began to worry explicitly about a military invasion coming from Japan, presumably for reasons having largely to do with the changing national positions of the two major East Asian nations, codified most clearly in the Japanese victory against Russia (1905) and the fall of the Chinese Qing regime in 1911.  35.

It was in the nineteenth century that theories of Oriental despotism and the Asiatic mode of production suggested that China had stagnated, despite its great wealth, because it divided that wealth so unevenly between a small num- ber of dissipated oligarchs, on one hand, and countless undifferentiated peas- ants, on the other—a threat to freedom and economic equality posed, also, by the threat of monopoly capitalism sustained by wage labor.
