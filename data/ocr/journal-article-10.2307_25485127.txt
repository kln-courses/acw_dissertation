<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eleusinian Archetype and Ritual in "Eumaeus" and "Ithaca" Martha Celeste Carpentier Seton Hall University Female archetypes-women rendered as symbols of power, both creative and destructive-assume a force in the writing of the modernist generation that they have rarely known at any time before or since. Particularly for Forster, Woolf, and Joyce, life gains meaning through physical realities that recur eternally, year after year, a regenerative power they symbolize in the female arche type. Such "delicious fecundity" is embodied in Mrs. Ramsay and contrasted with the desiccation of her husband, who needs her "circle of life" when his philosophic abstractions leave him "barren," and in Forster's Mrs. W?cox, who hovers over the characters even after her death as an immanent spirit of eternal regeneration through the material "realities" of house, tree, field, and ch?d.1 And, of course, Molly Bloom stands as the apotheosis of such an arche typal genetrix. The extraordinary predominance of these literary female arche types is closely related to the impact of late nineteenth-century anthropological and archaeological discoveries on myth interpreta tion, and their revelation that "the Great Mother is prior to the masculine divinities" in primitive religion.2 The power of ma triarchal goddesses in pre-Olympian Greek religion?Artemis, De meter, Persephone, and others-began to emerge in Frazer's Golden Bough, primarily in Part 5, "Spirits of the Corn and of the Wild" (vols. I and II). While Frazer did not consciously set out to pursue the status of women in early Greek religion, his study of the male archetype of "dying god" led him to discover that at the basis of ritual sacrifice lay fertility cults, and at the basis of fertility cults stood powerful primitive mother-goddesses, Hellenic matriarchal god desses were studied more thoroughly by his contemporary, Jane Ellen Harrison, whose influence on modernist writers has been virtually ignored, despite evidence of the popularity of her work.3 In her first major study, the Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion 221</page><page sequence="2">(1903)-which, according to Gilbert Murray "transformed the whole approach to the study of Greek religion"4-Harrison ex plained the differences between "chthonic" matriarchal rituals and Homeric patriarchal rituals, explored the meaning of matriarchal rituals at the annual Hellenic festivals such as Eleusis, and described "The Making of a Goddess," the genesis of the traditional female archetypes of witch, mother, and maid. These mythic female archetypes bear a special creative signifi cance for the artist in modernist fiction. The young artist, such as Lily Briscoe and Stephen Dedalus, is portrayed as experiencing some kind of ritual union with the female archetypes who dominate these works before he or she is fully able to create. It is as if they must draw the final strength and vision necessary for their craft from a deep symbolic understanding of the ultimate creatrix. Since arche typal images are universal and essentially unchanging, a more spe cific understanding of these traditional forms in Greek myth and ritual can yield insight into their significance in literature. The com parative method of myth criticism is a particularly appropriate ap proach to modernists such as Joyce who consciously employed the "mythic method," finding in myth and ritual a substratum for their "emotions and feelings" and an answer to the "futility and anarchy/' indeed, the godlessness, of their age.5 Myth criticism today exists largely because of Northrop Frye and others, who, as John M. Warner points out, were "concerned not so much with the substance of myth as with their structures, that is, the narrative principles that are involved in their telling."6 One unfortunate result of the long dominance of Frye's approach has been the loss to modern myth criticism of "the substance of myth," the anthropological specificity that so enriched the work of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century mythologists. Myth criti cism has been justly attacked for being too general, and nowhere is such criticism more valid than when levied against archetypal inter pretations of Molly Bloom, which typically devolve into such mean ingless stereotypes as the "Eternal Feminine," "the generous, nur turing, all-embracing mother of the world," or "the mystery of animate Flesh, the Earth, Nature."7 We have sentimentalized the "earth-mother" archetype until she is no more than an overweight, nurturing clich?, but she was a much more precisely drawn being to the modernist writer. By referring to Molly as "Gea-Tellus" Joyce could evoke a whole world of mythic meaning beyond Homer's Penelope that is no longer readily available to our imaginations. Warner has proposed that considering Joyce "an apostle of myth," creating a "timeless" world of universal archetypes need not contra 222</page><page sequence="3">diet the novel's world of "particular individuals," "temporal se quence," and "historical reality"; rather, that both exist simul taneously in a "consistent dialectical interplay"8 In addition to this eminently sensible suggestion, we must realize that for Joyce and others of his generation, the world of myth was not so radically divorced from the world of temporal historicity as it is for us today largely because of the pervasive influence of the so-called "ritual theory," which declared that myths evolved out of religious rituals actually performed by primitive peoples. Promulgated by Frazer and Harrison, this sense that myths are not fabulous tales but rather reflections of rituals that had been an integral part of annual life was further disseminated during the 1920s through the work of classi cists such as EM. Cornford and Gilbert Murray and sociologists such as Emile Durkheim and Lucien L?vy-Bruhl, among many oth ers.9 We can better understand Molly as "Gea-Tellus" and her arche typal relation to both Bloom and Stephen by looking outside Ho mer's patriarchal Olympians to the more ancient Hellenic matriarchal myth of Demeter and Persephone and their ritual wor ship at Eleusis. The "Da" of Da-mater has been etymologized as equivalent to the G? of Gaia; hence Demeter is literally "earth"-mother, the mythic granddaughter of Gea, the Hesiodic genetrix of the gods. Demeter is a later incarnation of the earth-mother created by a settled, agri cultural people, and she played a more vital role in the daily life of man than Gaia, for her power brought forth the grain from earth upon which survival depended. The Homeric Hymn to Demeter, discovered in a farmyard at Moscow in 1777, is our source for the myth of Persephone's abduction by Hades to the underworld, De meter's agony over the loss of her daughter, and her prolonged fasting and blighting of the earth. Angry and desolate, she wan dered to Eleusis where she was taken in and consoled by the king's wife and daughters, yet her "wrath" continued to blight the earth with sterility "Now would the whole race of mortal men have per ished utterly from the stress of famine" if Zeus had not allowed Persephone to return to her mother.10 Joyfully reunited, Demeter transformed the barren plains into rich fields of grain, but since Persephone had eaten Hades' pomegranate seeds she had to return to the world of the dead each year "for as long as the ears of corn were below the ground."11 Frazer stressed that "the main theme which the poet set before himself in composing this hymn was to describe the traditional foundation of the Eleusinian mysteries by the goddess Demeter." At the conclusion of the hymn, "the benefi cent deity takes the princes of Eleusis.. .[and] teaches them her 223</page><page sequence="4">mystic rites."12 Thus, according to the "ritual theory," the hymn offers a mythic explanation of rituals long performed at the Eleusi nian mysteries. Since the 1890s, archaeological information in creasingly supported the contention that the rituals experienced by initiates at Eleusis echoed Demeter's fasting, wandering, consola tion, and reunion with her daughter. Further, the parallels between these ritual steps and Stephen and Bloom's "nocturnal perambula tions" in "Eumaeus" and "Ithaca" are remarkable. It would be strange if Joyce were not familiar with the mysteries since for 2,000 years they represented "the primary spiritual conso lation for all Hellenized mankind,"13 References to them abound in myriad classical sources, extensively in Euripides, Sophocles, Aristophanes, Plutarch, Pindar, Apollonius Rhodius, and Clement of Alexandria, among others. In addition, it is clear from Joyce's notes that he studied the Demeter/Persephone myth in Wilhelm Roscher's encyclopedic Ausf?hrliches Lexikon der griechischen und r?mischen Mythologie.14 He also knew the myth, in very general terms, from Professor Carl Witt's Myths of Hellas: or Greek Tales, the 1883 English translation of which he kept with him throughout his several moves.15 The mysteries have compelled excavation, study, and conjecture from their demise in early Christian times to the present day, and Joyce may have learned more about them through reading German or French archaeologists, or through the English anthropologists. In the chapter "Spirits of the Corn and of the Wild," Frazer discusses the Hymn to Demeter and the Eleusinian mysteries in detail, but whether or not Joyce read Frazer is problematic. John Vickery writes: "Unlike Yeats, Lawrence, and Eliot, James Joyce gives no explicit indication.. .of having been acquainted with The Golden Bough or the other work of Sir James Frazer."16 At the same time, given the pervasive influence of Frazer's opus, it is hard to imagine that Joyce did not leaf through it at one time or another, and Vickery has drawn parallels between the two works on this assumption. Yet while Frazer illuminated mythic rituals more than any other anthropologist of his time, for him the role they played in modern life was strictly limited. Rituals in modern European civilization cropped up only in peasant "survivals": the superstitions, holidays, and "rustic mummers' plays" acted by "English yokels" and "ploughmen for the purpose of fertilising the brown earth" (GB 33). Frazer did not entertain the notion that primitive rituals could affect the life of the civilized, educated English gentleman, yet for Joyce ritual was a more integral part of all human life, a mythic level on which the deepest psychological needs (such as incest) could be 224</page><page sequence="5">acted out and perhaps resolved. In this sense Joyce was theoretically much closer in spirit to Jane Harrison, who likewise believed that rituals form an essential "bridge" between actual life and its recrea tion in art for modern man as much as for primitive man. In all her works she tried to show "the intimate connection which.. .exists between ritual and art," and she believed that this connection had "an important bearing on... what the nature of art is and how it can help or hinder spiritual life."17 Both writers saw art as creating the spiritual catharsis for modern man that ritual once provided for ancient man. Joyce owned her Mythology and, while this anthology of myths is a late production (1924), his possession of it suggests an acquaintance with her earlier, more significant volumes, such as the Prolegomena.18 A third classicist whose work probably provided Joyce with a source for the Eleusinian myth was Andrew Lang. Joyce relied on the Butcher/Lang translation of the Odyssey, and it is quite likely that for the Homeric Hymn to Demeter he would also turn to Lang's lovely prose translation of 1884. Lang is best known as a translator and folklorist, yet few realize that between 1884 and 1907 he devoted six volumes to defending "the anthropological method" of myth inter pretation-the application of new anthropological discoveries about aboriginal ritual to a revolutionary understanding of classical my thology19 His first volume in this series, Custom and Myth (1884), contains an essay entitled "Moly and Mandragora" in which he analyzes the primitive use of herbs and roots for magical purposes, including the potato: "the English magic potato, the German man drake, the Greek moly, are all survivals from a condition of mind... that expects supernatural aid from plants and roots."20 This clear association of the folk "potato cure" with Homeric moly provides evidence that Joyce derived Bloom's keepsake from Lang's essay His apparent familiarity with Lang's "anthropological" period argues a similar knowledge of Lang's Homeric Hymn to Demeter, published in 1899. But whichever source Joyce used, that he knew the hymn is proven by Stephen's drunken reference to "an old hymn to Demeter" in "Circe." He mumbles, "The rite is the poet's rest" (L?15.2088), suggesting that Eleusinian ritual, symbolically enacted by Bloom and Stephen in "Ithaca," may affect his evolution as an artist. Through the psychological purgation offered by ritual acting out, the poet may finally come to rest. "In general by a mystery is meant a rite in which certain sacra [sacred objects] are exhibited, which cannot be safely seen by the worshipper till he has undergone certain purifications," and the first ritual act at Eleusis was purification by water: "The bathing in the sea 225</page><page sequence="6">was a purification, a conducting out, a banishing of evil."21 Next there followed "the torchlight procession, the all-night vigil" (GB 37), "the wandering quest that corresponded to the.. .wanderings of Demeter herself and her lamentations."22 The hymn tells how Demeter fasted until she reached the palace of Eleusis where the women first offered her wine, which she refused, "saying that it was not permitted for her to drink red wine; but she bade them mix meal and water with the tender herb of mint, and give it to her to drink."23 At Eleusis the initiates purified themselves by fasting like Demeter until "the solemn communion with the divinity by participation in a draught of barley-water from a holy chalice" (GB 37). Harrison explains that Demeter refused wine?as do the matriarchal Eu menides portrayed by both Sophocles and Aeschylus?because ma triarchal rituals required offerings of more primitive agricultural products such as barley, wheat, oil, honey, milk, as opposed to the wine-based communions of later patriarchal rituals, from sacrifices to the Olympians as portrayed in Homer to the Eucharist (PSGR 91-92,156). The climax of the Eleusinian experience consisted of a "supreme vision," a "revelation... in the midst of a great light," but of the sacra thus revealed "we know nothing," for the Eleusinian initiate was sworn to secrecy (ESM144; WRE 78; PSGR 157). Was it a revelation of the foods sacred to the earth-mother, as the Christian Clement "contemptuously" suggested? Or was it "Persephone her self," symbolically reborn from the underworld, "flashed on the experient's soul, [in] the same flash of revelation [which] showed him his own continuity, the continued existence of all living things" (WRE 80; ESM 142)? While these "mysterious goings-on" in the "telesterion" (hall of initiation) can never be positively determined, there is ample evidence that the experience gave spiritual consola tion?the assurance of life's eternal renewal. Sophocles described those who have reached the vision at Eleusis as "thrice happy... for them alone is there life in death; for the rest Hades is evil and joyless." Eleusis celebrated "the end of life as well as its divinely granted beginning," as Pindar wrote (ESM 144-45). Thus, after en during Demeter's loss of Persephone to the realm of death, not only is life reaffirmed by the daughter's return, but the Eleusinian initiate viewed or ritually celebrated a sacred marriage and the birth of a divine boy to the "Kore" (Persephone or, literally "Maiden") as the maid herself became mother. A rich, manifold symbol formed "the triumphal close of the piece": "silently a mown ear of grain was exhibited" (GB 39; ESM 148). According to Harrison, "The close conjunction in which the two rites are placed makes it highly proba ble, though not absolutely certain, that the one, the human birth, 226</page><page sequence="7">was but the anthropomorphic form of the other," the reaped grain (PSGR 550). Finally two vessels were filled with water and over turned, representing fertility and the celebrants joined in an exul tant dance. It is difficult for the modern mind, however agnostic, to conceive of a religion in which spirituality and physicality are not opposed but united. Yet vegetative fertility human sexuality, and life beyond death were inextricably bound in the ancient mind; this was the essence of the Eleusinian mysteries and, most likely, the reason for its appeal to Joyce, for whom all that was metaphysical was first physical. Primitive symbolism is at once powerfully material and equally powerfully divine: the grain held aloft was worshipped in awed silence as civilization's primary food source and at the same time as the Kore. It held within its "budlike" womb the continuity of society, just as the Maiden held within her womb individual "conti nuity and continual rebirth in one's own offspring" (ESM 144). Frazer too emphasized that material and spiritual are not separate but united in the matriarchal Hellenic divinity: the goddess "does not make the corn and vine grow, but she is the corn and vine growing, and returning again to the face of the earth after lying hidden in its depths" (GB 46). As the grain is buried beneath the earth, so Persephone descends into the underworld to experience death and sexuality. There she eats the seeds of Hades; she is inseminated, and again like the grain, she brings forth life from death in an annually renewed miracle. Thus at Eleusis, in contrast to the Christian tradition, spiritual eternity is achieved through the celebration, not the denial, of elemental material verities. In Leopold Bloom, Joyce has created a character for whom phys ical realities such as food continually reaffirm spiritual confidence in the eternal coming of life from death. At the end of "Scylla and Charybdis" Stephen passes the "dark back" of Bloom on the library stairs and then interprets in mythic ritual terms "two plumes of smoke" he observes spiraling upwards from the rooftops: "Cease to strive. Peace of thedruid priests of Cymbeline: hi?rophante from wide earth an altar" (119:1214-22). Only priests at Eleusis bear the name "hierophant," meaning the "'priestly demonstrator' of the holy mysteries" who guided initiates through the ritual to the final visionary experience, where "what he revealed was the principal thing" (ESM 140). Bloom's ritual role, then, is the "hierophant" who will steer Stephen, the initiate, through the "all-night vigil" of Ele usinian ritual to a final vision of Molly the earth-goddess, behind the lighted window shade in "Ithaca," where, to use Kerenyi's vivid phrase, "the goddess is flashed on the experient's soul" (ESM 142). 227</page><page sequence="8">This perception of Bloom as hierophant in no way contradicts, but augments, David L. McCarroll's interpretation of Bloom appearing as Haroun al Raschid, the Arabian Night's caliph, in Stephen's dream.24 The purpose of both symbolic manifestations of Bloom is to lead Stephen to Molly or to some psychic experience of what the archetypal Molly represents. While much attention has been focused on Stephen's dream, relatively little has been said about Bloom's beyond the fact that it obviously echoes Stephen's. William Walcott, a Jungian psychologist, found that "there is not enough of Bloom's dream to have any confidence about the meaning,"25 but we can understand Bloom's dream fragment if we see that he envisions himself playing a hierophantic role toward Stephen. When he re calls, "Come in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What?" (IZ13.878), his dream suggests that the hierophant's ritual objects-torch, commu nal cup, food, and drink- are prepared as he invites the initiate into the telesterion. The Eleusinian ritual begins with cleansing in "the purifying element," water, and from the beginning of "Eumaeus" Bloom, with his initiate in tow, seeks water for their "ablutions," whereas Ste phen has merely expressed the desire for "some beverage" to drink, probably alcohol. Bloom's notion, however, is "some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral" (?I16.05-10). Throughout "Eumaeus" Bloom as hierophant urges Stephen toward the three elements essential to the experience at Eleusis: food, drink, and "the female form" (U16.895). Just as the hierophant at Eleusis reverently displays the grain symbolic of the recurrent survival of man and culture, so Bloom inhales with joy the "very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread.,. .the staff of life" (L?16.56-58). Again as Ste phen's pagan hierophant, Bloom, "the more experienced of the two" rejects the "supernatural God" as revealed in "Holy Writ" (L?16.771-77). His attention is focused instead on "eatables" (?I16.8Q4), the more material divinity behind primitive Hellenic ritual, as he urges Stephen repeatedly to eat and drink: "Can't you drink that coffee, by the way? Let me stir it. And take a piece of that bun... .Try a bit" (?16.784-87). Thus urged by his "good genius," Stephen attempts "a sip of the offending beverage," but coffee is not the ritual drink to answer Stephen's physical or spiritual needs. As if sensing its inadequacy, Bloom adds, "Still it's solid food... .You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different man" (1116.810-14). The point here, as many critics have noted, is that Stephen needs to be transformed into a "different man" through discovering the spirituality that inheres in physicality, which is the ultimate reassurance achieved by the initiate at Eleusis. 228</page><page sequence="9">Bloom's constant disparaging of whores throughout "Eumaeus" reverberates with mythic connotations beyond his characteristic medical prudence, for as one of Joyce's notes for "Circe" asks: "LB what kind of child can much fucked whore have,"26 Bloom as hiero phant knows that the goal of all primitive ritual is fertility, sexual as well as vegetative. It is as paterfamilias that Bloom feels whores should be "medically inspected," to guard against blighted procrea tion (L?16.743-44). Not only does Stephen need to eat and drink, but it is "a thousand pities" that the "young fellow.. .should waste his valuable time with profligate women" (L?16.1553-55). Bloom feels that Stephen needs to experience a healthier sexuality as well, a sexuality of fecundity rather than sterility of creative renewal rather than enervating onanism. So he presents Stephen with a photo graph of Molly, archetype of fecund female sexuality. As with the sacra at Eleusis, the symbolic likeness of the photograph to the goddess it represents should "speak for itself" so that the initiate can "drink in the beauty for himself"-or ritually experience the univer sal "female form in general" (U16.1457-59,1449). Molly's incarnation as Hellenic goddess here is emphasized by the parallel Bloom makes between the photograph and the Grecian statues he has seen in the National Museum, Unlike the photograph, he thinks, the statues really "do justice to her figure," to its "opulent curves": "Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn't art in a word" (UI6.1445-55). The photograph seems sufficiently stimulating for the enamored hierophant, however, who feels he may have to go outside to "satisfy a possible need by moving a motion" (L?16.1463-64) if he looks at it much longer, but, like the coffee, it is insufficient to move Stephen. Bloom worries over Stephen's moth erlessness, picturing him "rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother," and over his protege's need for food and drink, "were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment" (L?16.1566-70, 342). Clearly Stephen's need for "maternal nutri ment"-physical, sexual, and mythical-cannot be adequately ful filled by the rank coffee and stale roll of the cabman's shelter, or even by the photograph of Molly. Finally, when Bloom learns that Ste phen has been fasting for two days (as do the initiates at Eleusis), the hierophant realizes he must bring his initiate to the telesterion at 7 Eccles street. Every action performed in "Ithaca" corroborates Bloom's role as hierophant. The words of his dream: "Come in, all is prepared" achieve actuality as he stands "in the open space of the doorway" holding the "portable candle," his priestly torch (U17.107,116-17). 229</page><page sequence="10">As "waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier" he performs the ablu tions first hinted at in "Eumaeus" .(1117.183). It is as if, in Joyce's accretive, "scientific paean" to water,27 even the reader is made to experience the sea bath of the initiates. At Eleusis "water and darkness played the chief part." The initiate is "wrapped in darkness" until he experiences a revelation "in the midst of a great light" (ESM 139; WRE 78). To bring this "Light to the gentiles" (U17.353), the hierophant prepares the ritual drink that echoes Demeter's drinking at the palace of Eleusis and brings communion with her: "The initiate entered into the figure of Demeter by doing what the sorrowing and wrathful goddess did: fasted and then drank the mixed drink" (ESM 138). As at any holy communion, and Eleusis is no exception, the vessel from which initiates drink is a ritual object of sacred importance. So Bloom "Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent.. .substituted a cup identical with that of his guest," indicating that he will join Stephen in experiencing the ritual (as did the hierophant at Eleusis), even though he is the leader, already initiate (U17.361-63). Joyce added, however, that Bloom drinks first: "Who drank more quickly? Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation" (U17.377-78, my italics). So too at Eleusis "the hierophant began the drinking: the initiates then followed his example, waiting, as they listened to his chanting in the darkened telesterion for the moment of revelation" (WRE 84). Joyce loads the episode with words connotative of Greek ritual "sign," "pyre," "vessel," "chanting," "rite"- to indicate that a more ancient ritual than the Eucharist is taking place here. Joyce's use of the word "symposiarch," like his earlier use of "hierophantic," car ries Eleusinian significance. As Richard E. Madtes has noted, "the word comes from syn-posis 'a drinking together.'"28 In addition, however, Ruck defines "symposiarchos" as the leader at "a sym posium or social drinking party" who "ceremoniously determines" the "intensity of inebriation" by deciding "what ratio of dilution would be used" (WRE 90). Thus, "symposiarch" emphasizes Bloom's hierophantic role of determining the visionary experience of the participant, as he carefully measures out "two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps's soluble cocoa" (?17.355-56). Madtes cites Joyce's note, "SD cocoa 'creatura,'" as proof that in the line "Epps's mass product, the creature cocoa," Joyce intends their drinking to echo the Eucharist.29 However, Joyce deliberately departs from Christian symbolism here, and Eucharistie associations give way to richer pagan substrata. For these initiates drink milk, the more primitive 230</page><page sequence="11">unfermented fluid requisite to matriarchal ritual, not wine. As if to stress that Stephen finally receives the "unadulterated maternal nutriment" (IT16.1570) symbolic of Molly, Joyce writes that Bloom not only adds boiling water to the soluble cocoa, but also "served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Mar ion (Molly)" (U17.363-65). Bloom has already rejected Holy Writ, and the hierophant and his initiate drink milk not wine; thus, their goal in the ritual is not to experience communion with the asexual man-god, Christ, but rather a communion with the divinity of Demeter, the sexual earth-mother of all "creatura." Yet the Eleusinian mysteries were a celebration of both mother and daughter: "It was above all the under worldly Persephone, the Queen of the Dead, to whom the road of this initiation led" (ESM 139). By understanding the archetypal and ritual meaning of the Kore, we can gain insight into Milly, a character often overlooked in Joyce criticism, and her significance in her father's ruminations. Throughout Ulysses Milly is conspicuous by her absence, which, like Persephone's abduction, coincides with her sexual initiation, as Bloom intuitively fears from his daughter's letter mentioning a "young student" related to Boylan (U4.426-31). For Bloom has not only lost a son, Rudy but he has lost a daughter as well, and while the loss of a child to sexual maturity is much less traumatic than the loss of a child to death, it is still baffling and painful, as Joyce suggests by these crucial lines given at the end of the "Ithaca." After Rudy's death, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation of activity mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental inter course between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there re mained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension be tween the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corpo ral liberty of action had been circumscribed. (U17.2282-92) There has been no physical intercourse between Bloom and Molly since Rudy's death, but the onset of Milly's menstruation has dis turbed the mental intercourse between them. This is because of the "preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension be tween the consummated females." Menstruation is "pre established," "natural" and to the male incomprehensible, yet 231</page><page sequence="12">through this incomprehensible mystery mother and daughter share a "comprehension" that excludes Bloom; they are "consummated." While Bloom blames himself for Rudy's death, he may blame Molly for the loss of his daughter to womanhood; hence the estrangement from their usual mental intimacy. That Joyce intended Bloom to feel his women had united against him is revealed by the notesheets for "Ithaca": "Molly &amp; Milly both turn on LB."30 Milly's symbolic presence, however, permeates the ritual of "Ithaca," just as Persephone's does the Eleusinian ritual. The symbol most evocative of Milly's change and Bloom's loss of his daughter is the photograph, an image already highly charged with female sexu ality from its relation to Molly in "Eumaeus." Bloom's thoughts progress in "Ithaca" from "infantile memories" (L?17.864) of Milly to memories of her adolescence, which are recorded chronologically. First "She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess," then, "entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated)" (U17.876-78). The "objection" is made clear from one of Joyce's notesheets for "Ithaca": "Milly feared her photo part of self."31 Like the photograph of Molly it would have the power to "speak for itself" of her budding sexuality. And Milly's newly acquired sexual instinct warns her against what we readers already know from Bloom's presentation of Molly's photograph to Stephen: men find photo graphs of women sexually titillating. For Bloom, who hides erotic postcards in his desk drawer, not to recognize Milly's motivation in refusing to be photographed reveals the father attempting to repress full acknowledgment of his daughter's sexuality. But the photograph of Molly conveys her spiritually as well as sexually; as I have noted above, Molly appears in her photograph as the universal "female form," the Hellenic earth-goddess. So too Milly's refusal to permit a man to take her photograph is a manifestation of her divinity as Kore, the maiden who is traditionally hidden and protected from view. It is a mythological commonplace (i.e., Actaeon) that men who have the misfortune to spy a virgin goddess while she is bathing suffer an awful fate, usually death. The significance of Milly's job in a photographic studio now becomes obvious. Like Persephone she has crossed the river into death and sexuality; she is no longer the maiden, but united with her mother in fecundity: "I am getting on swimming in the photo business now. Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs Will send when developed'7 (L?4.400-03). All students of Eleusis have stressed the remarkable pictorial similarity between Demeter and Persephone, as Frazer observed: "Greek artists. ..frequently represent the Mother and Daughter 232</page><page sequence="13">side by side in forms which resemble each other so closely [as to be].. .almost indistinguishable" (GB 58), To Frazer the reason for this similarity was obvious: how can we "divide exactly the two persons of the divinity," for "At what precise moment does the seed cease to be the Corn Mother and begin to burgeon out into the Corn Daughter?" (GB 67). And Jane Harrison has described how god desses to the "primitive Greek" were often twofold or threefold, "and this twofold form, shifting and easily interchangeable, is seen to resolve itself very simply into the two stages of a woman's life, as Maiden and Mother" (PSGR 286). To enter into communion with Demeter at Eleusis was therefore to experience Persephone at one and the same moment, since "the two persons of the godhead were one in substance" (GB 67), They "set one another off and coalesce at the same time," reaffirming the eternally cyclical regeneration of life from death (ESM 153). This does not argue, by comparison, anactttal affinity or friendship between Molly and Milly, but it suggests that the association of mother and daughter in Bloom's mind parallels their archetypal association with, ultimately, a similar ritual/psycho logically purgative result. Bloom's fond memories of Milly lead him to ask Stephen "To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on the extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess" (U17.931-34). The "father of Milly" offers both his daughter and wife to Stephen, just as the hierophant at Eleusis offered both Demeter and Persephone to the initiate. After asking Stephen to stay over night, Bloom lists the "various advantages" that might result from the "prolongation" of the arrangement. For himself one advantage would be "vicarious satisfaction" and for Molly a result might be "disintegration of obsession," presumably her obsession with Boy Ian (1117.935-39). Just as hierophant and initiate shared communion with the goddess by drinking together, so Bloom imagines that sharing Molly sexually with Stephen may also grant him "vicarious satisfaction." Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a perma nent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's daughter? Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter, (107.940-44) The schoolfellow here is Stephen, and the question reveals Bloom's hope that the young man might form a "permanent.. .union" with 233</page><page sequence="14">his daughter-a marriage. Joyce's understanding of the essential unity of the archetypal mother and daughter is acute. In Bloom's imagination Stephen's affair with Molly should in no way preclude his union with Milly, since, in a line that might have come from any text describing the Eleusinian mystery, "the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter." Furthermore, not only are mother and daughter one, but father and son are also. As is true of most of the paths Bloom holds open for Stephen, he needs to follow them himself. Bloom will gain a son through physical rapprochement with Molly; he will regain his daughter through spiritual rapprochement with Molly since mother and daughter are united in womanhood, an "incomprehensible" female intimacy that excludes him. In addition, just as imagining Stephen, the son, as a substitute for himself in the arms of the mother grants him vicarious satisfaction, so resuming sexual rela tions with Molly will grant him the vicarious satisfaction of sexual relations with his daughter, a fantasy that often lurks behind a father's horror at his daughter's sexual maturation. Indeed, we may ask why familial relations in myth seem so confusingly fluid, why daughters bleed into mothers, why sons unseat fathers. One answer must be to give healthy expression through myth (and literature) to incestuous urges that are an undeniable part of human psychology The other answer is that such familial and generational fluidity emphasizes the cyclical continuity of life, which is the message of Eleusis and Joyce's deepest conviction in Ulysses as well. Why does Joyce make the onset of Milly's menstruation occur exactly 9 months and 1 day prior to the events of June 16,1904? The answer could be that after this obvious period of gestation there will be a birth, not an actual child born to Milly but?since mother and daughter are "a single divine substance"?the mythic child that concludes the mysteries at Eleusis, the "divine boy" i.e., Stephen. Indeed, early interpretations of the Eleusinian mysteries were con fused as to which goddess participated in the "Sacred Marriage" and bore the son, Demeter or Persephone. "Reverend Christian scandal mongers/' in Frazer's words, interpreted evidence that Demeter bore her brother Zeus's child as yet another example of pagan barbarity sanctifying incest. Anxious to show that "the marriage to which the Christian writers allude with malicious joy may after all have been of a more regular and orthodox pattern," Frazer reminds us that "Pluto was sometimes known as a god of fertility under the title of Subterranean Zeus." This, added to the fact that Demeter and Persephone were often confused, proves that the ritual is actually "the solemnisation of Persephone's nuptials with her ravisher and 234</page><page sequence="15">husband Pluto" (GB 68). To others less sensitive than Frazer to the thought of an "unorthodox" marriage, it was obvious that both mother and daughter were meant. All sources agree that the hiero phant "by night at Eleusis, accomplishing by the light of a great flame the great and unutterable mysteries, cries in a loud voice 'Holy Brimo has borne a sacred Child, Brimos'"-and the name "Brimo is a form of the Great Mother who is also the Maid" (PSGR 550). Not only are mother and daughter one, but "the lover and the child are but two aspects of the same figure" as well, for Brimos "had other names. In the Homeric hymn he is called Ploutos.. .another man ifestation of Hades," his father (WRE 109). Kerenyi likewise con cludes that just as Brimo is "nondifferentiated mother and daughter.... The child is likewise undifferentiated-it is only what is born, the fruit of birth" (ESM 144). On June 16,1904, both father and son, Bloom and Stephen, conjoin with and are ritually reborn through earth-mother and maiden-daughter. Their experience in the garden at 7 Eccles street is, like Eleusis, a celebration of the "undifferentiated" act of creation. And such a celebration should produce creators?a poet and a father? of its participants. Joyce wittily underscores that "the way to mother" is "through daughter" by portraying Milly/Persephone, symbolized by the cat (L?17.896-908), weaving across Bloom and Stephen's path like an attendant spirit as they "egress" to their final ritual step in the garden (L?17.1032-35). The hierophant leads, carrying his ritual torch, the "Lighted Candle in Stick borne by Bloom," but he leaves the "can dlestick on the floor" (1117.1023-25, 1033). As at Eleusis "the culmination of the whole ritual" was "experienced with doused torches" (PSGR 550; ESM 142). So Bloom and Stephen "emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden" (U17.1037-38), where they experience the "supreme vision," Molly's archetypal apoth eosis, in a brilliant flood of light. At Eleusis, all sources agree, the goddess "flashed upon the experient's soul," "by the light of a great flame," or "in the midst of a great light" (ESM 142; PSGR 550; WRE 107). So in Joyce's paean to Molly /Demeter the "visible luminous sign" appears first to the hierophant, "who attracted Stephen's, gaze" to where "In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom's) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind" (1117.1171-74). Here Joyce ingeniously captures the essence of religious visionary experience, for Molly herself is "invisi ble" yet the initiate actually perceives her in the light which, to the uninitiate, would only be symbolic of her. Bloom, the conscientious hierophant, tries to "elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive 235</page><page sequence="16">person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splen did sign, a lamp" (U17.1177-78), but ultimately words fail. Both men fall into "silent" worship of her and of their own unity in her "theirhisnothis fellowfaces" (LI17.1184)-just as the Eleusinian initi ates gazed in silence at the grain, united in the symbol of the universal continuity of life. The role of the male in creation is not forgotten in the rituals at Eleusis, for the earth-goddess cannot give birth without insemina tion, just as the grain cannot grow unless "fertilising showers quicken the seed in the furrows" (GB 69). So "on the final day of the Mysteries... two vessels called plemochoae are emptied, one towards the east, the other towards the west, and at the moment of outpour ing," "the worshippers looked up to the sky and cried 'Rain!' and then looked down to the earth and cried 'Conceive!'" (PSGR 160; GB 69). Kerenyi adds that the water flowing east and west symbolized the directions of birth and death, "the two aspects of the primal element" (ESM 149). Both aspects exist as well in Bloom and Ste phen's dual aqueous tribute to the goddess, for urine is waste matter or decay, but it also symbolizes semen or new life, and "Joyce's identification of micturition with creativity is well known."32 Signifi cantly this is the first ritual act initiated by Stephen, although as with the communion, both men participate equally: "At Stephen's suggestion, at Bloom's instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated" (L?17.1186-87). Stephen, "hydrophobe" (?117.237), declined involvement in Bloom's ablutions, but he has moved from resistant to submissive to "serious" (?17.369) to fully participatory in this mythic celebration. "What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?" A comet shoots "beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo" (L?17.1210-13), which may symbolize the "Sacred Marriage" between the goddess and her lover?between Molly, suggested (albeit faintly) by the feminine "Tress of Berenice" and Leopold. More important than the marriage, however, was "the holy rite enacted between the hierophant and the chief priestess of Demeter," a "holy congress" shrouded in mystery but resulting in the symbolic birth of a divine son (PSGR 550). Such ritual inter course is enacted by Bloom "inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock" to open the "aper ture" through which Stephen passes (LT17.1215-19). By passing through the garden doorway Stephen is symbolically reborn to finally realize his future as creator. As many critics have discerned and Jean Kimball has recently noted, "the spirit of the artist must participate in the flesh that passes; the word must become 236</page><page sequence="17">flesh... .[an] incarnation [that] can happen only in a woman's womb."33 Through the guidance of his hierophant Stephen has found this maternal archetype in Molly Bloom, goddess of a religion in which physicality and spirituality are one, and he has been reborn through visionary union with her as lover and son. What, in actu ality, will be Stephen's future, Joyce leaves open, but these Eleusi nian parallels suggest an optimistic reading. Ritual union with the earth-mother should lead to creation, for both father and poet. NOTES 1 Virginia Woolf, To the Lighthouse (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1927), pp. 58-59; E.M.

To see ancient rituals as a metaphor for modern psychological states is the next natural step. Scientific demythicizing had become so popular that by 1923, the same year T.S. Eliot praised Joyce's "mythic method," he also bewailed the "curious Freudian-social-mystical-rationalistic-higher-critical interpretation" that had knocked the classics off their "pillar." Archaeology anthropology, "sociology and social psychology," although "of very great value/' had rendered Greek civilization "not much more Olympian" than ours.
