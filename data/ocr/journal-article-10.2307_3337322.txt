Joss Collection at UCLA UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History Los Angeles, California February 28, 1993-May 15, 1994 Reviewed by Rosalinde G. Wilcox Recent visitors to UCLA's Fowler Museum of Cultural History were treated to an exhibition that not only honored the gift of the Jerome L. Joss Collection to the museum but also cele- brated the astonishing diversity of African art. "Sleeping Beauties: African Headrests and Other Highlights from the Jerome L. Joss Collection at UCLA" actually comprised three exhibits featuring 106 objects from different parts of sub-Saharan Africa, 187 neckrests from Africa, Asia, and Oceania, and 48 contempo- rary headrests that resulted from a juried art exhibition sponsored by Mr. Joss. Set against a large wall photograph of the tomb of former Yoruba Chief Lisa of Ondo (Nigeria), an en- trance display of three headrests-from nine- teenth-century Japan, the Kali of Tonga, and the Shona of Zimbabwe-gave only the merest hint of the riches contained within the gallery. Curatorial responsibilities were performed by William Dewey, an art historian at the Uni- versity of Iowa, for the "Sleeping Beauties" sec- tion, and Doran Ross, Deputy director of the Fowler Museum, for the "Other Highlights." The exhibition began with the "Other High- lights." Artworks were organized into five groupings around the gallery perimeter: three broad categories of figural sculpture, masks, and handheld regalia, bracketed by two dis- plays of selected objects produced by the Yoruba and Swahili (Kenya) peoples. Each group was divided into smaller arrangements of several pieces, thereby encouraging the viewer to study a few works at a time. An emerald-green background and large cutout wall photographs relating to an object or an ensemble of exhibited works enhanced each section. A number of small objects displayed in pedestal cases permitted the viewer to circulate freely around the pieces and transformed the large gallery space into a more intimate setting. In selecting the "Highlights" on display, Ross showcased the familiar with the unusual, challenging the viewer to contrast the myriad styles and forms characteristic of sub-Saharan artistic enterprise. Visitors found themselves among quality examples of figurative sculp- ture, such as a wooden Tiv (Nigeria) female fig- ure with elaborately carved facial and abdomi- nal scarification, its neck, knees, and hips adorned with beads. Invited to contemplate the spiritual dimensions of African figural sculp- ture, viewers were informed that this category of Tiv female pedestal figure, known as a mtam, is associated with good marriage and success- Headrest.

Another contrast that distinguished this exhibition demonstrated the various types of materials sub-Saharan artists may use in creating figural sculpture: for exam- ple, a modeled terracotta female figure pro- duced by Dakakari women (northwestern Nigeria) was juxtaposed between the more typ- ical carved wooden versions. A Kongo (Zaire) mintadi nursing an infant represented the mother-and-child sculptural genre. The gem in this grouping, however, was an unusual and exquisite Nsapo Nsapo (south central Zaire) elaborately coiffed and bearded male figure with a much smaller backward-fac- ing female figure on its back. Stylistically both figures are similarly visualized: downcast eyes, prominent foreheads, extravagantly sized feet, and flexed knees that suggest imminent move- ment. The male figure grasps his extended abdomen with both hands; the female echoes the gesture. Besides beard and genitalia, an iron blade piercing the head through the coiffure distinguishes the male. Interpretation of the two images remains inconclusive, but museum notes suggested that the female subsidiary fig- ure represents a guardian spirit or ancestor. No less diverse in form, size, and texture, the masks presented ranged from the familiar Bamana (Mali) roan antelope ci wara headdress, poised as if ready to spring, to a smoothly pol- ished Bassa (Liberia) Naw mask with an elabo- rate coiffure and idealized feminine facial fea- tures; then to a huge, brightly painted Banda (Guinea/Guinea Bissau) headdress composed of selective carved anthropomorphic and zoomorphic elements, and a Sapo (Liberia) judicial mask whose carved wooden core is hidden by an accumulation of tusks, teeth, veg- etal and raffia fibers, animal hair, cowrie shells, cc 0 w ! 0) o Y o i o. 0 cc 0 U.

Intended to terrorize, this mask's power is made manifest not only by its accreted visage but also, no doubt, by its aroma. "Other Highlights" also provoked compar- isons of the numerous types of objects that denote high status and social prestige among cultures across the sub-Saharan landscape such as adzes, staffs, and large carved household utensils. A wooden pindi charm figure from the Mbala (Zaire) representing a female diviner, replete with a prestigious adze slung over her left shoulder, and playing her slit drum, com- manded my attention. A wall photograph depicted a northern Yaka female diviner simi- larly posed, playing a slit drum. This mirroring made both figures all the more compelling, each documenting the other as a viable portrait image. The diviner is the principal problem solver among the Mbala peoples. Pindi charms acquire their power and significance as part of a Mbala lineage chief's sacred regalia. The Yoruba and east African Swahili dis- plays occasioned the most reflection. The obvi- ous contrast was the emphasis on figural rep- resentation in the former and its virtual absence in the latter, notably demonstrated in architectural carvings: two Yoruba houseposts by master carver Obembe Alaye, dating from the nineteenth century, and eighteenth-centu- ry Swahili door posts from Siyu and lintels from Lamu Island.

Both types marked the owner's social status. The most striking comparison was the cultural significance of sacred wisdom and the devotion given to its visual presentation. A Siyu Koran from the early nineteenth century, written in flowing calligraphy, had brightly colored medallions and floral borders that lav- ishly illuminated its pages. But to the Swahili scribes and illuminators, decorative programs extended beyond the purely aesthetic and assisted the reader by highlighting particular texts and stressing correct rhythm, pauses, and phrases. A Yoruba Ifa divination tray resem- bling a tray on a stand was equally impressive. Its carefully carved and conceived images, designed to receive the words of the gods and ancestors, evoke the Yoruba world view. Birds, interlace patterns, bows and arrows, and male and female figures, among others, flank a face that is often interpreted as Esu/Elegba, and ornament the tray's raised edge. The stand consists of openwork carving of fish-legged figures, interlace patterns, and male and female figures relating to the Yoruba cosmos. The ornamented surfaces of both the Siyu. Koran and the Yoruba divination tray become vehicles that not only receive and present sacred text but also grace and honor it. From the Islamic east African display, the visitor then passed through a large portal shaped like a headrest and entered the "Sleep- ing Beauties" space. There Dewey arranged the headrests, most of which originated from east, central, and southern Africa, geographically in wall cases, with smaller displays for Oceanic and Asian examples. The azure blue walls com- plemented the warm wood tones of the head- rests, and large wall photographs contextual- ized their use. Two freestanding cases permit- ted close-up inspection. Headrests are small objects of domestic fur- niture that have endured for centuries. To illus- trate this point, the exhibit commenced with two elegant wooden examples from ancient Egypt dating from the Old (ca. 2600 B.C.) and New (ca. 1500 B.C.) Kingdoms. Three Joss col- lection headrests from sub-Saharan Africa, believed to have been in use between the elev- enth and thirteenth centuries, conform to those excavated from Tellem culture burial sites in the caves of Mali's Bandiagara escarpment. In his catalogue Dewey sets the record straight by using the nomenclature "head- rest" rather than the more familiar "neckrest," citing as his reason the manner in which these objects are used by their creators (p. 16). He tells us that rather than supporting the back of the head at the base of the neck, the rest, according to the majority of his informants, was placed under one ear and along the side of the chin to support the head. This seems to have been the preferred manner of using the headrest throughout sub-Saharan Africa. These "rigid pillows" generally follow a basic shape: two horizontal pieces-one curved to cradle the head, the other flat for a base- separated by a vertical support and typically carved from a single piece of wood. Yet they exhibit amazing variety within this form. Some, such as the smoothly polished Ethiopian versions, are exquisite in their stark simplicity. Others are carefully ornamented with beads, woven raffia, reptile leather, and upholstery tacks; or embellished with carved geometric patterns and figurative sculpture. The Rendille peoples (Kenya), however, make headrests that defy the generic label. Preferring headrests of zoomorphic shapes, they select branches that exhibit the potential for such forms. As the wall and display texts acknowl- edged, sub-Saharan headrests appear to have been restricted by gender early in their history. Tellem headrests found in conjunction with male skeletons have been associated with male status.

They support elab- orate coiffures that indicate age and gender. A mud cap of the Rendille or Pokot people and a photograph illustrating their appearance dem- onstrated this functional necessity. In Kenya and Uganda, elegant headrests with precari- ously thin legs remain unadorned for the uninitiated, but are enhanced with beads for initiated males. According to Dewey, headrests are invita- tions to the spirits to enter into dreams and operate as conduits to the ancestors. Unlike American insomniacs who ingest their sleep- ing potions, their Zairian counterparts often attach apotropaic and medicinal substances to their headrests. Elaborated headrests are con- ducive to dreams of wealth, others serve as guardians watching over their owners, and some perform double duty as strongboxes. Longer than most, Swazi and Zulu (South Africa) headrests allude to cattle, important to economic, political, and cosmological systems; the carved projections represent heads, horns, and tails. Among the Shona (Zimbabwe), important men are buried "sleeping" on carv- ings. Today, ancestral communication is best received by chiefs and diviners while dream- ing on a headrest, which assists in acquiring specialized knowledge for settling disputes and determining where animals can be hunted. There is something appealingly intimate about these objects. Perhaps it is their size and the miniaturization of forms usually seen in larger scale. This is most obvious in Zairian headrests which frequently have carved female supports depicted with elaborate scar- ification patterns and coiffures. A Hemba headrest was one outstanding example. Asian headrests are correlated with pres- tige and protection, like the blue and white porcelain "pillow" from China produced between the seventeenth and nineteenth cen- turies. Animal motifs, such as the lion, that ward off dangerous spirits are associated with distinguished careers and high social status. Melanesian headrests are also status markers and bring their owners in closer contact with spiritual beliefs. Recognizing the tactile quality of the head- rests and anticipating viewer curiosity about their comfort index, the co-curators construct- ed a demonstration area including two beds and several headrests where visitors could con- duct their own "heads-on" experiments. I did not observe any converts from our soft pillow equivalents, but a few expressed surprise that a headrest could be quite comfortable. The third gallery space contained the results of the Fowler-Joss challenge to create an original headrest constructed of any material "that is both artistically compelling and func- tional" and also "reflects the artist's personal aesthetic or cultural background." The compe- tition comprised four divisions-middle school, high school, college, and open (adult). Remarkably, there were over 600 entries, the most distant being a copper-wire chameleon headrest from South Africa. The materials and designs ranged from the whimsical-a soft-form headrest of stuffed bears evoking the artist's childhood-to the nostalgic-a rigid-pillow acrylic house for trea- sured memories. Others displayed an elegant use of everyday materials; for example, one was made of a steel rod with the center area wrapped in colored rubber bands. Several designs contained literary and musical references. One was Gulliver's Pillow, obviously slept on judging by the indentation in this glazed clay form. The impression was that of a Gulliver long gone, leaving a pillow that continues to overwhelm the surrounding little people struggling to capture it. Another piece, a jazzy Mr. Joplin Takes Five, its surface curved to accommodate repose between rags, african arts * autumn 1994 77</page><page sequence="3">was constructed of piano keys and supported by piano stool feet. Responding to the request to conceptualize their own identities and realities, one entrant submitted a clay replica of a graffitied wall called My Reality, which boldly exhorted the nappers/passersby to "relax." We Sisters Three, composed of two plaster female faces in red and gold separated by a curved area for the head, derived inspiration from the Edgar Allen Poe short story "The Masque of the Red Death." The artist commemorated in her head- rest the oldest of three sisters who died of com- plications from AIDS. More than the sum of its parts, "Sleeping Beauties" demonstrated the diversity of form and materials within a single type, made the connection between artifact and context, and illuminated significant ideas about the objects predicated on informed scholarship. The exhi- bition demonstrated the Fowler's continuing commitment and accessibility to a broad pub- lic, this time in visual terms. Not only did the competition inspire the creativity of the en- trant-artists, but their efforts touched our imag- inations. Lastly, "Sleeping Beauties" publicly acknowledged the energetic force and gener- ous presence of Jerome L. Joss, a successful advertising executive from Chicago now living in Los Angeles, who unselfishly tailored most of his collection with the museum's needs in mind. He has enriched all of us.
