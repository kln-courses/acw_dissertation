(Plato Rep. 561E) The first part of this essay defines and describes more fully the psycho- logical phenomenon mentioned in the title, indicating the range of its manifestations in Greek life and literature. The second part (pp. 410 ff) illustrates the matter concretely and points out its bearing upon certain problems of literary interpretation. If modern habits of mind were the same as those of the pre-Socratic Greeks, we should not often err in the interpreta- tion of their literature and thought; but since the psycho- logical differences between them and us are considerable, it frequently happens that modern critics, too much influenced by their own patterns of thought, either find something in early Greek literature that is not there, or else are puzzled and even disappointed by not finding there something which they feel ought to be there. Since this is so, it behooves us as interpreters to keep in view at all times, and in many different connections, those particular characteristics of the early Greek mind which can be recognized as such, and which stand in contrast to modern ways of thinking. I am about to describe and illustrate what I conceive to be one of those fundamental characteristics- a Greek way of looking at things which is quite familiar, to be sure, in many of its separate manifestations, but which deserves to be recognized more clearly than it has been, and to be conceived in broader perspective, considering that the failure to recognize its appli- cation in specific instances has often resulted in the raising of unnecessary problems (with a resultant crop of false solutions), or in a simple lack of understanding.</page><page sequence="2">404 Ben Edwin Perry [1937 The title chosen for this paper is not quite adequate. What I have in mind might be further indicated by such captions as 'the occasional disregard of logical, moral, or aesthetic se- quence in early literature,' or 'the triumph of parataxis over hypotaxis in thought as well as in grammar,' or 'immediacy of interest in the early Greek mind,' or, more fully still, 'the capacity for contemplating only one thing or one aspect of a thing or person at one time, purely for its own interest and without regard to the ulterior implications or associations that an early Greek narrator might indeed be concerned about, but often is not, and that a modern person with his more schematic habits of mind would almost inevitably bring in. I find abundant illustration of this in the language, mythology, religion, and life, as well as in the literature of early Greece. In the sixth book of the Iliad, for example, the meeting between Diomedes and Glaucus is described at length in a spirit of the highest ethical idealism, but that does not prevent the poet from adding at the end what seems to us the dis- concerting and incongruous remark that Glaucus was a fool for allowing Diomedes to get the better of him in the trade of armor. We are startled by this sudden transition from the poetic to the comic and shrewdly materialistic aspect of the same transaction, by the fact that Glaucus appears first as a hero and then as a simpleton. The fancy of a modern poet, and indeed that of Homer himself on another occasion, would have been so dominated by the ideal aspect of the preceding scene, and by the heroic personality of the actors, that he would have continued to the end in the same spirit; in other words, he would have been governed by a very common yet conscious and literary principle of aesthetic or artistic unity which in this episode is conspicuously ignored. Why is it ignored? Because, I believe, the poet's mind is here function- ing in a purely natural and unrestrained fashion. He con- templates in succession two very different aspects of the same act, the second of which is mentioned solely for its own</page><page sequence="3">Vol. lxviii] Viewing Things Separately 405 interest and in spite of the fact that for us it is artistically incongruous with the first. The succession of thoughts and images in the human mind is not regulated by considerations of logic or choice; they present themselves automatically one after the other in re- sponse to various incidental and immediate stimuli, and with- out regard to uniformity of any kind. There are more con- tradictions in nature than in any kind of art. The actual record of what passed through the mind of a normal person in a single day would be something extremely chaotic. But of course what goes on in the mind on the one hand, and what is actually uttered or written on the other, though closely connected, are different things; it is quite unlikely that we have any record of thought from the past that is as absolutely spontaneous as Joyce's Ulysses purports to be. Probably the nearest approach to such extreme naturalness is made in the primitive folk tale, where there is a maximum of objectivity and of paratactical arrangement, and a minimum of person- ality, morality, sentiment, cause and effect, aesthetic uni- formity, or other kinds of inner coherence. In such tales the narrator, as a rule, merely describes what he sees or imagines without making inferences or being conscious of kindred ideas. When he does become conscious of such ideas he mentions them. The primitive mind resembles the mind of a child in that it occupies itself with the object immediately before it rather than with anything more remote. "When you point your finger at something across the room," says a recent commentator on the magician's art, "an adult looks in the direction you indicate, but a child looks first at your finger." I Such immediacy is typical, in kind if not in degree, of adult psychology at an early stage of cultural development. At the opposite extreme, on the other hand, stands the ever conscious literary artist, the typically modern writer or thinker who has inherited some twenty-three centuries of doctrine about life and art, and who, working in opposition to nature, 1 Fred C. Kelly, " Nothing up the Sleeve" in Reader's Digest, Sept. 1937, 95.</page><page sequence="4">406 Ben Edwin Perry [1937 and with a relatively wide perspective, chooses, arranges, and subordinates his conceptions one to the other. Such a nar- rator, unlike the primitive or purely spontaneous story teller, and incidentally unlike Homer in the passage above men- tioned, will not allow his interest in the thing immediately before him to interfere with the larger synthesis upon which he is intent. For him the implications of an action are usually more important than the action itself; he dares not proceed in a purely disinterested, objective, impersonal and paratactical fashion, describing only what he sees or imagines, like the teller of the folk tale, lest by so doing his story should inculcate a wrong attitude toward something, lest he ascribe the wrong feelings or the wrong morals to the characters out of which he thinks, or lest he make these characters, or his episodes, in some way inconsistent or incongruous. In his work or thought everything tends to have meaning in terms of personality, or morality, or sentiment, or philosophical belief, or all of these combined; and these elements must, moreover, be brought into harmony with the writer's conscious artistic ideals. In all these respects the typically modern- one might say the Platonic mind-differs sharply both from the primitive mind as revealed in folklore and mythology, and to a great extent also, and in the same way, from the contemporary mind at those rare moments when the latter, temporarily off guard, happens to be functioning in a purely spontaneous way. I have described two psychological extremes, which for momentary convenience may be called the 'primitive' and the 'artificial' respectively; my point is that in respect to the habit of drawing inferences and of always taking associated ideas into account, the type of mind manifested in many ways and in varying degrees by the Greek writers before Socrates,2 represents an intermediate stage of evolution be- 2 That is, before philosophy was commonly recognized as a guide to life for individual men. The thought of Plato and his followers, in so far as it relates to ethics and to man in his environment, is far more ideal and schematic than that of earlier philosophers or of Thucydides. I do not mean to imply, however,</page><page sequence="5">Vol. lxviii] Viewing Things Separately 407 tween the primitive and the artificial-in the sense in which I am using these terms. In other words, the early Greek mind is mature but has as yet nothing in excess; it has much of the childlike in it, i.e. much of the natural, but not enough to merit the epithet 'naive,' for it is rich in the simple wisdom of experience; it is neither primitive nor beset with artificial complexes, neither averse to logic nor, like Plato, forever dominated by it; not really unmoral, yet certainly not obsessed by the moral outlook: it can be very moral or very logical on occasion, but neither attitude is habitual. Within the limits that a Greek artist sets for himself he is guided by a fine sense of measure and of form, but those limits can be more restricted than modern taste expects them to be, and so we often look for, or assume the presence of, a background that is not in the picture and was not meant to be. Looking at the matter in a slightly different way, the Hellenic temperament is extremely versatile and manysided. It is wont to enjoy, contemplate, or deify by turns, and with a remarkable intensity, directness, and truthfulness in each case, everything in experience good or bad that naturally pertains to man; but while it gives play to every side of human nature, it does not allow any one side to tyrannize over or interfere with the others. In that respect the early Hellenic temperament differs from our own; for we are system-ridden and are constantly subordinating one idea or image to another to which we have given superior authority, whereas in the early Greek mind all ideas and images tend to remain, as in the childhood of the race, free and independent. That is the case in religion, where polytheism, tolerant by nature, deifies the most varied and opposite types of human experience without ever allowing one cult to interfere with another; it that the phenomenon in question ceases to exist after the fifth century; on the contrary there are many evidences of it in Xenophon, especially in the Hellenika and in the Anabasis, and the average Greek, even at a much later period, was always versatile and paratactic, so to speak, by instinct-quem vis hominem secum adtulit ad nos (Juv. Sat. 3.75). But in literature, generally speaking, this phenomenon is not very noticeable after the fifth century.</page><page sequence="6">408 Ben Edwin Perry [1937 is the case, moreover, in mythology, with its innumerable contradictions and its disregard of character and morality through preoccupation with the al'Trov; 3 it is the case in early Greek literature, where the old myths and traditions are handled from a poetic, dramatic, or purely intellectual stand- point without being interpreted, or even thought of, in terms of the contemporary social or moral outlook, where one aspect of a character or of an action is dealt with intensively to the exclusion of other aspects that a modern reader is accustomed to find in similar contexts, where irony-which views things coordinately, disinterestedly, and objectively-prevails in place of satire, so common in later times, in which the author, as pleader of a cause, ridicules something because it does not fit in with his ideal system,4 and where such authors as Homer and Herodotus show more interest in the man than in the cause he represents and concentrate their artistic efforts more upon the episode per se than upon the connection be- tween one episode and another, or upon the effect of the sum 3 Grote in his History of Greece (Everyman edition i 76) refers to the myth of Io as "one of the numerous tales which the fancy of the Greeks deduced from the amorous dispositions of Zeus and the jealousy of Hera." Now the analogy of similar stories about Zeus may have helped at the birth of this one, but most mythologists would agree, I think, that the character of Zeus and Hera was not the starting point from which this myth was "deduced," as Grote implies; rather the myth was told in order to explain something in the history of the cult of Hera, while "character" is something that results only for the modern or later mind. The myth-maker is oblivious to character. He thinks of the gods only as actors with plausible human motives. Their morals are assumed to be no better and no worse than those of the normal human being. Given the opportunities for love-making that Zeus had, any man would pre- sumably behave in about the same way on any one occasion. The "erotic propensity" of Zeus is not an individual peculiarity, nor is there any cynicism or implied condemnation in the assumption that such conduct is normal. Moreover, the number of instances in which Zeus was supposed to have made love to a mortal woman was not so present to the mind of the myth-maker as it is to us, who peruse classical dictionaries. Like many other modern students, Grote cannot refrain from introducing considerations of character into a realm where they do not belong. 4 Satire is foreign to tragedy; like the representation of individuals in drama it belongs properly to comedy. Euripides helped the downfall of tragedy by introducing both.</page><page sequence="7">Vol. lxviii] Viewing Things Separately 409 total of episodes; and finally, to pass over geography, politics, and freedom of speech, we find a similar independence in the Greek language itself, whose syntax, not to mention the rule- defying variety of its morphology and accent, shows a marked fondness for coordination rather than subordination, espe- cially in the early period. Nor should we leave philosophy entirely out of account. The attempt of pre-Socratic thinkers to explain the physical universe in terms of a single principle or substance, thereby following logic in defiance of sense perception, ended by committing hybris in the form of the Eleatic monism, and was promptly followed by a reassertion of the reality of the Many in the form of Atomism, which was Greek philosophy's final answer to the riddle of the physical universe. In the field of ethics and metaphysics Plato's idealism has much in common with the Eleatic system, since it follows logic and language beyond experience and tends to find reality in the One rather than in the Many. It was natural therefore that Plato should explicitly condemn certain forms of pluralism and immediacy which were rooted in the instincts of his countrymen and widely manifested in the everyday life and thought of the average Hellene. Thus he objects to the 0AXoOcad/uwv avx'p who recognizes beauty only in a multitude of different perceptions and who refuses to admit the existence of the one absolute and perfect beauty.5 His "democratic man," to whom he applies the noteworthy adjective Icrovo,ILKoS, is such as to " make no distinction between his pleasures, but to suffer himself to be led by the passing pleasure which chance throws in his way, and to turn to another when the first is satisfied-scorning none but fostering all alike. . . . Hence he lives from day to day to the end, in the gratification of the casual appetite, now drinking himself drunk to the sound of music, and presently putting himself under training, sometimes idling and neglecting everything, and then living like a student of philosophy. Often he takes part in public affairs, and starting up, speaks and acts accord- 5 Plato Rep. 479a.</page><page sequence="8">410 Ben Edwin Perry [1937 ing to the impulse of the moment. Now he follows eagerly in the steps of certain great generals, because he covets their distinctions, and anon he takes to trade, because he envies the successful trader. And there is no order or constraining rule in his life; but he calls this life of his pleasant, and liberal, and happy, and follows it out to the end." 6 Here is written in large letters, in the life and conduct of an imaginary but typical Greek, that quality of soul which reveals itself in varying degrees and aspects in almost every product of the early Greek mind. After Plato we might call it icoovojtia, intellectual isonomy, as it were. On the positive side this means the habit of looking at different things one at a time with about equal interest in each; on the negative side, more important for us, the capacity to view one thing by itself without letting another interfere. This psychological condition underlies and explains a wide variety of artistic, especially literary, phenomena. We recognize it most readily of course when it appears in outstanding peculiarities of syntax, or in the composition of short sections of text as in the story of Glaucus and Diomedes cited above; but we must also recognize it in the general attitude of the early poets, historians and dramatists. It may condition an entire work of art, or it may give us the key to understanding one part of a literary work in comparison with another part of the same work that seems contradictory, or it may give us the proper perspective for viewing two different works by the same author. Moreover, different authors have different de- grees of it and may reveal it in different ways. I pass now to illustrations. II Since epic poety is oral in origin and early, its syntax and style of composition are consequently more spontaneous and less logical in many respects than the syntax and style of later authors. Anacoluthon and various forms of parataxis are 6 Plato Rep. 561b-d, as syncopated and translated by R. W. Livingstone, The Greek Genius and its Meaning to Us3 (Oxford Univ.

If modern scholars can err in as simple a matter as this, by being too logical, how much more likely are they to err through failure to recognize the same paratactic principle when it applies to the interpretation of literature.</page><page sequence="10">412 Ben Edwin Perry [1937 Iliad 3.59-67: "EKTOP, E7rE1 /LE KaC' aTcLav ciEVELKErCoas ov3' iv7rp ato-av, atcIE TOL Kpabl 7rEXKEKVUS s C-rTLV &amp;tpns . . . vvv avT EtL u EXELs. In the Cbrd' clause Paris gives the reason for the concession to Hector that he intends to make and finally does make eight lines below; meanwhile several other thoughts suggested suc- cessively by EiVKEK-oaS and by &amp;2pa (64) have been uttered independently.9 Odyssey 6.262 ff, as translated by Butcher and Lang: "But when we set foot within the city-whereby goes a high wall with towers, and there is a fair haven on either side of the town; and narrow is the entrance," etc. The description continues and the apodosis is completely forgotten.'0 The examples above quoted are typical of a great deal in the syntax and style of the Homeric poems, where the Xctts dpo&amp;Ev77, the strung-along style, appears in the most pronounced form known to Greek literature. Spontaneous absorption with what happens to be uppermost in the mind of the poet (his audience, or his character) at the moment, leads the narrator to disregard all logical syntax and to treat as inde- pendent that which, either by the nature of the case or by normal grammatical usage, is dependent. As in informal speech, where there is no striving for logically constructed periods and paragraphs, so too in the Xctts dtpolu4vmq, successive thoughts tend to be uttered one after the other as soon as they come to mind, each one being suggested by the one that precedes; and while the narrator is occupied with one of these (@.9Cf. Od. 4.204-212, 6.187-191, 17.185-190; D. B. Monro, Homeric Grammar2 (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1891), 324, b and c. 10 With such passages in mind (cf. II. 6.242-51; 18.101 ff, 22.111 ff), we may hesitate to regard as interpolated even the 70-line episode inserted at the dra- matic moment in the Odyssey (19.386 ff) when Eurycleia recognizes Odysseus by the scar on his thigh; the temptation to digress on the history of the scar as soon as it was mentioned may have been strong enough to cause the poet to ignore everything else even for the space of 70 lines-like the Scythian army in Herodotus (4.134) that was all ready to join battle with the Persians and would have done so immediately, had they not stopped to chase a rabbit.</page><page sequence="11">Vol. lxviii] Viewing Things Separately 413 thoughts he takes little heed of the others. There is con- tinuity or rather concatenation of thought almost everywhere. In contrast to the periodic style, which is post-Socratic, there is very little subordinating of one idea to another; like the links in a chain each tends to have equal value and to be equally detachable from the whole. The same immediacy of interest, with its resulting coordina- tion of ideas, reveals itself not only in Homeric syntax but in many other features of style, composition, and arrangement of episodes." To dwell on these at length would be to mis- "1 Cf. S. E. Bassett, Harvard Studies in Classical Philology xxx (1920), 39-53, on the wide application in Homer of the principle of composition known as V5repov 7rp6TEpoV, which tends to defy strict logic in the interest of immediacy and continuity. As concerns the broader features of composition both in Homer and in other early authors, the case has been so well stated by J. Tate (C.R. LI 174f) in his summary of B. A. Van Groningen's recent essay, Para- tactische compositie in de oudste Grieksche literatuur (Amsterdam 1937) that I venture to quote his words at length. Mr. Tate says: " Plato demanded that a literary work should have the unity of a living organism; the parts should be consistent with one another and subordinate to the whole. This demand springs from the new rhetoric, which was all for rule and system. The 'pre- classical' method of composition was not organic or hypotactic but paratactic. The 'parts' tend to be autonomous, and the 'whole' is not a genuine whole but a 'dossier.' Such 'wholes' have neither true beginning nor true end. They are arbitrarily chosen portions of larger 'wholes' (as the Iliad, itself episodic, is only an episode in the Trojan War). And this is true even if the whole piece be 'framed' or 'boxed' with prologue and epilogue; for these mark no essential delimitation of the subject-matter. The unity-if there be unity in such a work-is due to the fact that the essentially disparate parts are ingeniously stitched together by devices such as recurring lines, transitions, echoes and foreshadowings. Professor Van Groningen draws support from Alcman's Partheneion, the Hymn to Apollo, Hesiod, Xenophanes (who actually begins a poem with a transitional line), and, above all, Semonides, who is revealed by his poem on women as a master of the paratactic technique. What then of the Iliad and the Odyssey? The characteristic features of paratactic composition are to be found in both poems. Homer's aim is the perfection of the parts rather than the integrity of the whole; he thinks more of variety and abundance than of qualitative selection and the orderly disposition of the parts. To attack the unity of either poem because of the paratactic features, or to defend their unity on the ground that each is an organic and well-knit structure, betrays a concern for literary canons which are irrelevant in the field of pre- classical Greek literature. . . . Perhaps, as literature develops, organic pattern is increasingly superimposed on sheer agglutinative parataxis."</page><page sequence="12">414 Ben Edwin Perry [1937 direct the emphasis of the present essay, which is concerned primarily not with external features of composition, except in so far as these reveal a certain quality of mind, but rather with the attitude of early writers toward the things they describe. From this point of view let us consider for a moment the Homeric simile. It is a familiar fact that the poet is not always content to illustrate just the particular point for which the comparison is made; often, through concentration upon the image before him, he adds details that have nothing to do with the narrative and which do not belong logically in the comparison.'2 He can dwell upon B without at the same time thinking of A. Moreover, the analogy between A and B is at times so narrowly restricted that to the modern mind, accustomed to see things in a wider or a different perpsective, the simile may seem quaint or undignified. Thus when Homer compares the gathering Achaeans to flies swarming about the pails of milk in a stable (Iliad 2.469), he is thinking primarily of their numbers and restless movement; but the modern reader, subconsciously expanding the analogy, is likely to take more notice of the incongruity between flies and heroes. And so it is when we find the valiant Ajax likened to a stubborn ass which the boys are cudgelling in vain, in their effort to drive him from the cornfield (Iliad 11.558), or when the Trojan elders are compared to cicadas (Iliad 3.151), or when Athena inspires Menelaus with the courage of a fly (Iliad 17.570). In such cases the modern mind is conscious of associations that are not present for the Greek.-3 12 One would think that this could hardly escape the attention of any Greek student; and yet Professor L. E. Lord (Class. Jour. xviii 73-81), finding the same thing at the end of the book of Jonah, fails to recognize it, though he searches Greek literature for a parallel. The biblical passage in question reads as follows: "And should I not spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than six score thousand persons who cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle?" 13 The tendency to ignore in a simile everything except a very special point of likeness (which may be merely the general quality of excellence) is more pronounced in early Hebrew poetry than in Greek; cf. Song of Solomon 1.9:</page><page sequence="13">Vol. lxviii] Viewing Things Separately 415 Concentration of interest upon the individual, without regard to the public cause in which he is enlisted, is another important feature of the Homeric outlook. It matters little to Homer whether a man is fighting to save Troy or to destroy it; he finds nobility, beauty, tragedy, human interest on both sides; and that is all he cares about. But the case is very different in Vergil's Aeneid, for there the larger scheme of things with its strong patriotic bias is always before us, dominating and overshadowing the man. In contrast to Vergil, Homer's outlook is more restricted, immediate, and human in any one part, more manifold in range of interest throughout, and more independent of standardized patterns of thought. In commenting upon the lay of Ares and Aphrodite in the eighth book of the Odyssey, a typical modern student observes: "There is nothing funny about marital infidelity." No, but there is something funny about being caught in the act, as Ares was, and it is amusing to reflect with Hermes and Apollo that Hephaestus' triumph was somewhat more than dubious. Homer is not concerned with the concept "marital infidelity." He is picturing an act, without reference to its social or moral implications-a thing that few moderns, when on their dignity, are capable of doing. For Homer it was easy and natural to do so, partly because those social and moral ideas were by no means so all-important in the minds of his contemporaries as they are for us, and partly because, however much he might deprecate adultery as such if the proposition were put to him in that light, he is nevertheless in the habit of viewing one thing, or only one aspect of one thing, at a time. As he can neglect elementary logic in his syntax and similes, so he can neglect social and moral considerations when he happens, " I have compared thee, 0 my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots; " ibid. 7.4: " Thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus." I assume that some kind of excellence other than size is here in point; or were very large noses considered beautiful by the ancient Hebrews?</page><page sequence="14">416 Ben Edwin Perry [1937 as often, to be interested in something else. In order to fit Homer into the procrustean bed of his Christian morality (many are inclined that way), Professor F. P. Donnelly 14 declares it noteworthy that "Homer's worst lapse in story- telling takes place among the luxurious Phaeacians, ancient prototypes of degeneracy. Homer may have felt justified artistically because he was depicting the non-Grecian world through whose monsters," etc. More hypotactic interpreta- tion! Homer needed no justification other than the delight of his Greek audience in the story per se. Odysseus and Homer as well as the Phaeacians were charmed with it (line 368), and the episode ends with dignity and unusual beauty: And fast away fled she, Aphrodite, lover of laughter, to Cyprus over the sea, To the pleasant shores of Paphos, and the incensed altar-stone, Where the Graces washed her body, and shed sweet balm thereon, Ambrosial balm that shineth on the gods that wax not old, And wrapped her in lovely raiment, a wonder to behold.'5 In general there are two different attitudes towards the gods in Homer, and neither is felt to be incompatible with the other; the gods are viewed either as actors in a drama, where they must be anthropomorphic, or as powers to be propitiated and prayed to by men. In relation to men they are objects of reverent concern, but when viewed in relation to each other, and as actors in a drama, they have all the normal characteristics, including the weaknesses, of humankind. As there will ordinarily be squabbling among human beings when, in spite of conflicting interests,'6 they try to live together in a big family, so very naturally we find the same situation among the anthropomorphic gods on Olympus. But in Homer -as in primitive folk tales, as in old Attic comedy, as in the Hymn to Hermes, and as in the parallel cultivation of religion 14 As quoted in Class. Weekly XIX (1926), 92. With what Professor Donnelly has to say in this article concerning individualism in art I am in hearty accord; but that is something else. 15 Od. 8.362 ff, as translated by J. W. Mackail. 16 These were probably suggested to some extent by the facts of cult history.</page><page sequence="15">Vol. lxviii] Viewing Things Separately 417 and divine mythology the world over17- the reverent may stand side by side with the ridiculous or grotesque, while both attitudes remain perfectly sincere and neither is impaired by the proximity of the other. Here again the analogy of para- taxis in Homeric syntax and composition gives us the right perspective. And yet this perspective, to which I have been pointing throughout as profoundly characteristic of the early Greek mind in general, and as manifested concretely in many different ways, is completely disregarded by those numerous Homeric critics, Murray included, who believe that the comic or grotesque scenes on Mount Olympus are conceived in a spirit of mockery, that they are "consciously satirical or doctrinal, connected with the skepticism of Ionian philosophy, distinguishable from other, earlier parts of the text in which the gods are objects of reverent faith, or useful to the higher critic in his attempts to identify the work of different poets in different periods." 18 The task of demolishing these artificial theories wherein Homer, or a certain type of Homeric inter- polator, is conceived as an early Greek philosopher "mit 17 Cf. G. M. Calhoun, A.J.P. LVIII 266f, who refers to Andrew Lang's Myth, Ritual and Religion and adds (note 20): "More recent studies have made additions to the data without materially altering their general character or impairing the value of Lang's conclusions in regard to the conflict between religion and myth, between the 'mood of earnest contemplation and submission' and the mood of 'playful and erratic fancy' both of them 'present and in conflict, through the whole religious history of the human race."' The conflict however, is far more apparent to the modern or Platonic mind than to the isonomic mind and temperament of early, natural, or polytheistic man. In the Frogs Aristophanes can burlesque Dionysus and do him honor and worship at the same time. And so it is to some extent in the Hymn to Hermes. Con- sider the following remarks by J. A. K. Thomson, Irony (Cambridge, Harv. Univ. Press, 1927), 72: "For the average ancient man piety consisted in be- lieving in the gods and propitiating them with the appropriate ceremonies and sacrifices. To believe in the goodness of God was not an essential tenet in his creed at all. Consequently he did not greatly care what people said about the gods. as long as they did not deny their existence or their power. Of course, a Plato or an Aristotle may raise the point of the divine omnipotence or omnis- cience. But the Dramatists were not writing for the philosopher; they were writing for the average Athenian. for whom the important question was the practical, not the moral, one." 18 Calhoun op. cit. (see note 17), 257.</page><page sequence="16">418 Ben Edwin Perry [1937 durchdachter Weltanschauung" (Finsler), may well be left to Professor Calhoun, who has already effectively pointed out how unhistorical they are. The Greek mood or point of view may shift suddenly and frequently; hence the endless variety of Homer, Herodotus, and Aristophanes, the unrestricted, rapid-fire imagery of Aeschylus and Pindar-and their anacolutha. In commenting on Pindar, Gildersleeve remarks: "And so Pindar's metaphors are slides that come out in such quick succession that the figures seem to blend because the untrained eye cannot follow the rapid movement of the artist. . . . In such passages the absence of conjunctions is sufficient to show that no connec- tion was aimed at, and it is the fault of the reader if he chooses to complain of an incongruous blending of things that are left apart." 19 In regard to the preservation of parataxis in syntax and composition Herodotus, loosely speaking, seems to stand about midway between Homer and Isocrates, though in many re- spects he is closer to Homer. Like the Iliad, his History is episodic and held together only by a loosely unifying plan; and like Homer he is more interested in close-up views of the careers and actions of individual men than in the historical significance of those actions, or in the implications that they may have for either individual or national honor. How dif- ferent this outlook is from the normal outlook of men in later times, especially such as lean to Platonism, may be seen from Plutarch's essay On the Malignity of Herodotus. As a tender- minded idealist with strong convictions about right and wrong and the glory of ancient Greece, Plutarch assumes that every- thing mentioned by the historian must have been thought of primarily in relation to the same ideals, and that for Herodotus, as for himself, everything in history that can be looked upon as good or bad is, if mentioned, merely a testimonial concerning the honor or dishonor of the men involved. Accordingly he 19 B. L. Gildersleeve, Pindar, The Olympian and Pythian Odes2 (New York, Ameiican Book Co., 1890) xliv.</page><page sequence="17">Vol. lxviii] Viewing Things Separately 419 scolds Herodotus and accuses him of deliberate malice when- ever the latter reports anything that may, by his way of thinking, detract from the glory of the ancient Greeks. He cannot understand that Herodotus is interested only in the fact per se as he believed it to be, and that the inferences and character-concepts which are so important for himself and others like him, are either not present to the mind of Herodotus at all, or if present are of far less concern. Plutarch's criticism of Herodotus resembles the strictures of Dionysius of Hali- carnassus on the history of Thucydides, concerning which old Thomas Hobbes remarks: "I think there never was written so much absurdity in so few lines." 20 Although modern critics are able to overcome the patriotic bias that vitiates the judgment of such men as Plutarch and Dionysius, many of them nevertheless err in the same way through inability to overcome the moral, philosophical, or sentimental bias. They have a habit of putting together things that were viewed sepa- rately, and without perturbation, in the more natural outlook of the early Greek authors. Many events and descriptions in the history of Herodotus are recorded in the same, to us peculiar, spirit of detachment that characterizes the so-called Ionian novella-those vivid tales of action born of the primitive and still unfettered human spirit, wherein things are depicted in their most imme- diate, objective aspect, without regard for social or moral prejudices or for the aesthetic conventions that dominate later art. If there is art in these Xo&amp;yot, it is not quite what we ordinarily mean by that term; rather it is the ease and skill in straightforward narration developed by generations of racon- teurs endowed with the Homeric (and primitive) instinct for directness and immediacy. To the temper of Herodotus this 20 The English Works of Thomas Hobbes (London, John Bohn, 1843) VIII, xxvi. In the passage to which Hobbes refers (Ad Cn. Pomp. 3.4-9), Dionysius complains that Thucydides chose the wrong war to write about, and that, if he must write about that disastrous affair, he should at least have found some way to put the blame for it on others, instead of maliciously laying the fault to his own countrymen.</page><page sequence="18">420 Ben Edwin Perry [1937 non-moral type of narrative was especially congenial, as we see from the fact that he introduces a large number of such tales into his work,21 and that much of what he relates about historical persons is conceived in the same purely dramatic spirit, without regard to consistency in character-portrayal, or to the probabilities inherent in the situation itself. He has heard interesting stories about certain famous persons, which sprang into being among the people, and which had already been cast into the varied molds of folklore at different times and places and from different viewpoints; and these he records one after the other, each for the sake of its own peculiar charm, and regardless of the fact that taken together they often yield no consistent or plausible picture either of indi- vidual characters or of historical events.22 Like Solon, Herodotus travelled and gazed upon the world's bazaar OEcop1'qs EIVEKEV-not in order to interpret it, but for the joy of seeing what was there. Passing from one exhibit to another he concentrates his attention upon each with an intellectual curiosity, a sense of wonder, and a singleness of vision that belong rather to the cultural childhood of man than to the somewhat age-weary and academic outlook of the average modern thinker. Things that Herodotus delights to contemplate for their own interest often present themselves to our minds as merely so many data out of which to shape wider or secondary conceptions. In commenting upon He- rodotus' account of the Scythian custom of blinding slaves (in order, apparently, to prevent them from seeing how their 21 Cf. W.

Hertz, 1896), 114: Es gehort nicht viel Stilgefuhl dazu, um zu erkennen, dass die Geschichte von dem Periander, der mit der Leiche seiner Frau Unzucht treibt und die Frauen von Korinth entkleiden lasst, um ihre Gewander zu verbrennen, nicht auf demselben Boden gewachsen ist, auf dem diese ergreifende Erzahlung (P. and his son, Hdt. 3.50-53) entstand.

But he is so absorbed in the way in which the Scythians get their milk, what they do with it and what they think of it, that he forgets to be angry or disgusted about the slaves. Hence a string of details quite irrelevant to the main horror, and which indicate that Herodotus is full of intellectual curiosity but temporarily indifferent to the moral aspects of the story. In that he is a true devotee of OEcopt'a." On the other hand, there are many parts of the History in which attention is focused upon the ethical, religious, or philosophical aspect of things, for these too are interesting to contemplate; but Herodotus differs from Plutarch (and many of us), in that he is not accustomed to look upon everything primarily from one of those standpoints. The point of view in Aeschylus, as in Herodotus and Homer, may be different at different times, according to the occasion and the varying nature of the OEcopta. It is religious and philo- sophical, in the pre-Socratic manner, when the chorus specu- lates upon the ways of God with man; it is poetically moral, in the manner of Homer, when the poet is exhibiting the lofty character of a Prometheus or an Amphiaraus; and it is non- moral, i.e. independent of considerations of good and evil, in those many scenes where, as often in the Agamemnon, irony is the chief source of effect. Now all these elements, and many others besides, that constitute more or less independent sources of poetic or dramatic effect, are co-ordinate in value and are called forth one after the other or simultaneously by the nature of the traditional "plot, from which the poet extracts as much entertainment as possible. For that reason they stand in perfectly harmonious, though mostly paratactic rela- tion one to the other as we read the plays. And while it is true that Aeschylus is especially fond of certain religious ideas, and that he dwells upon these frequently and with great 23 Hdt. 4.2: rovs be bovXovs oL KvOat 7ravras rv4Xo-o rov 7aXaKros eLveKev lro P7rvovo-, 7roLeuz'-res W&amp;E, KTX.</page><page sequence="20">422 Ben Edwin Perry [1937 power and earnestness in the interpretation of certain myths that naturally invite them, it is nevertheless true also that these ideas hold no such monopoly in his mind as do similar ideas in the minds of Plato and his spiritual heirs; if they did, he could never have written such a play as the Prometheus. Unlike some of his interpreters, Aeschylus does not look at all things through glasses colored by one or two favorite con- ceptions. His artistic interests are too many-sided for that, too isonomic, as Plato might say. Pursuant to the primary purpose of entertaining his audience with the varied charms of music, poetry, and spectacle, he can concentrate his atten- tion upon other things than religious edification and upon different aspects of gods and men, especially the dramatic aspects, without seeking at every point to bring his repre- sentation into conformity with the religious or moral ideas that he has proclaimed on previous occasions and in connec- tion with different myths. That is why he can represent the gods now and then in a light that offends Plato and confronts Professor Farnell with an insoluble paradox.24 Plato (Rep. 380a and 383b) will not allow a righteous poet to introduce a character saying that "God invents a pretext whenever he wishes to bring utter ruin on a family" (Aesch. fr. 156), or that Apollo, after virtually promising Thetis a life of happiness in her children, has since treacherously deceived her by be- coming directly responsible for her son's death (Aesch. fr. 350). For Aeschylus, as for Homer, the myth and the dramatic situation determine to a great extent the representation of deity; but for Plato, as for certain modern interpreters of Aeschylus, the fixed idea of what God is, or ought to be, over- rides all other considerations. Among those who seek to define the religion of Aeschylus there is an unfortunate tend- ency to look upon his plays not as dramatic entertainments based upQn primitive myths and poetically elaborated from diverse points of view (as they really were), but as so many articles in a cOmDact theological creed. The Zeus of the 24 See L. R. Farnell, "The Paradox of the Prometheus Vinctus," Jour. Hell. Stud. LIII (1933), 40-50; and below.</page><page sequence="21">Vol. lxviii] Viewing Things Separately 423 Prometheus is very different from the Zeus of the Suppliants or the Oresteia; this fact must remain incomprehensible to all who, like Farnell, assume that 'Zeus' is a fixed value in the mind of Aeschylus, that if he has once been conceived as the High God, then this noble and gratifying conception of Him ought to be preserved as a matter of course on all other occa- sions when He is mentioned, and that in the Prometheus this god is represented as utterly evil and 'vile.' 25 On the other hand, the representation of Zeus in the Prometheus will seem perfectly natural to one who realizes that Aeschylus is pri- marily a dramatist,26 that the traditional myth with which 25 The adjective belongs to W. K. Prentice, Class. Weekly xv 28. The shocking character of Zeus in the Prometheus is greatly exaggerated by those who fancy that the Greek gods were somehow bound to show a tender interest in mankind as a whole (a Christian rather than a Greek, or even a Hebrew idea; cf. supra note 17), that Zeus in the Prometheus has an intense hatred for men (rather he is only indifferent), and that the cruel punishment of Prometheus, who in the eyes of Zeus was a rebel no less than a benefactor, was incompatible with the Greek conception of the High God. Let us remember that our own ancestors, not so long ago, could hymn the High God as All Just and All Merciful and at the same time represent him as one who consigned to ever- lasting fire-about the most fiendish punishment man could imagine-all those who, like Prometheus, transgressed his decrees, or who had not been so favored as to learn rightly about them. That God too was evil, if you must be logical; but neither our ancestors nor the Greeks were logical in just that way. To the Greek audience it was a plausible and not uncomfortable assumption (for the drama's sake) that even the High God, who had not been greatly celebrated for the quality of his mercy anyhow, should inflict cruel punishment upon a rebel, even though that rebel was a benefactor-at least while they were thinking more about Prometheus than about the character of the absent Zeus. While gazing upon the spectacle of Prometheus, they could be as oblivious to the up-to-date propriety of Zeus' conduct (the facts of which conduct were already familiar to them in the old unquestioned myth) as they could be oblivious (likewise for the drama's sake) to the unreality involved in the miraculously speedy arrival of Agamemnon from Troy a few hours after sending the beacon signal. Here, incidentally, Verral would not have found any difficulty had he realized the true nature of Aeschylean and early Greek psychology, which is to a great extent, after all, only what one may appropriately call dramatic psychology. 26 As Professor Fitch well observes (Class. Weekly xxviii 101), Farnell comes close to resolving his own riddle when he remarks tentatively (op. cit. 48, see above note 24): "we might say that he (Aeschylus) gives himself up wholly to his dramatic imagination, which comes near to shattering his normal theologic</page><page sequence="22">424 Ben Edwin Perry [1937 he deals pictured Zeus in a remotely primitive age and at the moment when he had by violent revolution established him- self on a new and as yet insecure throne, that a7ras be rpaXvs oaTTs aP vEO KpaT? (35), and that the character of Zeus, except as adversary, is a far less important consideration for the purposes of this drama than what Prometheus, as the grand protagonist, wills and suffers. If Prometheus suffers, the one who causes it must be cruel. In this play (577 ff, 759, 894 ff) Zeus appears as one who has wronged Jo, as he has wronged Prometheus; but in the Suppliants (524-535) he is hailed as "king of kings, most blessed of the blest, most perfect of rulers . lover of lo." (Save us, pray the chorus, from the rape of the sons of Egyptus!) Here is another paradox for Farnell: to be consistent he would have had to allow that the High God is appropriately addressed only down to E`awrrop 'Ious (535), at which point something un- fortunate and unaccountable besmirches his moral character. For how can one speak of the High God as the violator of a poor innocent young girl? But the truth is of course-and even Farnell would have seen it here, though he failed to recognize the exactly parallel phenomenon of Zeus in the Prometheus-that Jo in the Suppliants is mentioned in a totally different light, not as the victim of Zeus, but as his beloved, and as the ancestress of the Danaid chorus. The ease with which Aeschylus can ignore a favorite theo- logical idea when he happens to be occupied with another contrary one, springs from the same immediacy of interest that makes it possible for him and his audience to overlook also, for dramatic convenience, the most obvious probabilities of time and circumstance. We are told by Dio Chrysostom (Or. 52.5-7) that in the lost Philoctetes of Aeschylus the audience was expected to assume, contrary to the natural probabilities of the case, that Philoctetes could not recognize the well-known Odysseus, and that his evil plight was dis- creed." What a calamity for the searcher after 'higher' monotheistic religion among the polytheistic Greeks! But Fitch adds: "Precisely so. Aeschylus is primarily a dramatist."</page><page sequence="23">Vol. lxviii] Viewing Things Separately 425 covered by the sympathetic chorus of Lemnians only at the beginning of the play, ten years after his abandonment on the island. But Sophocles and Euripides were more conscious of these difficulties; for the former made Lemnos an un- inhabited island, assigned Greek sailors to his chorus, and made Neoptolemos the active agent in the intrigue, while Euripides caused Odysseus to be miraculously disguised by Athena, and made his chorus of Lemnians apologize to Phi- loctetes for their long neglect. Thus Aeschylus, while con- centrating on a dramatic scene, can be oblivious to many things, both logical and theological, that in the modern mind loom up as more conspicuous and more consequential. In the matter of drawing inferences and of associating or not associating one idea or image with another, there are, as it seems to me, three distinct ways of looking at things, the first two of which, in the order below mentioned, are especially characteristic of the Greek mind in the fifth century and earlier: 1. Two or more things (or ideas) that might be logically or otherwise connected with each other are each viewed sepa- rately, and the beholder or narrator is aware of only one at a time-parataxis in various forms. 2. Two things are viewed in juxtaposition or contrast, each of which in some way denies the other, while the onlooker, though intellectually pleased or even deeply moved by the spectacle, nevertheless remains aloof and impartial in his attitude, being affected for.the time being far more by the objective reality of things (OEwpia) than by any sympathy, however natural, for one of the two things in conflict-irony, the antithetic style, the intellectual detach- ment of Thucydides. 3. The spectator, turned partisan, judges one of two things in terms of the other, or with reference to a preconceived system or sentiment, or by pure logic- philosophy instead of nature as the guide to truth. Concerning the first of these three attitudes enough has already been said, except perhaps to remind the reader that, although the manifestations of it are by no means confined to any one stage of cultural progress, or to any particular race of</page><page sequence="24">426 Ben Edwin Perry [1937 men, it is nevertheless most frequently met with in the earliest period of Greek literature, especially in the XELs ELpO/Ev'7, and becomes gradually less common from that time onwards. The third way of looking at things has been mentioned above now and then by way of contrast to the other two. As a constant habit of mind it is essentially modern and post- Socratic, although of course there are many instances of it, within a smaller range of ideas, even in Homer. The inter- preter of early Greek literature must guard against assuming that his author is looking at things in this modern fashion (3) on a great many occasions when, as a matter of fact, the latter's outlook is essentially that indicated above by (1) or (2). When an early author is fitting things together in his mind he usually makes the fact plain, but to take this for granted, as one does in dealing with a modern writer's thought, is hazardous. The second of the three attitudes mentioned above is one which I will not attempt to discuss at length. It resembles the first in point of detachment, or emotional restraint, and in having nothing in common with the third. The kind of irony that predominates in the writings of Aeschylus, Soph- ocles, and Thucydides is serenely and proudly realistic, making no concession to idealism or to wishful thinking of any kind, but rather glorying in the consciousness of being strong enough to refrain from such anodynes. The brave and virtuous hero does not triumph. The noble efforts of Oedipus, Antigone, and Nicias are rewarded with death or utter ruin. And we are cruel enough by nature to enjoy the contemplation of this; not because we are greatly edified by any principle of social or cosmic justice thereby illustrated, but because, apart from our interest in the ironies of the play, we have a triumphant feeling of satisfaction in being able to look straight at such unpleasant realities without flinching and without trying to 'mold them nearer to the heart's desire.' 27 When the spec- 27 "What is it that the soul of the tragic artist communicates to others?

There can be no tragedy when you tell yourself with Plato that no harm can come to a good man; and there can be no real appreciation of Thucydides and his type of mind, if, owing to your cordial disapproval of imperial ruthlessness, you fail to see that in the Melian dialogue, for instance, the folly of the Melians rather than the cruelty of the Athenians is the chief subject of contemplation. Thucydides has the strange faculty of seeing and telling the plain truth of a matter without trying in any way to bring it into line with the cherished beliefs of men.
