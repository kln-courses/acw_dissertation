<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gay Wilson Allen " Waldo Emerson" : Preface to a Biography * WHY Ralph " Waldo Waldo Emerson"? Emerson Ralph Waldo Emerson disliked his first name, and his family and friends called him "Waldo" after he requested them to do so while he was in college- though even as a child he had signed some letters "R. Waldo Emerson." In my forthcoming biography "Ralph" is used in the first two chapters because his family still used it. He was named for his maternal uncle Ralph Haskins, and so far as is known he had no antipathy for this uncle; but he had six cousins named "Ralph"- two on his mother's side and four on his father's. This made it difficult for Ralph Emerson to attain an identity of his own, and even as a child he was an individualist. My subsequent shift to "Waldo" marks important psychological changes in young Emerson. He was beginning to outgrow the daydream- ing adolescence of his unpromising childhood and to acquire the character and personality which would later enable him to play a major role in the making of nineteenth-century American literature. "Waldo" had an emo- tional appeal for him probably because his Waldo ancestors were Wal- densians who fled to England from the Continent to escape persecution for their Protestant religion. The first Emerson to emigrate to America was Thomas, whose grandson married Rebecca Waldo (the daughter of Cornelius, who had moved to Massachusetts during the great migration of the seventeenth century, though he was not a Puritan). Thereafter "Waldo" was continued as a given name in the Emerson family, and the poet kept it alive by naming his first son Waldo. * The biography, Waldo Emerson by Gay Wilson Allen, will be published later this year.

[297]</page><page sequence="2">298 THE GEORGIA REVIEW The name Waldo Emerson should also have more favorable conno- tations for readers of his biography than the forbidding three names, which carry associations with the trinominal New England contempo- raries Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, John Greenleaf Whittier, James Russell Lowell, and Oliver Wendell Holmes, whose genteel writings have not worn as well as Emerson's. For half a century their names have been eclipsed in American literature by Walt Whitman, Herman Mel- ville, and Emily Dickinson, whose voices grow louder and clearer with each passing decade. Until recently that has not been true of Emerson, but he is beginning to assume his rightful place in their company. Aside from his own merits, he is important for his influence on Whitman and Dickinson, and Robert Frost gratefully confessed his indebtedness. Re- cently critics have also begun to see his influence on Wallace Stevens and other modern poets. This suggests vital differences between Emerson and his fading New England contemporaries. The need for a new biography of Emerson is not unrelated to the choice of Waldo Emerson as a title. Ralph L. Rusk's The Life of Ralph Waldo Emerson has served well for three decades as the standard refer- ence for the facts of Emerson's life, but it is weak on the intimate, personal life and in literary interpretation, which Rusk deliberately kept to a mini- mum. He did a prodigious amount of research, and most of the documents were available to him, though not quite all. Furthermore, the intellectual climate has changed so much in the past three decades that it is possible to see Emerson today in ways not possible when Rusk wrote his biog- raphy. Biographers now also pay more attention to social and intellectual background than Rusk did. His Life was, therefore, somewhat deficient both on the subjective and the objective side. Subjectively, Emerson developed from an unhappy "ugly duckling" childhood- when his parents and teachers thought he was not as bright as his one older and two younger brothers- to a troubled adolescence and a moody, introspective young manhood. He grew up preferring solitary meditation to social activity. As a young Unitarian minister he was only partly successful because he disliked visiting and officiating at funerals and weddings, preferring to read, contemplate, and write in his own library. To his congregation, theological questions had already been an- swered by the men who wrote the creeds and founded the traditions of their church. All they expected from their pastor was a repetition of these accepted "truths" in soothing and encouraging sermons. But to Emerson nothing was settled; every inherited belief and custom needed to be</page><page sequence="3">GAY WILSON ALLEN 299 examined in the light of modern experience and the individual conscience. To him the essential thing in the religious life was not conformity but a live relationship with God- the feeling that "God is, not was." Inevitably this conviction led to conflict with church officials, the custodians of tra- dition, and to Emerson's resignation from his pastorate. Emerson's biography is a story of continuous struggle- physical and intellectual (until middle age)- and refinement of his ideas in successive lectures, essays, and poems. Even the key words of his vocabulary changed subtly in meaning from year to year, or book to book, so that his mean- ing must always be derived from the context. Emerson's first book, Nature (1836), is often regarded as difficult, but it is much easier to un- derstand if the reader is familiar with the preceding lectures on natural science and passages on the Neoplatonists in the journals of the period. It was no accident that Emerson chose natural science for his first public lectures. Contemporary geology, astronomy, and physiology were liber- ating him from the theological dogma he had been taught, and Neopla- tonism suggested to him a theology for his own age. In Emerson's fertile mind, the most (seemingly) unlikely sources fused in his own creations, like Neoplatonism combined with the latest theories and discoveries in the sciences. The eighteenth-century Scottish "Common Sense" philosophy might seem incompatible with Plotinus and Plato, but Emerson's concept of the "moral sentiment" came from Adam Smith ( Theory of Moral Sentiments , 1759), Richard Price, Thomas Reid, and Dugald Stewart- the very men whom Thomas Jefferson studied at William and Mary. Emerson's theory of the "moral sentiment," there- fore, though derived from Scottish philosophers, is as American as the Declaration of Independence. But the Scottish school prepared the way for Utilitarianism, which Emerson emphatically rejected, preferring the path of the Neoplatonists to "natural" truths. Emerson's lecture on "Poetry and Imagination" illustrates the eclec- ticism of his literary sources, combining subjective philosophy (Idealism) and the latest theories of his day on "natural philosophy" (physics) . Since his first trip to Europe he had followed closely the discoveries of chemists and physicists about the nature of nature. They had taught him that "noth- ing stands still in Nature but death; that the creation is on wheels, in transit, always passing into something else . . . that matter is not what it ap- pears. . . ." In London in 1848 he had heard Michael Faraday lecture. He said that "when we should arrive at the monads, or primordial elements (the supposed little cubes or prisms of which all matter was built up), we</page><page sequence="4">ЗОО THE GEORGIA REVIEW should not find cubes or prisms or atoms, at all, but spherules of force." In the twentieth century atomic physicists would find on the sub- atomic level not "building blocks" but "fields" of energy attracting and repulsing each other, and the interchange of energy and matter. Further- more, that the phenomena observed could not be separated from the ob- server. Arthur Eddington would even go so far as to say that the physical world is entirely abstract and without " 'actuality' apart from its linkage to consciousness." This resembles the "noble doubt" Emerson first ex- pressed in Nature (1836). In "Poetry and Imagination" he says: "Every correspondence we observe in mind and matter suggests a substance older and deeper than either of these old nobilities." Emerson was sympathetic, therefore, with the Hindus, "who, following Buddha, have made it the central doctrine of their religion that what we call Nature, the external world, ... is only phenomenal." In these speculations Emerson became a link between Neoplatonism, Eastern mystics, and such pioneers in atomic physics of the twentieth century as Werner Heisenberg, Robert Oppen- heimer, and Niels Bohr. In Physics and Human Knowledge Bohr says: "For a parallel to the lesson of atomic theory . . . [we must] turn to those kinds of epistemological problems with which already thinkers like the Buddha and Lao Tzu have been confronted when trying to harmonize our position as spectators and actors in the great drama of existence." It turns out, therefore, that Emerson's so-called mysticism may not be so antiquated as some modern critics have thought. Of course the term "mystic" is ambiguous and has been defined in many ways. In the sense that a finite mind can communicate with the Infinite Mind, Emerson was a mystic, for he believed that such communication was possible through prayer, meditation, and intuition. He had two or three experiences which might be called epiphanies : one in Charleston, South Carolina, in his early manhood, when he experienced "a dazzling infinity" opening before him, and the famous "transparent eye-ball" sensation described in Nature , and previously in his Journals. Emerson also believed profoundly that in all great art These temples grew as grows the grass; Art might obey, but not surpass, The passive Master lent his hand To the vast soul that o'er him planned. . . . This was, and remained, Emerson's idea of artistic "inspiration," but it says little more than any devout Christian believed about God's relation</page><page sequence="5">GAY WILSON ALLEN 3OI to the world He created- though not usually thought of as a theory in aesthetics. Emerson later rejected an anthropomorphic God and called his deity Mind, Reason, or Over-Soul; but the traditional Christian belief in the subordination of matter to soul or spirit always remained the central assumption in his philosophy. These basic assumptions were reinforced (though not initiated) by Emerson's reading of the Neoplatonists, especially Plotinus (the "certain poet" in Nature, who says to him that, "The foundations of man are not in matter but in spirit"; and later in the "Hindu Scriptures" (Emerson's term), from which he borrowed several Sanskrit terms, such as Brahma and Over-Soul (a translation of At-Man, the supreme and universal soul) . These gave Emerson new terminology and metaphors, but not funda- mentally new thoughts. Their influence on his art was extensive, but not the beginning of his "mysticism." In a chronological study of Emerson's writings these influences are seen in their proper perspective. Each stage of his intellectual development prepared for the next. Emerson is a dif- ficult author for the reader who begins in medias res (as he is usually taught in college) , instead of following the order of his unfolding experiences, the organic growth of his mind. Believing profoundly that the Christian conscience is an oracle, Emer- son sought by introspection to find answers to moral problems. Through close observation of his own mind, he came to feel that a greater mind was in some mysterious way thinking through him, or prompting his finite mind. This introspection led him to anticipate William James's de- scription of the "stream of consciousness." Like James, too, he strongly suspected that the hidden source of consciousness was an unconscious mind in which his thoughts originated. In these observations and deductions Emerson also anticipated later psychologists of the unconscious (Freud) or the collective unconscious (Jung) . Eric Fromm in The Forgotten Language says, "One of the most beautiful and concise statements on the superior rational character of our mental process in sleep is made by Emerson." Fromm refers to the lecture on "Demonology," in which Emerson says, "Dreams have a poetic in- tegrity and truth. . . . Wise and sometimes terrible hints shall in them be thrown to the man out of quite unknown intelligence." Although in his Journals Emerson many times described and specu- lated on his dreams, he was more interested in the relation of his uncon- scious to his waking mind, by which he experienced impulses and in- tuitions that he could not account for rationally. He came to feel that it</page><page sequence="6">302 THE GEORGIA REVIEW was by this "doorway" that God entered his consciousness. This is quite different, of course, from Freud's theory of the Id and the unconscious, perhaps nearer to Jung's Collective Unconscious. But the important point is that Emerson was pioneering in psychology. And his confidence in the healthy effect of the harmony between his conscious and unconscious mind was an early example of psychiatric therapy. Many episodes in his biography show that this belief was good therapy for him, as in his re- covery from what was probably tuberculosis in early manhood; from his nervous breakdown after his first wife's death and his resignation from the Second Church in Boston; and from the shock he experienced in the deaths of his brothers Edward and Charles and his son Waldo. A common criticism of Emerson is that he denied the existence of evil. It is true that he did not view life as tragic, unlike William Faulkner, Robert Penn Warren, and other Southern authors (the Southern literary mind gravitates naturally to tragedy) . But Emerson's philosophy of pain and evil has often been misunderstood. He did not say that they do not exist, but that they are not "real," meaning that they are finite and remedi- able. Tragedy is irremediable: predestined, inescapable, a permanent con- dition under which a fated person must live and die. Emerson was well aware of social injustice, political dishonesty, and human errors of judg- ment. But he thought that rational judgment and moral action in response to the "inner voice" of conscience could at least ameliorate if not entirely eliminate these human evils, and often cure them. Physical pain from accident or illness could also, Emerson believed, be blunted and endured by a courageous exercise of the will. This belief derived in part from his firm confidence in a benevolent deity, and in part from his reading Plutarch and other authors who praised stoicism. Both sources helped him endure his own residence in the "house of pain." When his son died, he lamented that he did not feel it deeply, but actually the shock had numbed his nervous system. He felt so deeply that he could not feel. In fact, he never ceased to grieve for that "beautiful boy"- the last words he was heard to utter on his deathbed. A major concern to Emerson in his life and in his writings was man's relation to nature or the physical world. As indicated above, he theorized about the spiritual nature of matter, but he was also very much concerned with practical relations with nature. He was an ecologist before the word was used, though not quite to the extent that Thoreau was. The accu- sation in "The Sphinx" that man "poisons the ground" was undoubtedly intended in a practical as well as a philosophical sense. Of course he was</page><page sequence="7">GAY WILSON ALLEN 303 not so prophetic as to foresee the destructive use of pesticides. He was ap- palled, however, in 1 848 by the industrial pollution in England, and later in this country in Pittsburgh. Throughout his writings Emerson insisted that men and women must obey the laws of nature to avoid disaster, personally and collectively. Though optimistic in the long run about the future of the human race, he was pessimistic about contemporary men, and was severely critical of their greed, ignorance, and dishonesty. He refused to join the social reform movements because he believed individual action better than collective. Unless the individual could be improved, there was no hope for society. His own reform began with himself. During his early years as artist and thinker, Emerson tried to remain aloof from political and social reform so that he might give full attention to his own mental and moral development, but his conscience inevitably drew him into the struggle for the abolition of slavery and the defense of a free society- more deeply than he usually gets credit for. In 1838 the removal of the Cherokee Indians from their ancestral lands by the United States Government provoked him to write an indignant letter to Presi- dent Van Buren. He found it hard to believe, he said, that the American Government would lie and steal and act brutishly. He learned that it could and did. As early as 1 844, in observing the anniversary of the emancipation of Negro slaves in the West Indies, Emerson delivered in Concord a master- ful address on the evils of slavery. His plan to buy the slaves from their plantation owners could have saved a Civil War, which cost many mil- lions more in lives and property. A few years later the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law, requiring every citizen to assist in the capture and return of runaway slaves, destroyed all his respect for his former friend Daniel Webster. He became so disillusioned about government, constitu- tions, and elected officials that for a time he was an anarchist. This is also a side of Emerson which has received too little attention in biography and criticism. Readers of Emerson's angry words in the decade of the 1 8 5 o's will be reminded of similar denunciations in the 1960's. Emerson denounced the war with Mexico as immoral, and slavery as a violation of every civi- lized principle of human rights. But this tumultuous period in Emerson's life was also progressive. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation restored his faith in the Government. When his anger cooled, however, so did his creativity. Yet one can hardly begrudge Emerson a more relaxed life after</page><page sequence="8">3O4 THE GEORGIA REVIEW his great efforts. The graceful way in which he accepted the handicaps of old age give his last years the tone of Shakespeare's final phase in his "romances." In Emerson's biography is mirrored the life of the American nation during his lifetime. Few men of the nineteenth century had more exten- sive knowledge of the period- beginning with the history of Concord, where the American Revolution began in sight of his grandfather in the Old Manse; extending through the years of territorial expansion, the Mexican War and the Civil War, the settling of the West, which he ob- served on almost annual lecture journeys to the new states and territories; and ending with a trip by train to California in old age. Emerson also made three trips to Europe, the last extending to Egypt. In his travels he met and won the friendship of most of the leaders of his day in literature, government, science, invention, and finance, whom he shrewdly evalu- ated in his Journals, letters, and lectures. He called traveling "a fool's paradise," but he found it no paradise, and he was no fool. In recent years several scholars and critics have rediscovered Emer- son's importance as a poet, most notably Hyatt Waggoner, Harold Bloom, Roy Harvey Pearce, and Joel Porte. All have provided new ways of looking at Emerson's poems, but the discoveries of two other scholars have been largely overlooked. In 1907 George E. Woodberry observed that in his poems Emerson "conceives the energy of Nature as a Dionysian force ... a dance of the atoms." And in 1943 the scholar of Persian literature, Professor John D. Johannen, published studies of Emer- son's translations from a German translation of Persian poetry. These translations and his essay on "Persian Poetry" reveal that what Emerson most admired in the Persian poets was their intoxication of the senses. Rereading Emerson's poems and his comments on the "Gai science" can lead to new appreciation and understanding of his poetry and theory. Im- probable as it may sound, Persian aesthetic inebriation and the Bacchanalia of Nature combined to give Emerson both subject matter and mode: rhythm, imagery, and tone. Woodberry was concerned only with the influence of science in the statement quoted, but he also observed that Emerson's poems "are autobiographical in a very strict sense." Most critics have looked in his essays for autobiography. Joel Porte, in a very perceptive biographical-critical study, calls Emerson the "Representative Man." That is a good title, because his life did represent, both in example and precept, the best in human nature. But another term Emerson used was the "Central Man," a phrase that appealed</page><page sequence="9">GAY WILSON ALLEN 305 to Wallace Stevens, as Harold Bloom has observed. The "Central Man" is a Platonic concept: it takes the best attributes of a great many men to form an ideal man- a complete man. If these qualities could be embodied in one man, he would be what Nietsche, with confessed indebtedness to Emerson, called the XJbermensch, popularly translated as "Superman," though literally "Over-Man." Countless readers of Emerson's essays and poems have been stimu- lated to set higher goals for themselves and to believe in their own ability to achieve them. This teaching has often been debased by interpreting the goals to be material- making Emerson's "self-reliance" and "better mouse-trap" bywords for Rotarians- but his own life shows that that was not his meaning. It was, to use the term of Plato and Aristotle, "the good life." What is the good life? Emerson's biography gives the answer, partly in his own experiences and more fully in his writings. The "good life," like the "Central Man," is never fully attainable, but Emerson came closer to it than most men, or authors. For that reason John Dewey said that "when democracy has articulated itself, it will have no difficulty in finding itself already proposed in Emerson."</page></plain_text>
