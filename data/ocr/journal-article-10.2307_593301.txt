Uppsala: APPEL- BERGS BOKTRYCKERi AKTIEBOLAG, 1922. xi+313 S. Despite the evidence of human experience, we are so accus- tomed to divide gods, men, and things into two mutually ex- clusive categories, the good and the bad, that it is not easy for us to conceive of a deity like Rudra, who is at the same time a destructive beast and a benevolent physician. For the mere historical evolution, through a euphemism, of the terrible Rudra of Rig-Veda into the epic Siva of the Hindu trinity does not explain a contradiction that exists in the earliest Veda and seems to be quite natural to Vedic anthropomorphism. The apparent inconsistency in Rudra's character is a part of the paleness of individuality, the diffuseness of attributes and functions, and the unmorality, according to our standards, that mark the entire Vedic pantheon. And it is this, together with a scholarly pre- disposition to seek in every god a definite force of nature, that has made so difficult a real understanding of Rudra's origin, personality, and history.</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 57 Arbman attempts to solve the problem by an analytic and synthetic study of all the material, both Vedic and post-Vedic. While he may not have caught the god in the moment of his creation, and while his evidence may not amount to proof, he has at least evolved a theory that seems reasonable in itself, minimizes several difficulties, and appears to survive every test of application; and that is about the best that can be expected in such matters. The book is a real contribution to methodology. The material is handled with delicacy and sureness of touch, interpreted with keenness of perception, and presented with fairness and logic. The author's interest is directed primarily toward the popu- lar element in the ancient Indian religion, an element to which recent scholarship is giving increased attention in its search for the origins of India's complicated religious life. Out- side of the mechanized and ritualized religion of the Vedic priests, in the popular cult of demons, which by its very nature was largely excluded from the hieratic texts, he finds, with unvedic distinction of personality, the real god Rudra. His theory, in outline, is as follows. In his original character Rudra is a gruesome, terrestrial de- mon, a product of primitive conceptions of death and its hor- rors. From this ancient demonic figure there runs, entirely with- in the popular religion, an unbroken line of development to the popular god Siva. The Rudra of the later Vedic tradition is not a direct descendant of the Rig-Vedic Rudra, but represents a far more original type out of which the Rig-Vedic Rudra was, relatively late, developed, in order then, still later, to give way to his popular double. The cause of the development is to be sought in the religious sterility of the Vedic sacrificial priests. In essential characteristics the popular Siva type rep- resents the original Rudra. Although Rudra was a god of death, he was no Yama to show departing souls the way to immortality or to rule over them in the abode of the dead. He has no connection with the Pitaras. Rudra has many features in common with certain death-gods of other Indo-European peoples, with the Germanic Odin and the Greek Hecate. These agreements are certainly to be ex- plained by close relationship, but Arbman postpones, without prejudice, a verdict on von Schroeder's claim that Rudra and</page><page sequence="3">58 Reviews of Books Odin represent a common inheritance from one and the same Indo-European type of god; at least Rudra-Siva seems to be- long to a more primitive, ruder type, perhaps to the corpse- eating demons of death. Arbman sees in the Rudra of the Rig-Veda a priest-exalted but essentially demonic god who hurls his murderous missiles from heaven upon earthly creatures, but who has a positive side as a helper and benefactor of men when his favor is properly invoked. He has considerable individuality, but he is so lack- ing in concrete features that it is impossible to explain his orig- inal character with the Rig-Veda as the only, or even chief, source, as many scholars have attempted to do. But even in the Rig-Veda Rudra does not reveal himself in the thunder- storm; his bolt is merely the imagery of sickness and death- unless the same weapon is to make Varuna, Agni, Dyaus, and other gods and even demons into personifications of the thunder- storm. And the Rig-Veda itself shows that the connection of Rudra with the Maruts was one of association rather than relationship. In the later Vedic literature Rudra appears as the same malevolent and benevolent individual whom we have just seen in the Rig-Veda, only here he is not a god of heaven, but an earthly being of a lower, more popular type, excluded from the soma sacrifice, friend and patron of thieves, seen sneaking in lonely places by herdsmen and maids, a demon of the mountains, the crossroads, and the wilderness, himself lord of the demon world. The evil which he inflicts consists of various maladies and epidemics.' To him one sacrifices when disease breaks out among men or cattle.2 To Arbman, this late Vedic Rudra is, as we have seen, the real Rudra, descended through the popu- lar religion from the original demon out of which the Brahmans independently developed the Rig-Vedic deity. Siva likewise lives wild in the forest, wears an animal skin, in general stands close to primitive nature, and identifies himself with the popular Rudra of late Vedic tradition. I See Arbman's references on pp. 23ff. 2 Here is the chiasm of the two sides of Rudra. The god who causes the disease is asked to cure or prevent it: a sort of sirmilia similibus cu- rantur. This is not sufficiently stressed by Arbman.</page><page sequence="4">Reviews of Books 59 This leads into a long discussion of Rudra's position in the Vedic ritual, and the relations between the Brahmanical religion and the popular cult, a discussion into which we cannot go here, but which is important for Arbman's argument. He discusses, among other ceremonies, the traiyambakahoma; the bali as an uncooked, merely exposed, popular sacrifice; the word deva as including both gods and demons; the Maruts and the Rudras; Rudra as bhitapati 'lord of demons'; the satarudriya as a rite applying to the world of demons and its ruler Rudra; the epithets of Rudra in the s'atarudriya; (adversely) the identification of Siva as a fusion of Agni with Rudra. An entire chapter is devoted to Rudra's essential character as a god of death. There will be much resistance among scholars to Arbman's theory. The great majority of Western Vedists are on record as favoring the conception of Rudra as a god of the storm, especially the thunder-storm: Weber, Kuhn, Whitney, Lassen, Ludwig, Barth, Kaegi, Monier-Williams, Hardy, Deussen, Bloom- field, Hopkins, Macdonell. Hillebrandt views Rudra as a god of the climatic terrors of the tropical hot season that follows the rains, Bergaigne sees in him a form of le pere celeste, and several have followed von Schroeder in considering Rudra the Indo-Eu- ropean leader of the souls of the dead, riding in the wind and storm. Arbman is closest to Oldenberg, who has recognized Rudra as an unheavenly product of the lower mythology, a death and disease bringing power of the mountains and forests, akin to the European fauns and satyrs. Winternitz and, in less degree, Pischel have agreed with him. To the reviewer, the situation is about as follows. (1) The interpretation of Rudra as a god of the thunder-storm is decidedly unsatisfactory. Almost the only evidence for that theory is the bolt with which the Rig-Veda arms him, and his association with the Maruts. But the thunderbolt is almost as common a weapon in the Vedic pantheon as the club in savage society; and the association with the Maruts is not one of character. Moreover, and this seems not to be mentioned by Arbman, thunder-storms in northern India are not of sufficient frequency and severity to explain the Rig-Vedic picture of the god and his terrors: a pupil of the writer has lived eight years near Allahabad and has never seen even a tree struck by lightning. Rig-Veda makes Rudra a devastating slayer of men and cattle;</page><page sequence="5">60 Reviews of Books the inference is that whole communities are laid low by his wrath. (2) There is, as Arbman claims, a decided break in the continuity of Rudra between the Rig-Veda and the later Vedic texts, a break which seems best explained by assuming a resurgence of an ancient popular tradition, which itself best explains the still later Siva. (3) Rudra appears even in the Rig-Veda as a god of sickness, pestilence, and death. This is probably his original character. (4) If this was his real character, then the demonic prototype of the late Vedic Rudra is more original than the celestial Rudra of the Rig-Veda, and the latter was largely a hieratic adaptation which did not have sufficient vitality to persist unchanged even within the Brahman tradition. (5) One hesitates at Arbman's early and definite localization of the god on the Munijavant and in the Himalayas: the re- viewer still retains a certain sympathy for Hopkins' tirade against Oldenberg's "Old Man of the Mountains." Of the larger questions involved only this need be said here: The antiquity of the Rig-Veda gives a presumption but not proof of priority. There is no doubt that in Rig-Vedic times there was a deep current of popular religion, flowing from very ancient sources, and for the most part avoiding hieratic channels. Every attempt to reconstruct this primitive folk-religion and every attempt to determine priority must be judged on its merits. It may add to our understanding of the earliest Vedas; in Arbman's case it apparently does. Princeton University HAROLD H. BENDER</page></plain_text>
