I argue that this assumption is mistaken. As emerges in his discussion of "materially false ideas" in the Fourth Replies, Descartes recognizes two senses of 'idea of. One, a theoretical sense, is itself introduced in terms of objective being. Hence Descartes can't be introducing objective being to explain or describe "ofness" understood in this sense. Descartes also appeals to a pretheoretical sense of 'idea of. I will argue that the notion of objective being can't serve to explain or describe this "ofness" either. I conclude by proposing an alternative explanation of the role of objective being, according to which Descartes introduces this notion to explain the mind's ability to attain clear and distinct ideas. One way Descartes speaks of the intentionality of ideas is in terms of "objective being," a notion he appropriates from a strand of the Scho lastic tradition.1 In the Third Meditation, for example, he refers to "the mode of being by which a thing is objectively in the intellect through an idea [essendi modus, quo res est objective in intellectu per ideam]" (AT 7:412). There has been much debate about the ontology of For historical overviews, see especially Nuchelmans (1983, ch. 1-2), Ayers (1998), Clemenson (2007), and (although Descartes isn't discussed) King (2007) and Twee dale (2007). For the most part, translations from Descartes will be based on those in Cotting ham, Stoothoff, Murdoch and Kenny (1984-91; henceforth CSMK). Where I have made significant modifications, Descartes's original is provided in brackets at the first occurrence. Translations from Suarez, as well as from the non-English second ary literature, are my own. Since the CSMK volumes include page numbers from Adam and Tannery (1964-76; henceforth AT), I cite only the latter. For reference, here is a list of cited texts by AT volume: AT 1-5 (correspondence, CSMK 3), AT 6 (Discourse on the Method, CSMK 1), AT 7 (Meditations and Objections/Replies, CSMK 2), AT 8A (Principles of Philosophy, CSMK 1), AT 8B (Comments on a Cer tain Broadsheet, CSMK 1), AT 9A (appendix to the Fifth Replies, CSMK 2), AT 10 (The Search for Truth, CSMK 2), AT 11 (The Passions of the Soul, CSMK 1). LIONEL SHAPIRO</page><page sequence="2">objective being in Descartes. At issue are the kinds of identity and dis tinction that obtain between three entities: the modification of the intel lect, the thing that has objective being in the intellect, and the real thing.3 By contrast, fewer questions have been raised about the purpose for which Descartes introduces objective being. Like his Scholastic pre decessors, it is thought, he does so in order to explain, or at least to describe, a mental entity's status as being "of something."4 He then uses this explanation or description in the reasoning by which he infers that God exists from the fact that he has an "idea of God." In this paper, I will argue that the usual approach is mistaken. My argument is based on Descartes's much-discussed reply to a criticism in Arnauld's Fourth Objections. Just as today's readers do, Arnauld attri butes to him the following linkage between objective being and "ofness": (1) An idea of x is an idea through which x has objective being in the intellect. Arnauld then argues that this linkage leaves no room for the possibility of a false idea of anything (AT 7:206-7). He therefore expresses puzzle ment at Descartes's claim, in the Third Meditation, that a certain kind of idea "will not undeservedly be called false [non immerito falsa dice tur■]" (AT 7:43-4).5 Descartes's reply to Arnauld's objection is notoriously confusing.6 Still, most commentators take him to be conceding (1) while denying that it implies there can be no false idea of anything. I will argue that this reading doesn't fit the text. In fact, Descartes replies that Arnauld's objection rests on a fallacy of equivocation. Descartes distinguishes two senses in which we can take the expression 'idea of. Taken in one sense, a theoretical sense, to be an "idea of' an object just is to be an idea through which that object has objective being. When 'idea of is taken in The literature on this topic is helpfully taxonomized in Clemenson (2007, 58-9); an omission is Nuchelmans (1983). See also Pessin (2007). Brower and Brower-Toland (2008) present the same two options as rival accounts of the purpose for which Aquinas appeals to "intentional being." The claim that falsity occurs only in judgments was a late Scholastic commonplace (Wells 1984, 29-30). It is defended in Suarez's Metaphysical Disputations (1597, Dis putation 9, Section 1, paragraphs 14-16, vol. 2:181-2 of the 1960-6 edition) and in the commentary on Aristotle's De Interpretatione by the Jesuits of Coimbra (Coim bra 1607, Book 1, Chapter 1, Question 5, Article 4; reprinted with translation in Doyle 2001, 162-75). Wilson (1990, 69) calls it "both fairly detailed and extremely bewildering," Hoffman (1996, 369) reports that it is "considered to be one of the most obscure and unsatis factory passages in the entire Cartesian corpus," and Ayers (1998, 1100n39) calls it "obscure in its details and structure." OBJECTIVE BEING AND "OFNESS" IN DESCARTES 379</page><page sequence="3">this sense, (1) is true by definition. But when Descartes affirms that there can be a false idea of something, he intends that 'idea of be taken in an ordinary, pretheoretical sense. Understood this way, he insists, (1) often fails. Much of the paper will be devoted to explaining the counterexample to (1) he defends in the Fourth Replies, so let me here use a simpler coun terexample inspired by a remark in a letter. A pagan may have an idea that is, in the pretheoretical sense, of Jupiter. Yet, according to Descartes, it may be the true God, rather than Jupiter, who has objective being in the pagan's intellect through this idea.7 If this is right, the usual account of why Descartes appeals to objec tive being fails. He can't be introducing objective being to explain or describe what an idea is "of' in his theoretical sense, since such "ofness" is itself introduced in terms of objective being. But he can't be introducing objective being to explain or describe what an idea is "of' in the pretheoretical sense either, since what an idea is "of' in this sense may diverge from what has objective being through the idea. I will propose that Descartes invokes objective being for an altogether different purpose—as part of his rationalist explanation of the mind's ability to attain clear and distinct ideas. By explaining his careful rea soning in a passage often thought to be confused, I thus aim to illumi nate a highly distinctive dimension of his thought. In itself, the strategy of interpreting Descartes's reply in terms of two kinds of object-directedness is not new. Margaret Wilson, most notably, has tried to "make sense of Descartes's reply" to Arnauld by attributing a "distinction between senses of ... 'idea of."8 If I am right, though, neither of his senses has been correctly identified. In particular, contrary to Wilson's suggestion, neither sense gestures toward anything like a present-day "causal account" of representation.9 My argument comes in four parts. In Section 1,1 show how Descartes defends the possibility of false ideas by distinguishing two senses of 'idea of. In Section 2, I identify one of these senses—the one that doesn't cor respond to objective being—as the pretheoretical sense. This raises the problem of accounting for the other, theoretical, sense and hence for objective being. In Section 3, I start by elaborating Descartes's account of a class of false ideas. Moving beyond the hypothetical example at issue in his exchange with Arnauld, I suggest several examples of ideas he may think actually belong to this class. Based on my analysis of these The passage I am drawing on (AT 4:188) will be discussed in Section 3.2. I mean to leave open whether or not Descartes posits an entity "God insofar as he has objec tive being in the intellect" that is really distinct from God. 8 Wilson (1990, 69-70). See note 24 for other such readings. 9 Wilson (1990, 75-6). LIONEL SHAPIRO</page><page sequence="4">examples, Section 4 then proposes an interpretation of objective being and the corresponding theoretical sense of'idea of. 1. Descartes's Distinguo 1.1. Arnauld's Objection Descartes introduces objective being in the Third Meditation. To prove the existence of God, he appeals to a principle that relates the "objec tive reality" an idea contains to the "formal reality" of that idea's actu ally existing cause. Here the objective reality an idea contains appears to be the degree of "perfection" possessed by whatever has objective being in the intellect through that idea (AT 7:40-1; cf. 7:161).10 Subse quently, in the First Replies, he accepts his objector's formula accord ing to which "an idea is the thing itself which is thought, insofar as it is objectively in the intellect [ipsam rem cogitatam, quatenus est objective in intellectu]" (AT 7:102, from 7:92). For example, "the idea of the sun is the sun itself existing in the intellect—not of course formally existing, as it does in the heavens, but objectively...." At least in the First Replies, then, Descartes endorses a formulation of principle (1): (la) The idea of x is x itself insofar as it has objective being in the intellect." Arnauld, who had seen the First Replies when he wrote his Fourth Objections (AT 7:200), regards (la) as common ground. The "idea of cold," he says, "is cold itself insofar as it is objectively in the intellect" (AT 7:206). A little later, Arnauld mentions "the objective being which [an idea] contains and which it exhibits [exhibet] to our mind" (AT 7:207). In effect, he is saying that an object's having objective being through an idea amounts to the idea's exhibiting that object to the mind. Hence, in view of (la), he takes Descartes to affirm that an idea of an object is one that exhibits that object to the mind. Throughout the texts under 10 See Ayers (1998, 1067) and Clemenson (2007, 20-1). 11 I will often write 'has objective being' where Descartes himself would write 'is objectively', rendered in CSMK. as 'exists objectively'. In the First Replies, Descartes does twice abbreviate his usual talk of a thing "insofar as it is objectively in the intellect" by speaking of it "existing in the intellect [in intellectu existens]" (AT 7:102-3). Typically, however, he reserves 'existence' for "actual or formal being" or "potential being," the two modes of being expressly distinguished from "objective being" in the Third Meditation (AT 7:47). For the Scholastic back ground, see Clemenson (2007, 14-21). OBJECTIVE BEING AND "OFNESS" IN DESCARTES 38 1</page><page sequence="5">discussion, both philosophers appear to speak interchangeably of an idea's "exhibiting" and "representing" an object to the mind.12 Arnauld thus takes as further common ground an alternative formula tion of (1): (lb) An idea is the idea of x if and only if it represents/exhibits x to the mind.13 In his reply, Descartes doesn't dispute Arnauld's link between objective existence and representing/exhibiting. Indeed, the substance of his reply doesn't depend on which of the following entities a Cartesian idea is taken to be: (i) some object insofar as it has objective being in one's intellect (ii) the operation of the intellect that represents/exhibits that object to one. To simplify my presentation, I will assume the correctness of a wide spread reading according to which Descartes's distinction between (i) and (ii) is a mere "distinction of reason." The operation of the intellect that represents an object is not "really distinct" from that object qua objectively in the intellect.14 Indeed, I will assume the (possibly stron ger) view that entities (i) and (ii) are numerically identical.15 While I find the identity interpretation persuasive, my conclusions and argu ments could be reformulated so as not to presuppose it.16 Arnauld's objection is that (la) and (lb) are contradicted by the Third Meditation's passage on false ideas. Here the meditator remarks that in addition to the strict falsity that pertains only to judgments, 12 See Wells (1984, 29n21) and Wilson (1990, 80n4). 13 For an explicit endorsement of this reading of Descartes, see Nadler (1989, 161-2). 14 This interpretation, which traces to Arnauld (1683, 47-9), is defended by Nuchel mans (1983, 40-1), Nadler (1989, 129, 159), Hoffman (2002b, 179n44), Kemmerling (2004, 63), Clemenson (2007, ch. 3) and Brown (2008, 200-2, 213). See also Ayers (1998, 1067-8) and Camp (2002, ch. 18). Against the interpretation, see Wells (1994, 147-55). Descartes presents his theory of distinctions in Principles I, articles 60-2 (AT 8A:28-30; CSMK translates 'distinctio rationis' as 'conceptual distinc tion'). 15 Hoffman (2002a) disputes the common reading on which the obtaining of a mere "distinction of reason" implies numerical identity. 16 I agree with Secada (2000, 97) that Arnauld's criticism doesn't depend on the iden tity interpretation. LIONEL SHAPIRO</page><page sequence="6">"there is a certain other kind of falsity in ideas, a material falsity [quaedam alia falsitas materialis in ideis], when they represent non things as things.'"7 For all the meditator knows at this point, his ideas of "colours, sounds, smells, tastes, heat and cold, and the other tactile qualities" might suffer from this kind of falsity: For example, the ideas which I have of heat and cold contain so little clarity and distinctness that they do not enable me to tell whether cold is merely the privation \privatio] of heat or vice versa, or whether both of them are real qualities, or neither is. And ... if it is true that cold is nothing but the privation of heat, the idea which represents it to me as something real and positive will not undeservedly be called false.... (AT 7:43-4) Privations serve here as examples of beings that are not real things (res), in a traditional sense in which a real thing is anything capable of actual existence.18 In the Third Meditation, then, I am asked to consider the possibility that cold is a privation, although my idea of cold "represents it to me as something real and positive." As Arnauld reads the passage, we will soon see, the hypothetical scenario the meditator is contemplating can be specified as follows: (2) My idea of cold might turn out to represent something other than cold to me, and thus fail to be cold itself insofar as it has objective being in my intellect. Arnauld's complaint is that (2) is "inconsistent with the author's own principles," namely (la) and (lb). His diagnosis is that Descartes has confused an idea's object with the object it is judged to have (AT 7:206-7). While my idea of cold can represent nothing other than cold 17 He needn't mean that this is the only circumstance in which an idea is "materially false." Hence we needn't assume (with M. Beyssade 1994, 233-6) that Descartes revises his usage in the Fourth Replies, where he says he simply "means that the ideas are such as to provide matter [materiam] for error" (AT 7:231). A number of scholars deny that "representing non-things as things" is intended as a necessary condition for material falsity: Nelson (1996, 20), Hoffman (1996, 358, cf. 377), Kaufman (2000, 396-8, 406n55) and Clemenson (2007, 89). By contrast, Field (1993, 314-6) construes it as a necessary condition. According to Menn (1995, 199n26), representing non-things as things is Descartes's "real definition" of material falsity, while providing matter for error is his "nominal definition." I will return to this issue in Section 4. 18 Wilson (1978, 107-8) and M. Beyssade (1994, 237-9); cf. Secada (2000, 92-3) and Clemenson (2007, 14-17). It isn't clear that Descartes is here distinguishing between "privations" and mere "negations" (see Secada 2000, 285n36 and Wee 2006, 116). OBJECTIVE BEING AND "OFNESS" IN DESCARTES</page><page sequence="7">to me, I may mistakenly judge that a particular idea (one that repre sents something other than cold to me) is an idea of cold.19 The key question dividing interpreters of Descartes's reply is whether he affirms the meditator's entitlement to (2). I will argue that he does so.20 First, however, we must examine Arnauld's reasoning. Arnauld summarizes his argument as a dilemma within the scope of the medita tor's hypothesis that "cold is a privation": Lastly, what does that idea of cold, which you say is materially false, exhibit [exhibet] to your mind? A privation? But in that case it is true. A positive being? But in that case it is not the idea of cold. (AT 7:207) On pain of contradiction, my idea of cold represents nothing other than the privation that (by hypothesis) cold is. Hence it is a true idea of cold. Arnauld's dilemma is an instance of the following schema, one that appears in nearly identical form in Suarez's defense of the traditional doctrine that falsity can arise only in judgment, not in "simple appre hension or cognition."21 Premise 1: Either idea i represents x to the mind or it doesn't. Premise 2: If i represents x to the mind, then it is a true idea of jc. Premise 3: If i doesn't represent x to the mind, then it isn't an idea of x at all. Conclusion: i is not a false idea of x. Which idea? Arnauld doesn't specify; he simply refers to it as "a positive idea" and as "that idea [ilia idea]." However, the meditator's own remarks need not be construed as endorsing (2). These remarks are consistent with a simpler, less theoretical conception of how an idea of a non-thing might represent it as a thing. On this conception, that will be the case provided (a) I am inclined to judge, using the idea, that x is a real thing, (b) the idea isn't sufficiently clear and distinct to allow me to discern whether or not x is a real thing, and (c) x is not in fact a real thing. These conditions resemble those given by Field (1993, 316) and Clemenson (2007, 89), though I have avoided appealing to any unexplained notion of "representation." "[EJither such a thing is represented by such an act of cognition or not. If the thing is not represented, it is not the object [of the act] and thus such an act will not be false with respect to it. If however the thing is represented by the act, there will be conformity between them..., whence again such an act will not be false with respect to that object. Therefore the act will not be false in any way with respect to any object" (Suarez 1597/1960-6, 9.1.14/2:181; cited by Wells 1984, 30n27- 8). LIONEL SHAPIRO</page><page sequence="8">To obtain Arnauld's instance of this argument schema, replace 'x' with 'cold', hypothesize that cold is a privation, and assume that if an idea represents a positive entity, then it doesn't also represent a privation. Finally, notice that Premise 3 is equivalent to the left-to-right direction of the biconditional (lb). 1.2 Descartes's Reply: an Equivocalist Reading If we are to make sense of Descartes's reply to Arnauld's dilemma, we need to pay attention to his seldom-noted framing of the dialectical sit uation: Up till now I have attempted to refute [Arnauld's] arguments and to stand up to his attack. But from now I will follow the example of those who are matched with opponents who are superior in strength: instead of meeting him head on I will dodge his blows. (AT 7:231) He adds that Arnauld's points can be readily accepted if they are taken as he himself intends them [facile possunt admitti, prout ipse ilia intelligit]. But I meant the things I wrote in another sense [quae scripseram, alio sensu intellexi], which seems to me to be equally correct. Later, citing Arnauld's identification of the idea of cold with cold itself insofar as it has objective being in the intellect, Descartes remarks "I think we need a distinction." In terms of the rules of disputation he learned at school, he dodges Arnauld's blows by pronouncing distinguo (I distinguish), followed by concedo (I concede) and nego (I deny).22 He concedes the soundness of Arnauld's argument when the words are taken in Arnauld's sense. But he denies one or more of the premises when the words are taken in his own intended sense. In presenting the dilemma argument as an objection to Descartes, Arnauld thus commits a fallacy of equivocation. On rules of disputation, see Ashworth (1988, 166-7), who cites both logic texts that were recommended for use by Jesuit colleges (see Secada 2000, 28). In The Search for Truth, Descartes has the disciple of the Schools proclaim "When [our teachers] feel themselves pressed too hard on some point, an equivocation or distinguo [to distinguo] gets them out of their difficulties" (AT 10:525). Responding in 1638 to a critic who remarks on his reputed "contempt for the Schools," Descartes inserts "distinguo," "concedo totum" and "nego consequentiam" into his French (AT 2:205-7). The reply to Arnauld is another context where he is trying to appear versed in Scholastic ways (cf. AT 7:235 and his uncharacteristic pieces of Aristotle commentary at 242 and 251). OBJECTIVE BEING AND "OFNESS" IN DESCARTES 385</page><page sequence="9">According to the reading I will defend, Descartes applies his distin guo to Premise 3. He concedes this conditional as long as 'idea of x' is taken in Arnauld's sense, but denies this same conditional when 'idea of x' is taken in the sense he himself had intended. And the same holds for the biconditional (lb). Let us call any reading on which Descartes replies to Arnauld's dilemma by distinguishing two senses of 'idea of x' an equivocalist reading. "Throughout the exchange with Arnauld," Anthony Kenny complains, "Descartes appears to be confused about the criterion for the object of an idea."23 On an equivocalist reading, on the contrary, Descartes expressly distinguishes two kinds of object-directedness.24 My task in the rest of this paper is to show that the equivocalist approach makes the best sense of the Fourth Replies passage, and to identify and explain his two senses of 'idea of x'. Consider first how Descartes responds to Arnauld's initial statement of Premise 3. Arnauld writes: "But if cold is merely a privation, then there cannot be an idea of cold which represents it to me as a positive thing" (AT 7:206). Here representing a privation as a positive thing must mean being an "idea of' a privation, yet representing a positive thing to me, in violation of Arnauld's Premise 3 and hence principle (lb). Descartes responds: "When [Arnauld] says 'if cold is merely a pri vation, there cannot be an idea of cold which represents it as a positive thing', it is clear that he is dealing solely with an idea taken in the for mal sense" (AT 7:232). The reason this is supposed to be clear is that "when we think of [ideas] as representing something we are taking them not materially but formally." Here Descartes is invoking common late Scholastic terminology. Suarez writes of two ways one can regard an operation of the intellect: it can be "taken as it were materially, as it is a certain spiritual quality" or "formally, insofar as it refers [refert] the thing ... to the intellect, or insofar as it contains the cognized thing in representative being."25 David Clemenson has recently shown that the Coimbran commentators Descartes studied at school draw the same distinction between 23 Kenny (1968, 245). 24 Pariente (1984, 74-5) reads Descartes as distinguishing between an idea's "idea turn" and its "representative content." Wilson (1990) reads him as distinguishing between "referential representation" and "presentational representation." Wee (2006, 52-76) defends a reading on which an idea's "actual object" (54) may not be the external cause it "represents" (if it does represent anything). See also Nelson (1996) and Smith (2005). These readings differ widely on the nature of the two kinds of object-directedness, how they correspond to Descartes's own terminology, and how they apply to his hypothetical example. 25 Suarez (1597/1960-6, 8.3.16/2:106), cited in Wells (1984, 32n36) and Secada (2000, 98). LIONEL SHAPIRO</page><page sequence="10">"material" and "formal" senses in which we can take an operation of the intellect.26 For Descartes, as for his Scholastic predecessors, talk of ideas "taken in the formal sense" amounts to talk of representation and objective being (in Suarez's case, "representative being"27). An idea of x "taken formally" is an operation of the intellect that represents/exhibits x.28 Recall our earlier simplifying assumption that Descartes identifies this operation with the object x itself insofar as it has objective being in the intellect. In the Meditations' Preface (AT 7:8), the latter is called an idea "taken objectively." Since it won't matter for my purposes which of the two ways an idea is described, I will speak of an idea of x taken formally or objectively, or (for short) an idea ofF/o *-29 Since an idea ofF/0 cold is by definition an idea that represents cold to the mind and through which cold has objective being, Arnauld's principles (lb) and (la) apply as long as the idea of cold is taken for mally or objectively. On an equivocalist reading, Descartes is saying that Arnauld's points should be rejected when the idea of cold is taken in some "other sense" Descartes intended when he raised the possibility of a materially false idea of cold. What is this other sense? Specifically, in what sense does Descartes claim it is a mistake to affirm that "if cold is merely a privation, there cannot be an idea of cold which represents it as a positive thing"? In what sense, that is, does he consider it a mis take to affirm Premise 3? Given his above contrast between the "for mal" and "material senses," the most natural interpretation is that Premise 3 and hence principle (lb) fail when 'idea of x' is taken in the "material" sense.30 Indeed, the material sense is the only sense 26 Clemenson (2007, 43-6). 27 Suarez's preference for 'representative being' reflects a philosophical point. For him, 'containing something in objective/representative being' is a mere fafon de parler for 'representing something'. If we say that a thing has "objective being," he contends, this can only be "by an extrinsic denomination from the cognition which terminates in it" (Suarez 1597/1960-6, 8.1.4/2:78 and 8.1.7/2:80). When Caterus echoes Suarez's language in the First Objections, Descartes responds by insisting that "objective being" is genuinely a mode of being (AT 7:102-3; see e.g. Ayers 1998, 1068 and Clemenson 2007, 52-5). 28 Two readers identify taking an idea formally with regarding it "as something which represents (or fails to represent) something which actually exists outside the intel lect" (Kemmerling 2004, 54 and 1993, 61-4; Field 1993, 310-2). But Descartes doesn't hold that an idea can only represent an actually existing thing (Smith 2005, 212-3). 29 It is crucial not to conflate Descartes's distinction between taking ideas "formally" and "objectively" with his distinction between "formal" (or "actual") and "objec tive" being (AT 7:47). Formal being isn't a matter of representation, whereas taking an idea formally is considering it as representing something. See Nuchelmans (1983, 40). 30 See Field (1993, 322-3), Garcia (1999, 354-6) and Secada (2000, 98-102). OBJECTIVE BEING AND "OFNESS" IN DESCARTES 387</page><page sequence="11">Descartes contrasts with the formal sense in the Fourth Replies pas sage. Of course, I haven't yet explained how we should understand the material sense or examined what Descartes says about it. Until I can do so (in Section 2), I will speak instead of "Descartes's intended sense." We saw Descartes insist that Arnauld's principle (lb) only holds if 'idea of x' is taken in Arnauld's formal sense. A little later, he pleads distinguo in response to (la) as well: "When [Arnauld] says that 'the idea of cold is cold itself insofar as it is objectively in the intellect', I think we need to make a distinction." He concludes with a claim I will be returning to repeatedly: "Thus if cold is simply a privation, the idea of cold is not cold itself insofar as it is objectively in the intellect...." (AT 7:233). Notice that he has explicitly affirmed a scenario where (la) is violated. Such a violation is impossible if 'idea of is taken in Ar nauld's "formal sense." And that, presumably, is why "we need to make a distinction." Once again, Arnauld's point can be "readily accepted if [it is] taken as he himself intends [it]. But I meant the things I wrote in another sense...." I hope it is already clear that the equivocalist approach enjoys sub stantial textual support.31 The main challenge it faces is to explain how taking 'idea of x' in Descartes's intended sense allows him to reject (la) and (lb). I will address this challenge in Section 2. First, however, there is work to be done in fleshing out an equivocalist reading. 1.3 The Hypothetical Scenario We have seen how an equivocalist reading allows Descartes to evade Arnauld's dilemma against the possibility of false ideas. But how does such a reading characterize the hypothetical scenario used in the Third Meditation to illustrate material falsity, the scenario whose coherence Descartes defends as a counterexample to Arnauld's conclu sion? When he quotes Arnauld's formulation of the dilemma, Des cartes refers to the idea that figures in this scenario as "that idea of cold, which I said was materially false [ilia frigoris idea, quam dixi materialiter falsam esse]" (AT 7:234). It will be essential to have a label for this idea that doesn't risk begging questions about the sense in which it counts as "of cold." Let us call this alleged materially false idea MFI. (When discussing what MFI is like, I will always mean what this idea is like in the hypothetical scenario in which it is Much of this support has gone unnoted by equivocalists. Thus Wilson (1990) reads Descartes as distinguishing senses of 'idea of, but doesn't even mention his distinc tion between "formal" and "material" senses. LIONEL SHAPIRO</page><page sequence="12">said to be materially false.) What does Descartes think MFI is an "idea of," in each of the two senses? The passages cited above yield an answer. Provided 'idea of cold' is understood as he himself had intended, Descartes tells us, Arnauld is mistaken in asserting each of the following two claims: "if cold is merely a privation, there cannot be an idea of cold which represents it as a positive thing," and "the idea of cold is cold itself insofar as it is objectively in the intellect." If cold is a privation, Descartes is saying, there can indeed be an "idea of cold" which represents it as a positive thing, an idea which is not cold itself insofar as it is objectively in the intellect. In Descartes's scenario, MFI is such an idea. On the one hand, MFI is (in Descartes's intended sense) an "idea of' cold. On the other hand, MFI is "not cold itself insofar as it is objectively in the intellect"; it does not represent cold. Instead of representing the privation cold which it is an "idea of," it seems, MFI represents a "positive thing." What positive thing might MFI represent/exhibit to the mind? The only plausible candidate is supplied by the continuation of the sentence whose opening was cited above: Thus if cold is simply a privation, the idea of cold [sc. in Descartes's sense] is not cold itself insofar as it is objectively in the intellect, but something else, which I wrongly take for this privation [sed aliud quid quod perperam pro ista privatione sumitur], namely a certain sensation which has no being outside the intellect [sensus quidam nullum habens esse extra intellectum], (AT 7:233) As I propose we parse this sentence, Descartes is saying that what has objective being in the intellect through MFI is not cold itself, but some thing else, namely a sensation. Equivalently: MFI does not represent cold, but something else, namely a sensation. This, I admit, isn't the only natural construal of Descartes's words. On an alternative construal, he is identifying MFI itself as a sensation, rather than saying that MFI represents a sensation. (Previous interpreters have split on which way to read the sentence.32) Moreover, most of my conclusions will be unaf fected if we read Descartes as taking MFI to be a sensation that 32 The parsing I am advocating is found in Wells (1984, 47-8), Wilson (1990, 74), Field (1993, 323-9) and Brown (2008, 207). For the parsing on which the idea is said to be (rather than represent) a sensation, see Hoffman (1996, 369). Clemenson (2007, 90) pursues a third approach: like Hoffman, he parses the sentence as identi fying MFI with "a sensation which has no being outside the intellect," but he takes this to mean a sensation insofar as it has objective being in the intellect. Hence he agrees with me that MFI is an idea ofF/o a sensation. Elsewhere, he clarifies that the sensation that has objective being through this idea is in no way distinct from the idea itself (Clemenson 2007, 140nl4, 77-82; cf. J.-M. Beyssade 1992). OBJECTIVE BEING AND "OFNESS" IN DESCARTES 389</page><page sequence="13">doesn't represent anything at all. Still, there are at least three reasons to prefer my construal. First, it makes better dialectical sense. Descartes is denying that MFI is ofF/0 cold. We would expect him to justify this claim by specifying what (if any) object other than cold MFI is an idea ofF/0- Hence it makes immediate sense for him to inform Arnauld that "MFI is not ofF/0 cold, but rather ofF/0 a sensation." By contrast, it is less immediately clear why he would reply that "MFI is not ofF/o cold, but is a sensation." Here the contrast indicated by 'but' lacks obvious and unambiguous motivation. (Would the point be that sensations don't represent anythingl That they don't represent privations?) Second, my construal explains why Descartes specifies that the "sensation" has "no being outside the intellect." The sensation has objective being in the intellect, but unlike many other objects with such objective being, it can't also enjoy "formal" being outside the intellect. Third, there is a more direct piece of textual evidence. A few para graphs after the above passage, Descartes refers to MFI as an "idea of the sensation of cold [ideam sensus frigoris]" (AT 7:234).33 Let me summarize how the equivocalist reading we have arrived at characterizes Descartes's hypothetical example. Under the hypothesis that cold is a privation, here is what we should say about the "materi ally false" idea MFI: • In the sense Descartes says he intended, MFI is the "idea of' cold (a privation, by hypothesis). • In the "formal" and "objective" senses Descartes attributes to Arnauld, MFI is the "idea of' a sensation.34 To prevent misunderstanding, I should stress a crucial point. We have seen Descartes identify the formal sense of 'idea of as Arnauld's intended sense. All he means is that for Arnauld it is a conceptual truth that an idea is "of' whatever object it represents, i.e. whatever object has objective being through the idea. There is no reason to conclude that Descartes employs the theoretical terminology of 'representation' or 'objective being' the same way Arnauld does. Thus far, I have said nothing about what representation or objective being amount to for Descartes. I have simply argued that an idea can, in his intended sense, be "of' an object other than the object it represents, i.e. other than the object that has objective being through the idea. 33 See Field (1993, 330n23). 34 In Section 2.3, we will see that this characterization is compatible with Wilson's equivocalist reading. LIONEL SHAPIRO</page><page sequence="14">1.4. Against univocalist readings Having laid out a case for an equivocalist reading, I now need to con sider its univocalist rivals. According to these far more prevalent read ings, Descartes's reply to Arnauld's Premise 3 is not distinguo but concedo. Indeed, on these readings Descartes unequivocally concedes (la) and (lb).35 Whatever cold happens to be, that is what the "idea of cold" represents to the mind and what has objective being through this idea. According to univocalists, Descartes avoids Arnauld's conclusion by denying Premise 2. He holds that an idea of x can represent x to the mind yet still be a (materially) false idea. Univocalists differ over how to describe the scenario whose coher ence Descartes defends against Arnauld. There appear to be three pos sibilities, displayed in Figure 1. On the first kind of univocalist reading, MFI represents the supposed privation cold. It counts as materially false because it seems to represent something positive,36 or because it is so confused that it is impossible for me to determine what it repre sents.37 Two other kinds of univocalist reading can be motivated by the thought that a privation can't have objective being or be represented by an idea.38 In that case, assuming univocalism, MFI can't be the idea of cold—even though Descartes refers to it as "that idea of cold, which I described as materially false" (AT 7:234). On one version of this approach, MFI represents a sensation.39 On another version, MFI fails 35 This is stressed by Wells (1984, 44-7), Hoffman (1996, 371), and Clemenson (2007, 86-7). 36 Bolton (1986, 394-5) and Garcia (1999). These interpretations, which distinguish "representing" from "seeming to represent," differ in two ways from the "equivocal ist" reading I am defending. First, they don't adduce the distinction to show how, e.g., there can be an "idea of cold" (in Descartes's sense) that fails to be "of cold" (in Arnauld's sense). Second, since seeming to represent is directly characterized in terms of representing, this isn't an appeal to two basic kinds of object-directedness. These points also apply to the distinction between "direct" and "interpretive" content in Gewirth (1943, 257-62). 37 This seems to be the reading in Nadler (1989, 164-5). See also Secada (2000, 98 102). 38 See Hoffman (1996, 372n31). Clemenson (2007, 78) holds that Descartes does allow non-things (whose existence outside the mind is impossible) to have objective being in the intellect. 39 Wells (1984, 47-8), Field (1993, 329-30), Perler (1996, 55-8, 253n6), Brown (2007, 147-8), and Clemenson (2007, 90). J.-M. Beyssade (1992, 12-14, 18) reads Des cartes as raising the possibility that MFI represents/exhibits only a sensation (namely itself). According to Normore (1986, 229-30), MFI is an "idea of' a sensa tion "by itself being" a sensation, rather than by "presenting us with [one] objec tively."

Since univocalists take Descartes to concede Premise 3, they should say that he is apply ing his distinguo to Premise 2 instead. According to this proposal, an idea may count as a "true idea of' its object in Arnauld's sense, but not in Descartes's sense. One explanation might be that Arnauld takes a true idea of x to be one by which jc is represented to the mind, whereas Descartes takes a (materially) true idea of x to be one by which x not only is but also seems to be represented to the mind.43 Univocalist interpretations of the Fourth Replies passage face seri ous obstacles. One is specific to the second and third univocalist read ings. These readings leave it a mystery why the hypothesis that cold is a privation is even relevant to the material falsity of MFI, which on this reading isn't an idea of cold. Other obstacles apply to all univocal ist readings. For one thing, Descartes doesn't appear to be distinguish ing senses of 'true idea of in the cited texts. Hence it is hard to see how a univocalist reading accommodates Descartes's claim that he is dodging Arnauld's blows by distinguishing senses of words. Most importantly, univocalist readings can't account for his clear insistence that "if cold is simply a privation, the idea of cold is not cold itself insofar as it is objectively in the intellect." To the extent that the orists I have classified as univocalists address the difficulty, they end up making a concession to the equivocalist by claiming that Descartes here 40 Hoffman (1996, 369-72). 41 Field (1993, 229-30), Hoffman (1996, 369-71), Perler (1996, 55-8, 253n6), Brown (2007, 147-8), and Clemenson (2007, 88-91). 42 Wells (1984, 47-8), Normore (1986, 229-30) and J.-M. Beyssade (1992, 12-14). 43 This answer may be implicit in Garcia (1999, 353-6, 368n30). LIONEL SHAPIRO</page><page sequence="16">uses 'idea of cold' in some deviant or non-literal sense. But they haven't adequately explained this sense, the sense in which MFI counts as an "idea of cold." Paul Hoffman, for example, writes that "Des cartes sometimes uses the expression 'the idea of cold' merely as a kind of name for an idea," namely "the idea that we call the idea of cold" even though it does not represent cold.44 But Hoffman doesn't explain why we call it the idea of cold, i.e. why we give the idea this particular name.45 In Section 2, I will argue that 'idea of cold' is not a mere name for MFI but a genuine way of describing the idea's object-directedness. Nonetheless, it will emerge that Hoffman's talk of a "kind of name" contains a key insight. 2. Propositional Ofness and the "Material Sense" I conclude that the equivocalist reading is correct: Descartes distin guishes between an idea's "representing" something to the mind (being an idea of it in Arnauld's "formal" sense) and its being "of' something in the sense he himself intended in the Third Meditation. Furthermore, given how Descartes introduces the "formal" sense by contrasting it with the "material" sense, what we have been calling "Descartes's intended sense" would appear to be the material sense. Yet when we turn to what he says about taking ideas materially, it isn't clear how this can be right. To take ideas materially is to take them "not as rep resenting this or that but simply as operations of the intellect" (AT 7:232). This may seem to imply that when I take an idea materially, I 44 Hoffman (1996, 369, 371). Clemenson's answer is that when "we" (author and reader of the Fourth Replies) call MFI 'the idea of cold', all we mean is that it counts as such when 'cold' is understood the way "he" (the Third Meditation's meditator) uses the word. MFI is the idea "he has been calling 'idea of cold'," Clemenson writes (2007, 90), yet it is not in fact of cold "if by 'cold' we mean the absence of corporeal motion." The problem with this reading is that Descartes's aim, in explaining why MFI is false if cold is a privation, is to defend the medita tor's original claim against Arnauld's charge of incoherence (pace Wee 2006). Hence "we" can't take ourselves to mean anything different by 'cold' than "he" does when he says 'if cold is merely the privation of heat...' 45 This is the main reason I haven't classified Hoffman as an equivocalist. Like my equivocalist, Hoffman claims that Descartes "is using the expression 'the idea of cold' in two distinct senses" (1996, 369). Unlike my equivocalist, he sees one use as involving a mere name, rather than a way of describing the idea's object-directed ness. (Furthermore, Hoffman doesn't regard distinguishing these two senses as Des cartes's key move in reply to Arnauld. As he reads Descartes, the distinction between representing and seeming to represent is more important.) OBJECTIVE BEING AND "OFNESS" IN DESCARTES 393</page><page sequence="17">don't consider it as being an "idea of' anything in any sense.46 I will argue that understanding Descartes's remarks about the material sense requires rejecting this seeming implication. First, I need to show how Descartes appeals to an ordinary, pretheo retical way of attributing ofness. Since ofness thus conceived will be explained in terms of "propositional attitudes," I call it propositional ofness. In Section 2.1, I show that this conception corresponds to how Descartes explains what he means by an "idea of' something, and I explain how it is central to his epistemology. In Section 2.2, I argue that an idea of something "taken materially" should be construed as an idea of something in the propositional sense. 2.1. Propositional Ofness Writing to Mersenne in 1641, the year of the Meditations' publica tion, Descartes expresses frustration with objections conveyed from an anonymous "person who asks what I meant by the word 'idea'" (AT 3:382). By that word, he explains, he means "everything which is in our mind when we conceive something" (AT 3:392-3). In par ticular, my idea of God is what I conceive when I use the word 'God', my idea of the soul is what I conceive when I use the word 'soul', and so forth: Is it possible that [the objector] could not, as he says, understand what I mean by the idea of God, the idea of the soul, and the ideas of imperceptible things? I mean only what he must necessarily have understood himself when he wrote to you that he did not understand my meaning. For he does not say that he conceived nothing by [n'ait rien conceu par] the expressions 'God', 'soul', 'imperceptible things'; he just says that he did not know what was to be understood by the idea of these things. But if he conceived anything by [s'il a conceu quel que chose par] these expressions, as he doubtless did, he knew at the same time what was to be understood by the ideas—namely nothing This point was stressed by a referee. Making sense of Descartes's claim that he is taking ideas "materially" isn't a challenge only for equivocalist readers. Univocal ists have proposed at least four readings, none with textual support. Wells (1984, 46-9) sees Descartes's claim that he is taking ideas "materially" as evidence that he is concerned not with what objects they represent, but with whether their represen tational status is "defective." Garcia (1999, 354-6) holds that taking an idea "mate rially" is considering it with regard to what it seems to represent. Others hold that one is considering an idea "materially" as long as one isn't considering it as repre senting an extramental object (Secada 2000, 98-102) or an actually existing extra mental object (Field 1993, 322-3). These last readings can't be correct. Descartes denies that Arnauld is taking ideas materially, yet Arnauld is contemplating an idea that represents a privation, the standard example of a "being of reason" with no possible extramental existence. LIONEL SHAPIRO</page><page sequence="18">other than the very thing [cela mesme] he conceived. (AT 3:392; emphasis added) Descartes's elucidation of the notion of the idea of something thus starts with a correspondence between ideas and words: (3) The idea I conceive when using the word 'x' is the idea of x.41 One paragraph later, he writes: [W]e cannot express anything by our words, when we understand what we are saying, without its being certain thereby that we have in us the idea of the thing which is signified by our words. (AT 3:393; emphasis added) This formulation simply generalizes over all instances of the schema (3). If I conceive anything at all when I use the word 'God', I have the idea of God, and if I conceive anything at all when I use the word 'soul', I have the idea of a soul, etc. (Of course, nothing prevents some one else from using these noises or marks to express ideas of entirely different things. Descartes assumes that this isn't the situation he and his critic find themselves in with regard to 'God' and 'soul'.) The gener alization of (3) just cited appears nearly verbatim in the Second Replies, appended to Descartes's definition of 'idea' as the "form of any given thought" (AT 7:160). It isn't hard to identify Descartes's rationale for (3). Whenever I use the words 'God is a deceiver', understanding what I am saying, I am entertaining the thought that God is a deceiver. And my idea of God, in the pretheoretical sense Descartes is here elucidating, is just the idea that figures as the relevant component of that thought's overall "form."48 This explains why he is perplexed by his critic's inability to grasp his sense of 'idea of x'. Whoever understands what it is to affirm that God is infinite or believe that God exists, he writes, understands what it is to have the idea of God (AT 3:393-4, reiterated several years later at 9A:210). He makes the same point to Hobbes in connection with a second example: [B]y an idea I mean whatever is the form of a given perception. Now everyone surely perceives that there are things he Cf. Perler (1996, 13-14). Kemmerling (1993, 45) formulates a variant of (3) in which 'the word "x"' is replaced by 'a word that refers to x.' This obscures the non-theoretical nature of Descartes's elucidation. For thoughts as having composite forms, see AT 7:37. OBJECTIVE BEING AND OFNESS IN DESCARTES</page><page sequence="19">understands. Hence everyone has the form or idea of under standing.... (AT 7:188; emphasis added) We can elucidate this conception of what it is for an idea to be "of something" using a second, more fundamental schema, one that no longer refers to words: (4) An idea of x is an idea one can employ (as the relevant ele ment in one's thought) in entertaining the thought that ... x .... I will call such an idea an idea of x in the propositional sense, or (for short) an idea ofP x. The ideas I express when I use my words 'God' and 'soul', understanding what I am saying, are ideas ofP God and ofP the soul. We have seen Descartes invoke propositional ofness to explain what he means by 'idea of. Propositional ofness is also essential to the use he makes of his theory of ideas, because it is presupposed by his method of obtaining knowledge by the contemplation of ideas. Steven Nadler notes that the "doctrine of objective being ... is the fulcrum on which Descartes is able to move from his ideas" to the existence of God in the Third Meditation.49 I will now argue that propositional of ness is in turn the fulcrum on which Descartes moves from his ideas to the existence of God in the Fifth Meditation. When defending his ver sion of the ontological proof, he repeatedly endorses an inference rule: (5) Premise: Being F is contained in the idea of x. Conclusion: It is true that x is F. 50 For example, "whatever I apprehend as being contained in the idea of a triangle—for example that its three angles are equal to two right angles—I can with truth assert of the triangle" (AT 7:117; cf. 6:36, 49 Nadler (1989, 157). 50 Like (3), (5) appears in one of the Second Replies' definitions: "When we say that something is contained in the nature or concept of a thing, this is the same as say ing that it is true of that thing, or that it can be asserted of that thing" (AT 7:162). In view of its role in the proof that God exists (AT 7:166-7), this "definition" can't be regarded as stipulating how Descartes uses a technical term. LIONEL SHAPIRO</page><page sequence="20">7:65, 8A:10 and 8B:361).51 In later writings, Arnauld rightly stresses the importance of rule (5) to Cartesian epistemology: he goes so far as to report that Descartes "holds it with reason to be the foundation of all the natural sciences."52 What sense does 'idea of x' have in the rule's premise? Suppose I use the rule to conclude that a triangle's angles sum to two right angles. I do so by investigating the content of some idea. Which idea? The only idea whose content seems relevant is the "idea of a triangle" I use in drawing my conclusion that a triangle's angles sum to two right angles. In other words, it is the idea ofP a triangle. Hence, if this infer ence rule is to have any plausibility, the 'idea of x' that figures in its premise must be understood as an idea of x in the propositional sense.53 Furthermore, the usefulness of the inference rule depends on its 51 Descartes states a number of similar inference rules; my claims will apply to all of them. In a letter from 1642, he explains a general "rule" followed in the Medita tions'. "I take great care ... not to attribute to things anything positive which I do not first perceive in the ideas of them. But I think also that whatever is to be found in these ideas is necessarily also in the things themselves" (AT 3:474-6). He then applies this methodology to yield the following inference rule: (5a) Premise: The idea of y is "joined to" the idea of x "in such a way that I cannot [clearly and distinctly] think of the two together while denying the one [y] of the other [x]." Conclusion: x can't exist without y. A third rule is endorsed in a letter from 1641: "Our only way of knowing whether two things are different or identical is to consider whether we have different ideas of them, or one and the same idea" (AT 3:285; cf. 7:422-3). (5b) Premise: The [clear and distinct] idea of x is different from (identical to) that of z. Conclusion: x is different from (identical to) z. Here, the "difference" between x and z need amount to no more than a "distinction of reason." For Descartes appears to recognize diverse clear and distinct ideas whose objects are not "really distinct" (AT 4:350). 52 Arnauld (1683, 49-50). Compare Arnauld and Nicole (1662, 327 and 317-8): "all the certainty and evidence of our knowledge in the natural sciences comes from this principle." 53 It may seem that this can't be right. Suppose the idea I express by 'triangle' con tains circularity. This idea is an idea ofP a triangle. I have argued that it follows by rule (5) that a triangle is circular. Isn't this implication a problem for my interpre tation of Descartes's rule? Let me explain why not. Since triangles aren't circular, rule (5) simply yields a reductio ad absurdum of the supposition that the idea I express by 'triangle' contains circularity. The possibility of such a reductio might itself seem absurd. But we need to distinguish two statements: (a) I use the word 'triangle' to express an idea containing circularity. (b) I could have used the word 'triangle' to express an idea containing circularity. An alleged reductio of (b) would indeed be absurd, but rule (5) yields a reductio of (a). Notice that (5) doesn't yield that if I had used 'triangle' to express an idea con taining circularity, I could have inferred from this that a triangle is circular. For in that counterfactual circumstance, I wouldn't have used 'triangle' to express the idea ofP a triangle. (The objection answered in this note was raised by a referee. My reply is indebted to Yablo 2002.) OBJECTIVE BEING AND "OFNESS" IN DESCARTES 397</page><page sequence="21">invoking propositional ofness. Say I am trying to determine whether a triangle's three angles sum to two right angles. To use rule (5), I need to investigate what is contained in my idea of a triangle. To do so, I first need to know which of my ideas is the idea of a triangle. The prop ositional conception allows me to determine this immediately. The idea ofp a triangle is none other than the relevant idea I am employing in asking whether the angles of a triangle sum to two right angles, the idea I just now expressed by my use of the word 'triangle'.54 Though the propositional sense of 'idea of is central to Descartes's theory of ideas, it has not been explicitly identified in the literature on Cartesian ideas. In the next section, I will argue that it is the key to understanding his reply to Arnauld on material falsity. For this rea son, it is important to avoid a natural misunderstanding of my eluci dation of propositional ofness. Schema (4) does not say that what an idea is "of' is a matter of what it can be used to think of. Rather, it says that what an idea is "of' is a matter of what it can be used to think that. It would be unhelpful to elucidate the "ofness" involved in having an idea of something in terms of the "ofness" involved in think ing of something. For if 'idea of turns out to have two senses, the same will hold for 'think of. By contrast, Descartes does not recog nize two senses of 'think that'. There is no sense in which the thought I now express by 'God is a deceiver' can fail to be the thought that God is a deceiver." 2.2. Ideas Taken Materially Recall that equivocalist readers owe an explanation of how an idea "taken materially" can count as "of cold" even if it does not represent cold to the mind. Here is how Descartes introduces the material sense: If ... we were considering [ideas] not as representing this or that but simply as operations of the intellect, then it could be said that we were taking them materially, but in that case [sc. taken in the material sense] they would have no regard to [nullo modo ... respicerent] the truth or falsity of their objects. (AT 7:232) Kemmerling (1993, 68) describes Descartes's assumption that "a certain [idea] he finds in his mind" is the idea of God as a "presupposition that is never up for dis cussion" in the Third Meditation. But here too the meditator identifies his idea by explaining how he understands the name 'God' (AT 7:45). Kemmerling (2004, 44-5) comes close to identifying (4) as a rationale for early modern talk of ideas: "Take any meaningful word ... and put 'idea of in front of it, and you have a phrase which refers to a mental item ... which can be used in thinking." What thinking? If the word is 'Harvey', he adds, the thinking is "about Harvey." This just trades 'of for 'about', but Kemmerling does note that we use an idea of existence when we "think that ideas do not exist." LIONEL SHAPIRO</page><page sequence="22">How can taking a given idea simply as an operation of the intellect allow me to make sense of the possibility that the idea is of cold without representing cold to my mincP. Let us see whether we can answer this question if we suppose that considering an idea of cold materially just means considering it as an idea of cold in the proposi tional sense. When I consider my idea of cold materially rather than as "repre senting this or that," we are told, the idea thus considered has "no regard to the truth or falsity" of its object. Here "truth or falsity" means metaphysical reality or unreality.56 On the reading I will now propose, Descartes's point is this: (6) I can recognize a particular operation of my intellect as my idea ofP cold without claiming that the object this operation represents to my mind (a real being, say, or a mere priva tion) is what cold is. That is because it suffices that the idea is the operation of my intellect I express by my word 'cold'. Inquiry into cold's nature—inquiry that might settle whether cold is a real being or a privation—can never reveal that this idea of mine is not in fact an idea ofP cold. In short, what cold turns out to be is irrelevant to which among my present ideas is the idea ofP cold. We can express this as a feature of the propositional sense of the expression 'idea of x'. Construed in the propositional sense, 'my idea of cold' is an epistemically rigid expres sion: it picks out the same operation of the intellect across all epistemic scenarios, all ways the world might turn out.57 The epistemic rigidity of the expression 'my idea ofP cold' captures what is right about Hoff man's remark that "Descartes sometimes uses the expression 'the idea of cold' merely as a kind of name for an idea." The reading I have just proposed is confirmed by the prima facie puzzling continuation of the passage cited above: Thus, whether cold is a positive thing or a privation, I do not on that account have a different idea of it, but there remains in me the same one I have always had [non aliam idcirco de ipso habeo ideam, sed ma net in me eadam ilia quam semper habui\. (AT 7:232) For Descartes's conception of ontological "truth" as reality, see Wells (1984, 31-2), who cites AT 5:356-7. Later in the Fourth Replies passage (AT 7:234), Descartes uses 'res vera' (a true thing). I am using terminology from Chalmers (forthcoming). OBJECTIVE BEING AND "OFNESS" IN DESCARTES 399</page><page sequence="23">Is Descartes really saying that there may be no intrinsic difference between an idea of a positive thing and an idea of a privation? Claim (6) suggests a more plausible interpretation. Whether cold turns out to be positive or not doesn't affect which of my present ideas turns out be my idea of cold "taken materially," i.e. my idea ofP cold.5S In this way, my idea ofP cold "remains the same one" regardless what cold turns out to be. By contrast, which of my present ideas turns out to be ofF/0 cold may depend on what cold turns out to be. Depending on what cold turns out to be, a "different idea" may turn out to represent cold to my mind and be cold itself insofar as it is objectively in my intellect. To call any given idea the idea of cold in the "formal" or "objective" sense is to venture a judgment that might be proven false by further inquiry. We can now understand why Descartes writes that to take the idea of cold materially is to consider it simply as an operation of the intel lect. When I say that "the same idea" will be my idea ofP cold regardless what cold turns out to be, this is true if 'same idea' means same operation of my intellect. By contrast, it is false if 'same idea' means same idea construed formally or objectively. For my idea ofP cold might turn out to be the idea ofF/0 a positive thing or the idea ofF/0 a privation, which are two different ideas construed formally or objectively. 2.3. The Basic Difficulty According to Descartes, then, the following is an epistemic possibility from my perspective as meditator in the Third Meditation: inquiry into the nature of cold might reveal that my idea ofP cold (an idea I use when I entertain the thought that cold might be a privation) is not the idea ofF/o cold. Here, once more, is his statement of this point: Thus if cold is simply a privation, the idea of cold [sc. taken materi ally as Descartes says he intended] is not cold itself insofar as it is objectively in the intellect, but something else, which I wrongly take for this privation, namely a certain sensation which has no being out side the intellect. (AT 7:233) If cold is a privation, he is saying, my idea ofP cold is not the idea ofF/0 cold. Rather, according to the reading defended in Section 1.3, it is the idea ofF/0 a sensation. What an idea is "of' when "taken Here I disagree with M. Beyssade (1994, 234), who reads Descartes as saying that whether my idea of cold is materially false doesn't depend on whether cold is a positive thing or a privation. LIONEL SHAPIRO</page><page sequence="24">formally" and "objectively" might diverge from what it is "of' in the prepositional ("material") sense. In discussions of equivocalist readings, ofnessF/0 has sometimes been viewed as the less problematic of the Fourth Replies' two ofness es. The burden of those who attribute to Descartes a "twofold scheme of intentional representation," it has been thought, lies in explaining how an idea can be "of' an object in a way that contrasts with that object's being exhibited to the mind.59 Consider Wilson's exposition of equivocalism. Here is how she explains Descartes's claim that MFI "is not cold itself insofar as it is objectively in the intellect, but something else..., namely a certain sensation": The idea is, referentially, the idea of cold; it presents, however, some thing else: a mere, if "positive," sensation.60 When Descartes denies that MFI is ofF/0 cold, Wilson reports him as denying that it "presents" cold. Wilson's presentation thus corresponds to my ofnessp/o, which we have seen Descartes call exhibition (hence Wilson's term). She refers to Descartes's contrasting second sense of 'idea of as "referential." But she complains about the obscurity of ref erential ofness. While she speculates that Descartes's remarks reflect an inchoate "causal account," she is "not going to claim that the notion of referential representation is ultimately a clear one."61 If I am right, the situation is exactly the reverse. The ofness that contrasts with ofnessF/0 is prepositional or "material" ofness, the everyday notion Descartes insists his anonymous critic understands per fectly well. The real difficulty lies in accounting for the role of of nessp/o, the notion Descartes calls "exhibition to the mind" and Wilson calls "presentation." If the object an idea is ofF/0 need not be the object it is "of' in the ordinary propositional sense, it is unclear what purpose talk of objective being is meant to serve in a description of thought's bearing on the world. This, I believe, is the basic difficulty posed by the Fourth Replies passage. 59 Clemenson (2007, 3). Clemenson himself holds that the only notion in the vicinity is mere "non-intentional" signification (65, 71, 75-6, 91). Similarly, Menn (1995, 200n27) holds that Descartes's sensory "idea of cold" is "neither an external res nor the lack of one objectively present in my mind, but only a conventional sign, with no intrinsic objective content..., which God has arbitrarily established in my mind to signify the cold in bodies." 60 Wilson (1990, 74). 61 Wilson (1990, 74-5). She does allow that the notion of "presentational representa tion" may not be "free of problems" either (8In 10). OBJECTIVE BEING AND "OFNESS" IN DESCARTES 401</page><page sequence="25">3. Intentional Divergence 3.1. Referring an Idea to Something it Doesn't Conform to In Section 4, I will propose an explanation of the role objective being plays in Descartes's account of cognition. First, however, let us exam ine how my version of equivocalism makes sense of the remainder of Descartes's reply to Arnauld. Call any circumstance in which an idea fails to be ofF/0 the object it is ofP a case of intentional divergence. I will start by showing that Descartes recognizes intentional divergence as a common predicament, not just an epistemic possibility. Here is the key text, this time unelided: When [Arnauld] says that the idea of cold 'is cold itself insofar as it is objectively in the intellect', I think we need to make a distinction. For it often happens in the case of obscure and confused ideas—and the ideas of heat and cold fall into this category—that an idea is referred to something other than that of which it is in fact the idea. Thus if cold is simply a privation, the idea of cold is not cold itself insofar as it is objectively in the intellect, but something else, which I wrongly take for this privation, namely a certain sensation which has no being outside the intellect. The same point does not apply to the idea of God, or at least to the idea of God which is clear and distinct, since it cannot be said to be referred to [referri ad\ something to which it does not conform [cui non sit conformis], (AT 7:233) What "often happens" with obscure and confused ideas is a divergence between the object an idea is "referred to" and the object it is "in fact the idea of," namely the object it "conforms to." How does this vocab ulary map onto Descartes's two senses of 'idea of? What an idea conforms to is the object that has objective being through that idea, the object the idea is "formally" of.62 Hence what often happens with obscure and confused ideas is that the idea is Descartes doesn't object when Gassendi links objective being to conformity. Gass endi writes: "It is commonly said that external things ... are 'objectively' or 'ide ally' in the intellect; ... you appear to follow this usage and mean simply that an idea must conform to the thing of which it is an idea" (AT 7:285). See also Wells (1984, 29-34). Of course, an idea need not conform to something that actually exists as its cause (AT 7:37, 81-2). LIONEL SHAPIRO</page><page sequence="26">referred to an object despite not being the idea ofF/0 that object.63 Descartes explains this common predicament using his hypothetical example MFI. This idea ofP cold, we are told, does not conform to cold. It is "not cold itself insofar as it is objectively in the intellect," whence (in a nod to Arnauld's usage) Descartes describes it above as not "in fact" of cold. Due to the idea's confusion, however, it is "referred to" cold. Generalizing from this example, we can state Descartes's claim as follows: (7) It often happens that an obscure or confused idea ofP x is referred to x despite not being the idea ofF/o Whatever 'refer' may mean, that would be a case of intentional diver gence. And in view of the traditional definition of truth as "the confor mity of thought with its object" (AT 2:597), it is unsurprising that Descartes would describe any idea ofP an object that fails to conform to that object as a "false" idea of it.64 In the Third Meditation, Descartes equates "referring" ideas to things with "judging that [they] resemble, or conform to" the things (AT 7:37). Something like this use of 'refer' appears to be in play in the Fourth Replies as well.65 When I refer my idea ofP cold to cold, I take the idea to conform to cold. Supposing cold is a privation, this is a mistake: the idea does not in fact conform to cold, it "is not cold itself insofar as it is objectively in the intellect" (as argued in Section 1.3, the idea is actually ofF/0 a sensation). But does Des cartes credit ordinary thinkers with judgments concerning what their ideas are ofF/0? His talk of "referring" may instead just be a way of summarizing how intentional divergence accounts for false judg ments concerning, e.g., cold. Consider his terse description of how, Here I endorse the analysis of Garcia (1999, 355-6, 368n30). But Garcia and I apply referral and conformity in reverse: she holds that MFI conforms to the sup posed privation cold, and is referred to a sensation. This conflicts with Descartes's denial that MFI is "cold itself insofar as it is objectively in the intellect." Others who read Descartes as saying that MFI is "referred to" a sensation overlook his contrast between "referral" and "conformity": Normore (1986, 229), Camp (2002, 18), De Rosa (2004, 265), and Smith (2005, 219). For the Scholastic view of falsity as "difformity between a cognition and the thing that is its object," see Suarez (1597/1960-6, 9.1.14/2:181, 9.1.17/2:184) and the Coimbrans (in Doyle 2001, 166-7). In the Second Meditation, by contrast, the meditator uses 'referre' for the action he performed when he previously "attributed" various features to the soul (AT 7:26). This appears to be the sense used in Principles I, article 48 (AT 8A:23) and Passions I, articles 22-25 (AT 11:345-8), where Descartes speaks of "referring" [referre/rapporter] sensations to their external causes, to the body, or to the soul. See Wilson (1990, 79) and Brown (2008, 209-11). OBJECTIVE BEING AND "OFNESS" IN DESCARTES 403</page><page sequence="27">if cold is a privation, the idea I express by 'cold' can occasion a false judgment. The idea's obscurity "gives me occasion to judge [mihi dat occasionem judicandi] that this idea of the sensation of cold represents some object called 'cold' which is located outside me" (AT 7:234-5). The only real judgment, I am suggesting, is to the effect that cold is something positive outside me. This judgment is occasioned by a confusion between the idea's divergent representa tional and propositional objects: I "wrongly take" the positive sensa tion (whose intramental nature I fail to discern) for cold.66 No explicit judgment concerning what the idea represents/exhibits would appear to be required: [0]wing to the fact that [the idea of cold] is obscure and confused, I am unable to judge whether or not it exhibits to me something posi tive which is outside of my sensation [an mihi quid exhibeat quod extra sensum meum sit positivum, necne\. And hence I have occasion to judge that it [?] is something positive though it [?] may merely be a privation [ideoque occasionem habeo judicandi esse quid positivum, quamvis forte sit tantum privatio]. (AT 7:234) Descartes's reasoning here is obscured by what appears to be an impli cit grammatical subject, which I have followed John Cottingham in rendering by two instances of 'it'. Their referent can't be the idea, since no idea can be a privation. By means of an insertion in his translation of the first sentence, Cottingham himself produces a different referent: what the idea exhibits to me.61 But I have argued that what the idea MFI exhibits to me in the relevant hypothetical scenario isn't a priva tion either. Instead, 'it' may refer to cold—after all, it is cold that is a privation in this scenario. The potential error, in that case, is my judg ment that cold is something positive. Descartes follows a Scholastic tradition in distinguishing between the falsity of judgments and a second kind of falsity that can belong to In taking the sensory idea expressed by 'cold' to involve a confusion of two distinct objects the idea is simultaneously "about," I follow Camp (2002, 17-22). According to Camp, however, Descartes is committed to identifying both of the distinct objects as cold, whence he "really needed a logic in which identity is permitted to branch." My equivocalist reading carries no such implication: cold is the object the idea is ofp, not the object the idea is ofF/0. The CSMK translation reads: "... I am unable to judge whether or not what it rep resents to me is something positive...." J.-M. Beyssade (1992, 14) suggests striking the insertion I have italicized on grounds unrelated to mine. LIONEL SHAPIRO</page><page sequence="28">concepts insofar as they provide occasion for false judgments.68 Yet it isn't easy for traditional theorists, including Arnauld, to explain how a concept or idea that is not a misrepresentation of some object (in virtue of not being a representation of it at all) can lead the mind to judge falsely that the object is thus and so.69 We have now seen how Des cartes's appeal to two kinds of object-directedness gestures at an expla nation of how a confused idea can provide the occasion for its own use in a false judgment. 3.2. Possible Examples of Intentional Divergence So far, our only example of intentional divergence has been a hypotheti cal scenario raised by the meditator in the Third Meditation, the scenario containing the idea MFI. While Descartes defends the coherence of this scenario against Arnauld, there is no reason to think he regards the sce nario as actual—since there is no reason to think he affirms that cold is a privation.70 Yet he holds that intentional divergence "often happens in the case of obscure and confused ideas." What actual cases might he have in mind? Clearly, we should look among materially false ideas. (Later, I will ask whether all and only materially false ideas are cases of intentional divergence.) And we must look beyond our own ideas. The "occasion" one's materially false idea gives for error depends on one being "unable to judge" what it represents. Hence one will be unable to establish that one's own materially false idea is a case of intentional divergence, i.e. rep resents something other than the object it is an idea ofP.71 In this section, I will suggest four possible examples of other people's ideas that Descartes regards as suffering from intentional divergence. In none of the cases is the textual evidence decisive, though it is suggestive. And the examples will be useful in motivating my general explanation of objective being in Section 4, an explanation that will in turn support my analysis of the examples. Clemenson (2007, 82-5) points out that the Coimbrans speak of a "per accidens" falsity that can belong to a simple cognition insofar as it "gives an occasion ... to the intellect to perceive one thing for another and to make a false judgment" (in Doyle 2001, 170-1; see also 168-9). He is right (143n31) that this is "far closer to the spirit of Descartes's remarks" than is Suarez's discussion of falsity taken "materially," to which Descartes defers for his terminology (AT 7:235). But I would add that Suarez too (1597/1960-6, 9.1.16/2:182) recognizes "per accidens" falsity in the sense used by the Coimbrans. 69 For the best reconstruction of how Arnauld thinks such a mistaken judgment arises, see J.-M. Beyssade (1992, 10-12). On his reading, our judgment employs a sensory idea that is not of cold (despite being "what we feel when we say 'It is cold'"), together with a second idea that is of cold. 70 See e.g. Hoffman (1996) and Nelson (1996). 71 See Field (1993, 316). OBJECTIVE BEING AND "OFNESS" IN DESCARTES 405</page><page sequence="29">Consider, first, what Descartes himself might say about the con fused sensory idea a non-philosopher expresses by 'cold'. Though he never explicitly says so, he may hold that this is the idea ofP a qual ity in bodies. In that case, the quality in question—the quality the non-philosopher calls 'cold'—will be some geometrical mode of exten sion (e.g. a state of motion), though the non-philosopher won't realize this. At the same time, I have argued, Descartes takes the idea to be ofF/0 a sensation with no possible extramental existence. (This sensa tion, rather than the quality in bodies, may be what Descartes himself calls 'cold'.)72 On the assumption that the non-philosopher's idea is ofP a quality in bodies, therefore, that idea will supply a case of actual intentional divergence that closely resembles the meditator's hypothetical example (except for involving a geometrical mode in place of a privation). Are there other candidates for intentional divergence? After explain ing that the possibility of intentional divergence "does not apply to the idea of God which is clear and distinct," Descartes adds that "the con fused ideas of gods which are concocted by idolaters" might be "called materially false, insofar as they provide the idolaters with matter for false judgments" (AT 7:233). However, these needn't be understood as cases of intentional divergence. Arnauld had claimed that when idola ters "transfer" their idea of God to an idol, the falsity lies only in judg ment (AT 7:207). Descartes may just be responding that if one doesn't realize, e.g., that one's idea of a mighty golden calf is "made up at will," one may be occasioned by this idea to judge falsely that a golden calf is mighty (cf. AT 7:117-19).73 His next example of a materially false idea, the thirst that leads the dropsical patient "to judge that a drink will do him good, when in fact it will do him harm" (AT 7:234), There is reason to think Descartes would regard his own use of 'cold', 'red', etc. as ambiguous, as sometimes expressing the idea ofP a sensation and at other times the idea ofP a mode of body. On the one hand, he writes that "colours, smells, tastes and so on ... are merely certain sensations which exist in my thought" (AT 7:440). On the other hand, he describes color and taste as "qualities which stimulate the senses [sensus movent]," and "depend simply on the exterior surface of bodies" (AT 7:254; cf. 3:649- 50 and 11:346). In Principles I, articles 66-71, he may be distin guishing color as a sensation from "what colour is in a [seen] body" ("quid in [visoj corpore sit color") or "what is called colour in objects" (AT 8A:32-6, cf. 8A:322-^). Compare the Coimbrans' illustration of one way a "simple cognition" can be the "occasion for forming a false proposition." We are told that "the intellect in con ceiving this definition, a four-footed rational animal, is false for the reason that it is false in forming this proposition, Some rational animal is four-footed. Therefore ... the first cognition is false, because it is the cause of the second" (in Doyle 2001, 168-9). LIONEL SHAPIRO</page><page sequence="30">also fails to be a clear case of intentional divergence. Intentional diver gence needn't be the only reason an idea provides occasion for error and counts as materially false.74 Still, a 1645 letter does suggest that Descartes contemplated inten tional divergence in pagan religious thought. When the ancients named [nommoient] many gods they did not mean many all-powerful gods, but only many very powerful gods, above whom they imagined a single Jupiter as sovereign; and consequently, to this Jupiter alone they applied [appliquoient] the idea of the true God, this idea being presented to them in a confused manner. (AT 4:188)75 The confused idea a pagan expresses by 'luppitef is the idea ofF/0 God that is "imprinted on the human mind in such a way that every one has within himself the power to know him" (AT 4:187). In what sense does the pagan "apply" this idea to Jupiter? I suggest that 'apply to' is used the way 'refer to' is used in the Fourth Replies. The pagan wrongly takes his idea to conform to Jupiter—he con fuses the true God to whom the idea conforms with the object the idea is ofP, namely Jupiter, which leads him to attribute to Jupiter perfections belonging to the true God.76 Though his idea is ofF/0 God, it is an idea of Jupiter in the propositional sense elucidated by schema (4): when he announces 'Iuppiter est subiectus fatis', he is expressing the thought that Jupiter (not God) is subjected to the Fates.77 The pagan's situation contrasts with that of the First Meditation's meditator, described in a letter as someone "who imagines God to be a deceiver—even the true God but not yet distinctly known," i.e. "under stood only in a confused way" (AT 4:6478). This person has a confused Indeed, it is possible that (contrary to my above suggestion) Descartes doesn't think any actual sensory ideas are materially false due to intentional divergence. Perhaps the sensory idea a non-philosopher expresses by 'cold' is ofP a sensation, not a qual ity of bodies. It can still count as materially false if its confusion leads the non-phi losopher to conceive of that sensation as a possible quality of bodies. See J.-M. Beyssade (1992), Field (1993), and Brown (2007; 2008). This passage is discussed by Wee (2006, 56-7). Whether this idea "represents a non-thing as a thing" depends on whether Jupiter belongs in the category of "chimeras, which we suppose cannot have any existence [quorum existentia nulla esse posse supponitur]," not even "possible existence" (AT 7:383). I have drawn the example from a 1630 letter (AT 1:145). I am translating from the Latin text in Verbeek et al. (2003, 174-5). As the editors explain, the text in AT 4:62ff (the text translated in CSMK) is a retranslation into Latin of a French translation of Descartes's Latin original. OBJECTIVE BEING AND "OFNESS" IN DESCARTES 407</page><page sequence="31">idea ofP the true God. There is no reason to think his idea is a case of intentional divergence. Nor will it provide occasion for error, since he "uses it only to enlighten the intellect, and to recognize the nature of God himself more clearly, or demonstrate it to others." On the other hand, a passage in the Fifth Replies may point to an idea ofP the true God that is a case of intentional divergence. Here Descartes first distin guishes ideas of "the true God" from ideas of "false Gods," explaining that the latter ideas either include features that don't belong to God's essence, or exclude perfections that do belong to God's essence. He then adds: But once the idea of the true God has been conceived, although we may detect additional perfections in him which we had not yet noticed, this does not mean that we have augmented the idea of God; we have simply made it more distinct and explicit, since, so long as we suppose that our original idea was a true one, it must have contained all these perfections. (AT 7:371; emphasis added) I suggest we take the proviso I have italicized literally. Descartes isn't merely reiterating that the idea must be of the true God. Rather, he requires that it be a true idea of this God. The contrast would be a false idea of the true God, in particular an idea ofP God that doesn't conform to God. Examples might be the ideas conceived by some observant but unthinking Christians who have yet to access their innate idea ofF/0 God. Such people may nonetheless trust that God will protect them, which requires conceiving an idea ofP God. Unlike the idea a pagan priest expresses by 'Iuppitef, however, this idea may not be God himself insofar as he has objective being in the intellect. So far, then, we have encountered what appear to be three categories of confused ideas: A. Confused ideas that are materially false on account of their intentional divergence (possible examples: the sensory idea a non-philosopher expresses by 'cold', the idea a pagan priest expresses by 'Iuppiter\ the ideas some unthinking Christians express by 'God') B. Confused ideas that are materially false but are not cases of intentional divergence 408 LIONEL SHAPIRO</page><page sequence="32">(possible examples: the idolater's idea of his idol, the drop sical patient's thirst) C. Confused ideas that are neither materially false nor cases of intentional divergence (the idea of a deceiving God as used by the meditator) Might an idea be a case of intentional divergence without being materi ally false? If my idea ofP x were like this, I would have to be able to clearly and distinctly perceive that it doesn't conform to x. Otherwise, it would afford occasion for mistaken judgment and count as materially false. But such perception is only possible if the idea is clear and distinct. And there is good reason to deny that intentional divergence is possible for clear and distinct ideas. Indeed, I will propose in Section 4 that this is the key to explaining the role of objective being in Descartes's theory. First, however, let me tentatively suggest a final candidate for inclu sion in category A, from the Third Meditation: [TJhere are two different ideas of the sun which I find within me. One of them, which is acquired as it were from the senses ... makes the sun appear very small. The other idea is based on astronomical rea soning ... and this idea shows the sun to be several times larger than the earth. Obviously both these ideas cannot be similar [similis] to the sun which exists outside me; and reason persuades me that the idea that seems to have emanated more proximately from the sun itself is the most dissimilar to it [illam ei maxime esse dissimilem, quae quam proxime ab ipso videtur emanasse]. (AT 7:39) Here Descartes uses an example addressed by the Coimbran commenta tors in a passage that prefigures Arnauld's argument. To the objection that "a peasant falsely apprehends the sun as smaller than the earth," they reply that this is not a case of "falsity in a simple concept" (as opposed to a proposition). For that would "falsely suppose" that the object of the peasant's concept is the real sun. Rather, the Coimbrans contend, "the object ... is an imagined sun which is less than the whole earth."79 Might Descartes agree that the ordinary sensory "idea of the sun," which is so dissimilar to the sun, is really ofF/o a vastly smaller disk? If so, this idea would fail to be ofF/0 the sun; it would fail to be "the sun itself existing [objectively] in the intellect" (AT 7:102).80 This 79 In Doyle (2001, 162-3 and 172-3). See Wells (2003, 27-30). 80 Clemenson, who doesn't cite the Coimbran example, also reads Descartes's sun example this way (2007, 71). For a reading on which the idea is ofp/o 'he sun, see Hoffman (1996, 376-7). OBJECTIVE BEING AND "OFNESS" IN DESCARTES 409</page><page sequence="33">would resemble Descartes's concession to Arnauld that if cold is a priva tion, our sensory "idea of cold" fails to be the idea ofF/0 cold. The hypothesis I have just suggested will indeed follow from the general explanation of objective being I offer in Section 4. But there is also a piece of textual evidence. In his Fifth Objections, Gassendi criticizes Descartes's "example of the sun, of which you have two ideas," one of which is "more similar to the sun and truer [similior ac verior]" (AT 7:283). Gassendi objects: "But both these ideas of the sun are similar to the sun and are true, or conform to the sun, though one does so more than the other." (As so often, his target is Descartes's distinction in kind between sensory images and intellectual ideas.) In reply, Descartes criticizes Gassendi for "taking the two ideas as one on the grounds that they are referred to only one sun" (AT 7:363). In denying that the "two ideas [are] one," Descartes may be rejecting the view that both ideas—though differing greatly in accuracy of represen tation—are the sun itself insofar as it has objective being in the intellect. The difference between the sensory and intellectual ideas is more radi cal than this, he may be telling the empiricist Gassendi. Nonetheless, he agrees that both ideas are "referred to" the sun. In the words of the Fourth Replies, the sensory idea may be "referred to something to which it does not conform." If the ordinary sensory idea is not in fact ofF/0 the sun, in what sense is it an "idea of the sun"?81 The equivocalist reading I have defended provides an easy answer: it is an idea ofP the sun. Yet this idea can be wrongly taken to conform to the sun—"referred to" the sun—rather than to the vastly smaller object it is in fact ofF/0. Unlike Arnauld or the Coimbrans, Descartes is in a position to explain how an idea that is not ofF/0 the sun can lead the mind to judge falsely that the sun is smaller than the earth,82 Figure 2 summarizes the candidates I have identified for inclusion in category A of ideas that are materially false on account of intentional divergence. Clemenson (2007, 71) concludes that this is a case where "phrases such as 'idea of A' mean 'idea caused by A' or 'idea commonly taken to intentionally represent A'." His first suggestion is ruled out by the meditator's doubt about the existence of bodies, and his second suggestion isn't a credible explanation of what the medi tator "means" when he reports finding "two ideas of the sun." Since it can supply occasion for mistaken judgment—even to astronomers (AT 7:440)—the ordinary sensory idea should also count as materially false (it is taken this way by Wells 1994, 147). Notice that it doesn't belong to the class of materi ally false ideas described in the Third Meditation: those that represent a non-thing as a thing.

Objective Being 4.1. Objective Being and Reflective Correction We are finally ready to address the basic question posed by Descartes's reply to Arnauld. What role does objective being play in his account of cognition, if it can diverge from propositional ofness? Surely, he doesn't appeal to objective being merely in order to explain the possi bility of mistaken judgments. Rather, in explaining these errors, he appeals to a notion that plays some more fundamental role. Further more, it must at least be intelligible how he can claim to perceive the truth of the causal principle used in the Third Meditation's proof of God's existence. According to this principle, the "reality" possessed "formally" by an idea's cause can be no less than the reality possessed "objectively" by whatever has objective being in the intellect through that idea (AT 7:40-1). My suggestion is that the role of objective being can only be under stood in light of Descartes's rationalism. Here I don't mean his view that contemplation of the contents of, and relations between, clear and distinct ideas is a source of a priori knowledge. That view is shared by philosophers with quite alien outlooks: notably Locke, who thinks obtaining clear and distinct ideas requires no more than being attentive and avoiding sloppy use of words.83 I have in mind, rather, a view Tyler Burge ascribes to the "rationalist tradition": the view that "thought can correct meaning" and thereby give rise to "ideal under standing."84 According to Descartes, reflection of the sort exemplified by the Meditations can ultimately yield clear and distinct ideas. The 83 Locke (1689, ch. 2.29 and 4.1, and Epistle to the Reader, 12-14). 84 Burge (1986, §4). OBJECTIVE BEING AND "OFNESS" IN DESCARTES 411</page><page sequence="35">object such an ultimately achieved idea is ofP, I now propose, is none other than what is already objectively present in the intellect at the start of the process, in such a way as to be accessible by the proper method ology of reflection. What needs causal explanation is the presence in this sense of an object in the intellect. In short, when a confused idea is ofF/0 some object, the explanatory role of this "ofness" is to account for the possibility of reflective correction that yields a clear and distinct idea ofP that same object: (8) If i is an idea ofF/0 then there is a process of reflection that takes the mind from i to a resulting z" that is a clear and distinct idea ofP x. Starting with a confused idea, the mind can be led through reflection to arrive at a clear and distinct idea ofp whatever object already had objective being in the intellect through the initial idea. The initial idea might already have been ofP the object in question, as in the case of the meditator's idea ofP a deceiving God. In a case of intentional diver gence, however, the initial idea will have been ofP something else. Let me work out the implications of (8) for three of our possible cases of intentional divergence from Figure 2. I start with the pagan priest's idea ofP Jupiter. In virtue of this idea's being God himself insofar as he has objective being in the pagan's intellect, the pagan is in principle capable of reflectively clarifying the idea to yield a clear and distinct idea ofP God. Next, consider the sensory idea an ordin ary thinker expresses by 'cold'. I have suggested that this may be a confused idea ofP a quality of bodies which the Cartesian philosopher recognizes to be a mode of extension. Yet, if my reading of the Fourth Replies is correct, Descartes claims that this same idea is the idea ofF/0 a sensation. According to (8), then, reflection starting with this confused idea can yield a clear and distinct idea ofP that mind dependent sensation. This construal fits well with Principles I, article 68: In order to distinguish what is clear in this connection from what is obscure, we must be very careful to note that pain and colour and so on are clearly and distinctly perceived when they are regarded merely as sensations or thoughts. (AT 8A:33) Descartes may be saying that we are saddled in childhood with con fused sensory ideas ofP bodily qualities, qualities we call 'red' and 'cold' though we "have no way of understanding what sort of things they are" (ibid.). Careful attention to the ideas allows us to transform some 412 LIONEL SHAPIRO</page><page sequence="36">of them into clear and distinct idea ofP mere sensations—the sensations these ideas were all along ofF/0- In order to clearly and distinctly understand the qualities of bodies, however, we need to learn to employ entirely different ideas—purely intellectual ideas ofF/0 extension and its modes. Finally, consider Descartes's example of the two "ideas of the sun." Reflection on one's ordinary sensory idea ofP the sun will never yield a clear and distinct idea ofP the sun—at best, it will yield the idea ofP a disk far smaller than the earth. Achieving a clear and distinct idea ofP the sun requires "astronomical reasoning" involving non-sensory ideas of geometrical simple natures.85 Hence, according to (8), the ordinary sensory idea is not in fact an idea ofF/0 the sun; it is not the sun itself insofar as it has objective being in the intellect. My interpretation of objective being thus entails the hypothesis suggested in Section 3.3, according to which this idea is a case of intentional divergence. 4.2. Clear and Distinct Ideas I have explained the role of objective being in Descartes's theory of cognition in terms of his notion of a clear and distinct idea. For this explanation to be helpful, it is important that clarity and distinctness not themselves be characterized in terms of objective being. Principle (8) will be unilluminating if an idea's clarity or distinctness concerns the manner in which the idea represents/exhibits an object to the mind. I will propose instead that an idea's clarity and distinctness can be understood in terms of its propositional ofness. As Descartes defines clarity and distinctness in Principles I, article 45, a perception's clarity is a matter of its being "present and accessible to the attentive mind," whereas distinctness additionally requires that it be "so separated and detached [ita sejuncta ... &amp; praecisa] from all other perceptions that it contains within itself only what is clear" (AT 8A:22). Following Clemenson, I take him to be saying that an idea's distinctness, its demarcation from all other ideas, is "bound up with the clarity with which the various essence-parts of its object are repre sented."86 As Clemenson shows, the Coimbran commentators regard a concept of man as distinct only when it is explicitly the concept of a rational animal. Similarly, on this reading, Descartes regards an idea of body as distinct only when it is explicitly the idea of extended substance. Which of our two intentional notions does this 'of correspond to? The answer should be apparent from my discussion in Section 2 of 85 Cf. Clemenson (2007, 68-9). 86 Clemenson (2007, 72-5). For a similar suggestion, see Alanen (2003, 159). OBJECTIVE BEING AND "OFNESS" IN DESCARTES 413</page><page sequence="37">inference rule (5). Whenever Descartes links consideration of what is contained in an idea "of something" to facts about that thing's essence, this 'of must be understood in the propositional sense. Formulated in terms of propositional ofness, the above elucidation of distinctness amounts to this: (9) An idea ofP x counts as sufficiently distinguished from all other ideas (and sufficiently distinguishes x from all other objects) when it perspicuously reveals, in virtue of what it is ofp, the metaphysical constitution of x. For example, I only attain a distinct idea ofP body when the fact that the idea in question is the idea ofP extended substance becomes avail able to my attentive mind (cf. AT 7:440). My idea ofP body might thus be confused in two different ways. First, I might not notice that it is the idea ofP extended substance. I may still need to "draw out from an innate idea something which was implicitly contained in it but which I did not at first notice in it" (AT 3:383). But there is a worse predicament: my idea ofP body might not be the idea ofP extended substance at all! Our above candidates for intentional divergence all display this more radical kind of confusion. No matter how attentively we contemplate our ordinary sensory idea ofp the sun, this won't reveal the sun's constitution. And if what a non-philosopher calls 'cold' is indeed a quality in bodies, contemplation of the materially false sensory idea she expresses by 'cold' won't reveal that quality's nature. 5. Conclusion I have argued that Descartes appeals to objective being as part of his theoretical explanation of the mind's ability to attain clear and distinct ideas. My conclusion reveals a surprising feature of Cartesian episte mology. Consider again a hypothetical pagan priest who by carefully meditating on the idea he expresses by 'Iuppiter' comes to know that existence belongs to God's essence. Present-day philosophers of mind are accustomed to ask: is this a case of learning more about the same object, or is it a case of changing the topic? To most philosophers, Des cartes's answer will clearly look like the latter. After all, the priest does not come to know that existence belongs to Jupiter's essence. In the ordinary sense associated with propositional attitude ascriptions, he has replaced his idea "of' Jupiter with an idea "of' God. According to Descartes, however, there is an alternative sense in which both ideas are "of' the same object—both ideas are God himself insofar as he has 414 LIONEL SHAPIRO</page><page sequence="38">objective being in the intellect. What is distinctive and interesting about Descartes's appeal to objective being, I have argued, is this divorce between ordinary intentionality and a kind that is introduced to do explanatory work in his rationalist account of cognition.87 References Adam, Charles and Paul Tannery, eds. 1964-76.
