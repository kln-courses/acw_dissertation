The indivisible space-time of relief is defined by five dimensional coordinates: time, three coordinates of Euclidean space, coordinate expressing the group of characteristics, that is the level of organisation achieved. Because of the indivisible nature of space-time geomorphology needs to rediscover the significance of time. Introduction In many subjects the unity of space-time is affirmed in numerous publications, but the affirmations resemble the introductory comments to dialectical materialism made by Russian scientists during the Communist Period in that no further reference is made to the theme. Rarely in geomorphology is an interconnection made between spatial and temporal properties. This is due to the fact that the concept of space-time unity was not developed by geomorphologists, but appeared as an highly abstract and philosophical general scientific hypothesis (Akundov 1974; Bunge 1970; Vernadsky 1988; Grunbaum 1969; Urmantsev, Trusov 1958, etc.). It is therefore necessary to absorb this hypothesis into geomorphology, by investigations within the discipline, in order to advance both the theoretical and the applied subdivisions. The examination of real unity of the space-time dimensions will afford new opportunities for the description of geomorphological structures, the establishment of new models of relief, and a new approach for the construction of geomorphological maps. Descriptions of relief in which abstract references are made to space-time, but relief is nevertheless considered as it is, must be replaced by a search for order-disorder (symmetry- dissymmetry). The assertion of W. Leibnitz can be accepted in this context: space is the order of coexistance, time is the order of succession. In order to achieve this examination of the unity of space-time dimensions relief must be analysed to select spatial and temporal characteristics or groups of characteristics, emphasising the space-time element. The elaboration of a methodology will be in step with the formulation of the theoretical base. It is necessary to study the conditions of existence of the relief of the earth's surface from relativist positions. Initial Reflections The main problem we face initially stems from the fact that the relief of the earth's surface is the sole source of information. Its properties are studied in order to establish methods of observation and measurement which are then employed to study the spatial and temporal characteristics of the relief. There is a circularity or relativism which makes reference to absolute space and absolute time impossible. Furthermore the properties which carry information about form also carry information about time. Relief is considered as the complex of accidents on the upper surface of the lithosphère, but it is solely a surface, real but without substance.</page><page sequence="2">356 GeoJournal 34.4/1 994 Fig 1 Analysis of slopes on western coasts of Svyatoy Nos peninsula, Lake Baikal. 1. piedmont alluvial fans, 2. basal facets, 3. intermediate facets and summit facets, 4. badlands in upper valleys During the investigation of space-time features the investigator encounters various common problems, the first of which is associated with the intuitive knowledge of space and time. Science generally provides only vague and ambivalent definitions of these common concepts, but they are fundamental to any concrete scientific investigation, in this instance in geomorphology. St. Augustine can be qouted in this context: "We know well what time is until we need to explain it to another person." (Moltchanov 1977). Our reflections on space-time in nature are on the one hand impeded by this inbuilt vagueness, but on the other hand the disability is also a spur to constant thought, ample justification for our efforts. This age-long vagueness has also affected our scientific language. Terms based on mistaken constructions have come into use and have had the effect of making absolute the concepts they represent. For example the term "geomorphological space" must be interpreted literally as the space within which the science exists, but is intended to convey the space within which relief exists, and reflects the concept of absolute space. A better term would be "space of relief, for this would limit our methodological confusion. It is necessary therefore to reflect upon the selection of terms; geomorphological system, or system of relief, geomophological time or time of relief. Concepts relating to geomorphology as a science must be differentiated from concepts relating to the subject matter: relief and correlative sediments. Theories of space-time are necessarily part of the theory of geomorphology; useful but difficult to perceive and to realise practically. For practical realisation and for further theoretical advance there must be a return from abstraction to reality, an "earthing" of the concept. Reality is the spatial-temporal unities of the relief of the earth's surface, and to describe it adequately some basic concepts must be suggested. The Three-Dimensional Space of Relief The analysis of relief has both topological and mensurational aspects. The latter includes the establish- ment of the parameters for form and location. Every facet of relief has height, length and width, defined by triaxial co- ordinates. This substantiates the claim that the relief of the earth's surface is three dimensional, in spite of the fact it is incorporeal. This definition of relief by co-ordinates does not involve geomorphological concepts. The parameters used are common to science. The same applies to the transformation of the information to deal with rates of relief-forming processes, a task which appears, outwardly, quite routine. In the analysis of topological properties, however, a complex of geomorphological problems is presented. The relationships between relief elements can be described in ways which are supplementary to each other. The relationships include vicinity, inclusion, transition and combination. They are purely spatial, but temporal relationships are included by age ranking. Evolutionary and genetic linkages unite both spatial and temporal relationships, emphasising the indivisible nature of the linkage. The prinicipal task of the topological analysis of relief is to reveal the basic features of its spatial structure, the combination of forms, and disturbances to these combinations. The emphasis is on the order-disorder, or more strictly the symmetry-dissymmetry in the relief (Fig 1). Order is here described by the repeated combination of forms. A simple example is the regular interchange of valley and interfluve in humid areas. It is necessary to emphasise that geomorphological terminology dealing with asymmetry is far from reality, and simply reveals an ignorance of the concept of symmetry. There is need to distinguish morphological from structural asymmetry. Changes in inclination distort the structural order, but the structural regulation is maintained. Generally order in the structure of complex natural objects can be described within the thesis of curvilinear symmetry. This applies even to crystals which have constant angles even though the faces may be of different sizes. If there be a morphological asymmetry in some relief forms then use of this asymmetry to describe complex assemblages of forms appears to lack sense. The prevalence of order in the relationships between relief forms, which can be described briefly, suggests this, the use of order is the more economical approach, and allows a more careful analysis of disturbances to this order. Definition of the elements of symmetry, and the loss of that symmetry, permit a movement towards genetic explanation. Geomorpho- logical explanation can be based on the universal principle of symmetry: an object retains its own symmetrical characteristics which are common to the location of its formation (Shafranovsky 1968). Particularly interesting are the relationships within a morphogenetic system. If the order in the relief is defined then there is an opportunity for a reconstruction of the controls of the morphogenetic process, and their alteration because of climatic zonation or tectonic transformation. Loss of order suggests the operation of peculiar morphogenetic processes. Relief</page><page sequence="3">GeoJournal 34.4/1994 357 Fig 2 Reoccurring combinations of landforms in mountainous relief. Western slope of Barguzin ridge, seen form Lake Baikal range of geomorphological investigation, being paleogeo- graphic reconstructions with dissimilar circumstances. In the stream of absolute time the present relief of the earth's surface must be considered perpetual. Nevertheless some of the forms have only recently appeared, and are peculiarities which cannot be used in relation to discussion as to age. For the existing relief, and the individual landforms, the subject matter of geomorphology, for the definition of age it suffices to indicate the moment of appearance. Relative time is used in the majority of scientific concepts which have defined the formation and methodology of geomorphology. The theory of the geographical cycle outlined by W. M. Davies (1899; 1962) divides relief into morphological types to each of which a temporal sense is attached. A sequence of forms or stages in relief is detected, each form or stage appearing as the result of the transformation of its predecessor (Fig 3). Time is relative. A discussion of the geographical cycle from the viewpoint of geomorphology will not be entered open here. The piedmont steps of W. Penck (1924; 1961) constitute as definite succession of relief stages following upon a succession of morphogenetic events. Subsequent elaboration of this thesis by L. King (1967; 1982) produced a scale of events that related to the geological time scale. According to the terminology of Yu.A. Urmantsev and Yu. P. Trusov (1961) King's work exemplified the character of the relationship between the geological age of the relief, and its own individual time. L. King (1967) showed the succession of relief stages, clearly observed and traced in the southern continents, fragments of Gondwanaland, and definded the geological age of each beginning with the so-called Gondwanian planation surface (Fig 4). D.V. Borisevitch (1985) considered that this surface and latter surfaces were of a greater age than that proposed by King. This dating problem was taken up in the Russian journal "Geomorphology", but the succession of stages of relief and their own time scale, the time involved in their formation, were not considered. That is to say the principal feature of the thesis stimulated no discussion, testifying as to the significance of "own time", that is the time particular to the construction of different relief features, in our generalisations. In dealing with the geomorphological stage of the earth's development (Gerasimov, Meshcheryakov 1964) dissymetry is a basis for the detection of deep-seated changes in the lithosphère, and of geodynamic conditions, with the possibility of prognosis of geomorphological hazard risk. The structural analysis of relief (without implying the relationship with geological structure) implies measure- ment of relief forms, definition of their co-ordinates and their relationships, and the relation of order-disorder (symmetry-dissemmetry). Special terms are required to deal with this spatial organisation of the earth's relief (Fig 2). Spatial organisation is the main feature of the structure of relief in the three dimensional Euclidean space. Time and Relief Absolute and relative time are here distinguished. The latter applies in relation to evolutionary sequences of landforms, each stage considered as part of a sequence. The typical example of the use of the concept of relative time is the geographical cycle of W. M. Davis (1962 - this is the date of the Russian reprint, the original paper was published in 1899). Often the development of relief is considered in geological time, which has (according to the type of relief) the attributes of absolute time, although normally the time element is considered as independent without reference to absolutes. This is discussed in relation to questions on the age of relief, its longevity or duration (Florensov 1976; Khudjakov 1970; Ganeshin et al. 1970; Seliverstov et al. 1990). Another aspect of the use of geological time is the anthropomorphism of the measurements. The physical methods of investigation of rocks led to the calculation of geological time in millions of years, and led to self- deception as to the nature of time, giving it anthropo- morphic qualities. Domestic chronology is based on cyclical processes, whereas time is a succession of events (Bunge 1970; Molchanov 1977; Lebedev 1970; Meyen 1989). Even in absolute or geological time relief has only one essential quality, and we must therefore consider sceptically the opportunities for its usage in anthropolo- gical chronology. Relief for us, as the earth, is perpetual. Even if we imagine the disappearance of relief features, or witness rapid change due to human activity or natural catastrophe, past forms of a similar kind are outside the</page><page sequence="4">358 GeoJournal 34.4/1 994 Fig 3 Genetic succession of landforms following alongshore slope destruction and large scale collapse. Western coast of Lake Baikal near North Kedrovy Cape especially in the revised edition (Gerasimov 1970) the individual time periods associated with a temporal succession of morphogenetic events was considered but not in depth, although a scale is given. The name morphological stage was employed because of the connection with the geochronological time scale. A comparison of the concept of relief stages, as outlined by W. Penck and L. King, with the concept of geomorphological stages of the earth's development, as outlined by I. P. Gerasimov and Yu. A. Menshcheryakov, is provocative. Both concepts use similar time intervals, but differ in their presentation of the succession of morphogenetic events. Why has this contrast arisen? In fact the concept of relief stages was developed by King (1967; 1982) in the southern continents, fragments of Gondawanaland, where such stages are present. For the geomorphologist working with the relief of Laurasia, as for example the author of this paper, King's photographic illustrations produce a sense of incredibility. In the northern continents, despite the presence of planation surface of various ages, piedmont surfaces showing three or more stages of relief are only rarely encountered. The temporal succession suggested by I. P. Gerasimov (1970) consists of peneplain, planation surface close to rivers, and valley terraces. Both concepts may be considered objective but relate to different individual time. Probably the relief of the ocean floor is associated with a further individual time. Different temporal successions of relief are to be found in different parts of the world, and problems of correlation resemble those of stratigraphy but are much more complex. It is clear therefore that temporal characteristics, deriving from the properties and relationships of relief elements, are of importance to geomorphological theory, but this is not a matter of geological definition based on the exposure of constituent rocks. There is a contradiction between temporal successions of relief forms used in geomorphological generalisations and the use of geological dating with attributes of absolute time. Normally the age of a relief is considered in terms of its</page><page sequence="5">GeoJournal 34 .4/1 994 359 Fig 4 Different landform sequences associated with individual time of relief: morphological succession of Gondwanaland A.

Initial peneplain (a), valley pediments (b) and valley terraces (c) in Laurasia length of time of survival, and its place in the time sequence as part of a succession of events is relatively neglected. In comparison with geology (Meyen 1989) the age of the element is considered but not its chronology. This contradiction necessitates the adoption of the form of wording used by I. Prigozhin (1989): is not the rediscovery of time in geomorphology to be based on a regional approach? There is of course no question of replacement of geologic time by some other methodolo- gical construct. Absolute or geological time has established the mensuration system that has led to the solution of many problems. It resembles the use of absolute time by I. Newton. The problem is to search for ways of relief analysis based on its own time structure. This consists in my opinion of establishing the concept of the individual time, that is to say the relativist time, of the relief deriving from its own properties. This would lead to a structure of space- time for the time study of relief, free from any internal contradiction. The individual time of relief must have one essential quality - it must be the expression of its inherent properties, and have a material expression. It is not an invisible stream in which events are bedded, but a shaft imprinted in a definite succession of forms, a causal relationship reflecting the order of time (Reinbach 1962). How can the individual time of relief be discerned? The following reflections on this problem may be of value. Time is a succession of events, an event is a unit of time. An element of relief is the trace of the event in a succession of forms. Necessary is the construction of successions of forms, and the recognition of chronometers, followed by the correlation of successions and the establishment of a world succession. From this the temporal succession of relief forms could be formulated, providing the material base for the shaft of time in relief. This type of concept was earlier proposed (Ufimtsev 1986) as a morphological succession, with a natural combination of relief elements, dealt with in terms of law inferred from temporal relationships based simply on earlier or later. These laws of temporal succession for relief forms are different for accumulative relief as against erosive relief, as against sedimentary rocks compared with intrusive rocks. For erosive relief the law distinguished by V.V. Dokuchayev holds true: the higher the form the greater its age (Fig 5, 6). The construction of a morphological succession resembles the analysis of the spatial organisation of relief. If, as in the last case, the morphological succession is distinguished then the opportunity is presented for definition, interpretation and the distinction of aberrations, asymmetrical/symmetrical relationships (Fig 7, 8). The morphological succession in the analysis of relief can be approached in two ways. First it can be considered as the trace of time in relief, forming a series of mor- Fig 5 Multistage relief of Olkhon Island, Lake Baikal. 1. pre-orogenetic peneplain (Cretaceous-Paleogene). 2. valley pediplain (Neogene). 3. Recent valleys</page><page sequence="6">360 GeoJournal 34.4/1994 Fig 6 Normal succession of landforms; Inselberge, Neogene planation surface and young erosional features on western coast of Lake Baikal south of the Olkhon Vororta Strait phogenic events, to which can be applied an appropriate terminology. Second the morphogenic succession can be considered as materialising the individual time, integrally connected with it by the spatial organisation. In the second approach a unified space-time is being considered and it is this second approach that is here adopted. Let us consider the main properties of the individual time of relief. The most important is the fact that if the morphologic succession is in progress, the individual time of relief is invariable. Indeed it is so invariable that it can be related to absolute geological time. The morphological succession can be applied to any point on the scale of geological time, as the discussion of the age of surfaces in Gondwanaland illustrates. The second important feature of individual time of relief is the non-event and timeless character of parallel displacements in the relief sequence (Fig 9). These displacements do not disturb the individual time nor dislocate the succession. In spite of changes in the dimensions of elements we can estimate an eventlessness time stream from the dimensions of the piedmont and breaks in the continuity of the time stream revealed by the succession of planation features. In many cases geologic or absolute time and the individual time of relief run in the same direction, in accordance with natural laws, in particular in the entropy processes (Khoking 1990). But there is at least one situation, here named the temporal paradox of planation (Fig 10), where this is not true. Geological time relating to slope-pediment sequences is defined according to the stratification of the correlative sediments. This would imply that the regressed slope is younger than the pediment because weathered products removed from it form the uppermost of the correlative sediments. The individual time of a pediment sequence will appear paradoxical: the slope appears and its regression forms the pediment. As regression of the slope takes place the temporal relations between it and the pediment remain unaltered. Thus geological time and individual time of relief move in opposite directions. In view of the fact that pediplanation is so important in the genesis of relief this paradox needs examination. The main problem of the construction and usage of individual time of relief is associated with the creation of a world morphological succession, that is world time of relief. In turn this presents two second order problems. The first of these is the establishment of the theory and methodology of morphological correlation: the second is the provision of morphological chronometers. These problems resemble those of stratigraphy, but are more complex in that we are dealing with a surface, which unlike the subject matter of geology is non-material. To establish correlation of the local or regional morphological successions landform chronometers must be distinguished, to play a role similar to that of the zone fossils. For the author this concept, despite its clarity, remains difficult in application, especially when dealing with intercontinental relief correlations. In the southern continents and in Laurasia we see two differing types of morphogenesis. We now reiterate our aim in the discernment of relief time. Absolute or geologic time permits the definition of age, and the duration of a land feature, and this information can be used in further reconstructions. Individual time of relief introduces the structural Fig 7 Break in the normal morphological succession: subhorizontal shore-level feature of Pleistocene glacial lake, dissecting the fault scarp on the southern flank of the Ulan-Makit Basin in the north-east of the Baikal Rift zone</page><page sequence="7">GeoJournal 34.4/1994 361 Fig 8 Break in normal morphological succession: intermediate facets (2) high up valley formed on fault scarp after facets (1) as the result of destruction of tabular block between two lines of displacement (3) talus (4) depositional feature due to collapse and the badlands (5) above parameter, the interchange of events, the abrupt change of the land-shaping process. The combination of parameters, duration and interchange of process, allows us to investigate all the temporal features of the relief of the earth. The parameters supplement each other, permitting description of both the mensurational and topological characteristics of relief time. The rediscovery of time of relief introduces new opportunities for geomorphological theory construction. The aphorism of Bernard Shaw is appropriate here. There is only one way to overcome time: establish new ideas which find striking expression (Priroda 1978, 11, p. 160). Although the concept of time presents particular difficulties for science, now and in the foreseeable future, since it appears intuitively based, nevertheless the very difficulties associated with the concept act as a stimulus for further investigative thought. Individual time of relief, its morphological succession, forms an indissoluble unity, its spatial organisation based on common and interrelated parameters of relief. It is in this that we see the real unity of the spatial temporal properties of relief; four dimensional with the three spatial dimensions shot through with time. Additional Properties of Space-Time of Relief In the relief of the earth's surface as well as a morpho- logical succession there is an hierarchical succession or order, with relief considered in terms of level of organisa- tion (Fig 11). As in the case of morphological succession there are specific peculiarities linked with the hierarchical order, the essence of which will now be condidered. Co- ordinate axes of three dimensional Euclidean space have the symbol + or-, time of relief is the shaft of time, but the hierarchical order of relief is characterised by a double directional arrangement with grouping into higher rank assemblages, or division into lower rank assemblages. Another peculiarity of the hierarchical succession or order of relief is its visible influence on both temporal and spatial properties. This is exemplified by the mistake made in traditional geomorphology due to the attachment of solely a temporal quality to the hierarchical succession, as Fig 9 Invariable character of morphological succession as individual time of relief with landforms resulting from parallel retreat with the ordinal classification of valleys (Phylosophov 1960) with the direct proportional dependence of order on age. There are many concrete examples of this reasoning. It is however necessary to recall that order in valley form is connected also with the dimension which defines the volume of correlative sediments and their age interval. The hierarchical order is characterised by symmetry deriving from step by step grouping of relief forms. Each step has a certain minimum necessary quantity of form, the spatial organisation of which produces the higher level in the hierarchy. It carries the need to distinguish main structure-forming distinctions from additional elements of the same type which increase only dimension, that is to distinguish qualitative from quantitative change. Study by the author of the tectonic relief in East Siberia, in particular in the Baikal Rift Zone, led to the conclusion that a grouping "three or more" is peculiar to this type of ordering system (Fig 12). The minimum number of main elements, the next level of organisation, is three. For this approach to be valid there is a need to distinguish the main from the intermediate or additional levels of organisation of the earth's relief. Only the former include spatial- temporal assemblages. The main and the intermediate levels alternate with the grouping division of the main levels formed by a three element step. This regularity explains why a decimal ranking is effective. The three or more element defines the symmetry of the hierarchy, and stems from a mathematical approach. Another peculiarity of this type of ordering is the availability of morphologically similar forms at different levels, as characterised by symmetry. This latter characteristic suggests that it is due to a particular state of relief space, in particular its curvature. The geometrical image of relief space in this dimension may be spiral. The hierarchical order is also characterised by abrupt breakpoints. As certain levels of organisation the same indicators apply, but between groups of levels something approaching a classificatory barrier exists. These characteristics of hierarchic order, the presence of breaks and the influence of curvature, are, in our opinion, real. Developing the concept it may be suggested that features of space of the earth's relief are peculiar to it as three-dimensionl Euclidean space, and the bulge of Riemann's space. The hierarchic succession may be considered as a specific dimension of the space of relief. If this be so, then the space of relief has another spatial co- ordinate, the grouping of forms. This leads to the conclusion that relief is four dimensional.</page><page sequence="8">362 GeoJournal 34.4/1 994 Fig 10 Time paradox associated with pediplanation. Geological time of the pediment is greater than that of the back-slope. Morphological succession (own time of relief) consists first of the slope, and then the pediment as the slope retreats Five Dimensional Space-Time of Relief This then leads to the concept of a five-dimensional space- time relief. Its main spatial properties are to be described in terms of three-dimensional Euclidean co-ordinates with sign, that is to say having negative or positive values. The specific properties of relief space are described by the co-ordinate representing grouping, and this is bilateral. The fifth co- ordinate represents the shaft of time: it is without sign but is directional. The use of these five co-ordinates provides the best means of characterising the structure of the indivisible space-time of the relief of the earth's surface. Abstract reasoning on the indivisibility of the space- time of relief can be translated into firm description of its spatial temporal structure by means of three fundamental concepts: spatial organisation, hierarchic order or succession, and morphological succession. On the basis of these concepts a descriptive system can be established which deals satisfactorily with the problems of description of the earth's relief. The concept of morphological succession as an individual time of relief is of great significance. Because of its usage during regional generalisation, in parallel with geological age, the means are provided of characterising the topological properties of relief time, in particular event interchange, without loss of the sense of indivisibility of space-time. This concept must therefore be employed in regional geomorphological investigations and generalisations, and in the production of geomorphological maps. The author also entertains the hope that the application of this concept will rewaken interest in regional geomorphology which has diminished in the last 15-20 years, as is evident in the Russian publication "Geomorphology". The development of geomorphology as a science is dependent upon the Fig 12 Successive grouping of interfluvial montane massif. Section III-2 is being reduced and has insufficient surviving elements. Zunduk intermediate step on western coast of Lage Baikal, south-west of the Ami Cape tig 1 1 Hierarchic succession, grouping or basal, intermediate and summit facets into large facets forming the fault scarp on the northern flank of the Chara Basin, north-east of the Baikal Rift theory and the field investigations relating to regional geomorphology. Realisation of the concept of the indivisibility of space-time should be reflected in the legends of geomorphological maps, with indications of morphological and hierarchical successions. Spatial ordering of relief is already well shown on some existing geomorphological maps, especially those of genetically homogenous surface (Ermolov 1964). Thus the relief of the earth's surface and its indivisible spatial-temporal properties can be characterised in terms of the concept of a five-dimensional space-time of relief. The concept should be of value in the development of theoretical geomorphology, and in stimulating interrest in regional geomorphology. This article does not contain any discussion of relief genesis. This theme requires a separate paper. The author has already made preliminiary analysis of the theme revealing its contradictory character (Ufimtsev 1992). The conclusion was reached that the genesis of relief defines the conditions for the united space-time of relief, but that must be the subject of another paper.
