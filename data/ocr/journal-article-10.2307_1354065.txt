<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAPTER 6 RECONSIDERING THE ROOM OF THE LADIES AT AKROTIRI by Suzanne Peterson Murray Of the many buildings with wall paintings that have been uncovered at Akrotiri, one of the most problematic is the House of the Ladies.1 A large, heavily damaged structure at the north end of the site, it was once an imposing three-story building with a central light well and as many as ten rooms on each floor (Fig. 6.1). Fragments of wall paintings recovered from the building originally decorated a paved, upper-story room in its north- ern section, Room 1. Two separate programs of decoration have been dis- tinguished, corresponding to the excavator's division of the room into two sections, la (west) and lb (east), subdivided by a north-south parti- tion wall made of mud brick.2 Room la was a small, square room entered through a doorway on the east. A small window in its west wall opened into Room 7, and there was perhaps another in the north wall to provide light. It was originally deco- rated on three walls with a frieze of large, identical, stylized plants sprout- ing from an undulating yellow groundline. Each plant is shown with blos- soming triple stalks flanked at the base by two groups of triple leaves. They cover approximately one-half of the vertical wall space, giving them a monumental character that dominates the limited scale of the room. These plants have been identified as either sea lilies (Pancratium maritimum) 1. This study originated in a discussion with Sara Immerwahr while viewing the paintings at the National Archaeological Museum in 1979, and my initial interpretation of the Room of the Ladies fresco as a robing scene was subsequently pre- sented at the 1980 meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America (Peterson 1981a). It thus seems appro- priate to take a renewed look at this topic in her honor. For the contribu- tions that Dr. Immerwahr has made to the field of Bronze Age painting, and the crucial support she provided to my own research, I have long been grateful. My sincere appreciation is extended to Anne Chapin for her enthusiasm, diligence, and patience in the production of this volume, which honors a scholar and teacher whose insights and guidance have enlightened so many. I also wish to thank Christos Doumas for his helpful discussion of the site and permission to publish the photographs of Akrotiri frescoes con- tained herein, taken from The Wall- Paintings of Thera. Finally, this study would not have been possible without the support and assistance of Alex and Bill Murray, for whom I am ever thankful. 2.

Michae- lidou (2001, pp. 177-197), in a detailed study of the upper floors of this build- ing, distinguishes three floor levels in this sector, assigning the painted rooms to the uppermost story. A stone partition wall is in evidence for Room 1 on the first two stories only, but Michaelidou has detected evidence for a comparable wall of mud brick on the third story. The length and width of this mud-brick wall is uncertain.</page><page sequence="2">SUZANNE PETERSON MURRAY Figure 6.1. Plan of the House of the Ladies, Akrotiri. S. P. Murray, after Doumas 1992, fig. 1 or papyrus.3 As I consider them the former, I will refer to this area as the Sea Lilies Room. Room lb, a bit smaller than Room la, was decorated with a series of female figures in Minoan dress, hence its designation "Room of the La- dies." Here, the ruinous condition of the building has caused difficulties in determining the architectural arrangement of the space, the original loca- tions of the preserved fresco fragments, and the iconographic program of the decoration. The surviving fragments of paintings in this sector indi- cate a composition that included at least three female figures, about two- thirds to three-quarters life-size. Lady 1 (Fig. 6.2) decorated the south wall. Ladies 2 and 3 (Fig. 6.3), found in scattered fragments, have been paired in a second scene, but the original location of this scene within the room has been disputed. The most recent and convincing analysis of the evidence places this composition on the mud-brick partition wall at the west end of the room.4 Little of the walls in this uppermost level of the 3. For an identification as papyrus, see Warren 1976, p. 91; as sea lilies, see Thera V, pp. 38-39; Doumas 1992, pp. 34-35 (where a magnification of scale is noted). Porter (2000), who convincingly identifies these plants as sea lilies, notes their current sea- side growth in the Aegean Islands, and ascribes their significance as cult flowers to their pungent scent. Michaelidou (2001, p. 191) and Televantou (1992, p. 156) place fresco fragments representing imitation marbling on the fourth wall (the west face of the mud-brick partition wall). Michaelidou proposes that this side of the wall may have been designed, at least at its southern end, as cupboards or niches. 4. Michaelidou 2001, pp. 189-192, who notes, in her analysis of the day- books of the excavation, the discovery of a fragment of this painting still at- tached to a mud-brick backing, with imitation marbling painted on the other side. Televantou (1992, p. 156) also assigns this scene to the west parti- tion wall. Doumas (1983, p. 82) origi- nally placed it on an additional par- tition wall, running east-west and I02</page><page sequence="3">RECONSIDERING THE ROOM OF THE LADIES .-.~,-. ''.. '.

Doumas 1992, fig. 7 building have been preserved, and details of the architectural features of the room, such as windows and doorways, are largely unknown. The en- trance into this suite has not been definitively identified, but must have been in the ruined eastern section of the room, either in the south or east walls (or both).5 A window was probably placed in the north wall to pro- vide a light source, but the archaeological evidence is insufficient to iden- tify one. Therefore the precise length of wall space available for fresco compositions on the north, south, east, and west walls is unknown, further complicating issues of reconstruction. forming a corridor that subdivided Room lb (screening a bathroom). Marinatos (1984b) places the scene on the north wall (fig. 69) and Doumas's partition wall (fig. 65). Renewed excavations in the area in 1987 and 1990 have revealed more information, and Michaelidou has now assigned the east-west partition wall (and bath- room) to the second story and the frescoes to the paved room on the third story (pp. 188-190, 247). At present, the only mud-brick wall identified in the Room of the Ladies is the west partition wall (shown on the plan in Fig. 6.1), and Doumas now supports the positioning of Ladies 2 and 3 on this wall (pers. comm.). The degree of destruction in this sector of the building, however, and the com- pression of the upper floors and door- ways, presents a very complex stratigra- phy prone to reinterpretation. 5. Doumas 1992, pp. 34-35. See also Thera V, pp. 11-13, figs. 2, 3 (the plans conflict). The current placement of the doorway in the south wall, which gives access from the corridor, is based on the position of the doorway on the first and second floors. On the second story, Michaelidou (2001, p. 247) iden- tifies another doorway in the eastern wall, leading into Room 2, and suggests that the doorway in the third-story Room of the Ladies could have dupli- cated either, or both, of these locations. 1o3 - .. . .: . "Oo</page><page sequence="4">SUZANNE PETERSON MURRAY This discussion will focus primarily on the scene of Ladies 2 and 3 (tentatively placed on the west wall), and particularly on the problematic remains of the third figure. First, however, we must consider the decora- tion of the entire room. In both scenes, the figures are depicted against a white background, typical of Theran painting, above a wide black groundline. Above the heads of the ladies, the white background changes to a reticulated design of four-pointed stars (blue edged in black) con- nected by a network pattern of red dots. This zone of netted stars is bounded below by a thick, undulating band (blue between black) and above by a border of straight horizontal bands of varying widths (black, white, red, and yellow). It is most likely that a significant portion of the original deco- rative program also would have appeared on the north and east walls, pro- viding a link between the two scenes that have survived. LADY 1 (SOUTH WALL) In the scene on the south wall (Fig. 6.2), a single lady (Lady 1) is shown striding east, away from the direction of the adjoining Sea Lilies Room. She is dressed in Minoan festal attire: a short, flounced overskirt, open at the front and secured around the hips with a looped cord, worn over an ankle-length yellow dress that is tight and short-sleeved at the top and flaring at the bottom. In keeping with the iconography of Minoan cos- tumes, the dress is shown with decorative bands in contrasting colors along the length of the sleeve and shoulder (masking the seam?), around the bottom edge of the sleeve, down the front of the bodice and bell-shaped skirt, and at the hem.6 Horizontal stitching marks the lower part of the dress. Black hair undulates down her back, and her cheek and parted lips are tinted red. She wears little jewelry: a gold hoop earring and a simple necklace of two black strands. Shown in a composite profile view typical of Minoan art, with frontal skirt and somewhat distorted shoulder, Lady 1 is restored with arms ex- tended forward at different levels. This pose indicates some kind of activ- ity, but what she is doing remains a mystery. Fragments of the left upper arm show that it was raised to chest level, but, beyond that, its position is unknown. The right arm was apparently positioned at a lower angle, as fragments of the fingers, curled into a fist, appear in front of her bent leg. The arm placement suggests the pose of offering-bearers, although here they are more extended than usual.7 But the gesture of the right hand makes it difficult to see this as a carrying pose.

Whatever object she may have held originally, it did not extend below the level of her fist and prob- ably terminated within it. This seems to eliminate from consideration the types of objects that are commonly shown carried in a lowered position in Aegean art: vessels, necklaces, cloth or clothing, and flowers.8 The gesture of her right hand seems more like one of pulling than supporting. Perhaps she held something stretched between her two hands or extending into the field in front of her. Such a pose would fit most suitably with a narrow, flexible object (cloth or cord?) that could be pulled taut within the span of her fist. In front of Lady 1, in the lower portion of the fresco, a lengthy section of plaster is preserved, but it appears to be blank.9 This is the area toward which the figure moves and extends her arms, so it is difficult to com- prehend why such a disproportionately large amount of the composi- tional space here is devoid of representation. In spite of the seemingly ample space in front of her, the striding lady has been tightly fitted into the right end of the scene, so this white space must have been necessary to the composition. We must assume that the focus of her activity appeared either beyond the extant blank area (if there was space) or above it. If the former, the gap would emphasize the process of traversing (perhaps in a processional context). If the latter, the focal point must have been something carried by or suspended in front of Lady 1,10 something that visibly received no ground-line support and that was restricted in height by the netted-star zone. Doumas has suggested that her goal appeared on the destroyed east wall,"1 but it is then hard to understand why she would be placed so far back in the scene. A more satisfactory proposal, although purely con- jectural, would place another figure on the south wall, walking in front of the lady or facing her, perhaps with something stretched or carried be- tween them. An entrance in this wall, however, would curtail the needed space. Behind the striding lady, the wall surface shifts abruptly and jarringly to a wide strip of uniform yellow that extends from floor to ceiling, trun- cating the upper border bands and even the dado. This undecorated strip corresponds in placement and width to the doorway leading from the Room 8. For vessels, see, e.g., the Thebes procession (preceding note); for a neck- lace, the Adorants Fresco (Fig. 6.8; also known as the Lustral Basin Fresco); for flowers, the Great Goddess ring from Mycenae (Fig. 6.9:a) or the pro- cession of women from Pylos (Lang 1969, pl. 0). Cloth or clothing, whether carried low, as in the Pylos procession, or high, as by the eldest boy in the Xeste 3 scene (Doumas 1992, fig. 109) and in the Phylakopi fresco (preceding note), normally hangs below the hand. 9. Shadowy marks on the plaster appear to be later discolorations, but look tantalizingly like the hindquar- ters of a large feline. The addition of a lion or griffin here, with a tether held by the striding lady, would cor- respond to the association of such animals with religious ceremony (as in Fig. 6.7) and would be appropriate to the position of her hand. Technical analysis would be useful to determine if these markings are the residue left from flaking following the use of a fresco secco technique, or if they represent post-destruction additions. 10. Examples of suspended symbols and small, hovering figures appear on Minoan and Mycenaean seals and rings (see Fig. 6.9:a), but in scenes crowded with activity. The symbols are generally interpreted as religious imagery and the figures as epiphanies (Nilsson 1950, pp. 342-348; Hagg 1986, pp. 56-58; Niemeier 1990). There is too little information to suggest something of this nature here, but the iconography does exist. 11. Doumas 1983, p. 82. Io5</page><page sequence="6">SUZANNE PETERSON MURRAY of the Ladies into the Sea Lilies Room (Fig. 6.1).12 The wide, mono- chrome band marks a clear separation in the iconographical programs and spatial arrangements of the wall paintings in Rooms la and lb. The im- pression of continuity could have been conveyed easily by maintaining the white background and dadoes of the two rooms, a common technique, but the artist has deliberately severed any link between the two decorative pro- grams.'3 The striding lady of the south wall was not meant to be seen as emerging from Room la, nor is she directly associated with its decoration. Her activity is directed toward whatever completed the scene in the east- ern part of Room lb, either on the south or the east wall. LADY 2 AND LADY 3 (WEST WALL?) The decoration tentatively ascribed to the west (partition) wall (Fig. 6.3), although it is also in a very fragmentary state, was clearly intended to form an iconographic unit with the scene on the south wall. The border bands and netted-star zone are the same, and the representation focuses again on ladies in Minoan dress. Here too it is the section closest to the doorway of the Sea Lilies Room that has been more extensively preserved, and again the orientation of the figures is directed away from that doorway. In the fragments of this scene, two female figures may be discerned. The lady on the left (Lady 2) is almost completely preserved, significant gaps occurring only in the absence of her lower arms (including her right hand), her facial profile, and a segment of her back. Her appearance is much like that of the striding lady: tinted cheek, gold hoop earring, and thick, fillet-crowned hair falling across her back (its termination is not preserved). She also wears festal attire: a white dress, similarly edged with blue and black bands and marked below with horizontal stitching, and a white, flounced overskirt with triple tiers divided by colored bands (red, blue, and black). This costume has a somewhat plainer appearance than that of the striding lady: there are no bands along the hem of her dress and no striations (pleats?)14 in the skirt flounces. Lady 2 bends over sharply, a pendulous breast emerging from her bod- ice. Her left leg is extended forward and bent as if she is taking a step or counterbalancing the shift of her upper body. Her arms are also thrown forward, her left upper arm raised to a nearly horizontal position and the right at a lower diagonal. To represent this position, the artist has distorted the right shoulder in a manner typical of Minoan art, "folding" the shoul- der across the body in a pose resembling a three-quarter view.'5 Her head is tilted upward, a striking and unnatural position considering her bending posture. The result is a very complex pose whose sinuous line is echoed behind her in the undulating bands edging the netted-star zone. Immediately in front of Lady 2, just below her extended arms, a large section of another flounced overskirt is preserved. It is of nearly identical design (the colored bands are more plentiful). As these skirts are normally depicted in a frontal view, we can discern that what we see here is the right front flap, its upper portion (above the hipline) now missing. A sufficient 12. Doumas 1983, p. 82. 13. It is more characteristic of Theran painting to maintain the unity of decoration, especially the uni- formly white background, regardless of structural boundaries (Laffineur 1990, pp. 248-249; Davis 1990). The yellow strip may represent an attempt to mirror the architectural features (wooden beams?) of the opposite side of the doorway. A similar arrangement is used (with more natural coloring) on two of the panels of the male procession from Xeste 3 (see note 7), where it could be a device for setting a scene in an interior space. 14. Immerwahr (1990, p. 58) notes the pleating. 15. The "folded shoulder," a long- standing convention of Egyptian paint- ing, was used extensively in Aegean art, where it simplified the conventions for representing the bands that decorated the bodice decolletage and shoulder/ sleeve seam.

It is positioned at a lower level than the flounced skirts of the other ladies, dipping to brush the floor at the front, and there are no indications of a dress or feet beneath it. At the front, where flounced skirts normally part and reveal the garment worn underneath, we see only the white plaster of the background, with the unfastened tie-cord dangling loosely to the ground. The right arm of the bending lady reaches downward, indicating a posi- tion that would have brought her hand into contact with the top of the skirt, and she has been convincingly reconstructed as carrying it.16 Representa- blue tions of similar activities are well known in Aegean glyptic art, but before 1:.-' yellow discussing them let us first consider the remaining elements of this scene. An assemblage of fragments, found near the others of the north wall y 3, north but showing no direct joins with them, reveals a third female figure deco- ,House of rating the Room of the Ladies (Fig. 6.3, right). The white hand that touches her lightly is clearly that of the bending lady, linking the two figures in the composition. Limited preservation makes the reconstruction of this figure very problematic. Nonetheless, Lady 3 appears to be the focal point of the scene and her identity is central to the iconographical program of this room. The difficulties in reading the preserved details of this lady's cos- tume and pose have led to misconceptions in interpretation and recon- struction among scholars.17 A detailed examination of this section of the fresco (Fig. 6.4) is therefore necessary in order to detail these problems and suggest plausible alternatives. Lady 3 is clothed in a yellow dress decorated, like the white dress of her companion, with blue and black border bands. Overlapping the yellow dress is her right arm, preserved from forearm to upper arm, held in a straightened position with the elbow locked. The bottom of her yellow *rinatos sleeve, with a blue border band, confirms the identification of her arm, with a broad section of her torso preserved beneath it. The front border 40; of her dress (bodice), preserved at waist level, is indicated by the blue band -104; to the right of her forearm. Beyond this band, only a small portion of the fresco has survived, showing a narrow strip of white and, beyond that, a early that, bit of yellow at the right edge of the fragment. To the left of the arm of Ldies, the n under the Lady 3, we can see the uninterrupted expanse of her yellow garment, pre- le dress or served to below the hip line, revealing a full-length dress with no flounced :e and skirt overskirt.18 In further references to this dress, I shall use the terms "bodice" signs no and "skirt" to distinguish between parts of a single garment. Ocations or Since Lady 3 does not wear a flounced overskirt, the assumption fol- ng for the lows that the nearby lady who carries one is bringing it to her. This has led Iapouna- to the interpretation that this is a robing scene, in which a priestess is ierwahr being attired in festal garments for a religious ceremony.19 While Nanno Marinatos and I have agreed in the past about the general interpretation of this scene, we have differed in our views about the pose and appearance gs. 69, 71. of Lady 3. In her well-known reconstruction (Fig. 6.5),20 Marinatos re- preliminary stored the "priestess" (Lady 3) as a seated figure, with a frontal torso and expanse of the head and legs in profile to the left. This reconstruction attempts to create a pose in which the head of the "priestess" faces the bending lady I07</page><page sequence="8">SUZANNE PETERSON MURRAY Figure 6.5. Reconstruction by Nanno Marinatos of Ladies 2 and 3. S. P. Murray, after Marinatos 1984b, fig. 71 who approaches and touches her. There are, however, a number of details preserved on this figure that, when put into the context of Minoan ico- nography, indicate that this reconstruction is untenable and that a figure predominantly in right profile is indicated. The most telling clue about the pose of Lady 3 appears on the small portion of the sleeve preserved on her arm. Along its bottom edge, we see the contrasting hem band (in blue) that is typical of the design of this costume, but along the left side of the sleeve we see only the plain yellow fabric of the dress. When Minoan festal attire is depicted in Aegean paint- ing, the tight sleeve of the bodice is consistently represented with a con- trasting band that runs along the top of the shoulder and down the length of the sleeve to the hem band, marking the "front" of the sleeve.21 On frontal figures, this sleeve band edges the outer contour of the arm as a continuation of the line of the shoulder (as in Fig. 6.6, left). If Lady 3 was depicted in a frontal pose, as reconstructed by Marinatos, a blue band should have edged the left side of her sleeve, but clearly none is shown.22 The absence of a contrasting band here is consistent with the conven- tion for representing the sleeve of a woman in a profile position facing right. In this position, the band would have run along the missing right side of her sleeve (the front of her arm), as it does on the bending lady. At Akrotiri, these conventions are consistently applied to all female figures wearing the tight-fitting bodice of the festal costume (see particularly Fig. 6.7, left, where the same color scheme is used).23 At the right edge of this cluster of fragments is another blue band, this one marking the border that runs down the front of the dress bodice. The placement of this border also conforms to the convention for depict- ing profile views of women in Minoan dress (as on the bending lady of Fig. 6.3 and the veiled girl of Fig. 6.8, right). These views sometimes in- clude a portion of what seems to be the stomach (Fig. 6.6, right), which may account for the narrow strip of white that abuts the right side of this bodice band. This arrangement can also occur on female figures shown in 21. See note 6. In miniature scenes, the scale prohibits such details. 22. This convention is particularly strong in seated figures of the type Marinatos has proposed. Her recon- struction mistakenly inserts a blue band along the left edge of the sleeve, an error that relies on the expected convention instead of the preserved details of the fragment. 23. Figures 6.6 and 6.8 show the same convention on left-facing fig- ures. A slight variation in this conven- tion occurs in representations of the uniquely Theran transparent dress, with its longer, billowing sleeves (Fig. 6.8, left). On this looser garment, the sleeve bands wander more freely, but are still closely associated with the outer con- tour of the arm. The matronly women in procession outside the Room of the Saffron Gatherers (Doumas 1992, figs. 131, 133) show no bodice bands, but they do not wear the traditional festal costume.

That is not the case here. A sufficient amount of the fresco is pre- served to show that, beyond the strip of white stomach(?), a second blue bodice band was not depicted. Instead, the painting returns to a yellow pigment. The absence of a second blue band here makes a frontal pose very unlikely.24 Thus, Minoan and, more specifically, Theran, iconography indicates that Lady 3 should be regarded as a figure in profile (or in semiprofile, as discussed below). Her torso is oriented to the right, and the left contour of her yellow dress traces the line of her back. Her back does not display the pronounced curve that is shown on Ladies 1 and 2 (and other profile fig- ures at Akrotiri), nor does she have the typical wasplike waist. There are two possible reasons for this. Since a flounced overskirt is not cinched around her hips, the artist has indicated that the full-length dress fits more loosely without it, de-emphasizing the waist. And the curve of the upper back, exaggerated on the other figures by the convention for representing the "folded" shoulder of a raised arm, has been moderated by the lowered position of Lady 3's arm. Here, the shoulder appears (to the extent it can be discerned) to have been held back near the shoulder blade, departing from the conventional representation (cf. Fig. 6.7, left). It is also unlikely that Lady 3 was a seated figure. Images of seated women are abundant in Minoan art and the convention for representing them is very consistent: bent legs in profile, torso twisted into a frontal position, shoulders to each side (Fig. 6.9).25 A frontal torso is improbable here, as argued above, and the representation of a seated figure entirely in Figure 6.8. Adorants Fresco, north wall of Lustral Basin, Xeste 3. Doumas 1992, fig. 100 24. The reconstruction proposed by Marinatos (see note 20) omits the strip of white, rendering all of the area be- yond the blue bodice band as yellow, and reconstructing a frontal yellow dress with a single blue band running down its center. Niemeier (1986, fig. 8) also omits this detail. The question of whether this small area of yellow pigment represents more of the dress follows. 25. For numerous views of the seated female type, see the Grand- stand Fresco from Knossos (PM III, pl. xvii). The seated goddess of Xeste 3 (Fig. 6.7), whose torso turns in a more unique three-quarter view, shows the conventions of the seated pose when the arm crosses in front of the body. The shoulder remains in a frontal view and the sleeve border follows the outermost contour. These characteris- tics do not conform to the rendering of Lady 3.

Murray, after Peterson 1981b, fig. 101, and PMII, fig. 498, respectively profile is highly unlikely in this time period.26 In addition, the left contour of the dress of Lady 3 and the position of her arm are inconsistent with the characteristics of a seated figure. If Lady 3 was seated in a pose facing Lady 2, as in Marinatos's recon- struction, we would expect to see her dress curve up sharply at the left to indicate her raised legs (her torso would also be frontal and her bodice differently aligned).27 Such a view would place her arm in an impossibly clumsy position, as if she was shrinking away from the touch of her com- panion. A seated position facing right would be more viable, but in this case the left outline of her dress should give some indication of the dis- tinctive and conventional bulge representing the buttocks and "outer" hip of seated women. At the level of her buttocks, where the fresco breaks off, there is no hint of a bulge; the gentle arc of the back continues in an unin- terrupted line (the visible direction of the brush strokes reinforce this im- pression). This is the posture of a standing figure. The context of the ac- tion is also a significant factor here: it makes better sense to wrap a flounced skirt around the hips of a standing figure than a seated one! The fragments that preserve Lady 3 are currently positioned in a man- ner that tilts her torso, giving her the appearance of a bending figure, but there is no compelling reason for this arrangement.28 Lady 3 need not bend over to don a wraparound flounced skirt, nor is there any extant indication that her arm must be vertical. In her current position, the line of 26. Paintings of seated women with profile torsos first appear in LH III at Pylos (from the Inner Propylon: see Lang 1969, pl. M:1-2H2). The seated goddess with genii on the gold ring from Tiryns (CMS I, 179) appears in profile, but the date is uncertain (and her pose was conditioned by her ges- ture). The confusion that resulted when artists had to deviate from this convention is apparent in the case of the seated woman of the Adorants Fresco (Fig. 6.8). To represent the gesture of stroking her wounded foot, the artist pulled her right shoulder and torso into profile, yet, incongruously, still tried to maintain the convention of a frontal position for her other shoulder. The result is a pronounced distortion further emphasized by her overlong arms and the disarray of her unusual skirt (not the traditional flounced variety). The unique action and costume of this figure are marked departures from Minoan iconography for the seated female, extremes that are not indicated for Lady 3. 27. The pronounced shift in leg position is a pervasive element of this iconography, but a deviation may occur in the painting of a goddess(?) in festal costume from Ayia Triada (Immerwahr 1990, pl. 18) whose bending torso and slightly bent knees have caused consid- erable confusion in interpretation (sit- ting, standing, rising, or dancing?). The banded, V-shaped opening of her front- al bodice, preserved at the waist, is a clear contrast to the arrangement on Lady 3 in terms of both its alignment and girth. The wide, yellow section of the dress to the left of Lady 3's arm is too broad to be merely one half of a frontal bodice. In her reconstruction (Fig. 6.5), Marinatos attempts to com- pensate for the moderate curve of Lady 3's dress by ballooning the loose dress in front of her (incongruous on a seated figure) and by raising her on an inor- dinately high folding stool to decrease the degree of bend in her legs. 28. Both excavators (Thera V, p. 40; Doumas 1992, p. 35) have noted that the current arrangement is uncertain. Apparently the restorers sought to echo the bending position of the companion figure. III</page><page sequence="12">SUZANNE PETERSON MURRAY Figure 6.10. Tentative reconstruc- tion of the Presentation of the Sacral Skirt, Room of the Ladies, House of the Ladies. S. P. Murray the bell-shaped bottom of her yellow dress would surely overlap the flounced skirt carried behind her, and should appear in the small preserved area in front of the fringed edge of this skirt. Clearly it does not. A more satisfactory pose for this figure is achieved by turning the entire cluster of fragments so that Lady 3 is upright, as restored in Figure 6.10. Overall, this seems like a more natural and workable position. This revision alters the height of Lady 3 in the composition and, significantly, brings the presumed level of her head into alignment with the trajectory of her companion's upturned face.29 The shallow curve of her back and buttocks, so pronounced on her bending companion, is moderated by her vertical posture as well as her looser garment.30 By straightening her pose, the lower section of her dress would follow a line that does not intersect with the preserved portion of the carried skirt. The front band of her bod- ice also would appear in a vertical line more suited to the iconography of Minoan costume. In this pose, the placement of the arm would have helped to mask the difficult transition between profile and frontal views of the dress. The com- posite profile so often used by Aegean artists presented particular prob- lems with the depiction of the festal costume. The representation of the vertical bands that, in reality, marked the front of the dress, had to shift markedly from one position (outer contour) on the profile bodice to an- other (center axis) on the frontal skirt of the dress. This discrepancy was normally masked by the addition of the flounced overskirt, which could be manipulated to provide a more transitional view, as seen on Lady 2 (Lady 1, Fig. 6.2, shows the more jarring effect of a strictly frontal flounced skirt). This conventional solution was not available to the artist of Lady 3, but he has placed her arm in a key position to resolve the dilemma that must have been presented to him (a technique often used in later repre- sentations of this garment). 29. In the current restoration (Fig. 6.3), the impression is given that the undulating band above the figures dips downward as it approaches Lady 3, but this is an arbitrary recon- struction not based on extant evidence. In the proposed repositioning of Lady 3 shown in Figure 6.10, the hand of the bending lady is raised higher, but this does not significantly affect the composition. 30. The striding lady of the south wall (Lady 1), who also stands upright, displays an extreme curve in her back, but this has been accentuated by the tight fit of the flounced overskirt and the conventional hunching of the upper back when depicting a raised arm and "folded shoulder." II2</page><page sequence="13">RECONSIDERING THE RTHE ROOM OF THE LADIES PROBLEMS OF INTERPRETATION Let us, then, consider Lady 3 as an upright figure, facing right, most likely in a standing position. She wears only a Minoan dress and is approached from behind by a woman who carries the flounced skirt that will complete her festal costume. How much further can the restoration and interpreta- tion of this figure, and this scene, be extended? This fresco has for some time been accepted as a scene of robing the priestess; but, after a careful restudy of the fragments of this scene in rela- tion to Minoan, Cycladic, and specificallyTheran iconography, I have come to the conclusion that this earlier identification is too restricted.31 While it does contain the elements necessary for such an activity (albeit not as re- constructed by Marinatos), there are numerous curious features in this painting that cloud such a precise interpretation. I offer the following ob- servations in the hope of generating a renewed discussion of the nature of this scene. In general terms, this painting falls into a genre of Minoan religious imagery that has been defined by Peter Warren as robe ritual.32 Included in this category are numerous examples of Minoan art, some of which are shown in Figure 6.11, in which male or female figures are shown carrying garments, some clearly flounced skirts.33 The appearance of the double axe in a number of these examples verifies the religious nature of the activity, although the sacral associations of the skirt itself are well attested.34 In Fig. 6.11:a-c, the skirts are being carried to an unseen goal, either to be worn or offered in a ceremonial context. They are held at shoulder level, whether carried by hand or on a pole. Only the sealing in Fig. 6.11:e ap- pears to show a robing scene, and here the garment is put on over the head of a figure identifiable only by its protruding legs.35 These miniature scenes provide examples of the mode for represent- ing carried skirts or garments, but I do not feel that they adequately pro- vide us with a model for reconstructing this element of the painting. Two views seem plausible. When flounced skirts are worn by a figure, the con- vention for representing them with both front flaps visible is very strong, and both the proximity and similarity of this skirt to that on the bending lady make a comparable view possible here (a view related to the frontal skirt of Fig. 6.11:c). But such a reconstruction would cause the missing flap of the skirt to overlap the yellow dress in an unconventional manner.36 In most of the glyptic examples (Fig. 6.11:a, b, d), the skirt (or garment) is 31. Similar reservations have also been expressed by Warren (1988, p. 22). 32. Warren 1988, pp. 20-23. 33. The major study on this topic is Demargne 1948. See also Nilsson 1950, p. 251; Niemeier 1986, pp. 78- 81; Warren 1988, p. 20; Marinatos 1993, pp. 143-145. 34. See note 6. 35. See Levi 1925-1926, p. 142, fig. 157, where the garment is mistak- enly identified as a cuirass. In this case, what may be depicted is a type of cloak sometimes shown on Minoan men (as perhaps in Fig. 6.11:f and on the Har- vester vase from Ayia Triada [Higgins 1981, fig. 191]) rather than a skirt. A seal from Khania, showing two small attendants tending a seated female, is sometimes identified as a robing scene (as in Warren 1988, p. 21, fig. 12), but no garments are visibly involved and the attendants appear to be seated. 36. Such overlapping would be quite unusual in scenes of human figures at this time, but it is certainly indicated by the many pairs of overlapping feet and robes in the Knossos Procession Fresco (PM II, fig. 450, pl. XXV); at Akrotiri it was a common composi- tional technique in representations of animals, such as the dolphins and deer of the Miniature Fresco in the West House, and the antelopes of Building Beta (Doumas 1992, figs. 35, 83).

S. P. Murray, after Demargne 1948, figs. 4, e f 3, 5, 1, 7, 6, respectively carried as a bundle, shown roughly in profile but without any indication of the front edge, a detail that is so distinctive in the fresco. Given the close parallel in form between Figure 6.11:b and the painted skirt, a profile view is a strong possibility. It would fit well into the compositional space be- tween the ladies and be compatible with the unpainted space in front of the extant skirt flap. A flounced skirt that showed one flap of the front opening, and not the other, however, would be a severe departure from Aegean conventions for this motif, perhaps too severe in this context. In the absence of further information, I do not think the reconstruction of the carried skirt can be resolved at this time. Although all of these glyptic representations illustrate activities re- lated to the scene in the Room of the Ladies, none shows the garment carried at such a low level. It certainly seems impractical to put this flounced skirt on over the head, as in Figure 6.11:e, but it is equally unnecessary to lower it so much that it brushes the floor. This kilt-like skirt, open at the front, would best be donned over a dress by holding it at waist level, so that it could be wrapped around the hips and secured with the tie-cord. This procedure should require two hands, but Lady 2 carries the skirt with only one, her other hand reaching up to touch Lady 3. The low position in which she holds out this flounced skirt, as well as her deeply bending pose, are poorly suited to the implied action of dressing Lady 3, and we must consider whether there are other feasible explanations. II4</page><page sequence="15">RECONSIDERING THE THE ROOM OF THE LADIES A compelling alternative is to view the bending lady as setting the skirt down. In this case, the action takes on the nature of presenting an offering, placing the skirt at the feet of Lady 3 while reverently touching her back and gazing up at her. The evidence for the presentation of gar- ments and fabric as offerings is considerable.37 This interpretation, how- ever, presents its own difficulties, and makes the identification of Lady 3 increasingly complex. If this is a scene of offering rather than robing, why is the sacral costume of Lady 3 incomplete, and why is the offering being presented behind her?38 One of the more troubling compositional features of this painting, if Lady 3 is restored facing right, is the approach of the skirt-bearing Lady 2 from behind her. This arrangement is more suitable to figures engaged in group activities oriented toward a single goal, such as processions (see Figs. 6.9:a, 6.11:a), rather than a scene representing the direct interaction of two figures. In a robing context, a flounced overskirt such as that shown in the fresco would best be put on from the back, but the resulting compo- sition seems clumsy and unfocused. We have no clear parallels in other contexts to guide us here. Despite the activity behind her, Lady 3's pose seems to indicate that her attention is focused in the other direction, and we must wonder whether this scene might have originally included another figure facing her. With the lack of secure data, it is impossible to do more than speculate on where such a figure might have been depicted. A facing figure on the same wall would provide the scene with greater balance and a more effective focal point. This compositional technique, a central figure framed by two facing figures, is used in other paintings at Akrotiri, such as the "Mistress of Animals" with Saffron Gatherers (Fig. 6.7, which omits one of the girls) and the Adorants Fresco (Fig. 6.8) from Xeste 3, both of which represent themes of offering. If this scene is to be placed on the west partition wall, however, it is very unlikely that a third figure could have been accommodated there. Even though the exact length of the partition wall is uncertain, the door- way into Room la would limit the available wall space in this small room, leaving insufficient space for a third figure. We must turn instead to the north wall, where there is little physical evidence, but sufficient space for a figure to approach from the east. This is a very ruinous part of the site, with a distinct decrease in material remains, but a few fresco fragments of the netted-stars motif and "at least one female figure" have been associated with 37. The miniature faience dresses seal from Mallia (Fig. 6.11:d; see suggest an offering context here (part and girdles from the Temple Reposi- Demargne 1948 and Niemeier 1986, of a broader cycle of making and pre- tories at Knossos (PM I, fig. 364) indi- p. 80).

If a window pierced the north wall, the direction of illumination would also emphasize the scene on the west wall. Even with the probable insertion of a window, the north wall would have provided a surface sufficient for at least two figures (in procession?), although there is too little evidence at this time to determine this. Whether we view the painting of the west wall as a costuming scene or a presentation of offerings, it is tempting to imagine another figure, or figures, approaching Lady 3, perhaps carrying an item associated with festal dress (e.g., a necklace, as in Fig. 6.8) or ritual preparation (such as the double axe, associated with skirts in Fig. 6.11:a, b). We must also con- sider that, in a ritual of ceremonial robing that stressed the sacral nature of the flounced skirt, the role of the bending lady was merely to present the skirt, and another (facing?) figure was then responsible for dressing Lady 3 in it. Lady 3 is also notable for the absence of long, black hair falling down her back, a detail that is characteristic of the other women decorating this room and typical of most female figures in Minoan art. The paintings from Xeste 3 at Akrotiri provide three possible explanations. In the Adorants Fresco (Fig. 6.8), a veiled girl walks in profile toward the left, but her head is turned in the opposite direction, her locks of hair falling across her chest rather than her back. In Room 3b (adjoining the Room of the Saffron Gatherers), two women in procession wear their hair bound up in scarves.40 Finally, the Saffron Gatherers (Figs. 6.6, 6.7) have short curly hair or shaved heads, signs of their youth.41 While all of these examples provide alternatives to a flowing hairstyle, none can be definitively applied to Lady 3 in the context of this scene. Turn- ing her head in a direction opposite that of her torso would create a visual connection with the lady approaching her, just as the gaze of the veiled girl connects her with the shrine on the adjoining wall of the Lustral Basin of Xeste 3. Yet, even with her torso restored to an upright position, Lady 3 would have to tilt her head downward to meet the gaze of the bending lady, a contortion that seems extreme. Turning her head in a level gaze (as the veiled girl does) is a greater possibility, but then Lady 3 would be reacting to her companion only by looking past her, toward the doorway to Room la. An alternative reconstruction (Fig. 6.12) illustrates such a pose. If this was intended to be a single, isolated scene within the decorative program of the room, then a turned head would effectively turn the composition back in on itself, providing some degree of balance and avoiding the effect of having Lady 3 merely stare into an empty corner. If, however, the activity that was originally represented included a figure (or figures) approaching along the north wall, then such a pose would diminish the visual continuity between the two walls. The reconstruction in Figure 6.12 is feasible, but it seems the less likely of the two poses. The impression it gives is somewhat disjointed, given the proximity of the bending lady, and seems to run contrary to the sense of momentum that characterizes the extant figures.42 39. Televantou 1992, p. 156.

It is interesting to note that the youth from Xeste 3 (see note 37) turns and looks back over the head of his companion, but his pose (with frontal torso) is more suited to this action-his companion is shorter and merely follows him (not interacting)- and his gaze is directed back through the doorway through which he is passing. In6</page><page sequence="17">RECONSIDERING THE ROOM OF THE LADIES Figure 6.12. Alternative reconstruc- tion of Lady 3, with turned head, Room of the Ladies, House of the Ladies. S. P. Murray The Xeste 3 processional ladies with bound hair seem to represent a distinct and separate group, interpreted as matronly in age and status.43 Although this fragmentary painting has not yet been restored, the women are distinguished by heavier physiques, fleecy robes worn across one shoulder, and an absence of earrings. Their bound hairstyles may represent a convention for more advanced maturity. It is problematic at this point to associate this age group with the women of the Room of the Ladies, whose flowing hair and lithe figures display the attributes of young adults.44 The young, shorn girls of the Saffron Gatherers and Adorants fres- coes do mingle with women who, like our ladies, display the traditional flowing tresses of adult females, but can we see Lady 3 as a young girl among elder companions? As the focal point in an offering scene, cer- tainly not; in a robing scene, we would have to imagine some kind of in- vestiture ritual in which a young initiate is presented with her first festal flounced skirt. In the context of a rite of passage, the clear indication of maturity on the bending Lady 2 would present a striking contrast with the younger initiate. In such a context, however, we would expect the girl and her skirt to be of smaller size than an adult (as is the veiled girl in the Ado- rants Fresco). The surviving amount of the carried skirt is insufficient to indicate its size (the preserved height is a little less), but the proportions of 43. Marinatos 1984b, pp. 64-65; Davis 1986, pp. 403-404; Immerwahr 1990, p. 62. 44. Davis (1986, pp. 403-404) argues that the women of the Room of the Ladies are "aged," due in part to the large, drooping breast of the bending lady. Marinatos (1984b, p. 101) proposes that she is a lactating mother who is younger than the women with bound hair. In my view, the representation of prominent breasts is a device used to indicate, when in profile, the status of females as fertile young adults, a device that becomes a convention codified in Mycenaean processional scenes of women in Mi- noan dress, such as those at Tiryns and Thebes (Peterson 1981b, pp. 46-86). They are not a sign of advanced age but merely sexual maturity and fertil- ity; and, in combination with the flowing hairstyle, serve as indicators of younger adulthood (as also in Marinatos 1984b). The wounded lady of Xeste 3 (Fig. 6.8), who is in profile, also appears to have a large breast (the outline is visible above her thigh). In the case of the bending lady, the breast is emphasized by her pose, and the artist has given free reign to its poten- tial as a filling device (as well as his own predilection for exaggerated curves, apparent as well in her impos- sible wasplike waist). II7</page><page sequence="18">SUZANNE PETERSON MURRAY Figure 6.13. Lady with necklace, detail of Adorants Fresco, Xeste 3. S. P. Murray, after Doumas 1992, fig. 101 both ladies appear to be the same.45 Moreover, there is as yet no clear evidence for such a ceremony and, although images of young girls as par- ticipants in rituals (Figs. 6.6, 6.9:a) and attendants of priestesses or god- desses are familiar, they never appear, as Lady 3 does, as the focal point of an activity.46 We must bear in mind, however, that the discovery of the Thera frescoes brought to light many heretofore unknown themes and concepts, particularly regarding age differentiation and rites of passage, and, in the context of Theran and Minoan society, we should not rule out such a ceremony or the representation of it. Equally perplexing details appear at the front of Lady 3's torso, where the fragments preserve only a few enigmatic clues. These concern the strip of white (flesh?) and bit of yellow (dress?) in front of the bodice border band. The white area may represent her stomach (discussed above), as these are sometimes included in profile views of female figures in festal attire, indicating that the bodice of the dress did not always close immediately below the breasts. To the right of the line of the stomach, however, we would expect to see a return to the white background rather than a change to yellow ochre. This color matches that of her dress, but why does it ap- pear beyond the line of her stomach? On a frontal figure, the other side of her open yellow bodice would appear here, but edged first by another blue border band (as discussed above). This detail runs counter to the conven- tions for either frontal or profile figures. We have a single clear departure from this convention in the lady car- rying a necklace from Xeste 3 (Fig. 6.13). Her torso is depicted in the Theran version of a three-quarter view,47 and the sheer fabric of her bodice 45. Lady 3 is not larger, as pro- posed by Marinatos (1984b, p. 102). 46. Papageorgiou (2000, pp. 965- 966) interpreted the Xeste 3 youth with the striped cloth (note 37 above) as a young initiate about to be clothed in this garment by a nearby adult male, and alludes to a similar theme in the Room of the Ladies. For girls as atten- dants, see Nilsson 1950, p. 268. 47. This unusual pose, used often in the Xeste 3 paintings (see the god- dess, Fig. 6.7), depicts the more distant breast in profile and ignores the nearer breast, covering the blank expanse of chest with the curving line of the banded bodice. II8</page><page sequence="19">RECONSIDERING THE ROOM OF THE LADIES 48. The sheer dresses represented in Xeste 3 show longer, looser sleeves than that of Lady 3, and a light wash of color conveys the delicacy of the fabric, whereas the yellow ochre of Lady 3's dress has a more opaque quality. For the design of these sheer dresses, see Tele- vantou 1984, fig. 3. 49. Comparable, though higher, arm positions are shown by the priestess of the bull sacrifice on the Ayia Triada sarcophagus (Long 1974, fig. 86), the faience Snake Goddess with the conical headdress from Knos- sos (Fig. 6.16:a), and statue 6-1 from Kea (Fig. 6.16:b). In Aegean painting, it would be unusual to find an arm overlapped to this degree by the torso. 50. The extremes to which artists went to maintain this convention are illustrated by the man holding a large vase in the Xeste 3 paintings (Doumas 1992, fig. 114). A complete profile per- spective was attempted in one of the fishermen from the West House at Akrotiri (Doumas 1992, fig. 18), but here the shoulder is again folded inward in the standard manner of representing a carrying pose. 51. A complete profile view does appear to be used later in the Myce- naean period on the Tiryns ring (see note 26), but the miniature scale and sculptural medium make this an un- suitable comparison, especially as the "folded shoulder" convention continues to prevail in Mycenaean painting. reappears beyond the swell of her stomach. The bodice edge on this side is obscured by her torso, thus no band is visible. The sweep of fabric beyond her torso is meant to convey the loose fit and voluminous lines of this garment as it flows into the sleeves. Although the dress of Lady 3 does not appear to be of this sheer type, the artist may have used a similar technique here to indicate the looser fit of her dress before it is confined by the flounced overskirt.48 It is possible that the torso of Lady 3 was also depicted in three-quarter view, although the profile position of her right arm is in stark contrast to the frontal shoulders of other such figures, and the girth of the preserved bodice compares more closely to a figure in profile. In Figure 6.10, the torso has been reconstructed as a composite of profile and three-quarter views, based as much as possible on other Theran examples, and the left arm has been positioned arbitrarily in a way that allows the looseness of her dress to be represented (a raised position would empha- size it further). In a robing scene, Lady 3 might be participating in the process by dressing herself or reaching for another costuming item (or offering?) from a figure approaching her. Although the identification of the white strip as the stomach area seems the most probable, we must allow the possibility that it is the white of the background or even her other arm. This narrow strip, abbreviated though it is, shows a distinct upward taper that contrasts with the cus- tomary bulge or downward taper used for stomachs (as in Figs. 6.6, right, 6.13). The taper parallels the contour of her right arm, and we must won- der if Lady 3 was shown with both arms held down in front of her.49 Such a pose would render the yellow area in front of her even more puzzling, however, and seems unconvincing in this context. The position of the preserved arm of Lady 3 is another anomaly that impedes the restoration of this figure. Portrayal of the arm in such a straight, downward position, though uncommon, is not unique (see the veiled Ado- rant of Fig. 6.8 or the frontal Saffron Gatherer of Fig. 6.6), but position- ing it so close to her body is. Although the arm functions as a masking device (discussed above), it is difficult to imagine what Lady 3 could be doing, or holding, in this context that would require such an unusual pose, one that adds a considerable impression of stiffness to the figure. If this is indeed a costuming scene, her arm is inappropriately placed to aid in the donning of the flounced skirt; in fact she blocks Lady 2 from applying it. In the reconstruction in Figure 6.10, I1 have drawn Lady 3 smoothing her dress in preparation for the addition of the flounced skirt, but her original gesture remains a mystery. The shoulder is pulled back so close to the line of her back that we must consider whether this figure was shown in a true profile view, with- out the hunched distortion of the "folded shoulder" that prevails in Minoan iconography.50 Such a depiction would be so unusual in Minoan art, par- ticularly in wall painting, that we must wonder if this is a deliberate and significant distinction.51 In the iconography of the human figure in Egyp- tian art, whose conventions parallel those of the Aegean, such deviations occur in the representation of statues (Fig. 6.14). Is a similar distinction plausible here? II9</page><page sequence="20">SUZANNE PETERSON MURRAY The identification of representations of sculpture in Aegean painting has been tentative, at best, and no specific iconography for this subject has as yet been recognized. The best candidate for such a representation, and the one closest in subject to Lady 3, appears on a fresco fragment from Mycenae, showing a small female figure held by two large female hands, which I have previously interpreted as a figurine exchange in an offering scene.52 She is shown in profile, but with a "folded shoulder," and wears a long dress with no flounced skirt. Other plausible fresco representations of sculpture tend to be on an equally small scale.53 Certainly the archaeo- logical record has borne out the plentiful existence of figurines in Bronze Age society (although generally less realistic in appearance), and it would not be surprising to find them included in fresco scenes, but what of some- thing much larger? The possibility exists, though remote in our current state of knowl- edge, that Lady 3 represents a life-size statue, the focus of a scene of votive offering or ritual costuming-in other words, a cult statue. Evidence for the existence of cult statues in the Bronze Age, let alone the depiction of them, is sparse and highly debated.54 Some figurines, particularly those found in shrines, presumably served this purpose.55 On a bigger scale, the most compelling evidence is the pair of large terracotta feet from the cult building at Anemospilia on Crete, apparently dowelled for the attachment of a body.56 The ability to construct statues on this scale has been proven by the terracotta figures from Kea that, like Lady 3, are large, standing, female figures in similar attire (see below, Fig. 6.16:b).57These figures have also been placed in a religious context, but, due to their numbers, have been interpreted as votaries rather than representations of deities.58 Cult statues, if they existed, no doubt would have been focal points for the robe rituals discussed above. Not only would they have received offer- ings of cloth and clothing, they would have been robed in gift garments as well. Indeed, the skirts shown on the seals of Figure 6.11 may represent gifts for the goddess rather than ceremonial robes for the priestess. Such ceremonies may be reflected in the Linear B term te-o-po-ri-ja, found in texts at Knossos, which has been convincingly argued by Stefan Hiller as Figure 6.14.

For the original fragments, see Mylonas 1972, pp. 39-40, pl. 14. 53. Immerwahr (1990, p. 121) has proposed that the fresco fragment from Mycenae showing a figure in a boar's tusk helmet, carrying a griffin, repre- sents an ivory sculpture group. Boulotis (1979) interprets a fragment from the Tiryns procession fresco as the base of a wheel-made figurine, carried with a piece of cloth. The bovine animals carried as offerings on the Ayia Triada sarcophagus also appear to be statuettes (Long 1974, pp. 46-47, fig. 17). 54. For a summary of the evidence, see Marinatos and Higg (1983), who deny the existence of cult images on Crete and representations of statues in Minoan art. See Warren 1988, pp. 30- 34, and Rutkowski 1986, pp. 142-145, for more positive assessments. 55. For example, the Snake God- desses from Knossos (PM I, pp. 500- 506, fig. 377) and the Lady of Phyla- kopi (Renfrew 1985, pp. 215,372, pl. 31). 56.

These figures, found in the temple, range up to life-size and, in date, as early as LM I. They wear costumes with bell-shaped skirts and tight-fitting bodices edged with prominent borders (they differ from Lady 3 in the addition of heavy gir- dles). No flounced skirts are evident, but it is possible that real ones were added separately (as part of costum- ing rituals?). 58. Caskey (Keos II, i, p. 74) does not rule out the existence of cult statues in such a context, because, as she notes, some of the statues were "revered enough to be resurfaced and repaired" with plaster and paint.

Detail,Alison U 9 = 4 Frantz Collection, American School of Classical Studies at Athens reference to a festival that involved the carrying of a cult image in con- junction with references to cloth or garments.59 This may indicate a ritual merely of offering or a ceremony that included robing. In contemporary Egypt, the ritual dressing of cult statues was stan- dard religious practice, and in Greece, similar customs may be reflected in later traditions such as the presentation of a robe to a cult statue of Athena during the Greater Panathenaia.60 In my opinion, such a robed cult image is depicted in Aegean painting on the AyiaTriada sarcophagus (Fig. 6.15). Included here among the scenes of Minoan ritual is a curious, armless male figure that has been interpreted by Charlotte Long as the deceased in front of his tomb, but I believe it represents a large-scale cult statue.61 Shown completely in profile and shrouded in a robe offering that obscures its arms, the figure stands before a shrine and faces a procession of offer- ing-bearers. This painting is of a later date, and on a much smaller scale than that of the Room of the Ladies, but it does offer a possible parallel. Does Lady 3 represent a statue, about to be robed in a skirt offering? Such an interpretation has only slight support from other sources, but the concept is intriguing nonetheless. It could account for the general stiffness in her pose and the unusual position of her arm(s), similar to that of the statues in Figure 6.16. As the image of a deity, her hair need not be the same style as that of the other ladies.62he application of the yellow dress 59. Hiller 1984.

Murray, after PMI, frontispiece, and Keos II, i, pl. 38, respectively might also have obscured it (as the robe obscures the "armless" figure in Fig. 6.15). This identification might also explain why she is apparently oblivious to the offered skirt and the lady presenting it. If the bending lady is preparing to robe a statue, her position behind the image, with one hand steadying it or giving reverence, is conceivable; but the addition of another figure to balance the scene and participate in the robing process would still be desirable here. Some scholars have suggested that this scene shows the epiphany of the goddess,63 but it would be contrary to the iconography of such scenes to show Lady 3 in profile, and unusual to show a worshiper in physical contact with her (if Xeste 3 is an indication, Theran artists would also show a goddess on a larger scale). More plausible is the proposal by W.-D. Niemeier that this could be a priestess being prepared for a ritual of staged epiphany (an appearance in the guise of a goddess).64 If this is the case, it is difficult to understand the lack of interaction on her part, especially the obstructive position of her arm (raised arms would be more appropriate to such ritual dressing). Such a ceremony could have been quite formal, how- ever, with the priestess assuming a transcendent state as she is transformed into the surrogate of the goddess. Should she not then wear a costume that also sets her apart from her "earthly" attendant? In a scene presumed to emphasize sacral garments and ceremonial robing, the lack of elaboration in the costumes, especially that of Lady 3, is puzzling. These garments seem very plain compared to those represented in Xeste 3, and may reflect a hierarchy of costumes for different rituals (the celebration of nature in Xeste 3 reflected in the festive decoration of the garments) or a change in fashion (if the paintings differ in date). The absence of any significant differentiation in the garments of the two ladies of this scene de-emphasizes the prominence of Lady 3 as the focal point of the ritual represented (unless she is an initiate, as discussed above). If the epiphany of a goddess or a priestess-as-goddess was represented, we would expect her to be distinguished from her companions by more elaborate 63.

To explore these possibilities, Lady 3 must be approached as a figure in profile facing right (the torso perhaps in three-quarter view), standing erect, with one arm held down stiffly near her side. She turns her back to her pre- served companion and probably turned her head away as well. She appar- ently does not have long, loose hair. She wears a long yellow dress that appears to continue, in an unconventional manner, beyond the white area of her stomach (or left arm?). Behind her, the bending Lady 2 brings her a flounced overskirt as part of a robe ritual, either as an offering or as a sacred vestment to be worn in a ceremonial context. This has been interpreted as one stage in an exten- sive ritual involving the manufacture of the sacred garment, a procession of offering, the ritual presentation of the garment to a priestess or goddess (illustrated by this painting) and, at some stage in this process, the adora- tion of the garment itself as a symbol of the deity.66 Thus, the most appro- priate designation for this scene would be "The Presentation of the Sacral Skirt." CONTEXT 65. PM II, fig. 450. The absence of status distinction by means of costume is a common problem in deciphering images of women in festal dress, but differentiation appears more often in paintings than on seals and rings, where the miniature scale generally precludes such minute details. 66. Warren 1988, pp. 20-22. Mor- gan (1990, p. 261) and Marinatos (1986, pp.58-61; 1993, pp. 143-145) present similar ideas. 67. Marinatos 1984b, pp. 97-105. See also Thera V, p. 13; Thera VI, pp.8-11. 68. Doumas 1983, p. 82; 1992, pp. 34-35. Michaelidou (2001, pp. 177, 195) has verified the placement of the clay "chests" in the floor of the second story, below the level of the paving slabs of the Sea Lilies Room. A final note must be made regarding the context in which both scenes from the House of the Ladies appeared. The function of this extensive building remains in question, as does the exact design of Room 1 and its adjacent rooms on the uppermost story. In her analysis of the paintings, Marinatos asserts that the House of the Ladies was a shrine, tended by a primary priestess and several attendants. As supporting evidence, she cites the discovery of "sacral repositories" set into the floor of Room la and cultic material (rhyta, nippled ewers, triton shells) found within the re- positories and in a nearby storeroom, Room 7 (Fig. 6.1).67 The storage of ritual equipment in the floor of the Sea Lilies Room would lend credence to a role as a cult center, but this arrangement is no longer accepted. Doumas, reinvestigating the House of the Ladies in recent years, has assigned the repositories to the floor below, designated the artifactual material as do- mestic, and interpreted the structure as "a wealthy private residence."68 After examining the frescoes and their location, I find neither of these conflicting interpretations entirely convincing. The Presentation of the Sac- ral Skirt in the decorative program of Room lb does give this sector of the House of the Ladies a religious character, but the building seems unsuit- able as a center of cult activity. The Sea Lilies Room and the Room of the Ladies appear to have been the only rooms distinguished by an extensive fresco program, and yet these were located in a remote and rather inacces- sible part of the building, more appropriate to a private area than a public I23</page><page sequence="24">SUZANNE PETERSON MURRAY shrine. Set at the back of the house, Room 1 was distant from the main staircase (at the southwestern end of the building) and was accessed from the service stairs (in the center) only via a circuitous route through corri- dors that surrounded the light well. Whether Room 1 was entered from the southeast corner, or from the east (through the wall of Room 2), the difficulty of access was ill suited to the comings and goings of regular ritual activity. It is in marked contrast to the central location and ready accessibility of recognized cult spaces at Akrotiri, such as the polythyron of Xeste 3 or the room of the Springtime Fresco (Delta 2).69 We seem to have a room whose decoration gives it ceremonial connotations, beyond the nature of a personal shrine, but whose location, tucked away at the back of the building, on the top floor, gives it a remote, private character. How then do we reconcile the decorative program of Room 1 with its setting? Is this a private dressing area with ritual associations? Room lb, where the scene of robing was illustrated, was not well suited to such ac- tivity. Smaller and more narrow than Room la, it is generally regarded as an antechamber. If this room was used for ceremonial dressing, it would have been a very small, cramped, and private ritual, accommodating no more than two to three people. Thus, a ritualistic robing or a procession of offering seems unlikely here, but where might the activities illustrated take place? The fact that Rooms la and lb are the only two areas extensively dec- orated leads us to assume that the activity represented in the Room of the Ladies had some relationship with what took place in the Sea Lilies Room (Room la) or with the outdoor setting represented on its walls. Niemeier has proposed that Room la served as the dressing area for the priestess preparing for an enacted epiphany, and that its function was illustrated in the antechamber.70 But the ladies of the antechamber are not shown emerg- ing from Room la (as discussed above), nor are their actions directed to- ward it. Had the robing scene appeared on the south wall of Room lb, so that the figures faced the doorway, it could have functioned as a signpost to similar activities conducted within the next room,71 but on the west wall it had the opposite effect, directing attention away from it. Therefore, it is unlikely that the activity depicted in Room lb took place in Room la, which is in any case nearly as small as Room lb.72 Could a large-scale cult statue have stood in the Sea Lilies Room, representing the Minoan nature goddess and surrounded by representa- tions of cult flowers meant to invoke her presence and symbolize her out- door realm? While the idea is intriguing, the same problems make it diffi- cult to justify such a theory. The remote location of the room and the domestic character of the building argue against such a prominent role, which would presumably require greater accessibility for ongoing ritual activity. Given that the repositories discovered in this area have been reas- signed to the room below, Room la displays a distinct lack of material evidence for offerings or cult equipment.73 Thus, the only support for this theory resides in the variable interpretation of the paintings in Room lb. If a cult image resided in the Sea Lilies Room, it would be appropriate to decorate the antechamber to her shrine with associated ceremonies, but as 69. Doumas 1992, pp. 100, 126- 131. Michaelidou (2001, pp. 396-397) discusses a similar distinction between private and semiprivate space, assigning the third-story Rooms 1 and 2 to the private sector and Rooms 6 and 7, linked by a polythyron, to a semiprivate use. 70. Niemeier 1992, pp. 100-101. Some of the problems with this inter- pretation have been discussed earlier. 71. The Minoan technique of ar- ranging mural compositions to act as signposts that direct attention to fur- ther ritual activities has been elucidated by Cameron (1987). 72. Room la: ca. 2.10 x 2.20 m; Room lb: ca. 2.40 x 1.60 m (the south wall runs at an angle, causing a variance in the width of the room from 2.10 m at the west to 2.40 m at the east). These approximate dimensions are based on a comparison of the plans in the excava- tion report (Thera V, fig. 2) and in Michaelidou 2001, fig. 97, which display some discrepancies. The plans record dimensions that are primarily those of the second story. 73. Michaelidou (2001, p. 199) reports that no artifacts were recovered from this room, and assumes they were either removed in the evacuation of the town, stored in another room (such as Room 7), or that objects were not used in the room. I24</page><page sequence="25">RECONSIDERING THE THE ROOM OF THE LADIES 74. Immerwahr (1990, p. 55) also notes the outward orientation of the scene, "as if the women, when dressed, would proceed to another area." Niemeier (1992, p. 101) agrees, proposing that the priestess, once dressed, enacted her epiphany else- where. 75. A similar interpretation has been submitted by Immerwahr (1990, p. 49 and note 24). It is also possible, though less likely, that such textiles were hung on walls. 76. Barber 1991, pp. 339-345,347 (for the textile patterns, see pp. 317- 319, 329-330). 77.

Warren begins the ritual with the making of the garment and suggests that the scene on the seal in Figure 6.11:d shows its presentation. Morgan (1990, p. 261) begins it with the collection of saffron for dye (illus- trated in Xeste 3) and ends it with the presentation of the finished garment. these scenes do not guide us into the inner sanctum, we cannot read them as illustrations of what occurred within Room la. Even though it is pos- sible that the painting depicts a statue, this scene cannot attest the location of such a statue in the next room. So, it appears that the ritual depicted here, whether robing or offering, whether priestess, goddess-image, or even initiate, did not take place in the Sea Lilies Room or the Room of the Ladies. The orientation of the ladies away from the Sea Lilies Room gives the distinct impression that their activity occurs in a separate location and is subsequent to any activity associated with Room la.74 Where, then, does this activity occur? Details of the paintings in Room lb may indeed provide a clue to the setting of the ladies' actions. A network of stars and dotted lines is sus- pended above the figures on both walls, a detail that was quite unnecessary if the activities represented took place in the Sea Lilies Room. This pat- tern bears a distinct relationship to the woven designs on garments (as on the skirt in Fig. 6.13) and may represent textiles used to form a tent or enclosure (or canopy?),75 inside which the ladies perform the ritual of of- fering or of dressing for a ceremony. Convincing parallels have been noted for the use of Aegean textiles for canopies, pavilions, and boat cabins in Middle and New Kingdom Egypt.76 In Aegean painting, the Palanquin Fresco at Knossos may show fragments of a Minoan canopy with a wooden framework, and fresco fragments from Mycenae have been interpreted as textile-covered ikria (closely associated with the ikria of the West House).77 The Therans clearly had the ability to weave such textiles and use them in this manner. A setting that surrounded the participants with cloth would certainly have been fitting in a ritual that stressed sacred clothing. The artist could not cover the entire background of the scenes with these patterned tapes- tries without interfering drastically with the ladies, so he has raised the textiles above the level of the figures. The bottom edges of the textile pan- els are marked by heavy border bands-reminiscent of those used on the dresses-that shadow the contours of the figures as if to emphasize the sense of enclosure. Thus, like the depending rockwork in Figure 6.8 or the rivers in the Miniature Fresco of the West House,78 what is meant to be seen behind the figures is represented above them. If the scene of the ladies is set within a textile enclosure, how does it relate to the decoration of the Sea Lilies Room? The Sea Lilies Room may symbolize the outdoor setting near which the tent enclosure or screen or canopy is set up (perhaps near the shore?). Might the ladies, emerging from the enclosure, then proceed to a ceremony in this outdoor setting? Based on extant images and using the sequence of robe rituals set forth by Warren,79 we can imagine the following ceremony. The sacred garment is brought forth and carried in procession to another location (a tent, screen, or canopy?), presumably accompanied by other cult equip- ment, as in Figure 6.11:a-c. Once there, the garment (a flounced skirt) is formally presented to and put on the priestess (Fig. 6.3), who then emerges as the representative of the goddess (perhaps in an enacted epiphany) and sits outdoors to receive offerings (as in Fig. 6.9:a). Such offerings might 125</page><page sequence="26">SUZANNE PETERSON MURRAY include flowers, such as sea lilies, or additional gifts of cloth. The lady of the south wall, with her striding pose and deliberate placement at the far end of the enclosure (the entrance?), may reflect the processional aspect of the ceremony. A similar ceremony, though exclusively indoors, has been proposed for the Throne Room at Knossos.80 It is clear that rituals of offering were often conducted outdoors, however, as shown in the Xeste 3 frescoes (Figs. 6.6-6.8) and on numerous rings (such as in Fig. 6.9:a). The prepara- tions for such ceremonies would also include outdoor activities, such as the collection of floral gifts, transport of cult equipment (a processional activity ill suited to the interior spaces at Akrotiri), and, in this instance, dressing the goddess-surrogate (priestess or effigy) within a portable, temporary enclosure near the offering site. An interesting parallel is found on the sealing from AyiaTriada (Fig. 6.11:f),81 which shows two men, one wearing what appears to be a sacral garment, emerging in procession from a structure of pole-like elements resembling the framework of a tent or canopy. If the ritual involved the robing of a statue rather than a priestess, then the te-o-po-ri-ja (god-carrying) festival proposed by Hiller supplies a tantalizing link: the procession bringing the skirt to the textile enclosure may also have transported the cult image, or the image may, once robed, have been conveyed to a shrine (among the sea lilies?).82 A large statue, however, could not have been transported along the circuitous route from Room la to the outdoors without great difficulty-it must be imagined as originating elsewhere. What, then, would have been the purpose of the Sea Lilies Room? It does not appear to have been a focal point for the robing or offering cer- emonies described here, and seems to be an unlikely location for a cult statue, yet its decoration indicates some distinction. I would suggest that this room was used for the storage or display of the ceremonial skirts that figure so prominently in outdoor cult activities and in the ritual illustrated in the adjoining room. There is evidence that sacred garments were dis- played both indoors and outdoors, and they may have been objects of ado- ration in themselves.83 It has also been argued by Niemeier that painted rooms could have served as storage areas for sacred paraphernalia, in par- ticular that the room decorated with ikria in the West House at Akrotiri served as a storeroom for actual ikria when not in ceremonial use (notably, a use illustrated in the adjoining room, in the Miniature Fresco).84 A simi- lar relationship could be proposed for Rooms la and lb (even though no skirts are illustrated in Room la).85 No artifacts of either religious or domestic use have been found in this room,86 but they are not necessary for this interpretation of the room's function, as the display of a sacral skirt (or skirts) would leave no material remains. Other cult items associated with robe rituals could have been stored elsewhere in the building, and used as needed for small ceremonies of veneration in Room la or lb87or for larger ceremonies outdoors. In other words, a segregated storage of ceremonial equipment may have oc- curred, with sacred garments in one area, ritual vessels in another. 80. Niemeier 1987, p. 166. 81. See note 35. 82. Porter (2000) notes that the sea lilies are distinguished by a late summer flowering, when other blooms have withered. Whether such considerations could help determine a season for a festival of robing a goddess-surrogate (like the summer festival of the Greater Panathenaia) is unknown. 83. Marinatos 1986, pp. 60-61; 1993, pp. 144-145; Warren 1988, p. 22. 84. Niemeier 1992, p. 100. 85. Fresco fragments that may rep- resent bundles of flounced skirts were found in the area of the cult center at Mycenae (Kritseli-Providi 1982, pl. delta; Peterson 1981b, p. 203, no. 95). Such decoration would be appropriate to a room used to offer, display, or store these garments. 86. See note 73. 87. In the Room of the Ladies, a conical rhyton, trefoil jug, and triton shell were found (Michaelidou 2001, p. 199), an assemblage that would have appropriate ritual implications. Offer- ings of cloth or flowers would also be fitting gifts, and would leave no trace. I26</page><page sequence="27">RECONSIDERING THE THE ROOM OF THE LADIES 88. Michaelidou 2001, pp. 237-242. In Room 1, the floor repositories were packed with a variety of beautiful ves- sels, and the pottery of Room 2 in- cluded amphoras, tripod cooking pots, and a hoard of conical cups, the latter sometimes associated with drinking rituals. 89. See note 67 and Michaelidou 2001, pp. 200-217. 90. Michaelidou 2001, p. 462. 91. Michaelidou 2001, pp. 206, 250-251. Small fragments of white and yellowish plaster were scattered above the paving slabs. Marinatos (1984b, p. 97) thinks the window between Room 7 and Room la acted as a pass- through for ritual vessels. Although she bases her conclusions on vessels now identified as belonging to the floor below (see note 90 above), the window may have served a related purpose. Fig. 6.1 does not include this window or the doorways of the polythyron, as this information became available after the production of the plan. 92. As also defined in Michaelidou 2001, pp. 396-397. There is too little information to propose the storage of cult equip- ment in the rooms adjacent to the Sea Lilies Room, in part because the third story offers meager preservation, in part because it is so problematic to differentiate between domestic and religious vessels at Akrotiri. With regard to the second story, however, it should be noted that the entire north wing (Rooms 1, 2, 7) showed an abundance of pottery, including many pieces with possible ritual use.88 Room 7, adjacent to Room 1 on the west (Fig. 6.1), presents the most intriguing data. Large amounts of pottery were stored on all three levels, where it was found stacked on the floors and in cupboards, as well as hav- ing fallen in the collapse of the upper floors.89 Among the items found were many typically of cultic use (particularly conical rhyta and triton shells), although these have been associated primarily with the room of the sec- ond story.90 On the third story, Room 7 featured an interior window in the east wall, looking directly into the Sea Lilies Room, as well as a polythyron in the south wall (accessing Room 6), a stone-paved floor (as in Room 1) and perhaps plastered walls.91 Clearly this was a nice room that featured plentiful pottery stores, but also easy access from the corridor, the service stairs, and Room 6. This pattern of circulation indicates an area of greater activity,92 yet the window in the east wall presents a tantalizing link to the more secluded, exclusive Room of the Sea Lilies. While the function of this area remains obscure, a relationship with the private, vividly decorated rooms nearby is indicated. In this context, the Sea Lilies Room would serve as the starting point of the ceremony described above: the bringing forth of the sacred gar- ments stored or displayed there. Its decoration would allude symbolically to the culmination of the ritual (worship and offering) in an outdoor set- ting. The Room of the Ladies, through which the garments would pass (in procession?), would then serve not only as a transitional passage but as a signpost illustrating the progression to the next major stage of the ritual (presentation and robing). The sequential nature of this event would thus be emphasized by the outward orientation of the ladies in the composi- tion, away from the Sea Lilies Room, creating a sense of passing to the next stage, and the change in physical location would be signaled by the textile background. Ultimately, the sacred garment(s) would be returned to the Sea Lilies Room, an intimate setting perhaps appropriate for fur- ther veneration of the displayed vestments when not in use; and the ritual vessels would be put away in the other rooms (the tent perhaps in an- other?). The spatial setting, the decorative program, and the context of Minoan ritual all make this interpretation a distinct possibility. In this regard, the House of the Ladies might be viewed as both do- mestic and religious in nature. The location and size of both the Sea Lilies Room and the Room of the Ladies stress privacy and limited access, rather than public use, yet the intensive decoration of this suite, especially in relation to the rest of the house, gives it a specialized, unique character. The decoration is decidedly female-oriented, emphasizing the role of women in the context of ceremony. It would be difficult to envision Room 1 as merely a sleeping or dressing area for the women of the I27</page><page sequence="28">SUZANNE PETERSON MURRAY household, but its function may in part have been as the personal shrine of a woman, or women, who played prominent roles in the robe rituals of the community and who venerated and cared for its most cherished element: the sacral skirt.93 Perhaps we are dealing here with the residence of a priest- ess, largely private in function, but with specific areas devoted to the stor- age and care of the cult paraphernalia used in a ritual robing ceremony that was conducted elsewhere. Until we can learn more about the function of other rooms in this building, however, our understanding of its function will be limited. The questions and interpretations generated by these paintings can lead us in many directions. Robing, offering, or initiation? Priestess, goddess, statue, or initiate? The scanty preservation of the scenes in Room lb leaves us clues that are intriguing and tantalizing but maddeningly insufficient, and the extant fragments of Lady 3 present many anomalies that test our assumptions about Aegean iconography. To determine more about this scene, we need additional information about Lady 3, about the iconogra- phy of robe rituals, and about the decoration of the adjoining walls. Trying to decipher Aegean iconography is like entering a maze. It is full of twists and turns, dead ends, and uncertain outcomes. New archaeo- logical information can simplify our path or complicate it further. The paintings from Akrotiri have done both, and those from the House of the Ladies seem to present more questions than answers. Many of the ideas presented here must remain conjectural, part of the continuing enigma of the House of the Ladies and the greater mystery of Minoan ritual. 93. Michaelidou (2001, p. 470), in defining the most private sectors of the houses at Akrotiri, also notes the "cele- bration of cult in the innermost space of the house."
