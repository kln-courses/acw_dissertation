<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS Tufhell, Olga : Lachish III (Teil ed-Duweir): The Iron Age. With contributions by Margaret A. Murray &amp; D. Diringer. Lon don: Oxford University Press, 1953. 2 vols.: Text437pp.; Plates 8 pp. + 130 plates and plans. ?8. 8j. Od. Lachish III is without doubt the most important and exhaustive study so far to be published of the material culture of Palestine during the Iron Age, owing to the extremely rich material found on the mound, the systematic recording in the field, the meticulous analytical and com parative method of study and the compre hensive and lucid presentation. The Introduction deals with the history of the expedition, the identification of the Iron Age sites associated with La chish in certain topographical passages of the Bible, and with the geographical po sition of the tell, all matters pertinent to its identification. The introduction con cludes with a summary of the principal literary sources on ancient Lachish. Part I 'History and Archaeology' comprises a survey of the archaeological aspects and typical features of each phase, fitting them into the historical frame work. This task is not always easy; the results indeed were many, but they are somewhat inconclusive, undoubtedly because of the sudden interruption of the work on the tragic death of J.L. Starkey. Thus, the historical reconstruction un dertaken by the author is as yet tentative. Part II The City' deals with the stratification of the site. This, too, is as yet unclear in many respects. This section also contains a careful account of the architectural features including the Iron Age Citadel, fortifications, houses and the post-exilic remains. Owing to the ingenuity of the excavators, three separate building phases were distinguished in the construction of the platforms which served as foundations for the Iron Age Palace-forts. Of the superstructures of Palace A no traces remain and those of Palaces and C are only distinguished by a few burnt patches of plastered floors. On the ruins of these structures was built the well planned and spacious Persian residence. A new and striking parallel to it may be seen in a public building uncovered in stratum VI (the Persian pe riod) at Tell Qasile. Only part of the plan of this building has so far been published (IE/, 1, 1950-51, p. 70, Fig. 2). Another isolated building of some interest is the so-called 'Solar Shrine' at Lachish, which owes its name to its east-west orientation and to the presence of an altar. The in itial date of the building is not clear, but it was still in use in the second century b.c. The date of the important city gate and the comparative dates of the different sections of the magnificent Iron Age city walls cannot be conclusively established until further investigation. More excavation will also be needed to clear up the comparatively unknown history of the town during the Early Iron Age. There seems to have been a period of partial desertion, lasting till c. 1000 b.c. Of special importance in this phase are a few Philistine sherds and two tombs containing anthropomorphic coffins (as yet unpublished). Level V has only been tentatively sound ed; it is dated to 1000-900 b.c. To this 61</page><page sequence="2">62 REVIEWS level may belong the podium of Palace A attributed to the period of the United Monarchy. The Judaean city was after wards well fortified by Rehoboam against a possible attack from the south. In Level IV (9th century b.c.) the city expanded under Asa andjehoshaphat, the citadel was enlarged and the walls rebuilt. Hezekiah probably built the additional defences and a big shaft of Level III against the Assyrian menace. The excava tion verified the version of the fall of Lachish depicted in the Nineveh reliefs. The city was completely destroyed by Sennacherib in 700 b.c. The new city of Level II belongs to the 7th century b.c. and was destroyed in its turn by the Babylonians in 588 b.c. The excavator suggests another period of desertion after this destruction, lasting until 450 b.c. The topmost level (i) be longs to the time of the return from Baby lon. After Alexander's conquest, the city deteriorated until its final abandonment, c. 150 b.c. Part HI. The third part of the book deals with the cemeteries and miscel laneous structural features on the sur rounding slopes of the tell, including a complete account of the structural fea tures of the tombs, accompanied by a full register of finds and lists of comparative material. Four large burial deposits represent a consecutive series of pottery and other objects from c. 925 b.c. to 588 b. c. ; they are used as a chronological guide to build up the sequence of the rich tomb groups (p. 50). Part IV deals with the objects by categories.The first and major chapter is an excellent presentation of the Middle Iron Age pottery. The pottery finds from the stratified city levels and the tomb groups are treated together and supple ment each other in many respects. Typo logically the well preserved tomb material helped to identify and reconstruct the mostly incomplete specimens from the city levels. Of this rich material Miss Tufnell has made a detailed analytical study which will without doubt become the standard reference work on Middle Iron Age pot tery. The pottery has been arranged into main classes and into subdivisions, ac cording to type, function, manufacture and finish. The development of each type has been closely traced, its distribution and frequency of forms recorded in charts, and full comparative material added from the main published sites in Pales tine and elsewhere, including the very pertinent but still unpublished Samaria material. The presentation of the pottery series starts with the open forms of the bowl types, which are the simplest as well as the most common of all ceramic shapes. However, as Miss Tufnell notes, these are also the most difficult and frustrating to classify. The bowls are divided into three main classes and eleven subdivi sions, taking into account the very smal lest variation in shape and technique. Added to this is an analysis of the bur nish on the bowls, following the transi tion from hand-burnishing and using it as a chronological guide. The result of this analysis shows that the use of wheel burnish was introduced at about the be ginning of the 9th century b.c. and re placed hand-burnishing completely at the end of the 8th century. These conclusions agree on the whole with similar develop</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 63 ments on other sites (Tell Beit Mirsim Level A, Megiddo Levels IV, III, Qasile Levels Vili, VII). A hypothetic chrono logical sequence is based on all the above mentioned facts, which are also shown graphically in a concise distribution chart (p. 325). The author's extreme conscien tiousness in the presentation of all the evidence and a proliferation of detail at times obscure the general outlines of the subject. Moreover the published excava tion reports on other sites are sometimes taken at their face value, without refe rence to subsequent corrections. A strik ing example is the use of a far too high dating of Megiddo Level V, as given by the excavators, namely 1050-1000 b.c. It has since been proved by Albright (AASOR, 21-22, 1943, p. 29, n. io) that this level is identical with Level IVB and the now generally accepted date for Level VA-IVB is c. 950-920 b.c. Such wrong attributions distort some aspects of the ceramic classification. Another source of error is the occasional inconsistency of the dates given to the various loci; sometimes there are even differences between them in the various places where they are mentioned. Diringer in his chapter on the Early Hebrew Inscriptions presents a newly revised transliteration and translation of the famous Lachish ostraca, in the light of the large amount of literature published since 19 3 8 ( a full bibliography is given on pp. 21-23). Of special interest is his detailed study of the large collection of the controversial la-melekh stamps. He divides the stamps epigraphically and typologically into three groups, assign ing them respectively to the beginning or middle of the 8th century, the end of the 8th century, and the 7th century b.c. The site has also produced a remark able collection of weights, six of which are inscribed with early Hebrew letters As they were not found in a stratified context, Diringer tries to date them to the 7th-6th centuries b.c. by comparing them with his classification of the la-me lekh stamps. As can be seen from this necessarily very general survey, Miss Tufnell and her collaborators have done everything to make the book as perfect as possible. The publication is of a very high stand ard, but unfortunately the same cannot be said of the drawings and photographs of pottery. This blemish should not, how ever, diminish our appreciation of the lasting value of the work. Trude K. Dothan</page></plain_text>
