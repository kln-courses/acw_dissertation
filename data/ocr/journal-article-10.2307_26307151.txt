THE STONE SCULPTURE OF ANCIENT WEST MEXICO Description and interpretation Eduardo Williams Centro de Estudios Antropológicos, El Colegio de Michoacán, Martínez de Navarrete 505, 59690 Zamora, Michoacán, México Abstract Iconographic analysis of the Prehispanic stone sculpture of West Mexico (Jalisco, Colima, Nayarit, and Michoacan) has revealed several iconographic themes, which are interpreted using ethnographic analogy with the Huichol Indians and other groups, as well as ethnohistorical information from West Mexico, central Mexico, and other areas. A total of seven iconographic themes have been identified: (1) human heads, (2) human skulls, (3) double figures, (4) anthropozoomorphic figures, (5) anthropomorphic braziers, (6) horned figures, and (7) hunchbacked figures. One shared meaning that appears in one form or another in most themes is fertility. It is proposed that these sculptures were sacred objects whose possible function was to symbolize the deified ancestors or deities that were ultimately responsible for rain and agricultural fertility. This article deals with the symbolism of Prehispanic stone sculpture from West Mexico (Jalisco, Colima, Nayarit, and Michoacan). It is based on the analysis of a sculptural corpus consisting of more than 200 pieces currently found in several museums and private collections in Mexico, the United States, and Europe (Williams 1988). The sculptural corpus consists of anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and anthropozoomorphic fig ures of relatively small dimensions (normally not exeeding 1 m in height). Lack of archaeological context has made dating this material difficult, but a comparative stylistic study suggests a date of ca. a.d. 700 for the initiation of the sculptural tradition, which continued until the Spanish conquest (Williams 1988:118). Because virtually none of the objects in this study come from controlled archaeological excavations, little can be said about their function based on a contextual analysis. How ever, ethnohistoric data and ethnographic analogy provide a hy pothesis regarding the possible meaning of these sculptures, as well as the role they played among the ancient cultures of West Mexico. The basis for interpretation is the analogy with present-day native groups, such as the Huichol and Cora of western Mex ico, the Pueblo Indians of the American Southwest, and several native groups from South America. Equally important as a source of information is the ethnohistoric record from west and central Mexico. One of the most difficult problems faced by the archaeolo gist in Mesoamerica is the interpretation of Prehispanic sym bolism. In the case of Mesoamerican art, there is still debate among scholars on whether or not one can use ethnographic data as a basis for interpretation. The use of Huichol ethno graphic data to "explain" ancient symbolism in West Mexico has been questioned by several scholars, such as Phil Weigand (1985:143) and R. E. Taylor (1970): When we turn to the task of interpreting the religious signif icance of the archaeological materials derived from the west ern Mexican shaft-tomb tradition, the necessity for extreme caution seems quite evident. On the most elementary level, the link to the ethnographic and/or documentary data is tenuous since the shaft-tomb tradition seems to have come to an end not later than the fifth century a.d. —approxi mately a thousand years removed from the pertinent ethno graphic sources.(p. 166) These reservations are shared by George Kubler (1984), who has said the following regarding the problem of interpreting Prehispanic culture using ethnographic analogy: Recently Peter Furst has sought to connect living Cora and Huichol ethnography with West Mexican archaeology, on the score of shamanism. . . . The hypothesis is attractively sim ple, but it presupposes that ancient peoples were less change able and more alike than the archaeological finds warrant. It also avoids the possibility that modern shamanism is a re cent rustic development among peoples of Catholic tradition in isolated environments, (p. 195) Although some of Taylor's and Kubler's statements are true, if we were to follow their advice a whole range of anthropolog ical information would have to be discarded when looking for ways to better understand the meaning implicit in West Mex ico's archaeological record, in particular its artistic traditions. Ethnographic analogy is in some cases the only approach that 181</page><page sequence="2">182 Williams can help give some meaning to the fragments of matter that comprise the archaeological record. Gordon Willey (1973) said the following regarding this problem: I do not suppose we will ever be able to link form to mean ing in the prehistoric past with absolute surety; however, I think we will approach high probability. To do this we have to utilize both general comparative and specific historical analogy. . . . There are some aspects of past life, principally those in the ideological realm, that can be satisfactorily explained only with the aid of specific historical analogy, (p. 161) In short, we are left with a complex situation, in which not everything Huichol can be readily accepted as a remnant from ancient times. On the other hand, several structural parallels be tween Huichol and Prehispanic worldview have been docu mented, consisting of, among others, division of the universe in four quarters and a central axis, with certain colors and dei ties associated with each quarter (Shelton 1989), as well as the belief in past creations, each one with a dominant deity and each one being destroyed by a specific element (Shelton 1990:71). (See Zingg 1982:324-325 for more on Aztec-Huichol cultural parallels.) ICONOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS The analysis of the sculptural corpus under discussion deter mines the existence of seven iconographic themes (Figure 1), which are summarized here: Theme I: Human Heads These figures have been interpreted as representing human heads that have been separated from the bodies of sacrificial victims (Figure 2). Decapitation was a widespread activity in the ancient world, including Mesoamerica. In fact, Paul Kirchhoff (1943:106) mentions "headhunting" in his list of typical Meso american traits. Furthermore, according to Moser (1973:5), "de capitation, from all evidence, seems to have been an integral part of indigenous ceremonial life, warfare, and personal achievement from a considerably early era and through most of Mexico and Central America." Although few historical references of decapitation exist in West Mexico, what little can be found in the literature is il luminating. Moser (1973:7) presents a summary of the major historical accounts of decapitation in West Mexico. During the first half of the seventeenth century, the Acaxee of Durango and Sinaloa would decapitate fallen enemies in warfare and dis play the heads and bones in "strong houses." Another group, the Cora of Nayarit, had ceremonial houses in which they kept the heads of enemies captured in raids or battles. Bones and skulls of dead enemies, along with idols, were also used by the Acaxee in planting ceremonies (Beals 1933:16). Other northern groups that reportedly practiced head taking include the Tara humare, Yaqui, Tepahue, Sinaloa, and Tepehuanes (Beals 1932:Table 80, Map 18), as well as the Xixime (a group south of the Acaxee) and the Tescoquines of southwestern Nayarit (Moser 1973:7). Archaeological evidence of decapitation in West Mexico comes from several excavations throughout the area and reveals Human heads Human skulls Double figures Anthropo-zoomorphic figures Anthropomorphic braziers Horned figures Hunchbacks Figure 1. Iconographic themes, by region. Figure 2. Human head (southern jalisco); height: 23 cm. (Museo de las Culturas de Occidente, Ciudad Guzmán, Jalisco) the practice from the Formative to the Postclassic periods. In Chupicuaro, Guanajuato, an excavated cemetery dating from the Formative showed horizontally cut skulls, painted and per forated for suspension. Decapitated skeletons and skull burials further illustrate a well-developed death cult (Porter 1956:532). Another example of decapitation was found at Tizapan el Alto, Jalisco, a Postclassic site on the shores of Lake Chapala. Discovered was a total of five male skeletons lacking skulls, mandibles, and upper cervical vertebrae, features "strongly sug gesting that those individuals had been decapitated prior to in terment" (Meighan and Foote 1968:54). An unmistakable case of decapitation is that reported from La Terla, near Tuxpan,</page><page sequence="3">Stone sculpture of ancient West Mexico 183 Figure 3. Human skull with tenon (jalisco); height: 37 cm, total length with tenon: 53 cm. (Museo Regional de Guadalajara) Jalisco (Deraga 1985), where an accidental find uncovered six human skulls, each one interred in a large ceramic vessel cov ered by an inverted vessel. More archaeological examples of de capitation in West Mexico are summarized elsewhere (Williams 1988:132-134). Although decapitation is not, of course, the only interpre tation to account for the meaning of the sculptures discussed here, in light of the evidence this would seem a valid explana tion. Furthermore, some of the sculptures in the present icono graphic theme have a concavity at the top, which may have been used as a receptacle for offerings as part of a "head cult complex." An alternative, though not necessarily contradictory, interpretation for this latter feature is offered by Peter Furst. Regarding a Huichol myth, Furst says that Ramón (a Huichol informant) called the human soul kupuri, using the same word he had used for fontanelle, the osseous zone that grows in an infant's cranium to cover the area originally open, and explain ing that the fontanelle, the place where the essence of life re sides, and the soul "are the same thing." At death the vital essence of a person escapes through the top of the head (Furst 1972:10-12). Human heads were represented in West Mexico not only in stone, but also in clay (e.g., Kan, Meighan, and Nicholson 1970:Figs. 123, 127, 129). In some cases detached heads are shown with horns, which, as discussed later, are a sign of su pernatural or shamanic power. One type of ceramic figurine from Colima shows a seated individual wearing a horned head dress, drinking from a vessel, and sporting two trophy heads suspended by crossed shoulder straps (Moser 1973:P1. 12). This scene could be interpreted as a ritual one in which decapitated heads are being used as "power objects" or some kind of mag ical amulets. As discussed elsewhere (Williams 1988:162), this type of ritual scene may have been linked with rites of agricul tural fertility. Theme II: Human Skulls Skull figures are rare in West Mexico, particularly in stone (Fig ure 3). The most straightforward interpretation of skull images associates them with concepts of death and the underworld. The example in Figure 3 is fitted with a tenon at the back, proba bly to be used as a decorative element in a structure similar to the central Mexican tzompantli, or skull rack. This type of structure had a wide distribution in Mesoamerica, from Yuca tan to Zacatecas. Perhaps the best-known case of a tzompantli in northwestern Mexico is that of Alta Vista, Zacatecas, where E. A. Kelley excavated the structure known as the "Temple of the Skulls." The most remarkable feature of this structure was the "array of skeletal material lying on the floor" (Kelley 1978:108). Several skulls found in this and other structures at the site displayed a small hole drilled at the apex of the skull. Kelley concludes that "trophy heads (probably defleshed skulls) and long bones are represented in this collection . . . they were suspended from a bone rack or from the roof or walls of the</page><page sequence="4">184 Williams temple (Kelley 1978:115). The site of Cerro del Huistle, in northern Jalisco, provides another example of a tzompantli (Hers, Callut, and Reginster 1981). The tzompantli had an eminently religious meaning for its builders and users, as it was closely associated with human sac rifice, at least in Postclassic central Mexico, where the ethno historical information is more abundant. The second item in this theme (Figure 4) is unique in that it is a double figure with opposing death (skeletal) faces. Dual dei ties in Mesoamerica and other areas, such as the American Southwest, have undertones of fertility and generation, and the apparent contradiction between death figures and fertility is dis pelled by J. L. Furst (1982): The association of skeletal imagery with death may not re flect indigenous thought so much as the experience of West ern culture. ... In fact, skeletal symbols seem to have conveyed a very different meaning among indigenous iconog raphy. Among the Mixtees . . . some, if not all, skeletal fig ures were the antithesis of death gods. Indeed, they were deities with generative and life-sustaining functions, (pp. 207-221) Among the Huichol Indians, sacred cavities, which lead to the underworld, are associated with lakes and lagoons, which suggests a close relationship with water deities. Furthermore, Nakawé, Goddess of Fertility, also has underworld attributes. One of her homes is said to be underground, where plants ger minate from her body (Shelton 1990:54). At least among the Aztecs, death symbolism is also associ ated with the earth. The Aztec deities of the earth, linked with agriculture and human life in general, were also associated with the underworld and death (Klein 1975:70-71). In summary, it is proposed that while the first sculpture (Figure 3) is associated with death and the underworld, the second one (Figure 4) may have the additional meaning of fertility. Theme III: Double Figures This theme has been interpreted as representing the concept of duality (Figure 5). Dualism was a widespread and pervasive con cept in Mesoamerican religious thinking (Nicholson 1971:409). In Mexico and Central America, figures portraying the duality principle are known from the earliest chronological levels. Ac cording to Nicholson (1971), A fundamental characteristic of Mesoamerican pantheonic systems in general was the conception of deity in dual, quad ruple or quintuple form. The duality principle was especially important in its application to the creative celestial deity(ies), but was also inherent in the consort system, which, though apparently not universal, was very common, (p. 409) Ethnohistorical sources from central Mexico tell of Ometecuhtli, the "Lord of Duality," whose metaphysical abode is Omeyocan, or "Place of Duality." He is also given the more abstract name Ometeotl, "God of Duality." The name of his consort is Omecihuatl, "Dual Lady." The God of Duality was a deity of fundamental importance. In fact, according to León Portilla (1978:80-83), "Ometeotl is the cosmic principle by which all that exists is conceived and begotten." West Mexico was no exception to this pan-Mesoamerican preoccupation with a dual deity or with dual beings representing some ancient prin ciple or belief; several ceramic figures from the Jalisco-Colima Nayarit area show dualistic attributes (Kan, Meighan, and Nicholson 1970:Figs. 8, 29, 72, 170). In Huichol mythology, a two-headed serpent surrounds the world, and the sun when setting must pass between its two heads. Representations of this snake, made of clay, were left in sacred places as prayers for rain (Lumholtz 1900:80). A simi lar myth might explain the representation of a two-headed snake arching its body over a human being seen in a Colima vessel (Furst 1973:Fig. 5; Gallagher 1983:Fig. 21). Among the Pueblo Indians of the American Southwest, the concept of duality is also an important component of ritual worldview. For example, among the Zuni and Hopi any twin birth is attributed to solar agency. Twins figure in a great num ber of Zuni myths and folk tales, often as naughty or bad lit tle boys who disobey or plague their mother, play ball, free the world from monsters, turn the inhospitable into stone, or steal salt from animals and masks from the kachinas (Parsons 1939:183, 204). The concept of duality is also found in Pueblo art. The serpent painted on Acoma walls is double-headed, and so is the Water Serpent of Shipaulovi. These figures may be linked with a double- or triple-headed snake found in the north west coast, which has a head at each end and a human head in the middle (Parsons 1939:185). Theme IV: Anthropozoomorphic Figures Theme IV has been interpreted as a representation of super natural beings that combine human and animal attributes (Fig ure 6). In ancient Mesoamerica, and currently in rural and In dian Mexico, there is a common belief in magicians or sorcerers that transform themselves into animals. Nicholson (1971:439) says that among the Aztecs "the basic generic term for magician was nahualli, which was also used for his disguise, i.e., the an imal or object into which he could transform himself, the most striking manifestation of his power." Often this concept of a dual being or "nagual" is the product of a belief in a mythical event in which an animal with sacred or totemic connotations, such as the jaguar, mates with a human being. This concept is apparently widespread in native America, and since Olmec times it has appeared in Mesoamerica. The Huichol Indians of West Mexico have retained in their belief system several concepts that reflect this idea of supernat ural beings combining both human and animal attributes: Even more emotionally intense than achieving unity with Caoyomari (the male ancestor deity) is transformation into wolf form . . . this "superhuman" ability is developed through intimate contact with wolves. Aspiring Huichols learn from wolves how to take their form ... the process of transfor mation into wolf form is a numinous experience which oc curs apart from publicly performed rituals. Nevertheless, some Huichols claim to have witnessed this metamorphosis and all informants regard it as the ultimate esoteric achieve ment. (Fikes 1985:284) Huichol wolf nagualism is based on the belief that wolves were formerly people, and that wolves and men have a common</page><page sequence="5">Stone sculpture of ancient West Mexico ' 85 Figure 4. Dual head with skeletal attributes Qalisco); height: 37.5 cm. (Museo Regional de Guadalajara)</page><page sequence="6">186 Williams Figure 5. Human figure with dualistic attributes (Tuxpan, Jalisco); height: 48 cm. (Museo Regional de Guadalajara) ancestor, Camóquime. Wolves, which are seen as the Huichol's "elder brothers," are asked for help to hunt deer (Fikes 1985:259). Ethnohistoric sources from several areas of West Mexico suggest that nagualism may have been a central religious theme in ancient times, just as it was during the Contact period and later among the still remaining native populations. For exam ple, the Relación de Asuchitlán (Michoacan), written in 1579, relates how the Indians of that area would dive into deep riv ers and emerge transformed into tigers, lions, alligators, or snakes. According to the Relación, the Indians "would really transform themselves into these figures, just like the witches in Spain" (Ochoa and Sánchez 1985:40). The concept of the nagual or transforming witch is inti mately related with shamanism. A case in point is that of the Colombian Tunebo who believe that their shamans "are occa sionally able to visit an otherworldly sphere where they turn into man-eating jaguars" (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975:47). These ex tranormal experiences were fostered by the use of hallucino genic drugs, a practice that may also have been present in West Mexico (Furst 1973:Fig. 3). Theme V: Anthropomorphic Braziers This iconographic theme has been interpreted as representing a fire deity (Figure 7). These figures have been identified as braziers possibly associated with the Mesoamerican cult of a fire deity on the basis of several diagnostic iconographic elements that are found either in all or in at least some of these figures (not all figures share all the elements). These elements are as fol lows: seated position, hunched forward, and legs crossed in front; brazier or vessel on the head or back; circular earspools and geometric "diamond-and-bars" design on the side of ves sel (Williams 1988:Figs. 8-19). There is some evidence, both archaeological and ethnohis torical, of religious practices centered around the worship of a</page><page sequence="7">Stone sculpture of ancient West Mexico 1 87 Figure 6. Anthropozoomorphic figure (Michoacan); height: 63 cm. (Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, Los Angeles, California) fire deity in West Mexico (Schóndube 1974:175-177). The evi dent importance of the fire deity with whom these braziers are associated may be explained by the constant volcanic activity in some areas of West Mexico. In the area around the Volcan de Colima, for example, the constant fiery outbursts and gases coming out of the volcano's caldera must have been an impres sive spectacle for the Prehispanic inhabitants of the area, who understood this phenomenon to be a manifestation of the fire deity's anger: "They came to the temple to pray for the welfare of their crops and to free themselves from the god Xiutitecuhtli or Huehueteotl, who sent them fire and lightning. They thought this god lived in the Fuego Volcano and that he tried to destroy Figure 7. Anthropomorphic brazier (Colima); height: 22 cm. (Museo Regional de Guadalajara) their agricultural fields" (Relación de Colima Tecalitlán, eigh teenth century, taken from Schondube 1974:176). According to the sixteenth century Relación de Michoacán, during certain feasts the Cazonci (ruler) would bring wood from the temples throughout the entire province; the wood would be stacked in large piles in a patio. After building high fires in the houses of the high priests, a priest would offer prayers to the god of fire (Craine and Reindrop 1970:20). Such was the impor tance of the fire deity in ancient Michoacan that the high priest had charge of the wood for the fireplaces of the god of fire, as well as the corresponding insignia. Always on the eve of battle, a chief addressed his men thus: "Take this knife, with it I fed the fire god who makes fire in the midst of the chief priest's houses" (Craine and Reindrop 1970:137). What we classify as inanimate objects or phenomena, such as the sun and fire, are regarded by the Huichol Indians as be ings with an inner form and ultimate source that is animate and essentially human. This vital animate dimension is the realm in habited by the ancestor deities (Fikes 1985:103). To the Huichol, fire is Tatevali or Tatehuari, meaning "our grandfather." The Huichol have created a very elaborate religious complex around fire. A fire is lit in all ceremonies, and shamans talk to it be cause Grandfather Fire was the first and greatest of all shamans (Zingg 1982:497-498). For the Huichol, fire is not a simple phe nomenon having practical consequences to be explained scien tifically. It is a divine person, to whom one talks and offers food especially cooked for it. Fire is, together with the sun fa ther, the principal figure in religious ceremonies (Zingg 1982: 498, 505). Among the Huichol, the sun is also considered a god, called Tayau (our father). This sun-father is a personification of the star, just like Grandfather Fire is a personification of fire. In the Huichol mind, all ceremonies dedicated to the sun cult must be faithfully observed; otherwise, the sun would burn all their fields, with catastrophic results (Zingg 1982:507-508). It is not surprising that the Huichol should link these two deities, as sun</page><page sequence="8">188 Williams Figure 8. Horned figure (West Mexico); height: 39.5 cm. (Museo Regional de Guadalajara) and fire deities have been linked in the same cult complex since early in the Prehispanic sequence (Nicholson 1971:Table 3). Theme VI: Homed Figures Deity figures with "horns" or horned headdresses or hairdos are not uncommon in Mesoamerica (Figure 8). In central Mexico, they have been associated with Xiuhtecuhtli, the fire god (Soli's Olguin 1982:Figs. 2-3), and with Xochiquetzal, goddess of love (Spranz 1982:Fig. 3), among others. Deity identification is not always certain, as ambiguity is an inherent characteristic of the Mesoamerican system of symbols. Esther Pasztory, in her study of Aztec sculpture, describes "a number of old men having two protuberances on their heads. The figures are seated, their crossed arms resting on flexed knees. Age is suggested by tooth less gums, or by two remaining teeth projecting over the lower lip" (Pasztory 1983:Figs. 193-194). Although identification of these figures with a given Aztec deity is far from certain, it is important to see that horned figures were important elements in the Mesoamerican symbolic system. In West Mexico, horned figures made of pottery have been found in a wide area, from the Jalisco-Colima-Nayarit shaft tomb area to northern Jalisco and Zacatecas (Williams 1988: 154). In Cerro Encantado, near Teocaltiche, Jalisco, Betty Bell found a very distinctive type of ceramic figurine associated with burials and consisting of both male and female figurines, the former of which usually has two hornlike projections on the top of the head. These figurines have been dated at ca. a.d. 100 250 (Bell 1974:158). Peter Furst, offering an interpretation for horned figures, says that "almost universally the horn has been the insignia of supernatural power, especially shamanic power or the power of the gods" (Furst 1974:135). To the Huichol, the horned toad is the "animal of our grandfather," the god of fire, and first sha man. Its horns associate it with the deer, which is the most sa cred of all the animals among the Cora and Huichol (Furst 1973:120). In fact, deer, peyote, and maize are part of a single ritual complex in the Huichol religious system, a complex that dominates most ritual activity (Zingg 1982:439). Horns are also equated in Aztec art with maize. The horns of an Aztec sculp ture now in Basel's Museum fiir Vólkerkunde appear to repre sent ears of maize, which are also seen in the headdresses of Tonacatecuhtli and Ometeotl in the codices (Pasztory 1983:223, Fig. 194). In West Mexico perhaps stone sculptures with horns are in some way related to this deer-maize-peyote complex, which is of such paramount importance that it may be considered to be quite old, existing since ancient times in this culture area. Fur thermore, from a purely ecological viewpoint, deer hunting has been an important activity in Mesoamerica since at least the Ar chaic period; thus, it is reasonable to identify a horned figure with the deer, which eventually acquired ritual significance. The importance of the deer, a symbol of sustenance and fertility, is so great that it pervades the Huichol ritual cycle. For example, deer blood is sprinkled on maize before it is planted to ensure fertility. This sacrifice is necessary; otherwise, the gods would deny rain, good harvests, health, and life (Lumholtz 1904:42). Although there is no certainty that the deer-maize-peyote complex goes back to Prehispanic times, what is almost certain beyond any reasonable doubt is that representations of horned beings, whether executed in clay or stone, are to be interpreted as supernatural beings charged with magicoreligious power. Theme VII: Hunchbacked Figures Representations of individuals afflicted with physical deformi ties are common in Prehispanic art, especially in West Mexican clay figures. Among these deformed figures, hunchbacks are prominently represented (Figure 9) and are found in a wide area of the New World, including North, Central, and South Amer ica (Linné 1943). This abundance of hunchbacks in art proba bly indicates that they were part of a belief system in which they were either feared or revered in many, if not all, of the New World cultures; and in Mesoamerica this belief goes back to the Formative period, if not earlier (Linné 1943:Fig. 3). Accord ing to von Winning's (1974:32-34) study of West Mexican shaft tomb figures, among the figures portraying deformed and diseased persons, hunchbacks predominate. With very few ex ceptions they are shown in a seated position, one that makes the hump more obvious. Von Winning (1974) recognizes three kinds of hunchbacks in ceramic figurines: (1) with rounded bulbous</page><page sequence="9">Stone sculpture of ancient West Mexico '89 Figure 9. Hunchbacked figure (Colima); height: 40 cm. (Museo de Colima) back; (2) with bilateral swelling, occasionally asymmetrical, on each side of the spine; and (3) with protruding spine, vertebrae, and rib cage modeled in detail. Among these hunchbacked fig ures, most are naked and sexless, but some wear breechclouts. According to von Winning (1974), the relatively high frequency of hunchbacked figures in West Mexico does not necessarily mean that an unusually large number of individuals were thus afflicted; it does suggest, however, that these persons held a spe cial position in the social order. Most likely, hunchbacks were believed to possess both evil and benevolent supernatural pow ers, and they were probably either sorcerers or shamans (von Winning 1974:32-34). It is well known that in Late Postclassic times hunchbacks had a special place in Aztec society. In describing Moctezuma's court, Bernal Díaz del Castillo (1982:185) said the following: "Sometimes at mealtime there were some hunchbacked Indians, quite ugly, short of body and broken, bent at the middle. Some of them were jesters, others were tricksters, who told jokes, while others danced and sang." The exalted place these mal formed people had in Aztec society is seen in a statement made by Cortés (1908:266): "There was another house in Moctezuma's palace where many monstrous men and women lived, amongst whom there were dwarfs, hunchbacks, and deformed; and ev ery manner of monster had a room apart, and they also had persons to take charge of them." Whether as sorcerers, shamans, or just as "court jesters," hunchbacks were certainly perceived of as extraordinary indi viduals, and they probably were thought to have some sort of</page><page sequence="10">190 Williams supernatural power. This explains why they were so profusely represented in West Mexican art, including stone sculpture. Hunchbacked beings are also present in American South western art, at least from Mimbres times (ca. a.d. 1000-1130), if not before (LeBlanc 1983:Figs. 6, 83). In the Pueblo Indian traditions, a hunchbacked character known as Kokopelli is a mischievous spirit with clear erotic-reproductive connotations. He is an insect kachina (spirit) who is "a hunter who seduces girls or makes them bridal moccasins and whose 'hump' is really a gift-containing sack" (Parsons 1939:191). According to Hopi belief, Kokopelli appears sometimes as a masculine character and sometimes as a female: "It is customary for most of the Hopi kachinas to appear in both male and female impersona tions . . . sometimes the female is spoken of as the 'partner' of the male, and sometimes she is called his sister" (Titiev 1939:91). Hunchbacked figures in West Mexico, regardless of their possible meaning, are to be seen as representations of beings with important magical or ritual attributes. The seven iconographic themes discussed above are so var ied and different among themselves that it would appear as if there is no general concept or shared meaning that would help categorize all or most of them into a single symbolic or concep tual complex. However, under closer scrutiny there is one shared meaning that appears in one form or another in five of the iconographic themes (i.e., Themes I-V): fertility.1 Agricul tural fertility has been a preoccupation of Mesoamerican farm ers since the inception of plant husbandry millennia ago; it is, therefore, not surprising that this theme should be important in West Mexico, just as it is in all other areas of Mesoamerica. Each of these five iconographic themes may have more than one meaning; fertility is not the only meaning and surely not the most important in every case. All the same, recognition of this symbolic meaning is a first step toward the interpretation of these sculptures. The two last iconographic themes (VI-VII) can be linked indirectly to fertility (Williams 1988:164-165), but their most certain interpretation would be merely as "sacred fig ures" probably associated with ritual practices and religious be liefs. STONE SCULPTURE AND ANCIENT WEST MEXICAN SOCIETY Most ethnohistorical sources that deal with stone sculpture at the period of first European contact with the indigenous soci eties of West Mexico leave no doubt that these objects of stone served as sacred images. In all likelihood, they represent gods, spirits, supernatural forces, or deified ancestors. An early source dealing with the Tepehuanes of the Sierra de Nayarit is illuminating: The priests found an idol much celebrated among these peo ple. It was made of stone, five palmos in height, with a man's head, the rest of the body being like a column. It was at the top of a small hill in their town. Close to it were found many offerings of arrows, animal bones, jars, herbs, tree branches and beads like those used for their adornment. Another small stone idol shaped like a snail was close to the main figure. (Pérez de Ribas 1944:588) In some cases human sacrifice is said to have been associated with sacred figures of stone, as in Ameca, Jalisco: The rites and adorations they had in their gentility involved a stone idol, which they had in a temple called teocalli . . . this idol was kept inside a small, square reed box with a lid, and it could not be seen by everyone, but only by the priests in charge of the temple. . . . This idol was not made by them; it was made by their ancestors, who carved it many years ago. . . . They only entered this house of adoration when they defeated their enemies . . . who were sacrificed to their idol. (Leyva 1988:35) Not all objects worshipped by these peoples were "idols" in the strict sense of the word; in some cases, reference is made to small, unmodified stones, pebbles, or projectile points that were seen as objects of worship. In fact, this custom has survived un til recent times in Huichol ritual (Lumholtz 1900:63). Ortega (1754) tells us of the Nayeritas of the eighteenth century: The first and major idol, worshipped more than any other by the Nayeritas, was a white stone . . . which they called Tayaoppa, which means "father of the living." In it they wor shipped the sun . . . the second idol object of their affection was the one worshipped . . . with the sweet name of Tate, which means "Our Mother" . . . this idol consisted of two white stones. ... It would be impossible to count this crowd of idols; there hardly is a hill in half the province in which I have not stumbled upon these infernal figures. ... In one of these rivers in the Sierra, in a distance of only 18 leagues there were 14 idols, which now lie buried and forgotten, (pp. 13-15) According to the Relación de Zapotlán (1580) and the Rela ción de Tamazula (both in the state of Jalisco), the indigenous inhabitants of the area "had a stone for god," one which they adorned with clothes, chalchihuites (green stones), silver, feath ers, and many other things. "Sorcerers" spoke with this stone, and it spoke and answered through them. Victims would be sac rificed to sacred figures of this kind (Ochoa and Sánchez 1985:148-149, 153). The use of stone sculptures as objects of worship has sur vived among some indigenous cultures of West Mexico. The best example of this practice comes from the Huichol Indians (Hers 1982:Fig. 2). When Carl Lumholtz visited several Huichol communities at the turn of the century, he was able to docu ment an important cult centered on the worship of the sun, the rain, the deer, and other natural phenomena. As one of the first outsiders to have full access to most Huichol sanctuaries in these communities, Lumholtz observed, photographed, and col lected ethnographic material, including stone "idols." Of these he made the following remarks (1900): In the temples of the Huichols no idols are to be seen, as they are kept in sacred places, often in some remote cave . . . im ages of gods are still made among the Huichols according to the orders of the shaman; and their purpose is to prevent a drought, or to drive off some serious disease or other tribal 'This idea cannot be fully developed here for lack of space. 1 have discussed elsewhere the possible link between the iconographic themes discussed here and the concept of fertility (Williams 1988:161-165). Even those iconographic themes that do not appear to have an obvious con nection with fertility, such as anthropozoomorphic figures, can acquire that meaning when they are analyzed in the context of "shamanic art" and are compared with other artistic traditions of Mesoamerica, ranging in time from the Formative to the Postclassic periods.</page><page sequence="11">Stone sculpture of ancient West Mexico 191 misfortune. The images are carved out of solidified volcanic ash, or sometimes out of wood, and in rare instances they are molded from clay. (p. 24) The figures described by Lumholtz are relatively small and depict human or animal images crudely carved in volcanic rock. The sculptures were held in awe by the people not so much for their appearance as for the religious myths and traditions woven around them. In some cases these figures seem to be the pos sessors either of real mana or of some sort of superhuman power. In some instances, small pebbles of curious shapes and colors represented gods and were kept carefully wrapped in rags in god houses. Rock crystals, also held in high esteem by the Huichol, were thought to represent deities or ancestors (Lum holtz 1900:63). Few recognizable Mesoamerican deities can be identified in West Mexican stone sculpture. The small scale and relative sim plicity of these sculptures suggest their use in village-centered or domestic cults, rather than in public worship of the kind ded icated to the major deities in the larger urban centers of nuclear Mesoamerica. A possible interpretation for the present sculptural corpus is that some of these figures may represent tribal ancestors. An cestor worship was no doubt highly developed in ancient West Mexico, to judge by the widespread use of elaborate shaft tombs and the highly elaborate funerary furnishings usually found in them. This idea is also backed by ethnographic data. Among the Cora Indians, the dead attained an exalted position, being closely related to the stars. Their most important activ ity was to bring rain (Preuss 1912:26). To the Cora, the dead be came "the elders," or deities, who were present in the whole world, but especially in the night sky (Preuss 1912:145). The Huichol refer to deities as "grandfather" or as "grandmother," and the use of these familial terms suggests that at least some of the Huichol deities either represent ancestors that have been elevated to the rank of gods, or conversely, represent mythical beings that serve as tribal forebears who give a sense of social cohesion and identity to community members. The Huichol re gard even small rock crystals as ancestors and give them names, such as tevali, or "grandfather." This practice reflects an animistic philosophy in which all things have a soul, or a vital energy (Lumholtz 1900:63). Stone sculptures then may be seen in ancient West Mexico as representations of gods who were in effect the mythical fore bears of the social group. These ancestor-deities may have been important to the group's survival, for example by granting rain, the single most important element for Mesoamerican farmers. In this the ancient West Mexicans probably did not differ much from the present-day Huichol, whose life is a constant prayer for rain and for the protection of the deities. RESUMEN El análisis iconográfico de la escultura prehispánica en piedra del Oc cidente de México (Jalisco, Colima, Nayarit y Michoacán) ha des cubierto varios temas iconográficos, los cuales se interpretan utilizando la analogía etnográfica con los indígenas huicholes y otros grupos, así como con datos etnohistóricos del Occidente y centro de México y otras áreas. Un total de siete temas iconográficos se han identificado: (1) Cabezas humanas; (2) Cráneos humanos; (3) Figuras dobles; (4) Figuras antropo-zoomorfas; (5) Braceros antropomorfos; (6) Figuras con cuernos; (7) Jorobados. Un significado que se identifica en mayor o menor grado en la mayoría de los temas iconográficos es el de la fer tilidad. Se discuten brevemente los problemas relacionados con la utilización de datos etnográficos en la interpretación del simbolismo pre hispánico, y se presentan datos de fuentes documentales tempranas que mencionan el uso dado a las figuras de piedra dentro de la religión y rit ual indígenas del Occidente de México durante la época posterior a la Conquista. Finalmente, se propone que estas esculturas eran objetos sagrados, cuya posible función era la de simbolizar a los ancestros deificados o a deidades que tenían como responsabilidad el dar la llu via y la fertilidad.
