<plain_text><page sequence="1">"He who sits in the heavens laughs" : Recovenng Animal Theology in the Abrahamic Traditions* Kimberley C. Patton Harvard Divinity School When I wandered into the "vast ocean of the Talmud" a decade or so ago, unaware of the warning within the same texts that Gentiles who undertake the study of Jewish sacred literature should be put to death, I finally found what I had been seeking for years. Here at last was a glimpse of God' s personality His likes and dislikes, His idiosyncracies, His religious observances. To my delight, I also dis- covered in the tractate 'Abodah Zarah the answer to another mystery. What does God do all day? 'Abodah Zarah offers the divine schedule in the course of a discussion about whether and when God laughs. Psalm 2:4 announces: "He who sits in the heavens laughs." Remarking on this verse in the name of Rab, Rab Judah suggests that as well as laughing in the future at the hypocritical proselytes on the messianic day of the great battle with the assemblies of Gog and Magog, the Lord also laughs on every ordinary day: The day consists of twelve hours; during the first three hours the Holy One, blessed be He, is occupying Himself with the Torah; during the second three He sits in judgement on the whole world, and when He sees that the world is so guilty as to deserve destruction, He transfers For their inspired assistance with this project, I offer my heartfelt gratitude to Ronald Thiemann, William Graham, Menachem Fisch, Alon Goshen-Gottstein, Donald Griffin, Paul Waldau, Margo McLoughlin, Deacon Seraphim Solof, Jon Levenson, and Bruce Beck. Special thanks to Father Thomas Hopko for its original spark in "the rabbithood of God." I hope it will not dishonor them; the errors are all mine.

I am always transfixed by the image of the Creator of the Universe unwinding at the end of the day by seeking out the only creature big enough to play with Himne of hattannlnlm haggedollm, "the great sea monsters" who are not pri- mordial like their antecedents in Mesopotamian myth but instead were divinely created on the fifth day.2 The sheer exuberance of the idea can perhaps be sensed in the glittering breach of a humpback whale, the flight of an orca into the sky from the sea, or the racing dance of bottle-nosed dolphins as they crisscross the prow of a boat for miles. Its theological power dwells in the idea of a distinctive and intimate relationship between the Creator and His creatures both the "natu- ral" and the "fantastic" ones a bond that transcends affection and seems, rather, to enter into-the realm of ecstatic symbiosis. Although this interlocking relationship, appearing as it does repeatedly in the history of world religions, can and often is mediated by human beings, it just as often is not. When it is not, and when animals are construed as theological subjects lb. 'Abod. Zar. 3b (Hebrew-English Edition of the Babylonian Talmud; trans. A. Mishcon; ed. I. Epstein; London: The Soncino Press, 1988). A challenge to this by Rabbi Nahman ben Isaac goes unresolved; instead, Isa 42:14 becomes a proof text for God's refusal to laugh at any time after the destruction of the Temple: "I have long held my peace, I have been still, and refrained myself, now will I cry." The upshot is that God now spends the fourth quarter of his day instructing small children (according to Rashi, those who have died very young), presum- ably in Torah. At night, as the rabbinical discussion yields, God either continues his daytime activities, or else rides on a cherub and floats in 18,000 worlds, or else sits and listens to the songs of the hayyot, the winged angelic beings who bear his throne. 2As Genesis emphatically tells us and Jon Levenson has illumined. See Jon Levenson, Creation and the Persistence of Evil: The Jewish Drama of Divine Omnipotence (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1988) 53-54. Levenson observes, "the great aquatic beast is not merely captured and subjugated . . . but actually fashioned by YHWH from the start and only for the purpose of his personal diversion and amusement.... Leviathan in Psalm 104 is just another of the myriad things whose existence prompts the psalmist to an ecstatic proclamation of the wisdom that God manifested when he filled the world with creatures of his own design." The term tannln elsewhere is used to refer to Leviathan, as in Job 41:1. Whereas Levenson's emphasis here is on the subordination of the oceanic monsters to God, as well as on their dependent origination, we should not overlook the joy that results from their creation: appar- ently, a mutual joy, flowing like a parabola between Creator and creature, infinite owner and oversized pet a joy rolling like mighty intercontinental splashes between them during the fourth quarter of each day.</page><page sequence="3">KIMBERLEY PATTON 403 rather than as mediated objects,3 comparative theological analysis must then begin to generate new descriptive paradigms in ways that are not only specific to the tradition in question, but are also at least on some level intelligible to it.4 This should not be an enquiry undertaken out of or driven by an animal rights agenda, for time and again ancient religious systems refuse to conform themselves to modern ideological biases. For example, close examination of most systems of sacrificial thought often reveals not only an intense bond between sacrificer and victim, but also-and even more counterintuitively from a rationalist standpoint a kind of sublimation of the animal, even resulting in its apotheosis. To dismiss this process by waving the apotropaic wand of our age, the label of "oppression," or to treat it as elaborate social pretext for the deployment of collective values, as Hubert and Mauss did in their rightly celebrated but largely uncriticized study a century ago, is to preclude any deeper comprehension of the religious role of animals in such systems.S We must be less certain: wise as serpents, innocent as doves, and above all humble before beliefs much older and far more psychologically and mythopoetically com- plex than our own self-righteous and often sterile postmodern platforms. For any tradition, one might ask instead: what is the nature of the relationship between the divine and animal realms? How is that relationship semiotically expressed? What does the relationship reveal about the structure of the metaphysi- 3I am indebted to the theologian Thomas Berry for his often repeated observation that "the world is a communion of subjects, not a collection of objects" (see, for example, his Prologue in A Communion of Subjects: Animals in Religion, Science, and Ethics, ed. Paul Waldau and Kimberley Patton [forthcoming]). 4This methodological criterion was articulated most decisively by Wilfred Cantwell Smith in his essay, "Comparative Religion: Whither and Why?," in The History of Religions: Essay in Methodology, ed. Mircea Eliade and Joseph Kitagawa (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1959) 31-58. Discussion within the comparative discipline in the subsequent decades has, to some extent, nuanced Smith's "litmus test" in less absolute terms; see, for example, the discussions of Diana Eck or William Paden on the special interpretive value of the etic or synthetic perspective that could not have risen from within the tradition but is nevertheless still recognizable to it in A Magic Still Dwells: Comparative Religion in the Postmodern Age, ed.

Halls (1898; reprinted Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1964) 29-138. Outside the scope of this discussion are both the issue of vegetarianism and the special case of sacrifice, whereby the animal victim belongs to and represents the gods. However, it is worth noting that the monotheistic traditions mirror polytheistic ones in their view of the special consecrated status of the victim, whether animal or human, and whether the sacrifice is a blood-offering or has been sublimated, as in the case of the Eucharist. As Hubert and Mauss (Sacrifice, 79) note, "Sacrifice effects an exaltation of victims, which renders them directly divine." This state- ment must be inflected for each tradition; in ancient Israelite sacrifice the victim is not so much "directly divine" as it is holy, set apart, consecrated; once vowed, it cannot be redeemed or returned to the pen (see Lev 27:9-13 and tractates Temura of the Mishnah and Tosefta).</page><page sequence="4">404 HARVARD THEOLOG ICAL REVI EW cal world and its corollary manifestation in the physical one? What is its sacred history? What is its ontological structure? What are its theological implications: what does it purport to reveal about the nature of the ultimate? In light of "animal theol- ogy," how does religious efE1cacy play itself out? What kinds of moral, magical, or social status does it attribute to real animals? Or rather, to adapt the famous saying of Levi-Strauss, how are animals "good to think" about God?6 The lens of this topic has classically afforded a rather narrow range of categories among histories of world religions, and the result is equally theologically constric- tive. With any number of variations, the schema tends to go as follows: There are the indigenous traditions, such as those of the Alaskan Yup'ik or the Kuranko of Sierra Leone, wherein the most potent metaphysical forces are indeed animal pow- ers whose domain encompasses both human beings and living animals "on the ground." These are traditions of shamanic theurgy, healing rituals, and human/ani- mal metamorphosis. They represent, so the argument goes, living vestiges of ancient hunting societies: the theological "childhood" of humanity, whose religious imagi- nation, constained thoroughly as it was by the exigencies of survival, could do no more than play itself out in the dream-like terms of a hypostasized animal world.7 Then there are the classical, ulrbanized waditions such as those of the ancient Egyp- tian or Mayan, which represent the next stage of theological "development": hierarchically arranged divine theriomorphy. The gods can assume animal form or have animal bodies; and correspondingly, real animals, such as the Egyptian cat or the Mayan rabbit, can be divinized. Further along the "spectum" lie polytheistic or kathenotheistic traditions such as the ancient Greek wherein the pantheon becomes increasingly anthropomorphic as it develops chronologically, with the gods having fewer animal attibutes or the society elevating fewer sacred animals. These devel- opments are interpreted as signs of increasing theological sophistication. 6Levi-Strauss's famous statement came in the context of his Totemism, wherein he argued for a radical shift in the evaluation of the role of animals in the signification of kinship groups, that is, as emblems of structural opposition that are neither understood as "natural stimulus" nor reductively as "arbitrary pretext": "The animals in totemism cease to be solely or princi- pally creatures which are feared, admired, or envied: their perceptible reality permits the embodiment of ideas and relations conceived by speculative thought on the basis of empirical observations. We can understand, too, that natural species are chosen not because they are 'good to eat' but because they are 'good to think."' Claude Levi-Strauss, Totemism, trans. Rodney Needham (Boston: Beacon Press, 1963) 89. 7A typical example of this approach is Francis Klingender, Animals in Art and Thought to the End of the Middle Ages (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1971). In his chapter on "The Hunter's Art and Mythology," Klingender writes the following: ". . . the emphasis Miss Rachel Levy places on the concept of 'participation' in her profound analysis of the Paleolithic ritual seems unduly spiritual. That the hunters' attitude to their game may be expressed in terms of partici- pation I am prepared to admit, but only on the level on which children conceive that term, when, for example, they 'embody' an admired creature's strength and virtues in themselves eating it" (p. 27).</page><page sequence="5">KIMBERLEY PATTON 405 Uncomfortably for developmentalist schemata, however, in some highly philo- sophically sophisticated polytheistic systems such as Hinduism, divine animal attributes, animal-headed gods, and sacred animals "on the ground" remain highly prominent in iconography and in the epic imagination as well as often in quotidian ritual. In their various recombinations of the doctrine of samsara, originally South Asian traditions add a special dimension to the divine-human-animal hierarchy: through karmic dictate the human being can face an animal rebirth; indeed, as the Jatakamalas narrate, even the Buddha himself experienced prior animal lives. At the "end" or apex of this developmentalist spectrum, it is argued, lie the mono- theistic or Abrahamic traditions, wherein, with the special exception of the Christian doctrine of the Incarnation, the ineffable and aniconic transcendent takes neither immanent human nor animal form, but instead invests itself in elaborate historical and moral transactions with persons-indeed, with chosen communities. In these three revealed religions, so goes the analysis, the place of real animals is clear. They are "animated things" whose ancestors were made during the first week of the world. Whereas in Genesis 1, the creation of the "swarms of living creatures" from the waters, the winged birds "to fly above the earth across the dome of the sky," and the animals of the earth "of every kind" precedes the creation of humankind in God's image on the sixth day, the sun does not set on that day before He has also given dominion over these new nations to the first man and first woman (Gen 1:2s31). The Quran reiterates this perspective: "It is He Who hath created for you / All things that are on earth . . ." (S 2:29).8 In the chronology of Genesis 2, the animals were neither created prior to Adam and Eve nor, apparently, were they even planned by God; they were unsuccessful divine attempts at providing "helpers" to Adam, pro- spective partners whom the first man is charged with naming in the process: "The Lord God said, 'It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper as his partner.' So out of the ground the Lord God formed every animal of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the Eleld; but for the man there was not found a helper for his partner" (Gen 2:18- 20).9 This, in turn, provokes the ultimately successful attempt to alleviate the Elrst loneliness, God's fashioning of Woman from the nb of the deeply slumbering Man. 8The English interpretation of the Quran used throughout is that of 'Abdullah Yusuf 'Ali, The Meaning of the Holy Qur'dn (Brentwood: Amana Corporation, 1991). For an insightful discussion of the implications of such Quranic passages as they are debated in a tenth-century Muslim fable, The Case of the Animals versus Man before the King of the Jinn of the Ikhwan al-$afa', see Zayn Kassam, "The Book of the Animals of the Brethren of Purity: Towards an Ecology of Being," forthcoming in Waldau and Patton, ed., A Communion of Subjects. 9The English translation of the Hebrew Bible and New Testament used throughout is that of The New Oxford Annotated Bible (NRSV; ed. Bruce M. Metzger and Roland E. Murphy [New York: Oxford University Press, 1994]).</page><page sequence="6">406 HARVARDTHEOLOGICAL REVIEW In the monotheistic cosmos, then, there is apparently nothing about animals that is theologically unaffected by scriptural anthropology. The creation accounts or Quranic cosmology seem to depict God's orientation toward them as muted or secondary because it is so strongly mediated by His passionate interest in the up- right creatures that He fashions to resemble Himself. The nature-or even the possibilityf animal orientation toward God remains, or so it would seem, highly underdetermined. Whether or not the sacred histories yield a world that was "cre- ated for man," there can be no question that Adam and Eve are the telos of the primordial birthing, its supreme triumph, its flower; animals are auxiliary players at best. In the drama that immediately unfolds in the Garden, human beings are God's main moral interest; animals are not. The serpent is divinely cursed first for his role in the Fall, but the horror of the choice made at the tree will play itself out in the far more complex destiny of the mortal pair. It is in that destiny, that human history in all its existential dimensions, that God will so intensely and tragically involve Himself. Historians of world religion are often not gifted theologians, and the reverse is also often true: by training, theologians are usually exclusively situated in only one or at best two religious traditions and are often nonconversant with global religious history, fearing charges of perennialism, universalism, and their ilk. As the scholarship of animal rights grows, the predictable complaint that the mono- theistic traditions are anthropocentric, that is, that they consistently place human beings at the center of the matrix of meaning, with animals below or on the periph- ery, can apparently find support in the thought of any number of classical thinkers from these traditions. In fact, the charge of Abrahamic anthropocentricity is as distorting as it is distressingly common. However, it quite often derives from a social construction of religious narrative; in other words, animal rights-oriented scholars tend to ignore the character of God in monotheistic traditions as so much apologetic drapery for chronic human narcissism and eco-exploitation. To take only one example from his complex range of writings on the subject, there is Thomas Aquinas's defense of the killing of animals in the Summa Theologica: ". . . the Divine Ordinance of animals and plants is preserved not for themselves but for man . . . as Augustine says . . . both their life and death are subject to our use.''l° This passage is often cited as a kind of proof-text for a Chris- tian hierarchical model whereby animals are assigned their place in the cosmos as resources and objects rather than as theological subjects. In dwelling on the sec- ond half of Aquinas's assertion in its apparent utilitarian cosmology, however, it is easy to overlook the burden of the first. It is God who orders the schema that gives dominion ("benign or just sovereignty," as Bernhard Anderson suggests; compare l°Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica, Question 64, Article 1. English text by the English Dominican Fathers (New York: Benzinger Brothers, 1918).</page><page sequence="7">K I M B ER LEY PATTO N 407 Isa 11:S8) to humanity over the animals. Yet, as sung by Psalm 145:9, and so often quoted by the rabbis, "His tender mercies are over all his works." God re- mains eternally invested in the well-being of all His creatures. In sum, it is not that animals are not infinitely precious to God or that they are not a source of great interest to Him. It is that human beings are, agonizingly, of infinitely more value and interest: "Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten in God's sight" (Luke 12:6). "But even the hairs of your head are counted. Do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows" (Luke 12:7). A traditional monotheistic schema does not theologically denigrate animals. Rather, it elevates human beings andframes their moral choices as being of ultimate importance. This is an entirely different matter, allowing us to think more openly about the orthodox parameters of animal theology rather than forcing us to generate new, anti-hierarchical schemata that are doctrinally unintel- ligible. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all insist on the ontological and moral gulf between humans and animals. This is why animal rights rhetoric often does not reach or affect traditional monotheistic religious agendas, standing as it does, as David Carlin points out, in the "long tradition of trying to narrow the gap between humans and lower animals." Carlin attributes the motive behind this move to "a strong animosity toward the view of human nature taken both by biblical religions and by the great classical schools of philosophy.... To reduce human nature to nothing more than its biological status is to attack this ancient and exalted concep- tion of human nature.''ll There can be no question that classical monotheistic theologies grow out of hierarchical valuation: in keeping with the Biblical account of creation of human beings in the divine selem or the Quranic vision of the investiture of the divine ru h into the pre-human clay, they are infinitely more valuable than animals, just as is true in the Buddhist or Jain systems of thought. There, however, driven by the metempsychotic principle, the valuation is for highly different reasons. I would suggest, nevertheless, that dwelling simplistically on the primacy of humanity over animals in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam is not heuristically useful in compre- hending these traditions with respect to the theological status of animals.l2 The Abrahamic traditions are not classically "anthropocentric" in the sense that they are so often indicted. Instead, they are theocentric, that is, they place God, not humanity-the God of Abraham and Sarah and Hagar, the God who created the Earth, who gave the Law, and who then spoke in history through His prophets; God, the uncreated light, the source of all being-at the center of their cosmologi- "David R.

All other forms of meaning derive from this ultimate source, de- spite the deep tensions that arise as a result, including the rationalism of the rabbinical schools that goes so far as to tell God that the Torah is no longer His to interpret.13 Thus we are poorly served by a chart that places God at the top, humanity at the next level down, and animals at the bottom, with the directionality of devotion, litur- gical praxis, communication and ultimately of relationship charted only between those levels. Instead I believe that a closer examination of the sacred literatures of these traditions, including scriptural, commentarial, and mystical writings, yields a different and rather arresting theological proposition. Both as species and as individuals, animals have their own special, consecrated, differentiated and highly charged relationship to God. That is, even when the moral predicament of human beings is the focus of a given narrative, the divine/animal relationship is not always humanly mediated. Nor, as has been argued, can we con- strue animals that appear in monotheistic religious narratives or in sacred images solely as didactic vehicles.l4 Furthermore, it is not a relationship that can be senti- mentally dismissed. Animals are religious in ways that sometimes echo human religiosity but, often as not, are idiosyncratic to their own species. Aaggadah, hagiography, and hadith offer the most fertile soil for this admittedly occult theo- logical theme. But it is by no means absent from Tanakh, from New Testament, or from Quran, and it cannot easily be attributed to vestigial totemisms. Thus developmentalist histories, with their implicit use of the religious importance of ani- mals as a kind of index of theological sophistication, can and should be challenged. The Oxford theologian Andrew Linzey, a radical scriptural literalist, takes the defensible Christian concept of a relationship between creature and creator that can be thought about separately from its purely human dimensions. From this point he extrapolates an impassioned Christian theology of animal rights.15 That is not my project here. Nor will I deal with issues of ethical application; these have been and no doubt will continue to be amply aired.l6 Instead I want to lift up this underdetemined relationship and to ask what new light it sheds on both parties God and animals and briefly to sketch three aspects of the relationship that are present in any number of religious traditions, but perhaps most unexpectedly in the three monotheistic ones.

Andrew Linzey and Dorothy Yamamoto (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1998).</page><page sequence="9">KIMBERLEY PATTON 409 These aspects are: first, divine compassion or special regard for animals; sec- ond, communication and mutual awareness between God and animals; and third, animal veneration of God, particularly in its ritual dimensions. I will then discuss the theological implications of the current research in the field of zoology on the topic of "animal consciousness" (as distinguished from "animal cognition"), as well as the issue of "anthropomorphism" as it dually obtains in the religious imagi- nation and in our imagination of animals. Here, in the principle of theomorphic resemblance, I suggest another way to construe the similarities to human nature apparently manifested both by God and by animals. Finally, I will offer what I believe may be a useful hermeneutical concept in discerning what lies at the heart of God's sanctified and charged relationship to animals: why He created Levia- than in the first place, and why "the Holy One, blessed be He," laughed as He played during those long golden afternoons with His huge friend whose "sneezes flash forth like light, and [whose] eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn" (Job 41: 1 8).17 This is the idea of divine ipseity, namely, the inexhaustible and reflexive creativity of God, His self-origination, self-sufficiency, and self-referentiality as expressed through the myriad forms of his creation. It is a concept that, although refracted in ways that are highly theologically inflected for each of the traditions in question, is both foundational and consistently generative for all three. I offer these reflections as an effort that must inevitably fall between the inter- stices of the comparative study of religion and the project of constructive theology. In a sense, I understand it as a kind of "archaeological theology," an effort to restore to our attention historical themes that have been not so much lost as they have been ignored, trivialized, or most recently, polemicized. Their restoration does far more than redirect our attention to animals as theological subjects. Instead it enriches our image and experience of God in a way that might embolden rather than undermine orthodox interpretations of these materials. a Divine Compassion and Special Regard for Animals It is not surprising that human beings are so special to God. In all three Abrahamic traditions, human beings alone are created in God's image. This is clear in Genesis (Gen 1:1-2:3). It is clear in Patristic, particularly in Athanasian, Christology, especially as it treats the redemption of the Fall through the Incarnation. It is clear in the theological synthesis of Abu Hamid al-Ghazall, which took as its starting point the uniqueness of Adam as God's own creation from clay, imbued with His spirit (S 38:71-72).18 Like human beings, animals are also God's inventions, partici- "Tanakh Job 41: 10. '8Al-Ghazali's distinction of human beings from among other creatures and everything else in the world thus separated him, ideologically, from the strictest construction of tanzih, or the prohibition against anthropomorphism in theology. God is not utterly removed from</page><page sequence="10">410 HARVARD THEOLOG ICAL REVI EW pating in the self-emptying of the divine nature as creative expressions of that mighty will and energy. God alone subsists in Himself, while "things through their own essence have nothing but non-existence, and existence comes to them only from something else, by way of a loan. But the existence of Allah is essential, unborrowed. This reality of self-subsistence belongs to Allah alone.''l9 Thus despite their highly different moral stature and metaphysical potential, Adam and Eve share dependent origination with leopards and egrets. The diverse streams of Judaism, (Shristianity, and Islam all indicate that once established by creation, God's relationship with animals does not stop then, but rather continues in an ongoing, vital way.20 Although the inhabitants of Nineveh dwell outside the Mosaic covenant, it is not surprising that God upbraids Jonah with His concern for the people of "that great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons who do not know their right hand from their left...." (Jon 4:9). It is surprising when God adds, "and also many animals!" But these are the animals who, only hours before, fasted and put on sackcloth alongside their human owners in penitence before the God of Israel. It is not surprising that in the synoptic Gospels, Jesus iterates divine concern for the individual human being, even to the point of numbering the hairs on his or her head; it is surprising that He does so, as we have noted, by first iterating God's awareness of the fall of a single sparrow an individual (Matt 10:29). It is not surprising that through the revelation of the Quran to the Prophet, God expresses His love for His people. It is surprising that Surah 6:38 extends human religious organi- zational categories to the animal world: "There is not an animal (that lives) on the earth, nor a being that flies on its wings, but (forms part of) communities (ummam) like you." A hadith qudsl reported by Abu Hurayrah reveals the radical sense of the association with His creatures; through Adam we can discern a likeness between the human spirit and that of God in its essence, quality, and action. Just as Allah rules the world, so a person analogously rules his or her body. However, in the Madnun al-.saghlr, al-Ghazall makes it clear that one can avoid the danger of anthropomorphic theology-of tashblh since Adam is not self-sufficient. God alone, unlike Adam, is gayyum ("self-subsisting"). l9D. B. MacDonald, "Allah," in The Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam, ed. H. A. R. Gibb and J. H. Kramers (Leiden: Brill, 1974) 41. 20This sometimes surfaces in poignant ways. That the creation stories of Genesis could be understood as implying direct divine paternity of the animal kingdom is clear enough in the cry of the cock in the medieval work of Jewish fiction written by Kalonymous ben Kalonymous in 1316, Iggeret Baalei Hayyim: At midnight I rise to pray But the sleeping ones lay hold of me . . . They slaughter me and eat me. Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us all?" Note that the cock rises not simply characteristically to cry out, but to pray.</page><page sequence="11">KIMBERLEY PATTON 411 word "communities": The Prophet told of ie stinging of another prophet in ie past by an ant; in anger, he ordered ie whole of the ants' nest to be burned. God repri- manded him: "Because one ant stung you, you have burned a whole community which glorified me.''2l The groups in which animals, birds, and insects are consti- tuted are themselves worshipping communities, in some sense analogous to human ummam, insofar as their collective well-being matters to God. Ants and other crea- tures emerge as groups in their own right, worthy of divine regard. As al-Hafiz Masri points out, this valuation seems to exist "not in relation to human species or its values," including the human criteria of insignificance or dangerousness.22 Further- more, God did not Emd it just that the action of one individual ant should catalyze destruction for its entire ummah of ants. In Judaism, the ancient principle of sdf ar bdf ale haylm, of refraining from harm to living things, safeguards individual animals in predictable ways, as for example, when in both the Sefer ha-Mitzvot and the Mishneh Torah, Maimonides summa- rizes rabbinical legislation requiring the unloading of a beast that struggles under an overtaxing load.23 But the theme also startlingly breaks forth in the direction of theological subjectivity in the Talmudic account of the encounter of the great Judah ha-Nasi, redactor of the Mishnah (simply "Rabbi" in the tradition), with a calf on its way to kosher slaughter. "When it broke away, [it] hid his head under Rabbi's skirts, and lowed [in terror]." Unmoved by the little creature's plight, Judah ha-Nasi sent it away, saying, "Go, for this you were created." The Gemara tells us that the angels heard this: "Thereupon they said [in Heaven]: 'Since he has no pity, let us bring suffering upon him"' (Baba Mesi'a 85a). Judah ha-Nasi is then afflicted for thirteen years with excruciating bodily suf- fering. He is only freed when, as the account in Baba Mesi'a continues, "One day Rabbi's maidservant was sweeping the house; [seeing] some young weasels there, she made to sweep them away. 'Let them be,' he said to her; 'It is written, and his tender mercies are over all his works.' Said they [in Heaven], 'Since he is compas- sionate, let us be compassionate to him."' The calf is bolting from its assigned social role, namely that of being killed in a kosher manner to be eaten. This is what lies behind Rabbi's heartless statement to the calf: "Go, for this you were created." Yet in the calfss transgressive act of 2lBukhari 5:153.

Judah ha-Nasi here is called upon to make the choice made by God Him- self in Berakot 7a, where He prays that his mercy might overcome His justice and all His other attributes. Instead Rabbi allows religiously determinative justifica- tion ("the order of things" established in Genesis) to overrule compassion, and sends the little calf to its doom. On behalf of the calf: heaven exacts revenge. Through years of chronic illness and suffering Judah ha-Nasi is cruelly, one might say even disproportionately, punished by the angels. Nothing can redeem him except a later act of compassion toward animals and, unlike the edible calf but like the stinging ant of the hadffth qudsl, socially useless ones at that!24 One notes not only the symmetry of the pun- ishment and its amelioration cruelty to one animal must be balanced by kindness to another animal but the degree of keen ethical attention accorded to this situa- tion by heaven. In the end, Judah ha-Nasi suffers because he apparently failed to act as God would have. Psalm 145:9 first condemns him in his pitilessness and then vindicates him in his tasuba with respect to the weasels. In this story, God's creatures are established as autonomous entities rather than merely as emblematic members of their species. The calf is, suIprisingly, an individual with whom God has a real and religiously defined relationship. In God's eyes both, calf and wea- sels have standing, have worth, can petition; above all, they can attract God's protection and his mercy.25 In the theomimetic heart of the mystic as it is alchemically refined in holy fire, human compassion, of necessity, imitates that of the Creator. It overflows cov- 24See Schochet's discussion of this story in Animal Life in Jewish Tradition, 164-65. Here Schochet's rationalist framework clearly becomes for him an exegetical impediment: ". . . the narrative is a troubling one. Is there any justification in concluding from it that one has a moral obligation to rescue any animal designated for slaughter? After all, is it not permissible to eat the meat of kosher animals which are properly slaughtered? Or is it, ideally? Why then should Rabbi Judah be condemned from heaven for not interfering with what is a legitimate under- taking[?]. Yet he is condemned. He is clearly judged guilty of having shown no pity toward the frightened calf, and is severely punished for failing to emulate Him whose 'tender mercies are over all His works."' 25In the Zohar, God is furious with Noah when he emerges from the ark and asks why all the world had to be destroyed. God rebukes him for being so passive and for not pleading for mercy for the rest of creation at the time he was commanded to build, but only selfishly saving his family and the designated creatures as he was commanded and then despairing after the fact. The Zohar implies that had Noah pleaded for mercy before the catastrophic rains, God would have spared the world from the flood (Zohar Hadash 22 c-d and 23a, extrapolating, as Daniel Matt shows in his commentary, from Debarim Rabbah and Isa 54:9 [where the flood is called "the waters of Noah"]).

It naturally encompasses not only suffering humanity but all of God's creatures, even the undesirable, the lost and fallen, the evil. This was surely the vision of Isaac the Syrian, bishop of Nineveh, who in the eighth century wrote the following: An elder was once asked, "What is a compassionate heart?" He replied: "It is a heart on fire for the whole of creation, for humanity, for the birds, for the animals, for demons and all that exists. At the recollection and at the sight of them such a person's eyes overRow with tears owing to the vehemence of the compassion which grips his heart; as a result of his deep mercy his heart shrinks and cannot bear to look on any injury or the slightest suffering of anything in creation. This is why he constantly offers up prayer full of tears, even for the irrational animals and for the enemies of truth, even for those who harm him, so that they may be protected and find mercy. He even prays for the reptiles as a result of the great compassion which is poured out beyond measure after the likeness of God in his heart."26 Nothing that he has made escapes his regard. As God's tender mercy is over all His works, so might the human heart made in His image also burn "for the whole of creation," even for the reptiles. In imitating Him, the scope of our prayer widens beyond imaginable limits, for He is inescapably everywhere, and ". . . Everything (that exists) will perish except His own Face."27 Animal Awareness of and Communication with God In his research on the antiquity of raven oracles throughout the transpacific, Eric Mortensen traces ie idea from the Naxi of Tibet to Aiapaskan-speaking Nori American peoples.28 Observing the ways in which ravens and crows are cast as oracles, even in historically unrelated religious traditions, Mortensen asks wheier ie noise iat corvids make is transculturally interpreted as oracular because it sounds so much like human cries, and ominous ones at thatne thinks of the heraldic crows in Black Elk's great vision: "It is time! It is time! It is time!" An alternative explanation would be that ravens and crows have a comprehension of and mandate to reveal- supernatural destiny or will; in other words, that they are indeed oracular birds. On a phenomenological level, we might approach the question by looking at the ways in which animals are believed to possess a unique awareness of holiness, 26Mystic Treatises by Isaac of Nineveh, trans.

The animal is compelled to react to the presence of the other world. This poignant awareness, this gnosis, is part of a larger spectrum of special rapport. In many religious worlds, animals can and do communicate with the divine.29 A mutual intelligibilit obtains between God and animals that exists outside of human perceptual ranges: "And the Lord taught [Awh] the Bee to build its cells in hills, on trees, and in (men's) habitations . . . (S 16:68)."3° In monotheistic traditions, this rapport frequently serves apologetic ends, as sole witness or coIToborating testimony to revelation.3' The animals of religious narrative and poetry are often aware of supernatural phenomena unseen by human beings. On the road to Israel, Balaam's she-ass sees the Lord's angel, sword drawn, standing directly in her path. The angel is invisible to Balaam, a Mesopotamian diviner on his way to aid Balak the Moabite king; the donkey desperately tries three times to avoid the menacing being (Num 22:23-27). When in his physical and spiritual blindness Balaam strikes the don- key, her mouth is opened, and she asks her owner only to consider whether she has ever behaved this way. The angel, for his part, sardonically informs Balaam that had he continued on his perverse mission, displeasing to the Lord of Israel, he would have killed him "and let it [the donkey] live." "Folklore" abounds with the persistent motif of the animal who, growling or rearing in fear, alone perceives the ghost, the demon, or the angel. Thus Bernhard Anderson predictably casts Num 22:21-35 as "a folk story, with its miraculous 29Animals prophesy because the other world speaks to them and is understood. In Medi- terranean and other mythologies, both indigenous or classical, gods consistently communicate with animals without the necessity of human interpretation; both parties usually know more than do people about what is "really" going on in a given course of events. The lliad gives us the magical talking horses of Achilles, Xanthos, and Balios, horses "stormy Podarge once conceived of the west wind" (11. 16.149-51). As they mourn the death of Patroklos and antici- pate that of Achilles, the horses lean their heads along the ground and weep "warm tears," soiling their bright manes. Powerless to forestall their loss, Zeus laments together with them: "Poor wretches, / why then did we ever give you to the Lord Peleus, / a mortal man, and you yourselves are immortal and ageless? / Only so that among unhappy men you also might be grieved? / Since among all creatures that breathe on earth and crawl on it / there is not anywhere a thing more dismal than man is" (11. 17.442 [trans. Richmond Lattimore; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951]). 30As Masri insists and 'All concedes, the verb here (wahyun) ordinarily has God as its subject, and means "to reveal, to inspire to put a special message into the human heart"; it is used of God's revelation to all His Prophets, including the Holy Prophet Muhammad. The interpretation "taught" is an attempt to soften the theological impact of God's mysterious communication with the bee, which takes the form of revelation (See discussion in Masri, Animals in Islam, 12; 'All, The Meaning of the Holy Qur'an, S 16:68, note 2097). 3lIn the Book of Jonah, for example, in order to accomplish his ends, God "commands" (manah) and is understood by the fish (Jon 1:17), the vine (Jon 4:6), and the worm and the wind that attack the vine (Jon 4:7 and 4:8). There are thematic parallels in the Islamic version of the career of Yunus.</page><page sequence="15">KIMBERLEY PATTON 415 talking animal and unsophisticated, humorous irony," and an interpolated one at that, "apparently another tradition."32 But if the theme by definition signals the genre of folklore, rather than that of sacred history, then should we similarly dis- miss a congruent haCth account? One night a frightened animal tried to bolt from the courtyard as its owner, a companion of the Prophet, was reciting a qur'an. Muhammad tells his puzzled friend what happened: "That was the divine presence [al-sahnah, cognate with the Hebrew Shekhinah] that descended with the recita- tion."33 The animal senses the divine epiphany, which the owner fails to notice just as the she-ass alone saw and responded to God's angel, who was entirely imper- ceptible to her owner. For the "talking" feature of the tale of Balaam's ass to catapult it into "folklore" seems an arbitrary classificatory move at best; if in the hadSth, rather than running before the descending sa1dnah, the companion's animal had cried, "'Allahu akbar!", would that similarly have rendered the account "folkloric"? In both cases, it is the human owner who catalyzes the divine action: the angel comes to block Balaam, not his donkey; the sakmah is theurgically invoked by a human sacred recitation, not an animal prayer. And yet theologically, the mean- ings of the ancient Israelite and Muslim stories are comparable: animals can sometimes discern proximate supernatural presence where human beings cannot. Animals can manifest a special awareness of the holy, a sense of its "weirdness" and otherness. This human deficiency vis-a-vis the divine can be dangerous. As Abu Nu'aym and Bayhaql relate, camels and wild beasts prostrated them- selves before the Prophet; he was proclaimed as God's chosen messenger by gazelle, wolf, and lizard a green lizard, to be precise, who greeted him with "As-salam 'alaika ya nabl Muhammad, ya rasul Allah!"34 A spider protected Muhammad and 32Bernhard W.

Byzantine and medieval Christian hagiographies abound with tales of animals who, in instant discernment, recog- nize and humble themselves before holy men and women, such as the crocodiles who habitually ferried St. Pachomius, Abbot of Tabenenne, whenever he had to cross a river, gently depositing him wherever he wished,35 or the grateful hyena whom St. Macarius persuades to give up killing for food: "The old man perceived in his heart that it was the purpose of God who gives understanding to the beasts for a reproach unto ourselves, and he gave glory to God who gives understanding unto the beasts...."36 Animal relationships with saints can become lifelong para- digms of devotional symbiosis, such as that between St. Gerasimos and his lion, Jordanes. To some extent, the Eastern Orthodox iconographic convention that invariably portrays them together makes the animal a kind of signifying attribute or "familiar" of the saint, like the lion vehicle of the Hindu Durga, the mouse of Ganesa, or the nine-headed serpent Sesa on which Vi$nu sleeps on the ocean, awaiting the next creative revolution of time. On another level, however, the iconic animal is more than simply an objective correlative, a refracting mirror of the saint's glory. Rather it is itself a conscious, moral subject, standing in real and complex relationship both to the sanctified mortal companion and by implication, to the sanctifying Source. The depth of this triangular bond can be appreciated in the reciprocity with which "elected" animals are themselves treasured by the saints. In the hagiography of the Irish saint, Colman, one reads how a cock routinely awoke him for Lauds, a mouse each night gnawed at his clothes and nibbled his ear to "drag him from all quiet" to the divine office, and a fly would trot up and down his holy books, and, when he was interrupted, keep his place in the codex where he had been reading.37 "These whom nature has designed to the fret and annoyance of mankind, the amaz- ing kindness of God directed, against the weight of nature, to tendance upon his servants." When these three creatures died, the story tells of St. Colman's "heavy animal addresses appear as a kind of sign of the Prophet's barakah, and the cosmic nature of his election, as, for example, in the medieval Spanish-Arabic poet Ahmad al-'Arusi: "Is it not you who has been sent as mercy to mankind? / Is it not you whom the pebbles praised / And whom the lizard in the desert addressed, and the wolf too? / Is it not you for whom the full moon in the sky was split?"

St. Columba rather dispassionately responded "at once in jest and in wisdom, that 'there is neither lack nor loss where neither substance nor property is found': as though to question why a man of God, consecrated to supreme renun- ciation and to poverty, should set that heart on small things, which had renounced and spurned great things and high."38 Yet St. Colman's Vita, encompassing as it does the brief vitae of the three "small things," shows how great a chamber they occupied in the heart of the saint who cherished them. Xg Forms of Worship in the Animal World In the religious imagination, animals display a chronic and abiding impulse to glorify God. Even their most natural behaviors have been interpreted as ritualistic. Through such a lens, the world they inhabit thus appears as a kind of great liturgy of praise in which all have their role and station. As the Quran says, "Seest thou not that it is Allah Whose praises all beings in the heavens and on earth do cel- ebrate, and the birds (of the air) with wings outspread? Each one knows its own (mode of) prayer and praise. And Allah knows well all that they do" (S 24:41).39 Note that God's awareness of the doings of each animal is closely linked to its unique and appropriate mode of worship, "its own prayer." The Conference of the Birds, lEarld al-dln CAttar's great mystical poem of the twelfth century, tells the story of a congregation of birds who desperately desire to Elnd their King and who undertake a devastating pilgrimage to do so. Anthropomorphizing? Perhaps. Yet the poem's clearly allegorical dimensions cannot efface the ornithological particu- larity with which each bird pilgrim recites its spiritual dilemma and faces its destiny. Even more striking is the revelation at the end of the ordeal, where to the thirty enraptured birds who survive the journey through seven valleys (the SuEl Way, tanqah) God appears as a pure, lit mirror of their own souls. His name is Simorgh: in Persian, "thirty birds."40 The self, ultimately, is annihilated in God (fana), who 38Ibid., 130. 39It is interesting that here the Arabic adjective Saffat (ssspreading out [wingsJ") that describes al-tayr, "the birds," can carry with it the sense of "stretched out in rows," that is, in imitation of the prayer rows in which the salat is performed. The idea of birds praising God appears elsewhere in the Quran, for example, in SS 21:79; 34:10, and 38:18-19. Paret notes that in S 37:165-66, where the angels declare that "we are verily ranged in ranks [affl (for service); and we are verily those who declare (Allah's) glory!" saff stands in close relation to sabbaha, "to praise or magnify" (Rudi Paret, Der Koran. Kommentar und Konkordance [Stuttgart, 993] 414, 419). 40 Their souls rose free of all theytd been before; The past and its actions were no more. Their life came from that close, insistent sun And in its vivid rays they shone as one. There in the Simorgh's radiant face they saw</page><page sequence="18">418 HARVARD THEOLOG ICAL REVI EW was its light all along. The bird-self and its corollary, the God-bird, presents 'Attar with no conceptual hindrance; in fact, the pun almost certainly suggested the poem to him in the first place. Yet the Lord speaks to reassure the birds that there is nothing arbitrary about His name; it is, in the end, glitteringly reflexive. He is a true mirror: "If you had come as forty, fifty-here / An answering forty, fifty would appear . . . It is yourselves you see and what you are.''41 As the Philonic notion of the Image of God includes all of creation in its multi- plicity, so that in a sense God's totality comprises and requires each species He has made in order to be complete, so a kind of theological necessity attends the praise of God by eveiy creature. Each prayer is different, yet each prayer matters. Modern collections of poetry, like Carmen Bernos de Gasztold's Prayers from the Ark and The Creatures' Choir, refract this ancient idea. In the resulting poems, set on the ark as it floats, every animal addresses God in a manner that is both beautiful and inti- mate; every tone in the "choir" is utterly different from every other. The glowworm prays, "Dear God, / would You take Your light / a little farther away / from me? / I am like a morsel / of cinder / and need Your night / for my heart to dare / to flicker out its feeble star: / its hope, to give to other hearts, / what can be stolen from all poverty-/ a gleam of joy. Amen." But the giraffe has quite a different prayer: "Lord, / I who see the world from above / Elnd it hard to get used to its pettiness. / I have heard it said / You love humble creatures? / Chatter of apes ! / It is easier for me / to believe in Your geatness. / I feed on exalted things / and I rather like / to see myself so close to Your heaven. / Humility! / Chatter of apes! Amen."42 A medieval Jewish creatures' choir is part of the liturgical text Pereq Sirah (Hebrew: "chapter of song"), an anonymous work cited in the early tenth century CE in the work of a Jerusalem Karaite but almost certainly dating much earlier.43 Themselves, the Simorgh of the world with awe They gazed, and dared at last to comprehend They were the Simorgh and the journey's end. They see the Simorgh at themselves they stare, And see a second Simorgh standing there; They look at both and see the two are one; That this is that, that this, the goal is won.

Only man is absent. Apparently through the influence of the Safed kabbalists, the mystical Pereq Sirah, with its strong afElni- ties to Hekalot literature (such as Seder Rabbah de-Bereshit) and to "hymns of nature associated with apocalyptic visions and on the teaching of the ma'aseh bereshit"44 in both Talmuds, began to be recited as a prayer and was included in later siddurim.45 What is interesting in Pereq Sirah is the critical liturgical role played by animal participants in the hymnodic hierarchy. It has been suggested that the hymns of the animals, heavily biblically derivative, may represent a midrashic response to verse 4 of Psalm 151 (a relatively late, extracanonical psalm ascribed to David; the psalm is his song of victory after he has slain Goliath).46 The psalmist dwells on the impossibility of praising God, who has heard and known everything, rhetorically asking: For who can proclaim and who can bespeak and who can recount the deeds of the Lord? Everything has God seen Everything has he heard and he has heeded (Ps 151:4). One at a time the animals affirm that they can meet this challenge, that they can proclaim and bespeak and recount God's deeds and sing His praises; and one at a time they do, joining their voices with the angels and archangels who already sing out in Pereq girah. In other words, when the human voice of the psalm finds itself overwhelmed, unable to communicate God's greatness, the rest of creation imme- diately steps in to answer the failure and to perform the task of praising the Creator. Angels and animals, here functionally related in an extrahuman capacity, fill in the missing upper and lower registers of the universal symphony. In religious narratives from around the world, animals invest themselves in acts of devotion or penance; they often emerge as paradigms of piety who awe or shame their human counterparts. In the Judaic tradition, for example, one thinks of the pious donkey of Rabbi Pinehas ben Jair, who, when stolen by brigands, refuses to eat either in captivity or when sent home by them starving, because it was given 44See M. Beit-Arie, "Perek Shirah," Encyclopedia Judaica, col. 274. 45Ibid. 46The extracanonical psalm had been known only in Septuagint manuscripts of the Psalter such as codex Sainaiticus, codex Alexandrinus, etc. until Qumran Cave yielded a Hebrew Psalter, designated 1 lQPs&amp;, which included Pss 151, 154, and 155 (the latter two found only in a Syriac Psalter).

Animal ritual observance can seem supremely natural, calibrated to observed animal behavior, as in the case of the Muslim birds, mentioned earlier, who are said to pray because they stretch out their wings. They can also seem supremely unnatural or perhaps better, deliberately antinatural, as in the account of St. Colman's fly who stops crawling on cue to keep his place in the codex, or the vegetarianism of St. Macarius's beloved hyena. The animal overcomes its instinc- tive nature by way of signaling the greater power of a sacred modality. These can be understood as Abrahamic analogues to examples from the East such as the Jatakamalas, wherein the future Buddha is incarnated as a starving tiger who refrains from killing, or as a hare who keeps the Uposadha, the fast that begins on the fourteenth day of the month, exhorts his animal companions to do the same, and then flings himself into a fire to feed a starving Brahmin. Such accounts can also combine elements of "natural," "unnatural," and "antinatural" animal behav- iors,48 as in St. Bonaventure's tale of St. Francis and the birds: One time when Francis was walking with another friar in the Venetian marshes, they came upon a huge flock of birds, singing among the reeds. When he saw them, the saint said to his companion, "Our sisters 47Through its abstinence from food from which demai have not been separated, the donkey thus not only foils its captors (who cannot use a starved animal), but shames those who know of its strictness such as R. Jeremiah and R. Ze'ira, who inadvertently cause the consumption of untithed figs: "If the early [Rabbis] were angels, then we are humans; while if they were humans, we are asses. R. Mana observed: We are not even asses. R. Pinehas b. Jair's ass refused untithed barley which was offered to it, whereas we have eaten figs in an untithed state" (Gen. Rab. 60: 8). The abstinent donkey of Pinehas b. Jair also appears in b. Hullin 7a-b. 48I am grateful to Eleanor Mitten, Harvard Divinity School M.T.S. 2000, for drawing my attention to tales in Hindu bhakti devotionalism of what she calls "beasts as bhaktas." For example, we encounter the combination of natural, unnatural, and antinatural elements in the foundation legends of the temple of Kalahasti on the banks of the Mogileru river in Andhra Pradesh. In the Kalahastisvara Mahatmyamu, "Sacred Legends of the Lord of Kalahasti," a spider, snake, and elephant worship Aiva in ways that are highly idiosyncratic to their respec- tive species. When a lingam miraculously appears in the forest, the spider reverently decorates it with webs. Siva sets the webs on fire using the flame of a nearby lamp. The spider triumphs in the test, as it tries to consume the blaze. It is rewarded by the revelation of giva, who, in the words of English translator Heifetz Rao, "bestows upon him that permanent presence in the heaven of Shiva which is Saivite liberation." The snake and the elephant also adorn the lingam, but a peculiar rivalry develops. The snake, a cobra, places the jewels he has grown in his hood upon the lingam. The elephant, coming later, whisks these away with his trunk so that he can bathe the lingam by spraying it and then offering flowers and foliage. The snake, returning for its devotions, removes the flowers and replaces the gems. This cycle continues</page><page sequence="21">KIMBERLEY PATTON 421 the birds are praising their creator. We will go in among them and sing God's praise, chanting the divine office." They went in among the birds, which remained where they were, so that the friars could not hear them- selves singing the office, they were making so much noise. Eventually the saint turned to them and said, "My sisters, stop singing until we have given God the praise to which He has a right." The birds were silent immediately and remained that way until Francis gave them permission to sing again, after they had taken plenty of time to say the ofElce and had finished their praises. Then the birds began again, as usual.49 A reedy marsh is alive with a multitude of birds and their ecstatic song a supremely natural image. Francis construes the birds' singing as praise and actu- ally tries, with his companion friar, to join them as they praise God by chanting the office in the rushes. At the saint's advent, the birds do not startle and fly away but remain where they are, singing-a possible but highly unlikely response, at least if the saint were a normal human being; the account now heads into the realm of unnatural bird behavior. But when, rather than bliss in the combined choirs, the two holy men find instead cacophony-they cannot hear themselves think, let alone sing- the saint asks his sisters, the birds, to stop until the office is completed. The birds immediately comply and do not resume their own "praise" until the saint gives them permission. As a narrative and hagiographical device, this antinatural event bears witness to the God-given power of the saint, which can override the birds' God-given instincts to "praise without ceasing." fi Animals as Theological Subjects: The Challenge of Consciousness Even as the extension of the bird's wings signals "prayer," the problem remains of intentionality: does the bird choose to pray? This philosophical enigma is in turn closely embedded in larger questions of consciousness and free will. Perhaps because its golden vision of the world as a great liturgy in which even birds praise their Creator is so strongly scripturally developed, Islamic theology is also com- pelled strongly to insist-agreeing with received Jewish and Christian theological interpretation-that only human beings are granted the gift of free will. Thus although they diverge from one another on the subject of angelic free will, all three until both animals resolve to spy upon their respective rivals. A great conflict ensues. The snake crafi^ls into the elephant's trunk and "the elephant, crazed by the venom, smashes his head against a hill, killing both himself and the cobra." Mitten remarks, "Siva, then in his mercy, reveals himself and 'takes them both into his heaven.' In the story the animals so selflessly absorb themselves in their devotion to siva, and siva's loving response to them becomes the basis for the narrative of the temple's sacred origin. According to the narrative, the temple is quite literally founded on the devotion of a spider, a snake, and an elephant." 49Bonaventure Major Life of St. Francis 8. 9.</page><page sequence="22">422 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW traditions generally agree that animals orient themselves to God out of instinct, rather than out of conscious conformity to His will. Primordially granted in Eden, that moment-to-moment decision remains the human prerogative. In exercising it, human beings are eternally free either to redeem or to damn themselves. Animals do not share the same choice, and are not free to subvert the will of their Creator. In this sense, drawn like moths to flame, they are naturally or "instinctively" devout, and their inchoate impulse to glorify God must always be understood in ortho- dox terms as occupying a kind of exalted place on the same existential spectrum that includes everything else they do. In monotheistic terms, animals are infinitely less spiritually complex than human beings.S° Yet like the powerful and perfect yet one- dimensional angels, animals in their less differentiated condition commend themselves to us and to God in a kind of purity. Let us for a moment remove ourselves from the comfortable stance of the study of religion and ask whether what religion indicates about animals and God is true. The fact that animals can think, that they are not Cartesian machines, is no longer disputed.5l But what about animal consciousness? Do animals have spiritual aware- ness? Can they pray? Do they know God? Does He know them? These issues are perhaps most productively considered in terms of the recent debate in zoology over animal consciousness, which is distinguishable from animal cognition. In The Psychology of Consciousness, G. William Farthing used the term "primary consciousness" to refer to "the direct experience of percepts and feelings, and thoughts and memories arising in direct response to them."52 Comparative zo- ologist Donald Griffin directs our attention to the "more challenging question of whether animals experience reflective consciousness, which psychologist T. Natsoulas called 'being aware of, of being in a position to be aware of, one's own perception, thought, or any other occurrent mental episode.' Many scientists tend to believe that only reflective consciousness is 'the real thing,' and that a creature is not truly con- scious unless it can think about its own thought."53 To the above, then, we might add: 50Again, one can find support for the charge that classical Christian thought, particularly in the medieval period, has often not ascribed reason to animals. Thomas Aquinas writes, "Dumb animals and plants are devoid of the life of reason whereby to set themselves in motion; they are moved, as it were by another, by a kind of natural impulse, a sign of which is that they are naturally enslaved and accommodated to the uses of others" (Summa Theologica, Question 64, Article 1). This premise has in turn informed scientific research into questions of animal men- tation, as discussed below. 5'Masri rightly observes that "the most our scientists have credited animals with are some propensities such as instinct and intuition. Research work in this field starts with the hypothesis that no creature other than . . . humans has been endowed with a conscious mind and hence, has no faculty for psychical cognition" (Masri, Animals in Islam, 11). 52G.

Can they think about thinking? In short, are animals theological subjects rather than animated objects in the consecrated landscape? Research into questions of animal mentation begins to reveal a different, albeit still contested, picture from the previous one that tended to depict animals as reac- tive objects.54 Psychologist Robert Boakes, for example, asserts: Attributing conscious thought to animals should be strenuously avoided in any serious attempt to understand their behavior, since it is untestable, empty, obstructionist and based on a false dichotomy.... By the age of 3 years most children can describe in detail some arbitrary event or scene in the objective world that the listener cannot directly perceive. No such ability has been found in any other species.... This uniquely human ability can then be used to report of a subjective world. In its absence there is no way of knowing what this might be like for a non- human creature.55 Experiments in cognitive ethology have begun to investigate the possibility of private subjective experience on the part of animals and birds, long advocated by researchers such as Lorenz56 and Hediger.s7 Animals are quite capable of analyti- cally evaluating a situation and making appropriate behavioral moves according to variable factors, even ones they have never encountered before. They think; they decide; they remember; they also seem to experience a range of emotions. The ancient world knew what we seem to have forgotten, and hence fables of animals who weep or love seem quaint to us. In a recent study of ritual weeping, Gary Ebersole highlights the "distortions in our vision"58 caused by the unexamined assumption that only human beings experience emotion.59 on the debate. Here Griffin cites Thomas Natsoulas, "Consciousness," in American Psycholo- gist 33, 2 (1978) 906-14. 54Summarizing this position, Helena Cronin responded to the publication of Griffin's Animal Minds (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,1992) with the following: "All that Mr. Griffin' s animal stories illustrate is the immense power of information-processing machinery to pro- duce versatile behavior. But information processing need not involve consciousness . . . my computer had to be programmed. So did the animals. Their programmer is natural selection, which writes in the language of genes." 55Robert Boakes, "Subjective Experience," Times Higher Education Supplement, 29 November 1992, 22. 56Konrad Lorenz, Studies in Animal and Human Behavior, vol. 2 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1971). 57Heini Hediger, "Ist das tierliche Bewusstsein unerforschbar?"

Among other things, he suggests that "animals are actors who choose what to do, although their choices are often constrained within quite narrow limits. Thus it is more realistic to view them as selective doers rather than as objects totally dependent on outside influences." In response to objections such as those of Boakes, he remarks: "Communicative behavior of animals can serve the same basic function as human verbal and nonverbal communication by express- ing at least some of an animal's private experiences." Most importantly, he notes that "[a]s far as we know, there is no special neuroanatomical 'packaging' that is essential for conscious as opposed to nonconscious thinking." Griffin concludes, "in many discussions of animal cognition and mentality learning is considered to be an alternative to consciousness. This is a curious historical anomaly, which probably results from a deep-seated aversion to the idea that nonhuman animals might some- times be conscious."60 As for reflexivity, he observes: "If consciousness is important to us, and if it exists in other creatures, then it is probably important to them.''61 Shall we assume, along with so many modern and postmodern sociologies of religion, that religious thought is humanly constructed thought that only encodes social and cultural values? Through this lens, "religious" animals are colorful elabo- only humans weep] to be normative and universal, then the very myths and tales through which other people have posed and explored questions surrounding human and nonhuman nature are perforce dismissed as being little more than the products of anthropomorphic projections, unconscious fantasies of some sort, or the creations of a primitive mentality." For further dis- cussion of the unquestioned charge of "anthropomorphism" levied against human-like behaviors in both God and beasts, see the next section of the present discussion, "Divine Ipseity." 59Scientifically challenged first by Charles Darwin, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (London: Murray, 1872), and most consistently in recent history by Donald R. Griffin (see Animal Minds [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992] and "From Cognition to Consciousness," cited previously). See also the far less rigorous work of psychoanalyst Jeffrey Masson, When Elephants Weep: The Emotional Lives of Animals (New York: Delacorte Press, 1995). 60Griffin, "From Cognition to Consciousness," 6. Griffin observes that "locating where in a brain some function occurs tells us almost nothing about how human or other brains generate conscious as opposed to nonconscious thinking, as emphasized by Chalmers (1996) and Block (1996). Therefore there is no basic reason why cephalopods or insects cannot be conscious simply because the gross anatomy of their small but intricately central nervous systems is very different from ours." Griffin' s response to criticisms such as Helena Cronin' s, in other words, is that genetic programming does not preclude consciousness. "Interactions among neurons, synapses, and possibly glial cells are also assumed to generate conscious experience. Given these assumptions, how can we be certain that genetic influences do not also guide or even determine some of the conscious experiences to which these nervous systems arise?" (Griffin, "From Cognition to Consciousness," 12). 6'Donald R.

These seldom challenged assumptions neatly dovetail with the sociological (paral- leled by the existentialist) tenet that we human beings are the center of the universe and e source of its meaning-making. In my own work as an historian of religion, I have discovered the notion of religion as a purely social construction to be radically unhelpful-certainly in the task of historically reconstructing religious phenomena and interactions, but even more so in the problematic task of their interpretation. If we are willing to turn the tables for a moment or two, and work with the premise that, rather than the "evolution" of the human imagination, the myriad histories of religion reveal instead the inexhaustibly myriad aspects of the divine nature, however culturally inflected (in other words, that in some sense, however elusive, these histories are "about" what they themselves represent), then we avoid the kind of patronizing theological imperialism that purely social constructions of religion so often produce. If, with many ethologists, we concede the possibility of animal consciousness of self-existence, then we must also concede the possibility of animal consciousness of ultimate existence. If animals can think, and if they are in any sense reflexively aware of thinking and if God exists- then what is left to militate against the possibility that animals can think about God? The renowned primate researcher Jane Goodall considers the implications of the behavior of chimpanzees she has observed in the wilderness staring transfixed at a rushing waterfall. She characterizes this transfixed state as "awe," suggesting that primate expressions of awe at a waterfall site "may resemble the emotions that led early humans to religion."62 In other words, her decades of familiarity with the chimpanzees leads her to place their response on the spectrum of religious con- sciousness rather than utterly apart from it. Goodall's experiences in the jungles of Gombe that seem to bear witness to a greater and ineffable reality in which the wildlife is more than decoration, but rather comprises integral participants, each with its own particular, irreplaceable note in a symphony reminiscent of that of Pereq Airah: The scene was breathtaking in its beauty. In the oft sunlight, the chim- panzees' black coats were shot with coppery brown, the branches on which they sat were wet and dark as ebony, the young leaves a pale but brilliant green. And behind was the dramatic backcloth of the indigo sky where lightning flickered and distant thunder growled and rumbled. 62Peter Miller, "Jane Goodall," National Geographic, 188 (1995) 102-29, esp. 1 10. Goodall reiterated those views orally in an televised interview for National Geographic the same year. Five years earlier, she wondered whether the wild displays are "expressing feelings of awe such as those which, in early man, surely gave rise to primitive religions, worship of the elements?"Jane Goodall, Through a Window: Thirty Years with the Chimpanzees of Gombe (London: Penguin, 1990) 202.</page><page sequence="26">426 HARVARD THEOLOG ICAL REVI EW Lost in awe at the beauty around me, I must have slipped into a state of heightened awareness. It is hard-impossible, really- to put into words the moment of truth that came upon me then. Even the mystics are unable to describe their brief flashes of spiritual ecstasy. It seemed to me, as I struggled afterward to recall the experience, that self was utterly absent: I and the chimpanzees, the earth and trees and air, seemed to merge, to become one with the spirit power of life itself. The air was filled with a feathered symphony, the even-song of birds. I heard new frequencies in their music and also in the singing insects' voices notes so high and sweet I was amazed. Never had I been so intensely aware of the shape, the color of the individual leaves, the patterns of the veins that made each one unique. Scents were clear as well, easily identifiable: fermenting, over-ripe fruit; waterlogged earth; cold, wet, bark; the damp odor of chimpanzee hair and yes, my own too. And the aromatic scent of young, crushed leaves was almost over- powering. I sensed a new presence, then saw a bushbuck, quietly browsing upwind, his spiraled horns gleaming and his chestnut coat dark with rain. Suddenly a distant chorus of pant-hoots elicited a reply from Fifi. As though wakening from some vivid dream I was back in the everyday world, cold, yet intensely alive. When the chimpanzees left, I stayed in that place it seemed a most sacred place scribbling some notes, try- ing to describe, what, ever so briefly, I had experienced. I had not been visited by the angels or other heavenly beings that characterize the visions of the great mystics or the saints, yet for all that I believe it truly was a mystical experience.63 Is this nature mysticism, religious experience irreconcilable with covenantal, scriptural, or prophetic revelation? Goodall is quite clear that a distinction between the God of organized religious institutions, of "culture," and the God that animates "nature" is not an authentic one. She writes of the sense of a call to action she heard while standing in the cathedral at Notre Dame years before her life in Tanzania: "I think I heard . . . the voice of God . . .: And I did not hear any words, only the sound.... It helped me to realize that the spiritual power that I felt so strongly in the wild and beautiful world of the forest was one and the same with that which I had known in my childhood, in the days of Trevor, in the days when I used to spend long hours in ancient cathedrals." If we follow Goodall in rejecting such a dichotomy, then we are closer to a kind of theological realism. We encoun- ter a divine Self that is expressed both in revealed religions as well as in the myriad kingdoms of its own making, a God Who, although revealed, cannot be fully con- tained either by the countless forms of religious orthodoxy or by the inexhaustible 63Jane Goodall, Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey / Jane Goodall with Philip Berman (New York; Warner Books, Inc., 1999) 173-74.</page><page sequence="27">KIMBERLEY PATTON 427 variety of natural forms. Instead, as Goodall's experience intimates, He overflows both vessels infinitely pouring Himself out in the finite world He has made, show- ing Himself in each exquisite being even as it turns to greet Him. "But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; And the fowls of the air, and they shall teach thee; Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; And the Elshes of the sea shall declare unto thee!" (Job 12:7-8). XgDivine Ipseity In 1994 I attended a weeklong conference on classical Christian theology at Rose Hill Center in Aiken, South Carolina. There I heard Father Thomas Hopko, profes- sor of dogmatic theology and dean of Saint Vladimir's seminary, the preeminent Russian Orthodox seminary in this country, expound on the theology of creation. Much to my alarm, Father Hopko began his lecture with what he called the "rabbithood of God." He said that in contemplating a rabbit, a Christian might think in terms of "the rabbithood of God," which any rabbit reveals. Now this idea does not draw its theological strength from some kind of wild application of the Genesis passage in which human beings are created in God's image. In other words, I do not believe that Father Hopko was suggesting that God is a big bunny (or even four hundred bunnies, as the Mayans had it). Rather, he was directing our attention to the way in which a rabbit reveals something unique about who God is, some dimension of His being that is, in a word, rabbity. For no apparent reason other than joy, rabbits leap high into the air, twist their furry bodies, and kick out their feet in abandon. There is an aspect of God's Self that at creation expressed itself as a rabbit, and nothing can better reveal that particular aspect of the divine nature than a real, living rabbit. In some ways, we can compare this to Eastern ideas: the rabbit is more than just a rabbit, but is instead a metaphysical participant on the great playing field of the cosmos. It is interesting that ie charge of "aniropomorphism" is so often deployed in both theology and zoology, and thus about both God and animals. It is developed thoroughly in the thought of al-GhazAll, Maimonides, and Aquinas, who warn against any ideation about God that seems to draw from human appearance, emotion, or action (such as God's keeping a schedule or playing with Leviathan). These, the argument goes, are ultimately distorted, inadequate, and thus religiously dangerous, although to varying degrees all of these thinkers concede the naturalness and even the necessity of such ideation. The God Who has a face too bright to behold, or Who cries out like a woman in the travail of childbirth, or Who passionately desires rela- tionship with us, must surely represent the projection of our own natures.64 In the case of animals, the attribution of behaviors or feelings that resemble our own have 64Or the Durkheimian sublimation of collective social values, the Freudian sublimation of unresolved infantile yearnings for paternal power and care, and so on.</page><page sequence="28">428 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW also been dismissed in scientific culture as "anthropomorphizing" as non- objective. Increasingly, as we have seen, this charge has been challenged by ani- mal behaviorists themselves.65 Animals are surely not completely like us. Neither, however, are they completely "other." The truth, and hence its theological impli- cations, is more complicated. It may be that religious ideas of God are not inappropriately patterned after our knowledge of ourselves as human beings, nor that we need constantly guard against the temptation to perceive our own consciousness in animals. It may be that anthropomorphism is not the threat it is made out to be either in theology or in comparative zoology, but rather that it consistently points to something else. It may be rather that both human beings and animals are theomorphic. To understand this idea we must refer to the notion of divine ipseity, virtually identifiable with the classical theological notion of "aseity." Although the concept is clearly found in Hindu philosophy as well, these particular terms refer to the monotheistic principle of God's complete ontological self-sufficiency His independent non-origination, and the way in which He makes everything and re- lates to eveIything in a completely reflexive way. This is reflected, for example, in a prayer for the Prophet in contemporary Muslim use: Call down blessing on him with that salat with which Thou didst call down blessing on Him in the mihrab of Thy transcendent holiness and the Ipseity of Thine intimacy.66 As the Patistic writers had it,67 God is by definition entirely sui generis, self- sufElcient and self-referential. Ipseity drives the philosophical terminology of Anselm 65Goodall, charged by paleontologist Louis Leakey to study African chimpanzees in the hopes of deepening our knowledge of earlier human nature in the course of evolution, writes of her initial work in Gombe, Tanzinia: "And all the time I was learning more and more about the chimpanzees. As I got to know them as individuals I named them. I had no idea that this, according to the ethological disciplines of the early 1960s, was inappropriate I should have given them more objective numbers. I also described their vivid personalities another sin: only humans had per- sonalities. It was an even worse crime to attribute human life emotions to the chimpanzees. And in those days it was held (at least by many scientists, philosophers, and theologians) that only humans had minds, only humans were capable of rational thought. Fortunately I had not been to university, and I did not know these things. And when I did find out, I just thought it was silly and paid no attention. I had always named the animals in my life. Moreover, Rusty [Goodall's child- hood dog] and a series of cats, and assorted guinea pigs and golden hamsters, had taught me well. They had made it abundantly clear that animals had personalities, could reason and solve prob- lems, had minds, had emotions I thus felt no hesitation in ascribing these qualities to the chimpanzees. How right Louis had been to send someone to the field with a mind uncluttered by the theory of reductionist, oversimplistic, mechanistic science" (Goodall, Reason for Hope, 74). 66In the prayer-manual as-.Saldtu 'I-ghaibEyya, cited in Constance E.

If this is true, then God's ongoing creative activity in the world, indeed, of every aspect of the material world that surrounds us, can be understood as a kind of reflexive self- expression whereby God seeks to reveal Himself, to be known, and to be praised. Thus ritual praise itself becomes a kind of self-referential hymnody. Although human beings alone are made in his image and likeness, God's joy in Leviathan would thus show the profound theomorphism that we share with ani- mals. We are His replicas, with all the attendant ethical and religious responsibilities that entails; but they, too, in some sense participate in His nature, and what is more, reveal it in ways we cannot. An echo of the theology of Job may be heard here, not only in its awe-inspiring image of the godhead, a perfect illustration of Otto's mysterium tremendum etfascinans, but also in the ways in which the book's theophany plays itself out in terms of the myriad forms of creation, from the great- est to the very tiniest. James Hillman writes, "Theology says the divine is a tremendum, but a tremendum can come in small tremulous ways, a mere tremor, a shake, brush, shlug the swift reaction to an insect. Because we are one of the very largest of the animal species, we expect only the larger to be more tremen- dous. That God must be as large as Behemoth is one more Biblical anthropomorphism. Actually, behemoth means merely 'animal,' so what Job saw Augustine City of God 11.10; Athanasius Against the Heathen §28; idem, Defending the Nicene Definition 3.11; Gregory of Nyssa To Eunomius 3.5; Cyril of Jerusalem Catechetical Lectures 4.1.4 and 6.7; Gregory of Nazianzen Orations 30; Hilary of Poitiers On the Trinity 2.6-7; John of Damascus Exposition of the Orthodox Faith 1.9-14.

Ronald Thiemann remarks, "Anselm himself seems not to use 'aseity' as a technical term; rather, he provides some of the classic reflections on the nature of God's freedom, i.e., that God's freedom, understood as self-determination, makes possible God's free gift of creation without God in any manner being bound either to create or, once he had created, being bound by that creation except as God has freely determined so to be bound. Thus God remains graciously free but still in relation to everything in the universe.

Just look. Watch the animal and see the divine in self-display. Study the shiny shell and veined wings, the feeling feet, the driving determination. Study the head, the coat, the motions. Study the eye, each its own kind, like a bead, a dot, millionfold, like a fly' s."69 "The divine in self-display": there is the paradox. In monotheistic terms, the creature is not God, is not "divinized." Yet it is divine. In the creature, whether behemoth or dragonfly, something of God's inexhaustible nature is revealed, something that would not be revealed if that particular creature did not exist. In the vision of St. Dionysius the Areopagite (pseudo-Dionysius) expressed in the sixth century CE, God emanates matter, even overflows with it in reflexive abundance: "Since the Cause of all things is Himself overflowing with them in one transcendent excess of all, He is called 'Holy of Holies' and all those other names. For He is, you might say, brimming causality and supreme transcendence."70 Despite its obvious Neoplatonic heritage, this is by no means Plotinian emanationism with a thin Christian veneer, nor is it crypto-pantheism. Rather, as St. Maximos the Confessor labored mightily to reveal in his Scholia on the works of St. Dionysius, it is in the end orthodox, trinitarian, conciliar. However, it is also anogogic, mystical theology whereby the entire created world becomes a form of ecstatic Self-expression. God's creative excess in turn engenders His divine fasci- nation, joy, even yearning: "'Love for you came on me like love for women [after 2 Sam 1:26]' someone says. To those listening properly to the divine things the name 'love' is used by the sacred writers in divine revelation with the exact same meaning as the term 'yearning.' What is signified is a capacity to effect such a unity, an alliance, and a particular commingling in the Beautiful and the Good.''71 God, who "in His internal triadic life"72 is understood as "the whole of eros,"73 adores that which He has made, which is outside of Him "through the superabun- dance of His erotic goodness."74 The Godhead, as it were, creates itself outward into all things and then yearns passionately for their return.75 "This divine yearn- 69James Hillman, Dream Animals (San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 1997) 86-88. 70Pseudo-Dionysius (St. Dionysius the Aereopagite) On the Divine Names 972A; PG 3.12.4, trans. by Colm Luibheid, in Pseudo-Dionysius: The Complete Works, The Classics of Western Spirituality (New York: Paulist, 1987). 7lIbid., 709C-709D; PG 3.4.12, trans.

In Islamic theology we only know of God what is permitted by his great grace and our limited scope. As the Spanish mystic Ibn 'Arabl wrote, "no one can know God except in keeping with what His own essence provides."77 Many phrases in the Quran suggest the nonexistence of everything except God. Indeed this is His unique quality that he is qayyum ("self-subsisting"). He alone subsists in Himself, while "things through their own essence have nothing but non-existence, and existence comes to them only from something else, by way of a loan. But the existence of Allah is essential, unborrowed. This reality of self- subsistence belongs to Allah alone."78 The Quran consistently offers a vision of a world created by the mind of God and whose sole corresponding purpose is to submit to Him and to glorify Him a world caught up in Islam. At Surah 13:15 we hear: "Whatever beings there are in the heavens and the earth do prostrate themselves to Allah (acknowledging sub- jection) with goodwill or in spite of themselves: so do their shadows in the morning and the evenings." Sufi poets amplify this in glorious fashion, as in Rumi's image of the salat of the little violets bending their heads over their green prayer rugs. All that God makes, including animals, is a form of self-expression, a self-referential hymn of glory; all that He has made yearns to praise Him. As I noted at the outset of the essay, in Genesis 2 God creates the animals for Adam, by way of searching for "a helper as his partner" and then brings them to Adam to "see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name" (Gen 2:19). Adam gives names "to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field; but as for the man there was and restores the image of God corrupted within them. It is the sacred stability which is there for them when the tide of unholiness is tossing them about. It is safety for those who made a stand. It is the guide bringing upward those uplifted to it and is the enlightenment of the illuminated. Source of perfection for those being made perfect, source of divinity for those being deified, principle of simplicity for those turning toward simplicity, point of unity for those made one; transcendently, beyond what is, it is the Source of every source. Generously and as far as may be, it gives out a share of what is hidden. To sum up, it is the Life of the living, the being of beings, it is the Source and the Cause of all life and of all being, for out of its goodness it commands all things to be and it keeps them going" (pseudo-Dionysius, On the Divine Names, 589B-589C, trans.

The traditional icon of this usually breathes an atmosphere of sweet concentration that is hard to describe. The medi- eval fresco at Anapafsas Monastery at Meteora in Greece, for example, shows the animals and birds converging at Adam's feet: patient lion, proud eagle, and over- eager serpent joined by fantastic creatures like griffin and phoenix, the latter being the only creature who will not eat of the fruit of the Tree. Their gazes interlock. The flrst man, himself brand new, contemplates them carefully and points thought- fully to each, clearly aware of the import of what he is doing. By delegating to the first human being the theurgic power of naming the animals, God brokers their bond: in addition to setting Adam above the animals, He gives him the power of defining them. Most importantly, He thus puts Adam into relationship with them. He asks one of His creatures, the one made in His image, to confer identity upon the others. In a sense, then, in the process of naming them, Adam thus assumes God's own role in relation to the animals. Symboli- cally, this is only intelligible if one understands the creatures as being of deep, original, and abiding interest to God, an interest that is by no means abrogated simply because the first week of creation is over and the Fall takes place. It is iconographically realized in ancient Christian images of God Himself depicted as a holy person creating the animals: the same concentration is felt, the same inter- locked gaze between the individual and the group, the same sense of awe.79 Naming is a second creation, paralleling divine origination. In contrast to the task Adam faces in Genesis, in the Quranic version, God teaches Adam, his newly created "viceregent" (khahfatAllah) on earth, the names of all things, including those of the animals. He withholds these names from the angels, who had opposed Adam's creation in anticipation of the mayhem that he would create on earth while they were praising God. God then challenges the angels to recite these names; the angels are compelled to confess their lack of independent knowledge apart from what God has taught them. Proudly, as a kind of proof of Adam's election, God asks Adam to tell the angels the names of things which have been divulged only to him. God then commands the angels to bow down to the new being, which they do, save Iblls (S 2:3s34). Most Quranic commentaries take "the names of things" as signifying their inner nature, their essence. In an ancient Muslim tradition dating back to a hadffth reported by Abu Hurayrah, God too has multiple names or attributes.80 He is, for example, Ar-Rahman, "the All Merciful"; 'Al-Musawwir, "the Shaper of Beauty"; 'Al-Basith, "the Resurrector." Sheikh Tosun al-Halveti writes, "There are 99 names 79A lovely example is God Creating the Animals, an illumination from the Bodleian Library at Oxford, reproduced on the cover of Andrew Linzey's Animal Theology. 80See Louis Gardet, "al-asma' al-husna," Encyclopedia of lslam, 2d ed., 1. 714-17; Daniel Gimaret, Les noms divins en lslam: exe'gese lexicographique et the'ologique (Paris: Editions du Cerf, 1988).</page><page sequence="33">KIMBERLEY PATTON 433 that are Allah's alone. Whoever learns, understands, and enumerates (ihsa) them enters Paradise and achieves eternal salvation.''8l In the thought of Ibn 'Arabl, the signiElcance of the multiple names taught to Adam is no less than that of the multi- dimensional Essence of God, which only Adam can grasp since only he reflects it: The angels do not grasp that which is supplied by the ontological plane of the viceregent [that is, man], nor do they grasp the worship of the Essence that is demanded by the ontological level of God. For no one can know God except in keeping with what his own essence provides, and the angels do not possess Adam's all-comprehensiveness [since only mankind manifests the name "Allah," which comprehends all other Names]. They do not grasp the Divine Names pertaining only to Adam's all-comprehensive level. They glorify God and call him holy (Quran II, 30) but they do not know that He has Names which their knowledge does not embrace. Thus they do not glorify Him by these Names, nor do they call him holy in the same way that Adam does.82 Thus the multiple names or attributes of God are symbolically represented by the "names of things" taught to Adam. Animal names "mirror" divine names. Essence mirrors Essence. The multiple dimensions of God in his oneness are refracted by the diffierentiated state of the creation (khalq), including the multi- plicity of the animal species, each with its special name. In divine ipseity, in kaleidoscopic individuation, the living world creates the beauty of its Source. Let us return to Leviathan, who plays with God. Leviathan is a primordial crea- ture of the Lord, one that He makes. He does not make it in His own image, like man and woman. But if we accept Hopko's idea of "the rabbithood of God" as a kind of intuition of the holy imprint the charismatic potential to express God that is inherent in every creature then the Lord Himself is not only known and clearly dominated by Leviathan, but seen in him also. Leviathan is a form of God's creative self-realization. It is a form that has to do with vastness, with the watery deeps that He must subdue at the beginning of all time. Even more astonishingly, the relationship depicted in 'Abodah Zarah has to do with interlocking metaphysics and with mutual joy: that of the great animal and that of the Creator. Ha-Shem has a special friendship with Leviathan, whom He made, and who in a circumscribed yet un- mistakable way reflects His own nature back to Him just as the thirty pilgrim birds are reflected in the mirror of the Simorgh. 8tThe Most Beautiful Names, compiled by Sheik Tosun Bayrak al-Jerrahi al-Halveti (Putney, Vermont: Threshold Books, 1985). Traditionally, God has more than ninety-nine names; rather, there are three thousand: "One thousand He has revealed to His angels; one thousand He has revealed to His prophets; three hundred are in the zabdr the psalms of David; three hundred are in the Torah; three hundred are in the Gospel[s]; 99 are in the Holy Qur'an. One, the name of His Essence, He has kept for Himself and hidden in the Qur'an" (The Most Beautiful Names, 3). 82Ibn 'Arabi, Fusus al-h. ikam, trans.

Surely we have heard the thundering echoes of God's despair-of His mighty weeping throughout the terrible century that we have now left behind. Perhaps in the unique religious orientation of animals, in their idiosyncratic and joyous devotion to the One who brought them into being- and in His reciprocally fierce and tender devotion to them we can strain to hear the echoes of His laughter.</page></plain_text>
