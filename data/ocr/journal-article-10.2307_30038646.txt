<plain_text><page sequence="1">HESIOD'S TREATISE ON JUSTICE: WORKS AND DAYS 109-380 Abstract: In this article I argue that the middle portion of Hesiod's poem is a coher- ent essay on the concept of dike ("justice"). He structures the piece as, in order, an account of the past; a quasi-prophecy of a possible dire present/future; and a state- ment of the theory and practice of dike which is necessary to guard against such an outcome. He thereby portrays the concept as an all-embracing guide to life, and one which includes the need for fruitful labor in particular. I take account of interpreta- tions that conflict with these conclusions. I. Orientation: thoughts on the poem's structure. T he structure of Hesiod's Works and Days is of course a troubled subject of long standing.1 I will not attempt to solve the prob- lem in this space. However, I am unable to understand the sub- ject of this article, vv. 109-380 of the poem, without questioning a group of opinions whereby the overall work is a thematic develop- ment of one or more of the narratives found at its beginning. A now classic view is to say that the so-called myths of Prometheus and Pandora, 42- or 47-105, and five races (or "ages"), 106-201, explain the need for what are seen as the poem's main themes, work and justice, respectively.2 Alternatively, some say that the narrative of good and bad Erides, 11-26, yields the parts of the poem which fea- ture constructive and destructive activity, respectively.3 Most re- cently, according to Jenny Strauss Clay in her new study of the He- siodic poems, "it could be said" that the rest of our text is "an elabo- ration of [all] three myths."4 In recent times this "aetiological" line of 1 Here I will mostly consider material published recently. Older work is cited by Bona Quaglia (1973) 1-13; West (1978) 41-59; Hamilton (1989) 48, 113-15. Recent He- siod bibliographies are Arrighetti (1998) xxxviii-lxvi; Nelson (1998) 231-45; Clay (2003) 183-98. I cite commentaries mostly by verse rather than page. All translations are my own. 2 See, e.g., Verdenius (1985) ad 91, 106. 3 This is the view in particular of Richard Hamilton (1989) 53-66, following oth- ers he cites (115 nn. 28, 30). 4 See Clay (2003) 142; cf. 141-2 and 37-8, where she relates Prometheus-Pandora and the races to work and justice, respectively, in the classic mode. Others (e.g., Malcolm Heath (1985)) simply think of a first part of the poem introducing the second in a general way. THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL 101.2 (2005/06) 161-82</page><page sequence="2">162 E. F. BEALL attack has constituted the most common way to consider the work's organization, although there are other approaches that do not posit mutual dependence of parts at the level of structure.5 But what if the races narrative is not myth? Hartmut Erbse has suggested that the poem's basis is, rather, the theoretical justice dis- cussion coming after it in the poem, while supporting a dissident assertion that the races account shows a budding historical con- sciousness. Moreover, his essay concludes that justice and work, far from constituting separate themes as the aetiological approach tends to say, are interdependent, in that it is justice, intimately associated with the races but not with the Prometheus-Pandora narrative, which makes work necessary and also renders it fruitful.6 This would imply that the Prometheus-Pandora segment is not required to explain labor, and indeed I do not see how this can be its function. Vv. 11-105 (possibly also including the proemium, 1-10) seem to form a continuous narrative which, while essentially mythi- cal, has another thrust. That is, the section alludes to the Theogony without challenging the latter's mythic basis, both at its beginning, the Erides, and at its end, the Prometheus-Pandora segment, while a nominally didactic segment in the interim is easily read as a specifi- cation of the Erides.7 All this unfolds without clear internal divi- sions.s The passage's result is that humans are now beset by evils, especially diseases which, however, will not be mentioned again in the poem (nousoi, 92, 102-4). And despite the common view that these evils include the labor required for the later works and days proper, they do not do so unambiguously.9 Moreover, any implica- 5 Of the latter views, especially, Stephanie Nelson (1998) 46-8 sees three parts which are related by common themes but are not connected by structural considera- tions. Francisco Rodriguez Adrados (2001) 214-22 and Andre Lardinois (2003) posit commonalities for the various parts other than by theme, but also without suggesting mutual relations. 6 See Erbse (1993) 20 (the dissident view is that of Thomas Rosenmeyer (1957)) and 27-8, respectively. 7 The two Erides (vv. 11-12) correct the single Eris at Th. 225-32; see most re- cently Clay (2003) 7. Vv. 42- or 47-105 allude to Th. 535-613, although also to material not found in that poem: the concept of Pandora and some example of the foolish First Woman archetype; see Beall (1991) 362-6 (containing further references). On 27ff specifying 11-26, see originally Kumaniecki (1963) 80, and now Nelson (1998) 48; Ro- driguez Adrados (2001) 216. Allusion to the Theogony is also a key characteristic of the proemium: Martin West (1978) 136-42 suggests numerous parallels (add: 9 compared with Th. 84-6); Willem Verdenius (1985) 1-14 disputes some of these, but not all. 8 Apart from vv. 27-41 or -46 specifying 11-26, the usual isolation of 42- or 47- 105 as a set piece, a "version" of "the" Prometheus myth, seems artificial since it is hybrid in origin (above, n. 7), so that there is no more reason to posit a section bound- ary at the segment's beginning than at two places internal to it (80 and 90). And its beginning is already ambiguous: e.g., Clay (2003) 117-18 takes this to be at 42, but, e.g., West (1978) at 47. 9 This point is most recently noted by Glenn Most (1993) 88-9. It is possible in principle to interpret the ponos from which men were distant before Pandora (v. 91) as</page><page sequence="3">HESIOD'S TREATISE ON JUSTICE 163 tion that labor is one of them conflicts with the positive assessment of work within the Erides discussion (20-6), a weighty consideration for a continuous piece.10 As to the narrative's actual role, without taking positions on the difficulties in defining "myth" precisely, it seems to me that vv. 11- 105 can only introduce the poem by contributing what might be called mythic values, not thematically. That is, they do not propose a subject such as labor which is then elaborated discursively; rather, to the extent that they underly the later work it is through reflections of motifs, generally at an implicit level. An example is that, as Maria Marsilio notes, the winter maiden description of 519-24 recalls Pan- dora's jar in 94-9, not by the poet saying outright that "this useless girl sitting inside her house reminds me of Elpis in the jar," but through such means as recalling its language.11 Moreover, the aetiology of drudgery the conventional approach attributes to the narrative would be insufficient to introduce the poem in any case, because life on a farm, as reflected in the key agri- implicitly including drudgery (so, e.g., Verdenius (1985) ad loc.), but why does not the poet simply say that the evils included the specific word for it, kamatos, especially since he holds that to be part of his own present (177)? The need to work because the bios is hidden is stated at 42-6, but this seems to be simply a statement of a fact of life, even if "the gods" are said to be responsible, not something resulting from actions of specific personalities in the past comparable to Pandora's act which the aetiological view says specifies it. (The aorist participle krupsantes implies a still continuing activ- ity of "hiding.") 10 Of course, to assign three sections to vv. 11-105 fits the standard mode of dis- cussing the poem as a certain sequence of set pieces, while seeing the issue of struc- ture as a matter of combining precisely these pieces into major parts and of their rela- tions. Walter Nicolai (1964) esp. 9-10 in particular raises this division, and even fur- ther sub-division, to the level of a principle. However, in one dissent from viewing the poem in this way, Berkeley Peabody (1975) 236-47, 471-2 n. 43, 481-2 n. 68 is able to read 27-105 as a single piece. 11 One might attempt to characterize this phenomenon more precisely elsewhere, but apart from Marsilio (1997) (earlier, cf. Hamilton (1989) 72), the jar-opening motif is combined with the key activities of plowing and sailing at vv. 814-18 (see Hamilton (1989) 83-4), while despite her denial of structure (above, n. 5), Nelson (1998) 168 sug- gests that the "hiding" cited at 42-50 is reflected in hiding seeds at 469-71. Indeed, 11- 105 suggest a poem about the earth (as the Theogony is a poem about the sky; cf. Benardete (1967) 152): Zeus sets the good Strife in earth (19); woman is made by mud- dying earth with water (61); and after she acts, the earth is full of evils, as is the sea (101). The latter earth::water relation might be seen in a neo-Structuralist manner, as basing the later work on land vs. sea. Perhaps one could also apply the point to Mi- chael Gagarin's (1990) claim that the "ambiguity" of eris at the start of the poem founds the ambiguities of the later poem such as aid6s being both good and bad, or Zeus sending rain either to help or hurt the farmer. Hesiod hardly thereby treats am- biguity in itself as a theme, whereas such a polarity of opposites is of course basic to Structuralist myth analysis.</page><page sequence="4">164 E. F. BEALL cultural portion, is not only hard work.12 If there is negative material it is in the winter section, the problem being precisely that one cannot work.13 Indeed, while anthropomorphic myth remained an important force into the classical period, Greece was a more complex society than were the hunter-gatherer cultures where it originated and formed the sole intellectual basis. In vv. 11-105 the only sense one gets of a community that might be relevant to Hesiod's actual milieu is that citizens are in strife with one another, be it good or bad.14 Even the individual is left undefined, in that nothing in the piece gives humans the faculty of choice, in particular of whether or not to work.15 Something more is needed. In sum, while the motif structure shows that vv. 11-105 do play some role in the poem, that role is not straightforward and Hesiod scholarship needs to reconsider it.16 Coming to the sequel about races, the position that it is a myth should not be imposed a priori. I imagine the early listener familiar with epic would suspect that something quite different was coming from what Hesiod says in the transition segment: "if you will," he will give "another account" (heteros logos) with expertise (vv. 106-7 or -817). The most prominent uses of the conventional opening phrase ei d' etheleis preface something different, not just another ex- ample within the same genre, for example, Aeneas's genealogy after merely giving his patronymics." Of course, conventional interpret- 12 This fact is brought out in recent studies of the agricultural portion which point out various poetic aspects of the material; see Nelson (1998) 48-58; Marsilio (2000), esp. 15-29; Beall (2004a) and (2005). 13 Thus Nelson (1998) 55 speaks of "helplessness" in winter. 14 Hesiod does not give a myth to explain, for example, the need implied in v. 345 of reliance on neighbors, i.e., one's occupational group, rather than the primeval kin- ship systems. Hamilton (1989) 113 n. 2 avoids the stark view of community life en- tailed in basing everything on the Erides by rejecting the construal of eris as "strife." But even it merely meant "game" (as, e.g., at Od. 6.92), a society where everything is a game is limited. 15 It may even be that the statement that Zeus's will cannot be overcome (v. 105) is too Calvinist in thrust to leave room for human choice, especially given that this will is responsible for leaving Elpis in the jar (96-9). The logical conclusion is that the presence of elpis ("expectation" or "hope") in humans which one prominent reading says is the aetiology (so that the poet laments it at 498-500) means it is inevitable that people will expect riches without having to work. But we will see below that the jus- tice treatise repairs any such deficiency. 16 On the motif structure see above (n. 11). My earlier position questioning any such role ((2004b) 181; cf. (1991) 371) was too sharply conceived. 17 V. 108, which says that something that is difficult to make precise is the same for gods and humans, is much debated. To be sure, there is a fair case that it is spuri- ous; see Carriere (1991) 61-72. 18 See II. 20.213 (= 6.150, where the speaker's origins are to be given rather than nothing); and cf. also 19.142; 21.487, although the Odyssey examples (3.324; 15.80; 16.82; 17.277) are perhaps more neutral.</page><page sequence="5">HESIOD'S TREATISE ON JUSTICE 165 ers, presuming that the reference of logos here is only to the five races (109-201) in the sequel, construe it as "myth" or "story."19 Yet the term took on a more abstract sense by the time of Heraclitus (B1 D- K), and it would be arbitrary to say that this could not have hap- pened by that of Hesiod.20 And in speaking of the sequel as myth, the commentators appear to mean that in the modern sense of "non- scientific," even if it concerns groups of unnamed people; still, ar- chaic Greece itself thought a myth was a story with characters.21 Thus I hold that the actual characterization of what follows in our poem is to be gleaned from the text itself. There is nothing against assuming that heteros logos refers, rather, to the full portion 109-380. I discuss that entity as follows. II. The justice treatise: structure. The passage encompassed by vv. 109-380 has the following structure: *a description of the past as the poet sees it, 109-73 (the past races); *a negative, quasi-prophetic vision for the present-future, 174- 201; and *a vision of a positive possibility, 202-380, subdivided into (a) theory, 202-85, and (b) practice, 286-380. The argument for this breakdown is a matter of two issues. First, the concept of a set piece of five races or ages is to be aban- doned as not Hesiod's or the archaic period's, but a construct im- posed later, perhaps first by Plato in identifying social classes with the metals cited for the first three races and in the prophecy.22 To be 19 So e.g., West (1978); Verdenius (1985) ad loc.; and now Clay (2003) 37-8. 20 In a recent study of the word, Roman Dilcher (1995) 31-40 accepts the tradition on our citation without comment, but acknowledges a rational connotation of the term from the earliest use. Bruce Lincoln (1997) believes that the much discussed opposi- tion of logos to mythos was a competition between rival regimes of truth already in the archaic period; if so, a certain level of abstraction is surely implied. 21 Thus Rosenmeyer (1957) and Erbse (1993) 20 deny mythical status for the nar- rative. Moses Finley (1965) 286-7 compromises, seeing it as a myth, but one which takes a step toward logos in the sense of reason. Alain Ballabriga (1998) 312-17 says that the races correct the Prometheus-Pandora account qua myth, i.e., by eschewing the latter's anthropomorphism. 22 See Plato R. 415a. For a review of ancient derivatives, see Schwabl (1978) 783- 821. (Not all read the matter as did Plato: Aratus alludes only to the first three races, Phaen. 100-36.)

F. BEALL sure, the position that the five cohere is much championed today. The resulting alleged narrative is usually viewed as the result of He- siod or some precursor adapting a pre-existing meta-historical schema of four successively deteriorating entities, intercalating a hero race to accord with Greek tradition and thus making modern humans the fifth race.23 However, in purely formal terms the first four races function well as a self-contained section (in fact a ring composition). Although Hesiod authorities have not really taken their work seriously, this point was noted long ago by Peter Walcot, and detailed later by Carl Querbach; for example, the fourth race ends like the first begins.24 Nor is it only a formal question: the past races discussion is dif- ferent in thrust from what will follow. Each race is introduced by varying the phrase chruseon men pr6tista genos merop6n anthrop6n, "(e.g.,) gold was the (e.g.,) first race of mortal humans" that the gods created (vv. 109-10; cf. 127-8, 143-4, 157-8, with meropOn anthrdpon elided in the second case and the metal in the fourth). In three cases the subsequent treatment seems to recount traditions, such as those attested for a carefree past like the first race, or the heroes of the fourth who are explicitly stated to have fought at Thebes and Troy as in the standard mythical corpus.25 The third ("bronze") race of huge, violent men looks like the folklore motif of past giants, attested with the Greeks and with "ash" people in Indo-European tradition, whereas Hesiod's race was made "from ash" (ek melian, 145).26 Only 23 So West (1978) ad 106-201 (citing Oriental narratives as models), Verdenius (1985) ad 106, and many others; see now esp. Koenen (1994) 2-11, although he (14-22) prefers certain different sources. Clay (2003) 81 retains the notion of progressive de- cline, although this has been challenged, most recently by Nelson (1998) 70-1. To be sure, already in the 11th century the Persian scholar al-Birfini compared the Indian account of four yugas with the Greek narrative (in Aratus's version; above, n. 22); see Sachau (1964) Vol. 1, 378-85. It has long been noted that the Oriental narratives are just as likely to derive from Hesiod, and in fact the Indian account as we have it (Ma- hdbhdrata 3.148, 3.186) dates from after the Alexandrian conquest since "foreign rul- ers," including Greeks, are presupposed. 24 See Walcot (1961) 4-7; Querbach (1985). West (1978) ignores Walcot in his in- fluential commentary, while Verdenius (1985) ad 175 n. 435 only says against him that the mentions of "fifth" and "race" in the later segment show its connection with the earlier (on this, see below). Ludwig Koenen (1994) 5 n. 1 speaks cursorily against Wal- cot but ignores Querbach's fuller case. Most (1997) 108, 120 manages to quote Walcot and cite Querbach without mentioning their central thesis. Nelson (1998) 190 n. 40 merely cites them as two examples among others treating "the" myth. Arrighetti (1998) and Clay (2003) ignore both works. Thus no one has actually confronted their arguments. 25 This set of heritages has often been noted; see Ballabriga (1998) 318-39 (includ- ing 318-22 for the first race and 322-9 for the afterlives of the first two races) and his references. 26 As West (1978) ad 106-201 acknowledges, the bronze race seems to recall the Giants of Th. 50, 185, while the aged Nestor speaks of men in his youth who had de-</page><page sequence="7">HESIOD'S TREATISE ON JUSTICE 167 the second ("silver") race seems invented.27 The elision of a metal for the fourth is commonly thought to show its externality to the schema, but what metal would Hesiod cite if not the bronze that he has already mentioned for the previous race, and that epic says was used by the heroes of tradition? And why would that citation need repetition? In sum, for the most part the section serves to order tradi- tions otherwise attested, or inferred, as disparate. The ordering ei- ther is chronological or, if Kurt von Fritz is correct not to take that seriously, presents possibilities for the past without making an overt choice.28 But the transition to the sequel is more marked than any within vv. 11-105, for all the claims that that contains different sections, and that the antecedent and sequel here do not:29 [vtiKET' CpTELT' h4EXXo V E'y@ o TE[LprTOLOv [LETELVCtL dvapd0*Iv, dXX' i~ rrp6n0e OCVECLV E"1t'TaLT yEVEOatL, vv -yap 8 yvo" 3ETTL TLtTflpcov" Would that no longer henceforth I be among the "fifth men"; rather, (I should have) either died before or be born after. For right now is "the race of iron..." (174-6) The text will then go on to describe specific ills (176-201), but here we have so emotional an outburst as to violate Greek syntax, with no auxiliary verb for the second line.30 And the expressions pemptoi an- dres and genos sidereon do not simply repeat a number and metal with the term genos, as in the recipe for the first four races. Thus I assert that they simply show association of ideas with the antece- dent, in accordance with Verdenius's (1962) principle for connection of sections. The distinctive wording puts the phrases in relief, so that the effect is not the listing of one more race, but an ironic play on the feated beast-like men (II. 1.266-8). In the Icelandic Edda the Norns come from a well beneath the ash world-tree (Vbluspd 19-20), and are giants (VafthrdOnismdl 49). 27 So Eduard Meyer (1966) 501, and see now Ballabriga (1998) 326-7. 28 See von Fritz (1947) 240. 29 Against the authenticity of vv. "173a-e," which make it seem that the fifth race was created like the others, see most recently Carriere (1991) 87-93. To be sure, Most (1997) esp. 113 sees a blurred distinction between the hero and iron races of "the" narrative, while Clay (2003) 93 interprets the fifth race as a decadent version of the fourth. 30 See Sinclair (1979) ad loc. Against this straightforward construal of anacolu- thon, Verdenius (1985) ad loc. posits in effect that meketi means "never" rather than "no longer"; however, the examples he cites from Homer and Pindar do not actually negate its normal meaning of extending only into the future, not the past.</page><page sequence="8">168 E. F. BEALL earlier account.31 It is of course still possible that Hesiod altered a pre-existing ac- count of four entities including the present, such as what Koenen posits because of likenesses he notes (either Egyptian myth or the Atrahasis epic), so drastically as to produce two such disjointed seg- ments.32 However, such schemata have developed in the traditions of many cultures, often including hero-like figures as the most recent group.33 Similarities between them need not imply historical connec- tion. Notably, the Meso-American Popol Vuh also has four past stages prior to a generation related to the present, and its third stage is also related to wood, although historical events which could have con- nected it and Hesiod are at best difficult to envisage.34 Thus the point is not only that description is substituted for "the mythical narration" of vv. 109-74, as Rodriguez Adrados states the issue:35 the very frame of reference is replaced. In short, despite Plato and later interpreters, there is no reason to believe archaic Greece itself thought of 106-201 as a set piece.36 The second issue is the transition from the theory of dike ("jus- tice") ending at v. 285 to the material of 286-380. The latter consti- tutes aphorisms which draw on the late Bronze Age wisdom litera- ture that West stresses as the overall poem's ancestry."3 Some stu- dents begin what they call the second half of the poem with it, pri- marily because it and everything else said thereafter are less theor- etical. Thus as noted earlier, Erbse feels that the diki theory underlies the rest of the poem, evidently meaning to include 286-380 in the latter.38 Hamilton actually argues for this division, but his argument is based on structural symmetries which are not particularly persua- sive.39 Other writers simply assume the second half to begin in the 31 The irony implies a sentiment along the lines of "look what all this history has brought us." (As Russell Hunt (1981) has reminded us, there is humor in this poem.) 32 See Koenen (1994) 17-18 and 20-2, respectively. 33 For a summary treatment, see Hiltebeitel (1990) 48-59. He notes (28) that in the Indian case the Bharata War is an episode between the third and fourth ages (contra Clay's (2003) 81 belief that the Oriental parallels lack heroes). 34 For a translation of the Popol Vuh and commentary, see Tedlock (1996). 35 See Rodriguez Adrados (2001) 217. 36 A corollary is that exegeses of "the narrative's" subtext, such as the Vernant Structuralist interpretation (for which see Clay (2003) 81-3), interpret a post-Hesiodic entity. 37 See West (1978) 25-30. As to that, Rodriguez Adrados (2001) 203-4 notes that several genres apart from epic and wisdom contribute to the Hesiodic poems in gen- eral, including lyric for the Works and Days in particular. 38 See esp. Erbse (1993) 16. 39 That is, Hamilton (1989) claims (60-1) that the beginning is emphatic; notes (61) the repetition of material before v. 286 after it; and argues (61-4) that a "strong formal closure" marks ending there. However, the poem has many emphatic lines which are not beginnings, and all the repeated forms he cites occur first before 105, simply sug- gesting that the mythical reflection noted above (n. 11) occurs within 109-380 as well</page><page sequence="9">HESIOD'S TREATISE ON JUSTICE 169 neighborhood of 286 as if it were not an issue.40 But vv. 286-380 actually specify 202-85, and so are part of an overall portion containing them. As Nelson says of some of the later maxims, they "are about the way human beings ought to behave. That is to say, they are about justice.""41 Indeed, the specification begins with the important example of the need for labor. As noted earlier, Erbse counters the tendency to think of justice and work separately by saying that the poet under- stands work to be included in justice in a general way.42 However, the connection is more than general: it proceeds via a specific inter- pretation of the theoretical portion's central metaphor. That is, the nominal addressee Perses hears near the beginning of the theory sec- tion that he should heed justice and not engage in hubris, because the latter is a burden (vv. 213-6a), and that he should instead pursue the hodos ("road") to dike, because it will win in the long run (216b-8). This road figure is then fleshed out by speaking of Horkos (Oath) racing with crooked judgments and of Dike herself traveling to seek punishment of those who violated her (219-24). But later, when the poet spells out the moral teaching in less abstract terms, he begins by saying that he is speaking to Perses (286), and then offers: TilV tElV TOt KCGKiOTTTC KCGL Lic (TTV oG0t O80' 6piyXLr [Plato: XEiofl] 606;, LiXca 6' 4YY/O vcaLEL TT" 6' aPETf3 'LpW)Ta EOL oirpoTrdpotOEv OflKaV, See, what is wretched is indeed caught in numbers easily: the hodos (to it) is short [Plato: smooth], and it lies close by; but before (getting to) arete the gods have placed sweat, (287-9) along a hoimos which is long and steep, although it eases at its end (290-2).43 As Charles Beye observes, this road metaphor is associated as thereafter. As he himself notes (62), the closure of his first part is clearest within 202-75 (cf. below), and the aspects of it which incorporate earlier material seem to me to be either too general to prove anything or, again, to show mythical reflection al- ready within 109-380. 40 So, e.g., Lardinois (2003) 5. 41 See Nelson (1998) 132; cf. Heath (1985) 250-1. 42 See Erbse (1993) 27-8. 43 Where hoimos actually becomes hodos via gender change in a pronoun (so West 1978 ad loc.).

BEALL with that involving dike.44 Indeed, it gives the figure an earthier im- age: physical exertion via the hoimos is how one actually attains the quality of arete (which seems related to the dike concept that has been the topic).45 Moreover, the material of vv. 286-380 is distinct from that after 383 because, while not as theoretical as 202-85, it is still not as con- crete as the later portion.46 For example, one has neighbors over to dinner in general (342-3, for reasons given in the sequel), but your own picnic has a specified time and menu (589-96). The point ap- plies in particular to parallels which have been alleged between ma- terial within 286-380 and the later injunctions within 695-764 as if a common genre were exemplified.47 Rather, material such as when not to trim fingernails (742-3) is so concrete as to suggest catalogue poetry, not wisdom literature.48 III. The justice treatise: purport. What one notices about the first of the three sections of this es- say, the past races, is an implied relation between each race's mem- bers' behavior and its destiny. Thus, to Nelson each "finds the fate appropriate to it."49 That is too much to say, but the poet does what he can to make it so with the traditional material available, and given his own prejudices. That is to say, the tranquil life of the first race (vv. 112-15) was matched by the tranquil death of its members (116). The second's bad behavior, in particular failing to duly honor the gods (136-7), caused Zeus to destroy the entire race (137-8), although it has been held that it is inconsistent to honor the spirits of such problematic creatures (141-2).5o The third's war-like propensities led it to kill it- 44 See Beye (1972) 41-2. To be sure, I do not agree with him that the later image reflects "inexorability" more than does the earlier. 45 Hesiod might mean dike and arete as cause and effect, respectively. Arthur Ad- kins (1960) 70-3 denies a relation, but presumes without reason that he was thinking of the association of success and arete while composing. 46 I take vv. 381-2 to form a transition segment. As even Nicolai (1964) 87 ac- knowledges, it is not solely assignable either to its antecedent or to its sequel. 47 E.g., Benardete (1967) 166-7 says the first segment is a set of maxims about "property"; the second, "propriety;" cf. Bona Quaglia (1973) 191-227; Hamilton (1989) 73-6. 48 Catalogue poetry was prominent in Greece and the Near East; see Rodriguez Adrados (2001) 204. There is also a stylistic point: the earlier material is largely com- posed in single-line aphorisms; the later, in couplets. Moreover, Clay (2003) 47 is able to find actual disagreements between the two sets. 49 See Nelson (1998) 70; cf. Ada Neschke, in Blaise, Judet de la Combe and Rous- seau (1996) 465-78. 50 Luciana Bona Quaglia (1973) 99-103 especially points out the contradiction. But Marie-Christine Leclerc (1993) 116-17 says there is no "moral significance" here, just a</page><page sequence="11">HESIOD'S TREATISE ON JUSTICE 171 self off, in an impressive segment using several epic expressions which normally accrue to a single hero's death (152-5).51 Thus one effect is to generalize the point that war leads to death. On the other hand, the allusions to epic in describing the third race give an overtone of glory to the end of creatures who amounted to monsters (vv. 145-9). Then after these references the poet posits the fourth race as, indeed, the epic heroes of Thebes and Troy. Here it is little noticed that, although this race was dikaioteros kai areio^n, "more just and (thus) better" (158), its actual description is ambiva- lent.52 The text says the fourth race fell to polemos te kakos kai phulopis aine, "baneful war and dire battle" (161), a phrase with a negative connotation in epic (cf. II. 4.15) as well as in its supervision by our own bad Eris (14), while the fact that one group was killed at Troy "for the sake of" Helen (heneka, 165) may recall Achilles's complaint that he has already fought much "for the sake of" other men's wives (9.327). Of course, if this does not argue for the heroes being "better," it is consistent with the anti-war attitude of the mythological preface. For all that, Zeus does grant the heroes a pleasant afterlife (166-73, with 169 spurious).53 In short, Hesiod's instinct is to learn what is useful from the past, granted that there could be no objective historiography or social sci- ence in his milieu.54 Inparticular he hints that behavior has conse- quences, if without stating this in so many words (such as an aetiol- ogy: "therefore justice and injustice have been rewarded and pun- ished, respectively, ever since"). The second, quasi- rophetical section indeed suggests Amos or Isaiah, at least at first.55 Hesiod says that this "race of iron" will be statement of proximity to the gods. More pragmatically put, Clay (2003) 89-90 may be right that the honor is to problematic forces that might harm one without it. 51 See West (1978) and Verdenius (1985) ad loc. for details. 52 Hesiod scholars for the most part have simply taken the race's stated goodness at face value (e.g., West (1978) 173; cf. 190-4), but on the ambivalence cf. the historian Frank Manuel (1971) 72-3, and now Most (1997) 118. Also, Marsilio (personal com- munication to me) observes that Hesiod uses areio^n in a metrically defined verse loca- tion both here for the heroes and later (v. 207) for the hawk's self-description; Hesiod's treatment there is basically ironic (see below, n. 62), so that it may be here as well. 53 I assume here that all the heroes have the stated afterlife, notwithstanding Clay (2003) 93 and the objections of Verdenius (1985) ad 167 based on logic, i.e., on the point that many heroes went, rather, to Hades. Hesiod may simply have forgotten this while composing. In any case, at least one group of heroes has the blessing. 54 For a review of that question in the context of our concern here, see Rosen- meyer (1957) 257-60. 55 On the long noticed resemblance to Hebrew prophecy, see most recently Sey- bold and von Ungern-Sternberg (1993). Koenen (1994) 14-17 stresses, rather, Egyptian prophecy.</page><page sequence="12">172 E. F. BEALL characterized by toil, misery, and god-given trouble (vv. 176-8). He then says that there will be some good mixed in (179), and that Zeus will destroy the race when its members are gray-haired at birth (180-1).56 It is usually assumed that the cited good is something of- fered to ameliorate the bleak pessimism.57 However, whatever that might be is not specified in our text, and surely it is natural to inter- pret what is good as Zeus's act of destruction itself, a wry comment to the effect that the people will get what they deserve. In any case, a litany of ills follows. Father and children will be estranged, and so guest and host, and brother and brother, and "justice" will be a mat- ter of who is the strongest; "oath," of who is skilful at perjury (182- 94). But Zeus's promised destruction of the race is essentially self- destruction.

That is, we will lose the ability even to feel concern about the perversion of family and social relations which has just been pre- dicted, a sure way to destroy ourselves. However, as with the Hebrew prophets (in a non- Fundamentalist exegesis), that was a warning, not an inevitability. The third section of the treatise offers the means for preventing the 56 West (1978) 176 notes turning gray by age sixteen in one of the alleged Oriental parallels; however, Hesiod could have got the idea anywhere since premature aging as punishment is a folklore motif; see Thompson (1955-58) Vol. 5, 250. Thomas Falk- ner (1989) 58 connects the grayness to these being "iron" people. 57 So most recently Clay (2003) 83. 58 It is noted (e.g., by Gagarin (1990) 174, 182 n. 13) that while zilos is negative here, it is positive at v. 23. A common interpretation (e.g., Verdenius (1985) ad 23, 195) is that it is simply ambiguous. That may be, but the earlier citation does not help any assertion that 11-105 form a thematically consistent introduction to the poem. 59 Cf. the opening line of a notable 20th century poem, Allen Ginsberg's Howl: "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical na- ked." (The parallel may be more than coincidence: Ginsberg is known to have been inspired by Walt Whitman, who was arguably influenced by the Works and Days.)</page><page sequence="13">HESIOD'S TREATISE ON JUSTICE 173 outcome of the second, even as it spells out the relation between be- havior and fate which had been suggested tacitly in the first. Hesiod begins the theoretical portion of this solution by promis- ing certain kings a fable, phroneousi kai autois ("and they will under- stand it," v. 202), to introduce the narrative of the hawk and night- ingale (203-12).6o I believe the cited phrase means the narrative is, not Hesiod's fable as most scholars construe it, i.e., something for the kings to take to heart as a lesson offered to them, but rather an ex- pression of what they themselves think, i.e., their fable.61 The hawk says it is pointless, indeed, disgraceful to protest against its grip (207-11), i.e., might is right, the attitude rulers have toward the ruled. In that way the segment plays a structural role, casting the negatives about diki being a matter of who is strongest stated a few lines earlier (189-93) in a contemporary light, and thereby making a relatively smooth transition from a prophetic future to the actual present-future. But in structural terms it also looks forward: Hesiod closes the theoretical discussion with an answer to the hawk, saying that Zeus gave humans dike so that they would not have to feed upon one another (276-80).62 In the interim the poet gives a series of striking images to argue the efficacy of dike: the idea of a race with hubris and related material noted above; a comparison of the fates of cities whose leaders do and do not practice dike, respectively; a direct address to the kings which says that immortal, invisible guardians watch them on Zeus's behalf; a statement that Dike sits by her father Zeus's knee and tells on those who give crooked judgments (Hesiod's one concession to anthropo- morphism in this section); and a claim that "the eye of Zeus" (Dios ophthalmos) sees all and knows all, including what kind of dike a city 60 For entry to the literature, see Erbse (1993) 12-13; Arrighetti (1998) 423-5; Nel- son (1998) 194 nn. 78-80; Clay (2003) 39 n. 26. 61 Or as Erbse (1993) 14 puts it, "the judges the poet has in view are like wild beasts." One might put the point in terms of narratology following recent Homeric studies. Irene de Jong (1996) 313-15 observes that words like phroneousi can mark a focalization to a viewpoint embedded in the primary narrative, which in this case would be that of the kings. On the strengths and weaknesses of this formalism, see Pucci (2003). 62 This point is widely recognized; see recently Arrighetti (1998) 423; Clay (2003) 42. Nelson (1998) 78 rejects it, but on the basis of Hesiod intending the fable as his own view. Indeed, the discussion's conclusion reveals its beginning as not intended seri- ously, and there are already indications of this in the beginning itself. For example, as Marsilio (above, n. 52) also reminds me, it has long been noted that the first line of the hawk's speech recalls epic usage, as attested in particular in Athena's boast to Ares at II. 21.410, whereas putting such words in the mouth of a mere animal surely does not preserve their divine or aristocratic aura. Apart from these aspects, I also believe that the nightingale introduces the voiced creatures cited in the works and days proper; see Beall (2004c) 104-5.</page><page sequence="14">174 E. F. BEALL practices (vv. 213-69).63 A coda wryly remarks that the poet would not be dikaios, nor would a son of his be such, if the unjust had (what was thought to be) the greater dike, but that he supposes Zeus will not allow such a state (270-3). Given the earlier prophecy that Zeus would destroy the race when the state occurred (180-94), the vision here is indeed a positive alternative. It is best to avoid the temptation to interpret the concept of dike thus treated before noting its exemplification in concrete terms. As observed earlier, the poet makes the connection to practice by speci- fying the "road" figure to one featuring sweat (vv. 286-92). He will say that this means work-after all, warriors will also perspire from swordplay undertaken to reach their own arete. But first, since the issue seems important Hesiod reminds Perses why he should listen. He who understands all is "entirely the best" (panaristos); is at least "noble" (esthlos) if he listens to good advice; but is worthless if nei- ther (293-7).64 As Graziano Arrighetti observes, this assertion is to be contrasted with the Homeric concept of respect based on age.65 My- thologically, it has been noticed that the exemplars recall Prome- theus who had foresight and Epimetheus who only learned later.66 I take it this shows that the justice treatise as well as the works and days reflect the values of the mythological preface. In any case, the segment is effective even if it might have been more logical to put it earlier.67 That is so in particular because the poet next delineates the sweat image ad nauseam: Perses is to work to avoid famine, work to avoid opprobrium, work to fill his barn, etc. (298-316), so that there is "no respite from the hammering repetition of the p'py- root."68 (It is as if the principle of form following content required describing boredom boringly.) Stress on taking advice was surely needed to get any listener to sit through this diatribe. Thus we see that Erbse's Ansatz mentioned earlier is indeed 63 As to anthropomorphism, cf. II. 1.500 (Thetis sits by Zeus's knee to raise her particular problem with him); 5.869 (Ares). As Verdenius (1985) observes ad 259, Dike's complaint is more a matter of principle. Daniele Aubriot (1984), noting the parallel between Dike and other "daughters of Zeus," the Litai ("Prayers") of II. 9.505- 15 who should be honored lest they complain to him, argues that Dike's role is clearer than theirs; cf. Schmidt (1986) 129-31. 64 However, v. 294 (a gloss on 293) is sometimes questioned, as Verdenius (1985) notes ad loc. Indeed, the verse structure is more satisfying without it, and it is hardly "essential" to the argument as Verdenius thinks. 65 See Arrighetti (1998) ad 293-7; cf. Verdenius (1985) ad 295, who notes the case of Nestor expecting to be heeded (II. 1.254-84, esp. 273-4). 66 So, e.g., Nelson (1998) 65-6, construing Epimetheus simply as not thinking. But the correspondence is with all three exemplars if he is seen as, rather, a two-sided figure: not learning at first, but doing so later; see Beall (1991) 364 n. 47. 67 Cf. Verdenius (1985) ad 293-7. 68 So West (1978) ad 309.</page><page sequence="15">HESIOD'S TREATISE ON JUSTICE 175 borne out. Justice is all the poet needs in order to explain the impera- tive to work. And there is little question that this work, as portrayed here, is to be expected to be hard.69 All that is needed is the complement, that not working means in- justice. That is indeed implied next, but the point turns out to supply a connection to other particulars. The poet impugns not working in the form of (the bad type of) shame, vv. 317-19, but then says that its opposite, boldness, is not to be employed for robbery or fraud (320- 6). He then proscribes other misbehaviors, but an epic parallel probably will have brought specifically the first two of them to his mind. He says that if a man acquires wealth wrongly the gods waste the estate CIVpt Tyc, TTaUPOV 84 T' iSrr Xp6vov 6,Xos bOTrl6E UTov 6' 0s 0' LKTT.V is TE EItVOV KKOV E"pEL 0s TE KLY'PVyTOLO EOU UVl 86E[vLCa 3CLVTi of the man, and little is the time wealth accompanies him.

But there are a number of examples where material in our poem is so close to an attested epic passage that it is difficult to deny a direct connection.70 And in one of them, Alcinous cites a proverb by way of telling the Phaeacians to treat Odysseus well: C1VTL KatLYVjITOU ELVO 0' LKETT] TE TETUKTCLtL ctVEPL, O; T' 9)0yoXl T'Ep 1 7TlEtalJ1 TrpactT'86E(CTL. A guest or a suppliant is like a brother to a man who is one with even a little range of wit. (Od. 8.546-7) Thus it is not merely that these two passages are examples of "classic 69 This portrayal is at odds with the mood of much of the actual works and days; see Beall (2005) n. 60. 70 In addition to some noted earlier herein, see Beall (2004a) 10 n. 30 and 23 for two others. The possibility cannot be absolutely ruled out that the Homeric saying in such a case was not in the epic tradition available to Hesiod, but resulted from Homer alluding to the Hesiodic case (in a hypothesis some entertain of a final redaction of Homer's poem after ours). However, and as to yet another case, our vv. 609-10 as compared with Od. 5.121, metrical considerations make it likelier that Hesiod's use was the later; see Beall (2005) n. 20.</page><page sequence="16">176 E. F. BEALL sins," as West puts it:71 they are specifically connected. To be sure, our poet may have thought the Homeric couplet particularly rele- vant, because the hiketes and the xeinos were liable to suffer theft.72 From there, although West asserts that Hesiod is "free- wheeling," he gives a series of artful mini-essays which are ordered in a coherent manner, each composed largely of single-line apho- risms, of which some have attested Near East roots but are put into epic language.73 They treat proper relations with the gods; with neighbors; giving and receiving; and guarding what is stored (vv. 335-75). Finally, a thought about not letting a woman lower your guard naturally suggests progeny (376-80),74 to finish exemplifying dike with a look to the future. IV. Hesiod's dike. Evidently the first two sections of this treatise, the past and a possible negative future, respectively, are introductory to the third, the need to follow dike. As to this concept, two issues have been prominent.75 The first concerns its range of reference. In the 1970s Gagarin wrote two articles which argued to the effect that in Homer and Hesiod alike, dike is a narrowly juridical concept as opposed to a broadly ethical one. Although most writers have followed Matthew Dickie's criticism of this thesis, Nelson has now upheld it insofar as she claims that Hesiod's actual use of the word dike is "exclusively of the courts," while granting that the passage on practice beginning at v. 286 is about "justice" in the broader sense.76 However, taking poetry seriously dictates accounting for both direct reference and connotation. Hesiod's specific citations of dike 71 See West (1978) ad 327. 72 So Verdenius (1985) ad 327. However, he (ad 328) claims the xeinos here is, rather, a "stranger." 73 Contra West (1978) 45. For useful points about this material, see Friedlander (1913); Verdenius (1962) 143-8; Benardete (1967) 164-5; Bona Quaglia (1973) 193-215; Martin (1992) 25-7; Nelson (1998) 131-4; Beall (2004a) 5 n. 13. 74 Here the citation of an "only child" (mounogends pais, v. 376) together with that of "another child" (hetera paida, 378) has troubled commentators. Some (e.g., Verden- ius (1985) ad 378, 379-80) construe the latter phrase alternatively, and attempt to ex- plain away the new contradiction that then arises with 379-80, which appear to pre- suppose a second child. However, even though otherwise unattested the former ex- pression has the feel of a traditional noun-epithet phrase. As is now well known, that is not a rational sum of its parts, so that, e.g., Homer's "swift-footed horses" some- times lose the race. Thus I posit that the image which mounogenes pais evokes is not so much counterposed to having more sons as to having none at all. 75 On Hesiod's dike, see Adkins (1960) 70-3; Gagarin (1973) and (1974); Claus (1977); Dickie (1978); Havelock (1978) 193-217; Lloyd-Jones (1983) 32-6; Aubriot (1984); Schmidt (1986) 125-35; Erler (1987) 7-22; Sihvola (1989) 49-61; Janko (1992) 364-6 (ad II. 16.384-93); Nelson (1998) 130-8; Clay (2003) 82-3. 76 See Nelson (1998) 130 and 131-3, respectively.</page><page sequence="17">HESIOD'S TREATISE ON JUSTICE 177 directly concern the courts in many cases (not all).77 Still, in these it is nonetheless a synecdoche for justice in the broad sense of the term. There is ample documentation that, especially, the personified Dike Hesiod cites at vv. 213-24 and 256-62 had a general scope to the Greeks.78 And while in principle one might conceive of her as only present near the courts, this cannot be the concept when she wanders the city observing the ways of its people (222). Thus she stands for a general ethical principle. The second issue is the relation of Hesiod's concept to Homer's. A parallel between Dike seeking punishment for being driven out (v. 224) and a simile referent where Zeus sends a flood to punish crooked judgments (II. 16.387-8) is long noticed.79 Then, in the sequel on the fates of peoples who do and do not practice dike, respectively, the first people (225-37) attain such benefits as children resembling their parents and not having to go to sea to make up for insufficient crops. This passage has been recognized since Plato (R. 363b-c) as closely following the simile referent of a ruler who gives his people benefits (Od. 19.109-14). However, aside from sending famine and disease to the second people, Zeus will make their women not just bear questionable young, but barren; their seagoing not just an un- pleasant necessity, but deadly (238-47). Michael Erler seems correct that this theology derives ultimately from the East, where divine in- tervention takes the form of such unnatural events, not from Homer, where it harnesses natural phenomena.80 This is so even though there are also epic language parallels here.81 Also, Homer never sin- gles out dike for treatment.82 Thus Hesiod's idea of dike^ was a development from Homer's, as against the position of Hugh Lloyd-Jones and others that he only 77 Nelson (1998) 217 n. 29 allows an exception only at v. 712. But against her read- ing at 249 see Verdenius (1985) ad loc. Also, she makes a point of noting that Hesiod puts a discussion of perjury in particular just after the statement that animals do not have dikd (274-85), but are we to believe that if they had it this would then render them able to testify in court, be it honestly or no? 78 For references, see West (1966) ad Th. 902; Verdenius (1985) ad 213. 79 So, e.g., Verdenius (1985) ad 224; Janko (1992) 365. 80 See Erler (1987) 15-19. 81 The treatment seems to gloss the epic concept of Zeus's responsibility for jus- tice which the cited Iliad flood narrative embodies. See Verdenius (1985) 134-7 for this and other parallels to vv. 238-47. (Add: for atasthala mdchanaatai at 241, Zeus punishes one who "recklessly schemes," cf. II. 11.695 and six times in Od.) 82 To add a point here I have not seen made previously, Hesiod uses the expres- sion dikd esti at v. 278 to say that animals feed upon one another since "justice is" not among them, but in Homeric usage that phrase only means that some given character- istic "is the way" of a given group (e.g., death is the way of mortals, Od. 11.218; cf. 14.59; 19.43). Only with a soft bed as the way of elders (24.255) does the sense ap- proach that of "right."</page><page sequence="18">178 E. F. BEALL applied the Odyssey's concept to his circumstances.83 Perhaps indeed this is in part because he brought in ideas from outside epic. Although it is less discussed, there is also an ethical/theodical issue. As Arrighetti points out, with Hesiod's dike the idea is clear that humans have a choice between the good (i.e., dikaios) and the bad "roads."84 From this one can derive the more general point that his theodicy is distinctive. It would be wrong to say that dike in the Works and Days is "secular" in the modern sense of the term: its deri- vation from Zeus is amply spelled out in the theoretical section, vv. 213-85. But still, in the last analysis it is left to humans to implement the matter.85 If they do not, what will transpire is not Yahweh send- ing fire and brimstone, but the human-derived principles Shame and Indignation deserting humanity, to leave it defenseless against what is basically it itself (197-201). That is to say, Zeus has so arranged things that "the man who works evil on another works evil on him- self," as Hesiod explicitly says (265; cf. 266). The relation of the dis- cussion of dikj to the rest of the poem may well be that, as Bona Quaglia says, that quality "must always be in the heart of man."86 Still, her further statement that its pursuit makes man "the instru- ment and collaborator of Zeus," thus "perfecting Zeus's glory," makes Hesiod more of a Christian theologian than is warranted.87 But all this is, again, to ignore vv. 286-380. I take it that Hesiod's achievement there is partly literary: he puts late Bronze Age wisdom aphorisms in the service of exemplifying the decidedly Iron Age generalization embodied in the principle of dike^. But as to that prin- ciple's characterization, the reciprocity in social relations Nelson stresses is one important aspect: e.g., give and receive in good meas- ure (349-50).88 Still, it is more than that unless we artificially sever the opening discussion on work and the final two segments on keep- ing stores and on progeny from the section (which would say that the middle exemplifies dik? but not the ends). In reality, to Hesiod dike is nothing less than the set of guiding principles of behavior by which rational, civilized human beings order their lives. 83 See Lloyd-Jones (1983) 35-6; cf. Janko (1992) 365-6. Eric Havelock (1978) 214-17 allows that Hesiod "rationalizes" Homer's dike, but avers that his concept is still one of "process, not principle." 84 See Arrighetti (1998) ad 286-98. This was far from obvious in the mythological part of the poem; see above (n. 15). To be sure, one also understands from the treat- ment that exercising the choice correctly will lead to prosperity. 85 Similarly, Juha Sihvola (1989) 61 says Hesiod does not need "divine inspiration to recognize moral principles." 86 See Bona Quaglia (1973) 155; cf. Erbse (1993) 27-8. 87 See Bona Quaglia (1973) 242. 88 See Nelson (1998) 132-4.</page><page sequence="19">HESIOD'S TREATISE ON JUSTICE 179 V. Conclusion. One traditionally speaks of "Hesiod" as the author of two poems (apart from spurious material), the implication being that "his" out- look is reflected in both, if their distinctive subject matters will make it expressed differently. Thus Clay has now argued for the Theogony and the Works and Days "as complementary visions of the cosmos," despite differences.89 That is, I take it, since the former is myth-based, so must be the latter. But the foregoing treatment has seen the later poem breaking from the outlook of the earlier, in positing the prefacing of the actual works and days by a non-mythical introduction. It is to be sure be- yond the scope of this article to specify just how this material is pre- faced. (It cannot be simply that justice includes work in the sense of drudgery, because the later material is not only about that.)90 Still, perhaps the point will turn out to be along the lines that the poetry of the later material and the life it embodies can be fully experienced only by one who has determined to be just. The basing of society on myth may also be relevant in Hesiod's view.91 Thus he adds a (shorter) mythological preface that does largely follow the earlier poem's outlook, whose motifs recur at various places in the poem proper. Still, if I am right he sees the introduction incorporating dike as what really grounds any piece having to do with life in his times.92 E. F. BEALL Washington, D. C. WORKS CITED Adkins, A. W.
