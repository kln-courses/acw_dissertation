Stevenson, Georgia Lee and F.J. Morin. Los Osos, CA: The Easter Island Foundation 1998. 401 pp, maps, illus, $49.95 (ISBN 188063631) Review by Patrick C. McCoy Hawaii State Department of Land and Natural Resources, Historic Preservation Division The first International Conference on Easter Island and East Polynesia was held in 1984. What started out at that time as a meeting of a small group of pri marily Easter Island specialists (mostly archaeolo gists) has grown into one of the primary venues for scholars in diverse fields of Pacific studies to present and discuss current research. This volume is a col lection of 64 papers and 5 abstracts from the fourth conference, which was held in Albuquerque, New Mexico on August 5-10, 1997 and sponsored by the Easter Island Foundation. The symposium chair man, Christopher Stevenson, notes that one of the primary goals of the conference was to foster a com parative perspective in Easter Island studies by invit ing papers on other areas of the Pacific; hence the title of the conference, "Easter Island in Pacific Context." The result is an eclectic group of papers on a wide range of topics organized into nine sepa rate sections (sessions). Each group of papers has a short introduction by the session organizer and chair. The papers in Session One (East Polynesian Languages and Literature) are very wide ranging, with contributions on everything from string figures to bilingual language choice and the restoration of cultural identity and a sense of 'self' through writ ing. Two papers are on the famous rongorongo script of Easter Island, including one by Steven Fischer, who seems to have stepped back a bit from earlier, widely publicized pronouncements on his succcess in deciphering the script in saying here that the code has been apparently' broken. According to Fischer the scripts are primarily concerned with procreation chants, rather than serving as mnemonic devices as had widely been assumed by a number of other scholars in the past. On current evidence the scripts may have flourished for only three generations or so, from the 1770s or 1780s until the mid-i86os.</page><page sequence="2">The readers of this journal will probably be most interested in the papers in Session Two (Past, Present and Future: Polynesian Art in Context) organized by Carol Ivory. Most of the papers, which exhibit a primary concern with social and historical context, would fit comfortably into the late Alfred Cell's view of an anthropology of art' with its emphasis on the 'doing' aspects of art in the production and repro duction of social relationships. Archaeologists Sidsel Millerstrom and Edmundo Edwards present the results of a study of 81 Marquesan stone statues (tiki) in architectural association, gender, and stylistic variation. Two of the papers illustrate the dynamic, changing aspects of Polynesian art forms in the past and present. Carol Ivory describes a new art form in the Marquesas, painted tapa, and its relationship to traditional bark cloth, which was rarely decorated. Changes in the use of Tongan quilting in gift exchange is the subject of a paper by Hilary Scothorn. The importance of what is called the architectural 'stage' in the performance of public ceremonies is the focal point of a paper by Anne Allen on status, ceremony, and theater in Western Samoa. A comparative perspective is employed in a paper by Deborah Waite, who argues that the social ization of the body in Mangareva was not limited to humans but found a similar emphasis in such art forms as wooden images, offering stands, paddles, and carved sticks where anthropomorphic body parts (e.g. hands) were used to represent social dif ferences and genealogical links with the creators. A similar emphasis on the use of body parts can be seen in Tahitian and Marquesan art. papers in Session Three (Environmental Issues in Rapa Nui and East Polynesia). Good evidence has existed for some time now of significant environ mental change in Easter Island prehistory, but there is still no consensus on the primary causal factors and chronology of deforestation. Some researchers continue to argue that deforestation was primarily due to climatic change, while others attribute the change to the cumulative effects of human activity. Several papers are focused on this on-going debate, which is unlikely to be settled any time soon. Environmental change continues to be a hot issue in Easter Island archaeology as evidenced by the rrnw a * a '• ;«Slfc I l-l V.» tyZ\—■ W 11 o *m ^ ■ '&amp;SU Tattoo motifs carved into Marquesan stone tiki In 1981 George Gill, a physical anthropologist, and his students began what could possibly end up being, due to the increasing sensitivity of studying human remains, one of the last major human oste ology research projects in the Pacific, on Rapa Nui. Six of the seven papers in Session Four (The Human Osteology of Rapa Nui) derive from the 1981 Easter Island Anthropological Expedition. Gill provides a useful introduction to the project and a restatement of his novel hypothesis of Easter Island settlement via the Americas. The other papers are concerned with such issues as population history, and cranio metric variation. Session Five (Archaeological Studies on Rapa Nui and in East Polynesia), contains nine papers on a variety of topics. Easter Island has been something of an exception to the long-standing preoccupation in many areas of Polynesia with research on agricul tural systems. This is changing with some new and important research on one component of the larger agricultural system referred to in two of the papers as 'rock gardens.' Other topics addressed include set tlement patterns, burial practices, Tahitian archery platforms, site photography using kites, and anoth er paper by Thor Heyerdahl on what he believes to be persuasive evidence for the South American ori gins of several Rapa Nui cultural traits. Other than Easter Island, the only other group of papers that focuses on a single island group are those in Session Six, which was titled "Hawaiian Archaeology in the 1990s." One of the most inter esting papers is by Bruce Masse and David Tuggle on the date of the colonization of the Hawaiian Islands, a subject that is now starting to be discussed more frequently in terms of two opposing theories characterized as a "short chronology" and a "long chronology." In addition to a consideration of radio carbon dates and oral traditions, the authors also July 2001 149</page><page sequence="3">consider dated astronomical events. The authors conclude that the bulk of the evidence supports the 'short chronology,' with first settlement circa AD 800. There are other papers on such diverse topics as petroglyphs, a fishhook-manufacturing work shop, the spatial organization of a settlment on Lana'i, and a holua (sled) site on Maui. at the evidence for what he believes was part of a widespread ancient mythological tradition in mar ginal Polynesia. The paper is similar to one published by Terrence Barrow in 1967, which is curiously not mentioned, however. The relationship of the Hawaiian pa'u hula (garments worn in a hula per formance) to mana and kapu and how these rela tionships were affected by changes in fashion is the subject of an interesting paper by Caroline Klarr that uses the 'binding' theories of Bradd Shore and oth ers. The final paper in this group is by Ana Maria Arredondo, who summarizes the evidence concern ing ancient forms of tattooing on Rapa Nui and the practice on the island today. It is hard to overestimate the importance of stone resources to the peoples of the Pacific prior to the introduction of metal. The ten papers in Session Seven (Lithic Resources and Uses of Stone in Oceania), organized by Bill Ayres, provide some evi dence of the importance of these same resources and products to archaeologists. Sourcing studies, which hold great potential to address a variety of research problems, are finally beginning to be applied to rock types other than obsidian on Easter Island. Several papers are concerned with various aspects of sourc ing. Other papers include technological and use wear analyses of flake tools, studies of petroglyph deterioration, and problems related to the restora tion of Easter Island's famous stone statues. The other group of papers that will probably most interest the readers of this journal are those in Session Eight (Body Ornamentation in the Pacific), which are geographically focused on eastern and marginal Polynesia (Rapa Nui, Hawai'i, and New Zealand). The interest in body ornamentation is part of a larg er concern with the body in all of its myriad aspects. Tricia Allen contributes to the growing literature on tattooing in a paper on the function of the tattooed hand in Hawai'i. She argues that it was a function of the kapu system and that in the case of women a tat tooed hand permitted contact with persons and/or things imbued with mana. The birdman cult is the subject of a paper by Leonard Barrow, which looks Petroglyphs from Hawai'i and Rapa Nui The most eclectic group of papers are those in Session Nine (Contemporary and Historical Aspects of Polynesian Culture). There are papers on colonialism, education, migration, the William Mulloy library, tourism, globalization, and tradi tional Easter Island medicine. The paper by Grant McCall, a long-time Easter Island scholar, is sure to raise some eyebrows in his 'wild surmise' that the Rapanui were involved in a wide ranging trade net work that included the Americas. McCall even goes so far as to say that Heyerdahl's theory of Rapa Nui settlement did not go far enough! It is of interest to note that since this paper was presented some of the physical anthropologists, whose data formed an im portant part of McCall's hypothesis, have backed away from their earlier claims of New World contact. In a volume containing this many contributions there is a predictable unevenness in the quality of the papers. This shortcoming aside, this is a publi cation that should be in every library with a Pacific collection. It is a publication that any serious stu dent of the Pacific would also want to possess. The editors are to be congratulated for producing such a large volume so quickly. As to the primary confer ence goal of expanding the vision of Easter Island researchers, I suspect that those who already read widely and employ a comparative approach will continue to do so, while those who don't and are not interested in developing theoretical generalizations will continue to work as they see fit. There is cer tainly a place in this reviewer's opinion for both gen eralizing and particularizing studies. The biggest mistake would be to assume that Easter Island pre history could be explained or understood in terms of a small number of evolutionary generalizations. 150 Pacific Arts</page></plain_text>
