<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Boundary System and Political Status of Gaza under the Assyrian Empire By Nadav Na'aman Gaza (Gazze) is mentioned for the first time in the annals of Thutmose III, and it was the main Egyptian centre in Canaan in the Late Bronze Age. Later, in the early Iron Age, it became the capital of a kingdom under its own ruler (cf. the sor?nim in biblical historiog raphy, e.g. Josh 13,3). The history of Gaza in the first quarter of the first millennium b.c.e., before the arrival of the Assyrians, is practically unknown, but the city must have kept its independence for hundreds of years, except possibly for short periods of subjection to neigh bouring powers (e.g., Aram Damascus under Hazael). Its political status compared to its neighbours is indicated by the prophecy of Amos against the Philistine kingdoms (Amos 1,6-8), which denounces only Gaza, while the punishment falls on all four kingdoms (Gaza, Ashdod [Isd?d], Ashkelon [(Asqal?n] and Ekron [Hirbet el-MuqannacIT?l Miqn?]). Thus, Gaza was probably the most important Philistine kingdom in the mid-eighth century b.c.e. When Tiglath-pileser III reached Philistia in 734 b.c.e. Gaza had been an established king dom for about 400 years, with its own regime, administrative and religious institutions (for surveys of the history of Gaza, see Stark 1852; Mayer 1907; Eph?al 1971; Katzenstein 1992; Ovadiah 1993; Ehrlich 1996; Humbert 2000). The available documents make it possible to sketch an outline of the history of Gaza from the Assyrian conquest on, but the data are open to different interpretations. Some fundamental problems are debated among scholars. For example: the status of the kingdom of Gaza under Assyrian rule; the kingdom's borders; the scope of the Assyrian intervention in its internal affairs; the relation between Gaza's rulers and the tribal leaders situated near its borders; and finally, the changes in its political status between the Assyrian withdrawal from Palestine (late 630s or early 620s b.c.e.) and the Persian conquest of Egypt (about 525 b.c.e.). To investigate these problems we have documentary and archaeological evidence. There are diverse documents - including Assyrian, Babylonian and Greek texts, epigraphic inscrip tions from south Palestine, and the Bible. The archaeological evidence is known from exca vations and surveys (see recently yezerski 2003). The long delay in publishing many ex cavations and surveys conducted in southern Palestine and northern Sinai, the results of which are known only from preliminary reports and summary articles, is a serious obstacle to research. Another obstacle is that the Tell of ancient Gaza, located in the middle of the modern city, has been occupied uninterruptedly for thousands years and is covered by modern buildings (see Phythian-adams 1923). It is therefore practically impossible to excavate the site of ancient Gaza. In what follows I will try to clarify some of the above-mentioned problems, opening the discussion with Tiglath-pileser's 734 campaign to Philistia, which started a new era in the history of Gaza after hundreds years of relative stability. zdpv 120 (2004) 1</page><page sequence="2">56 Nadav Na'aman Gaza in the Inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III According to the Eponym Chronicle, the first Assyrian campaign to the coast of Philistia took place in the year 734 b.c.e. The campaign aimed to block the possible approach of an Egyptian task force to Philistia, and took the anti-Assyrian coalition headed by Rezin of Damascus by surprise ( a a 1991, 92-93). The annals describing the events of that year have not yet been found, but three summary inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III (Summ. 4, 8 and 9) relate in similar phrases the campaign conducted against Gaza in that year (see the synoptic table in Tadmor 1994, 222-225). The Gaza episode as related in Summ. 4 may be restored as follows (Spieckermann 1982, 325-330; Tadmor 1994, 138-141 lines 8-15; a5a a 1999a, 401-402; Frahm 1997/98, 403 ad p. 188-189): "Hanunu of Gaza, [who] fle[d before] my weapons and escaped [to] Egypt - Gaza, [his royal city, i conquered. His people], his goods and [his] gods [i despoiled. An imag]e [of the great] gods, my [lords], and my royal image [i fashioned of gold and set up] in the palace [of Gaza]. i counted (them) among the gods of their land, and established [th]eir [regular offerings?]. As for [him (/. e., Hanunu), the fear of my majesty] overwhelmed him and like a bird he flew [from Egypt...]. i returned him to his position, [The city of Gaza i turned] into [an Assyrian] emp[orium. Gold], silver, multi-coloured garments, linen garments, large [horses, ... i re]ceived." According to the three summary inscriptions, Hanunu of Gaza fled to Egypt and the Assyrian king entered the city, erected his stele in the palace, carried its booty to Assyria and imposed payment of an annual tribute. Hanunu, who fled to Egypt, returned and submitted to Tiglath pileser. He was restored to the throne and became an Assyrian vassal. An Assyrian emporium was established at Gaza in order to control the maritime commerce with Egypt and the Levant (Tadmor 1994, 222-225; Ehrlich 1996, 94-98, with earlier literature; a a 2001, 260-261). The authors of Summ. 8-9 combined the taking of the booty and the payment of tribute in one passage, whereas the author of Summ. 4 kept them separate. In the first part of the episode he mentioned the booty (people, valuable goods and statues of gods), and in the second part he listed the tribute. The "gods" (Hani) are probably the ancestral gods of Ha nunu, rather than Gaza's cult statues ( a'a a 1999a, 401-404; for a different interpreta tion, see uehlinger 2002, 109-115). The deportation probably included members of the royal family (tadmor 1994, 176 line 15) and statues of the royal house of Gaza, all of which were transferred to Assyria in order to secure the loyalty of Gaza's king. Retaining the statues of royal houses was an effective step that could secure loyalty. Whether the despoiled statues were eventually returned remains unknown1. The removal of the gods from Gaza is juxtaposed in Summ. 4 with the transfer to Gaza of a golden image (probably a golden plaque in the form of a stele) of the Assyrian king and the symbols of the Assyrian gods2. This image was established in the palace of Gaza, where a 1 Tiglath-pileser's policy towards Gaza may be compared to that of Sennacherib towards Ashkelon. After the conquest of the city in 701 b.c.e., Sennacherib deported the rebellious king (Sidqa), some members of his family, and "the gods of his (/'. e., $idqa) father's house" (Oppenheim 1969, 287b). 2 Formally, the texts of Summ. 4,10 and 8,17 refer to two images and must be translated in the plural. However, the author was probably describing a golden plaque in the form of a stele, on which were depicted the king and the symbols of the great gods of Assyria, similar in form to the statues erected by the Assyrian kings. The plural form was necessary in order to juxtapose the deported statues with the new golden image set in the palace (see Tadmor 1994, 177 note 16; Uehlinger 1997, 310). ZDPV 120 (2004) 1</page><page sequence="3">The Boundary System and Political Status of Gaza under the Assyrian Empire 57 chapel was probably built for it and regular offerings made. The statue must have been a reminder to the king of Gaza who held the real power. In the context of the inscriptions, the Assyrian image(s) set up in the palace took the place of the statues deported from Gaza to Assyria. Tiglath-pileser's most detailed summary inscription (Summ. 8) mentions a campaign to the Brook of Egypt (Nahal Musur), and the setting up of a royal image immediately after the conquest of Gaza (tadmor 1994, 178 line 18). The toponym umna-hal mu-sur is followed in the text by the apposition 'river' (n?[ru]). Thus, it is evident that the text refers to a river (the Brook of Egypt), not to a place called "the city of the Brook of Egypt", as some scholars suggested (e.g., Alt 1945, 129-131; 1953, 157; Ephcal 1982, 30.37.93.104; Tadmor 1994, 178 note 18). The river's name, the Brook of Egypt, indicates that from the northern view point it was considered as the border of Palestine, and that the desert area on its southwest and west was considered an Egyptian territory (see Na'aman 1986, 237-251). On the basis of Tiglath-pileser's description of the Gaza episode, in particular the setting of a royal image in the palace and the establishment of an Assyrian emporium, cogan (1993, 407) suggested that Gaza had "a political status beyond regular vassaldom but not yet full incorporation as a province". However, there is no indication of Gaza's exceptional political or administrative status in documents written in the time of later Assyrian rulers. I have recently suggested that Assyrian intervention in the territories of vassal kingdoms was the norm rather than the exception. The establishment of an Assyrian emporium at Gaza has parallels in building projects carried out by Assyrian rulers in other vassal kingdoms in the Levant (i.e., Ashdod, Tyre, Sidon, Arvad, Edom, and possibly Byblos, Judah and Moab) (Finkelstein/Singer-Avitz 2001; a'a a 2001). Moreover, the practice of setting As syrian royal images with the symbols of the gods of Assyria in palaces and temples of vassal kings is well documented in the Assyrian royal inscriptions (Yamada 2000, 295-297; see Spieckermann 1982, 322-344). Yamada (2000, 296-270) suggested that the image with symbols of the gods served for the swearing of the oath and as a witness to honoring the oath imposed on the ruler and the local elite. cole and machinist (1998, XIV-XV.XXIII notes 26-30) further noted that royal divine images functioned as an object of oath. We may conclude that Gaza's treatment was not uncommon, and that there is no evidence of the kingdom's exceptional status among the Assyrian vassals in the Levant. Gaza in the Inscriptions of Sargon II After his victory over Hamath and its allies (720 b.c.e.), Sargon led his troops towards Philistia (for references, see Fuchs 1994, 437 sub voce H?zutu; Oppenheim 1969, 285). Unlike Tiglath-pileser's campaign of 734 b.c.e., on this occasion Egyptian troops crossed the Sinai Peninsula and came to the aid of Hanunu, king of Gaza. The Assyrian army won the battle near Raphia (Refah), the Egyptian task force retreated to Egypt, and Hanunu was taken into captivity and deported to Assyria. Sargon destroyed the city of Raphia, seized "9033 people together with their many possessions" and deported them to Assyria (fuchs 1994, 90 lines 54-57; Oppenheim 1969, 285). Gaza's new king is not named in Sargon's inscriptions. Since Silli-Bel, the king of Gaza who is mentioned for the first time in Sennacherib's 701 b.c.e. campaign, was still in power in 667 (Streck 1916, 140-142 line 28), it was probably his unnamed predecessor who zdpv 120 (2004) 1</page><page sequence="4">58 Nadav Na5aman succeeded Hanunu on the throne of Gaza. The contributions paid by Gaza and related matters are mentioned three times in the Assyrian documents of the time of Sargon II: 1. A letter of the time of Sargon (ND 2765 lines 33-46) runs as follows (Postgate 1974, 117-118; Deller 1985, 329-330; Weippert 1987, 100 note 36, with earlier literature; Parp?la 1987 no. 110; Saggs 2001, 219-221): "I have received 45 horses of the [lan]d?. The emissaries of Egypt, Gaza, Judah, Moab and Ban Ammon entered Calah on the twelfth, with their tribute in their hands. 24 horses of the (emissary) of Gaza in his hand. The (emissaries of) Edom, Ashdod and Ekron [went o]ut? [of i]t? ([TA? MUR]UB4 [??-su? ]-u-ni)." The governor of Calah reports to the king first that the emissaries of some western kingdoms, including Egypt, had arrived in Calah and brought horses as gifts to the As syrian court. Secondly, he informs the king that the Gaza envoy had brought an extra delivery of 24 horses, either as a special gift, or his deficit from the previous year3. Thirdly, he mentions that the envoys of Edom, Ashdod and Ekron, who must have arrived in Calah earlier, possibly with a gift of horses, had left the city. The letter was sent to Marduk-remani, the provincial governor of Calah. Since another governor was in office in 712, it was written before this date (Deller 1985, 330; 1987, 219). 2. According to an Assyrian administrative document (ND 2672), the ruler of Gaza dis patched 17 horses (postgate 1974, 388-389 lines 24-35). The horses must have been of the breed known in the Assyrian documents as mat K?sayu, i. e., 'Nubian' (Postgate 1974, 11). They were delivered to Addu-hati, governor of Subat-Hamath in the time of Sargon II (postgate 1974, 382 note 2)4. 3. A tablet from Fort Shalmaneser (ND 10078) records the distribution of wine (dalley/ Postgate 1984 no. 135; Deller 1985, 328-330; Weippert 1987, 100 note 36). Among the recipients are delegates from Palestinian kingdoms, who received the wine on two occasions. The envoys of Ashdod, Edom, Gaza and Judah received wine at an "early time" (p?niutu); and the envoys of Ashdod (KUR Sa-du-d[u-a-a])5, Judah, Edom, Ekron and Ban-Ammon (and possibly others; the tablet breaks at this place), received it on a "later" occasion (urk?utu). The tablet should be dated to the time of Sargon II (deller 1985, 328-329), and it is possible that these delegations are referred to in tablet ND 2765. 4. In a letter discovered at Nineveh (ABL 568), Sennacherib, the crown prince, informs his father, Sargon II, of the contributions received from two cities, and their distribution among dignitaries of the royal Assyrian court (Martin 1936, 40-49; postgate 1974, 111.283-284; parpola 1987, 35-36 no. 34). A closely related list of contributions received from Ashkelon appears in ND 2672 (see above). In light of the close similarity of the dispatches mentioned in ND 2672 and ABL 568, it is evident that the latter contri butions were sent by Philistine cities, one of which must have been Ashkelon. As de 3 For the king of Ashkelon paying to Assyria the deficit of the former year, see postgate 1974, 387 line 3. 4 For references to his correspondence, see Parp?la 1987, 233 sub voce Adda-hati. For the province of Subat-Hamath, see Na'aman 1999b, 421-429. 5 The name of Ashdod is written in two different forms in the Assyrian texts, i. e., Asdudu and Sadudu. See Weippert 1987, 100 note 36; Ephcal 1999, 5-6.

According to the Nineveh Prism of Sargon, in 711 b.c.e. the Ashdodites tried in vain to induce some Assyrian vassals (the kings of Philistia, Judah, Edom and Moab) to rebel against Assyria (Fuchs 1998, 46 lines 25-28; Oppenheim 1969, 287). The designation "kings of Philistia" {sarr?ni mat Piliste) refers to the three kingdoms of Gaza, Ashkelon and Ekron, described in the prism as "payers of tribute and gifts to Ashur, my lord", /. e.y loyal Assyrian vassals. Gaza under the Late Assyrian and Babylonian Empires The city of Gaza is not mentioned in the description of Sennacherib's campaign to Palestine, either in the list of tribute payers near Sidon, or in the description of the fighting (frahm 1997, 53-55 lines 32-60; 58-59; Oppenheim 1969, 287-288). However, Silli-Bel, king of Gaza, is mentioned among the Philistine rulers to whom Sennacherib assigned Judahite ter ritories at the close of the campaign (Luckenbill 1924, 33 line 34; see 70 line 30; Oppen heim 1969, 288). Taking into account the strategic position of Gaza on the way to Egypt, and the fact that an Egyptian task force crossed Philistia on its way to Eltekeh, we may assume that Gaza was forced to participate in the anti-Assyrian alliance, and that Egyptian troops were stationed in the city7. When the Egyptian task force retreated, the king of Gaza surren dered to Assyria, and like other Philistine rulers (/. e., Padi of Ekron and Sharru-lu-dari of Ashkelon), whose kingdoms had been forced to take part in the anti-Assyrian coalition, was treated favourably and received some territories detached from the kingdom of Judah. In 695 b.c.e., the king of Gaza dispatched to Nineveh a tribute of 1 talent of silver (Fales/Post gate 1995, 43 no. 54). Silli-Bel is listed in the inscriptions of Esarhaddon among the Palestinian and Cypriot Assyrian vassals who were mobilized for work in the construction of Nineveh (borger 1956, 60 line 57; Oppenheim 1969, 291). He is listed once again in an inscription of Ashurbanipal among the Assyrian vassals who participated in his campaign to Egypt in 667 b.c.e. (Streck 1916, 140-142 line 28; Oppenheim 1969, 294). Nebuchadrezzar captured Gaza in the course of the conquest of Syria-Palestine in 604 b.c.e. In 601/600 he crossed northern Sinai but was defeated at Magdolos (Herodotus II 159). In a counter-attack Necho II conquered Gaza (Jer 47,1), but could not hold it and retreated to his land (Freedy/Redford 1970, 475 note 57; Lipinski 1972; Lipschits 1998, 468-469). Gaza and Ashdod are mentioned in the list of Philistine and Phoenician kings and their kingdoms that appears in a broken prism written in Nebuchadrezzar IPs seventh year (598 b.c.e.) (Unger 1931, 286 lines 23-29; Oppenheim 1969, 287-288; Na3aman 2000, 40-41, with earlier literature in note 25), whereas Ashkelon and Ekron had been destroyed before 6 The tablet was collated by parpola, who demonstrated that the formerly suggested reading for Rev. 1 ([...] ma-da-t? mA-zu-r[i...]) is erroneous (see parpola 1987, 255). The assumption that the tribute was sent by Azuri, king of Ashdod, must be abandoned. Rev. 1 may tentatively be restored [PAP an-ni]- r? ma-da-t?-^mA-ta\...]; "[All thi]s (is) the tribute of Ata[.. .]". Was Ata[.. .] the ruler of Gaza in the time of Sargon II? 7 Kitchen (1983, 249-251) suggested that Gaza then served as the Egyptian headquarter and as a base for operations. ZDPV 120 (2004) 1</page><page sequence="6">60 Nadav Na'aman that year and are missing from the list. This is the latest textual evidence of Gaza as kingdom under its own ruler. Later, at an unknown date, it was annexed by the Babylonians, and under the Persian Empire was included in the Arabian territory of northern Sinai (see below). The Boundary System of Gaza in the Late Eighth - Seventh Centuries b.c.e. In Iron Age II three Philistine city-states were located along the southern coast of Palestine (fig. 1): Ashdod, Ashkelon and Gaza. The boundaries that separated them are clear: W?d? Ibt?h (Nahal Evtah) between Ashdod and Ashkelon, and W?d? el-Hes? (Nahal Siqm?) be tween Ashkelon and Gaza. The natural northern boundary of the kingdom of Ashdod is Nahr R?bin (Nahal S?r?q), and that of the kingdom of Gaza on the south is W?d? Gazze (Nahal Bds?r). Assuming for the moment that these were the boundaries of the three neighbouring kingdoms, the coast of Ashdod would have extended over about 23 km8, that of Ashkelon over about 18 km and that of Gaza over about 20 km. On the eastern side, the three Iron II kingdoms must have reached the western borders of the kingdom of Gath. Following Hazael's conquest of Gath in the late ninth century b.c.e. (2 Kgs 12,18), Ashdod expanded eastward and annexed the city of Gath. Ashkelon and Gaza also took advantage of Gath's decline and expanded eastward, up to the western border of the kingdom of Judah. The kingdom of Gaza possibly reached the line of Tell en-Nag?le - Tell es-SerVa. On the assumption that the kingdom of Gaza's southern border reached W?d? Gazze (Nahal Bas?r), its southeastern border must have passed W?d? es-SerVa (Nahal Ggr?r), up to its juncture with W?d? Gazze (Nahal Bos?r). Against this 'minimalist' approach to the border system of Gaza, which demarcates its southeastern and southern borders along W?d? es-SerVa (Nahal Gor?r) and W?d? Gazze (Nahal Bas?r), Oren (1993a) has suggested a maximal delineation of Gaza's borders. His point of departure is the distribution of Assyrian centres in the western Negev and northern Sinai. Among these centres are Tell el-Hes?, Tell es-SerVa, Tell Abu Hur?ra, Tell Gemme, Tell Abu Sal?ma and er-Ruq?s, taking it for granted that all these centres were built within the confines of a single kingdom, that of Gaza, and thus mark its borders. Moreover, oren assumed that Gaza effectively controlled large territories and villages located in the sparsely inhabited regions of the western Negev and northern Sinai9. By identifying the Brook of Egypt (Assyrian Nahal Musur) as W?d? el-Aris, he delineated the borders of Gaza between W?d? el-'Ar?s on the southwest, Tell el-F?r"a (south) on the southeast and Tell el-Hes? on the northeast. 8 For the assumption that Ashdod's northern border in the Iron Age passed along Nahr R?b?n (Nahat ??r?q), see Na'aman 1998. In the Late Bronze Age Joppa was an Egyptian centre, and following the Egyptian withdrawal from Canaan in about the mid-twelfth century B.c.E. it became the port of the newly-established kingdom of Ekron (for a different interpretation, see FiNKELSTElN 1996, 228-231). After Ekron's destruction in about the mid-tenth century B.C.E. the area of Joppa passed either to Ashdod or to Ashkelon. In the late eighth century the city and its hinterland were in Ashkelon's hands, and in 701 B.C.E. Sennacherib transferred the area of Joppa to Padi, king of Ekron. It is thus evident that Joppa, with its hinterland, changed hands many times and was never an independent city. This explains its handing over by the Persian king in about the mid-fifth century to Eshmunazer, king of Sidon (donner/R?LLIG 1966-69 no. 14 line 18). 9 For a similar delineation of the territory of Iron I Gaza, see FiNKELSTElN 1996, 228-231.

First, the Assyrian built their centres in the territories of almost all vassal kingdoms in the Levant (see recently: Finkelstein/singer-AviTZ 2001; na'aman 2001, with earlier literature), so the attribution of all the above-mentioned Assyrian centres to the territory of Gaza is arbitrary. Second, the reality of borders that pass through sparsely inhab ited areas, where there were few permanent settlements, must be examined in light of the textual evidence. After all, local leaders might control territories and settlements located in peripheral areas and their tribal territories were not controlled by neighbouring kingdoms. Oren produced no evidence that the rulers of Gaza effectively controlled the sparsely inhab ited areas of northern Sinai and the southwestern Negev, or that those areas were considered part of its territories. Contrary to Oren's suggestion, Assyrian royal inscriptions indicate that the local tribal leaders of northern Sinai and the western Negev cooperated with the Assyrians, who assigned them to supervise their tribal territories (see alt 1945, 131-135; 1953, 160-162; tadmor 1966, 89-92; Na5aman 1979, 69-72.84; Ephcal 1982, 93-94.99-100). For example, Tig lath-pileser appointed IdibPilu as a "gatekeeper facing Egypt" (tadmor 1994, 168 line 6). He also appointed Siruatti the Me'unite to the office of q?pu over the area 'below Egypt' (Na'aman 1997). Sargon placed the s?h (lunas?ku) of the city of Laban (whose name is unfortunately broken) in charge of the deportees settled near the Brook of Egypt (Nahal Musur) (Na3aman 1979, 71 and note 6; fuchs 1998, 57). The toponym rllbn is mentioned after Raphia in Shishak's topographical list, and Alt (1945, 133-134) suggested identifying it with the Laban mentioned in Sargon's inscription. Laban was probably a tribal centre located in the Raphia area, where Sargon settled deportees to replace those that he deported in his 720 b.c.e. campaign (Alt 1945, 130-134; Na5aman 1979, 81-82). Esarhaddon in his second year (679 b.c.e.) conducted a campaign against Arza, a city located in the border zone of the Brook of Egypt {Nahal Musur), plundered the city and deported Asuhili, its king, and its inhabitants (for references, see borger 1956, 130 sub voce Arza; Oppenheim 1969, 290.292). Asuhili was probably a local s?h, leader of the pastoral groups who lived in the area of Nahal Musur, and his status in this area was similar to that of the s?h of Laban in the time of Sargon II ( a5a a 2001, 264-265). IdibPilu, Siruatti, the s?h of Laban and Asuhili were tribal leaders who lived in the area near the border of Egypt, and their tribal territories were not included in the kingdom of Gaza's territory. It is thus clear that Gaza's southern and eastern borders passed north and west of their territories. Preparing to cross the Sinai desert and conquer Egypt (671 b.c.e.), Esarhaddon arrived in Raphia and there made the final preparations for crossing the desert (borger 1956, 112 lines 16-18). He described it thus: "Camels (ansegammali) of all the kings of the Arabs I gfathered and goatskins I l]oaded on them" (borger 1956, 112 rev. lines 1-2). A parallel fragmented passage mentions goat- and waterskins (borger 1957/58, 118 ?77 line 10)10. The Arabs controlled both the road and other means of transportation, making it necessary to cooperate with them (Ephcal 1982, 137-142). The king of Gaza, who, according to Oren's assump tion, effectively governed the area of Raphia, played no part in the preparations to the cam paign and evidently had no power in this area. 10 For the amount of water necessary for the army to cross the Sinai desert, see the estimation of Cruz-Uribe 2003, 22-23. ZDPV 120 (2004) 1</page><page sequence="9">The Boundary System and Political Status of Gaza under the Assyrian Empire 63 Sargon ITs inscriptions state that he "opened the sealed h[arb]our (k[?r]u) of Egypt, mingled Assyrians and Egyptians together and made them trade with each other" (Gadd 1954, 179 lines 46-49; fuchs 1994, 88 lines 17-18). Oren (1993b; Oren et al. 1986) identified the "sealed harbour" as the well-planned and heavily fortified site of er-Ruq?s. The site is located along the coast, about 7.5 km south of W?d? Gazze (Nahal Bos?r), and covers an area of about 20-25 acres. Its geometric configuration, internal plan, massive defense system and mud brick platforms - all these elements indicate that it was built by the Assyrians and served as their main port on the coast south of Gaza. Oren's suggested identification of er-Ruq?s with the "sealed harbour" that Sargon built is fully vindicated by his excavations at the site. Sargon's statement, that he opened "the sealed harbour of Egypt", is remarkable. It indicates that the Assyrians considered the area of er-Ruq?s to be Egyptian territory, and contradicts the assumption that W?d? e l-Aris, located about 60 km southwest of it, marked the border of Egypt. Reading the Assyrian royal inscriptions, it becomes clear that before the conquest of Egypt, the city of Raphia, located 21 km south of the estuary of W?d? Gazze (Nahal Bds?r), far northeast (47km) from W?d? el-"Aris, was the southernmost place they reached in their campaigns. This is indicated by two references: (1) In 720 b.c.e. Sargon fought an Egyptian task force led by the army commander Re5e (Egyptian Raia or RaHa), and after his victory destroyed the city of Raphia and deported its people (see above). At er-Ruq?s, about the midway between Raphia and W?d? Gazze (Nahal Bds?r), he built the new port to serve as a major harbour for the commerce with Egypt, thereby competing with Gaza for the profits from the Egyptian trade. The new harbour also secured the naval and continental transportation between Gaza and Raphia. (2) In his campaign to conquer Egypt (671 b.c.e.) Esarhaddon camped at Aphek (Tell Ras el- ), near the southwestern border of the province of Samaria, and proceeded southward "as far as (adi) the town of Raphia, to the border zone (ana ite) of the Brook of Egypt". The location of Raphia is defined by reference to the region of the Brook of Egypt (/. e., ana ite nahal m?t musur is an adjunct sentence to adi Rapihi), just as the location of the city of Aphek is defined by reference to the province of Samaria (Apqu sa p?ti m?t Same&lt;ri&gt;na) (Borger 1956, 112 line 16)n. In Raphia Esarhaddon loaded on camels as much water as they could carry for crossing the desert, and continued on its way to Egypt. It is evident that Raphia appears as the last settled station on the way to Egypt. The two references indicate that the area between W?d? Gazze (Nahal Bos?r) and Raphia was considered a kind of buffer zone separating the kingdom of Gaza from the Egyptian territory. Further support for this conclusion may be drawn from the location of the Brook of Egypt (Nahal Musur). Two conflicting identifications of its place were proposed: W?d? Gazze (Nahal Bos?r) and W?d? el-Ans. Enclosed are the transcription and translation of the five key references that appear in the inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III (no. 1), Sargon II (no. 2) and Esarhaddon (nos. 3-5): 11 Rainey's translations of ana ite ("as far as, towards") and sa ite ("which is beside") are not sup ported by textual evidence (Rainey 1982, 131; 2001, 60).

I rendered the three nouns itu, pattu and p?tu by "border zone", since these terms, like the cognate Hebrew term gsb?l, refer to an area rather than to a borderline. It is evident that Raphia and Arza were located near the Brook of Egypt. Mazar (1952) suggested identifying Arza as Tell Gemme, on W?dT Gazze (Nahal Bos?r), and his suggestion was accepted by some scholars ( a a 1979, 72-73, with earlier literature; Van Beek 1993, 672; Wapnish 1996, 287-288)l2. I recently discussed the ar chaeological evidence of Tell Gemme, in particular the rib vaulting over the doorways be tween the rooms and the ostraca. These indicate that at least some of the inhabitants who lived on the site had come from the Zagros mountains (Na3aman/Zadok 1988; Na'aman 2001, 263-266). It fits Sargon's statement that he settled deportees, who probably came from the newly-established Assyrian provinces in the east, in the border zone of the Brook of Egypt (fuchs 1998, 28.57). We may conclude that until the Assyrian conquest of Egypt (671 b.c.e.) the area between W?dT Gazze (Nahal Bas?r; the Brook of Egypt) and Raphia was considered the frontier of the Assyrian empire, and that northern Sinai was considered to be Egyptian territory. Gaza's southeastern and southwestern borders probably reached the line of W?d? es-SerVa (Nahal Gdr?r) and W?dT Gazze (Nahal Bss?r), the areas beyond these wadis being controlled by the Arabs, who cooperated with the Assyrians, and due to the latter's dependence on their trans portation, gradually gained greater power and economic strength (briant 1982, 153-176). The Shifting of the Border in the Sixth - Fifth Centuries b.c.e. Esarhaddon's 671 b.c.e. campaign, in which he crossed northern Sinai and conquered Lower Egypt, marked a shift in the history of northern Sinai. His son, Ashurbanipal, conducted several campaigns to Egypt and succeeded in expanding the Assyrian domination to Upper Egypt. This was the first time since the end of the Late Bronze Age that an empire effectively controlled the road that crossed northern Sinai, although for only a short time. Assyria no doubt made efforts to strengthen its grip over the main routes of northern Sinai, and must have built at least some centres in strategic locations along the road. How 12 For the identification of the Brook of Egypt as W?d? el-(Ans, see Rainey 1982, 131-132; EPHcal 1982, 103-105; Ahituv 1984, 203 note 631; Oren 1993a, 102-103; Stern 2001, 114; cf. Hooker 1993.

Tell Abu SalTma (S?h Zuw?yid) is a case in point. The site is located about 15 km west of Raphia (Refah), and a fortress with an Assyrian temple was discovered in the excavations13. However, we cannot decide whether it was built before or after Esarhaddon's campaign to Egypt. The scope of the Assyrian building operations in northern Sinai after the conquest of Egypt cannot be established. The process of settlement in northern Sinai grew rapidly after the Assyrian conquest of southern Palestine in the late eighth century and the new economic opportunities that emerged as a result of the pax Assyriaca. We may assume that the Assyrian conquest of Egypt further accelerated this process. After the Assyrian retreat from Egypt, the Egyptians took its terri tories in Palestine and probably pursued a similar policy in their relations with the vassals and nomads, so that prosperity and economic growth continued uninterrupted. Under the Neo-Babylonian empire the kingdom of Gaza was still considered the south ernmost region in Asia. This is indicated by one of Nabonidus' royal inscriptions. The Bab ylonian king summoned his troops from all over his realm, defining its southwestern border as "the land of Gaza on the border of Egypt (p?t m?t Misir)" (langdon 1912, 220 lines 39-40). In another inscription commemorating his mother, Adad-Guppi\ Nabonidus men tions Egypt (Misir) as marking his southwestern border (p?tu) (Gadd 1958, 48 line 42; 62 line 19). It is therefore clear that, as in the time of the Assyrian empire, Gaza's southern border was considered in the sixth century to be the southernmost frontier of the Neo Babylonian empire (see Vanderhooft 1999, 39 note 142). 1 Kgs 4,21-24 [MT 5,1-4]: "Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt. [. ..] For he had dominion over all the region west the River from Tiphsah to Gaza". According to this late (post deuteronomistic) text, Solomon's kingdom extended from the Euphrates to Gaza, which, just like the south western border of Nabonidus' kingdom, marks the border of Egypt. Thus Solomon was depicted as the ruler of an enormous kingdom, equal in extent to the Assyrian and Babylonian territory of eher nari ("Beyond the River"). A new concept of the place of Sinai in the boundary system emerged after Cambyses' conquest of Egypt in about 525 b.c.e. (for the campaign, see recently Cruz-Uribe 2003, with earlier literature). This is reflected in the history of Herodotus, who wrote his work after the organization of the Persian province system by Darius I (521-486). Herodotus (III 5) de scribes the extent of the satrapy of "Beyond the River" (eher n?riTAbar-nahar?) as follows (the translation follows godley 1938): 13 For the excavations on the site, see reich 1984, with earlier literature. In the Hellenistic period Tell Ab? Sallma was probably called Bytyl, and in the Byzantine period was called Bitulion (alt 1926; abel 1939, 227-228.544-548; 1940, 224-227; Tsafrir/di Segni/Green 1994, 91, with earlier literature). Albright (1924, 154-155) suggested identifying Byzantine Betulion with Biblical Beth el (1 Sam 30,27) and Bethul/Bethuel (Josh 19,4; 1 Chr 4,30). Although this suggested identification is untenable (Alt 1935, 309-310), the ancient site may well have been called Bethel, possibly after the temple erected there by the Assyrians. ZDPV 120 (2004) 1</page><page sequence="12">66 Nadav Na'aman "Now the only manifest way of entry into Egypt is this. The road runs from Phoenice as far as the borders of the city of Kadytis, which belongs to the Syrians of Palestine, as it is called. From Kadytis (which, as I judge, is a city not much smaller than Sardis) to the city of Ienysus the seaports belong to the Arabs; then they are Syrian again from Ienysus as far as the Serbonian marsh, beside which the Casian promontory stretches seawards; from this Serbonian marsh [. . .] the country is Egypt. Now between Ienysus and the Casian mountain and the Serbonian marsh there lies a wide territory for as much as three days' journey, wondrous waterless". On the basis of a philological analysis, Leuze (1935, 105 -108) demonstrated that the borders of Philistia ("from Phoenice as far as the borders of the city of Kadytis") exclude the men tioned toponyms; that the seaports of the Arabs includes Gaza/Kadytis 14 and Ienysus; and that the territory of the Syrians ("from Ienysus as far as the Serbonian marsh") excludes the mentioned toponyms. He thus concluded that Gaza was at that time in the hands of the Arabs, and his conclusion was accepted by other scholars (e.g., MlTTMANN 1983, 132.140; lemaire 1990, 45-46.74; Well 1991, 51-52; Rainey 2001, 59-60),5. Herodotus (II 158; III 5) wrote that the borderline between the fifth satrapy of the Persian empire ("beyond the River") and the sixth (Egypt) ran close to Mount Casius. The shifting of the border and the inclusion of northern Sinai in the fifth satrapy - contrary to the concept of the border under the Assyrian and Babylonian empires - were the result of Cambyses' con quest of Egypt and its annexation to the empire's province system. The conquest of Egypt radically changed the 'northern' concept of Sinai as an Egyptian territory whose border was located on the Brook of Egypt (Nahal Musur). Northern Sinai was no longer viewed as a kind of 'no-man's land', a territory that was attributed both in Egypt and in Palestine to the kingdom located on its other end (Na'aman 1986, 237-251). In the fifth century b.c.e. northern Sinai was inhabited and considered an integral part of the province to the north of it. The territory controlled by the Arabs was excluded from that of the fifth satrapy (see Abel 1939, 543). This is indicated by the passage cited above (Herodotus III 5), and by Herodotus III 91: "The fifth province was the country (except the part belonging to the Arabs, which paid no tribute) between Posideion, a city founded on the Cilician and Syrian border by Amphilochus son of Am phiaraus, and Egypt; this paid three hundred and fifty talents; in this province was all Phoenice, and the part of Syria called Palestine, and Cyprus". As for Gaza, the city developed under the Persian kings and became the most important city in Palestine. Herodotus (III 5) described it as a town "not much smaller than Sardis". Its rise and prosperity resulted from Ashkelon's decline after its destruction in 604 b.c.e., and from its prominent place in the south Arabian trade and the commerce with Egypt under the Babylonian and Persian empires. Herodotus II 159 wrote that "Necho [. . .] met and defeated the Syrians at Magdolus, taking the great Syrian city of Kadytis after the battle". Gaza is explicitly called a "great Syrian city" - /. e., its inhabitants are those Herodotus (III 5; VII 89) calls "Syrians of Palestine". Assuming that Herodotus' description of Gaza reflects the reality of his time, it suggests that the majority of the city's inhabitants were autochthonous 'Philis tines', although political and economic control was in the hands of the Arabs (see Leuze 1935, 107). 14 For the name Kadytis (which is interpreted as a nisbe-form, "that of Gaza, Gazaean"), see QuAE gebeur 1995. 15 For a different opinion, see Katzenstein 1989, 71; Mildenberg 1990, 140-141.145-146. ZDPV 120 (2004) 1</page><page sequence="13">The Boundary System and Political Status of Gaza under the Assyrian Empire 67 We may conclude that, according to Herodotus, the fifth satrapy extended between the town of Posideion, on the southern border of Cilicia, in the north and Mount Casius in the south. The Arabian territory between Gaza's northern border and Ienysus in the south (usually located near el-cAnS; see already Stark 1852, 223-224)16 did not belong to the satrapy,7. According to Pseudo-Scylax ? 104, the borders of Syria and Phoenicia extended from the Thapsakos River (the Orontes River) in the north, to Ashkelon in the south (leuze 1935, 204-229, with earlier literature; Galling 1938; Elayi 1982). The description concludes with the words: "This is the border of Coele-Syria. The sailing along the coast from the estuary of Thapsakos to the city of Ashkelon amounts to 1700 stadia". The delineation of Pseudo-Scylax, written in about the mid-fourth century b.c.e., differs from that of Herodotus in that it concentrates on the Phoenician cities and their settlements along the coast and ignores the Syrian cities. Assuming that Galling's amendment to the first lines of the text is valid (Galling 1938, 70-71), the description opens with Arados (Arwad) and leaves a territorial gap between the Orontes and Arados. The text ends with Ashkelon and omits the area between Gaza and Mount Casius. It is thus evident that the Coele-Syria referred to in Pseudo-Scylax differs from Herodotus' satrapy of "Beyond the River". Conclusions Summing up the discussion, it is clear that throughout the Iron Age II, Gaza's southern border was located near the border zone of W?d? Gazze (Nahal Bas?r; the Brook of Egypt). That its rulers sometimes held the area of Raphia is a possibility, but cannot be established with certainty. The area of northern Sinai was controlled by Arabian tribal leaders, each having its tribal centre and territory. Their settlements may be described as a kind of urban centres in a nomadic environment (compare rowton 1973; 1976). Following the conquest of Syria Palestine, the Assyrians appointed some tribal leaders as their representatives in these periph eral areas. The Arabs gained political and economic power from the cooperation with the empires, and from the accelerating settlement process in the peripheral areas in the course of the 7th - 5th centuries b.c.e., and gradually consolidated their hold in these areas. This is evident from Herodotus' description of the Arabian control of the emporia of northern Sinai, including the major city of Gaza, in the fifth century b.c.e. Under the Persian empire the Arabs alone had a king and semi-independent status, and this is reflected in Herodotus' statement that their territory in northern Sinai was not included in the Persian taxation system (Herodotus III 91)18. A direct line may be drawn from the independence of the Arab leaders in northern Sinai before the Assyrian conquest, when they cooperated with the Philistine rulers, to their growing political and economic power as a result of their cooperation with the Assyrian empire, and finally to their independence and control over the coast between Gaza and Ienysus under the Persian empire. 16 Abel (1939, 539-541) suggested that the name Ienysus has the structure of a Greek name that appears in Herodotus with the suffixes -ssos, or -ussos. He therefore disassociated the town from Rhinocorura (el-'ArTs) and located it in the vicinity of S?h Zuw?yid. 17 For the road system of northern Sinai in the Persian period, see Graf 1993, 161-167, with earlier literature. 18 For the Arabs on the periphery of Palestine in the Persian period, see Ephcal 1982, 192-214; Knauf 1990; Graf 1990; Lemaire 1990, 45-54, with earlier literature; 1997. ZDPV 120 (2004) 1</page><page sequence="14">68 Nadav Na'aman There are no textual evidence concerning Gaza's relations with the tribal leaders on its southern and southeastern borders prior to the Assyrians conquest of 734 b.c.e. There must have been agreements between the two sides whereby the tribal leaders kept their autonomy and were allowed to engage in their long-distance trade in return for customs and presents. The two sides benefited from the revenues gained from the commerce, and the agreements must have been kept, since neither side was able to take the place of the other. The relations of Gaza's rulers with Assyria were entirely different. I have recently tried to show the aggressive nature of the policy implemented by the kings of Assyria in the Levant, and the extent of Assyrian intervention in the internal affairs of their vassals (Na'AMAN 2001). Tiglath-pileser III wrote that he turned the city of Gaza into an Assyrian emporium (bit k?ri). The text probably refers to the construction of an emporium near Gaza, which may tentatively be identified with the heavily fortified late Iron II settlement of el-Bla'h?ye, situ ated near the city of Gaza (Humbert/SADEQ 2000). Sargon built the new port of er-Ruq?s, which competed with Gaza for the revenues from the trade with Egypt and for the profits of the Arabian trade. The many anti-Assyrian rebellions that broke out in kingdoms along the Mediterranean coast, including the two revolts of Hanunu of Gaza, were the direct results of the Assyrian imperial activity. Under Assyrian rule, Gaza possibly declined; but following the destruction of Assyria, and later that of Ashkelon, its northern neighbour, Gaza gained power and reached its zenith under the Persian empire, when it was controlled by the Arabs, held the foremost position among the coastal cities of Palestine, and was described as "not much smaller than Sardis" (Herodotus III 5). Territory is no doubt an important component in the strength and economic power of kingdoms. But there are other factors, no less important, such as location, naval and conti nental routes and means of transportation, capital and internal organization. Alhough its territorial extent was limited, Gaza took advantage of these means and became one of the most important cities in Palestine in the first millennium b.c.e. Bibliography Abel, F.
