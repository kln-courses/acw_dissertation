Ph., XXVI, IO et II, PP. 345-378; 50I-539. (I) Intuition is the first form of the equilibrium and harmony of con- sciousness. In passing over to judgment, it is necessary first to resolve the totality of intuition, i. e., to analyze. In order to examine the transition from intuition to judgment, one must distinguish between the three principal forms of intuition: (I) intuition of sensation, (2) of perception, (3) of mem- ory and imagination. Intuition of sensation involves a combination of more elementary sensations, but not necessarily a fusion. In the intuition of perception, memory is already an important factor; the new is identified with the previous experience which it most resembles. The intuition of memory and imagination is distinguished from the other two forms by the greater clearness with which the processes giving rise to intuition come out in consciousness. What makes the matter more complicated, is the fact that motives of feeling are operative here more than elsewhere. In all this, we are confronted with an antinomy. The most characteristic trait of mental life is synthetic activity; but the synthesis presupposes something that can be put together, and no simple elements appear in consciousness. We find ourselves going in a circle-a sign that we are before one of the limits of our understanding. Not all ' potential judgments' can be trans- formed into real judgments. Several authors regard (what would better be called) 'intuition of articulation' as a form of judgment; but such implicit judgments differ from judgments proper, which involve analysis. (II) Association is to the dynamic what intuition is to the static aspect of mental life. Spontaneity belongs to both. Association and intuition are distinguished from judgment in a similar way; the attention is not directed to the relation between the elements that are combined. Judg- ment intervenes the moment this relation attracts attention. Interest and attention are operative in every case of association. Association is mainly</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 189 productive, while judgment is critical; but this contrast is not absolute. There is a continuous reciprocal action between the two. (III) Judgment, in the strict sense, is the higher form of the solution of the problem which, in a more elementary form, is resolved by intuition or by association. Analysis is essential here. The essence of judgment is the new combination rendered more clear by the preceding analysis; but not every analysis leads to a judgment. In analysis, differences appear more clearly than before; but, on the other hand, a resemblance and a continuity more fundamental than that in intuition and association may also appear. There is always a tendency in abstract thought to maintain a cer- tain number of categories, but history shows that these tend to change as a result of further experience. (IV) Positive judgments apparently precede negative judgments. A negative judgment does not afford a new content; its important function is precisely to reject such a new content. At the same time, its value con- sists in preparing the way for further positive judgments. In provisional classifications, we must often rest content with defining a certain domain in merely negative terms. It is the task of further research to discover the characteristic positive traits of the enclosed domain. (V) Propositions without subjects maybe divided into two classes: (i) those where the subject has already been named or is understood more or less clearly from the context; (2) those which are purely descrip- tive, i. e., where one describes a phenomenon without its being gram- matically possible to indicate a definite subject,-e. g., 'it is cold.' It is always to be noted that the logical predicate is the most important element of judgment. As Trendelenburg says: We think in predi- cates. One might almost venture the hypothesis that all words are at first predicates, and that it is only later that they appear as grammatical sub- jects; but perhaps careful investigation would not confirm this hypothesis. The subject is the hinge upon which the gate turns; it is the gate and its movement that strike the eye, not the hinge. Predicative judgments, at any rate, are not a mere combination of conceptions. Passing to judg- ments where both subject and predicate are expressed, we find that the prominence of the subject may vary considerably, while the predicate al- ways remains the more prominent element. (H. gives several classes of examples which go to prove this.) Judgment is formed by a voluntary or involuntary comparison. As soon as this comparison presents itself as a formal task, we may speak of reasoning proper. Comparison presupposes a bringing together. The synthetic process involved is the same that we meet with throughout the conscious life. One may very well continue to define judgment as a combination of conceptions, but it is necessary to remember that conceptions themselves are completely determined only when they are combined so as to form a judgment. Moreover, each new judgment contributes to the formation of further conceptions. This may look like moving in a circle, but such is the enigma of the origin of</page><page sequence="3">I90 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XI. both organic and conscious life: neither in the one nor in the other can the totality exist without parts, and neither in the one nor in the other can the totality be explained as the result of a mere combination of parts. (VI) Intuitions, associations, and judgments appear at first with an ex- istential quality which can become the object of consciousness only if a contrary quality (non-existence) is met with in experience, which will take place as soon as one recognizes the fact that experience affords negative as well as positive cases. One gradually comes to recognize the necessity of the reciprocal harmony of all that can exist, and thus to employ a formal criterion of reality. The world of experience is constantly growing, and is never completed. Moreover, the conception of reality or existence is an ideal conception, strange as it may seem; and this also develops with our increasing knowledge of the world order. Appreciative judgments are somewhat analogous to those of existence; by means of them one creates an ideal world, the dominant law of which is determined by the apprecia- tive principle. Thus moral and religious problems are intimately connected with those of science. E. A. Les dogmatismes sociaux et la liberation de Z'individu. S. PALANTE. Rev. Ph., XXVI, i2, pp. 626-647. The purpose of the author is to expose the inanity of every social dogma, which exposure he regards as the indispensable propoedeutic for the libera- tion of the individual. Social dogmatisms are classified as dogmatisms a priori, and dogmatisms a fiosteriori. Of the first class, there are distin- guished two types: the transcendent rationalism, and the rationalism of immanence. Plato and Kant are representatives of the transcendent rationalism, and Hegel of immanence. The dogmatisms a fiosteriori are expressed bay the term, solidarity. There are several forms of solidarity, such as generic or organic solidarity, economic solidarity, intellectual solidarity, and moral and social solidarity. All of these forms have been invoked as the basis of social dogmatisms. After reviewing these different kinds of solidarity, the author concludes " that it is impossible to erect in dogma, the collective egoism." He also adds that " these collective egoisms remain armed against one another, and the law of the struggle for existence, in spite of optimistic affirmations, displays here, implacably, its effects. H. C. STEVENS. The World as Mechanism. G. S. FULLERTON. Psych. Rev., IX, i, pp. I- 26. Science is coming more and more to the view that the changes which take place in the world of matter form an unbroken series and are all ex- plicable according to mechanical laws. As yet, however, there are many phenomena of which no mechanical explanation can be given. But to admit our present ignorance is not to maintain that it is, in the nature of</page><page sequence="4">No. 2.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 191 things, ultimate and irremovable. The steady growth of science encourages a hope that discontinuity will give place to continuity. This faith in the mechanism of nature can be justified only by an actual extension of knowl- edge, and until then, the doctrine can be no more than a working hypoth- esis. The purpose of this paper is to examine the considerations brought forward to prove that mechanism should not be held even as a working hypothesis. (i) Dr. Ward's attempt to prove that the science of mechanics is no true science, and that its fundamental concepts are absurd and self-con- tradictory, arises out of a misconception of the nature of the science, and of the foundation upon which it rests. This misconception is to suppose that a true science can have no limitations, and that it must be complete before it can have a foundation. We may well admit that all our measurements are only approximate, and that certain scientific concepts, useful within a given sphere, are inadequate when carried beyond the confines of our knowledge. But this is not to say that mechanics is not a true science, or that it does not rest upon a reasonably secure foundation. It remains true that we can, e. g., calculate with some degree of accuracy the position of the moon with reference to the earth on a particular day and hour, and we can trace with some accuracy the path of a projectile. If, in the light of new discoveries, some scientific laws have to be modified, it means only that a truth imperfectly apprehended has come to be more perfectly apprehended. A growth in human knowledge is not revolution. (2) Certain writers have denied the existence of material causes, because they confound the notions of causality and activity, or erroneously assume that a cause can only be some- thing occult and mysterious. The relation between cause and effect is not that of activity and passivity, but at the same time it is more than that of mere antecedence and succession. The cause is the I necessary' and inde- spensable' antecedent, and such antecedents science is able definitely to pick out, overlooking, for its purposes, the negligible influences of other antecedents. (3) Some writers repudiate natural necessity, simply because they fail to see that the word I necessity ' is an ambiguous one. Necessity is but another name for orderliness, and to deny this necessity is to deny all possibility of knowledge. Again, it has been maintained that science should not attempt 'explanation,' but confine itself to 'description.' But it is only by giving the word I explanation' an unjustifiable meaning that we can insist that science is unable to offer any explanation of occurrences in the material world. (4) Many who feel that mechanical causes are suffi- cient to bring about all the changes in the inorganic world, yet cannot be- lieve that the conception of mechanism is adequate when we pass to the organic world. The phenomena of plant and animal life seem too com- plex to admit of description in mechanical terms; and such a thing as choice of ends is absolutely wanting in even the most ingenious mechanisms. Between mechanisms and the higher forms of living beings the difference is admittedly enormous. But between the two there are forms of life that bring us near to the point where the gulf between the organic and the</page><page sequence="5">192 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI. inorganic seems passable. Those who hold that all motions in matter can- not be accounted for on mechanical grounds, are not agreed as to where the line should be drawn, and modern science is strongly inclined to remove all breaks in the orderly development of nature. M. S. MACDONALD. Choice and Nature. EDGAR A. SINGER, JR. Mind, No. 41, PP. 72-91. The individual finds himself confronted with a group of facts. Every judgment capable of either truth or error must involve a question of fact. That is not to say that every judgment reduces to a question of fact; for in so far as these facts have enough meaning to be pointed out as facts they show the traces of description with all that this implies of past choices of classification. At any stage of our growing knowledge, if we try to tell what nature is, we are presented with a choice of alternative classifications; and as no stage can be found which does not embody past choices, it would seem that this series of choices is involved in anything we do or can mean by nature. At no stage are we presented with a situation so purely fact- ual that it cannot be altered by a re-interpretation. Observation has an important place in our lives ; but our experience is not increased by bare additions. The real value of observation is to serve as the stimulus to new interpretations. These interpretations are indeterminate save for a prin- ciple of choice not given by the facts themselves. This choice is not the individual's own, nor is it the choice of the society of his own time, for that is only a larger individual; but it is the choice of universal society. To contradict the will of this universal society would be the destruction of the meaning of experience. Such a will dictates a principle of choice that gratifies a desire which an individual may well possess. In so far as an individual desires what all must desire if they would have experience, na- ture as embodying our interpretations must yield him satisfaction. But in so far as the desire is purely individual, nature offers no guarantee that it shall be granted. As the type of universal desire we have taken maximum simplicity, economy, or unity. It may be that the concepts of goodness and beauty are involved in this principle. G. W. T. WHITNEY. Le fhenomenisme et lancienne metafhysique. D. MERCIER. Rev. Neo- Scolastique, VIII, 4, pp. 321-337. Many modern philosophers consider the ancient distinction between sub- stance and accident superfluous; there are, they say, exterior phenomena and internal occurrences; between these there are relations of succession and reciprocal action, and neither exterior observation nor consciousness show us anything else. ' Substance' is a thing unknowable, and there- fore of no importance.-The dispute centers about two points: (I) Has the intelligence ideas upon the specific nature of beings, the objective reality of which it can guarantee ? (2) Does immediate experience give us a sub-</page><page sequence="6">No. 2.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 193 stance and accidents, and, if so, what is the reality of the first as distinct from that of the second ? It may be answered that we have an immediate, although confused, knowledge of substance in the first immediate notion of something existing in itself. What we perceive through experience is a being existing in itself, or a being existing in another being. The existence of accidents presupposes a substance.-It may be admitted that the sub- stance-soul is not adequately distinct from its acts; but that it is not Partially distinct must be denied. We never see accidents without substance, nor substance without accidents, and natural reason is incompetent to establish, within the created world, their adequate distinction. Only Catholic the- ology teaches us that there are-in the Holy Eucharist-accidents without substance. GEORGIA BENEDICT. Is Position in Tzne and Space Absolute or Relative 7 B. RUSSELL. Mind, No. 39, pp. 293-317. This paper contains: (I) A statement of the absolute and relative theories of time and space; (2) a proof that in the case of time it is difficult, if not impossible, to free the relational theory from contradiction; (3) a proof that in the case of space, the relational theory must be so modified, if it is to be logically permissible, as to lose all the advantages which it claims over the absolute theory; and (4) a refutation of the arguments against absolute space. The absolute theory of time assumes two classes of entities: those which are positions, and those which have positions. By compounding a term which has position with a position which it has we obtain a complex term -the term at the position. Three simple relations are found: before, after, and at. The relational theory requires but a single class of entities, any two of which may have one and only one of three unanalyzable re- lations: priority, posteriority, and simultaneity. But no entities answering to this definition can be found. And if the advocate of this theory aban- dons the search for events with a unique temporal position, and confines himself to qualities (i. e., to terms which have position in time), he finds it impossible to obtain a time-series at all. It becomes necessary to hold that qualities as such have temporal relations. So that if one quality be found to precede another, we must hold that the former as such precedes the latter as such. But the former may also be found to succeed, or to be simultaneous with the latter. This breaks down the whole time-series, which depends upon the mutual incompatibility of its constituent relations. -In the case of space, the relational theory, if it confines itself to actual material points, between which spatial relations exist, is unable to give an account, consistent with the facts, of the intersection of geometrical figures, the order of lines and planes, and the nature of areas and volumes. If it invokes other material points, not assumed to exist, but regarded as entities related to time and to existent material points, as these are related to time and to each other, it becomes logically admissible, but loses whatever ad-</page><page sequence="7">194 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI. vantage it may possess over the absolute theory. Lotze' s arguments against absolute space are answered at length. Lotze's theory of relations implies that all propositions consist in the ascription of a predicate to a subject, and that this ascription is not a relation. The objection is, that the predicate is either something or nothing. If nothing, it cannot be predicated, and the pretended proposition collapses. If something, predication expresses a relation, and a relation of the very kind which the theory was designed to avoid. Thus in either case, the theory stands condemned. J. W. BAIRD. PSYCHOLOGICAL. On Active Attention. F. H. BRADLEY. Mind, No. 41, PP. 1-31. Active attention is defined by the author, "I as such theoretic or percep- tive occupancy of myself, by an object, as is due to and involved in a voli- tion of some sort, directed on that object." From this, it appears that active attention, on one side, partakes of the nature of thought, and, on the other, of the nature of will. Both thought and will may exist independent of active attention. But active attention implies the essence of both, in that it is occupied by an ' object' which is ideal, and in that it attempts the realization of that ' object.' By 'object' of attention is meant, not a single perception or idea, but the "set of interest" in which a single detail finds itself. H. C. STEVENS. The Dynamics of Attention. G. SPILLER. Mind, No. 40, pp. 498-524. "I Attention is identical with cerebral changes. It means neural function- ing or the expenditure of that portion of the fund of bodily energy which is devoted to neural functioning." In considering attention we consider the play of neural changes from the point of view of their direction, degree, and volume. This paper then claims to deal with a certain aspect of cerebral change-with the reasons why such changes tend now in this direction, now in that. These reasons are summarized as sixteen factors which in- duce changes in the field of attention. Among them are: fatigue, com- petition of a strong sensation, attainment by attention of its end, anxiety, hunger, etc., persistent memory of a tune or a word, call to duty, etc., etc. Attention is the sine qua non of the existence for us of everything intelligible. Our whole world-outer and inner alike-is essentially dependent upon it; sensations, images, and feelings, owe their existence to it. No process of organic functioning, no act, however habitual, occurs without it. Attention in the normal waking state is quantitatively alike in all men at all times. This quantum may be concentrated upon a small area, or diffused over a broad field-though the latter case is rather a rapid succession of flights from part to part. The direction of attention never rests, but is in constant change. We undoubtedly can attend to more than one object at a time. Indeed, it is impossible to attend to a single object. Attention deals, not</page><page sequence="8">No. 2.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 195 with points, but with fields; it has no focus. Among the conditions favor- able to attention, the author enumerates: the presence of an irresistible inclination to attend; good health, because ill-health decreases the amount of energy available for functioning; interest in, and previous acquaintance with, the object of attention; ability to dismiss the previous object of atten- tention and to attend whole heartedly to the new object. Willing is dis- tinguished from attention in that "I attention always is change and nothing else, while volition never is change, but only points to it. The relation is that between being and becoming, between sein and warden." J. W. BAIRD. Psychology as a Natural Science. E. H. GRIFFIN. Presbyterian and Re- formed Review, Oct., I90I, PP. 560-578. Since psychology has taken its place among the natural sciences, its old conceptions have necessarily given place to new. Only such occurrences as are open to observation can be described, and analysed, and classified. Hence, modern psychology resolutely confines itself to phenomena, to states of consciousness as such, without regard to their ultimate ground or mean- ing. Indeed, some of its advocates have gone so far as to maintain that sensations and the ideas derivable from them, are the sole factors of con- sciousness. Thus Munsterberg has been led to regard the will as a mere complex of sensations-a position which ignores "I the initiative, the selec- tive, and preferential energy of volition." Moreover, MUnsterberg himself admits elsewhere, that this "conglomerate of psycho-physical atoms " does not constitute the real will, but is only an artificial psychological ab- straction therefrom. The modern psychologist defines the self or mind as the sum total of conscious processes. This characterization, however, proves to be inadequate from the epistemological point of view, for it was long since shown that the self, as a unifying activity of consciousness, is a necessary prerequisite of cognition. A rigid adherence to the phenomenal standpoint would confine psychology to the circle of our own ideas, and would forever bar our progress to a world of reality beyond. Psychology would then be powerless to investigate even such problems as perception, memory, and the logical function. For, perceptual and reasoned knowledge imply trans-subjective reference, and recognition implies a persisting per- sonal identity. Should we then accept the prevailing natural history con- ception of psychology, to the extent of excluding all metaphysical postu- lates ? This conception has advantages, it is true, in the study of strictly empirical problems, but it is inadequate for the investigation of mind in its entirety. J. W. BAIRD.</page><page sequence="9">i96 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI. ETHICAL. Influence of the Idea of Esthetic Protortion on the Ethics of Shaftesbury. M. F. LIBBY. Am. J. Ps., XII, 4, pp. 458-491. The writer of this essay aims to show to what extent the allied notions of proportion, symmetry, and harmony, have influenced the ethical views of Shaftesbury, and thus to estimate somewhat the influence of these aesthetic notions upon ethical theory and upon conduct. }Esthetic proportion dif- fers from proportion as understood in other branches of science in that the ground of comparisons of ratios is beauty, or some other modification of the aesthetic judgment. From Shaftesbury's point of view, ethics is a branch of aesthetics, and the notion of quantity can be strictly and prac- tically applied to character and to moral or social relations. He would hold that moral ideas are legitimate art material. This is true, for art does not demand the " I physically existing, " nor even the " I concrete, " but the in- dividual. It may deal with all that is of human interest. Moral ideas do, and have entered into poetry, painting, and music. That proportion can be applied to ideas is evident from the idea of time which may be measured mathematically. A just proportion between self and non-self is all impor- tant for Shaftesbury in literature, in enthusiasms, in ethical motivation, and in the contemplation of nature. His idea is not fanciful. iEsthetic norms can be applied. A mere thought or feeling can be measured by its effect, and wherever the notion of quantity or number can be applied, the notion of proportion is also applicable. Indirectly, moral ideas can be measured in the objective, by the study of historical and social institutions, and by their reflection in art. Ethics may be regarded as a branch of aesthetics in Shaftesbury' s sense, in so far as the pleasure derived from proportion and symmetry is that of a disinterested spectator who watches the play of social forces. The tendency of Shaftesbury's writing is to make all nature the true art-object; artificiality is abolished and the phenomena of character and sociology are included in the conception of nature. A study of his ethics from the aesthetic point of view leads us to the following estimate of the chief points: Proportion, symmetry, and related aesthetic notions are ap plicable to moral phenomena. These aesthetic notions depend upon the native structure of the mind and constitute our moral sense. Virtue con- sists in preserving a due proportion in the affections; it produces harmony and happiness. The highest good is harmony on the highest plane of cul- ture. It consists in a pure enjoyment of all nature, and demands stoical per- fection. ' Natural' means symmetrical in relation to egoism and altruism, on whatever level of culture. Common sense is nature on a middle level. As a criticism, it may be said that in his exoteric ethics Shaftesbury does not exaggerate the value of aesthetic form, but he fails to recognize that those evolutionary activities which oppose form and destroy harmony on one level, lead to form and harmony on a higher level. He understood adequate forms, but did not understand provisional forms. C. M. STORY.</page><page sequence="10">No. 2.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 197 Les firincizies moraux du droif. C. DUNAN. Rev. de Met., IX., 6, pp. 700-726. Right may be defined as that which ought to be, an ideal truth which reason opposes to brute reality. Different conceptions of reason imply different conceptions of right; and since the former reduce themselves to two, empiricism and idealism, the problem of right has had two solutions- the empirical and the idealistic. The most characteristic of the empirical solutions is that of Hobbes; and if phenomenalism were true, the law of existence would make men irreconcilable enemies, as that thinker held. For the essential characteristic of the phenomenal order is that in it things mutually exclude one another. But admitting that our existences have a substantial ground, the multiplicity of beings becomes reconcilable with the unity of the creation, and the antagonism of our appetites with the solidarity of our destiny. Empirical philosophy, knowing only facts, or what is, can- not derive from them the notion of right, or what ought to be. Idealism,' on the contrary, conceives of right as a morally necessary idea-not con- ditionally necessary, but absolutely so, anterior to experience, and superior to the mathematical and logical order on which the laws of nature depend. This moral necessity must, however, express itself within the facts of ex- perience, and this it can never do completely since nature entirely spiritual- ized would not be nature. That is, right is an idea appertaining to the moral order-and nothing moral has part among the things that are, in the sense that experience gives to that word. That right may embody itself in experience, two conditions are necessary: first, that it should define itself by taking as fixed a form as possible for each individual; and second, that it should meet in the world of facts a force of intelligence which will sup- port it, and which will have power enough to make it triumph. But this supposes the coercion of one person by another, this legislation, and this the state. "I The rationale and function of the state is to restrain human passions, compel respect for justice, and secure the reign of right." But in that wide domain of action which the law cannot regulate, a state of war must exist between individuals, until the progress of the individual con- science disposes men to treat their fellows with a greater degree of justice and benevolence. GEORGIA BENEDICT. HISTORICAL. Lo/ze's Kausali/dtslehre. EDMUND NEUENDORFF. Z. f. Ph., CXVI, pp. 41-144. Hume derived the relation of cause and effect solely from experience. Kant thought causality was a concept of the understanding, though real causes were noumenal, and hence unknown. Fichte gave up the thing in- itself, because it was beyond causality. For Lotze, as for Herbart, the world of appearance was the effect of a real world. They attributed to causality a transcendental significance. Leibniz held to a plurality in</page><page sequence="11">i98 THE PHiLOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI. sensation, and Kant to a plurality in epistemology, while Lotze applied the concept of plurality to metaphysics. Transeunt causality was unsatisfac- tory, for it involved the view that single existences are rigidly substantial. He, therefore, thought causality was immanent, i. e., that one state is pro- duced from another state in the same existence. He recognized the uni- versality of mechanism, but it is not clear what his view of freedom was. The difficulty of telling how body affects mind, led him, at first, to think that their relation was different from the causality of material things. But again he says that any causality is inconceivable, and that cause and effect are for us two events in time. In the Me4'zthysics of 184I, he says the concept of causality cannot come from preceding concepts. The mind supplies the deficiency. Science is limited to the study of conditions, and the order of the world is due to the fact that things are part of one ground. The actuality of the ground is constituted by the metaphysical connection of causes, which is the result of purpose. Sometimes, however, he teaches the reality of the causal process, and that there is no external force, law existing only in the actual process. On the whole, his early position is in close accord with Geulincx's I occasionalism.' In the Microcosmus, how- ever, he stands nearer to Hume and Kant. 'Occasionalism' is here but the last word of the understanding, while reason is led to posit a unity of ultimate reality-for the reciprocal relations of all things demand an abso- lute monism. The commensurability of individual things depends upon their worth for the world process. Their relations are possible, because the unity is spiritual. Free immanent causality is found only in the human will, and all substances are ultimately spiritual. Individuals are effective, because they are centers of force of a spiritual absolute, and are both active and representative. The absolute produces one state from another in order to maintain a certain inner equilibrium. But as this process is continuous, the absolute remains forever unsatisfied. This process of equilibrium sometimes has its ground in the qualitative nature of the individuals; and, again, in the unity of the plan in which the individuals are mere moments. Its purpose is always ethical. But we cannot comprehend the greatness of this idea, nor the inner state from which it arises. From the standpoint of I occasionalism,' Lotze sometimes admitted qualitative distinctions between psychic and corporeal atoms, but, again, from the transcendental standpoint he regarded all as parts of one true being, which had sensation, feeling, and will, and was, indeed, the per- sonal God. So that his system is called by some, monism; by others, pluralism; and by still others a vacillation between the two. Though all individuals are parts of a single absolute, he denies pantheism, which he thinks cannot recognize individual values. Again, there are religious, aesthetic, and metaphysical influences which incline him to pluralism. For the human soul has worth, and things act reciprocally. This is think- able only in a monism, but actual only in a pluralism. This doctrine of being demands that reals stand in relation to other reals, and be able to</page><page sequence="12">No. 2.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 1,99 know and feel the value of their own states. The degree of reality de- pends upon the perfection of the thing, as with Spinoza. Relation to another is an essential element in being, as it is not with Leibniz. With his pluralility of reals, blended in a higher unity, Lotze thought he had reconciled the monism of Spinoza with the pluralism of Leibniz. In the Metafihysic of 1879 there is no important change in respect to the causal problem, but he reaches a kind of metaphysical scepticism. There is only a single standpoint for the consideration of being and becoming. The cause exhausts itself to produce the effect, and in the continual flow of reciprocity and becoming, the thing is reduced to a mere appearance. As in the Microcosmus, reciprocity leads to the idea of the infinite spiritual absolute. The tendency in the ontological and cosmological investigation is toward pantheism. He agrees with realism that there is a world of things outside the human ego, and with idealism that only spirits exist in the world. He does not show how the absolute can give a metaphysical place to personalities outside itself, but says that as this concerns the creation of reality, it is insoluble. He criticizes Leibniz's view of the best possible world, and calls attention to the functional importance of the indi- vidual in the world process. Is it purpose which is the ultimate principle of causality ? We do not know, for we do not understand the idea which is working itself out in the world. This is his metaphysical scepticism. In the Metatfhysics the concept of reciprocity requires monism alone. But yet he'does not entirely set aside the pluralistic view. The absolute is all, yet there are also individual existences. The solution of the causal prob- lem is not final. N. E. TRUMAN. Das Causaltroblem bei Hume und Kant. ROBERT REININGER. Kant- Studien, VI, 4, pp. 427-458. In this discussion of the relation between Hume and Kant, some of the important points are the following: (i) Hume approaches the problem of causality quite unprejudiced, whereas Kant is biased by his belief that if the objectivity of the causal principle is overthrown, natural science be- comes impossible. (2) Kant's investigation is much more far-reaching than Hume's. Hume considers merely the question as to the validity of our inferences from experience, accepting the uniformity of that experience as an ultimate datum. Kant seeks to analyze this datum and thus raises the question of the nature and possibility of experience. (3) Kant and Hume agree in holding (a) that all causal judgments are synthetic, and (b) that only experience can give us the relation between the particular cause and its effect. (4) It is essential to distinguish carefully two kinds of necessity in the causal relation: the internal necessity uniting a particular effect with a particular cause; and the external necessity (everything that happens must have some cause). Both kinds are recognized in the Treatise, but Kant's criticism of Hume is vitiated by his failure to distinguish them. He under-</page><page sequence="13">200 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI, stands Hume to have reasoned thus: The special causal relations are not cognizable a firiori, and hence are not necessary; but if the causal relation is not necessary in any special case, then it is not necessary in general that every event should have a cause. This interpretation is in part correct. It is true both that Hume's criticism of the causal concept begins with an analysis of the particular causal judgment, and that his doubt of the (ex- ternal) necessity of the causal principle was suggested by the impossibility of proving logically the (internal) necessity of the special causal relation. But Kant is mistaken in supposing that Hume makes the necessity of the causal principle conditional upon the possibility of deducing the principle a frior. Hume would have been quite satisfied if he could have given an empirical deduction, if he could have found an " impression " to furnish a basis for our idea of an active force. (5) It is one of Hume's great ser- vices that he pointed out the anthropomorphic origin of the idea of active force. He seems not to have seen, however, that our conception of force, instead of being a baseless assumption, rests upon our immediate con- sciousness in acts of volition. The fundamental thought of Kant's episte- mology, that objectivity is nothing but necessary subjectivity, has its ulti- mate ground in this natural projection of our Wiiiensgefiihi. Here, as in many other cases, we must be content to see "I the anthropomorphic char- acter of our Weitbegrof" without " being able to eliminate it." ELLEN BLISS TALBOT. L'Hternith des ames dans Za fihilosophie de Sfiinoza. V. BROCHARD. Rev. de Met., IX, 6, pp. 688-699 That the second half of Spinoza's Ethics, Pt. V, is not concerned with immortality in the ordinary sense of the word is clear from Prop. XXI, in which memory and imagination are regarded as not extending beyond the present life. Eternity of the soul is attributed by Spinoza solely to its essence; but the view that this eternity of essence is an impersonal eternity, or a mere reabsorption into the Universal Soul, seems to be overthrown by the following considerations: (i) Both divisions of Part V of the Ethics deal with man's happiness-the first half with his happiness in the present life, and the second half with blessedness in the life eternal. The first half is unmistakably concerned with the happiness of man as an individual and personal being; why suppose that the second half does not also treat of the individual ? (2) Expressions like ' blessedness,' ' salvation,' and ' glory' (Prop. xxxvi, Scholium), plainly refer to an existence in which the indi- vidual is still a self-conscious being. (3) The statement in Prop. xxiii, Scholium, "I we feel and know that we are eternal," shows that the knowl- edge of ourselves as eternal is analogous to an empirical intuition, and is therefore knowledge of a determinate being. (4) That the eternal essence of the soul is accompanied by consciousness is affirmed in several passages, among them being Prop. xxxiv, Scholium, Prop. xxx, and especially Prop. xxxi, Scholium, where Spinoza says that the more completely we</page><page sequence="14">No. 2.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 201 recognize things - under the form of eternity," the more completely are we conscious of ourselves and of God. The soul is not lost in the Divine, but is eternally present to itself (V, xxix, Sch.).-M. Hamelin has shown that between Spinozism and Greek philosophy there is a closer connection than is ordinarily supposed. Aristotle's statement that the soul is the form of the body differs little from the Spinozistic description of the soul as the idea of the body. But, as was shown above, M. Hamelin is mistaken in hold- ing that Spinoza adopted the Aristotelian view of immortality as impersonal and partial. Between Plato, too, and Spinoza there are points of similarity. The intelligible world of Plato is identical with the Spinozistic world of essences. But for Plato souls are not ideas of God; they are not infinite in number, and they are not, as for Spinoza, united to a body and indi- viduated by it, but can dwell in, and animate successively, the most diverse bodies. We must conclude, then, that the differences between Aristotle and Plato on the one hand, and Spinoza on the other, are so great that Aristotle and Plato cannot be regarded as the source of Spinozism. The two can be brought into connection only through an intermediary doctrine. This middle term we get in the philosophy of Plotinus, where we find for the first time the doctrine that souls have an individual and distinct exist- ence in the Universal Soul, prior to their existence in the body. Plotinus's transformation of the doctrines of Plato and Aristotle was possible only through the idea of the Infinite, an idea foreign to Greek thought, and of Oriental or Jewish origin. The God of Spinoza is not abstract and imper- sonal substance, but possesses, besides the two attributes of thought, and ex- tension, an infinity of attributes which escape us. However different God's will and understanding may be from ours, they are will and understanding nevertheless. And as Spinoza has nowhere spoken of ideas unaccom- panied by consciousness, or of the intelligible apart from intelligence, it is not unreasonable to suppose God possesses consciousness and personality.
