<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE WORLD AS WILL AND IDEA: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF AN AMERICAN DREAM AND MR. SAMMLER 'S PLANET nrfr Susan Glickman In his study Four Postwar American Novelists, Frank D. McCon nell remarks that Saul Bellow's literary preeminence was consolidated in the '50s, only to be challenged in the '60s by writers more radical, both in sentiment and style, than himself. Bellow seemed to have created a normative voice and vision against which others could measure themselves and against which they rebelled. McConnell suggests that Mr. Sammler 's Planet is Bellow's own recognition and ironic statement upon this emeritus status. Artur Sammler, his septuagenarian European hero living through the manic sixties in the heart of New York City, is unmistakeably a vision of his own fictive career, ignored or (worse) pensioned off by the very writing it has generated. ... In [Sammler's] question "Who had made shit a sacrament?" we can hear Bellow's own cultured, traditional revul sion against the scatalogical metaphysics of Mailer's An American Dream, Barth's Giles Goat Boy and Pynchon's V.1 McConnell's reading may seem mischievous, but it is persuasive, as long as one emphasizes the ironic distance apparent not only in the characteriza tion but also in the omniscient narration. Sammler is shown up from the start as a posturing and self-righteous figure: 'Frank D. McConnell, Four Postwar American Novelists (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1977), pp. 3-4.

From a sense of deference, from age, from good manners, he sometimes affirmed himself to be out of it, hors d'usage, not a man of the times. No force of nature, nothing paradoxical or demonic, he had no drive for smashing through the masks of appearances. Not "Me and the Universe."2 This passage, in the characteristic rhetoric of the book which at once cap tures Sammler's personal syntax and points up his pretensions, is revelatory both of his pride and of his self-deception. This is his avuncular role, the "age" and "good manners" subtly conveyed by the slight emphasis given to both the popular American slang and the familiar French ex pression to remind us that, just as their meanings are identical, so is there nothing new in the apocalyptic pretensions of the '60s generation. Mr. Sammler's been around; he's seen it all before. But at the same time the entire book is a testament to Sammler's unwearying preoccupation with "Me and the Universe" (the principle study of his old age being the mystical texts of Meister Eckhart) and to his grim fascination with "smashing through the masks of appearances." He is unrelentingly harsh in his analysis of other people and of the social games they play. To give him his due, he is quite aware of his own role as the prophet from the past, and, indeed, the fierceness of his scrutiny derives in part from a desire to discern some common humanity, some shared principles of be ing, which can join him to the human race from which he declares his independence. That he only has one eye has a double significance; it im plies a lack of perspective in how he views external reality (a roomful of ordinary college students in "his obstructed vision" becomes "a large, spreading, shaggy, composite human bloom" [MSP, p. 40]), but it also implies the ability to connect simultaneously with an inner reality. ("The damaged left eye seemed to turn in another direction, to be preoccupied separately with different matters" [MSP, p. 32.].) Mr. Sammler starts out alienated—as a survivor of the death camps, as a widower, as an old European afloat in the American cult of youth. But he doesn't believe in alienation. There is a plaintiveness, an elegiac tone in Mr. Sammler's Planet that cuts through the satire and reminds us that through the reveries of this pompous old man Bellow is concerned to examine very real questions of human survival in this century. More particularly, though Mr. Sammler's "planet" is earth, because he is also known as Uncle Sam(mler), it is really America that we are talking about; the same country Norman Mailer investigates in An American Dream. Norman Mailer would seem to be one of those proponents of shit as a sacrament, one of those apologists for despair whom Mr. Sammler derogates. In An American Dream, however, Mailer seems to be doing the same thing as Bellow: acknowledging and satirizing his own popular im age by creating a protagonist who is something of a caricature of himself 2Saul Bellow, Mr. Sammler's Planet (Greenwich, CT: Fawcett Books, 1970), p. 125. Subsequent references to this edition will be made parenthetically in the text as MSP. 570 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="3">and endowing him with those attitudes and beliefs most likely to enrage his critics. Stephen Rojack (the name "Stephen" may signal that this book is to be a portrait of the artist) has served in World War II, been involved in politics, been prominent on television, and "professes" ex istential psychology—all well-known aspects of the Mailer myth. These accomplishments are all heightened in the novel, where Rojack gains the Distinguished Service Cross, is elected to Congress, has his own televi sion show and a tenured teaching post, and actually succeeds in killing his wife and getting away with it. (Mailer is most notorious for having stabbed his wife after a party.) Not only does Mailer flaunt the excesses of his public persona in this novel; he also defies the critics by flaunting the excesses of his style, writing in magazine installments at a time when he might have been expected to settle down and write a "well-made novel." In fact, An American Dream is extremely well made as the fantasia it is, but nothing could be further from the deliberately high style of a writer like Bellow. What is most striking is that, despite their utter distinctness in style, An American Dream and Mr. Sammler's Planet have very similar narrative strategies, and very similar thematic concerns. In both books a secular Jewish intellectual spends a couple of wild days in New York City (2 lA days for Sammler, 1 for Rojack) confront ing a series of bizarre characters involved in violent and/or sexual ac tivities, while simultaneously dealing with the death of a loved one—the loved one who had made "the American Dream" possible for that hero (Elya Gruner for Sammler, Deborah Kelly for Rojack). Both books modulate constantly between naturalistic narrative, social satire, wild fan tasy, and intensely private meditation. Both heroes undergo a kind of religious pilgrimage that ends with them considering the body of a dead man on an autopsy table. Both stories include an heiress (Angela Gruner; Deborah Kelly), a "blond bombshell" (Angela again; Cherry Melanie), a black "Prince of Harlem" (the pickpocket; Shago Martin), sexual perverts (Walter Bruch; Barney Kelly and Bess Trelawne). The action of each includes the hero's relationship to his daughter, his feelings about sex, his brushes with the police, the university, business, and crime. Both books even end with the hero coming into money. Of course to relate the two novels in this way is to give nothing of the flavor of either and to distort the meanings of both. But it is interesting how many details overlap. Perhaps this is because so many of them come out of popular American iconography and represent the common wisdom about the state of the Union. It is also possible that Bellow deliberately raided Mailer's novel {Mr. Sammler's Planet came out in 1970, An American Dream in 1965) in order to make his critique of his rival's viewpoint more witty and more comprehensive. The moon is the central symbol in both these novels, maintaining MAILER AND BELLOW 571</page><page sequence="4">its traditional value as the borderline between time and eternity, the emblem of the realm of mortality and change, the seasons, the tides, and man's inner life. It also accrues particular resonances in each work. The moon is full throughout An American Dream, and the story begins with Rojack tempted by her spectral voice to commit suicide. He also remembers that the moon was full the night he killed four Nazis during the war, a turning point in his life wherein he gained personal insight into magic and instinct, and public acclaim as a war hero. Mr. Sammler emphasizes the traditional associations of the moon by quoting Milton and Shakespeare, the first from Comus (MSP, p. 91), a work in defense of chastity, and the second from Antony and Cleopatra (MSP, p. 180), a work in defense of erotic love. He has plenty of reason to be preoccupied with the moon because his daughter Shula has stolen an In dian scientist's manuscript on the subject, in memory of her father's former friendship with H. G. Wells. A good part of the plot is taken up by Sam mler's attempts to retrieve and return this work because the scientist, Govinda Lai, had hoped to publish it "by the time of the first moon landing" (MSP, p. 161). Moreover, all of Sammler's friends and rela tions are lunatic; Shula is described as "loony" (p. 24, p. 107), as is Wallace (p. 82; Sammler also calls him "dans la lune" at p. 88). The condition is epidemic—Sammler's acquaintance Feffer remarks at page 113 upon "all those guys running for mayor like a bunch of lunatics." (One of those guys of course was Norman Mailer.) But though the moon's effect on susceptible humanity is chaotic, in itself it stands for purity and containment. Thus Sammler, perplexed by his niece Angela's promiscui ty, is "pleasantly haunted by moon visions. Artemis—lunar chastity" (p. 64). He compares the old myths to Lai's new Utopian fantasy of an ascetic lunar colony. The moon serves in the novel as the central symbol for both the goal of advanced technology and the future of man. But, in Sammler's view, the technological advances appear to be occurring in a moral void and thus the future of man is uncertain.3 Rojack too connects the moon with the future of man and imagines that in the moonlit deserts of the west a "new breed of a man" is being born.4 But the moon for him is a symbol of sterility and waste, associated with the false paradise that is Las Vegas, and with charnel houses (AAD, p. 153). The "platinum lady" of the moon (p. 19) seems to be a per sonification of Rojack's death-wish, just as the other blond, Cherry, whom he immediately impregnates, is a manifestation of the life-force. Right after a vision of Deborah's "lone green eye" while walking the parapet, he looks up at the moon—"princess of the dead, I would never be free of her" (p. 242)—and it is impossible to tell whether "her" in this con 3M.

An American Dream invests the moon with the same qualities of madness and murder as its human characters and so attributes these qualities directly to lunar influence. In Mr. Sam mler's Planet, however, the term "lunacy" is used ironically, with a clear recognition that all the mythology about the moon is anthropomorphic and'stems from man's ignorance about himself and his universe. Hence the insistence on the moon as a scientific phenomenon in Lai's manuscript. For Lai, the moon symbolizes the salvation of man by science rather than his damnation by passion. This is perfectly in accord with Mr. Sammler's statement that "visions or nightmares for others [are] but for him daylight events, in full consciousness" (MSP, p. 126). Sammler makes this observation when he finally gives in to the sup pressed memory of having killed a Nazi soldier. His wartime experience was the complete inversion of Rojack's and reveals the other side of war. Whereas Rojack experienced in battle a perfect coordination of instinct and intelligence, a moment of total personal integration that he remembers with almost sexual satisfaction, Sammler killed his Nazi in a state of com plete brutalization and lack of control. He shot a naked and defenseless man after he had stripped him of the clothes and food that were all he really wanted. What is grand and visionary for Rojack is reduced to something mean and nasty by Mr. Sammler, a strategy in operation throughout Bellow's book. . . . the evident fact is that Mr. Sammler is the Jew who, after Hitler, cannot forgive the world, for he recognizes that its exterminations may be more pleasurable than its lusts. He has decided, not as the rabbis have decided but as Jewish novelists have decided in this first era of fiction by many Jews, that the "world" is a very bad place indeed. In God's absence human consciousness becomes the world.® The fact of World War II, the concentration camps and the genocide, is an essential proof of human evil for both Bellow and Mailer. They each began their literary careers confronting that war, Bellow in Dangling Man (1944) and Mailer in The Naked and the Dead (1948), and both come back to it as a metaphor for the existential condition of man. Their characters are usually offered the alternatives of total abdication of selfhood into regimentation or resistance to conformity—and resulting alienation. The relationship of war to peacetime totalitarianism is made clear in Sam mler's meditation on how Germany eliminated the Jews by institutionaliz ing murder: Man is a killer. Man has a moral nature. The anomaly can be resolved by insanity only, by insane dreams in which delusions of consciousness are maintained by organization, in states of mad perdition clinging to forms of business administration. Making it government work. (MSP, pp. 180-181) 'Alfred Kazin, "The Earthly City of the Jews," in Bright Book of Life (Boston, MA: Little Brown, 1971), p. 137. MAILER AND BELLOW 573</page><page sequence="6">The same association of Nazis, business, and government is apparent in An American Dream in the relationship between Ruta and Kelly, and in this regard it is significant that Kelly's fortune began in Army Surplus (AAD, p. 223). However, despite his analysis of the holocaust, Sammler is skeptical of blaming institutions for madness and murder and insists that people recognize their individual, as well as their collective, responsibility. Although institutions can be and are built to exploit people's weaknesses, "madness is the attempted liberty of people who feel themselves overwhelmed by giant forces of organized control. Seeking the magic of extremes" (MSP, p. 134). "The magic of extremes" is exactly the route to salvation pro posed by An American Dream. Certainly paranoia about public institutions can't go much further than it does in Mailer's fable, where the hero, having passed through the Military and the Government before the ac tion starts, proceeds to break off with High Society, Academia, and the Media, while opposing the Police, the Mafia, Big Business, and the Under world. Mr. Sammler is as disillusioned about powerful organizations as Rojack is, but his greatest terror is not of authority but of anarchy; not of external forces, but of internal emotional chaos. Although both Sammler and Rojack may be said to be "alienated from the emptiness of modern life" and so on, they attribute that empti ness to entirely different things. Sammler is concerned with the loss of civilized graces and of belief in human community that he sees in postwar society. He is enraged by the cult of primitivism, and his world is full of people degraded to the status of animals. Bruch is "apelike" (MSP, p. 58), Lai a "birdy man" (p. 186), Wallace "a kinky cat" (p. 83), and Sammler himself "cat-whiskered" (p. 72), sporting overhanging brows "as in some breeds of dog" (p. 8). Angela calls herself "a skunk" (p. 61), but to her father she is a "cow" (p. 74) and to her brother a "swine" (p. 171). The rather mild, domestic quality of much of this imagery sug gests how ordinary man's bestiality is—how inescapable a fact of everyday life. It is petty and utterly without glamor, but pervasive. And it is this that terrifies Sammler. Mailer uses as much animal imagery as Bellow does, but, whereas Bellow's is mostly of the barnyard sort, reducing human behavior to a squabble in a henhouse, Mailer's focuses on the wild carnivores of jungle and desert and elevates human wickedness to something spectacular. To Rojack, Deborah is a "lioness" (AAD, p. 16) whose apartment is a "pad ded jungle" (p. 44); her cruelty is like "sucking the marrow from a broken bone" (p. 22), and Shago also experiences her as a "cannibal" (p. 179). Cherry also is "pure cat" (p. 105), and when she and Rojack first make love it is "like animals . . . across a track of jungle" (p. 120). Indeed, all Rojack's meetings with others are described in such terms. It is mostly his nose that conveys such images to him, that tells him that Ruta is 574 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">an "alley rat" (p. 46), Deborah a "wild boar full of rut" (p. 38), Kelly "a big foul cat" (p. 203), and Shago in a "poisonous snake of a mood" (P- 173). Sammler's nose is equally active, noting the French perfume of the pickpocket (MSP, p. 13) as well as the slight "fecal carelessness" of Wallace (p. 82). The significance of the sense of smell for both writers is that it suggests a regression to a more primitive mode of perception and orientation. Language is efficient only on one level, elsewhere it is often safer to follow your nose.6 As cerebral as these men are, both are ultimately searching for some truth about human nature that can be felt instinctively rather than reasoned out. Rojack, with his "not inconsiderable thesis that magic, dread and the fear of death are the roots of motivation" (AAD, p. 15), is particu larly inclined to trust his nose as the organ of truth. Part of his lecture "On the Primitive View of Mystery" is quoted midway through the novel, and it elucidates this point. In contrast to the civilized view which elevates man above the animals, the primitive had an instinctive belief that he was subservient to the beasts of the jungle and the beasts of mystery. To the savage, dread was the natural result of any invasion of the supernatural: if man wished to steal the secrets of the gods, it was only to be supposed that the gods would defend themselves and destroy whichever man came too close. By this logic, civilization is the successful if imperfect theft of some cluster of these secrets, and the price we have paid is to accelerate our private sense of some enormous if not quite definable disaster which awaits us. (AAD, p. 150) The evidence of the novel demonstrates that Rojack subscribes to this "primitive" view. In contrast, Sammler holds to the "civilized view" that maintains that, far from being hostile to man's mastery of his en vironment, the powers of the universe support and encourage it. "Dread" for Sammler is not the apprehension of divine retribution but the glum expectation of human failure. Civilization will fail because of that in man which is still primitive. Like Freud in Civilization and Its Discontents, like Marx, like most Western humanists, Sammler believes in the deferral of personal gratifica tion for long-term moral pleasure. He believes, that is, in the worth of the "social contract" and in the existence of the common good and is devoted to the Aristotelian ideal of the "Polis." Appropriately enough, in his youth he was associated with the "Cosmopolis Project for a World State," which he describes as having been envisaged as "a service society based on a rational scientific attitude towards life" (MSP, p. 41). He is now disenchanted with science, as his conversations with the Utopian theorist Govinda Lai make clear, but unlike Lai he has not given up on the possibility of creating a better world for man here on earth. (Perhaps 6Tony Tanner, "On the Parapet," in Will the Real Norman Mailer Please Stand Up?, ed. Laura Adams (Port Washington, NY: Kennikat Press, 1974), p. 132. MAILER AND BELLOW 575</page><page sequence="8">it is worth noting here that Dr. Gruner's fortune, which enabled him to support Sammler, was derived from real estate. See p. 72.) Indeed, it is because he no longer believes in science that he cannot imagine Lai's lunar colony redeeming mankind. ... his personal idea was one of human beings conditioned by other human beings, and knowing that present arrangements were not, sub specie aeternatis, the truth, but that one should be satisfied with such truth as one could get by approximation. Trying to live with a civil heart. With disinterested charity. With a sense of the mystic potency of mankind. (MSP, pp. 125-126) Even the title of Bellow's book, Mr. Sammler's Planet, suggests that the work will be concerned with universal issues and that in it the in dividual will be related to the world of which he is a part. It is appropri ately narrated in the third person. On the other hand, An American Dream, as its title makes clear—a version of the dream, not the popular one—is a much more private vision and hence told in the first-person voice. Mailer has, in all his works, "made some drastic disavowal of the Polis as the scene and setting of human existence"; he insists instead "on the politics of social reconstruction being superceded by a politics of salvation."7 This politics of salvation is dramatized in an exaggerated form in the novel: the secular intellectual, bogged down in inauthentic social roles, undergoes a redemption by fantasy and instinct. The thesis is explicated at length in Mailer's famous essay of 1957, The White Negro, which elevates the hipster to the status of existential hero and superman. The hipster's search for an authentic, better, or transcendent self is primarily by way of sex, the Reichian path to the instinctual unconscious. In this regard Mr. Sammler's reminiscence of Schopenhauer—after whom he was named "Artur"—is instructive. According to Schopenhauer in The World as Will and Idea, only ideas are not overpowered by the Will—the cosmic force, the Will, which drives all things. A blinding passion. The inner creative fury of the world. (MSP, p. 191) This is the power that Mailer worships, recognizing like Schopenhauer that "the organs of sex are the seat of the Will" (MSP, p. 191). Thus Mailer declares that to be with it is to have grace, is to be closer to the secrets of that inner unconscious life which will nourish you if you can know it, for you are then nearer to that God which every hipster believes is located in the senses of his body . . . God; not the God of the churches but the unachievable whisper of mystery within the sex. The paradise of limitless energy and perception just beyond the next wave of the next orgasm.8 For Mailer, the pursuit of spiritual fulfillment is best expressed by a sexual metaphor; he is not just using sexual language metaphorically but 7Nathan A. Scott, Three American Moralists (Notre Dame, IN: The University of Notre Dame Press, 1973), p. 94. 8Norman Mailer, The White Negro (San Francisco, CA: City Lights, 1957), p. 12. 576 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">imagining that sex itself is something of a physical analogue for a spiritual reality. He holds that the only experience of eternity accessible to man is the suspension of time and loss of personality one has in orgasm. The problem with the pursuit of God "beyond the next wave of the next orgasm" is that such a quest is radically private, and for Bel'ow the truly religious goal is somehow to integrate this ecstatic private self with the suffering public self. The only way to do this, to transcend the insatiable "Will," is by means of "Ideas." Ideas can accommodate the dialectic of instinct and ethic; the will can tolerate no compromise. Thus if Mailer's God is energy and his experience of God orgasm, Bellow's divinity is Mind, and his experience of it, thought. These fairly serious propositions are the foundation for the fantasy and satire in both novels; neither author appears to want to be taken too seriously. So Bellow's intensely sincere refutation of Mailer's ethic in The White Negro is put into the mouth of a testy, one-eyed old refugee, who seems to have racist tendencies and has just been sexually harassed by a black pickpocket.9 It ispossible that Feffer points us in the direction of Mailer's essay when he tells Sammler, "You're wise but not hip" (MSP, p. Ill), and Sammler seems to be referring to it when he complains that "the mental masses" "inheriting everything in a debased state had formed an idea of the corrupting disease of being white and the healing power of black" (p. 34). Sammler is particularly disturbed by "the peculiar aim of sexual niggerhood for everyone" (p. 149). Leslie Fiedler holds that "the negro is the Jew's archetypal opposite, representative of the impulsive life even as the Jew is the symbol of the intellectual."10 This observation applies to Mailer's and Bellow's novels, in both of which a Jewish intellectual is threatened by a sexually powerful Negro, and in both of which the Negro is severely beaten in retaliation. Both the pickpocket in Mr. Sammler 's Planet and Shago Martin in An American Dream are ambivalently seen as "African Prince or great black beast" (MSP, p. 77). Both are exquisitely dressed; both are members of the underworld (the pickpocket through crime, Shago by his profession as jazz musician); and both are cut off from white society by their speech habits as well as their color (the pickpocket doesn't speak at all; Shago spouts a weird hipsterese). The presence of both men is experienced as irresistably sexual; Sammler is fascinated by the pickpocket and goes to Columbus Circle a dozen times to seek him out. He notes every detail of the man's clothing, his body contours, even his smell, and, when the man retaliates for Sammler's spying, the sexual connotations are un indications of a rather trivial racism on Sammler's part are his scorn of Angela for contributing to ''defense funds for black murderers and rapists" (p. 14) and of Wallace for wishing "to be of use to little black children, to be a basketball coach in playgrounds" (p. 89). In the light of these remarks it is amusing that Sammler himself is persuaded into giving a talk at Columbia "for a student project to help backward black pupils with their reading problems" (p. 38). 10Leslie Fiedler, Waiting for the End (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1964), p. 107. MAILER AND BELLOW 577</page><page sequence="10">mistakeable. The pickpocket propels the old man through the lobby of his apartment building, "pressing him bodily, belly to back. He did not lift his hands to Sammler but pushed" (MSP, p. 48) before finally expos ing his penis to Sammler in defiance. The intimacy of this encounter parallels that between Shago and Ro jack in An American Dream, where sexual rivalry over Cherry gets trans formed into a suppressed homosexual encounter. Rojack takes Shago "from behind" (AAD, p. 181) to fight with him and then smashes him up and down on the floor before throwing him out the door, "getting a smell of full nearness, as if we'd been in bed an hour" (p. 182). His symbolic emasculation of Shago is complete when he retains the black man's umbrella as a talisman, appropriating some of Shago's powers with it. Rojack stops himself from killing Shago, but his rage is enacted fatally upon the singer through a third party who beats his head in with an iron bar. This incident is mirrored in Mr. Sammler 's Planet when Sammler begs Eisen to intervene in the scuffle between Feffer and the pickpocket, and Eisen proceeds to smash the Negro's face with a bag full of iron medallions. Sammler succeeds in preventing Eisen from killing the man, but he is unable to argue with his son-in-law about the necessity for such violence because, as Eisen reminds him, You can't hit a man like this just once. When you hit him you must really hit him. Other wise he'll kill you. You know. We both fought in the war. You were a Partisan. You had a gun. So don't you know? (MSP, p. 266) This alludes to Sammler's own cold-blooded murder of the German soldier in Zamosht forest and is a reminder that he has enacted his own violence vicariously through Eisen. The vicious stupidity of Eisen is immensely depressing to Sammler because he has no antidote for it and because he knows where it comes from, having been once equally brutalized himself. The pathetic aspect of the whole encounter—after all, the man was only a pickpocket and not a killer—is pointed up by its echo in one of the other plots. Shula's stealing of Lai's manuscript and her attempt to seduce him by dressing up in a sari represent a comic and feminine version of the pickpocket exposing first his theft and then his genitals to Sammler. When associated with the eroticism of Angela and the shady deals of Wallace and Feffer, the implication seems to be that sex and violence have become means of "expressing oneself' in this society. Though Rojack boasts that he feels good about having beaten Shago (AAD, p. 184), he knows that his actions have been cowardly and de meaning, and that he has not fought fair. There is a further suggestion that this fight is a turning point for Rojack: the point at which his luck goes bad. It had all gone wrong again. I could feel the break in the heavens. If I could have taken 578 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="11">some of it back, I would have returned to that moment when I began to beat Shago to the floor and he dared me to let him go. [AAD, p. 184) The later murder of Shago—which seems to have been inspired in part by Rojack's "evil eye" and which Rojack witnesses telepathically through the umbrella—results in Cherry's death, a mistaken retaliation by Shago's friends. Furthermore, Rojack feels a voice telling him all night to go to Harlem if he wants Cherry to live, but he resists it, the implication being that he could have prevented Shago's death, and thus Cherry's, had he been there. So by refusing to confront Shago honorably, and with him "some hard-lodged boulder of fear [he] had always felt with Negroes" (p. 182), Rojack loses Cherry and his chance for real love. The beating of the black man is something of a climax in Mr. Sam mler's Planet also. Not only is it the culmination of an action begun in the opening moments of the book, but it is one of a series of events that waylay Sammler, when he is desperately trying to get to the deathbed of his nephew Elya Gruner. Because Gruner's doctor is a little vague about the actual time of death (MSP, p. 283), there is the possibility that it took place while the beating was occuring, the explosion of violence on the street paralleling the hemorrhage in Elya's brain. If Elya Gruner's aneurysm is a metaphor for the hidden violence Sam mler fears in American life, cancer is the explicit metaphor for Rojack's perception of his country's sickness. In fact, violence is seen by Rojack as the antidote to the cancer of conformity: in the first scene, when he decides not to commit suicide, he thinks If I died from a revolt of the cells, a growth against the design of my organs, . . . this was the moment it all began; this was the hour when the cells took their leap. (AAD, p. 20) Cancer is everywhere in this novel. Rojack's spontaneous lie that Deborah had cancer turns out to be true; Eddie Gannuci is riddled with it, and after leaving New York Rojack lands up at the autopsy of a cancerous man in Missouri. The stench of putrifying flesh stays with him for the rest of his trip out west, and one can't help but feel that the dead man represents the corpse of the American Dream. Both Rojack and Sammler are themselves twice-born, brought back from the dead. Sammler literally crawled out of a mass grave in Poland; Rojack undergoes a kind of metaphysical rebirth after murdering his wife. Killing Deborah is symbolic of killing the evil in himself. From their rebirths the two men go on opposite routes to salvation—Sammler has to strive to reconnect himself to mankind and Rojack to disconnect himself from it. If Sammler is trapped inside himself, Rojack has no "self' at all, only a series of social roles to be divested. Rojack's predicament is that he has accepted "The American Dream" at face value; the novel shows how this fantasy of wealth and power is in fact a nightmare. Deborah personified this dream for her husband. MAILER AND BELLOW 579</page><page sequence="12">"With her beside me, I had leverage. ... I was one of the more active figures in the city—no one could be certain finally that nothing large would come of me" (AAD, p. 24). However, what Deborah really turns out to be for Rojack is a succubus, the nightmare who comes to men in sleep. More than once had I sat up in a strange woman's bed feeling claws on my chest, a familiar bad odor above the liquor on my tongue and Deborah's green eyes staring at me in the dark, an oppression close to strangling on my throat. (AAD, p. 40) Through her Rojack has sold his soul to the Devil, represented in America by her father, Barney Kelly, the control center for institutional evil in finance, politics, and crime. In the final scenes of the novel, Kelly is revealed as the "adversary" (the literal translation of "Satan") whom Rojack must fight to redeem himself. In fact there are traces of the tradi tional Christian tripartite scheme of temptation in An American Dream, with Deborah representing "The World," Ruta—in whose body the war be tween God and the Devil is symbolically waged—"The Flesh," and Kelly "The Devil." That Rojack succeeds in opposing all three powers and in appropriating their various talents indicates his new mastery over himself. Nonetheless he is unable to preserve the life of the woman he loves because it is impossible for even the pure in heart to combat all the evils in America at once; he cannot be at the Waldorf and down in Harlem at the same time. So at the end of the book he leaves America, having travelled to Las Vagas, the false paradise glimpsed during inter course with Ruta (p. 49) rather than having attained the heavenly city envisioned when he kills Deborah (p. 35) and makes love to Cherry (p. 122). Because of its purgatorial motif, An American Dream has been com pared by several critics to Bunyan's Pilgrim's ProgressSimilarly, Robert Dutton notes in Mr. Sammler's Planet the many "Vanity Fairs" and "Sloughs of Despond" that "the Pilgrim Sammler encounters on his pro gress toward Elya Gruner and religious affirmation."12 The religious strain in Mr. Sammler's Planet is not as overtly allegorical as that of Mailer's novel, but nonethless Sammler is a devotee of Meister Eckhart, is preoc cupied with religious questions throughout the book, and concludes it in prayer. Sammler's prayer insists that deep down we all know "the terms of our contract," that there does exist a foundation of truth and per manence in human life and it is to be found in fulfilling our bond toward others. There is a curious parallel to this longing for normalcy and cer titude in An American Dream when Rojack imagines himself praying to be rid of magic. "The critics who have argued most persuasively for this analogy are Barry Leeds in The Structured Vision of Norman Mailer (New York: New York University Press, 1969) and Jean Radford in Norman Mailer: A Critical Study (New York: Harper and Row, 1975). ,2Robert R. Dutton, Saul Bellow (Boston, MA: Twayne, 1971), p. 162. 580 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="13">"God," I wanted to pray, "Let me love that girl and become a father, and try to be a good man, and do some decent work." (AAD, p. 153) Richard Poirier wryly observes "the nearly hippie simplicity with which he would replace his hip embattlement. "13 Even Cherry, the tough nightclub singer, reveals that deep down she wants to have a baby and "be a lady" (p. 187). There is a certain pathos to these confessions of ordinary human expectations within the context of the novel, but they should remind us that it is, after all, a surreal dream vision and not an alternative reality. The major difference in the religious pattern in the novels resides in the different conceptions the two novelists have of God. For Bellow, God is the realm of "Ideas" that Schopenhauer suggested transcends the brute generative energy of the "Will." He seems to posit enduring and absolute values as innate in human consciousness. Mailer, on the other hand, sees God as a vulnerable figure and the universe as the battleground of good and evil. In the Paris Review interview of Winter 1964, Mailer was asked if there was "a hidden pattern being worked out in [his] books." He replied, "I have some obsession with how God exists. Is he an essen tial God or an existential God; is he all powerful or is he too an embat tled existential creature who may succeed or fail in his vision."14 An American Dream is shaped according to the existential premise, whereas Bellow's novel takes the essentialist view. What this also seems to involve is Mailer's insistence that in order to combat the Devil, man must not only acknowledge but exploit and express the evil in himself, whereas Bellow remains firm that humanity must learn somehow to overcome that evil without acting it out. The radically different, even opposite, stances Mailer and Bellow take on the issues of man's place in nature and society, the character of the religious quest, the function of evil, and the roles of will and intellect make them the Blake and Wordsworth of modern American letters. Bellow's novels in great detail and at great length map "the growth of a poet's mind," whereas Mailer's intention seems to be to write, like Blake, a Bible of Hell. Bellow always makes clear the isolation of the individual and the privateness of his imaginative life—and then tries to find in that private imagination proof of the essential unity of mankind. This pattern is very similar to that charted by Geoffrey Hartman with reference to Wordsworth: the conversion of "apocalypse," or the utter separation of man from nature, into "akedah," or the binding down of man into nature.15 But Mailer is emphatically a prophet of apocalypse, "Richard Poirier, Mailer (London: Wm.

He refers us to Heidegger's concept of "Gelassenheit," which he defines as "a quiescent submission to the multilevel ed and radical mystery of existence, the way of falling into peace" (p. 134). 582</page></plain_text>
