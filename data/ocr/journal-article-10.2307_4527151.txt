<plain_text><page sequence="1">ONCE MORE THE "GOLDEN MAN" BY JAMES R.

Behind this unelaborated remark of the Father of Chinese History lie details related by the commentators 5): [ 5] ' 1) This will correct my own interpretations offered in iP 30 (1933), 109-1 10 and Professor H.H. Dubs' translation in TP 33 (1937), 7-8 (see also 191-2). 2) For the present commtunication it is unimportant whether &amp; means gold or metal or gilded. Furthermore, I leave aside all coDsideration of number and interpret throughout in the singular. But cf. TP 30. 108, n. 6 and TP 33. 5, n. 1 (and p. 192). 3) We can hardly accept Professor Dubs' reason (p. 4, n. 2) for not following the special reading given by the commentator for the second character in this name. One must choose between three alternatives: (1) follow the text as it stands, (2) accept the modifications of commentators, or (3) determine the ancient or archaic pronunciation of both svllables in the name and use it in that form. It is customary to follow the commentator. 4) [The reading in the Han-shu, omitting p'o , is preferable; p'o is probably a gloss on the previous sentence telling about the capture of more than 8000 heads; cf. Wang Ydn's I Af Shih-chi C(hiao , (1828), reprint of Palace Museum, 1935, ch. 2, p. 19a. J. J. L.

Ssu-ma Chen: 'Wei Shao says, '[They] made a golden man and used it as a tablet for worshipping Heaven.' Ts'ui Hao says, 'In worshipping, the barbarians used the golden man as a tablet. The present-day golden Buddhist statues are an example [of this practice]'. Moreover'), the Han shu yin i says that 'the golden 1) This phrase is difficult. I can only suggest that it may be an abbreviated form of X i72 4&gt; Av that may have appeared elsewhere in the Han shzc. If we compare Chang Shou-chieh's final remark (see below), we might translate: "[It] was a man [statue] for worshipping Heaven." As a final alternative I would suggest that it might be an attempt to clarify the difficult &amp; )A X X (see note 1 on next page) which may have been the text in M8ng K'angs Han Shn. In this last case I should prefer the alternative translation just given in this note. [The difficulty of this passage, in my opinion, is solved by following the reading of the famous Wu-ying-tien edition of 1747, which reads (reprint of the Chung-hua Shu-chui, vol. 21, ch. 110, p. 18a): I"- 4; , 4 X X k X X~ 3jt -Ift . The character instead of " in the other texts is obviously the result of dittography. The period comes before and not after and this character should not be taken as a noun "image", but as a verb "to resemble, to represent". The translation of the entire passage should therefore be: "That is why the Hsiu-ch'ul were in the possession of the golden man (i.e. statue) for worshipping Heaven. It was (a thing that) represented a tablet for worshipping Heaven". The sarne reading is given in the edition of Ch'en Tzii-lung VA T M (izii: Wo-tzu I . 1608-1647) dated 1640. J. J. L. D.] 2) It will be noticed that P'ei Yin merely quotes. He himself says nothing. 3) Professor Dubs takes all of this part of the So-yin through X :4 A (but notice the difference in his text; see note 2 on previous page) as belonging to Ts'ui Hao. Professor Eliss6eff has called my attention to an article in the Sankagakuho A g A " (No. 10, p. 5, Tokyoi, 1918) by Otani Shiishin ) 4 J j who interprets this sentence in the same way. I must beg, however, to differ with them. Even without the enlarged So-yin now at our disposal, I should take the phrase f " T- t #P as belonging to Ssii-ma Ch8n. For an example of this sort cf. Shih chi 113. 3al where Ssui-ma Chen quotes authorities, criticizes them, and then enunciates his own concluision with an introductory : comment upon the J in ' As for the true So-yin to this passage, i.e., the So-yin as I quote it above, a brief examination of other remarks by Ssui-ma Chen will show similar uses of and a tendency to quote as Meng K'ang rather than Han sha yin i (but the book name</page><page sequence="4">ONCE MORE THE "GOLDEN MANr 177 man and [the place for] worshipping Heaven 1) were 2) originally at the foot of Mt.

I fear that this account [by Meng K'ang] is untrue 4). It is my opinion ') that they got the occurs in the So yin for Shih chi 116. 2 1l:1, only in Knang-ya 25.6b 11, Chin-lig 116.3b7, and Takigawa 116. 97). I have not noticed any similar use of 7 . Yet even if the remark i * &amp; is to be attributed to Ts'ui Hao (but I do not believe it), from * on we must recognize a statement by Ssui-ma Ch8n. See below. 1) I see no other way to translate this phrase. If we could invert to chi t'ien chin jen, we should have the quotation f-om the Ban shu upon which M8ng K'ang is com- menting. Or is this really what his Hanz shn read? See note 1 on previous page. It will be remembered that the commentaries originally circulated separately, and that they quoted from the origitial texts otuly those portions which inspired remarks. For an example consult the edition of the Shih chi so yin mentioned above in note 2 on p. 175. Or is the chin je'n a mistake for Isizeng-nn? [Most likely the two characters + A have slipped in from the text that was being commented and crowded out the characters X1j 4 which we find in the lusn-shn.yin-yi reading as preserved by the Chi-chiek. I believe therefore that one is justified in emending the text and translating: "(The 1lace where) the Hsiung-nu sacrificed to Heaven" etc. J. J. L. D.] 2) It will be noticed that Ssli-ma Cbhen is quoting the Han shu yin i slightly in a6bregeg. Is this the reason for the ? Cf. the same authority as quoted bv P'ei Yin, above. This produces a text which is susceptible to slightly different translation. If, however, P'ei Yin's quotation is considered better, it is the translation given there that should supersede the translation given here from Ssii-ma Chdn. 3) [The text should be corrected in accordance with my suggestion supra p. 176. note 1, and the punctuation and translation changed accordingly. J. J. L. D.] 4) Ssti-ma Chen (maybe, Ts'ui Hao) is probably objecting to the story of the peregrinations of the golden man. M8dog K'ang, however, says nothing whatsoever about Buddhist statues, so that Professor Dubs' translation (p. 7, n. 1) is logically impossible 5) At this point Professor Dubs has gone conmpletely astray. In addition to the logical difficulty mentioned in the previous note we are now confronted with a lexical one. The character x is used too constantly to introduce the remarks of a coinmentator for me to stop to demonstrate the fact. Furthermore, Dubs' translation would require g; yet he suggests no change in the reading, and, in fact, none is necessary. Otani (see note 3 on p. 176) reads this character ansitrnni, not izukunzo, which would be the reading for an interrogative * EElisseeff].

Chang Shou-chieh: 'The Kua ti chih reads: 'The temple to the Spirit [read iji #jij of the Ching-lu was at the foot of Mt. Kan-ch'iian, 90 1i NW of Yiin-yang Hsien in Yung Chou.

In my opinion, as for the golden man, present- day statues of Buddha are its carry-over 2). [The Hsiung-nu] set it up as a tablet for worshipping Heaven". Thus none of the Shih chi commentators identifies this "golden man" with Buddhist statues. Chang Shou-chieh, Ts'ui Hao, and Yen Shih-ku * Ojfi W (Han shu 94A. 8b8) are merely reminded of Buddhist statues by the mention of this "golden man". It does remain, however, that others identified it as Buddhist. Chang Yen') 'k: ! (middle of third ceDt. A.D.) said of this statue, "a Buddhist shrine golden man" 4g ; A tt . In the middle of the sixth centurv A.D. Wei Shou claimed that the arrival of this statue "was a 'seeping-in' due to the circulation of Buddhism" t M4 That is, he believed this was a Bud- dhist statue. 1) There looms here a disconcerting textual problem. The complete editions of the So-yin agree upon the text as I have given it. The abridged editions agree in reading at this point j , "Buddhist". I believe that we mnust follow the unabridged editions. 2) Chang Shou-chieh is non-committal. For him this golden man and statues of Buddha belong to the same class. He does not say that they are identical. 3) This man, reputed author of a Hsi hlazz shu yin shih Is ' &amp; AM is assigned to the 3rd cent. A.D. Cf. lin shu 5a. 3bl0 and Shih chi, 111. 3h13.
