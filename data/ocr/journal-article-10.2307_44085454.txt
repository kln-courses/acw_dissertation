<plain_text><page sequence="1">STEVEN L. DRIEVER The Signification of Sorian Landscapes in Antonio Machado's Campos de Castilla As the twentieth century closes, many agree that literature must in- form the growing concern over human survival.1 The rootless mod- ern must develop a sense of place, including an aesthetic apprecia- tion of even the most modest environs. The landscape literature of Spain's Generación del 98 (Generation of 98), a group of young writers concerned with the regeneration of Spain after its defeat in the Spanish- American War of 1898, serves as one source of inspira- tion for this turnabout. Lain-Entralgo, a Spanish psychiatrist turned cultural critic, maintained that the Generation of 98 discovered and invented the Castilian landscape (Hutman 114). According to him, these writers discovered it by communicating a vision of beauty in its severe, bold lines, and they invented it by portraying its con- nections to the Spanish psyche. Or, as Shaw succinctly wrote, they meditated upon the landscape, "underscoring its symbolic value and soul" (209). A complete list of the generational writers who pub- lished on what Ortega y Gasset, the brilliant Spanish philosopher and essayist, called "la razón geográfica de cada lugar" (the geographic reason of each place) would be quite long; a few of the more im- portant names are Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo, Ángel Ganivet, Pío Baroja y Nessi, José Martínez Ruiz (better known by his pen name, Azorin), and Antonio Machado y Ruiz (Serrano Poncela 176). Of that group, only Machado (1875-1939) is considered to have been first and last a poet. Machado is generally credited with making a major</page><page sequence="2">44 ISLE contribution to the rebirth of lyrical poetry in Spain and with being the first Spanish poet to make the landscape a central theme. Because of the difficulty of rendering Spanish verse into English, Machado is not sufficiently known in the English-speaking world. The few Spanish/ English editions of his poetry include only se- lected poems. Trueblood's is probably the best of the lot, and even he acknowledged omitting some poems simply because of their resis- tance to "Englishing" at his hands (viii). In spite of this difficulty, more than a few of the literati have long considered Machado to be a universal poet. Rubén Darío, the great Nicaraguan poet, wrote that, among lyrical writers, Machado was "uno de los más cosmopolitas, uno de los más generales, por lo mismo que lo considero uno de los más humanos" (one of the most cosmopolitan, one of the most uni- versal, for the same reason that I consider him one of the most hu- man) (Phillips 181). José Augusto Seabra, a Portuguese poet and es- sayist, recently included Machado in "el Panteon de los grandes poetas tutelares que pertenecen a la humanidad entera" (the pan- theon of the great tutelary poets who belong to all of humanity) (Sesé 373). Others also have heard and felt the deep resonance of his lyrics (Orozco Díaz). Antonio Machado published five major books of poetry: Soledade (Solitudes), 1903; Soledades , galerías y otros poemas (Solitudes, Galler- ies, and Other Poems), 1907; Campos de Castilla (Fields of Castile), 1912; Nuevas canciones (New Songs), 1924; and Poesías completas (Com- plete Poems), 1917. Machado incorporated poems composed after 1917 into later editions of his complete works (1928, 1933, and 1936), and in each edition of the Poesías completas he added some poems, discarded others, and rewrote selected verses. Machado's poetry in the first two books exhibited his evolving mastery of themes and symbols, showing his assimilation of the great poetry of the past, both Spanish and French. Although a case can be made for Ma- chado's poetry having gone through several changes in emphasis - subjective and symbolic, objective and concrete, and gnomic and philosophical - descriptive landscapes loom from his earliest po- ems to his very last. The character of the landscapes does change, however. Soledades and Soledades , galerías y otros poemas contain po- ems with mainly imaginary landscapes having real bases such as fountains, plazas, schools, and roads. This study focuses on the poetic presentation of the Sorian land- scapes in Campos de Castilla. Machado wrote the poems for Campos de</page><page sequence="3">Sorian Landscapes in Campos de Castilla 45 Castilla , a model of landscape poetry, between 1906 and 1917. In Poesías completas , these poems are numbered XCVII to CLII. (Some have numbers and titles but others only numbers for identification.) Because Machado's poetics usually took account of the landscape, poems in addition to those of Campos de Castilla are discussed in this paper when they are important to the proper interpretation of the Sorian landscapes. The page numbers cited for Machado's poems are from the Manuel Alvar edition of Poesías completas issued in 1991. All quotations are presented, if possible, in the original language, and if that is Spanish, my own translations follow. Before Machado penned any of the poems of Campos de Castilla , he had criticized the inwardness of many poets, particularly their indif- ference to the reading public. In 1904, Machado wrote to Unamuno, "No debemos crearnos un mundo aparte en que gozar fantástica y egoistamente de la contemplación de nosotros mismos" (We must not create a world apart in which we egoistically and unrealistically enjoy the contemplation of ourselves) (Sanchez Barbudo 171). As Machado turned away from the self-absorbed French symbolists and their like, he honed his ability to describe and to interpret the raw beauty of the arid Castilian landscape, the natural region most connected to the legendary conquests and reconquests of Spain and most central to the Spanish culture. His 1907 appointment to the cá- tedra (professorship) of French at the Instituto General y Técnico of Soria was integral to his development as a landscape poet. Before, Machado had lived in Seville and then, from the age of eight, in Madrid, except for two years (1899 and 1902) in Paris. In the provin- cial capital of Soria, then with only about 7,000 residents, Machado could walk in any direction and reach the Castilian countryside within minutes. Accounts of an older Machado in Baeza and Sego- via portray him as peripatetic, often walking for hours each day in the countryside (Cobb 30; Bly 1).2 The younger Machado probably walked at least as much. During his five years in Soria, Machado often strolled along the paseos (promenades) on both banks of the Duero River or along the walkways of the Alameda de Cervantes, a spacious and beautifully landscaped city park. In Soria, his frequent and intimate observations of landforms, flora, fauna, rivers, and other elements of nature were transformed into lyrical poetry. Some idea of the intensity of Machado's close communion with Castile is evident from a response in a 1937 interview. Comparing Castile to Valencia, where he then resided, Machado enthused:</page><page sequence="4">46 isle ¡Castilla es tan distinta! ... El hombre vive allí con ... los pies en el suelo, más la cabeza clavada en la infinitud del espacio. Castilla es la conquista, la expansión, la fe, lo absoluto. . . . ¡Castilla es el espíritu de España! (Pla y Beltran 43) Castile is so different! ... A man lives there with ... his feet on the ground and his head stuck in the infinitude of space. Castile is the conquest, the expansion, the faith, the absolute Castile is the spirit of Spain! Although some of the first poems that Machado wrote in Soria had stylized landscapes (for example, CXII, "Pascua de Resurrec- ción" [Easter] and CIX, "Amanecer de otoño" [Autumn Dawn]), most of his poems written in Soria develop concrete landscapes, often those unfolding during his daily walks. Here are passages from two of the many poems that could have been selected for illustration: He vuelto a ver los alamos dorados, alamos del camino en la ribera del Duero, entre San Polo y San Saturio, tras las murallas viejas de Soria - barbacana hacia Aragón, en castellana tierra. (CXIII, "Campos de Soria" [Fields of Soria] 172) I have again seen the poplars golden, poplars along the bank of the Duero between San Polo and San Saturio beyond the old city walls of Soria - barbican toward Aragon, in the Castilian land. Mediaba el mes de julio. Era un hermoso día. Yo, solo, por las quiebras del pedregal subía buscando los recodos de sombra, lentamente. (XCVIII, "A orillas del Duero" [Along the Duero] 151) It was mid-July and a magnificent day. Alone, I climbed along the clefts in the rocky slope, slowly, seeking out the shadowy bends.</page><page sequence="5">Sorian Landscapes in Campos de Castilla 47 Gonzalez has argued that Machado's Sorian poems affirm "lo otro" (the other) and implicitly deny the "yo" (I) (146). His argument, however, dissolves upon a perusal of these poems. In Soria, Ma- chado focused more on external than internal realities, but he based his writing on personal experiences, and he typically sought to syn- thesize the two realities as a poem progressed. Machado had a keen sense and appreciation of nature's cycles and rhythms. Typically, his Sorian poems begin with detailed ob- servations of the setting. Although I have taught earth science to col- lege students for nearly twenty years, I cannot find a single verse in the opening settings of the Sorian poems that contradicts scientific knowledge of nature. In fact, Machado's perambulations enabled him to garner specific knowledge about nature in actual places that far exceeds that displayed by the typical modern. Machado's feel for nature is nowhere more deftly displayed than in the haunting lyrics of poem CXXVI, "A José María Palacio" (To José María Palacio), which was fashioned in Baeza on April 29, 1913, as a letter to his one real male friend in Soria. It begins: Palacio, buen amigo ¿está la primavera vistiendo ya las ramas de los chopos del río y los caminos? En la estepa del alto Duero, Primavera tarda, ¡pero es tan bella y dulce cuando llega! . . . Aún las acacias estarán desnudas y nevados los montes de las sierras. (215-16) Palacio, my good friend, is spring already dressing the branches of the poplars by the river and along the roads? In the steppe of the upper Duero, spring shows late, but it is so lovely and gentle when it comes! Still the acacias must be bare and the mountain peaks covered with snow. This short passage clearly demonstrates his knowledge that spring in the high mountains to the north, west, and south of the city of</page><page sequence="6">48 ISLE Soria begins much later (about two months after) than in the valley of the Duero. Unfortunately for the interpretation of the poem, the word acacia could refer to any of various normative ornamental trees of the genus Acacia that are often planted in parks or along roads in Spain. The acacias also could be blackthorns ( Prunus spinosa ), small trees or shrubs often found on dry slopes in Spain, the kind of slopes bordering the promenade between San Polo and San Saturio. In any event, the comparison of the "dressing" of the poplar while the aca- cia remains bare reveals a fraction of Machado's knowledge about the sequence of plant growth during spring. At a time when poetry was posing various challenges to estab- lished conventions - the vers libre of Arthur Rimbaud, the eso- tericism of Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Valéry, the creationism of Vicente Huidobro and Pierre Reverdy, and the surrealism of Guil- laume Apollinaire - Machado toiled in established prosodies and preferred to use words with widely known referents. Perhaps this usually solitary and melancholy man knew that for him to connect more widely and enduringly with others, he had to write poetry that was readable to most people and refreshingly true to nature's rhythms. As Machado put it, "Un poema es ... un objeto propuesto a la contemplación del prójimo" (A poem is ... an object intended for the contemplation of one's fellow man) (Shaw 131). Or, as he wrote in 1904 to Unamuno, "No debemos huir de la vida para for- jarnos una vida mejor que sea estéril para los demás" (We mustn't flee from [this] life in order to forge for ourselves a better life that is sterile for others) (Pérez-Rioja 37). Machado assisted his readers by providing a short sketch of a particular situation or place, often at the front of a poem and based on his personal geographic experiences. He then often familiarized the reader with the landscape by employ- ing metaphors based on concrete phenomena or on important events or monuments in Spanish history. For example, the late spring of the high mountains becomes (Moorish) turbans of snow and storm in CU, "Orillas del Duero" (Banks of the Duero); the impending death presaged by autumn becomes a hunter walking between lean grey- hounds in CIX, "Amanecer de otoño;" and the struggle of the Chris- tians to retake the Iberian peninsula from the Moors is represented with Soria's crossbow curve of the Duero (the limit of the kingdom of Asturias under Alfonso III) in CXIII, "Campos de Soria." Machado's affinity for his fellow human supported his effort to create an atmosphere of shared feeling as a poem progressed. Then,</page><page sequence="7">Sorian Landscapes in Campos de Castilla 49 as the poem's end neared, Machado would try to draw the landscape into his soul. If the reader succeeds in identifying with Machado, he or she also experiences a spiritual connection with the landscape. The spirit of place, particularly of Soria, that Machado evoked in many of the poems of Campos de Castilla becomes deeply etched in the sensibilities of the reader. Machado communed with the land- scape because he knew that its external cover is but a thin layer be- tween life forces, both emotive and spiritual. And Machado knew that seemingly exhausted patches of the earth's cover can be quickly transformed into vital, if quiescent, places upon consideration of their histories and potential futures. Carpintero glimpsed only part of this complex of life forces when she wrote that Machado com- muned with the telluric essence of a landscape and understood how its soul was bound to the collective soul of the people whose lives are played out just above (83). Carpintero also erred in assuming that the collective soul of the people is always bound to the soul of the landscape. An individual or a community often forges a strong tie with the patria (homeland), which should be small enough to foster socioecological organization (Murphy 133). But if the bond is to be inseverable, the relationship between people and the land must be symbiotic; nourishment must flow in both directions. Machado knew that he had joined souls with Soria, though he was uncertain if the fusion occurred during his years in Soria or sometime before. In the final section of poem CXIII, "Campos de Soria," Machado evoked all of Soria and then declared, "Me habéis llegado al alma, / ¿o acaso estabais en el fondo de ella?" (You have made your way into my soul / or perchance you were already there deep within?). Ma- chado also knew that most of the people of Soria and all of the rest of Spain had long since ceased to connect spiritually with the patria. He implored his fellow citizens to nourish the patria by laboring in the fields and workshops, by digging in the mines, by replanting trees on deforested lands, and by advancing the national culture. In April 1908, Machado wrote an article to commemorate the centenary of the francesada, the French invasion of Spain in 1808. This piece was published in "La Prensa de Soria al 2 de mayo de 1908," a special publication of the three Sorian newspapers, and it reads in part: Sabemos que la patria es algo que se hace constantemente y se conserva sólo por la cultura y el trabajo. . . . Sabemos que no es patria el suelo que se pisa, sino el suelo que se labra; que no</page><page sequence="8">50 ISLE basta vivir sobre él: que allí donde no existe huella del esfuerzo humano no hay patria, ni siquiera región, sino una tierra estéril, que tanto puede ser nuestra como de los buitres o de las águilas que sobre ella se ciernen. (Molinero 88) 3 We know that the homeland is something that is constantly be- ing made and is preserved only through culture and labor. . . . We know that the homeland is not the ground that is tread upon, but the soil that is worked; that it is not enough to live on it: that where there is no sign of human effort, there is no home- land, nor even a region, but a sterile land that is no more ours than the vultures' or the eagles' that hover over it. Machado's communion with the physical environment strength- ened in the autumn of 1912 when he relocated to Baeza to accept the appointment to another cátedra , which he solicited after his young wife, Leonor, died in Soria on August 1, 1912. In part because of in- tense disappointment with Baeza, an old, architecturally impressive but culturally backward Andalusian city, Machado continued to be- lieve that Soria was his patria, a conviction he held for the rest of his life. However, Machado's physical distance from Soria shored up this loyalty at least as much as any nostalgia. Now the poet's soul could commune with the life force of the Sorian lands free of diver- sionary new sensations and undiluted by wanderlust. As John Elder has noted, the rooted relation of the poet with a place must also comprehend the larger world, including the realities of the waste- land (40). Machado resided in Baeza from the fall of 1912 to 1919 and wrote his finest landscape poems there. As a native Andalusian, Machado no doubt felt a responsibility to sing the countryside of Baeza, but usually these landscape images are overpowered by his dreams and recollections of Soria. For ex- ample, in poem CLVIII, "Canciones de tierras altas" (Highland Bal- lads), written in Baeza between 1917 and 1919, he penned: V Soria de montes azules y de yermos de violeta, ¡cuántas veces te he soñado en esta florida vega</page><page sequence="9">Sorian Landscapes in Campos de Castilla 51 por donde se va, entre naranjos de oro Guadalquivir a la mar! VI ¡Cuántas veces me borraste, tierra de ceniza, estos limonares verdes con sombras de tus encinas! ¡Oh campos de Dios, entre Urbión el de Castilla y Moncayo el de Aragón! (280) V Soria of blue mountains and lavender barrens, how many times have I dreamed you in this flowery lowland where the Guadalquivir flows past golden orange trees seeking the way to the sea! VI How many times, ashen land, have you obscured my view of these green lemon groves with shadows of your gnarled oaks! Oh, fields of God between Urbión in Castile and Moncayo in Aragon! In Baeza, Machado finally overcame what William Wordsworth called the tyranny of the bodily eye. Like Wordsworth, he now</page><page sequence="10">52 ISLE preferred the "soft ideal scene, / . . . slipping in between / The beauty coming and the beauty gone" (724). One of the contradic- tions in Machado's personal philosophy is that he conceived nature's life force to be eternal, that the patria drew sustenance from that life force, and that his soul was bound to the patria ; but though he tried, he could never believe in the immortality of his own soul. The interrelation of motifs in the poems discussed so far has been apparent, and this intertwining has led some critics to regard the entire Campos de Castilla as one poem (Guillen 479). This position is extreme because there is too much variation among the poems for them to be one. The similarities among the poems are numerous enough, however, to support the idea that Machado had developed a well-defined poetics before writing any of the poems of Campos de Castilla. Contrary to the false distinctions of some poorly informed critics, all of Machado's books of poetry suggest considerable sen- sitivity to landscapes. In his introduction to the Poesías completas , Alvar argues that Machado was inculcated with the ideals of Giner de los Ríos, founder of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which Machado attended from 1883 to 1889. Giner's Consideraciones sobre el desarrollo de la literatura moderna (Reflections on the Development of Modern Literature), 1862, included this definitive statement: Doble, por consiguiente, ha de ser el objeto de la creación artís- tica que aspire a vivir eternamente en la memoria de los pueb- los; debe, por un lado, referirse a las leyes necesarias de lo bello; por otro, al carácter de la civilización en que nace: lo inmutable y lo temporal, lo accidental y lo absoluto han de tener en ella representación (Machado 25-26). Consequently, artistic creation must have two objectives to live eternally in the memory of the people: on the one hand, it should refer to the essential laws of beauty; on the other, to the character of the civilization in which it comes forth: the im- mutable and the temporal, the accidental and the absolute should be represented in [the artistic creation]. There was ample opportunity for Giner to influence his disciple. Not only did he take his students on field trips to the Sierra de Guada- rrama to the north of Madrid, but he befriended Machado. Six days after Giner's death on February 18, 1915, Machado had completed his encomium, poem CXXXIX, "A don Francisco Giner de los Ríos" (To Don Francisco Giner de los Ríos). Though neither his first nor his</page><page sequence="11">Sorian Landscapes in Campos de Castilla 53 most lyrical eulogy, Machado placed it at the front of the "Elogios" (Praises) section in Campos de Castilla. Giner no doubt approved these verses in poem XCVII, "Retrato" (Portrait): "Adoro la hermosura, y en la moderna estética / corté las viejas rosas del huerto de Ron- sard" (I adore beauty, and in modern aesthetics / I cut the old roses from Ronsard's garden) (150).4 Although generally stark, Soria nevertheless is a provocative corn- page animated with relics and historical connotations central to the turn-of-the-century preoccupation of many Spaniards with the re- generation of their country. Most of the province is paramo, high arid or semiarid tablelands; even alongside the Duero the lowest eleva- tion is nearly 900 meters above sea level. Various sierras almost encircle the páramo and straddle the provincial boundaries (except to the west). Two of these mountain ranges are evoked repeatedly in the poems of Campos de Castilla : the Picos de Urbión, some 40 kilo- meters northwest of the city of Soria and over 2,200 meters above sea level, and the Sierra del Moncayo, about 50 kilometers east of the city and over 2,300 meters above sea level. Both are majestic and almost transcendent landmarks in the Machadian landscape, but they are different. Urbión looks like the zodiacal sign for Aries, but leaning backward about 45o and having successively shorter horns arrayed down the shaft. Glaciers filed and plucked Urbión into aretes, and the glacial meltwaters created limpid tarns in the cirques between the knifelike ridges. A local cool, humid climate supports an exotic covering of Western European (as opposed to Mediter- ranean) vegetation in which the dominant species is Scots pine ( Pi - nus sylvestris), a valuable source of timber. To most Spaniards, Ur- bión is an eerie place that is entered for wood or for refuge from summer heat. To Machado, Urbión and its environs were even more: places poetically enriched by an emotional tension created be- tween their seeming invocations of death, a subject of many local folktales, and their life-giving waters, which combine to form the Duero. On the other hand, Moncayo looms as a distant, inaccessible massif with one very broad peak. This summit is the unbowed senti- nel guarding the gateway between Aragon and Castile. Moncayo is the quintessence of a natural phenomenon lending itself to the process of artistic creation as defined by Giner de los Ríos. The smooth, long symmetry of the peak is in accord with classical ideals of beauty; the massif lies between Castile and Aragon, the two king- doms whose union launched modern Spain; and the seemingly</page><page sequence="12">54 ISLE immutable earthen mass is usually veiled or latticed by rapidly pass- ing clouds. The blue diaphanous sky usually over the city of Soria and the páramo permitted Machado to take in with a glance the en- tire landscape between the city and Moncayo. He repeatedly could refine the view in his bodily eye before drawing the images into himself. Although the poems in Campos de Castilla may be uneven in qual- ity, not one is properly labeled as a specimen of local or regional po- etry. These poems go far beyond being idylls of country estates or mere idiographic descriptions of a region, because the focus usually shifts from the external stimuli to Machado's inner and deepest feel- ings, feelings that the reader shares if he or she understands the signification of the Sorian landscapes. In a 1938 interview, Machado said, "Soy hombre extraordinariamente sensible al lugar en que vivo. La geografía, las tradiciones, las costumbres de las poblaciones por donde paso, me impresionan profundamente y dejan huella en mi espíritu" (I am a man extraordinarily sensitive to the place in which I live. The geography, the traditions, the customs of the places I pass through, impress me profoundly and leave their mark on my spirit) (Molinero 213). Machado's poetry on the Sorian landscapes is partic- ularly appealing because of his portrayal of the land's spiritual vital- ity as a counterpoint to its outward poverty. The plain landscape unveils the depth of Spain's historical decline. In referring to the symbols and relics of Castile's combative past, Machado digests the detritus of Spain's imperial age, breaking it down to found a new Spain in step with Soria's honest simplicity and real spirituality. Poem CXIII, "Campos de Soria," is the premier example of this process. Section VII reads: ¡Colinas plateadas, grises alcores, cárdenas roquedas por donde traza el duero su curva de ballesta en torno a Soria, . . . tardes de Soria, mística y guerrera, hoy siento por vosotros, en el fondo del corazón, tristeza, tristeza que es amor! ¡Campos de Soria donde parece que las rocas sueñan, conmigo vais! (172)</page><page sequence="13">Sorian Landscapes in Campos de Castilla 55 Silver hills, gray heights, thistle-colored rocky slopes through which the Duero traces its crossbow curve round Soria, . . . evenings in Soria, mystical and warlike, today I feel for you, in the depth of my heart, sadness, a sadness that is love! Fields of Soria where the rocks appear to dream, you go with me! The timeworn Sorian landscapes evoke a sadness that is love be- cause their material poverty represents a want that can be met with human love and implies a rich spirituality that can nurture the hu- man soul. The poem ends with two verses proclaiming the poet's hope for a new Spain: "que el sol de España os llene / de alegría, de luz y de riqueza!" (may the Spanish sun fill you / with joy, with light, with abundance!) (173). Like many places in interior Spain, Soria has pretentious monu- ments constructed in baroque or even rococo style, but they are few and dispersed, and they do not figure in Machado's poetry. Gerardo Diego Cendoya, a poet and professor of literature who assumed a cátedra in 1920 at the same Sorian institute where Machado had taught, wrote that the city of Soria had "rooftops capricious and child-like, as if made at random and from memory by the hands of arbitrary mason-poets" (López del Amo 26). The same plain archi- tectural style prevails outside the provincial capital. The ruins of Numantia, just to the northeast of the city, contain relics marking the simple constructions of the Celtiberians and the modest recon- structions by their conquerors, the Romans. Soria also has some of the largest and least-ornamented castles and plazas (fortified settle- ments) in Spain. Machado loved the stark structures and architec- tural remnants dotting the rises. These landmarks have a mystical and warlike quality that is redolent of a younger, more virile, more telluric, and purer Spain. All combine to form an atmospheric mi- lieu uncontaminated, at least in Machado's judgment, by the oppres- sive social forces and reactionary political figures that had sapped Spain since the apogee of its world power in the sixteenth century.</page><page sequence="14">56 ISLE Machado was not antipathetic to modernization; rather, he believed that Spain had to look far back into its past so that the right values could be readopted, values that would guide Spain in its move to catch up with Western European democracy, social justice, and eco- nomic growth. Soria was Machado's patria because it was like a hall of mirrors reflecting images that brought to mind, either through con- scious invention, recollection, or dreams, a Spain that was simple, plain, and modest and a Spain in which the imagination and spirit soared. The aura of death surrounding the poverty, barrenness, and decay of the Sorian landscapes is also a source of spirituality. The daily confrontation with death's specter was particularly meaningful for Machado. Although Machado on a number of occasions struggled to believe in the Christian concept of God, he remained an agnostic throughout his life. For Machado, death meant the ultimate extinc- tion of self. Various poems in Soledades , galerías y otros poemas (espe- cially LXXVIII and LXXIX) indicate that Machado wrestled with ex- istential concerns before he lived in Soria. However, once in Soria, Machado found a wealth of morbid landscape elements that aided him in the expression of those concerns. In Soria, his concerns with death did not have to turn inward into the labyrinths of his mind and soul nor depend on oneiric landscape images. In Soria, Ma- chado quickly linked his concerns with death and extinction to the look of the landscape. He created a core vocabulary, what he called "unas pocas palabras verdaderas" (a few true words), often adjoin- ing nouns and adjectives or prepositional phrases to form new lexi- cal combinations. Many of these combinations evoke death. Here are some examples from poem XCVIII, "A orillas del Duero" in Campos de Castilla : a rounded, elongate hill like a recamado escudo (overlaid shield), the Duero forming a corva ballesta (crossbow bend), a noble and sad land of decrépitas ciudades (decrepit cities), Soria as a morte- cino hogar (fading hearth), sangre derramada (spilled blood) when Castile had "the fever of the sword," enlutadas viejas (old women in mourning) going to prayers, the inn open to the campo ensombrecido (darkened countryside) and to the pedregal desierto (deserted stony ground). Machado's existential preoccupations became more acute when death cut Leonor's life short. A despondent Machado considered shooting himself, but the acclamation accorded Campos de Castilla , published a little more than a month before her death, stayed his</page><page sequence="15">Sorian Landscapes in Campos de Castilla 57 hand, if it did not end his grief. After moving to Baeza, Machado be- came so dispirited that his mother left Madrid to be by his side, and she remained with him until he died on Ash Wednesday, February 22, 1939, in Collioure, France (Cobb 29; Pérez Ferrero 170).5 Antonio and Leonor, despite marked differences in age and background, had en- joyed a compenetration and harmony rarely achieved in matrimony (Gonzalez 30-31). Leonor was never mentioned in Machado's po- etry until after her death; however, according to Macri, she was as- similated in the Sorian myth and was indirectly alluded to in the young virgins, mothers, and natural phenomena such as the Duero River and a budding, half-dead elm tree, all of which Machado used to symbolize the continuity of life in the austere Spanish hearth called Castile (151). The memory of the deceased Leonor kept the mind's eye of the poet focused on the Sorian landscape and its role in the drama of life and death. In "Los sueños dialogados" (Dreams in Dialogue) section of poem CLXIV, "Glosando a Ronsard y otras ri- mas" (Glossing Ronsard and Other Poems), written probably in 1919, Machado questioned why his heart yearned for the barren lands of Castile and answered: Mi corazón está donde ha nacido, no a la vida, al amor, cerca del Duero . . . ¡El muro blanco y el ciprés erguido! (321) My heart is where it was born, not to life, to love, near the Duero . . . The whitewashed wall and the erect slender cypress! The last line harks back to El Espino, the cemetery, on a hill behind Nuestra Señora del Espino, where Leonor lay. The poem CXVIII, "Caminos," written in Baeza in November 1913, is a lyric descrip- tion of the Sorian countryside until the last line, when Machado for the first time poetically acknowledges Leonor's death: "¡Ay, ya, no puedo caminar con ella!" (Ay! no longer can I walk with her!). The poem CXXII, also written in 1913, is a dreamy ballad memorializing Leonor. In it Machado dreams that on a calm morning Leonor led him along a white path amid verdant fields toward blue mountain peaks. This poem makes explicit the relationship between the youth- ful Leonor and vital landscape elements in Soria, and at the end Machado tentatively expressed the hope that one's soul is immortal:</page><page sequence="16">58 ISLE "Vive, esperanza, ¡quién sabe / lo que se traga la tierra!" (Live on, hope, who knows / what the earth swallows up!). That hope, rooted in a dream, is implicitly denied by the imminent awakening. Despite efforts to the contrary after Leonor 's death, Machado never could re- place his agnosticism with faith. Yet the soul-searching struggle for faith infused his lyrics on the Sorian landscapes with a refined pathos that elicits the reader's tenderest sympathy. Before an analysis of a few of nature's elements in the Sorian landscapes of Campos de Castilla , we need some sense of how he ob- served and treated space and spatial relationships. As space is ap- prehended at different scales, let us consider Lutwack's hierarchy of places by areal extent: earth, continents, regions, landscapes, dwell- ings, dwelling interiors, things within touch, and places too small for human occupancy except in the imagination (38). Though it is not so stated by Lutwack, this hierarchy is nested. Thus, a landscape, for example, includes every place below it in the hierarchy and within its areal extent. Machado's structuring of poems is quite versatile ge- ographically. In the poems in Campos de Castilla , Machado typically employs logical forms of space just long enough to create a real place in real time. But he knew that to dwell on such a logically arranged space too long would draw the reader's attention from the landscape to the author's location, and that, in the end, only his lone shadow would be projected onto the scene. Machado would surely have been sympathetic to, perhaps even in total agreement with, Rainer Maria Rilke's "World Inner Space," in which a single space spreads and "Die Vögel fliegen still / durch uns hindurch" (the birds silently fly / right through us) (Burnshaw xliii). Perhaps the more external focus of Machado's poetry beginning around 1906 was a response to a need created by the spatialization of his dreams: Machado needed to fill his interior spaces with scenes to guide his passage (Molinero 236-37). That Machado could maintain logical spatial perspectives through- out a poem while gradually and deftly internalizing the landscape is proven beyond doubt in poem CXXVI, "A José María Palacio." As we have seen, this epistolary poem begins with Machado asking Palacio if spring is yet dressing the poplars along the Duero and the roads. The reader quickly envisions a city and a river with charming poplar-lined promenades along both riverbanks. Then Machado, by mention of the páramo , gently broadens the reader's vision to the en-</page><page sequence="17">Sorian Landscapes in Campos de Castilla 59 tire basin of the upper Duero. Machado next refocuses the reader's attention on the city when he asks if the old elms have new leaves; in fact, this hints at the half-dead elm tree near Leonor's grave behind Nuestra Señora del Espino. Then Machado hails Moncayo and its red and white beauty in the sky of Aragon. At this juncture of the poem, the boundaries and focal line of the landscape are established, and the reader can infer that the poet is recollecting the vistas from El Castillo, a hill on the eastern end of the city. Machado then human- izes the landscape by detailing it with the sights and activities com- mon to the Sorian spring: stork nests on bell towers, green wheat fields, sowing of late crops before the April rains, and hunting. After that, he poeticizes phenomena that are smaller and more fleetingly parts of this Sorian landscape: bees, plum tree blossoms, violets, and nightingales. The song of the male nightingale (Luscinia megarhyn- chos), for example, can be heard only for a few weeks after his return from winter quarters. In the poem's conclusion, Machado tells his friend, Palacio, to climb to (the cemetery of) El Espino to put irises and roses on Leonor's grave, the spiritual and real physical focus of the poem. Throughout this wistful poem Machado maintained a re- strained and dignified manner; at the end it is the reader who, re- sponsive to life's fragile and brief hold on this world, hears an inner voice, perhaps Machado's, crying "ay!" Machado's treatment of the landscape is seldom as ordered as in this poem, in which the elements are arranged hierarchically and spatially around a geographic focal point. Instead, he was usually tuned to a sensuous world with animate objects, anthropomorphic plants and animals, and people caught up in Manichaean struggles. Machado described this world from many perspectives, some am- biguous and complex and others aperçus. What makes Machado's poetry so profoundly moving is not his "few true words," his prosodies, or other technical traits, but his verbalization of what Ed- mund Husserl, the German philosopher and founder of phenome- nology, called the Lebenswelt (life-world), a world of experience that is unrestricted by any logical idealization and that forms the sub- strate for all cognition (41-46). In Machado's Lebenswelt , space is not a Euclidean abstraction but is conceived as an incredibly rich tapes- try: as material substance; as telluric depth, thickness, durability, or fragility; as aquatic space, including the absence of water; as air space with sounds, smells, and hues; and as constructed space with</page><page sequence="18">60 ISLE surfaces, forms, and colors. His gift for describing all these spaces is displayed in these few lyric verses from poem CIII, "Las Encinas" (The Holm Oaks): los chopos son la ribera, liras de primavera, cerca del agua que fluye, pasa y huye, viva o lenta, que se emboca turbulenta o en remanso se dilata. En su eterno escalofrío copian del agua del río las vivas ondas de plata. The poplars are the riverbank, lyres of spring, close to the water that flows, passes and flees, quick or slow, that narrows turbulently or spreads slowly in pools. In their never-ending trembling they follow the river's water the lively silvery waves. Although Machado dedicated this poem to the memory of an excur- sion to El Pardo, a historic town just north of Madrid in a country- side irrigated by the Manzanares River, the imagery above springs from Soria and the Duero. The material substances are the poplars, the riverbank, and the river. The poplars take on telluric depth with the first verse above. Aquatic space is represented with flowing water, the source of life, but also symbolic of life's passage, which is usually swift though sometimes slow. Air space is reckoned in the "lyres of spring" and the trembling leaves. Constructed space is the poplars or European aspens ( Populus tremula ), which in Soria are planted along the Duero and its nearby promenades. They are planted there primarily because they grow rapidly, spreading roots</page><page sequence="19">Sorian Landscapes in Campos de Castilla 6i and suckers that hold the banks fast. But these trees transcend the utilitarian. Their trembling leaves surround the riparian promenades with sound and momentarily chart the wafts of air. These riverine poplars assume many of the significations of the natural elements with which they are intertwined. Distance is one characteristic by which all the spaces of the Lebens- welt can be compared. Though seldom mentioned explicitly by Machado, distance is critical to his poetics. Whereas in the voguish language of Cartesian rationalism distance is measured by the fric- tion that must be overcome at some cost, in Machadian philosophy distance is simply physical absence that can be negated by the long- ings of the soul. In fact, to Machado distance is beneficial because the soul has to flee to bring forth songs. The poet eloquently re- phrased these ideas in poem CXXXVI, "Proverbios y cantares" (Prov- erbs and Songs), where he observed that there are two modes of consciousness, luz (light: as a physical agent and intellectual illumi- nation) and paciencia (patience, forbearance). The former rests on lighting a small part of the deep sea to glimpse live but fleeting fish, while the latter waits like a fisherman in hopes of catching fish only to throw them, dying, onto the sand (241). In other words, whereas the scientist scrutinizes part of the world in pursuit of findings to add to a body of knowledge, the poet intuits the world by unreining the senses to probe life's elusive mysteries. Science - in the broad sense of systematic knowledge concerned with phenomena, laws, causes and effects - is what Arthur Schopenhauer, the German phil- osopher and founder of phenomenology, called a mass of represen- tations or mere forms and what Machado, via the imaginary alter ego Juan de Mairena, glossed as "nuevas apariciones de ser" (new appearances of being) (Schopenhauer 27-31; Machado 364). Art re- lies on pure contemplation to search the core of reality and, accord- ing to Abel Martin - Machado's other alter ego - accepts nothing- ness as well as existence and darkness as well as light (Machado 365). Lyric poems such as Machado's also communicate the com- munal pleasures associated with the incantations of ancient poet- singers and, through their melodies, provide an immediate objecti- fication of the world. Distance brings forth songs, but Machado's lyricism closes distance by spinning a thread of passion and feeling that eventually unites human wills into a spaceless whole. Machado selected a number of landscape elements to symbolize distance and horizon: hazy mountains, dawn and dusk, flying birds,</page><page sequence="20">62 ISLE rivers flowing to the sea, and roads stretching away. According to Orozco Díaz, the road, a reflection of the human experience, is the most repeated symbol in all of Machado's poetry (181).6 To Machado, the road was a vision that could be followed, but a hori- zon would always be ahead until death ruled otherwise. Moreover, as we proceed along our roads, the distance from every place we have been increases inexorably. Realizing that the sum of the dis- tances around us never decreases, Machado was undaunted by any one distance and the physical separation it represented. Whichever perception of distance - the Cartesian or the poetic - is ultimately to be preferred, distance is time. As the wayfarer journeys through space, he or she draws nearer to death but also intensifies the emo- tional experience of still being alive. Accepting the inevitability of distance and understanding that distance and longing are powerful correlates, Machado continued to describe Soria in his poems writ- ten after 1912 but resisted a return visit until 1932, when he reluc- tantly consented to accept the civic title of adoptive son of Soria. In his acceptance speech of 1932, Machado dutifully praised Soria as a city of poets. However, this poet had an ambiguous attitude to- ward all cities, large or small. He used them as a source of employ- ment, as outlets for publication, as places to seek tertulias (get-to- gethers of cliques in cafés, clubs, and so on), and, from 1928 to 1935, as places for trysts with "Guiomar" (Pilar de Valderrama, a modest poet and married woman from Madrid). Machado would have approved of Azorin's statement on the Generation of 98 that "visi- tábamos las vetustas ciudades en el tiempo y el espacio, visitábamos las ciudades castellanas, descubríamos y corroborábamos en estas ciudades la continuidad nacional" (we visited the ancient cities in time and space, we went to observe the Castilian cities, we discov- ered and confirmed in these cities the continuity of this nation) (Se- rrano Poncela 31). According to Albornoz, plazas, streets, and bal- conies are the most frequent unreal, imaginary landscape images of Juan de Mairena and Abel Martin, the two apocryphal professors created by Machado (171). In one of his philosophical works, De lo uno a lo otro (From One to the Other), Abel Martin defined love as "la autorrevelación de la esencial heterogeneidad de la sustancia única" (the self-revelation of the essential heterogeneity of a unique sub- stance) (Machado 334). Machado reasoned that the heterogeneity of all being meant, in the end, that all had to be one and the same - the sole universal monad; nevertheless, like a number of other poets of</page><page sequence="21">Sorian Landscapes in Campos de Castilla 63 the early twentieth century, he often decried cities as ugly and im- moral. What Machado thought of provincial cities is embodied in these words of Abel Martin: La vida en provincias es una copia descolorida de la vida ma- drileña; es esta misma vida vista en uno de esos espejos de café provinciano, enturbiados por muchas generaciones de moscas. Con un estropajo y un poco de lejía . . . estamos en la Puerta del Sol. (Molinero 197-98) 7 Life in the provinces is a faded copy of Madrilenean life; this same life is seen in one of those provincial café mirrors that is clouded with flies. With a sponge and a little lye . . . we are in the Puerta del Sol. The poet was also critical of Madrid. In the early 1920s, Machado wrote letters to Gerardo Diego and to Unamuno in which he re- ferred to Madrilenean life as beocia (Boeotian: stupid and philistine). The hectic pace, monotonous routines, and flimflams of urban life ratcheted Machado's existential anxiety more tightly around his soul. Poem CVI, "Un loco" (A Madman) portrays a "wise" madman fleeing the Castilian city through a ruined countryside: Huye de la ciudad . . . Pobres maldades, misérrimas virtudes y quehaceres de chulos aburridos, y ruindades de ociosos mercaderes. (163) He flees from the city . . . Unfortunate evils, miserable virtues, goings-on of bored hucksters, and despicable tricks of lazy idle merchants. The lunatic is the scapegoat who purges the city of its sin. Machado was not merely reacting to industrial urbanism, which was scant in Spain at the time; he was also condemning the denizens of the prein- dustrial Spanish city for not shepherding the land's resources. This accusation has ample justification in most of central and southern Spain, where the evident desolation is a result of centuries of un- regulated mining excavations and spoils, of widespread deforesta- tion - especially of the holm oak ( Quercus ilex), and of overgrazing of pastures and farmlands alike. For example, the Mesta, a guild of</page><page sequence="22">6ą isle sheep raisers, inadvertently brought about the denudation of much of rural Spain. The administrative and judicial oversight of the guild's activities was located in the cities, and the wealthiest and most powerful sheep raisers resided there as well. The city of Soria was the head of one of the cuadrillas or four districts of the Mesta. Machado's favorite, oft-repeated word pair for cities is ciudades de- crépitas , which succinctly reflects his belief that the Castilian city was wasted with age and culturally exhausted. The perception of these cities nearing death is based on the rapidity of time measured in hu- man pulses and observed up close. Machado saw the crumbling sur- faces within palm's length, heard the caterwauling just beyond the glassed-in balcony where he often composed poems, and felt to the bone the enveloping decay. Except for the sea, the city is closer to death allegorically than any other place discussed in his poetry. The poet's most lyrical and justly acclaimed verses on the city are in Sec- tion VI of poem CXIII, "Campos de Soria." ¡Soria fría, Soria pura , cabeza de Extremadura , con su castillo guerrero arruinado, sobre el Duero; con sus murallas roídas y sus casas denegridas! ¡Muerta ciudad de señores soldados o cazadores; de portales con escudos de cien linajes hidalgos, y de famélicos galgos, de galgos flacos y agudos, que pululan por las sórdidas callejas, y a la medianoche ululan, cuando graznan las cornejas! ¡Soria fría! La campana de la Audiencia da la una. Soria, ciudad castellana ¡tan bella! bajo la luna. Cold Soria, pure Soria, head of Extremadura,</page><page sequence="23">Sorian Landscapes in Campos de Castilla 65 with your warlike castle in ruins, above the Duero; with your crumbling walls and your blackened houses! Dead city of landed lords given to soldiering or the hunt; with escutcheoned portals of a hundred distinguished lines, and of famished greyhounds, of pinched and tense greyhounds, that swarm in the squalid alleys, and howl at midnight, when the black crows caw! Cold Soria! The courthouse bell strikes one. Soria, Castilian city - so beautiful! - beneath the moon. Most of "Campos de Soria" is written in the Italianate silva with its hendecasyllabic and heptasyllabic lines irregularly combined, but Section VI is in ballad (octosyllabic) meter, except for the hemi- stichal line 13. The metrical abbreviation speeds our recitation and heightens our perception of the passage of time. The first stanza is a panoramic image of a Castilian city, in real space and time, that has passed from youthful vigor to decrepitude. The first four verses permit anyone familiar with the geography of the old fortified settlements of Castile to locate the city below the ruined castle and along the Duero. The first two lines (minus the words Soria fría) are the city's motto; they beckon us back to the early stages of the reconquest when Soria was at the fore of the Christian advance against the Moors. The irony in the phrase Soria pura was not lost on Machado. The purity referred to was a supposed racial purity, which in Spain historically meant having no ancestors who were Moors, Jews, heretics, or victims of the Inquisition. However, when Alfonso I ordered the repopulation of the city of Soria in the twelfth century, people came from many parts. There were so many Jews that they extended their settlement from the aljama (Jewish quarter) on the grounds of the old castle, at the eastern end of the city, to the central Plaza Mayor and even to the urban skirts. The</page><page sequence="24">66 ISLE final three lines of this stanza leave the imagination fixed on the city but abruptly shift the reader's attention from the mystified past to the squalid present. Although Machado's finely presented panorama might be likened to a canvas of Aureliano de Beruete, the impressionist painter of Castilian scenes, or to a description of an old Castilian city in one of Azorin's essays, the second stanza is a brilliantly wrought scene. Here, the reader's senses are riveted on the street, the public focal line of urban life in Spalņ. Again, Machado beckons us back in time with the first four verses. The lords were hijosdalgos or, in the syn- cope preferred nowadays^, hidalgos , men without noble titles who nevertheless enjoyed the many honorific and lucrative privileges of nobility in return for their readiness to defend the Crown with arms and horses. Their escutcheons, now usually in considerable disre- pair, still jut out above many Sorian doorways. In the remaining lines of the second stanza, Machado uses animals well known in the folk- lore of Spain to bridge the past and the present. Machado reduces the greyhounds, typically depicted by Velazquez and other artists as well-groomed coursers of foxes and hares, to curs running wildly in packs and howling futilely at the death heralded by the black crows.8 The howling of the dogs symbolizes the existential anguish of the human soul confronted with nothingness. The final stanza begins with the same evocation, Soria fría, as if to reintroduce the same panoramic image of the city. Instead, Machado interposed the courthouse clock with its bell gonging on the hour. No concept in his poetry is more complex than that of time, because he tried to understand it dialectically. Most likely, Machado experi- enced exaltation at the end of this poem because, as in poem XXI, the silence after the gong assured him that he would not see the last drop of the clepsydra fall. Why should he fear what is beyond his consciousness? So, he exults as the gleaming moon, a symbol of tri- umphant death, casts its ghostly light over the city's deadly forms. The enduring bond that Machado formed with Soria is a testa- ment to the spiritual and sensual sustenance available in even the most barren and ruined landscapes. Although in Campos de Castilla Machado appeared to redirect his contemplation outward and away from self, he remained, as ever, a keen student of his own sensibili- ties. In Soria, he sensed for the first time a fusion of souls, his and Leonor's, nature's, and the collective soul of the patria. Machado's</page><page sequence="25">Sorian Landscapes in Campos de Castilla 67 tellurian sensitivity was an outgrowth of his love for the Sorian lands and peoples. His sardonic commentary and denunciatory po- ems on cities reflected his conviction that urbanités and their insti- tutions had sanctioned the wasting of the land he loved. By focusing on the spirituality of Soria, Machado revealed the beauty that can be found beneath stark surfaces and in distant horizons by the mind's eye. In his mental travels through time and space, he wove the thread that tied the natural elements and human activities of Soria into one hauntingly beautiful landscape. Machado, like others in the Genera- tion of 98, did not have most of the practical answers to Spain's so- cial, political, and economic problems, but Campos de Castilla was a substantial contribution to the corpus of generational literature on Castile, a corpus that lured official Spain's attention away from colo- nial adventurism and toward itself. He reintroduced his country- men to an invigorating Lebenswelt that was right at home - along ur- ban walkways, in river valleys, and where the land and sky marry. Machado counseled his countrymen to show real patriotism, not by warring over territory, but by battling to advance the culture and to restore the land. Although in Campos de Castilla Machado wrote about real places in real time, many of its lyrics clarion strongly in modern Spain. The Spain of today comes closer to Machado's ideals, yet how his writ- ings, popular again among his compatriots, contributed to this trans- formation has not been answered definitively. But Machado showed that landscapes can be an inexhaustible provision for others who make bold to embark on regenerating the cultures of their places and times. We can use Machado's thread of artistic creation to weave ourselves into what Murphy (102) calls the "interpenetrating jew- elled net of the world" and to sustain a dialogue with the rest of na- ture. The primary signification of the Sorian landscapes is that even a plain, simple, modest landscape can be invoked to contribute to the spiritual sustenance of the individual and to the preservation and reshaping of our national identity and purpose.

Also I am indebted to</page><page sequence="26">68 ISLE Dr. Rafael EspejoSaavedra, Department of Foreign Languages and Litera- tures at UMKC, Dr. Daniel Hopkins, Department of Geosciences at UMKC, and the editor. They read and offered invaluable comments on an earlier draft of this paper. Finally, I am grateful to UMKC and to the University As- sociates for providing financial support in 1993 for a summer trip to Spain, which included an excursion to Soria. 2. Ángel Revilla has written that Segovia, where Machado lived for twelve years, did not add a single lyric note to his poetry. Lafuente Ferrari has shown that Machado made passing references to just a few elements of the Segovian landscape. See Lafuente Ferrari 73. 3. To fully appreciate the disinterested patriotism of Machado, one must imagine the vengeful feelings this centenary awakened. The last war on So- rian soil was the War of Independence, in which Soria was invaded by French forces in 1808 and remained occupied until 1812. The population of the city was 3,800 in 1800 and reportedly declined to a low of 700 during the occupation. See Carpintero 69 and López del Amo 3. The atrocities commit- ted by the very large French army have been recorded with all the lurid de- tails in Francisco Goya's "Los desastres de la guerra" (The Disasters of the War), drawings and etchings executed from 1808 to 1820. Lest there be any doubt about the authenticity of the scenes, Goya wrote in the margins of many of the drawings, "I saw this." See Goya. 4. Pierre de Ronsard (1524-1385) was a great poet of nature, rivers, forest, and fountains. He renewed the octosyllabic and decasyllabic lines, and he reinvigorated the Alexandrine. 5. Machado always preferred Spain to anywhere else. He spent some twenty months abroad in Paris on three occasions (1899, 1902, and 1911). In an interview in 1937, shortly before waning Republican fortunes in the Spanish Civil War forced him to flee to France, he said, "Cuando pienso en un posible destierro, en una tierra que no sea esta atormentada tierra española, mi corazón se llena de pesadumbre. Tengo la certeza de que el extranjero significaría para mí la muerte" (When I think of a possible exile, in a land that is not this tormented Spanish land, my heart fills with grief. I am certain that living abroad would mean death for me). See Pla y Bel- tran 46. 6. For a complete discussion of the image of the road, see Zardoya, espe- cially 102-34. 7. The Puerta del Sol (Gate of the Sun) is a large and bustling square that is the hub of Madrid. 8. In European folklore the crow has an ambivalent character, sometimes good and other times bad. In Cantar de mio Cid (Poem of the Cid) a crow flying to one's right is good luck and to one's left is bad luck. In Soria, the black crows are most likely carrion crows ( Corvus corone), which have a strong</page><page sequence="27">Sorian Landscapes in Campos de Castilla 69 association with death because they sometimes kill weak lambs and are of- ten found feeding on the carcasses of lambs killed by other predators.
