It suggests that while the the- matic approach to Moche iconography is useful, application of an approach that assumes that the themes are segments of a narrative will increase our understanding of the myths behind Moche art. After discussing the basis on which narrative may be inferred from art, the narrative approach is applied to demonstrate how known Moche artistic themes may be placed in sequence. Some previous uncertainties regarding iconographicfigures are resolved, and part of the Moche mythic corpus is presented.

Copyright C) by the Society for American Archaeology [N]arrative is international, transhistorical, transcultural: it is simply there, like life itself. Roland Barthes (1977:79) r nhis essay presents an argument for analyz- ing Moche art from the perspective of nar- _ - rative. It provides a theoretical basis for this approach and application of it to a series of Moche artworks, some of which I previously have discussed (Quilter 1990). The narrative approach is an extension of the thematic approach devel- oped by Christopher Donnan (1975, 1976). It is, in a sense, an attempt to progress from still pho- tography to motion pictures, to move from isolat- ing characters and the scenes in which they appear to viewing the characters as actors in a story that can be seen mostly in segments and, rarely, in longer "clips" of film. Instead of pieces of motion picture film, however, we have scenes mostly depicted on pottery. We lack the certainty that we have a single film. We may be faced with segments of one or more stories. The segments are of varying length, and the characters shown in them differ in their styles of portrayal and actions depicted. But with careful study, these fragments of ancient narrative can be pieced together to retrieve the myths that this art illustrated. The art style in question is that of the Moche of the north coast of Peru a culture, initially rec- ognizable in the first century A.D., which lasted for about 600 years. Details on this culture and its representational art form can be found in a great number of published works (Alva 1994; Alva and Donnan 1993; Benson 1972; Donnan 1978; Larco Hoyle 1938; Uceda and Mujica 1994). The paint- ings discussed here primarily date to the last two phases of a five-phase ceramic sequence, when pottery vessels were painted with the most elabo- rate scenes found in the Moche corpus and when similar art in other media, such as wall murals, likely were created. The Thematic Approach The thematic approach was developed by Christopher Donnan and employed by him and his colleagues (e.g., Cordy-Collins 1977; McClelland 1990) as a means to find keys to the 113 THE NARRATIVE APPROACH TO MOCHE ICONOGRAPHY Jeffrey Quilter</page><page sequence="2">114 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 8, No. 2, 1997 Naturally, there is insufElcient evidence to conclude that the Elgure we are seeing in these three represen- tations is Mollep, or that the figure lived at Coslechec. Yet it does seem reasonable that the Elgure depicted in Moche art is somehow related to the one described in the historical record [Donnan 1976:84]. He immediately follows this caution, however, by suggesting that many customs, beliefs, and religious practices remained largely unchanged for 1,300 years on the north coast of Peru. This assumption of strong cultural continuities also has served as the basis for using information gathered ethnographically from modern shaman- istic practices to interpret Moche art (Sharon 1978; Sharon and Donnan 1974). Even specific beliefs, such as the present-day value of the cura- tive powers of a sea lion's gastric stones, are thought to be survivors of Moche culture (Donnan 1978:136; see Benson 1983:75). Scholars who follow the thematic approach thus recognize con- tinuities and links between prehistoric art and eth- nohistoric and ethnographic data, but they generally refuse to link these observations with their studies of iconography, or they link them in limited, highly specific ways. The thematic approach has yielded insights into Moche art and ideology with sound, rigorous scholarship and compelling arguments. Ongoing studies continue to reveal important lessons in the nature of Moche religion and ideology. Limitations and problems in the thematic approach, however, are inherent. Problem of Theme Proliferation No criteria have been established as to what con- stitutes a theme. Therefore, any image or group of figures found more than once on a Moche pot can be dubbed a theme. Although only a handful of themes heretofore have been named and dis- cussed, proliferation of identified themes with no (narrative) linkages between them may result in a static collection of separate entities with little explanatory power. Related to this is a dilemma: once certain themes are identified, future studies may be biased toward those or similar themes and ignore divergent scenes. A kind of "normal iconography," similar to the "normal science" described by Thomas Kuhn (1970), dominates research, pushing alternative approaches and interpretations into the background. symbol system of Moche art. The model for this approach is language. "Rules of expression" (Donnan 1976:5-6) can be deduced by finding patterns in art: Specific individuals can be identiEled by noting the consistent combination of features associated with them their physical form, distinctive clothing, and objects being held-in the same way that Santa Claus can be distinguished from all other figures in Western art . . . the meaning of a specific Elgure can be deter- mined . . . by noting the range of activities in which he is engaged, and the consistent setting in which he is represented [Donnan 1976:8]. The analytical focus of the thematic approach is on recurring groups of figures and variants of them that are referred to as "themes." This approach was ground breaking in the systematic way it approached Moche art. It resulted in the identification of a number of themes, demon- strated that these themes often were expressed by a single symbolic element alone, and argued that all Moche art expresses nonsecular ideas. In its goal of systematic rigor, the thematic approach follows a number of conventions that are conservative in nature. It generally avoids labeling figures with the names of gods or deities, preferring reference through use of a lettering system, although some other scholars give partic- ular individuals titles such as the Goddess (a.k.a. the Woman), the Rayed Deity, and the Owl (Berezkin 1980; Hocquenghem and Lyon 1980). The riches of the historical record and oral tra- ditions are used to enhance interpretations, but scholars of the thematic approach school seem ambivalent in making direct links between text, traditions, and ancient art. For example, the writ- ings of the seventeenth-century chronicler Calancha are discussed by Donnan (1976:83-85) regarding a sorcerer named Mollep (the Lousy), a resident of Coslechec, who stated that as the lice multiplied on his body so would the people of the region. Three bottles that have the essential fea- tures of Mollep are known. Two bottles are fig- urines of seated human forms with insectlike creatures resembling lice modeled on their bod- ies. The third bottle is a similar figurine with small humans modeled in the same locations where lice are shown on the others. In terms of how these bottles should be interpreted, Donnan says:</page><page sequence="3">Quilter] NARRATIVE APPROACH TO MOCHE ICONOGRAPHY 115 By emphasizing themes, a quantitative bias enters analysis that fails to take into account the complexities involved in cultural dynamics that maintain, transmit, and transform ideology. By counting the number of appearances of boats and oceanic figures on Moche pottery (Tule Boat Theme), McClelland (1990:84) concludes that there was a "maritime shift in Moche mythology." The significance of more frequent depictions of oceanic subjects in later phases is explained as a modification of the Moche's mythical world due to widespread flooding resulting from an El Nino disaster (McClelland 1990:92). This may be true, but intriguing questions are left unanswered. One may ask what the nature of such "modifications" were. Was it a shift in emphasis that gave greater weight to what were previously minor elements in the Moche mythic corpus? Was it the creation of new stories to make sense of new circumstances? Was it a process that incorporated the beliefs of other non-Moche peoples into a new form? In addition, there are larger issues as to how ideology interacts with other realms of human experience. Perhaps a simple, direct causal rela- tionship exists between an increase in the fre- quency of the Tule Boat Theme and the Moche's economic fortunes, as McClelland (1990:92) sug- gests. Devastating rains may have diminished the role of agriculture and increased the consumption of Elsh. Consequent expansion of long-distance trade may be reflected in the shift from represen- tations of small Elshing boats to the depiction of large trading craft. Such direct linkages can be seen in the changing iconography of Christmas. The gift-giving roles of the Three Kings and of Saint Nicholas (a minor and peripheral character not associated with the original nativity story) have been emphasized, while the Massacre of the Innocents has been de-emphasized through time. But religious beliefs cannot always be explained through materialist theory (Bawden 1995). The ways in which symbols mutate in times of social or economic crises are not always simple and clear-cut. In their discussion of the Burial Theme, Donnan and McClelland (1979: 11-13) strongly support cultural continuity from Moche times through the early period of European rule, noting particularly the writings of Fr. Antonio de la Calancha regarding native beliefs and practices. While they entertain the possibility that their examples of the Burial Theme may depict a gen- eral practice, they favor an explanation that the scenes represent the burial of a specific historical individual. Their opinion is based on the fact that the depictions of the burial and ceremonies sur- rounding it are so similar to one another. They decline to make a final decision, however, since there are oral traditions for totally fictitious per- sonages, while the stories of real people often become mythologized. The issue of whether or not Moche art depicts historical events is not simply one of fiction vs. history. Religious ideas do respond to specific events in the lives of believers, but those lives are also reinterpreted and, sometimes, actually lived to conform to ideas that people hold dear or important. Recent research on the timing of Mesoamerican warfare in relation to astronomical events is but one example of such behavior (Carlson 1991, 1993). To link a theme with his- torical events may or may not be appropriate, depending on the case in question. But the histor- ical event itself is likely only one dimension of a multidimensional cultural process that is involved in the interactions between what we separately label history, culture, ideology, and art. It is not that these scenes represent ritual or myth or his- tory (Benson 1983:73), since such distinctions do not necessarily exist in as clear-cut a manner as we might like to think, even in our own society.l Given that Moche art was made through the course of several centuries, over a wide geo- graphical area, and by many hands, it is likely that there is great variation in its purpose and content. Narrowing the scope of analysis to the final two phases of Moche art increases the chance of iden- tifying narrative because fine line painting was more common in these periods. Such a represen- tational style opened up the opportunity to put more information into a limited space, such as on a ceramic vessel, whereas earlier, broader styles produced more iconic, static images with only one or a few figures. Still, the temporal depth, geographical breadth, and artistic variations even of the last two phases of Moche art make it likely that some of the representations may refer to aspects of culture not directly connected to narra-</page><page sequence="4">116 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 8, No. 2, 1997 tive. The well-known ceramic portrait heads may be representations of particular individuals and not directly associated with narrative, for exam- ple. But many of the themes identiEled by Donnan and his colleagues can be demonstrated to be linked to one another as part of a narrative that best can be described as mythological. The Narrative Approach Narrative is here defined as the adjectival form of "narration," which, according to Webster's Third New lnternational Dictionary (1963), is "the act or process of telling the particulars of an act, occurrence or course of events." A narrative approach is valuable in the study of Moche art, and many other types of art, because stories are a common means by which religious ideas are transmitted. ldentifying Narrative in Art Stories can describe the activities of gods and mortals as models of reality and for reality (Geertz 1979), explaining the world's origin and the nature of appropriate human behavior. Important rituals recapitulate key acts described in myths (Eliade 1959). For example, the Christian service of the Eucharist repeats the acts of Christ at the Last Supper, albeit, usually in a highly stylized and elaborated form. So, too, human sacrifice among Mesoamerican peoples, especially the Mexica, recapitulated the activities of gods to the point that victims commonly impersonated deities (see Boone 1979). Ceremonies of prisoner sacrifice and blood drinking as depicted in the Presentation Theme (Figure 1) were enacted by the Moche themselves as part of their ceremonial life (Alva 1994; Alva and Donnan 1993; Donnan 1976:127). On this basis alone a strong argument can be made that a story must underlie the Presentation Theme, since it is logical to assume that the organization of the theme, with figures presenting and receiving gob- lets, must be part of a story line. In other words, there must be an explanation as to why particular characters offer and receive goblets instead of some other combination of interacting characters. Elsewhere (Quilter 1990:58), I have argued that the Moche themes most recognizable to mod- ern eyes likely are "key scenarios" (Ortner 1979:95) of Moche ideology. This concept refers to those elements of a myth that are taken as hav- ing the most powerful messages for believers. Donnan (1978: 158) made a similar point by com- paring Moche themes to the limited number of scenes in Christian art, such as the nativity theme depicted on Christmas cards. Kurt Weitzmann (1947:23) uses the term "epitomized cycle" for a section of scenes, more important or more easily understood by viewers, that are taken from a larger context. I also have noted a pattern of "key scenario redundancy" in which the most impor- tant elements of a narrative tend to be more fre- quently represented than events of lesser * * rX slgnlrlcance. There is a considerable body of literature in art history on the nature and role of narrative (Kessler and Simpson 1985; Lavin 1990; Weitzmann 1947; Wickhoff 1900; Winter 1981). These stud- ies, for the most part, investigate pictorial narra- tive in literate societies, and thus a textual reference is almost always available with which to compare figural art. Interestingly, Dorie Reents-Budet (1989) has noted that Maya pictor- ial and hieroglyphic imagery on Maya stelae communicate overlapping messages, rather than one medium, such as the art, exemplifying a sec- tion of the written text. Thus, distinct modes of working with narrative, as well as different approaches to formally representing it, have been identified. Weitzmann (1947), drawing on the work of earlier scholars, describes three ways in which narrative is shown in the art of the classical world. The simultaneous method shows several actions that are sequential in the story taking place at one time in the art. The monoscenic method preserves the unity of time and place by selecting a single significant scene. The cyclic method presents a series of pictures that show a sequence of linked narrational scenes. In using these different approaches, the artist often deviates from a strict story line for a number of reasons. For example, complementary figures may be included in a pic- ture in addition to those required by the text (Weitzmann 1947:15). So, too, a conflation of scenes may occur to condense a story within the physical limits of the artwork (Weitzmann 1947:24). In nativity scenes, the Three Wise Men are often shown in adoration of the infant Jesus in a manger, even though the biblical reference sug-</page><page sequence="5">Quilter] NARRATIVE APPROACH TO MOCHE ICONOGRAPHY 117 Figure 1. Roll-out drawing of the Presentation Theme, after Kutscher 1983:Abbildung 299. gests that they did not arrive until several days later, when the Holy Family was no longer housed in a stable. In regard to what form narration takes when represented, Weitzmann (1947:29) states that the simplest and most frequently used system in nar- ration (applying his cyclic method) consists of scenes in frieze form, with all figures sharing a common ground line. Scenes may follow one another without any divisions, or each scene may be framed and separate from the next. The artist may try to interrelate the scenes with common background features. A second way to depict narration is to subordi- nate scenes to an ornamental pattern for decora- tive purposes, as when sequential events are reordered on a sarcophagus so that the most sig- nificant events are in the most prominent places. A third way is based on inserting scenes into columns of text, a pattern not relevant to Moche iconography. The fourth form of depicting narrative breaks with the sequential nature of representation alto- gether. Each scene becomes isolated and is repre- sented separately. In other words, a segment in a narrational sequence is isolated to the point that it may be unrecognizable, by itself, as part of a nar- rative. This resembles the monoscenic method, and Weitzmann (1947:31) notes that even in the case of literate societies, it is sometimes impossi- ble to prove that a scene has been singled out from a larger cycle in this manner. The challenge is doubly difficult in the art of nonliterate soci- eties such as the Moche. Figures 1, 2, and 3 may now be examined in reference to the above discussion. Figures 1 and 3 both exhibit ground lines. Figure 1 has two ground lines, suggesting that the events in the upper and lower registers either occurred sequen- tially or at the same time in different places.2 Alternatively, the events may be simultaneous in the same locale, and the use of two ground lines serves to maximize descriptive space on the pot- tery vessel on which it is painted. Figure 3 has one ground line that spirals up the vessel (starting at 1). The postures of some of the personages (2, 9, 15, and 16) and the positions of the riders in the boats (12, 13, and 14) suggest that the action and narrative associated with it moves from the bot- tom to the top of the vessel. Figure 2 has no ground line. I have argued elsewhere (Quilter 1990) that narrative can be seen in this image due to the repetition of figures in different situations: 1 is in a commanding role in the lower scene but a captive in the upper one (49), for example. This is an example of simulta- neous method, as discussed above, while Figure 3 demonstrates cyclic method. I also previously suggested that the Presentation Theme, as shown in Figure 1, was a key scenario in a larger narra- </page><page sequence="6">Figure 2.

But without a text as a reference, how can we be sure of this? And even if we can demonstrate that narrative is likely being depicted, how can we attempt to understand the content of the narrative itself? Content of Narrative Art When anthropomorphic beings are depicted in representational styles, patterns that show motions or actions between individuals may serve as a first step in identifying the content of the nar- rative. This approach recently has been followed by Luis Jaime Castillo (1989). It establishes who interacts with whom. Another approach might be termed arche- typal.3 The writings of Mircea Eliade (1959, 1961) and Joseph Campbell (1973), among oth- ers, have proposed a number of themes and narra- tives that are common through time and space. These include such concepts as universal floods, the symbolism of the center/axis mundi, the regeneration of time, and the hero's journey. Furthermore, the writings of anthropologists Arnold Van Gennep (1960), Claude Levi-Strauss (1966), Victor Turner (1967, 1969), and others consistently demonstrate widespread patterns of mythological and ritual behavior that express con- cepts similar to those identified by studies in com- . . . paratlve rellglon. In addition to his work on shamanism (Eliade 1964), Eliade (1959) pointed out the role of ritual in replicating myth. Campbell followed a parallel intellectual path. In The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1973), he argues that hero myths all share a basic plot, even if the specific details of stories differ. The hero's journey described by Campbell is identical in structure to the "Rites of Passage" first identified by Van Gennep (1960 [1908]) and later elaborated by Victor Turner (1969). Both the hero and the initiate return to "normal" society in an altered state after having passed through a lim- inal stage that is dangerous and apart from every- day experience. In the case of the mythic hero, the return is often accompanied by a gift to humans, such as knowledge of fire use or agriculture. These patterns fit securely into the structuralist view of categories as binary opposites mediated by states or personages who defy dualism by combining or transcending such categories. Indeed, a universal theme in religion is the estab- lishment of the present social system by the impo- sition of order on chaos. The narrative associated with the Revolt of the Objects Theme (Quilter 1990) appears to be the manifestation of similar concepts of threats to and assertion (or reasser- tion) of cosmic order as expressed by the Moche (see Golte 1993, 1994a, 1994b). Another approach proposes that there were strong continuities in myth throughout prehistory and into the Colonial era. This assumption runs counter to a major school in Precolumbian art the- ory. George Kubler (1985a) warned of the dan- gers of assuming that the images seen in one archaeological period symbolize the same con- cepts when used several hundred years later in another period. He also argued that during the Colonial period many Precolumbian art motifs became extinct, so that continuities cannot be identified between pre-Colonial times and later periods (Kubler 1985b). While Kubler (1985a:359) also stated that it was the scholar's role to search for disjunctions and continuities, a priori assumptions of disjunction have come to dominate research in many areas of Precolumbian studies, despite other approaches (cf. Coe 1973; Quilter 1997). As noted above with the story of Mollep, there is considerable evidence of cultural continuity on the north coast of Peru. Karl Taube (1988:4-6) has argued that, for Mesoamerica, there are as many, if not more, reasons to assume continuities as there are to assume disjunctions; Joyce Marcus and Kent Flannery (1994) have convincingly argued for the use of the Direct Historical Approach in Oaxaca. Last, there is the question of panregional, and even, pan-American religious and ideological concepts. Much of the research by nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century scholars (e.g., Krickeberg 1928; Seler 1990) has been indiscrim- inately rejected because some of the premises on which such work was based are no longer sup- ported. A few scholars have maintained a broad view of Native American civilization, however (Lathrap 1977, 1985; Roe 1982). As in the case of disjunction vs. continuity, there is no inherent rea- son why a perspective of isolated, separate mythic traditions should not be considered. Commonalities or distinctions are relevant issues, depending on the specific topics under study and</page><page sequence="9">Quilter] NARRATIVE APPROACH TO MOCHE ICONOGRAPHY 121 the level of analysis used to investigate them. There is nothing to stop us, in any event, from comparing Precolumbian cultures to see what we might find that may enlighten us (Benson 1983:76). Rather than seeing Precolumbian pictorial art as simply representing ritual, we must realize that the myth itself is portrayed in ritual. Ritual, myth, and political power were embedded in one another at Sipan (Alva 1994:138, 318) in the same way they were in the contemporary societies of the Maya or the throne rooms of Byzantium. Myth and ritual have long been seen by cultural anthropologists as expressions of the same con- cepts (Bell 1992; Geertz 1973; Leach 1965). Recent field archaeology at Sipan (Alva and Donnan 1993) and at San Jose de Moro (Donnan and Castillo B. 1994)4 have conclusively proved that members of the Moche elite dressed in the roles of supernaturals enacting rituals as seen in art. Excavations also have revealed clear use of the concept of duality in the contrasting and pair- ing of gold and silver objects (Alva and Donnan 1993:221-222), with gold objects or sections of objects on the right-hand side of the wearer and silver on the left (Alva and Donnan 1993:93, 145, 150, Figure 160). We thus now have concrete archaeological evidence of a link between art and behavior. At least some of the scenes rendered as art by the Moche were enacted as rituals (see Hocquenghem 1987). Furthermore, the evidence suggests that these enactments and the myths that they represented were strongly patterned on dual- istic concepts. So too, then, myths seen in art not yet enlightened through field archaeology may be approached assuming the use of dualistic con- cepts, as was argued for interpreting the Revolt of the Objects (Quilter 1990; see Alva 1994: 138). It should be noted that scholars of the thematic approach indeed have recognized the presence of narrative in Moche art. In their discussion of the Burial Theme, Donnan and McClelland (1979) suggest that different scenes shown on the same bottle-burial, assembly, conch-shell transfer, and sacrifice were an ordered sequence, although they were uncertain as to the order in which these events should be placed. More recently, Alva and Donnan (1993:134) note that a depiction of the Presentation Theme (Sacrifice Ceremony) in an upper register is accompanied by a depiction of human combat that preceded the ceremony itself. They also suggest that scenes of warriors and their activities can be grouped into categories that form a "sequential narrative of Moche militarism and the ceremonial activities that follow it" (Alva and Donnan 1993:127). So, too, the work of Castillo (1989:20) is based on the presence of narrative, as are the works of Berezkin (1980) and Golte (1993, 1994a, 1994b). Space prohibits a detailed account of the dif- ferences and similarities in these approaches. In my approach, offered below, I combine icono- graphic analysis with those ethnohistorical and ethnographic materials that can reasonably be demonstrated to have continuities with prehistoric beliefs and practices. This method is based on the linked assumptions that myths are the basis of much of Moche art, that there are continuities in myths from Moche times to the early historic period, and that universally recurring narrative patterns can be used to interpret the myths depicted in Moche art. Applying the Narrative Approach In "The Moche Revolt of the Objects" (Quilter 1990), I argued that narrative could be detected in several Moche painted scenes similar to that shown in Figure 2, which is one of the theme's most detailed versions. I further argued that this scene was a variant of a known myth recorded in the central Andes in the early seventeenth century in a document known as the Huarochiri manu- script (Salomon and Urioste 1991) and that this tale shared important features with sections of the Popol Vuh (Tedlock 1985). I also argued that var- ious Moche themes likely were linked in a narra- tive sequence and tentatively suggested that they might be sequentially arranged as: (1) Revolt of the Objects, (2) Presentation, (3) Burial, and (4) Raft (i.e., Boat) Themes. Analysis of the vessel painting shown in Figure 3 (see also McClelland 1990:Figure 7) sig- nificantly adds to the narrative previously devel- oped. The painting technique on this Moche V pot differs from the two vessels discussed in "The Moche Revolt of the Objects" (Quilter 1990:Figures 3 and 4), which themselves each show a different artistic hand at work. The dis- tinctive characteristics of the vessel's style here under discussion rest chiefly in the use of a</page><page sequence="10">122 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 8, No. 2, 1997 ground line, spiraling up the vessel body and par- alleled, in part, by a wave scroll likely represent- ing the sea; the ground line underscores a continuous band of pictures and indicates the direction of action and narrative, as noted above. Images 1-11 appear to represent a version of the Revolt of the Objects. The lowest image on the vessel is of a warrior (1) recently captured by an animated club and shield (2), surrounded by an ulluchu fruit above and a similar but hard-to-read image between 1 and 2. The captive warrior is dressed, indicating that his defeat has been recent, as Moche captives were stripped of their clothing. The next individual (3) is a captive warrior similar in dress and position to the first one. This prisoner is held by the hair by a tule boat (4). The feature that most distinguishes this boat from oth- ers in Moche art is that the bottles on deck appear to be upside down, standing on the rims of their necks (cf. Kutscher 1983:Abbildungen 31F320). Another waxvior, 5, is almost identical to the other two prisoners and is positioned in the same manner. This figure, however, is not a captive but is shown at the moment of defeat in a fight with 6. He still holds his club, whereas the two previ- ous prisoner figures (1 and 3) only have their shields. Although 6 shows no clear characteristics that identify it as an animated object, it appears to be on the same side as the animated figures pre- ceding it. The head of 6 may be shown as thrown backwards partly to accommodate the large and detailed headdress in the small vertical space on the bottle. Personages 6 and 7 share a distinct fea- ture: both have a distinctive S-shaped nose orna- ment with circular danglers. Because he is drawn larger than the other fig- ures, is seated, and is highlighted by a dark aurora surrounding him, 7 appears to be an important personage. A stylized ulluchu fruit is either part of his headdress or floats in front of it. This figure gesticulates with one hand toward the scene in front of him. Behind him, to the left, 8 and 9 show more of the Revolt of the Objects. A captive (8) holds both club and shield and resembles the other defeated warriors previously discussed; 9 is an animated staff with what appears to be a rope- like object ending in two circles at its upper end. This individual is either giving or receiving an animal-headed staff to 10, or, perhaps, it merely holds the staff as it runs to 10. Curved lines fill in the space between 9 and the staff and between the two circles of rope. Similar lines are found in front of 6 and 7, between the legs and the body and ground line of 5, and to the right of 1. These appear to be rather carelessly drawn wave scrolls. A more carefully drawn group of scrolls is found to the right of 8. Wave scrolls are drawn as a ground line continuously from underneath 8, upward, to the end of the scene. The figure near 10 faces the animated rope- staff. Part of the paint rendering this image appar- ently has not been preserved, but the character is distinctive by its tufted headdress, long skirt, large nose, and animal-headed "rays" projecting in front of it. Behind 10 is a structure (11) that also has lost some of its paint. Wave scrolls roll over its top, and at least three club-and-shield weapons bundles are inside. Three tule boats carrying three distinct person- ages follow 11. This is a major narrative change from the battle scene below. The three individuals in the boats consist of a long-snouted creature with a thick, curling tail and distinctive headdress (12), a figure (13) with the same style headdress as 10, and an individual carrying a long, double- headed feline staff (14). Personage 12 has no ray- like objects surrounding it; 13 has animal-headed rays (similar to 10); 14 has rays in the form of club-and-shield designs and wears the same head- dress as 7. Another major narrative shift then occurs. The next set of figures appears to represent a version of the Presentation Theme. An animated club and shield (15) runs with a cup in his hand with the other hand outstretched, palm open. In front of him is a figure (16) with the same headdress as 14, pointing with his right hand, the other hand apparently holding a plate or lid that covered the cup being drunk from by 17. Seated in a structure with wave scrolls serving as a roof ornament is 17, whose facial features resemble those of 14, but whose headdress is similar to that of 12. Personages 18 and 19 wear similar clothes and headgear and resemble 10 and 13. They are engaged in drinking, as in the Presentation Theme, with 19 seated and 18 presenting the drink; curved lines, resembling those around 5, 6, and 7, float between them. In addition to the weapons bundles shown in 11, another bundle is shown between it and the</page><page sequence="11">Quilter] NARRATIVE APPROACH TO MOCHE ICONOGRAPHY 123 boat occupied by 12. Although the specific mean- ing of weapons bundles is not known, it seems reasonable to suggest that they denote martial activities. The netlike circles connected to the boats by filled-in lines also are enigmatic. They are frequently shown on depictions of Moche watercraft and may be part of their overall struc- ture. If they have any specific symbolic role other than simply serving to denote the form of the ves- sels, such distinctions cannot be made at present. Throughout the scene bottles are shown. Many of these are simply rendered, including what appear to be the upside-down bottles on 4 and upturned bottles in the boat of 14. Other bottles are more carefully painted and float between or above the figures starting between 12 and 13 and continuing to behind 19. Explicating the Narrative Given the analysis above, the narrative on this vessel consists of three parts or phases. The first phase is the Revolt of the Objects, the second is a voyage on water, and the third is a presentation scene that includes drinking. There may be sub- phases too, especially in the first part of the nar- rative. Perhaps the revolt is shown in stages that reflect key elements in the story. The tule raft and the creatures to its right (14) indicate the general revolt and, as will be argued below, the reason for taking prisoners. The seated figure appears to direct events (5-7). The figures in front of the structure (8-11) are in a watery environment, judging by the wave, and the standing figure (10) also appears to have a role in supervising events. In my 1990 article I suggested that the Boat Theme was linked to the Revolt of the Objects and Presentation Themes. If the spiral scenes on the vessel analyzed above support that argument, they also change the sequence I proposed. The sequence of events is: Revolt of the Objects-Boat-Presentation. The sequence is clearly shown on this vessel with the Revolt of the Objects shown in 1-11, a boat scene by 12-14, and a scene resembling the Presentation Theme in 15-19. I argue below, however, that this latter scene is not the same as other presentation themes. It occurs in a different part of the narra- tive, immediately after the revolt, and might be called the "Revolt Presentation Theme," in the sense that this inversion of the correct offenng of sacrificial blood took place as a result of the Revolt of the Objects. It is quite possible that not all boat or presenta- tion themes are directly linked to a larger myth. For example, one representation of the Sacrifice Ceremony shown in Alva and Donnan (1993:Figure 146) may or may not show a scene of the ceremony that replicates the myth shown in other scenes. The potential exists for confusing the two, just as we cannot distinguish between a depic- tion of the mytho-historical event of The Last Supper and a representation of contemporary Christians in the ritual of Holy Communion. We appear to have a narrative sequence that mostly concerns the Revolt of the Objects, within which at least some Boat Theme representations belong. So too, not all animated objects necessarily are part of the Revolt of the Objects. Only when links can be made to other narrative segments can the identifi- cation of the theme be made with some confidence. The spiral-painted bottle raises issues because of the way it varies from other artworks that show the three themes (Revolt, Boat, Presentation) sep- arately. Although there apparently are "short- hand" versions of the Revolt of the Objects Theme, only three other artworks show the myth in detail. Two of them, the mural from the Huaca de La Luna in the Moche Valley and a vessel in Berlin (see Quilter 1990:44 46), show the revolt in progress but provide no indication of its con- clusion. The third representation, on a vessel in Munich (Quilter 1990:45-50), shows the revolt in progress and its defeat. The vanquisher of the ani- mated objects is the Rayed Deity (Figure 2, no. 45), while the Woman, as an instigator of the revolt (Figure 2:1), is later held prisoner (Figure 2:49) by one of the Rayed Deity's warriors (Figure 2:50). The story told on the spiral-painted bottle shows no victory of the Rayed Deity. Instead, it appears to show part of the narrative in which the instigators of the revolt are momentarily tri- umphant. The key to this interpretation lies in the identification of personages on the spiral-painted vase as the Woman. It can be demonstrated that the Woman, or she and her aides, are shown as 10, 13, 18, and 19 inFigure 3. Figure 4 shows a number of versions of the Woman. Hocquenghem and Lyon (1980) have conducted an analysis of representations of this</page><page sequence="12">124 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 8, No. 2, 1997 a e b c g d h Figure 4. Variations in the representation of the Woman. Details are from various Moche vessels after illustrations in Kutscher 1983. The Kutscher figure numbers are in parentheses: a (270), b (267) (see Figure 2, this article), c (299) (see Figure 1, this article), d (314-2), e (318B), f (319), g (320), and h (316B). figure in Moche art, listing 14 different features associated with it, illustrating two of the examples shown here (b and g) and making reference to another (c). Elsewhere (Quilter 1990:48), I sug- gested that (a) should be considered a version of the Woman. Although the detailing is spare for all of the figures on the Berlin vase where she (a) is depicted, her long hair and skirt are both markers of females in Moche iconography. Although ren- dered in small scale, she has a large eye and appears to be bare footed as is generally the case with the other female figures. Gabled structures also are commonly associated with females (Donnan and McClelland 1979:9). Most impor- tantly, all of the personages in question on the spi- ral-painted bottle have headdresses similar to (h) in Figure 4, which Hocquenghem and Lyon rec- ognize as a female deity.</page><page sequence="13">Quilter] NARRATIVE APPROACH TO MOCHE ICONOGRAPHY 125 The fact that more than one female personage is shown in the final scene of the narrative may be read in a number of ways, none of which can be supported more than the other, at present. Presumably, the seated individual, 19, is of higher status than the figure offering the goblet (or footed bowl); or are these two cronies of fairly equal rank, regaling in their success? In either case, the representation of more than one female in the kind of garb portrayed suggests that the sin- gle female figure commonly seen in Moche iconography represents a large cohort of similar characters. These other females are either sub- servient to the principal figure, or all female fig- ures represent a group of spirits or deities with shared or similar powers. If a case can be made that the headdresses of many of the personages (10, 13, 18, and 19) in Figure 3 are associated with the distinctive cos- tume of the Woman, finding congruencies in known art for the rest of the headgear in the spi- ral painting is more difficult. There appear to be three different headdress styles shown in the spi- ral painting: (1) the multiplumed style worn by variants of the Woman, (2) the frontal biplumed headdress, and (3) the frontal crescent headdress. Our problem is that we can only guess at the pos- sible significances or lack of them in variations of these headdresses. For example, it would seem that the extra plume in the headdress of 18 prob- ably is not significant and may either be artistic license or done deliberately to help fill in the space above the figure's head. In the case of 17, the greater number of posterior plumes and their symmetrical arrangement may or may not indi- cate higher status than those who wear similar headgear with fewer plumes. The head coverings of 6 and 15 are not com- mon to Moche art, nor are the figures themselves. The first is the only helmeted warrior in this revolt scene, while the second is an anthropomorphized club and shield. What then might be the associa- tion among 7, 12, 14, 16, and 17? These five fig- ures can be divided into two groups, each with similar headdresses: 7, 14, and 16 as one group, and 12 and 17 as the other. Examination of Boat Theme representations consistently reveals a pair of figures on rafts. One is the Woman; the other, a presumably male per- sonage, almost always wears a headdress identi- cal or very similar to that of our first group (Figure 5). The personages shown in a separate boat, accompanying the female, commonly have frontal biplumed headdresses. In the spiral scene, 7, 14, and 16 also wear the same basic headgear, but whereas the boat scene characters have wave- like designs in back of their headdresses, the spi- ral scene individuals have a fan with streamers. The basic headgear of both boat scene characters and those noted on the spiral-painted bottle seem quite similar; that 14 and many of the Boat scene personages carry double-headed staves suggests they are the same or very closely related person- ages. Frontal bipointed crests and headdresses such as worn by 12 and 17, however, do not appear to have recognizable associations with distinct per- sonages in Moche art as they are commonly found on different kinds of figures. It is interesting to note that the relative power positions of the male figures wearing these different types of head- dresses seem to shift. In the lower register, 7 is in a commanding, seated position. A figure with the same headdress is in the lead boat and is painted bigger in the water travel scene. But the seated figure, 17, drinking from the chalice, wears the same headdress as the animal with the curling tail in the last boat (12), while 16, serving 17, wears the same headdress as the commanding figures, 7 and 14. Personage 14 in Figure 3 is portrayed with rays in the form of club-and-shield bundles. Although the image is small, features of his costume include painted feet and knees, a netlike (or disc- covered) shirt, a painted face, and a headdress that has two frontal plumes and a rear crescent fan with three plumes rising above it. In his hand he holds a staff with animal heads on each end. This figure resembles the individual shown behind the Woman in the Presentation Theme (Sacrifice Ceremony) (Alva and Donnan 1993:Figure 143) (Figure 1, upper register, far right). However, there are distinctions in their headdresses. Differences in headdresses and costume may result not only from stylistic (and mythic) varia- tion over time and space or because they represent slightly different phases of the narrative. They also may be more than simply signifiers of who personages are. They may indicate certain states of being or particular roles that these characters</page><page sequence="14">126 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 8, No. 2, 1997 cZ b c Figure 5. The Boat scene, after Kutscher 1983: a (314-2), b (316A, B), c (319). take on in different myths. For the present, how- ever, let us examine how figures with distinct headdresses and clothes are patterned in Figure 3. In Figure 3 as noted above, 7, 14, and 16 all wear identical headgear; 12 and 17 also wear the same headdresses, and the female characters (10, 13, 18, and 19) also share the same headdresses. If narrative is present, then, the personages repre- sented by 7 and 10 are involved in the Revolt of the Objects, then take a boat ride (14 and 13) with a companion (12) not shown previously in the spi- ral painting. Then they drink from goblets. If we follow the sequence with close attention to the headdresses, a number of interesting pat- terns are revealed in the upper register of Figure 3. First, 16 wears the same headdress as 7 and 14, but is distinguished with avian characteristics in the form of a wing and a beak (or a long nose and protruding tongue). There are two females (18 and 19) also shown. Whether headdresses denote rank or role, it seems reasonable to argue that 16 is the functional equivalent of 7 and 14 in the nar- ration; he has the same role in the narrative struc- ture as the other characters who wear similar headdresses. The more elaborate and narrational scenes on Moche ceramics likely represent condensed ver- sions of the myths that they represent, even</page><page sequence="15">Quilter] NARRATIVE APPROACH TO MOCHE ICONOGRAPHY 127 Figure 6. The Revolt Presentation Theme, after Kutscher 1983:Abbildung 304. though such scenes are some of the most detailed examples of mythic narrative that we possess for study. A host of characters may have participated in the Revolt of the Objects, but only a few are shown in any one scene due to space limitations. While key characters are repeatedly shown to establish the narrative pattern, others may be depicted alternately to present the full inventory of participants in the action within the confines of available space. A final step in analysis is necessary in order to more firmly determine the identity of 7 in Figure 3. It concerns the representation of the ulluchu (Carica candicans)^ a relative of the papaya with strong anticoagulant properties. It was likely used in Moche ceremonies to keep sacrificial blood from coagulating (Wassen 1987). The ulluchu often is shown in the Presentation Theme and in scenes of deer hunting (McClelland 1977). In the former, examples are commonly shown as float- ing in space around figures (Alva and Donnan 1993:Figure 145), and they are sometimes shown next to prisoners being sacrificed (Alva and Donnan 1993:Figure 143). Often, however, they are shown in close proximity to the Woman or the figure under discussion, 7. In Figure 3 one or two ulluchus are shown next to 2; the only other rep- resentation of this fruit is immediately above the nose of 7. In my 1990 article I noted the apparent signif- icance of the tree under which a pleading figure sits in front of the Rayed Deity in the upper regis- ter of the Munich vessel (Figure 2:48). This is the only plant shown in the entire scene. It is possible that the tree is an ulluchu. Although this tree is not identical to ones illustrated by Wassen (1987:Figures 2 and 3), it closely resembles it in the pendulous fruits spaced between branches. While the leaves of the ulluchu vary in shape, the serrated forms done on a very small painting on the Munich vessel generally resemble those of living trees (see Wassen 1987:Figure 6). No other tree depicted in Moche art even closely resembles that shown on the Munich vessel. It thus appears that the male companion of the Woman is closely linked with the ulluchu and its properties. This may be the same personage as the Deity of the Ulluchus, identiEled by Alva (1994:193, 319). For the rest of this paper the male companion of the Woman will be referred to as the Lord of the Ulluchus (el Senor de los Ulluchus).5 I believe that this figure, the ulluchu character, is under the tree on the Munich vessel (Figure 2:48), shown in the Presentation Theme (Figure 1, upper right) and depicted on the spiral painted vessel (Figure 3:7). The last two representations share similar, though not identical, nose orna- ments. The seated figure shown in Figure 6 has a nose ornament almost identical to that of 7 in the spiral scene and has a costume, including a headdress, that closely matches the figure behind the Woman in the presentation scene in Figure 1. Finally, the similar nose ornaments of 6 and 7 in the spiral scene suggest that they are closely related. In my 1990 article, I suggested that one of the person- ages shown twice on the Munich vessel (Figure 2:22 and 48) might be a human or some kind of</page><page sequence="16">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 8, No. 2, 1997 128 being subservient to or serving as an agent for the Owl and the Woman. It is interesting that 6 and 7, who appear to be iconographically linked to the figures in the Munich painting, also seem more involved in the battle of the Revolt of the Objects. That 7 is seated may be another sign of his activ- ities in the revolt, as both figures are shown seated in the Munich scene. The bottles shown on the boats of 4 and 14 and those floating throughout the narrative are often present in other Moche boat scenes, but there is considerable variation as to how such containers are portrayed (Figure 5). They fre- quently are shown with lids or stoppers and sometimes with a single line drawn across their necks. They also are often drawn with a line or lines extending from near or at the neck-body juncture of the vessel to suggest strings or ropes (Figure Sa). A semicircular design on some ren- derings of these pots suggests a rope handle (Figure Sb). This kind of detailing on vessels can be found in the bottles shown outside the boats in Figure 3: in front of 10, between 12 and 13, near the upper end of 14's staff, in front of 15, between 17 and 18, and between 18 and 19. Some of these are more carefully painted than others. The most detailed ones have stoppers, lines across their necks, and full rope-ring han- dles. Stoppered bottles with handles are bottles well suited for transportation. Given that the Presentation Theme and Sacrifice Ceremony are involved with the presentation and consumption of blood (Alva and Donnan 1993; Donnan 1976:117-129), it is reasonable to assume that blood is in these containers. Some boat scenes, such as shown in Figure Sc, show prisoners bound with ropes as well as bottles as cargo. This strengthens the suggestion that the bottles contain blood since the prisoners are living containers of the same substance. The ubiquitous stoppered bottles in the spiral scene are reminders that what is being trans- ported in the oceanic voyage and consumed in the final scene is sacrificial blood. Below, the upside-down bottles on the boat in the revolt scene (4) suggest that they await filling and the source of the blood with which they will be filled appears to be the humans captured by the ani- mated objects. The Narrative and Its Significance The argument for narrative in Moche art first pre- sented in my 1990 article can now be amended and expanded based on further analysis. Since my topic has been narrative, perhaps it is best to pre- sent my interpretation of the iconography dis- cussed here in what may approximate its ancient narrative form: Before the creation of the present world, the order imposed by the gods was disrupted. The Lord of the Ulluchus and the Woman caused the natural order to be reversed. The god and goddess of the night and underworld caused the sun to cease to shine and the seas to rise and swallow the land. Instead of seals chasing and eating fish, the fish chased and ate the seals. Everything was turned upside down. Chaos reigned. Weapons and warrior's regalia came to life. They grew arms and legs, and, sometimes, heads. Weapons bundles took on life and served the forces of dark- ness. They and the animated weapons rose up in rebellion against the warriors of that ancient world. None was safe from the revolt of the objects. The captured warriors were dragged before the Woman and the Lord of the Ulluchus and the Bird, their com- panion in the revolt. They were sacrificed and their blood was kept liquid by the Lord of the Ulluchus. Then the Lord of the Ulluchus and the Woman rode their animated boats across the seas that had covered the earth. In their animated boats they carried the blood the animated objects had taken from humans. They came to their own palace and drank the blood they had taken, served to them by their aides and their animated minions. But the sun [the Rayed Deity] regained his strength. He could not be stopped. He attacked the Woman and the Lord of the Ulluchus with his forces. He brought them to justice. They repented, and were forced ever after to submit to the sun. In repentance, they offered the sun the blood they had taken. Now the sun had the power of the sacrificial blood. The present order was established by the sun. He placed the forces of the Woman and the Lord of the Ulluchus in proper balance and relationship with the rest of the cosmos. From that time forth we have sac- rificed to the sun. We enact the great myth of reviv- ing and sustaining the sun through the presentation of liquid blood to him. We give him and his companions sacrificial blood, so that order will reign and chaos never again will triumph. In the above, the first two paragraphs are the Revolt of the Objects as shown in the various paintings previously discussed (see Quilter 1990). The third paragraph is constructed from the spiral bottle scenes. The fourth paragraph is based on the Munich vessel, and the last three sentences are</page><page sequence="17">Quilter] NARRATIVE APPROACH TO MOCHE ICONOGRAPHY 129 the Presentation Theme put into words. The last paragraph is the logical result of the myth put into ritual action, as is in evidence in the archaeologi- cal remains found at Sipan. While it may err on some points, this recon- struction of the myth conforms solely to the avail- able art and archaeology. For example, I believe it highly likely that the myth told by the Moche probably included a revolt of objects, in general, and a reversal of the roles of all creatures. That is the scenario presented in legends of the revolt in the Huarochiri manuscript (Salomon and Urioste 1991) and the Popol Vuh (Tedlock 1985), both of which are variants of the same basic myth seen in Moche art. However, since only warrior's weapons and regalia are shown in the Moche art, I have restricted the story to them. The reversal of the roles of fish and seals and the idea that a flood accompanied the revolt are found in the drawing on the Berlin vessel (Quilter 1990:Figure 3), and wave scrolls are present underneath the feasting . . _. scene ln Hlgure s. The analysis presented here has opened sev- eral new avenues for the interpretation of Moche art. The sequence of events portrayed on many late Moche vessels and in other art forms has been clarified and has offered a reasonable framework on which to reconstruct a fairly extensive chapter of Moche mythology. It has allowed for the identification of the character I have called Ulluchu and helped link his appear- ance in different scenes. These scenes were pre- viously isolated but can now be linked to others. For example, many of the depictions of animated boats, especially those that show a pair, represent the voyage of the Woman and Ulluchu during the period of chaos at the time of the Revolt of the Objects, although other boat scenes may repre- sent other narratives. Not all presentation themes are equal. Although they appear similar in the general pos- ture of figures and the exchange of goblets and often have been grouped together (e.g., Donnan 1976:Figure 106), Figures 1 and 6 show very different activities. Figure 6 shows the Woman presenting a goblet to Ulluchu. This occurs dur- ing the period of chaos, when these two charac- ters have momentarily triumphed. Figure 1 shows the Woman, the Bird, and Ulluchu pre- senting goblets to the Rayed Deity, who clearly triumphs over them as shown on the Munich vase (Figure 3). This is a crucial difference. Depictions of the Woman giving a goblet to Ulluchu are fundamentally different than when the Rayed Deity receives the goblet. The former should thus be called the Revolt Presentation Theme. Although there are many problems inherent in the narrative approach, the difference in pre- sentation themes highlights one of the limita- tions of the thematic approach. By concentrating on broad formal gestures as represented in art, such as the presentation of goblets by the Woman, and not considering the possibility of change depicted from scene to scene, different examples of art that repeats such gestures con- flated into a single "theme." By concentrating on typology, the thematic approach has advanced our knowledge of Moche art considerably. While there is still much to be done using this method, the narrative approach offers new insights into the past. This approach is not purely subjective. Competing interpretations of Moche art and myth can be evaluated in terms of how closely alternate readings fit the observable data and the degree of parsimony in each argument. Furthermore, the reconstructions of myths can be evaluated against new evidence. I, myself, in this present work, have revised the narrative sequence I proposed in my 1990 article. Future discoveries of murals and other artworks offer the possibility of discovering more narrative links that may modify or expand current interpretations. Such further work also will clarify the relations of animated objects, in general, to the Revolt of the Objects, since some animations may be associated with other myths or ideas. By attempting to understand the meanings and messages of ancient art, we naturally put our- selves at risk of misinterpretation or of imposing our own views, conscious or unconscious, on dif- ferent, past ideologies. But these kinds of investi- gations, such as Lathrap's study of the Tello Obelisk (Lathrap 1971,1973,1977,1985), open new paths to understanding the past. They do not produce epiphenomenal studies of epiphenome- nal things, but enlighten us on what motivated past human behaviors and may more clearly show what those behaviors were.</page><page sequence="18">130 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 8, No. 2, 1997 Conclusions The narrative approach to Moche iconography offers the opportunity to resurrect the myths of an important nonliterate culture that dominated the north coast of Peru over a thousand years ago. Such a task is fraught with difficulties, but the rewards are great. By attempting to identify the beliefs of the ancient Moche, we will not only understand them and Peruvian antiquity better, but we also will add to the corpus of the religions of the world. And what can we say, for now, of the deeper meaning of the myth as so far reconstructed and retold? At present, many of the unique aspects of Moche mythology remain to be delineated, but we can more clearly see how their thoughts com- pare to other world religions. One also may pon- der the question of why the narrative form became more pronounced late in the Moche art style. Earlier phases of pottery present more iconic images, often standing alone and not clearly linked with a story. Perhaps the stories were known well enough that the narrative links did not have to be portrayed, and these images represent isolated sections of narrative, as dis- cussed above. Simple evolutionary schemes are insufficient explanations for the move to story telling in pictures. Perhaps the depictions were partly due to the need to present new interpreta- tions of old myths. All religions present a model of reality and for reality, in Geertz's (1979) phrasing. Key religious myths state how the present order came to be, often emphasizing the establishment of a special, commonly renewed, relationship between humans and the divine. Passover and the subse- quent Exodus instituted both new rituals and new relations between God and humans in Judaism, and similar events mark the same passage in Christianity and Islam. The sacrifice of Tonatiuh in the creation of the Fifth Sun instituted the cult of sacrifice and the relationship it entailed between the Mexica and their gods. So too, the Moche myth explicated the past, present, and future of Moche existence. The world once was not as it is now. Chaos reigned, but order was established. The taking and drink- ing of human blood was seized from the hands of negative forces and brought into a system that reaffirmed human relations with positive super- natural forces. In this sense, the Moche myth res- onates with Amazonian beliefs in which sacred ritual (such as the use of flutes) was once in the hands of women, but was captured and controlled by men who now reign in the present order. But it also shares in more widely spread sentiments, such as the transformation of an instrument of Roman domination and brutality into the symbol of redemption in the Cross. This may be an oversimplification, however, and the danger of the archetype approach is that it may too easily subsume different religious ideas and expressions into a homogenized unity. We must therefore try to highlight the distinctive fea- tures of Moche religious thought at the same time that we may use recurring worldwide patterns in attempts to investigate it. One distinguishing fea- ture seems to be that the Moche celebrated the Revolt of the Objects, in a fashion. There may have been social and political reasons for doing so: to preach the message that such chaos would come again if the status quo was not supported. It may be, however, that another sensibility was expressed in these images of a world turned upside down. They may reflect the ancient Andean con- cern with dynamic, dual opposition (Burger and Salazar-Burger 1993). Reality cannot exist with- out asymmetric forces that, through their apparent contrasting vectors, bring the world into balance. What insights are provided by the fact that the Moche chose to use narrative forms in their art during the waning days of their existence as a cul- ture? Hayden White (1987) states that the devel- opment of narrative history in Western Europe was hailed as a move to "objectivity," but that such narrating was founded on moralizing judg- ments. Such moralizing comes about because a narrative, by definition, ends with a closure in which the concluding events are the result of actions that occur earlier in the narrative: plot cre- ates a moral universe. White discusses text-based histories of human events. I have been discussing artistic representations of mythical events. Even though the myths in question may have been told for a long time, that the late-phase Moche chose to represent them resulted in a process inverse to the one White describes. While the narration of history gave "reality the odor of the ideal" (White 1987:21), the depiction of Moche myth gave the ideal the odor of reality.

Museum of Cultural History, an appearance of meaning, religious narrative gives mythological meanings the appearance of "historical" reality. The end result is the same, however, for both processes conElrm that the world is secure and that there is meaning and structure to the events in which humans (and the gods) participate. There is a particularly didactic quality to these representations, as if the Moche had to remind themselves of their myths and their signiElcances. That such scenes are painted on portable ceramic containers, meant to be viewed by a single person at close range, and also are on large walls in major temples for view by larger audiences, suggests that, whatever the messages of these scenes, they were reverberating through Moche society, from the musings of individuals to larger social units. Whatever concerns such musings or sacral cho- ruses raised, the sun did die for the Moche within a few generations after these artworks were made. Acknowledgments. This paper is dedicated to the memory of Donald W. Lathrap, who was an inspiration in interpreting the prehistory of ancient America. My thanks to Leslie Bessant and Richard Burger for extensive comments on draft versions of this article. John Pohl offered helpful insights into icono- graphic theory and so did Carol Callaway, Herbert Kessler, Elizabeth Newsome, and David Wright. Conversations with Karl Taube also were illuminating. Reviewers Daniel Arsenault and Garth Bawden provided critical commentary that added greatly to the revised version of this paper, as did the criticisms of a third, anonymous reviewer. Jurgen Golte drew my atten- tion to the spiral-painted bottle and helped me to begin the development of this paper by providing me with a copy of the roll-out drawing shown as Figure 3. I very much appreciate his collegial interest and support. Although we disagree on a num- ber of issues, Christopher Donnan and Donna McClelland were supportive in offering critiques that helped me clarify my ideas and improve this paper. So too, Elizabeth Benson has offered critical but well-intentioned commentary. Michelle Fuerch was of vital assistance in working out the details of the Spanish translation of the abstract and is heartily thanked. Janice Williams was a great help in producing the final manu- script copy. Finally, the aforementioned anonymous reviewer stated that unless I am channeling directly to a Moche infor- mant, I should not make up a Moche myth. I claim no such psy- chic powers, and while alternate interpretations of the art may be possible, I believe the one I have offered is the most rea- sonable, given the evidence. If anyone is listening, however, and I've got it wrong, I apologize, which may be a New Age way of saying "any mistakes are solely the fault of the author." References Cited Alva, W. 1994 Sipan.

Por example, on the "Today Show," Katie Couric, at Disney World (6/26/95), interviewing impersonators of "characters" from the Pocahontas film stated: "Pocahontas really married someone else . . but that's history, that's not real." 2. The lower ground line shown in Pigure 3, beneath 1-7, is the edge of the low pedestal base of the vessel. It is painted a solid color. There is enough room and Moche artists were suf- ficiently meticulous and able to have decorated such a base with wave scrolls if so desired. The solid color was likely deliberate, indicating solid ground in the pre-flood world. 3. "Archetype," here, is not used in the psychological sense of Jung but that of Eliade (1958:viii-ix), who provides synonyms for the term as "exemplary model" or "paradigm." Since "par- adigm" has subsequently come to have its own associations with concepts of stasis and change, I have elected to use Eliade's "archetype" term. 4. The recent discovery of painted friezes at the Huaca Cao Viejo, E1 Brujo, in the lower Chicama Valley, is of consider- able importance in shedding light on Moche culture (Pranco et. al. 1994:Pigure 4.12, Laminas III-VI; Morris and Von Hagen 1993:78, 81, Pigure 70). Some of the extensive murals show processions, while others show interacting figures. Detailed analysis of the murals remains to be done. At least some of them appear to possibly represent episodes from myths, though other decorative programs also appear to be in evidence. 5. I have chosen a slightly different name until such time as sufficient research identifies Alva's deity and the personage I have discussed as the same individual.</page></plain_text>
