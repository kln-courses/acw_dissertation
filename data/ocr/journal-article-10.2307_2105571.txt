<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION THE CONCEPT OF SELF IN THE UPANISHADS: AN ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION Traditional interpretation of the concept of self Atman and its identifi- cation with Brahma (the creative source of the universe) has been in terms of some form of idealism with emphasis on either "pure contentless consciousness" (Nirguna ideal) or some form of Hegelian Absolutism (Saguna ideal). Since the concept of a "pure consciousness" could make no sense to the common man, and since no satisfactory relationship could be conceived between a transcendent creative principle of consciousness and the empirical world of nature and man, such an approach was repudiated by the classical naturalistic school of Charvakas as well as by the historical Buddha. It is not the purpose of this paper to adjudicate in the interminable disputes concerning the relation between Brahma and the world of nature on the one hand, and between Brahma and man on the other. Nor is it the aim of this paper to underwrite the rejective and "reductive" materialism of the Charvkas (as they have been portrayed by classical idealistic commentators on the Upanishads. I wish to put forward an alternative interpretation on the concept of self in the Upanishads - which will place the whole quest of the Upanishadic seers in an intelligible perspective. I intend to sidestep the question of reconciling the various strands of thought found in the Upanishads, and wish to concentrate on their main thrust in a sympathetic manner. I shall steer clear of the entire classical hairsplitting scholarship which, in my view, missed the point of this ancient quest that has exercised a con- tinuing influence on subsequent Indian thinkers. It is now well known that as we approach the Upanishadic period, the early robust polytheistic naturalism of the R.g-Vedic poets was moving gradually toward the search for a deeper principle of intelligibility. The probing Aryan mind was tremendously impressed by the spectacle of nature - the rising sun, the round of seasons and all the phenomena of the ceaselessly changing world with its infinite inexhaustible mystery. All this staggered and at the same time stimulated their imagination. The 390</page><page sequence="2">THE CONCEPT OF SELF IN THE UPANISHADS 391 NMisadiya Sakta 1 bears eloquent testimony to this irrepressible quest. This was both a natural and a spiritual quest. It was natural for the vigorous Aryan mind to be provoked 'by this changing panorama of nature and to seek for some unifying principle of order behind the manifest diversity. At the same time, it was dissatisfied with any halfway, tentative principle which stopped short of an 'ultimate' explanation. This showed their spirit of persistent inquiry directed toward the unraveling of the inexhaustible mystery of existence. It was, therefore, some kind of a 'spiritual' quest since it manifested the basic spirit of man. To those early settlers there was, as yet, no 'dichotomy' between nature and spirit, or between man and nature. The main thrust of the Upanishadic seers was toward a unifying principle of intelligibility behind the changing multiplicity of objects and events. It was a search of the human spirit both for certainty (freedom from all doubt) and for some kind of eternity (freedom from the flux of things and events). This appears to be the reason why those Upanishadic thinkers were dissatisfied with 'locating' this ultimate principle of intelligibility within the causal-historical order. It was not meant to be a search for a temporal explanation of the changing phenomena of nature. In short, it was not yet a scientific quest but purely a philosophical one, namely for the ground of phenomena. There was, therefore, a conspicuous shift toward an allegedly trans- historical and transtemporal- unifying source of the universe. Subsequent Indian thought has ever since retained this transtemporal dimension. Such an imaginative 'spiritual' quest was supposed to be fulfilled by the dis- covery of the concept of Brahma - which meant, etymologically, the creative source which grows, and the organizing principle wihch mani- fests itself in the universe. Brahma was regarded as the final principle of intelligibility and as such was in no need for further explanation. To ask for its explanation was to miss the nature of the very concept of Brahma and to fall into logical absurdity and conceptual incoherence. How is this concept different from that of nature? Surely the Upanishadic thinkers were not in search of' partial explanations in terms of the nature gods. Such anthropomorphism was rejected. Nor was there, as yet, any idea of bifurcating the universe into mind and matter because they were seeking for a unifying ground of all the phenomena of nature including man. The concept of Brahma satisfied one aspect of their search - namely for an eternal principle behind the changing flux of things and events. But what about the other aspect of their quest - that for certainty and freedom from all doubt? What could be more certain than our own self? A persistent phenomenological inquiry into the nature 1 Rg Veda, x. 129.</page><page sequence="3">392 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH of the self began. It will be an error to regard this inquiry as psychologi- cal and crudely introspective. The successive identifications of the 'I" with food, breath,2 the mind and consciousness were found to be unsatis- factory and were, therefore, rejected.3 This inquiry was therefore not the same as that of Hume who conducted a psychological-introspective inquiry into the self and arrived at the conclusion that there was no such self apart from the rapidly flowing flux of ideas and impressions. Hume was lured by the idea that the self if there was any, could be given to conscious introspection. He soon discovered that this was a chimerical and elusive quest. But Hume failed to see that such a psychological quest for the self or the "I" was conceptually an incoherent quest because any attempt to conceive the self as an object of consciousness (whether it was body, breath, idea or impression) turned what was supposed to be the subject into an object. In other words there was a kind of "systematic elusiveness," a la Ryle,4 about the self. Whereas thinkers like Wittgenstein and Gilbert Ryle traced the supposed elusiveness of the self to the "bewitchment of language," the early Upanishadic thinkers were mysti- fied, intrigued and overawed by this elusive concept of the self. However, they should be credited as against Hume, with a basic phenomenological insight that the self as subject could not be given to conscious introspec- tion but could only be experienced and given in consciousness as its subject. In other words, the self, as thinking subject, could not be its own object in one and the same act of thinking. This is not only a psychological but a logical impossibility. An act of thinking as an exist- ential occurrence is concerned with an object other than itself, though later on, it, in its urn, can become an object of another "higher" level of thinking act. And thus the Upanishads came out with what is regarded as the most famous statement Tat Tvam Asi (That Thou Art) declaring the identity of Brahma (the creative and unifying principle of the universe) with the Atman (the deepest self) conceived as the unchanging subject to which the whole temporal order is an object. This fulfilled the second aspect of their quest, namely, that for certainty and freedom from doubt. Brahmna was not an 'external' hypothetical principle. It was our innermost self - the eternal 'I' which is the same behind the multiplicity of phenomenal egos. How are we to interpret this identification? Several commentaries 2 Cf. W. James' attempt to equate the Kantian "I think" with "I breathe" in his famous chapter on "Does Consciousness Exist?" in Essays in Radical Empiri- cism and a Pluralistic Universe, New York: Longmans, Green and Co., 1943.

It is difficult to put ourselves, even imaginatively, in the mental framework of those early thinkers to realize exactly what they meant by this identification. Brahma was supposed to be a trinity of existence, consciousness and bliss. Its first aspect, namely, existence was meant to emphasize that such a principle was real and not merely a figment of the imagination. The whole of nature (including human beings) was a temporal manifestation of this unifying source. Despite the phenomenal diversity of nature and empirical selves, this identification was meant to emphasize the unity of the whole universe. It was at once a call and an invitation to man to realize imaginatively and intuitively his identity with this creative source. Thus the harmony between man and nature and the unity of both with the intelligible source seemed to be the motive for this identification. The chief merit of this identification was that the whole universe was traced to one unifying principle and the phenomenal world was not dichotomized into nature and man. The whole temporal world including empirical selves was in a continuous process of becoming. Such a conception retained the early naturalistic temper of the Vedic poets but it understood nature in an imaginative, comprehensive and deepened sense. This naturalistic insight was missed by some classical commentators who turned the doctrine to some kind of absolute idealism and interpreted Brahma (and Atman) in terms of 'pure' consciousness, and relegated the natural world and the empirical selves to the position of Maya- an illusory or at least a lower order of reality. Such an interpretation created its well-nigh insoluble problem of relating such a transcendent conscious principle to the empirical world of change. Not only this, but also a sweeping moral devaluation of the empirical world and empirical pursuits was implied without any discrimination. A more plausible interpretation of this con- cept of Brahma (and Atman) can be given in terms of an imaginatively conscious human search for a unifying principle of intelligibility. This ultimate principle is evidently not a thing, an object, event, body, mind, idea or consciousness. It cannot logically be identified with anything. The very concept of Brahma or Atman excludes all such partial identifications as logically incoherent and discrepant. The Brhdaranyaka UpanIghad rightly stresses the Neti, Neti (not this, not this) character of this ultimate principle. What remains, therefore, is the imaginative search, the 'spirit- ual' quest of man for a unifying principle. This is specifically a human quest - a conscious inquiry. This explains why the Upanishadic thinkers regarded it as 'pure' consciousness - the second aspect of Brahma. It was quite natural for them to wonder how man with his consciousness and his incessant 'spiritual' quest could ever owe his existence to an uncon-</page><page sequence="5">394 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH scious principle. But to take it literally and to interpret this ultimate principle as 'pure' consciousness is to miss the all too human and poignr ant quest of man for ultimate meaning and significance. That such an interpretation of Brahma or Atman is highly plausible is borne out by its third alleged aspect, namely bliss or ananda. Now bliss is seemingly an anthropomorphic concept. And yet, it is used here in a sense different from that of the ordinary concepts of happiness and joy. One who attains a conscious unification with Brahma or Atman - the creative and organizing principle of the universe - is supposed to be transported to a plane of experience which is 'out of this world.' It is bliss itself. In such an experience the narrow confines of petty egoistic concerns are 'transcended,' and such a transcendence manifests itself in all of one's activities. To interpret Brahma (or Atman) in this manner is to take out all mystery from the concept and to give 'transcendence' its most acceptable meaning. Any person who, through conscious effort, imaginative insight and moral endeavor, rises above his selfish concerns, understands the nature of the temporal order and realizes the common unifying source of the universe, experiences 'transcendence.' It is obvious that such a unifying principle cannot be seen or heard or touched, etc. All unifying principles are to be realized, "intuited" and experienced imaginatively. Such an experience transforms one radically and one can be said to 'understand' (attain prajfiana) the world of tem- poral flux for what it is. No wonder the word for philosophy in India is darshana (insight). There is no harm in designating such an insight as spiritual provided the word 'spiritual' is not taken as denying the obvious characteristics of the natural world, or as implying an airtight 'bifurca- tion' of the world into the natural and the spiritual. It appears to me that the Upanishadic thinkers did not commit such an egregious error. It would certainly be naive and puerile to devalue and deny the diversity of the natural world. At the same time this search for, and this imagina- tive insight into the unifying principle of intelligibility is to be regarded as a natural, human and spiritual concern. One wonders how such an interpretation of Brahma could be different from an imaginative, en- riched and deepened concept of nature which has the potentiality of manifesting the diversity of life, consciousness as well as the 'spiritual' concerns of man. Such an organizing and unifying pirnciple (to be real- ized in a conscious human experience of unification) need not be con- ceived to be aloof and 'transcendent.' This interpretation will do away with the well-nigh insoluble puzzles which arise when Brahma as the unifying principle is reified into the capitalized solidity of Transcendent Reality, and the temporal world denigrated and devalued into mere maya or an appearance. The Upanishadic concept of Brahma or Atman, instead</page><page sequence="6">THE CONCEPT OF SELF IN THE UPANISHADS 395 of repudiating the reality and diversity of the natural world, should be construed as adding a new dimension to it in terms of its creative and unified source. Historically speaking, however, the dominant interpretation of the Upanishadic thought has been monistic, idealistic and absolutistic with sometimes an implied and sometimes an avowed devaluation of the diver- sity of the natural world. Such an absolutistic interpretation of Brahma coupled with the irrepressible facts of the natural world gave rise to the dualisms and dichotomies of the Absolute and the world, the empirical selves (Jivas) and the transcendent Self (Atman), etc. No doubt, there is textual support for such an interpretation but this cannot have been the spirit and the total thrust of the Upanishadic thought. The Katha Upanishad, for example, makes a distinction between the empirical self and the Great Self (Atman) and points out that to the latter no concep- tual categories apply (Katha, II. 18-20, 20-5; III. 3, 4, 7-8, 10-15). Using the metaphor of the chariot it conveys that the Transcendental Self is beyond the body, senses and mind, and is to be realized in tranquil and contemplative experience. The Mundaka Upanishad makes use of the metaphor of the birds sitting on the same tree - one as the empirical self and the other as the eternal and transcendental self (Mundaka, III. i. 1-3). It speaks of the former as "eating sweet fruit" and the latter as "looking on without eating." These poetic metaphors have been taken literally by many scholars to mean that there really are two selves, and that only the empirical self (Jiva) is caught in the causal nexus and the action cycle while the transcendental self is a pure witness to the tempo- ral cycle of doings and undergoings, births and deaths (Sams-ara) of the empirical ego. Such a concept of the transcendental self (to be realized in a contemplative experience) has functioned as a transtemporal back- drop to the historical development of Indian thought since the times of the Upanishads. This transhistorical quest has exercised a deflecting in- fluence on genuine efforts to bring about rapid social change in India. A continuous tension between what may be called the vertical transsocial ideal and the horizontal social-historical demension has split Indian thought and culture since then. If India is to regain the dynamism and robust naturalism (which properly understood is, however, not opposed to the 'spiritual' quests and concerns of man) of the early Aryan settlers, is has to recapture the spirit of the ancient teaching, give up a literalistic interpretation of the Atman doctrine, and understand that Brahma (or Atman) is to be taken as a unifying principle of intelligibility without hypostatizing it as Transcendental Reality opposed to the natural world</page><page sequence="7">396 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH of change and continuity. A repudiation of such a schizophrenic split while retaining a practical vision of unification will, in my opinion, hasten the pace of social change in India for human and humane pur- poses. D. C.
