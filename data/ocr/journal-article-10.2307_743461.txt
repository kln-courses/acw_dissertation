<plain_text><page sequence="1">Justice, Mercy, and Gender in Rabbinic Thought Suzanne Last Stone L Introduction The recent explosion of interdisciplinary work linking religion, liter- ature, cultural anthropology, feminism, and other fields of inquiry to the study of law in the modern state share a common perspective. They each, in diverse ways, view the state, not as the product of a political arrange- ment, but, rather, as a cultural system that has "reoccupied" the functions of the large cultural systems, the religious community and the familial realm, from which - as well as against which - it emerged.' This work seeks to make visible the theological ideas, gender assumptions, and emo- tional elements that underlie modernist law. The study of ancient litera- ture about law has proved particularly helpful in this project because these ancient texts provide a more transparent picture of the emotional, reli- gious, and socio-sexual aspects of law.2 One important line of inquiry in this work that I draw on here traces how our modern definition of justice is informed by inherited ideas about the quality of justice exercised by a model divine being and the different forms of justice men and women are capable of effecting. In this essay, I wish to extend and to challenge aspects of this work through a detailed analysis of a rabbinic midrash, a narrative that deals with the tension between justice and mercy, both divine and human, in terms of gender imagery. In doing so, I hope to continue Robert Cover's project of placing before us what he called "the folktales of justice" - alternative visions of justice - which he also so often culled from the vast corpus of midrash, the imaginative rabbinic commentary on the Bible.4 Our midrash touches on several important debates in contemporary legal theory. In law, as in other disciplines, few topics have exerted so strong a hold on the contemporary imagination than that of the "Other," whether the quintessential other is woman, God, the Jew, or, as for Israel, the other nations. Feminist theory has been particularly forceful in analyzing how 139</page><page sequence="2">we traditionally define the other over against the self through the con- struction of contrasting traits. Thus, the duality of self and other in terms of male and female is replicated in a series of binary oppositions, in which male and female are contrasted and asymetrically valued in terms of char- acteristics such as reason and emotion, abstract justice and mercy, and impartiality and passion. Indeed, from its inception in the work of Simone de Beauvoir, feminist theory has linked the issue of gender to the larger problem of dualism in Western metaphysics.5 The asymmetrical valuing of male and female is part and parcel of the traditional philo- sophic dichotomy between reason and emotion, with justice associated with dispassionate reason and mercy with passion and emotion. Because in all these sets of opposed terms the former is the privileged one in modern legal culture, contemporary theory points out we have an impoverished view of the possibilities for law. Not only do we fail to rec- ognize, for example, that justice and mercy are intertwined, we fail to investigate the emotional attitudes that lie behind these legal and philo- sophic concepts. One of the aims of contemporary legal theory is to break down these rigid dichotomies between reason and emotion, justice and mercy, or the masculine and feminine, in order to rescue law from its cold abstraction and to inject into law a broader spectrum of human attribut- es and emotions.6 Perhaps the greatest attraction of midrash for late 20th century liter- ary and legal scholars is that it has the capacity to transcend such tradi- tional Western dichotomies as law and literature or reason and emotion. Midrash is neither fiction nor legal exegesis; neither abstract legal theory nor psychology. Rather, it is the law made fluid through a literary inves- tigation of the emotional dynamics that underlie legal and moral con- cepts. The midrash I present exemplifies this "'mixed' discourse."7 Our midrash resembles a fantastic folktale, a story about a heavenly trial to decide the fate of the exiled Jews and whether they merit redemption. Yet, the midrash is also a commentary on the Bible and prior rabbinic tradi- tions, allusively cited or otherwise condensed within the narrative. When read in light of these texts and traditions, the story emerges as an elabo- rate exploration of the legal and moral concepts of justice and mercy. Our midrash treats the concepts of justice and mercy as abstract manifestations of the emotional attitudes of jealousy and love, thus bridging the tradi- tional philosophic dichotomy between reason and abstract justice, on the 140</page><page sequence="3">one hand, and emotion and mercy, on the other. Divine justice and mercy emerge not as opposing characteristics, but, rather, as two polarities of a unified whole. Similarly, the standard depiction of God as male is reversed. Through metaphoric extension, God is portrayed as a merciful female who is, in turn, the model for all human behavior, male or female. This cross-cultural and trans-historical example thus broadens our hori- zon of what forms of justice are possible for men and for women. Our midrash also touches on what Geoffrey Hartman has called "the problem of the other as it affects intellectual history."' The treatment of divine and human justice in our midrash provides a needed corrective to recent accounts of how modernist law replicates "masculine" authoritari- an patterns inherited from the religious realm, particularly from the "patriarchal," monotheistic tradition of Judaism. These writings build on feminist criticism of the monotheistic idea, which argues that in monotheism, precisely because there is only one God, there is room only for the projection of male experiences onto the divinity. Ancient Judaism figures prominently in these analyses as the inaugurator and purest form of the monotheistic idea.9 Yet, contemporary legal theory and, in partic- ular, various feminist writings, too often replicate the very dualisms they seek to surmount, either in tracing the structure of modernist law to the "male" God of biblical monotheism"0 or in adopting as the definition of the "feminine" those characteristics that stand in opposition to the dom- inant, hence, "masculine," discourse of law." Indeed, one can trace a series of dualisms in recent "difference feminist" writings, which juxtapose and asymetrically value the idea of compassion over abstract justice, connect- edness over impartiality, the feminine (and often Christian) figure of mercy over the male biblical God of justice and hierarchy, and even the idea of pluralism over the idea of monotheism. Indeed, one might argue that these and other recent writings are part of an odd resurgence of the ancient cultural war between monotheism and polytheism. In the contemporary era, polytheism connotes the idea of pluralism, a deep structure of feminist and other late 20th-century critical thought. The contemporary version of this ancient cultural struggle pits monothe- ism, conceived as a cold, masculine, monistic, hierarchical, abstraction, against the idea of pluralism and all that it implies: an openness to the diversity and variety of human emotions and passions, competing per- spectives, pluralist law, and pluralist conceptions of truth. Consider, for 141</page><page sequence="4">example, Jean Elshtain's provocative essay entitled "Sovereign State, Sovereign God, Sovereign Self," which attempts to construct a politics of monotheism.12 The monotheistic idea posits a single, indivisible, divine (male) sovereign, who has absolute dominion over domestic space. The political structure of the modern state, with its insistence on one law for everyone enforced top-down, thus precisely replicates the monotheistic structure, with its focus on one final will "brought to bear on cacophony and chaos.""13 This idea of a unified will, whether that of the "male" God of the monotheistic tradition or that of the state, is also tied, Elshtain argues, to the "masculine" conception of the self as autonomous and sov- ereign. One of the projects of feminist theory, Elshtain implies, is to dis- entangle the knot of sovereign God, sovereign state, and sovereign self by considering the possibility of multiple sovereigns, plural and overlapping legal orders within the borders of the state, and a vision of the self as rela- tional, rather than autonomous. Similarly, various feminist writings draw a connection between the "masculine," hierarchical structure of monotheism and theories of judg- ing that stress objectivity, impartiality, hierarchy, and the preeminent role of reason in adjudication.'4 In its place, "difference feminists" seek to incorporate into law an "ethic of care," a jurisprudence of "compassion," or even "maternal thinking," to counter the masculine focus on rights and rules. These jurisprudential theories share a "basic thesis of connection," resting on a vision of the feminine self as forming its identity through relationships, and an attention to the emotional aspects of legal decision- making, that are intended to contrast sharply with the biblical vision of the judge as disinterested and disengaged.'5 Taken together, these writings raise the important question whether it is possible for modernist law to break free of a cultural system that is so strongly linked to the image of the dispassionate, impartial, unified, "male" God of justice who man emulates. Such ambitious attempts to trace a culture's contours to its inherited ideas about God are not new.'6 Hume, for example, in his essay on the natural history of religion, rooted the sources of both polytheism and monotheism in human nature and compared their respective approaches to political order. Monotheism, according to Hume, posits a single rational agent reflected in the unity of nature. Because of its dedication to one single object of devotion, monotheism pursues a singular conception of truth, which it imposes on 142</page><page sequence="5">everyone. Polytheism, by contrast, arises out of a concern with "the vari- ous and contrary events of human life.""17 It projects this variety and diver- sity of human emotions, aims, and experiences onto the divine order. Accordingly, Hume writes, polytheists are pluralistic and thus more open to different viewpoints than monotheists. These depictions of the monotheistic idea of the Bible suffer from "the fact ...that Judaism remains the unacknowledged 'other' in Western or so-called Judeo- Christian tradition.... "" Because Jewish writing after the Bible is largely unknown in Western culture, Jewish thinking about political order is identified exclusively with the Bible, unmediated by later Jewish writings and shaped by centuries of Christian reading. Yet, as an historical matter, the monotheistic idea that was transferred to the theory of the state is the product of Romano-canonical law received into the West, a tradition that defined itself in opposition to the nonphilosophic midrashic and talmu- dic methods of legal discourse, which it explicitly judged unreasonable. The politics of monotheism began with the early Christian equation of one God with "one bishop," and the establishment of an elaborate church hierarchy,"9 a system foreign to Jewish political thought. Similarly, the long history of intellectual thinking in the West about divine justice and mercy continues to be filtered through a Christian read- ing of the Bible that ignores the rabbinic approach to this important topic. Because of the common juxtaposition of the biblical God of vengeance and justice, who punishes every violation of his law, with the New Testament God of forgiveness and love, all too often the cultural ori- gin of the idea of compassion and mercy is ascribed to Christian sources.20 This tendency continues to influence feminist writings, much of which - even in the American legal academy - are situated in a Christian con- text. German feminist writings, as recently described by Susannah Heschel,21 have gone so far as to locate the mentality of Nazism in the male monotheistic God of vengeance of the Old Testament that culmi- nated in the rabbinic tradition, with its supposed emphasis on imperson- al law, rules, and authoritarianism. And they contrast this patriarchal vision with the "female" values of compassion, love, and interpersonal relationships introduced by Jesus. A central image of God in the Bible is, to be sure, God as judge, a dis- penser of divine justice, whose justice must be emulated, as far as possi- ble, on earth. And, in various places, the Bible describes the qualities of 143</page><page sequence="6">divine justice in terms of dispassion, vengeance, and exactitude - com- monly referred to as strict justice according to law. The key motif is in Exodus 34:14, which proclaims: "I am a jealous God," implying exclu- sivity and retribution. Yet, in other places in scripture God restrains his jealousy and anger and acts mercifully, inaugurating a tension between justice and mercy. John Noonan points out that this tension between mercy and justice, apparently dealt with in the Bible through a temporal division (some- times God acts justly and at other times mercifully), is handled in the Christian tradition through a role division, the attribution of strict justice to God (and later judges) and mercy to the figure of Christ (and later the church as intercessor for pardon after judgment).22 Thus, the tension between justice and mercy, although never resolved was, nonetheless, accommodated in the Christian model because "different individuals could be just and others could have a different role appealing for mercy."23 Yet, the role division that Christianity introduced reinforces the philo- sophic dichotomy between reason and emotion in law, the very problem contemporary theory seeks to correct. Law becomes the affair of judges who are to emulate a Christian picture of the impartial biblical God of justice while mercy becomes a matter of grace, outside the sphere of jus- tice. In contrast, our midrash, the product of the monotheistic and andro- centric community of classical rabbinic Judaism, gives us an alternative, richly personified picture of a model divine being, replete with male and female imagery, and a complex description of justice and mercy as the two constant, complementary attributes of God - a portrayal drawn from the rabbis' own reading of the Bible. In what follows I first set the midrash within the larger topic of rabbinic thought about divine justice and mercy and then provide a short primer on reading midrash. After allowing the midrash to speak for itself, I shall dissect the narrative on two levels: first, as a meditation on the emotional attitudes that underlie the legal concepts of justice and mercy and second, as a window onto the role of the femi- nine in rabbinic thought. 144</page><page sequence="7">II. Our Midrash A. Historical and Hermeneutic Forward In dealing with the tension between divine justice and mercy, the midrashic rabbis, careful readers of texts, focus on the fact that in Exodus 34:6-7, two descriptions of God are counterposed. The first portrays God as forgiving and compassionate; the second highlights his retributive pun- ishment. Pursuing this description of God as both compassionate and vengeful, the rabbis posit a complex schema in which mercy and justice are combined in one divine figure possessed of two distinct attributes or measures - strict justice (din, which also connotes law, argument, logic, and punishment) and mercy (rahamim). As I have argued elsewhere, rab- binic thought is characterized by a tendency to think in terms of a "coin- cidence of opposites."24 Here, too, the rabbis conceived of justice and mercy as two polarities of a paradoxically unified divine whole. According to rabbinic thought, the various names of God appearing in scripture refer to these two attributes of God.25 Both attributes are com- bined in the ideal of divine adjudication - which human judges must emulate. Indeed, for the rabbis, these two divine attributes are all-encom- passing; virtually every aspect of existence is conceived around these two polarities. Sometimes these attributes are depicted in midrash as engaged in a struggle within God; at other times, the two attributes appear as almost fully independent beings at war with one another; at still other times, the attribute of strict justice is depicted as at war with God himself. These different literary representations of the two attributes in midrash also may reflect different conceptions of the precise relationship between justice and mercy.26 The struggle within God connotes an evenly balanced judgment that encompasses both qualities, whereas the struggle of justice against God himself portrays mercy as a nullification of justice. In seeking to accommodate the tension between justice and mercy by viewing both as interdependent attributes of a single divine figure, sever- al questions nonetheless persisted. Is the attribute of mercy an aspect of justice, or is it an act of divine grace outside the sphere of justice? If the latter, what triggers divine mercy? What are the emotional attitudes that make justice and mercy possible? Are the two attributes of God reflective of implicit role divisions, such as God the sovereign and God the creator? And, finally, can these two attributes be distinguished along gender lines? 145</page><page sequence="8">To answer these questions fully would require a detailed analysis of each strata of classical rabbinic thought, embodied in a variety of canon- ical works composed in different periods and places.27 But in focusing attention on the ideational preferences of the composers of the various documents of classical rabbinic Judaism, one sometimes misses the sub- tleties of discrete texts and narratives, which cite and transform earlier tra- ditions at the same time that they comment on their own historical situ- ation.28 Our midrash exemplifies this process. Our midrash is drawn from the rabbinic collection of commentaries on the biblical book of Lamentations.29 Its setting is the destruction of the Temple and the exile of Israel, events that this discrete midrashic collec- tion tends to view as punishments for Israel's sins. Although this midrash was composed well after the destruction of the Second Temple, the midrash is formally a comment on the destruction of the First Temple and the Babylonian exile, the subject of the biblical book of Lamentations, and which serves as a paradigm for all Jewish catastrophes in rabbinic thought. But while the biblical Lamentations is dominated by bitterness and despair, the rabbinic commentary on it emphasizes consolation and hope.30 The question occupying the narrator is whether God will restrain his anger and jealousy, temper justice with mercy, and forgive Israel. These questions are addressed through the imaginative construction of a heavenly trial in which various figures from Israel's past come before God to argue on her behalf. Our midrash should be read on three levels. The first level is as a dis- crete piece of religious literature. As such, the literary and religious genius of our midrash lies in its remarkable depiction of God. God is portrayed alternately as cold and unfeeling, jealous of meaningless idols, and in need of a lesson from humans in to how to conquer his jealous rage in order to show mercy toward the suffering Jews. Such ascriptions of human emo- tion to God (anthropopathism) and, in other midrashim, the ascription of human form to God (anthropomorphism) are common in midrash and may be startling to the modern reader who is accustomed to think- ing of the biblical God of monotheism as a transcendent, even bloodless, abstraction. Indeed, with the rise of systematic religious philosophy, this vivid depiction of God in human terms became not only an object of Christian ridicule but also a problem to be solved within rabbinic circles. One approach to solving the "problem" of midrash is worth high- 146</page><page sequence="9">lighting because of its relevance to contemporary debates about the autonomy of law. This approach was to create two distinct categories of rabbinic literature: binding, rational law (the halachah), and nonbinding midrashic literature, emotional, passionate, even fantastical. Yet, the two bodies of material are intermingled in the Talmud and the very the same rabbis who issue legal rulings compose midrash. Midrash itself proclaims: "If you wish to understand He who spoke and the World came to Be, study aggadah."''31 Thus, the midrashic depiction of God cannot be so eas- ily dismissed as solely a product of the literary imagination. Precisely for this reason, several scholars now contend that the anthropomorphic representation of God in midrash should be read liter- ally as reflective of the actual belief of various rabbinic schools.32 This is not the forum to adjudicate this issue except to note that the midrashic rabbis follow and intensify the literary portrayal of God in the Bible itself. "The God of the Bible is free from nature and fate, but he is not free from emotional tendencies," such as desire, love, and loyalty to prior obliga- tions.33 The literary tension in the midrashic depiction of God's personal- ity stems from the dual need to affirm both God's uniqueness and tran- scendence, on the one hand, and his ability to enter into a personal rela- tionship with humanity, on the other. This tension is played out in liter- ary terms to such an extent that at times God appears in midrash as two separate, contrasting "characters."34 The second level on which our midrash should be read is as an explo- ration of the normative ethical categories of justice and mercy as applied to God. This method of reading midrash as a metaphoric discussion of legal and moral concepts, traditionally common among scholars,35 was also adopted by medieval rabbinic commentators because it posed yet another solution to the problem of anthropomorphism. In this view, the midrashic depiction of God is treated as a problem of religious language. Just as the Bible spoke in the language of men, Hai Gaon wrote, the rab- bis also used human analogies and comparisons about God to instruct and teach abstract concepts, such as justice and mercy. The midrashic rab- bis themselves often use this very method in their own metaphoric inter- pretations of the anthropomorphic sections of the Bible. This method also allows midrash to emerge as the ethical and emotional expression, whether a foregrounding or subtle critique, of the more concrete halachah. 147</page><page sequence="10">The third level on which midrash should be read is the commentari- al. Our narrative, like most midrash, is first and foremost an interpreta- tion, or exegesis, of the Bible. An essential feature of midrashic interpre- tation is that each and every aspect of divine biblical language is purpo- sive and thus given for interpretation. Gaps, discontinuities, or contra- dictions in the biblical text, or grammatical peculiarities, all become "an occasion for recounting a narrative of their own invention or a peg on which to hang an extrabiblical legend or tradition."36 Names, in particu- lar, reflect aspects of a person's personality, often revealed through con- necting the name to other word cognates. In the midrashic imagination, these etymological connections and puns provide an important and fre- quent occasion for play.37 Another feature of midrashic interpretation is that all of scripture is a unity. Therefore, one scriptural phrase or passage can be interpreted through another scriptural phrase or passage, no mat- ter how seemingly unrelated in subject matter or remote in placement within the biblical text. The various scriptural texts and rabbinic traditions that are interwo- ven in the midrashic narrative are not always apparent on the surface of the midrash. Far more often, these earlier texts and traditions are alluded to, or otherwise condensed within, the narrative. The midrash assumes an audience that is so familiar with these texts and traditions that the allu- sions will be readily understood. The modern reader must work to uncov- er the presence of these traditions in the narrative not only to access the narrative's own meaning, but also to discover how the midrash has trans- formed the meaning of the earlier texts and traditions it cites. The commentarial aspect of our midrash is apparent in its form. Our midrash is a proem, a compositional form that begins with one scriptur- al passage and ends with a different, seemingly unrelated, scriptural pas- sage. Most probably, this compositional form originated as a sermon intended for use in the synagogue before the reading of the Torah. Unlike the typical midrashic genres, which begin with a prooftext and then pro- ceed to explicate the verse, the proem ends with its prooftext. This proof- text is ordinarily drawn from the weekly Torah reading. The verse with which the proem opens "is chosen for its apparent lack of connection to the concluding prooftext."38 The art of the proem is to reveal the connec- tions between the two passages through a chain of interpretations or com- mentarial ingenuity. This form affirms the essential unity of scripture. It 148</page><page sequence="11">also holds the audience's attention as the audience follows the chain of interpretation. B. Our Midrash in its Own Voice Our midrash begins with a verse from Isaiah and ends with verses from Jeremiah." Isaiah 22:12 states: "On that day did the Lord God of Hosts call for weeping and lamentation, tonsuring and girding with sack- cloth." The narrative explains this verse as referring to God watching Abraham and the angels cry over the destruction of the Temple. Abraham asks God why he has punished "Abraham's children" so severely and God answers that "your children" deserved this punishment. They violated the entire Torah and each of the twenty-two letters of the alphabet of which the Torah is composed. The narrative immediately dissolves into an elab- orate trial scene, with God as both judge and prosecutor calling witness- es to testify against Israel. The Torah, followed by each letter of the Hebrew alphabet is called up. Abraham, however, manages to persuade the Torah and the letters of the alphabet not to testify against Israel, by reminding each witness that Israel was the only nation willing to accept the Torah and, with it, various prescriptions beginning with the different letters of the alphabet. (Recall Abraham's role as defense lawyer in the bib- lical story of God's plan to destroy the cities of Sodom and Gemorrah.) Next, the three patriarchs and Moses appear to intercede on behalf of Israel. In accordance with the rabbinic conception that the meritorious deeds of the fathers can be balanced against Israel's sins, they point to var- ious meritorious acts that they performed in the past. Abraham reminds God of his willingness to sacrifice his only son Isaac in accordance with God's command. "I made myself into a cruel person and did not take pity upon him. Why then do you not remember this deed and take pity on my children?" Abraham asks God. Isaac reminds God of his role in the same incident. "When father told me that 'God will provide the lamb for the burnt offering - my son'(Genesis 22:8), I stretched my neck out toward the knife. Why then will you not remember this deed and take pity on my children?" Jacob reminds God of his willingness to sacrifice his life in place of his sons whom Esau sought to kill. "And now my chil- dren, who caused me so much grief and for whom I suffered the pain of raising children, are handed over to their enemies like sheep to the slaugh- 149</page><page sequence="12">terhouse. Why then do you not remember this deed and take pity on my children?" Finally, Moses reminds God that he was a "faithful shepherd" to Israel for forty years in the desert and nonetheless God decreed that he could not enter the land of Israel. Throughout this portion of the narra- tive, God is unresponsive, even absent. Moses then turns to Jeremiah and says: "I will gather them back." But the Babylonian exiles' hope of redemption, which is raised at the sight of Moses (who, having redeemed Israel out of Egypt, is a common liberator figure in midrash),4? is dashed by a heavenly voice that proclaims: "This exile is a decree from me!" Moses acknowledges that he cannot bring the Jews back, but assures them that redemption will shortly come. He leaves the weeping Jews, and returns to the patriarchs, who ask Moses what the enemy has done to their children. Moses provides a graphic picture of the fate of Israel in the hands of their captors, and beseeches the Chaldean (Babylonian) captors even if they kill, not to murder cruelly. "Do not slay a son in his father's presence, or a daughter in her mother's." The captors ignore Moses and this section ends with the murder of a child before its mother and the mother's tears and lamentation.41 At this point, Moses turns to God and levels a clever legal argument against him. Moses asks God how he can countenance the slaughtering of Jewish children together with their mothers when God himself, in the Torah, forbade Jews to kill an ox or a lamb in the same day as their off- spring. God still does not respond. Finally, the matriarch Rachel pleads on Israel's behalf. She does not present a legal argument at first, nor does she ask that her deeds be remembered and recompensed in this time of judgment. Instead, she begins with a story: the story of how she conquered her jealousy. In the biblical account, Jacob worked seven years for Laban, tending sheep, in order to marry Laban's younger daughter Rachel. But on the wedding night, Laban tricked Jacob into marrying his elder daughter Leah by cov- ering Leah with the wedding veil. According to the midrash, Jacob was suspicious of Laban from the outset and so he gave Rachel various signs to use on the wedding night so that Jacob would know that his veiled bride was, indeed, Rachel. Rachel, however, could not bear to see her sis- ter disgraced and shamed and so, out of pity, she conquered her jealousy and shared the signs with Leah. Indeed, she tells that she even hid under the bed and answered for her sister so that Jacob would not recognize 150</page><page sequence="13">Leah's voice. Rachel then turns to God and invokes a logical argument: And if I, who am flesh and blood, dust and ashes, was not jealous of my co-wife and did not permit her to be shamed and humiliated then you, Oh living King, why are you jealous of idols that have no reality, and why have You exiled my children and allowed them to be killed by the sword and permitted their enemies to do as they wished with them? "Immediately," the narrative recites, "God's pity was stirred" and he agreed for the sake of Rachel to restore Israel to their place. This, the nar- rative concludes, is the sense of the verses of Jeremiah 31:14-17: "Thus says the Lord; A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping - Rachel weeping for her children. She refuses to be comforted for her children who are gone. Thus says the Lord; Keep your voice from weep- ing, and your eyes from tears; for your work shall be rewarded. And there is hope for your future, says the Lord: Your children shall come back again from the land of the enemy." C. Reading Midrash as Literature, Law, and Cultural History The literary drama at the center of our midrash is the gradual unfold- ing of the full personality of God. The story began with the description of an impartial and indifferent sovereign who exacts retribution for viola- tion of the legal regimentation of the Torah. The angels and the patriarchs weep, but God is uninvolved. The suffering Jews are the children of the patriarchs; God has no relationship with them. This is a God possessed of an abstract will and free of emotional tendencies, who judges man literal- ly by the book and in accordance with the letter of the law - represent- ed here by the prosecution witnesses of the book of Torah law, and each letter of the alphabet contained within it. By the end of our midrash, however, God has been transformed from a force into a person "whose pity is stirred" - a God who can add the emotional traits of "compas- sion, care, concern, nurturance, identification, and sympath[y]" to the process of judging.42 The transformation of God from an impersonal, affectless, and unre- lenting - almost ministerial - judicial figure to a judge who is capable 151</page><page sequence="14">of empathy for the defendant is effected within our midrash through human persuasion and argument. But the reader can scarcely help won- dering why the pleas of the patriarchs and Moses fail to move God to mit- igate the punishment. Why does the narrator designate Rachel as the sole cause of divine transformation in this episode? Later I will suggest other answers to that question, which revolve around the midrashic view of Rachel as a character and the implicit gender coding that may be con- tained in this and other rabbinic narratives. Here, I would like to focus on the normative concerns, commentarial ingenuities, and literary aspects of our midrash, using each to illuminate the others. 1. Our Midrash's Conception of Divine Justice and Mercy Several scholars have read this midrash as a substantive comment on divine justice. But they ascribe the midrash to a "bold author" who is will- ing to portray the destruction and exile, not as a just punishment for Israel's sins, but, rather, as meaningless suffering caused by God's "arbi- trary" decree or his petty jealousy of idols that have no reality.4 Precisely the opposite is the case, however. The narrative is a conservative explica- tion of the concepts of divine justice and mercy, dependent on normative texts and traditions. Moreover, the narrative is far less concerned with divine justice and far more concerned with identifying what triggers divine mercy, delineating its quality and the emotional attitudes that underlie it. Looked at from this perspective, the narrative calls the reader to work through the various attempts to persuade God to alter his judg- ment and try to understand why only Rachel prevails. Through identifi- cation with the arguments of each protagonist in turn, those rejected and that accepted, the audience comes to understand the basis for the divine decree and for its eventual mitigation. Moses has presented an unexpected argument for mitigation of the punishment. Moses begins by describing the fate of the Jews in poignant and explicit terms. They are bound and stripped, fettered in irons, and children are slaughtered together with their mothers. But, surprisingly, this imagery is not followed by an appeal from Moses for pity for the afflicted, suffering Jews. Instead, Moses lodges a legal complaint against God, a common midrashic argument that is based on the view that God, too, is bound by the law. God's treatment of Israel violates the law God 152</page><page sequence="15">himself authorized. God ruled in the Torah that one may not slaughter animals together with their mothers. How then can he permit such slaughtering of Israel? In other words, God's punishment is illegal. Although there is a subtle critique of God's justice here, the focus of the midrash is on the failure of Moses to present a proper ground for mercy. Instead, Moses has limited himself to rational arguments based on analo- gy and the need for consistency with prior norms. The second argument presented at the trial is based on the rabbinic doctrine of imputed merits. The patriarchs ask God to take account of both their own individual meritorious deeds as well as Israel's prior meri- torious deed (her initial acceptance of the Torah, unlike the other nations who rejected it) in assessing the degree of punishment appropriate for Israel's current sins. Is this a strictly legal argument, rooted in just deserts, or is this a request for an act of divine compassion or grace? The doctrine of the merits of the fathers, like its counterpart the biblical idea of delayed punishment, is in tension with other biblical and rabbinic traditions that assert that God punishes each individual in accordance with his sins, "measure for measure." According to the latter vision of divine justice and human responsibility, every act elicits an appropriate response from God that exactly parallels the gravity of the act. In his magisterial treatment of this subject, Yohanan Muffs argues that the doctrines of delayed punishment and the merits of the fathers serve to mediate between the demands of strict justice, on the one hand, and mercy, on the other.44 Muffs posits three conceptual models of sin and punishment. In the first, sin has an objective quality that inexorably brings about retributive punishment, which cannot be delayed or miti- gated on account of the merits of the fathers. In the third, sin has a sub- jective quality which can be cured or canceled through reform or repen- tance. In this model, mercy is bestowed upon a repentant who, viewed in his or her moral entirety, deserves it. In the second model, "[t]he attribute of strict justice makes its demands and the attribute of mercy makes its demands."45 Justice requires that punishment ensue while mercy urges the cancellation of punishment because the sinner has repented. The tension can be accommodated by delaying or mitigating the punishment. The imputed merits of the fathers, in this view, is a "personification of an ideal" - the ideal of mercy.46 Israel is punished, but that punishment is mitigated or delayed on account of the good deeds of prior generations, 153</page><page sequence="16">who may store up their merits for future use. As the Mishnah states, the patriarchs have the duty to stand before God as defense counsel because they have the power to transform the divine attribute of justice into the attribute of mercy.47 This understanding of the patriarchs' appeal to God, however, shat- ters the narrative's structure as I have reconstructed it. Again, the reader is left wondering why the patriarch's appeal for mercy is rejected. Possibly our narrative assumes that the doctrine of the merits of the fathers is not an aspect of the attribute of mercy but, rather, an aspect of just deserts when punishment is visited not on a single individual but, rather, as in this midrash, on the collective of Israel." From the collective perspective, all the generations are interwoven and thus the merits of the fathers, whose good deeds deserve full recompense, must be weighed in the bal- ance when assessing the sins of later generations, just as the merits of chil- dren also may be imputed to previous generations. The concept of mer- its, whether of the past or of the future, is thus a claim made by the col- lective on God. "It is a political demand" on the sovereign to fulfill prior promises based on the notion of corporate justice,"4 a demand that can succeed only if the merits of the collective outweigh its sins. There is yet another decisive factor that explains why the appeal to the imputed merits of the fathers is rejected in our narrative as an ade- quate ground for mitigating the divine decree. The doctrine of the merits of the fathers, like the doctrine of delayed punishment, has an extremely equivocal position in rabbinic thought.50 The tannaim in particular were wary of this concept, which was popular among the masses, fearing that it might undermine the sense of the obligation to fulfill the command- ments in the present and to take responsibility for one's own actions.51 Accordingly, they often cautioned that those who violate the Torah can find no solace in the merits of the fathers. Other stresses on the doctrine emanated from outside the tradition. A common polemic against the Jews centered on why the merits of the fathers did not aid them in their cur- rent time of need. And when Christianity placed at the center of its sys- tem the concept of vicarious atonement, rabbinic concerns about the doc- trine no doubt were heightened.5 At some point after the ascendance of Christianity, rabbinic literature began to assert with more frequency that the merits of the fathers functioned as a basis for divine mercy up to a par- ticular point in Israel's history, but was no longer relevant to the present."53 154</page><page sequence="17">Indeed, both Lamentations Rabbah, the midrashic collection of which our midrash is a part, and Rabbi Samuel ben Nachman, to whom our midrash is attributed, are generally opposed to this doctrine.54 Significantly, the very chapter of Jeremiah from which the conclud- ing verses of our midrash are taken, is itself an indictment of vicarious atonement and delayed punishment. Jeremiah cites but rejects the well- known older proverb about the fathers who eat sour grapes and whose children's teeth are then set on edge. Instead, Jeremiah offers a different conception of justice and mercy, proclaiming that "everyone shall be put to death for his own transgression." (Jer. 31:28-29). Once our midrash is read in tandem with the prophetic tradition of Jeremiah that was origi- nally attached to the verses actually cited in our midrash, it becomes clear that our midrash rejects the merits of the fathers as a legitimate basis for challenging the justness of the divine decree. Instead, our midrash offers an alternative conception of what the attribute of divine mercy implies and embeds this conception within the argument about jealousy and love presented by the matriarch Rachel. Indeed, the literary symbolism within our midrash and the prophet- ic traditions of Jeremiah alluded to in the narrative all along have provid- ed important clues to the reader, not only that the focus of the midrash centers on the definition of divine mercy, but that Rachel will be the suc- cessful protagonist in eliciting such mercy. Interweaved throughout the midrash is a single metaphor, that of the ewe lamb and the shepherd, a common biblical motif.55 In our midrash, Israel is portrayed as a lamb led to slaughter and Moses as its shepherd. Moses' argument to God also analogizes Israel's punishment to the laws concerning the slaughtering of lambs. Both Abraham and Isaac recall the aborted sacrifice of Isaac, replaced by the sacrifice of the ram. Most importantly, the Hebrew word Rachel is not only the name of a person, here the biblical matriarch, but also the word for ewe or lamb, a pun the rabbis elsewhere make explicit.56 The lamb is a symbol for God's trait of mercy (recall the biblical paschal lamb whose blood averted God's slaughter of the Israelites) - a symbol borrowed by Christianity from Jewish sources. And, indeed, a ewe is also referred to as a rachmin, from the Hebrew word for mercy. This repeated literary symbolism orients the listener both to the central dilemma of the midrash - the need to locate the source and nature of divine mercy - and to its eventual resolution through the character of Rachel. 155</page><page sequence="18">The prophetic traditions of Jeremiah in fact provide the basic frame- work for our midrash in its entirety. It is from Jeremiah 11:19 that the image of a "lamb led to slaughter" is taken. More importantly, a central concern of the prophecy of Jeremiah cited in our midrash is to delineate a new conception of the nature of justice and mercy for the post-exilic period.57 Jeremiah himself frames this prophecy around the figure of Rachel. Jeremiah came from the land of the tribe of Benjamin, one of the two sons of Rachel. Jeremiah preached from before the Babylonian siege until some time after the fall of Jerusalem and, in the chapter from which our midrash's concluding citation is taken, Jeremiah addresses Ephraim, the house of Northern Israel that had been defeated and exiled in an ear- lier period. Ephraim was the son of Joseph, Rachel's other child. Thus, Jeremiah's prophecy here centers on Rachel, the ancestress of Northern Israel, who is heard weeping bitterly for her children in Ramah. Ramah is the place of Rachel's tomb but it also means, literally, "on high," giving rise to our midrashic siting of Rachel crying on high - that is, in heav- en. Jeremiah tells Rachel to stop crying because God, Jeremiah asserts, will be moved to pity and will have mercy on "his darling child Ephraim" (Jeremiah 31:20). Thus, what in the original context of Jeremiah is a prophecy of God's eventual mercy, intended to reassure Rachel as a figure for Northern Israel, becomes transformed in our midrash into an etiolo- gy of how God "learned" to be merciful from Rachel, as a figure for a per- son involved in the emotional complexities of jealousy and love within an interpersonal relationship. Yet, despite its complete transformation of Jeremiah's literary images, our midrash remains faithful to Jeremiah's sub- stantive message, adopting his theology. Although this process can be seen elsewhere in midrash, it may be reinforced here by the fact that the rab- binic tradition assigns the authorship of Lamentations, on which our midrash is a comment, to Jeremiah." The bridge between the treatment of Rachel in Jeremiah and her treatment in our midrash is provided by the designated author of our very midrash, Rabbi Shmuel ben Nachman, in an altogether different midrash found in another midrashic collection. Commenting on the words in Genesis, "and was barren (akara)," which the rabbis repunctuate as: "Rachel was the principal character (ikara)," Rabbi Shmuel ben Nachman explains Rachel's paramountcy in terms of the verses in Jeremiah. Israel is called after Rachel because she cries, or pleads, on behalf of her children.59 This thematic is pursued elsewhere in 156</page><page sequence="19">midrashic literature which asks why Rachel is buried on the road to Ephrat, on the outskirts of Jerusalem, and turns to the verses of Jeremiah for the solution. Jacob saw that in the future the exiled nation would pass by her burial site. Accordingly, Jacob buried her in that spot so that Rachel would ask God for mercy for her exiled children and God would respond with mercy.6 From our narrator's perspective, then, it is fitting that Rachel's argu- ment to God should evoke the attribute of mercy. But what precisely does divine mercy entail in our midrash? Rachel shows God what mercy entails by recalling how she restrained her jealousy out of love of her sister. Mercy is thus conceived as an activ- ity, rather than an attitude - the restraint of jealousy activated by love, within the context of a pre-existing personal relationship. In the view of our midrash, then, mercy is not an aspect of a complex form of judgment that encompasses both attributes; rather, mercy is outside the sphere of justice. It is an act of nullification of the divine decree that is undeserved, and made possible solely because of a prior love relationship in which the actors are embedded. This conception of mercy as an act of love rather than an aspect of justice is represented elsewhere in midrashic thought, most notably by the idea that God's keeping of his covenantal promises is not a duty owed to Israel or a right of Israel arising from a contractual relationship. Rather, God's keeping of his promises is dependent on a divine act of self-restraint and, as such, an expression of the attribute of mercy latent in God's power.61 The "moral intuition"62 that jealousy and love within the context of a personal relationship are the emotional manifestations of the normative categories of justice and mercy is a "deep structure," or paradigmatic fea- ture, of rabbinic thought that both continues and transforms the biblical model. In their study of the sin of idolatry, Halbertal and Margalit note that the meaning of idolatry in the Bible is "anchored on all levels in the analysis of marital relations, betrayal, and jealousy."''63 Idolatry is depicted as adulterous betrayal, the worship of strange gods. The God of Israel is a jealous God who demands loyalty and honor from Israel, just as a hus- band demands it of his wife. The metaphoric representation of idolatry in the Bible as betrayal of the husband is dependent on certain "attitudes toward the family and societal obligations" that justify public forms of retribution and restitution, including death." 157</page><page sequence="20">The biblical conception of jealousy and honor, Halbertal and Margalit argue, became transformed in classical rabbinic culture. "As a result of this conceptual transformation God is seen as possessing dignity rather than honor, and God's honor becomes associated primarily with his ability to restrain himself, rather than with his ability to demand restitu- tion when he has been insulted."''65 Our midrash, Halbertal and Margalit point out, is exemplary of this changed attitude toward jealousy and honor in social relations. God's ability to curb his "destructive jealousy" and replace it with "restraint and generosity" still is represented metaphorically through images of marital relations.66 But now God is rep- resented as a female, a wife, who is able to conquer jealousy of her co-wife, the idol, within the context of a pre-existing, loving relationship. In a society that emphasizes dignity rather than honor and the pre- eminence of loving rather than loyalty relationships, the notion of restraint and the substitution of love for jealousy serves as a filter through which a variety of norms, including the ethical norms of justice and mercy, is perceived. Justice is no longer perceived as vengeance for betray- al but as a more abstract idea pursuant to which punishment is measured out in accordance with the gravity of the act performed, while mercy is perceived as a nullification or mitigation of justice and the keeping of covenantal promises based on the priority of loving relationships. One can only speculate whether this later conception is also driven by a more acute sense of the gravity of Israel's offense that developed with the pas- sage of so much time from the initial catastrophic destruction of the Second Temple. Unlike the first destruction, where return and rebuilding followed almost immediately, the second destruction lingered on without solace. On the contrary, Israel was beset by the thought, generated both internally and by its external rivals, that God had finally abandoned the Jews for good reason and no longer cared for them. By the time of our midrash, reconciliation and return is now thought to depend on a special and immense act of divine mercy, grace, or love - despite the fact that the covenantal promise itself guaranteed the eventual end of exile. This mood is captured in our midrash, which dwells on God's absence and unresponsiveness throughout the lengthy and numerous appeals by the human protagonists to mitigate his decree. The promise of redemption finally comes when least expected, through the surprising appearance of Rachel. 158</page><page sequence="21">2. The Gender of Justice and Mercy Our midrash presents the tension between justice and mercy, or abstract principle and emotional love, in terms of gender imagery. The full realization of the qualities of strict justice and mercy, the two attrib- utes of God, is achieved in our midrash through a clear-cut division of roles between the male and female protagonists. The male protagonists question the justness of the divine decree through logical argument or an appeal to established doctrinal grounds for mitigating punishment. Rachel, by contrast, invokes the divine attribute of mercy by embodying the emotional manifestations of this normative category. Moreover, by analogy and extension, God, as dispenser of mercy, is represented as fem- inine, a wife in a polygamous relationship. Although there are few images of God as female in the Bible, the rabbis apparently were more willing to portray God in terms of female imagery. One of the names of God in rab- binic literature is shekhina, which is grammatically female. The use of this name for God seems to connote the close presence of God and it is this "intimacy" that may give God a feminine "attribute."''67 In the midrashic literature, the Torah is also personified by means of female metaphors, as is Israel, when depicted in her relationship to God. Nonetheless, it is rare to encounter the female personification of God in specific relationship to Israel as male. In our narrative, Israel occupies the male position, while God is the wife. This is in marked contrast to the biblical marriage metaphors, in which God is always the husband. Is Rachel then a figure in rabbinic thought for a feminine attribute of God as dispenser of mercy, or is Rachel a figure for humanity, the "other" to the masculine deity, on whom God's conduct in this narrative is mod- eled? And, in either case, is the narrative choice of Rachel, the co-wife, to give voice to the quality of mercy and its emotional manifestation, the substitution of love for jealousy, a reflection of rabbinic assumptions about feminine characteristics or roles? The medieval kabbalistic literature provides one answer to these ques- tions. In the kabbalistic literature, Rachel stands for the feminine presence of God and is equated with the "shekhina in exile." The shekhina is no longer a name of God but a feminine aspect of the divinity. The idea of the shekhina in exile condenses two images: the identification of Rachel with the exiled community for which she cries, and the identification of 159</page><page sequence="22">God with the exile, symbolized by the withdrawal and exile of the shekhi- na once the Temple was destroyed. Although some of these ideas may be prefigured in our text, it is important not to retroject kabbalistic gender imagery, in which the role of the feminine is intensified and yet at the same time given more negative connotations, onto the earlier midrashic literature.68 These issues are briefly treated by David Stern who rejects the idea that God's yielding to Rachel's plea in our midrash testifies to the "emer- gence of a feminine presence within God himself," or a feminine soften- ing of "[h]is masculine hardness" as he submits to the "compassionate softness of the matriarch's plea." The very opposite, he asserts, is the case. "Rachel's femininity does possess a symbolic meaning: it epitomizes humanity, while God's utter masculinity is the sign of divinity." God does not become feminine merely because he is persuaded by a female. "Rather, in an ironic reversal of imitatio dei that we might call imitatio hominis, it is the model of human behavior to which God now turns in submitting to Rachel's example."''69 Thus, for Stern, Rachel functions as a generic human model of mercy who transcends gender.70 A preference for analogies drawn from human relationships, "homey metaphors and anthropomorphic analogies," also explains why, in a later period in Christian thought, one finds increasing usages of maternal imagery to describe Jesus.7' But, as Caroline Bynum points out, "it also reflects the fact that what medieval authors assumed the female to be coincided with what they increasingly wished to emphasize about God the creator and about the Incarnation."72 In addition to wishing to stress God as loving and accessible, these medieval writers wished to soften the authority and rule of God "with that for which the maternal stood: emo- tion and nurture."73 Thus, one must still ask whether the qualities that the rabbis wished to emphasize about God in this particular midrash, his abil- ity to restrain his jealous anger, coincided with what they assumed to be identifiable feminine characteristics - even if they are also feminine aspects of men. For, "the female (or woman) and the feminine are not the same. The former is a person of one gender; the latter may be an aspect of a person of either gender."74 In attempting to assess the significance of the gender imagery in our narrative, one must proceed cautiously, however, because numerous fac- tors influence the narrative choice of Rachel to give voice to the divine 160</page><page sequence="23">attribute of mercy, and, by extension, to portray God as occupying the female role. These include a consistent view of Rachel's character drawn both from her biblical portrayal and other midrashic traditions; wordplay; local exegetical needs; ideas about how females act or should act either because of their nature or social situation; or possibly a pre-existent tradi- tion about the divine attribute of mercy as feminine. For example, the association of Rachel with the quality of mercy is, on one level, a product of wordplay: the equation of rachel with ewe lamb and lamb with mercy. On another level, it is the product of local exegesis. First, as noted, our midrash is implicitly commenting on Jeremiah, who assures Rachel that her weeping will be remembered when God shows mercy to her children, and on related traditions stemming from Jeremiah that transform Rachel into a feminine figure of mercy. Second, the suffering of the collective Israel is personified in the biblical Lamentations as a woman in distress and a mother whose child is slaughtered. Symmetry is maintained in the midrashic comment on Lamentations by placing the source of consola- tion in the voice of a woman. God, too, is possibly made to occupy the female role in response to local exegetical needs. The feminine represen- tation of God in the context of our midrash "makes the sin of idolatry less severe" because it is equated with the addition of a co-wife, which is legal- ly permitted, "in contrast to the representation of idolatry as the wife's betrayal of the husband, which is a sin punishable by death."75 But these examples do not exhaust the condensation of traditions and of ideology that is occurring in our midrash. I would like to explore a few more of these traditions and ideas in a tentative fashion in the hope that it will stimulate further discussion of the place of the feminine in rabbinic thought. a. Rachel, Mercy, and the Co-Wife. A cursory glance at the biblical stories about Rachel reveals that all the elements found in our midrash are already present in the biblical text.76 The stories about Rachel revolve around the themes of jealousy, love, and substitution. Laban substitutes Leah for Rachel as Jacob's bride. Rachel is Jacob's beloved and Leah, Jacob's co-wife, is jealous of that love. In turn, as the biblical text explicitly states, Rachel is jealous of Leah because the latter bore Jacob sons and Rachel is barren. Leah views her sons as substi- 161</page><page sequence="24">tutes for Jacob's love and gives them names to reflect that reality. Rachel, in turn, substitutes a night of Jacob's love for mandrakes that Leah's son gathered. Jacob tells Rachel that she is substituting him for God when she asks him to provide her with children. Rachel also, it should be noted, is involved with idols. She steals Laban's idols and takes them with her. Elsewhere, the midrash explains that Rachel recognized that the idols were meaningless entities but sought to save Laban from sin.7 This constellation of jealousy, love, and substitution is given a differ- ent emphasis in a variety of midrashic traditions about Rachel and Leah. They stress the women's capacity to substitute love for initial jealousy, a theme that is absent in the biblical text. Rachel conquers her jealousy of Leah out of love for her sister when she gives Leah the signs that enable her sister to marry Jacob. Leah, in turn, conquers her jealousy of Rachel and prays that her sister will bear a child. In a marvelous example of midrashic wordplay sensitively dissected by Geoffrey Hartman, the midrash parses the words of two biblical verses according to their visual and auditory sense in order both to connect them and fill in gaps in the text. The first verse relates that "after, Leah had a daughter that she named Dinah." The second verse relates that God remembered (va-yizkor, a word that also can be read as "to make male") Rachel and listened to her (ei- lehah, which can also be heard as "to Leah") and opened Rachel's womb (rachmah, a word also connoting mercy).7" The midrash explains the gap in the text suggested by the word "after" as follows: After Leah realized that she was pregnant again, she prayed that her child would not be a son, so that Rachel would be able to bring forth as many tribes as had the handmaidens. God then substituted Leah's male fetus for a female fetus, named Dinah, her judgment. Why? Because Leah stood before God seek- ing a judgment and so God said to her: You are a merciful person, and so I will be merciful to her. God listened to jealous Leah's loving prayers for Rachel, and switched the fetus, and also, as other midrashim pursue, remembered jealous Rachel's loving act toward her sister, and gave Rachel a son.79 Our midrash condenses this dynamic by placing Rachel, the co-wife, at the center of God's substitution of his jealousy with love. Just as Rachel substituted her jealousy of her co-wife with love for her abandoned sister, God substitutes his jealousy of idols (which Rachel points out are mean- ingless) with love for the abandoned Israel. The midrashic reworking of 162</page><page sequence="25">the biblical themes turns jealousy into a positive force. It emphasizes that jealousy is a product of the intimacy of the family relationship that exists between Rachel and Leah, and by extension, between God and Israel. Because this relationship is also suffused with love, jealousy can be over- come. Moreover, in our midrash the emotional dynamic that constitutes the attribute of mercy, the ability to substitute love for jealousy, is shared by both God and humanity. This assumption should be compared to the biblical treatment of this theme, which emphasizes that what distinguish- es divinity from humanity is the former's ability to conquer jealousy. In Hosea, God explains that he can conquer his anger and forgive Israel's betrayal "[f]or I am God, not man." (Hosea 11:9). The differences in the biblical and midrashic treatment of this issue, the first implying that man cannot conquer anger and jealousy, and the second, illustrating how Rachel and Leah, women, are capable of this emotional transformation, raises the question whether the ability to conquer jealousy and replace it with love is in fact viewed in the rabbinic schema as a distinctly feminine characteristic. I would like to speculate for a moment as to why this emotional capacity may have been associated particularly with females within the matrix of rabbinic culture. Rabbinic society, unlike biblical society, although permitting polygyny, was by and large monogamous. Thus the particular emotional capacity of the co-wives highlighted in these various narratives would seem to have little connection to marital relationships prevalent in rabbinic culture. In this sense, the metaphor used to describe the relationship of God to Israel in our narrative rests on superseded forms of personal relationships and emotional trials. Yet, rabbinic society did perpetuate a particular triangular relationship within the marital domain that must have created emotional trials similar to that experi- enced by the co-wives. As Daniel Boyarin rightly points out, "[t]he absolute and contradic- tory demands of marriage and commitment to study of Torah remained one of the great unresolved tensions of rabbinic culture."'o On the one hand, the law commands that men must marry in order to have children. On the other hand, life-long devotion to Torah study was perceived as not only obligatory but erotic. The Torah, the law - which is invariably imaged as female - was a "jealous mistress," or, in Boyarin's words, "the 163</page><page sequence="26">other woman."'' Indeed, the Babylonian Talmud relates that rabbinic scholars often married early and then left home for extended periods of study, leaving their wives to raise their family without them. This triangle of rabbi, Torah, and wife can be analogized to the social institution of polygyny. If so, the perception that the emotional trait of substituting love for jealousy was a distinctly feminine capacity stemmed not solely from rabbinic reflection on the biblical matriarchs' lives; it also rested on per- sonal observation, as wives restrained their jealousy of the husband's more figurative co-wife out of their own love for the Torah. The talmudic paradigm for this form of marriage is that between Rabbi Akiva and his wife, whom the tradition universally identifies as Rachel. And, as Boyarin also points out, there are significant parallels between the midrashic story of Rabbi Akiva's marriage and that of the bib- lical Jacob and Rachel.82 Our midrash about Rachel restraining her jeal- ousy out of love for her co-wife is thus part and parcel of the theme Boyarin is developing and partly accounts for the midrashic emphasis on the co-wives ability to substitute love for jealousy, an emphasis not found in the biblical text. In this way, the midrash works to transmit cultural val- ues at the same time that it preserves and condenses pre-existing traditions. 2. Rachel, Mercy, and Maternal Love Although our midrash focuses explicitly on the emotional aspects of mercy in terms of jealousy and love, an undercurrent in the narrative places mercy within a different, although complementary, emotional con- text: the love that a parent feels for a child, which enables the parent to mitigate the harshness of rules and discipline. Our midrash begins with a depiction of God as sovereign ruler, uninvolved in any family relationship with Israel. The Jews are "your children," God says to Abraham. But at the midrash's conclusion, through citation to the verses in Jeremiah, God's mercy is also analogized to that of a parent. The narrative choice of Rachel to give rise to the attribute of mercy highlights this aspect of the quality of mercy because there is a pre-existent and stable conception of Rachel herself as a maternal figure of mercy. Although Genesis does not allude to this aspect of Rachel, in Jeremiah and consequently elsewhere in midrash, as noted above, Rachel possesses a distinctive "voice." She is the mother who weeps for mercy for her children, Israel, and at whose tomb obser- 164</page><page sequence="27">vant Jews pray to this day for merciful intercession with the divine. Does our midrash also condense a pre-existent and stable rabbinic tradition that associates the divine attribute of mercy with the feminine quality of maternal love? Scholars have long sought to find a consistent conception of the two attributes along gender lines in classical rabbinic thought, with strict justice masculinized and mercy feminized. Although such a conception exists in the later kabbalah and is indirectly alluded to in Philo, the evidence for such a view within midrashic circles is sugges- tive, at best.83 But even if the midrashic sources do not attest directly to a gendered conception of justice and mercy, the two attributes of God do seem strongly linked to role divisions that we moderns, at least, have come to associate with traditional gender constructions. The midrashic depiction of mercy and justice seems to correspond to the two basic roles of God, creator or parent, on the one hand, and sovereign ruler or royal figure, on the other. These two divine roles correspond to the two relationships humanity has with God: a parent-child relationship epitomized by love, and a master-servant relationship epitomized by fear and reverence. As our midrash suggests, the quality of strict justice is equated in midrashic thought with the biblical description of God as a "jealous God," in the sense of an exclusive sovereign who does not permit the worship of other gods and judges such transgressions harshly.84 The midrashic equa- tion of mercy with the biblical description of God as creator-parent is a commonplace. Commenting on the obvious question raised by Genesis 1:26, "And God said: Let us make man...", the midrash cites two opinions that seek to identify the plural "us" with whom God consulted. According to the first opinion, God foresaw that wicked and righteous people would follow from Adam. Therefore, God joined with the attribute of mercy in order to create man. The second opinion actually elucidates the first. According to the second opinion, God reveals to the angels that righteous people will descend from Adam but hides the fact that wicked people will also be born. Why? Because had he known, the attribute of justice would not have allowed Adam to be created.85 The attribute of mercy and the cre- ative-parental role of God are interdependent. Again, the midrashists were simply extrapolating from ideas latent in scripture. As noted, in depicting the gravity of Israel's sins and the right- eous anger of God, the prophets employed the metaphor of God, the jeal- 165</page><page sequence="28">ous, sovereign, husband, betrayed by his bride, Israel, the idolatrous-adul- terer. This metaphor made forgiveness problematic because biblical law forbids a husband to take back an adulterous wife. Jeremiah notes the problem (3:1) and solves it by substituting a different metaphor of fami- ly relationships. Israel can be forgiven because God is also the parent who shows mercy and Israel is his child. (3:19-22).86 The question left unanswered is whether the rabbis viewed this role division explicitly along gender lines. Apart from our midrash, the evi- dence is in fact slight. The sovereign ruler God, the attribute of justice, is invariably associated with the masculine. The creator-parental God, the attribute of mercy, however, is only on occasion explicitly associated with the feminine. In a few places, the Bible does refer to God as a woman who conceives, carries, and suckles. The word rahamim, mercy, is etymologi- cally related to the word rehem, womb, and various cognates of the latter are used to connote the maternal instinct. This linguistic relationship reinforces the connection between the idea of God as creator and the attribute of mercy. But the linguistic connection does not necessarily con- note that the aspect of mercy is in itself viewed as feminine nurture. Rather, as we saw before, the opening of the womb by God is viewed as an act of mercy. Mercy, when conceived in terms of the emotional dynamic of a parental relationship, is apparently viewed as a characteris- tic that is shared by the two sexes. In the rabbinic wordview, paternal and maternal affection is equated. The image of God as a loving father is both common and eminently understandable. 3. The Gender of Human Mercy and Stereotyping in Rabbinic Culture. So far, we have seen that God's quality of mercy, when viewed from the perspective of parental affectivity, is not identified as a particularly feminine trait. On the other hand, the ability to conquer love and replace it with jealousy does seem to be expressed as a feminine characteristic. But the strongest evidence that mercy in the rabbinic schema has a feminine association comes from rabbinic statements scattered throughout the Talmud that identify certain human characteristics as stereotypically female. It is the nature of women to be compassionate, the Talmud asserts, implying in this context that they are by nature more merciful 166</page><page sequence="29">than men.87 Chastity or modesty also was seen as a special female virtue. Yet, elsewhere the Talmud states that compassion and chastity are the spe- cial virtue of the entire nation of Israel."8 These statements testify to a blurring of gender traits, concomitant with the rabbinic willingness to use gender imagery in a relatively fluid fashion. One reason for this blurring of gender traits, no doubt, hinges on the concept of imitatio dei, a concept prevalent in rabbinic thought. As God embodied both justice and mercy already in his biblical portrayal, man who was created in his image also was to act justly and mercifully, even if the latter is associated with the feminine. In fact, there is an almost per- fect confluence between the activity of the rabbis and their midrashic por- trayal of God's actions. In midrash, God studies Torah like the rabbis and puts on phylacteries. Furthermore, once a quality is seen as a religious or ethical virtue, it must be embodied in both sexes. At the same time, the fact that mercy is seen to be one of the essen- tial defining features of the community of Israel testifies to the centrality of this moral ideal in rabbinic thought. Did the rabbis view the two genders then as essentially the same or, at least, complementary, rather than one the opposite of the other? Rabbinic traditions about the androgynous nature of the first human cre- ation also would seem to support the idea that men and women were not marked as a contrasting pair. And, yet, while the genders do not seem to be dichotomous in rabbinic thought, there is an asymmetry in the treat- ment of the genders in one important respect. Traditional male charac- teristics such as judgment, reason, logic, rule, and discipline were, to my knowledge, not imputed to females nor described through feminine imagery in the classical rabbinic period. Although God's intimacy and mercy may give God a feminine attribute, God's transcendence and sov- ereignty are not portrayed through the use of feminine imagery. On the contrary, there are more than a few rabbinic statements alluding to women's frivolity and lack of seriousness, disqualifying them from the dis- cipline of legal study. What we do see here then is the sharing of what the rabbis themselves labeled as quintessentially feminine characteristics by men. But some of the traits most valued in rabbinic society, the capacity for legal reasoning and judging, are exclusively male. Thus while there is not a strong sense of males and females as binary opposites in classical rabbinic thought, the rabbis did associate specific 167</page><page sequence="30">personality characteristics or roles with one or the other sex. Were these differences in personality and role viewed as fixed, essential characteristics or as culturally conditioned, necessitated by the need to accomplish larg- er religious goals, including ensuring procreation, a religious obligation, and creating a system of support for Torah study? Put otherwise, is gen- der stereotyping and gender imagery in the midrash the product of rab- binic views about the essentially different nature of women and men or is it motivated by the need to define and mold their behavior in different arenas in order to accomplish larger ends? These are sensitive questions because legal norms may revolve around rabbinic statements that are treated as normative assumptions about human nature, including the essential differences between the genders. The question whether the behavioral assumptions that ground vari- ous legal norms or influence gender imagery in the midrashic imagination are based on "permanent ontological principles," intrinsic features of the human situation, or on culturally and historically determined conditions, or even on what has been termed coffeehouse talk, remarks made about women within a male gathering, is one that divides the present Jewish community, just as it divides contemporary schools of feminist thought. Although I shall not take a position on these questions, I would like to speculate here about two very different processes of differentiation with- in rabbinic society, one facing inward, involving the differentiation between men and women, the other facing outward, involving the differ- entiation between Jewish men and a different "other" - non-Jews. The nature and function of gender stereotyping and gender imagery in the classical rabbinic period, which has yet to receive full scholarly treatment, must be considered in light of both these processes. In classical rabbinic culture, self-identity was expressed primarily through defining itself in opposition not to the female but, rather, to the gentile community. It is significant that the statement identifying the essential characteristics of Israel as mercy, chastity, and charitableness, is in the context of a midrash explicating why the Gibeonites, who sought to hang the sons of Saul to avenge Saul's earlier acts of violence against them, were unfit to join the assembly of Israel."9 The quality of mercy was viewed as the distinctive ideal around which not only Israel's self-identity as a people was forged, but also around which its model of justice was measured. Not only is Israel uniquely merciful, its model of justice is 168</page><page sequence="31">uniquely merciful, the rabbis asserted. As I have described elsewhere at greater length, rabbinic legal theory posits two distinct legal orders orga- nized around two different models of justice: the Noahide and the Sinaitic. In rabbinic thought, the Noahide obligation to dispense justice, which is binding on non-Jews - the obligation of dinin - corresponds with the justice of conventional sovereign polities. Conventional justice is dedicated to the preservation of social order through pragmatic and coer- cive means. It is exemplified by the attribute of strict justice and is well- suited to the violent nature of its subjects. The Sinaitic system of justice, which is exceptionally lenient to the accused, flows from the special fam- ily relationship that exists between God and Israel and not political com- munities ruled by an earthly sovereign. The Sinaitic model reflects divine justice, which combines strict justice with mercy, a system suited to the merciful character of Israel. These ideas proliferated within a community under foreign rule, in which gentile violence was always a possibility and sometimes a reality. Such conditions, Max Weber claimed, invariably leads to the exaltation and adoption of feminine virtues. One must at least consider the possi- bility that the fluid characterization of mercy, in contrast to strict justice, as both a female and male virtue, is part of a process of rabbinic assimila- tion of traditional feminine roles and virtues in its differentiation of itself from the genuine other: non-Jews. In doing so, the rabbinic conception of itself emerges, as Jeanne Schroeder put it in a different context, as a partial "deconstruction of the traditional masculinist definition of the masculine self."'9 Historical studies reveal that the assignment of gender to a characteristic or quality is far more unstable and fluid than much feminist theory presently admits. This is because the masculine, like the feminine, is constantly being redefined. "Feminism historicized," to use Schroeder's term, shows that in medieval Christian circles various traits or qualities associated with the feminine often became redefined as mascu- line virtues in response to different ideological pressures. The abandoned masculine trait then was attributed to females.9' In rabbinic circles, this process of definition and differentiation was played out, in terms of dichotomous relationships, vis a vis the non-Jew. The feminine trait of mercy was also defined as a masculine virtue while the more traditionally aggressive masculine characteristics, such as vengeance and violence, were attributed to non-Jews. 169</page><page sequence="32">We can also catch a glimpse of this continuing process of differentia- tion in the medieval kabbalah, which is replete with gender images of the divine. The kabbalah, unlike classical rabbinic thought, does see the gen- ders as dichotomous. The mystical kabbalistic tradition explicitly assigns a gender to the attributes of strict justice and mercy. But mercy is identi- fied as masculine and strict justice as feminine. In the kabbalistic schema, the active, merciful, overflowing male must contain the passive, judg- mental, constraining female.92 The traditionally feminine characteristic of mercy, which became so intrinsic to Jewish identity, is now a masculine virtue while the trait of justice is now assigned to the female. Gender imagery in the kabbalistic sources reflects the more androcentric norms and gender stereotypes of general medieval European culture,93 in which theosophic kabbalah flourished. But it is possibly also the logical culmi- nation of an internal process, in which a formerly feminine virtue becomes redefined as masculine and then the abandoned masculine trait is eventually assigned to the female. In the kabbalah, too, we see the interplay of this process of differentiation in terms of the two "others" in rabbinic culture. The nations of the world are also "characterized as sever- ity and harsh judgment" and symbolized by the image of the non-Jewish woman who, in contrast to the Jewish woman, can never exercise mercy.94 Thus, even in the kabbalah, the genuine other is the non-Jew. In classical rabbinic thought, in contrast to the kabbalah, however, the adoption of the trait of mercy as a defining characteristic of Israel did not lead to the imputation of its opposite to females. On the contrary, females simply embodied an intensified form of this trait. Thus, one of the noteworthy aspects of classical rabbinic gender treatment is that it treats the genders as complementary, rather than studies in contrast. And if gender asymet- try, nonetheless, was maintained, it seems to be less a function of asymet- trical valuing of the genders themselves than that, as in any androcentric society, men will elevate the importance of the role they believe they are obligated to perform. 170</page><page sequence="33">III. Conclusion In this essay, I have etched a reciprocal route between ancient rabbinic texts and our current intellectual setting. These ancient texts, still too often misrepresented even in late 20th-century writings otherwise sensi- tive to the idea of the "other," challenge standard conceptions not only of how women are constructed in rabbinic culture but also of how the rab- bis defined themselves and the God they sought to emulate. The hope is that, through continued cross-cultural and trans-historical studies such as this one, the rabbinic tradition will come to be seen as a rich resource for contemporary intellectual discourse. Here, I have emphasized that rab- binic midrash provides a method for transforming ideals of justice into practice. Our midrash reveals that legal and moral ideals such as justice, mercy, compassion, and the like, are in themselves empty abstractions. These ideals can only be grasped through an exploration of the emotion- al attitudes that underlie them, and through careful attention to the rela- tionship between opposing emotions, such as jealousy and love, and to the social settings, such as a pre-existing love relationship, in which these emotional attitudes can be effected. The understanding of emotions and its cultural transmission cannot be achieved solely through philosophic or legal analysis. It also requires the imagination of poets or great storytellers, among which the rabbinic author(s) of our midrash should be counted. 1 The term is from Hans Blumenberg, The Legitimacy of the Modern Age, Robert M. Wallace, trans. (Cambridge: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, 1983), p. 64. Blumenberg argues that, in the passage of historical time, we can observe a process of "functional reoccupation," in which entirely different contents take on identical func- tions in "the system of man's interpretation of the world and himself."

Urbach, The Sages: Their Concepts and Belief, Israel Abrahams, trans., vol.1 (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1975), pp. 420-448. Urbach suggests that the literary repre- sentation of justice engaged in a struggle with God himself is a later development and reflects a conception of mercy as "extruded" from the sphere of justice. This breaks sharply with the earlier tannaite literary representation of the struggle of the two attrib- utes within God, which, in turn, reflects a view of justice and mercy as comprising a complex form of justice encompassing both qualities. According to this conception, as the rabbis state, God is merciful when he exercises justice and not just when he exercises mercy. 27 Scholarship is only now beginning to address the history of rabbinic ideas of justice in such systematic fashion.

Marmorstein, "The Old Rabbinic Doctrine of God," II., Essays in Anthropomorphism (1920; reprint, New York: Ktav Publishing, 1968). Marmorstein posits two distinct rabbinic schools, that of Rabbi Akiva who interpreted biblical anthropomorphisms literally, and that of Rabbi Ishmael, who followed an "allegorical" or "rationalistic" approach. He argues that the former gained ascendancy in the amoraic period. It is unclear, however, whether the debate between the two schools concerned the issue of anthropomorphism as opposed to exeget- ical technique. For a daring argument that the Bible and the early midrashic rabbis conceived of God as a male with a veiled phallus, see Howard Eilberg-Schwartz, God's Phallus (Boston: Beacon Press, 1994).

Therefore, it is difficult to tell whether the last part of the narrative is a later accretion or an integral part of the midrash. I shall treat the narrative as a unity. Indeed, as will become clearer below, (see notes and accompanying text) I believe that the text as a whole must be read in tandem with the chapter from Jeremiah to which the con- clusion of the midrash refers. 40 See discussion and citations in Suzanne Last Stone, "The Transformation of Prophecy," 4 Cardozo Studies in Law and Literature 167, 168 (1992). 41 The shorter version of the midrash ends here. See Buber's edition of Lamentations Rabbah, p. 28, n.23. 42 Resnik, supra note 10 at 87. 43 See Kraemer, supra note 3 at 146; Stern, "Imitatio Hominis," supra note 3. Stern's analy- sis stimulated several of my thoughts about this narrative. Nonetheless, I read this narra- tive quite differently from Stern, who rejects the idea that the narrative is a discourse about the abstract attributes of justice and mercy. Stern offers, instead, a psychological interpretation, arguing that this narrative is a reflection of the "deepest feelings Jews felt in the aftermath of the Destruction - extreme guilt, on the one hand (as though the cat- astrophe had been entirely deserved on account of their great sins), and extreme self-pity, on the other (as though the catastrophe had been wholly undeserved, since it far exceed- ed any transgression they could have committed to warrant such punishment)." Stern, at 166. In Stern's view, these feelings of self-pity lead to the characterization of God as a "heartless despot" who is forced by Rachel "to recognize His 'justice' for what it really is - vanity and petty jealousy." Stern, at 168. 44 See Yohanan Muffs, "Who Will Stand in the Breach?: A Study of Prophetic Intercession" Love and Joy: Law, Language, and Religion in Ancient Israel (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992), pp. 16-24. 45 Id., at 17. 46 Gordon M.

The corporate conception tends to bypass the problem of theodicy by conceding that individuals may suffer unjustly. On the corporate level, the scales are bal- anced, however. David Kraemer has argued that the corporate conception is ancient. The rabbinic innovation consists in placing the individual at the center of the discussion of divine justice. See Kraemer, supra note 3 at 160. Nonetheless, as he also notes, the Babylonian Talmud sometimes reverts to the corporate model in offering solutions to the problem of justice.

He is inclined to discount the idea that the rabbis had any pre-existent and stable conceptions of God's nature that func- tioned as typologies in their interpretations. Instead, he argues that God, as a character in midrash, is conceived along nominalist rather than essentialist lines. He is a "name, a moniker for a locus of functions," and his depiction is determined by "ad hoc exigencies, exegetical requirements, and particular ideological desires."

This midrash is beautifully explicated by Geoffrey Hartman, supra note 8. 80 Boyarin, Carnal Israeh supra note 55 at 134. 81 Id 82 The Babylonian Talmud relates that Rabbi Akiva was originally the shepherd of Kalba Savua and married his master's daughter, despite Kalba Savua's objection. His wife sent him to sit in the study halls to learn Torah, which he did for twelve years. On his return, he overhead his wife's response to a rogue who denigrated Akiva for leaving her a grass widow. Akiva'a wife retorted: "If he were to follow my wishes, he would remain for another twelve years." Akiva immediately returned to the study halls for another twelve years, emerging as an illustrious scholar. And Akiva later tells his students that all his accomplishments are due to Rachel. As with our narrative, the name Rachel is a root metaphor of the Akivan narrative, generating a host of pastoral images and references within the narrative that describe Akiva as the shepherd and Rachel as the beloved ewe lamb, a common biblical metaphor for a love relationship. And when Rachel's daughter follows her example in marriage, the Talmud declares: "ewe follows ewe." Id, at 151-54. (The root metaphor of the ewe and its association with the figure of Rachel is thus conventional. It is a concept current in the culture that is progressively elaborated in different narrative contexts. Cf, Frank Kermode's discussion of the "primitive fable" in The Genesis of Secrecy [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1979].) The story also recalls Jacob's romance with Rachel. There, too, Jacob is a shepherd of Laban, who opposes his marriage to Rachel. Jacob must work first seven years and then another seven to win Rachel's hand. Finally, Jacob's name, Ya'kov, is an "almost perfect anagram" for the Hebrew Akyva. Boyarin, Carnal 176</page><page sequence="39">Israel supra note 55 at 153. 83 Moshe Idel points to a midrashic text that assigns the two names of God (the tetra- grammaton and elohim) associated with the attributes of justice and mercy to the two cherubim on the ark of testimony. One talmudic tradition portrays the two cherubim as male and female. Medieval kabbalistic sources explicitly equate the male and female cherubim both with the two names of God and with the two attributes. These kabbalis- tic texts, Idel argues, may preserve an earlier rabbinic tradition, one indirectly attested to by Philo, who also equates the two cherubim with the two divine attributes, which he describes as the creative and the royal. See Moshe Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988), pp. 128-136. 84 Indeed, Goitein understands the particular name of God known as the tetragrammaton, which Philo and later kabbalistic sources assign to the attribute of strict justice, as mean- ing jealous.
