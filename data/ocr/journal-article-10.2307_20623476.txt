See also note under Novels, Death Call... AUTOBIOGRAPHY Reach for the Sky. Pat Falvey with Dan Col lins. Collins Press. 222 pp + 16 of colour photos. NPG hb 1-898256-32-2. Well-illustrated account of the mostly climbing adventures all over the world of the man Shirley Kelly interviews about it this month. Dan Collins is a journalist. A smart production on fairly heavy paper since there are b/w photos throughout as well as a glistening colour section. +* * Sceal Hiudai She?inm. Eoghan ? D?naill.

Eliza beth McCullough. Marino (USA: Irish American Book Company; in future we'll refer to this as IABCI 190 pp + 8 of photos. ?8.99 pb 1-86023 065-2. "Elegant, spare and wry" memoir of her youth and early adulthood in middle-class Bel fast by a lady bom 1928, and so covering the thir ties and forties. While writing them, she discov ered her diaries for 1941 and '48, and these are printed in full at the end. Unless the diaries are invaluable untouched (and they don't look it), it is surprising that any publisher's editor wouldn't insist that their material be subsumed into the main account, as it is asking a lot of the reader to go back in time to entries like "Auntie came to tea. I fried the pancakes" after having left that time in the narrative. The author's square pegginess suggested by the title is that she was a rebellious girl, with 'quasi-bohemian' tendencies in a pretty strict (Unionist) family. * * A Standing at the Crossroads. Phil O'Keeffe. Brandon. 189 pp ?7.99 pb 0-86322-231 5. This pleasant sequel to Dozen Cobbled Streets: a Liberties childhood was unfortunately a casualty of events at the publishing house, and we didn't receive a review copy for some months after it appeared. Then last month, when we could and should have listed it, it was beside our bed?we were enjoying it so much, we forgot it had to go into print as well! As our reviewer of her first book remarked, she uses dialogue well?not an easy thing in autobiography?and has a nice sense of humour. This is an ambitious young lady's Dublin of the late forties and fifties; a sort of urban Alice Taylor. +* A BIOGRAPHY Deeds not Words : the life and work of Muriel Gahan. Geraldine Mitchell. Town House. 224 pp + 32 of photos. ?9.99 pb 1-86059 046-2.; hb NPG -073-X. It is now widely recog nised (and no longer resented) that protestant people, particularly those financially secure, played outstanding roles in charitable and other social work in Ireland out of all proportion to their numbers. Of course this was partly because they are taught 'noblesse [or richesse] oblige' and partly because for reasons buried in the past they often inherited land and money. Muriel Gahan (1897-1995) was one such, and was instrumental in founding the Country Shop in Dublin, Coun try Markets Ltd, the Irish Homespun Society and the Crafts Council of Ireland and was deeply in volved in the doings of the RDS and ICA. Thus her life, here lovingly?and at some length?de lineated, is very much part of this century's social history. It's indexed, and the many photos go right back to her babyhood. ** * * John Hume. Paul Routledge. Harper Collins. 326 pp + 12 of photos. Stg?20 hb 0-00-255670-7. Routledge is a good English political journalist who, inter alia, covered Northern Ireland for ma jor newspapers for some decades and has written biographies of Arthur Scargill and of Betty Boothroyd [Madam Speaker). It looks a good standard biography with source notes, a short book list and and index. As the blurb says, Hume emerged as the only true statesman of the Trou bles; He collaborated with Routledge. ?? John Stanislaus Joyce : the voluminous life and genius of James Joyce's father. John Wyse Jackson and Peter Costello. Fourth Estate. 512 pp + 16 of photos. Stg?20 hb 1-85702-417-6. A satisfyingly complete life of the man who con tributed a great deal to Joyce's work as well as to his character?in some ways a glorious nonen tity?with family tree and photos. The footnotes system (reference is to the numbered bibliog raphy) makes one wonder why not simplify by another step, and just put the book reference number at the appropriate place? The well known apoplectic portrait used on the jacket surely sums up the man precisely. // People's Champion : the life of Alexan der Bowman, pioneer of Labour politics in Ireland. Terence Bowman. Ulster Historical Foundation. 237 pp + 8 of photos. Stg?9.99 pb 0 901905-82-8. A Belfast home-rule councillor and trades-union organiser who was the first work ing-class Irishman to seek a seat at Westminster This academic study is by the subject's great grandson, a newspaper editor, whose research included private papers and the recollections of Bowman's grandchildren. Source notes, bibliog raphy, index: a very solid job. * # // Richard Tyrrell : Elizabethan captain. Jennifer A. Kelly. Tyrrellspass Development Asso ciation, distrib. Maree Kelly, Tyrrellspass, Co Westmeath. 198 pp ?10 pb 0-9531146-9-4. A local historian kept coming across Captain Tyrrell in state papers of the 16th and early 17th century and his prominence in the Elizabethan wars. This stimulated Ms Kelly's thorough-looking re search, published to celebrate the 400th anniver sary of the Battle of Tyrrellspass. Though clear and systematic, illustrated and with ballads, the music of Tyrrell's March and a bit of folklore from The Irish Catholic in the twenties, it is more a work of scholarship and history than of litera ture. Jennifer Kelly is a polymath with a BSc, now in pursuit of a doctorate in music. ** * * // The Wilde Album. Merlin Holland. Fourth Estate. 192 pp Stg?12.99 hb 17 x 13 cm 1-85702 782-5. A charming and valuable pocket-sized col lection of photographs, reproductions and fac similes, captioned and with a linking text by Oscar's only grandson. Index. -* / Wolfe Tone. Henry Boylan, Gill &amp; Macmillan. 151 pp ?6.99 pb 0-7171-2640-4. First published in 1981, (when apparently we didn't receive a re view copy), this looks a useful short life, with sources cited, bibliography and index, by the author of the Dictionary of Irish Biography. It's a facsimile of the original setting, with an excep tionally handsome cover and title page to make the most of the demand during the bicentenary. COUNTRY LIFE Country Living. Liz Kavanagh. Wolfhound Press. 255 pp ?7.99 pb 0-86327-609-1. Magazine editors know the immense value of a regular col umnist, and the Irish Farmers Journal are lucky to have had Cork-born farmer's wife Liz (recte Mary Lynch; she came out of her nom de closet three years ago) for twenty years. The good col umnist becomes a character, can get away with a bit of naughtiness (by saying what everyone says but doesn't always print), can play the fool or be deadly serious, and Liz seems to be all this to all her readers, and thus might find new ones in book form. The form is a good one, because of the wordage limit and the requirement of both a cer tain continuity and a certain containment. Sensi bly the book is organised by season, and the su per cover shows that designers Slick Fish can be content without fancy computer-cleverness when a good photo is at stake. Incidentally we have been looking for (a) a bookseller and (b pos sibly) an antiquarian book person to do columns for BI for years, and have not yet landed the fish we had in mind. Come to think of it, what about a librarian? + // CRITICISM Attila J?zsef : 'Can you take on this awful life?' Thomas Kabdebo. Cardinal Press, Dun boyne Road, Maynooth, Co Kildare; distrib. in Germany, Hungary and Eastern Europe by Argu mentum, Budapest. 220 pp + frontispiece.NPG pb 1-8979220-2-7 (Argumentum: 963-446-043-7). Homage?a critical appreciation in English?to a Hungarian poet (1905-37). Ted Hughes found near-literal translations of Jozsef vindicated the claim made for him to be "one of the most solidly and thoroughly original poets of modem times". Dr Kabedbo, director of the NUI libraries at Maynooth, is a Hungarian writer and historian. Notes, bibliography, index of poems.

Cambridge University Press. 329 pp Stg?13.95/$18.95 pb 0-521-47987 8; hb Stg?37.50/$59.95 -47471-X. A worthy addi tion to 30 titles of the Cambridge Companions to Literature which are meant as 'essential intro ductions' for students: 15 illustrated chapters by competent authorities on the background and context, Wilde's work, and its themes and influ ences. * A #* / (pb) Christianity and Modern European Literature. Daniel Murphy. Four Courts Press. 544 pp ?35 hb 1-85182-295-X. Wide-ranging ex amination of Christian themes, motifs and atti tudes in the work of twelve authors?one per chapter: Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Unamuno, Mauriac, Eliot, Pasternak, Mandelstam, Akhma tova, Auden, Patrick White, Milosz, and Brod sky?by, a senior lecturer in education at Trinity College who has previously written on Comenius, Tolstoy, Martin Buber. The book's stated aim is to show that "Christianity is not a diminishing force in European life and culture," an unfortunately ambiguous phrase (since the commonest use of 'diminish' is transitive), and unfortunately limiting too, for the book is a dis cerning examination of writer and writing in the context of tradition, faith and eternity, and not at all polemic in style or theme. ++ * A ^ / oo La litterature irlandaise. Jacqueline Genet et Claude Fierobe. Masson &amp; Armand Colin, 34 bis, rue de VUniversite, F-75007 Paris. 320 pp NPG pb 2-200-01721-9. A quite extraordinary achievement: an encyclopedic and systematic ex pose for the francophone from Latin and classical Irish texts to present-day plays, poetry and prose in Irish and English. We were drawing ink to re mark that this had the scope and depth of a me thodical (instead of alphabetic) Oxford Compan ion to Irish Literature when we notice that that, with the Field Day Anthology, is acknowledged as 'ouvrage de reference indispensable'. The se lect bibliography is short and includes but is not confined to French titles; the index is of names only. Typography is pretty dense but clear, cover very attractive. We'd guess price is the equivalent of?20-?25. ^ A * Modern Irish Writers : a bio-critical sourcebook. ed. Alexander G. Gonzalez. Aldzvych Press. 479 pp Stg?67.50 hb 0-86172 105-5. Here are entries for 78 writers, living and dead, by 54 academics, American (as far as we can ascertain) to their toenails. In an average of four pages you get a biography, a note on major works and themes, another on their critical recep tion, and a select list of books by and books on. Among the omissions are Seamus Deane, Roddy Doyle, Neil Jordan, Brendan Kennelly, Donagh MacDonagh, Bernard MacLaverty, Padraic Pearse and Forrest Reid. The following were omitted because they didn't write about Ireland enough! Iris Murdoch, G. B. Shaw and Oscar Wilde. Included are Mary M. Colum, Desmond Egan, John Eglinton and Eithne Strong. At some point the book was going to run to a hundred writers. There's general bibliographies, notes on contributors and an index. * A oo A William Butler Yeats Encyclopedia. Sam McCready. Aldwych Press. 509 pp Stg?69.50 hb 0-86172-106-3. Alphabetical listings of his ma jor collections (their contents and publishing his tory), plays (outline plots, profiles of main char acters, production history), mythic figures, places Yeats frequented and organisations to which he belonged, and biographies of family, friends and all sorts of associated figures. This really belongs under Reference rather than Criti cism since McCready, although well qualified to do so, actually avoids interpretation or assess ment, and sticks to facts and information. There's a biochronology, a select bibliography and (curi ously in view of the nature of the book) an index. * ?d * / oo FOLKLORE Dublin Pub Life and Lore : an oral his tory. Kevin C. Kearns. Gill &amp; Macmillan. 287 pp + 48 of photos. ?3.99 pb 0-7171-2609-9. Into pa perback (at about half the price) for the lovely book that appeared just two years ago, the cream of which is the oral testimony of publicans and regulars transcribed from tape. See the welcome reappearance of the next book. * A // Dublin Street Life and Lore: an oral his tory. Kevin C. Kearns. Gill &amp; Macmillan. 245 pp ?12.99 pb 0-7171-2611-0. First paperback of Kearns' study (just as enchanting as the pub one above and more varied) of lamplighters, sweeps and other such outmoded figures as well as post men (but not milkmen for some reason), street and market sellers, bus and tram men and cab bies, animal dealers and drovers, with verbatim accounts of their lives, and photographs. In case binding from the lamented Glendale Press six years ago this was priced at ?14.95. Slimmer than the pubs book, its photos are scattered among the text, which means a smoother and heavier paper throughout. G&amp;M must have got hold of the original film, for the reproduction looks as good as the original. ++ A # / The Wondrous Land : the faery faith of Ireland. Kay Mullin. Capall Bann Publishing, Freshfields, Chieveley, Berks RG20 8TF (USA dis trib. Holmes Publishing Group). 197pp Stg?10.95 pb 1-86163-010-7. A spirit told Mutlin, a clinical psychologist, that it was her task to hold open the doorway between mankind and the faery king dom. This is the result of her subsequent 'exten sive research' in Ireland. It is in rather small type with little decorations (rather than 'exquisite il lustrations') by Cormac Figgis, and some verses by 'seer' Gabriel Rosenstock. There are some ref erences and a bibliography. * / FOOD &amp; DRINK Everyday Gourmet. Gerry Galvin. O'Brien Press. 144 pp ?6.99 pb 0-86278-537-5. A very showy but also perfectly practical selection of 77 mostly showy and modem-style recipes for main and subsidiary courses, and things for kids, well ordered and laid out, lavishly colour-illustrated and fairly usefully indexed. Galvin has been twice Chef of the Year and his Drimcong House has twice won the Bord F?ilte Supreme Award. The astonishing price may be explained by Tesco's'partnership'in the enterprise. + A Year at Ballymaloe Cookery School. Darina Allen. Gill &amp; Macmillan. 192 pp ?19.99 hb 28x24 cm 0-7171-2619-6. Did we say 'showy' of Mr Galvin above? 'Sumptuous' is perhaps the next step, and this easily deserves it. It provides a selection of starter, main, vegetable and pud ding recipes (joy! we are of an age that finds it difficult to use the words sweet or dessert with conviction) for the different seasons, dished up with interesting memoirs about starting and run ning the extraordinary place. The typography we aren't actually mad about, but it works perfectly well. The colour photography is tops, and we note with immense satisfaction that one of these brilliant photographers is called Melanie Eclare. Maybe she's plain and elderly Just leave us to our dream of sharing Oysters Chez Panisse with her. Ballymaloe must be one of the seven wonders of Ireland.

It very thoroughly introduces the neophyte to the county and its administrative districts, all the sources of information and how to access and use them, with bibliography (with a special section on Mayo in 1798), useful addresses and index. There are facsimiles of some census sheets, regis ters etc. to familiarise the reader with what he will encounter. ++ * * // GUIDES Irish Churches and Monasteries : an historical and architectural guide. Se?n D. O'Reilly. Collins Press. 212 pp ?7.99 pb 1-898256 14-4. An entry?typically three pages of text and a photo?for each of forty representative and in teresting buildings all over the country, chrono logically arranged from Skellig Michael to St Mi chael's in Creeslough which was opened about 1,500 years later, in 1971?one of only two build ings in the book that are unrelated to early or classical styles. In the Creeslough one the author refers to "the rationale of the fan" (meaning its plan is shaped like one). He says the sanctuary is set in "the central curve of the fan" but we think he means its apex. There's a pretty helpful glos sary illustrated with drawings. Nothing on the author or his qualifications; he's called Sean on the cover and Sean inside. ++ * ^/ HEALTH The Irish Drugs Epidemic. Michael ffrench-O'Carroll. The Collins Press. 182 pp ?6.99 pb 1 -898256-24-1. On drug and alcohol addiction (with case studies, particularly of young people) and particularly its social consequences, treat ments and possible national policies. A section on the 'legislation' of drugs turns out to be about legalisation, which the author argues strongly against. He has been a member of Dublin Corpo ration, the D?il and the Senate, was Medical Offi cer of Cork in 1976, later did specialist training on addiction in America, founded an addiction treatment centre in Ireland and is now consultant for the Cuan Mhuire centres. +* * // HISTORY ??n?

Four Courts Press. 220 pp ?19.95 hb 1 85182-333-6. A useful-looking (and well-sized? what an art it is not to get too longwinded, espe cially in something that started as a doctoral thesis) study of the Irish manifestations of thirties fascism, which apparently was politically quite significant in forcing a realignment of pro-treaty ites under Fine Gael and thus presenting a con siderable opposition to Dev. Interesting that among members' aims were "free speech and the development of a social network".

Four Courts Press (USA: Cornell University Press) 371 pp ?35 hb 1-85182 303-4. A stylish and erudite consideration of me dieval Irish writings on the saints and other he roic figures. 'Conversing' is not idly used in the title, for Nagy, who teaches Celtic studies in the University of California at Los Angeles, cites Bakhtin on modern novels' sine qua non of 'speaking persons', finding the same need for dialogue in those long-ago writings, and "the more contentious the dialogue... the better... to stimulate and preserve memory". It is not by chance that the first thing this column looks for in novels is dialogue; though we're not hot shots at Bakhtin's level of criticism or Nagy's medieval Latin and Irish, clearly we have our priorities right. * * A oo Costello : the true story of a Peninsular War rifleman. Eileen Hathaway. Shinglepicker, 28 Bonfield Avenue, Swanage, Dorset BH19 1PL. 378 pp Stg?19.95 hb 0-9522782-3-5. Edward Costello, bom in Mountmellick in 1788, survived most of the major battles of the Peninsular war as a private soldier, though four times wounded. He published his Adventures of a Soldier in 1841. Mrs Hathaway has done considerable research to re tell the tale, using edited bits of Costello's book and the writings of other contemporaries, and finding portraits, paintings and even modern photos of battlefields to illustrate it. With bibliog raphy, notes and index it is a readable and some times gripping account of war. * * / An Gorta M?r. ed. P?draig ? Fiannachta.

First published by University of Minnesota in 1958? and here in paperback for the first time ever?is what was no doubt a ground-breaking work that set out to open lines of enquiry into the migration phenomenon. Thus it does not pursue every theme itself, and the author's 1997 note implies that emigration's impact on neither the Catholic Church in Ireland nor on Irish politics have been fully studied yet. He does consider causes and impact both in America and in Ireland, his statis tical tables look exhaustive and useful, and all is annotated, bibliographed and indexed. After moving to Russian and world history, Schrier, an emeritus professor at Cincinnati, has turned again to Ireland to help edit a selection of letters from emigrants from the 17th century, many from his own collection. * * // Linen, Family and Community in Tul lylish, County Down. Marilyn Cohen. Four Courts Press. 287 pp ?45 hb 1-85182-312-3. A most interesting looking social history by an an thropologist, that encompasses the economic, class, gender, sectarian and other factors associ ated with the linen business in the Bann Valley over two centuries. While technically this may belong under local history, it is undoubtedly of greater general value than many books in this section. Anyone who speaks with nostalgia of the good old days of the linen industry should read some of the contemporary verbatim reports of inspectors, weavers and mill children; they will find themselves drawn on into the text of a very readable book as well as a work of scholarship. Illustrations, tables, index. * + * Priests and Prelates of Armagh in the age of reformations 1518-1558. Henry A. Jeffer ies. Four Courts Press. 213 pp ?35 hb 1-85182 * 336-0. A study of the clergy, their organisation and finances?both inter anglicos and inter hi bernicos?just before the Tudor reformations, and then of the latters' impact on the parishes, liturgy and clergy themselves. It discovers no great anticlericalism before, and little change in the liturgy after (until Elizabeth's time), though the Pope's jurisdiction was curtailed among the 'English' and to some extent among the Trish' too. Source notes, bibliography and index. + * The Year of Liberty: the great Irish rebel lion of 1798. Thomas Pakenham. Weidenfeld &amp; * Nicolson. 424 pp + 16 of plates. ?20 hb 0-297 81955-0. The major 1969 book (published as Pak enham notes on the eve of the new Troubles) re issued with an added chronology and glossary. Rather than update the bibliography, the author lists recent major works on the period and refers the reader to their bibliographies. -* A * / HISTORY INSTITUTIONAL The Hist and Edmund Burke's Club, an an thology . . . 1747-1997. Declan Budd and Ross Hinds. Lilliput Press. 437pp?30hb 1-901866-00 9 (special edn. -01-7). An exhaustive scrap-book of records and memories of Trinity College's fa mous debating society set out with a fittingly classical and dignified empressement. Among the speeches and recollections (interesting to lead those of currently eminent men from or about their youth) are summary notes that knit the book together into a satisfactory history with in dex. There are many illustrations, mainly por traits, and the original minutes ("Mr Burke, President") make surprisingly legible end papers. The authors are both distinguished hon orary members of Hist, one a judge of the High Court, the other a physicist and senior manager. HISTORY LOCAL Armagh : city of light and learning. Maureen Campbell. Cottage Publications, 15 Bal lyhay Road, Donaghadee BT21 ONG. 96 pp Stg?12.95 hb 18 x 25 cm (wide) 1-900935-05-8. More a gift or memento book than a history per haps, and not really a guide because the few busi nesses listed at the back are there because they contributed sponsorship. There's notes on myth and legend and a 16-page narrative history, sand wiching a page each on thirty interesting or his toric places (city and county), each facing a pleas ant watercolour by Joe Hynes. The glazed cover boards are padded as fancy prayerbooks and dia ries used to be. There's a 22-book bibliography.

Almost identical formula to that of the Armagh book above, whose notes apply to this except that this author is more his torian than journalist, and watercolourist Gerry Clarke (a local man as was Armagh's), is much more self-assured and stylish, a master of the un retouched, luminous wash and a first-class draughtsman, though some aficionados may well prefer Armagh's Joe Hynes as more sensitive and delicate.

Edward Laxton. Bloomsbury. 256 pp + 16 of colour reproductions. Stg?6.99 pb 0-7475-3500-0. We weren't entrusted with the hardback last year, which is sad as some of the black-and-white illustrations and facsimiles are really too small for the presumably reduced pa perback format. The sixteen paintings by Rodney Charman, modem but adopting a contemporary style, are splendid as one reviewer said (the very word) and not bad at all at this reduction. It seems a pretty scrupulous account for a popular-level book by an ex-journalist (late news editor of two Fleet-street dailies), zooming in on personal sto nes via letters and journals. There's an index. // HUMOUR Irish Pub Crack. Eileen Boyle. Blackstaff Press. 96 pp Stg?4.99 pb 0-85640-607-4. Jokes, puzzles and amazing information gathered over the years by a Dromore publican, with cartoons by James Campbell. Joke books are sometimes a rip-off; this one is packed with things and very good value. + ^ S Soundbites : a dictionary of Irish political quotations. Aubrey Dillon-Malone. Leopold Publishing. 127pp ?4.99pb 0-9526865-5-4. Over six hundred quotables, including a special sec tion on the 1997 election. Lucky they didn't wait for the Presidential one, which seems to consist mainly of previously mostly modest people tell ing us how charming, principled and accom plished they are?and of slipping in the dirty dig about the others when they can get away with it. Good stuff, but hardly a dictionary. ** / Twelve Days of Chaos. Frank Kelly. O'Brien Press/USA: IABC. 63 pp ?5.99/$9.99 pb 20 x 21 cm 0-86278-546-4. Confirmed bachelor Gubnet O'Lunacy (lives with the Mammy) is be ing wooed by Nuala, who obviously feels some radical action is indicated. Here are his increas ingly frantic letters to her as day by day she sends him a partridge in a pear tree, three French hens, some lecherous milkmaids, leaping lords and heaven knows what else, which causes havoc ? cote de chez O'Lunacy. This is quite widely known?and loved?as a recording. Here it is in print at last, with cartoonist Terry Willers in his element. He can portray ten pipers piping with the best of them. ++ LIBRARIES Ulster Libraries, archives, museums and ancestral heritage centres. Robert K. O'Neill. Ulster Historical Foundation. 192 pp Stg?6.99 pb 21x11 cm (narrow) 0-901905-79-8. This very at tractive little directory (to the nine counties of Ulster) was greeted here with enthusiasm, be cause books is our business, and we have a spe cial interest in systematised access to information and literature. It is done by an American fond of exclamation marks and with Americans in mind?advice on whether to hire a car, and a helpful hint that unionists are not (as you might think) those keen on a united Ireland. It lists all you could want to know about each institution, mostly alphabetically by place?i. e. Linenhall Library is under Belfast. However branch librar ies get very strange treatment: some are listed under the place or town where their headquar ters is to be found; thus Ballybofey Library is to be found not under B or D for Donegal but L for Letterkenny where Donegal County Library has its administrahve centre (and Ballybofey is not important enough to list in the ill-nourished in dex). Others however are listed by place: Water side Branch under D for Deny, not L for London derry or O for Omagh where the Western Education and Library Board keeps a motherly eye on it. For a quick flick-check the alphabetical key to each page is give on a black index tab un der the page number, but believe it or not this is omitted from the first page of each letter section (usually the one you'd look for). There is no index to the special holdings of different libraries, but Brian Traynor adds a very useful table for gene alogists and other researchers showing what valuations are available between 1823 and 1930 for every parish. ** ^/ Vanity Enough : the story of the origins and development of Newry Public Library. Patrick J. Byrne. Southern Education and Library Board Library Service, Armagh. 79 pp Stg?3.50 brochure 30 x 21 cm 0-902962-09-5. Newry Free Library was opened in 1897 and only recently a new purpose-built library building was opened. This history, completed and edited by the daugh ter of the author, who sadly died before it could be published, goes back much further and is also a history of printing and publishing in the town, with remarkable lists of Newry-printed books from 1761 and of printers. There's also a list of librarians (with salaries!), some figures from li brary accounts, a bibliography and some illustra tions. ** * / LIFE SKILLS Relationships and Sexuality. Carmel Wynne. Mercier Press. 176 pp ?7.99 pb 1-85635 185-8. A handbook for parents and teachers on how best to inculcate good attitudes and behav iour among young people by someone who teaches the subject in both primary and secon dary schools and has four daughters. It seems to conform with currently received attitudes but in two places where we opened at random we re ceived not unsatisfactory advice but essentially none. One was on answering children's ques tions on homosexuality where it might possibly be helpful to reply "I wonder where did you hear that?" (of a specific question), but certainly such parrying or running for cover is not enough. Similarly "I'm not sure I understand what you are asking me," in reply to the question "How do gay people make love?" may be a good precau tion but cannot be final. It amounts to forcing the child to use the awkward words first, which won't be appreciated by them.' In the end we're told 'some parents are tolerant, others are preju diced ...' Really? Then we came on the teenage question "Why save sex for marriage?" and are told that mentioning sin, unwanted pregnancy or AIDS smacks of disapproval or fear; we shouldn't be so negative, but Ms Wynne is not very positive herself; she tells us to teach adoles cents to think of the emotional and spiritual con sequences, but doesn't describe what these are, whether they're good or bad, or how to teach them except that we should do so in a 'safe, non judgmental environment'. MISCELLANEA How to Win Competitions. Maeve Con rick. Marino. 80pp?4.99pb 1-86023-054-7. What a good idea! A collection of strategies and tips for what (according to Maeve) is called a comper. She has over the years won two two-week holi days in Florida, three microwaves, a dinner serv ice, two pairs of rollerblades, pots of money, furry toys and dozens of other desirable prizes, so she must have more than good luck herself. +* */ MUSIC Gregorian Chant Experience.

Each of forty chants comes with music finely hand-notated, the Latin text with translation and then a page or two for meditation on the theme. Dom Placid Murray OSB contributes a chapter, there are chronology, sources, bibliography and index to chants. Noirin has sung in New York, Rio de Janeiro and Copenhagen (UN summits), Bei jing (World Women Summit) and Costa Rica (Peace Gathering), and has made a number of records. Typography of the book is very well done to tune in with the hand-drawn melodies and words. A lovely gift. ** * ^ / (book) NORTH Between War and Peace : the political future of Northern Ireland. Paul Bew et al. Lawrence &amp; Wishart. 237 pp Stg?12.99 pb 0 85315-771-5. Writing of the perspectives of un ionists and nationalists, the blurb says: "Though not sanguine about the prospects for change, [the authors] argue the need for the development of a modem democratic politics ..." thus surely in validating the book at a stroke. It also remarks that Mo Mowlam has not found new ways to a settlement. Well, she has got most of the parties into one room, and unlike the authors does not seem to pin her hope on changes of perspective so much as on a working forebearance. The authors are all professors of politics in the North with a number of books to their credit jointly and singly. Paul Teague (political economy) is odd man out and probably responsible for the middle chapters on economy, employment and cross border co-operation. Bew and Henry Patterson are a well established double act. They reprint a 1997 speech by Tony Blair and a 1995 one by Ber tie Ahem (advertised as 1997 also in the contents list). ^/ An Irish Voice : the quest for peace. Gerrv Adams. Mount Eagle. 287 pp ?9.99 pb 1-902011 01-5. Selected pieces, June 1993 to July 1997, from Adams' column in the New York paper The Irish Voice give as clear an account of the Sinn Fein position over that critical period as you could hope for, though obviously directed at American readers. Index, chronology, glossary and notes on the protagonists. +* A Provos: the IRA and Sinn Pein. Peter Taylor. Bloomsbury. 384 pp + 16 of photos. Stg?16.99 hb 0-7475-3392-X. Billed as the book of a TV se ries?Taylor has made over fifty documentaries on the conflict for ITV and wrote some major ones for the BBC?this is a discerning and well informed account, quickly but fairly sketching in the background history of the quarter-century conflict which is then quite graphically re counted, citing as sources mainly other books or newspapers.

Last month we wrongly guessed that most of the unattributed laudatory reviews quoted about the author's previous book Gang lands might be "as much fiction as the book", since publishers are usually eager to ascribe such puffs. The author-publisher tells us that in fact "Pacy and topical" came from In Dublin, "Gives an insight..." from Stephen Rae, "Highly erotic" from The Cork Evening Echo, "Excellent first novel that could easily be adapted as a screen play" from An Phoblacht and "A real cannot-put down?a bloody good read" from the Garda Re view. Unfortunately however we now won't be able to review the new book ourselves, because there has been mention of legal action against us if a full review is not published in this issue. Even if we had a review ready, this would disqualify it. Eadar Muir is Tfr. Standish O'Grady; Niall Johnny Sheamaisin ? Domhnaill a d'aistrigh. An Gum. 163 pp ?4.95 pb 1-85791-235-7.

Mather Publi cations, 6 Mather Road North, Mount Merrion, Co Dublin, tel. 01-288 1230. 249 pp ?7.99 pb 0 9531336-0-5. Self-published comic novel about a schizoid actor who takes on the medical profes sion (to which dear reader we think the author may belong) and makes a precarious living by being admitted to hospitals under various names and diagnoses, the final one being Munchausen syndrome. As far as it goes the love interest doesn't, being platonic. Not a foot put wrong in design or production, and the price falls neatly between the ?9.99 of the showy paperback origi nal and the ?5.95 of the mass-market job. ** -*&gt; Groundwork. Robert Welch. Blackstaff Press. 210 pp Stg?8.99 pb 0-85640-608-2. This looks original and interesting. Readers are familiar with the family saga that spans generations. This, more free of the unities of character and time, uses two Munster families and darts to and fro to find them in different times?even as far back as the Elizabethan conquest?to delineate not just their family dramas but the contours of the coun try of the past that have gone to their making. It will be interesting to see how this is received. Readers are conservative creatures, and like a novel to be a historical novel, a saga, a thriller, a psychological novel or whatever. However this is reasonably shaped and contained?there is a cast-list up front that is far from fearsome com pared with most saga novels. It just might be come a classic. * * A # Love Like Hate Adore. Deirdre Purcell. Town House in assocn with Macmillan London. 491 pp ?15.99 hb 1-86059-045-4. A new depar ture for Purcell as we indicated in our September interview?much less of the frantic heavy plot ting of her first books and much more psycho logical insight and character development. It's set in Dublin and is about a brother-sister rela tionship, fraught with drama. The jacket plays all the current tricks with varnish and embossing, the text, a lovely big size of Perpetua, is about two lines deeper per page that is comfortable (and we ask again: why bother with author or title run ning heads in a novel?). And you can stop trying to make sense out of the title?it's one of those play mantras like 'tinker, tailor' but without the commas. + A * / Mac Tire. Seamas Ceitinn. Coisceim. 159 pp ?4 pb.

Joseph Tomelty. La gan Press. 210 pp Stg?5.95 pb 1-873687-11-7. Re print of the dark, 'harrowing' novel that was published by Jonathan Cape in 1948, by the man from Portaferry who was well known at the time?not only in Ulster?as playwright and ac tor, and then became a household name in the North with his radio soap opera The McCooeys in which he acted as well. Though he died only two years ago in his mid eighties, sadly he had writ ten nothing since a car crash in 1954. It is about a man whose imagined guilt as a murderer turns to madness?and a real murder. While striking as a cover illustration, the Colin Middleton painting seems to have nothing in common with the book except a nautical theme. +* A * // Na Rosa go Brach. Fionn Mac Cumhaill.

John Dunne's critique of last year's hardback (?15.99) was interesting: no literary fire works?indeed rather dull 'grey' writing? but a "tender, honest and moving love story"?a gay one as it happens but there's no stridency or moralising about that and the characters are all flesh-and-blood. This is ob viously the work of a real and maturing writer, no show-off supernova. There's a garland of enthusiastic critics' puffs and a first-class cover.

The bestselling rural memoirist's first venture into fiction, about a farrning family torn apart from within in the early fifties. Very handsomely got up, this is the first production of the new Mount Eagle imprint.

Each of these two books provides about 200 photos of people, groups (schools, teams, employees), buildings, sports events, transport, industries, with a few facsimile notices, advertisements or programmes. Most captions are short and to the point, but here and there they launch into a para graph or two on some local feature. Few photos originate before the present century and there is a complete time-mix?"How modem those boys look," we remarked of a (well-weathered look ing) shot of Banbridge anglers, only to find it was taken in 1997! The books are nearly as good as (certainly no better than) the long series of local and thematic photo books, landscape in format and grossly under-priced, produced by the Friar's Bush Press, which we hope are still avail able. * ^/ Fancy Footwork : selected plays. Miriam Gallagher. Society of Irish Playwrights, 19 Parnell Square, Dublin 1.565 pp NP? pb 565 pp. The first edition of this baker's dozen of plays apparently appeared in 1991 at ?6.99, though that was much shorter (360 pages) and perhaps plays have been added. We are not even sure of the publisher: the Society of Irish Playwrights appears on the title page in the publisher's place, but later we're told it's published 'in association' with them. Gal lagher has been a highly original and imaginative playwright since 1983 and here are full-length and short plays that have been performed all over Ireland and indeed the world, sometimes in translation, with notes on the original casts and performances. It would be too hefty to use as an acting edition?800 grams or a pound and three quarters! ++ A The Secret Fall of Constance Wilde. Thomas Kilroy.

First produced at the Abbey last month for the Dublin Theatre Fes tival, a play of transformations and silent masked figures, featuring mainly Oscar Wilde and that rather overlooked character his wife, though Lord Alfred Douglas does get a line or two, and the sexual relationships of the three is the subject (there's a character called Androgyne: cf the priest in the play below), with the court case in the background. Talbot's Box of two decades ago is reissued in tandem. ++ A / Talbot's Box. Thomas Kilroy. Gallery Books. 63 pp ?6.95 pb 1-85235-198-5. Reissue of the play which Gallery first published in 1979 and which our lamented reviewer then, Kane Archer, greeted with enthusiasm. It is about Matt Talbot (1856-1925), 'the workers' saint' and ex-alcoholic. There's a short introduction by the playwright and an intriguing instruction: "The priest figure should be played by an actress." Weren't we dar ing twenty years ago??and note the presence of Androgyne in the play above.

Now here is a selection of his poetry (and a few short prose poems) beautifully set and laid out with English versions on each facing page, an appreciative introduction by Robert Welch and a chronology which shows he has taught at UCC for fifty years, with short breaks at lesser places like Harvard and Oxford. The cover design is one of those clever typographical games that adorn Cork books, and doesn't relate much to me clean, classic simplicity inside. *+ A Ruithmean's Neo-Rannan / Rainn agus Neamhrainn.

Sadly the last of the fascinating collec tions of responses from famous people to being asked what is their favourite poem. Our first im pression is how many famous people there are? we'd heard of most of this 182, but not of Oscar Hijuelos who loves Mandelstam but thinks he's called Mandelbaum! Ah yes, we've found there are notes on contributors, and Oscar is an Ameri can novelist. The series was started and run by senior pupils at Wesley College in Dublin (MacMonagle teaches English there), and the profits go to the charity Concern. The respon dent's letter is printed as well as the chosen poem, so it's an anthology raisonn?, and there are who An Duanaire: poems of the dispos ARCTIC IRELAND On the last day of 1739, Ireland awoke to find itself in the grip of what was in effect a mini Ice Age. Some were appalled. Others were enchanted by the novelty of it all. Carnivals, dances and sheep-roastings were held on the ice. But the euphoria proved fleeting. In its wake came an almost biblical ordeal by drought, flood, fire, famine and plague, that has few parallels in the recorded history of the island. Illustrated, 96pages, ?4.95 The extraordinary story of the FORGOTTEN FAMINE of 1740-41 DAVID DICKSON Modem Ireland has experienced not one but two Great Famines. That of 1845-51 needs no introduction. However the crisis of 1740-41 has been all but forgot ten. Arctic Ireland lifts the veil on this older, more enigmatic famine, and attempts to restore it to its rightful place in our historical self-understanding.

Incidentally if the pagination we give for Gallery books seems wrong, it's because they sometimes count the first two blanks and we don't. Inside this exceptionally crisp cover de sign (using a painting by Mary G.

Lagan Press. 66 pp Stg?5.95 pb 1 873687-37-0 (hb Stg?12.95 -81-8). A very pleas antly produced little collection?his sixth?by the man who was recognised by the Irish Times poetry prize two years ago as much more than a journeyman poet who has survived from the for ties. A recent revised autobiography came out under the title The Sash my Father Wore, with an orange parade on the cover. That and this collec tion's title might give a false impression, that (with or without a horse) he's a spokesman for orangeism and unionism. In fact he long exiled himself in England, chose Dublin for retirement and, while conscious of and interested in his roots, is always sophisticated and cosmopolitan in tone?and very often deeply touching, what ever your affiliations. ++ A / The Rose and the Blade : new and se lected poems 1957-1997. John Campbell. Lagan Press. 156 pp Stg?5.95 pb 1-873687-71-0. Aselec tion from Saturday Night in York Street (1982), An Ould Jobbin Poet ('89) and Memories of York Street ('91), together with some previously uncol lected verses which include an ode to the Belfast Public Lib-bra-eh. Campbell is a true rhymer or street bard, bom 1936. That's the generation to which rhyme and metre were pretty important, grammar and meaning sometimes bowing to them?but John Campbell has the facility (and stickability) to avoid such infelicities, and some times gets near Kipling or Betjeman. For scholars he provides notes ("Written on a page of a checker's notebook in the Chapel Shed") and dates, and there's an index of titles and first lines. Selected Poems. Medbh McGuckian. Gal lery Books. 92 pp ?7.95 pb 1-85235-203-5; hb ?13.95 -204-3. The selection is from the poet's five published collections, with some poems re vised, and it was made?no doubt with her con nivance?by Dillon Johnston and publisher Peter Fallon. It is a Poetry Book Society recommenda tion as well it might be, for she has collected many honours. She is not easy but fascinating, but there again much much more than a puzzle.

He's the real article: the modernist, nihilist, rebel, iconoclast, anarchist [close thesaurus] who's never going to compromise with any es tablishment. He also has considerably mastery of words. Sample senryu "on the creative ambigu ity of American English": Life is profound shit. The famous are into it deeper than others. As with young people and those who profess no guiding philosophy, one very interesting exercise with such writers is to find and map the basic morality (often much stronger than that of osten sibly religious or law-abiding people) under neath the naughtiness. A lively and readable col lection. 44 A */ Verbum et Verbum. Micheal Fanning. Salmon. 84pp?539pb 1-897648-89-8. Amedical man living in Dingle, Fanning is said to be a 20th century St John of the Cross, who "picks up the mystical Irish where AE left it some sixty years ago". The title sequence (16 pages, 26 poems) is pieces on selected pages of the Book of Kells. Finely done, though the old problem of short lines slipping off to the left of the page annoys us as usual. 44 ** # // The Yellow Book. Derek Mahon. Gallery Books. 55 pp ?635 pb 1-85235-205-1; hb ?1235 -2?6-X. It is not for the likes of us to comment. Mahon is a major and getting to be a senior (b. 1941) poet, and internationally recognised as such. This collection is an event, and Gallery as always can be counted on to do it justice?and indeed not to profiteer. 44 ^ A // PSYCHOLOGY Healing Life's Hurts. Michael Hardiman. Gill &amp; Macmillan. 251 pp ?8.99 pb 0-7171-2636 6. The author, a psychologist counselling in Ire land and specialising in traumata from child hood (no shortage of them), says in his introduction that "many approaches to healing and growth are marked by a naive romanticism about the true complexity of human nature" as reflected in many self-help books available. That's an encouraging start, and the whole book is a thorough and systematic showing of the bases of the human psyche, prefixed by a short chapter on suffering (mainly unnecessary, mainly caused by people, and often by emotional damage in childhood). Part 2 goes through the various forms of psychosis and neurosis (Hardi man readmits 'mad' in place of mentally ill: well done!), and then there are chapters on emotional healing, changing ways of thinking and behav ing, and spiritual growth. He is weakest on bod ily health, which more and more we are discov ering to be intimately connected with mental health as both cause and effect. Who exactly this is for is the question. It appears to be for the pretty literate and intellectually capable, and makes no compromises to the sufferer, who might well be impatient of the systematic and balanced ap proach; that is to say it is not a therapeutic book per se. So is it for the armchair psychologist or for that most dangerous of animals, the amateur counsellor? **/*// Make Stress Work for You. Helen Gra ham. Gill &amp; Macmillan. 229 pp ?839 pb 0-7171 2598-X. This is much more the self-help book than Hardiman on 'Life's hurts' above, with sug gested self-applied therapies, exercises and ques tionnaires. The psychologist author runs self healing workshops and she has a balanced attitude to the contribution of food and exer cise?yes and humour and laughter. Each of these self-help books?whatever its focus?of fers sufficient good advice to make us fulfilled, useful and happy people. It's just a matter of finding the one that strikes a chord with you. Of course some people consume them all and are eager to tell their counsellors, therapists and psy chiatrists their business. A new malady perhaps: unhealthy introspection via a surfeit of self-help books? Myself, My Partner. Tony Humphreys. Gill &amp; Macmillan. 175 pp ?6.99 pb 0-7171-2616-1. Humphreys is the consultant phychologist who has published four very popular-level books on life skills, mainly on children and education, though his latest was on The Power of'Negative' Thinking and this one is about one-to-one or cou ple relationships. He fashionably avoids the words husband, wife and spouse, but that seems to be what he means by partner (since sexual gratification isn't normally one of the 'needs' of other sorts of partner). He's a great man for checklists and rows of 'bullet' points, and in this book indulges himself with verse (not quite po etry), which might and might not be helpful. From one we note that the current perception that feelings are always 'real' and so not to be sup pressed (surely a good and useful thing to pro claim) can be mystifyingly contrasted with "what's seen may not be there"?i.e. what's felt is always real, and what's seen isn't, which Dr Humphreys might find hard to defend. But gen erally there's good advice and help in analysing difficulties. * // PUBLIC SERVICE CPMR Discussion Papers : 1 Evaluating Public Expenditure Programmes.

Louis Hughes. Mer cier Press. 187pp?9.99pb 1-85635-172-6. This is a very serious and satisfyingly deep examination of yogic disciplines?including but not confined to those ostensibly Christian?by a Dominican priest who has studied new religious move ments, particularly those of Indian origin. How ever it is not by any means beyond the ordinary hundred-IQ reader. It's particularly good to see Tony Quinn's 'system' seriously considered, since this is very widely adhered to in Ireland and being populist and perhaps a bit simplistic (and near home) is sometimes not taken as seriously as it should be. Anthony de Mello's and the Hare Krishnas are other widely-known disciplines de scribed, and Bede Griffiths, who was convinced that "the world has need of both the eastern and the western visions of reality" is well represented among others we hadn't heard of.

An advantage of being a small country</page><page sequence="8">314 November 1997 BOOKS IRELAND is that you can have a single book magazine that can attempt to cover every publication, and a sin gle science magazine that brings together scien tists and technologists who are no doubt often enough quite ignorant of each other's disciplines much less achievements. We'd bet quite a lot that significant progress has resulted from cross-dis ciplinary reading of this annual and, as scientists individually get to know more and more about less and less, this is increasingly important. We should add that there's very little whiff of Public Relations or popularising about the reports and another benefit of the enterprise is that it forces people to describe their work succinctly and sim ply In effect it is a co-operative effort by the sci entists and institutions, since they pay to be in cluded. It is good value for them, as the annual is sent free to schools, TDs and others who ought to know what's going on. The 1994-95 volume is a co-binding of the three issues of what was until 1995 a more frequent and smaller magazine. We think the change to annual was surely a good decision. ** * SS SHORT STORIES If Only: short stories of love and divorce by Irish women writers, ed. Kate Cruise O'Brien and Mary Maher. Poolbeg. 318 pp ?7.99 pb 1 85371-751-7. Nineteen stories by as many women, who are all (we think) living ones. How strange to mark the introduction of divorce in Ireland with a collection of stories! It looks a first class one. + A sfc / A Love Present and other stories. John Montague. Wolfhound Press (USA: Irish Ameri can Book Company). 159 pp ?12.99 hb 0-86327 608-3. He's much better known as a poet, and we had forgotten The Death of a Chieftain and other stories (1964) and The Lost Notebook ('87). The latter was a novella about a highly-charged sex ual-and-artistic encounter, which our reviewer found rather embarrassingly intimate, as if he were trespassing in a private diary, but Hughes the book wholesalers gave it their first fiction award. Thus this collection spanning the seven ages of man might not be as prudish as some would like, though Montague is more mature? in fact he'll be a septuagenarian in a year and a bit. It's a neat little hardback with a clever jacket, and the first book we'd seen to carry the co-im print of the Irish American Book Company, which now seems to be common. +* A Jfcfc Three Storeys Up : tales of Dublin tene ment life.

It's not often we have books on science to review, and it is bitter indeed to receive this late (it appeared last spring) in the month when we actually run a review in which is could have featured.

Sports journalist Sweeney was a prenatal follower of Sligo Rovers, and this is a loving and amusing account of a football (soccer) team and one family of support ers. Incidentally he published his first novel, Waiting for the Healer, this spring, and after tick ing him off roundly in May for trying too hard to be funny, John Dunne admitted that it was well worth your time and effort, the word 'brilliant' actually occurring at least once.

This must be the umpty-umpth Flip'n'Flop book, with its slightly big print and fun pictures by Terry Myler and we suppose gen erations of Flip'n'Flop readers are now reading Dostoievsky. *+ // Great Irish Legends for Children. Yvonne Carroll; illus. Robin Lawrie. Gill &amp; Macmillan. 64 pp ?7.99 hb 28 x 21 cm 0-7171 2467-3. Six stories, including the king with don key's ears, the bull of Cooley, Eisirt etc. in pretty big type, set into full-page colourful pictures that children will enjoy, and with colourful laminated cover boards. Incidentally the typeface chosen is conventional roman but with the round a, g and (unsharp) \ which are more like the handwritten forms and so less confusing for children?at least supposedly, though since kids indevitably meet the conventional forms in print from their earliest years, it might be argued that this is only adding to their difficulties?like the pronunciation guide at the end that gives Far Dr-ka (!) for Fear Dorcha and will encourage little English children to say Tyre na Nogue and Fiayna. * -+&gt; A / It's a Jungle Out There. Ed Miliano. Wolf hound Press. 32 pp ?8.99 hb 27 x 21 cm 0-86327 570-2. A day in the life of the white cat you met on our cover last month, with clever pictures on every page of its adventures and challenges in a garden, and some hidden extras for children to look for. The glazed cover boards help bring it up to value?the price being a bit on the high side because this is Irish-originated and until and un less Wolfhound can sell copies (or translations) to overseas publishers or distributors it is quite a high-risk venture. There's every reason to hope they will sell it, as it's well up to international standards, and is not specifically Irish. Miliano, of Italian origin, has lived and worked here for some time, though we gather he's currently con quering the new world, whether or not perma V Library Bindings Ltd.

Elizabeth Shaw. O'Brien Press. 59 pp ?3.99 pb 0-86278-463-8. Panda 6. Reissue of a little classic that has been translated into six other languages, and was a bestseller in Japan. Biggish type with rounded o and g (but not y?see Great Irish Legends above). Sixes upwards will love it. + **&gt; A / The Slave Coast. Bill Wall. Mercier Press. 144 pp ?4.99 pb 1-85635-196-3. Sequel to The Powder Monkey. Young stowaway D?nal finds himself among pirates, sea battles and the slave trade?as well as friendships and the pleasures of seagoing. Particularly clever and attractive cover by Penhouse. ++ A ^/ Riverside: The Croke Park Conspiracy. Peter Regan. The Children's Press. 112 pp ?2.95 pb 1-901737-04-7. Second in a series about an un der-14 football with lots of action and irresistable chapter heads: Mrs O'Leary's Bombshell, Fish, An Explosive Affair, A Plot is Hatched, The Bub ble Bursts and so on. This time the Riverside Boys are up against?wait for it!?the GAA. Are Brains O'Mahony's ideas so good after all? And will Jimmy get his book published? ++ A Shak and the Beanstalk. Aislinn O'Loughlin. Wolfhound Press. 109 pp ?3.99 pb 0-86327-574-5. Quirky new version of the fairy tale, by a sixteen-year-old author. Shak is a black bird, and the giant has ambitions to be a stand-up comedian. Marie-Louise Fitzpatrick provides pen drawings. + Timber Twig. Kate McMahon. The Children's Press.l42pp?3.95pbl-901737-01-2. Afirst-class looking pony book from first-time author Kate McMahon who tells it well in the first person (girl not pony you idiot) and is an American-born farmer's wife and pony-person's mother out West?indeed Timber Twig (could he, would he outjump rich girl Kelly's thoroughbred?) is based on a real horse and Clare on a real daughter. Terry Myler gets the pictures exactly right. ** -+&gt; A ** // What Faust Saw. Matt Ottley. Wolfhound Press. 32 pp ?4.99 pb 21 x 28 cm (wide) 0-86327 603-2. If anyone wants to assess First-flush's sense of humour, here is its precise measure. We were alone when we opened it and we laughed out loud right through. It helps if you like large soppy dogs. A 6-year-old would enjoy it (missing a few subtleties but enjoying the extraterrestrials more than we did); a 66-year-old nearly fell of his chair as well as admiring the technique (unusual to see oils or possibly acrylics on canvas used for a child's book). Another slightly innovative tech nicality is the flexible use of type for the (mini mal) text. Here is computer typography used really well. The book originated in Australia, and we just hope we can export something equally funny to restore the import-export laughter defi cit. + #*/ When Jessie Came Across the Sea. Amy Hest; illus. P. J. Lynch. Poolbeg (Britain: Walker). 39 pp ?10.99 hb 25x28 cm (wtde) 1-85371-787-8. A tearfully-sentimental story of about a hundred years ago about a young Jewish girl (from some where in central Europe one assumes) who gets a ticket to America and finds romance there. It is very short and simply told, and the big colour pictures by Ireland's best-paid (and brilliant) il lustrator are more than half the point. We are so used to stories of Irish emigrants, it is very good to read of a Jewish family. * -&gt; A You're Safe Now, Waterdog. Richard Ed wards; illus. Sophy Williams. Wolfhound Press (Britain: Orion). 31 pp ?4.50 pb 24 x 24 cm 0 86327-605-9. A lovely picture story (there's a few lines of big type on each page) about a favourite toy that gets forgotten and then by chance finds a loving new owner. Sophy Williams uses the soft focus super-real style that is very fashionable for children's picture books?and very appealing (we think) to those who chiefly buy them, i.e. aunts, grandmothers and such. However if there's adult oo-ah appeal in the depiction of the children, we've no reason to think that children themselves will be less enchanted. Sophy clev erly lets the toy seem alive and happy, sad etc. as appropriate without in fact portraying it other wise than as a stuffed toy. Is that the art of fiction? To give us characters that the reader can imbue with life, rather than lifelike ones, so that reading is a participatory art? * / YOUNGEST PEOPLE Fireman Sinead! Anna Donovan; illus. Susan Cooper. O'Brien Press. 59 pp ?3.99 pb 0 86278-529-4. Panda 4. Another in the new-reader series. We just hope to heaven that it doesn't give some bright child the idea of putting a match to a waste-paper-basket. The illustrations are ex tremely simple, but we think they'll work for this age. * A Freddie gets dressed and Freddie visits the doctor. Nicola Smee. Bedtime Rhymes. Carol Thompson. O'Brien Press (Britain: Or chard Books), each 20 pp ?3.99 pb 21 x 21 cm 0 86278-535-9\ -536-7, -534-0. A new toddlers' se ries, with not much text in very big type?well-judged stories and good rhymes? and nice colour pictures all on pages you would call card rather than paper. Irish children might be curious why one of the children illustrated in the rhymes book is dark-skinned, but there! Irish children have more to learn than some. * / Muckeen the Pig. Fergus Lyons. O'Brien Press. 51 pp ?3.99 pb 0-86278-528-6. Panda 1. First of a new series for beginner readers: see four others in this section. An amusing story about a pig, that strangely fosters the notion among chil dren that farmers have reserves of?gold! + No Shoes for Tom! Una Leavy; illus. Mar garet Suggs. O'Brien Press. 57 pp ?3.99 pb 0 86278-526-X. Panda 2. Another first reader in the new series, about a naughty boy. There's a Panda hidden in each book, and this column had some difficulty in finding each of them (if seemed im portant at the time). The secret is they're very small, and whether a child of first-reading age could easily adjust his scaling ability to find them we're a bit unsure. + A / Ribbit Ribbit! Anne Marie Herron; illus. Stephen Hall. O'Brien Press. 64 pp ?3.99 pb 0 86278-527-8. Panda 3. This one is a good story about a little boy who insists on being a frog, and how he gets cured. One of our grandsons was a cat for a while, so we know the problem. The pictures are a bit wild and sophisticated for this age, possibly? * A / the complete: pre press book service From word processor to disk, to final single or full colour film, - single page or planned - effortlessly and professionally. &amp; All illustrations, maps, and photographs included in formatted text and proofed to the ultimate in modern standards. &amp; Sendfull details for estimate to: Tony Moreau Tel. &amp; Fax.
