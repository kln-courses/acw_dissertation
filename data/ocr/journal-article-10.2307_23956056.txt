'Rhema' in der Septuaginta. By Eero Repo. Pp. 204. Helsinki, 1951. Although the relative usage of rhema and logos in the LXX reflects the decreasing use of rhema in classical Greek, yet the LXX lags behind, that is to say, rhema is used rather more frequently than might be expected. This painstaking study seeks to resolve this problem. The author finds the solution in a combination of several different influences. He finds that both Aquila and Theodotion show a tendency to use rhema a little more frequently than the LXX, and points to the Palestin ian-Aramaic background of those translations as accounting for it. The same kind of background, particularly the Aramaic influence, is to be seen in the translations of Job, Ezra, and Daniel in the LXX which show a greater frequency of rhema over logos than some other parts of LXX. The association of the use of rhema with an Aramaic-speaking milieu is assisted by the fact that similarity of sound seems to have played some part in the choice of rhema, since it is homophonous with some of the forms of transliteration into Greek of derivatives of 'amar. Repo further attempts to relate rhema and logos to particular shades of meaning, claiming that rhema, having strong affinities with Hebrew and Aramaic, has a tendency to reflect the concrete, the actual word or words uttered, whereas logos, from its Greek background, bears a more abstract meaning: rhema 'betont die mundliche Ausserung der Gesetzes gebote', logos 'seinerseits deren Inhalt' (p. 138). The material is well handled and clearly set out, but the arguments seem at times to be pressed too far. For example, the use of memra to translate yadh, 'hand', in the Targum is comparatively rare and should not therefore be claimed to substantiate a dynamic use of memra (p. 77). Again, the use of rhema in Isa. 55×´ and Hos. 65 is extremely slender evidence on which to base the conclusion that rhema equally with logos was capable of representing the creative word (p. 171). The present reviewer misses a recognition of the developing theologi cal use of logos which would perhaps explain why rhema and not logos was used to translate pe, 'mouth', in several instances. Logos with its more specialized dynamic meaning would not lend itself to an idea so concrete and anthropomorphic (cf. p. 133). Further, more attention should probably be paid to the oral use of Greek Targums in the synagogues. Such a practice is mentioned in a footnote to p. 31 but could be given more weight as contributing to the apparent 'Aramaic' tendency in the use of rhema.</page></plain_text>
