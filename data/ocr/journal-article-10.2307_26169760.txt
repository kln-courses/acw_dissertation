<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Embodying Otherness: Shape- Shifting and the Natural World Drew Leder Philosophy Department, Loyola University Maryland, 4501 North Charles Street,  Baltimore, MD 21210; dleder@loyola.edu This paper explores the ability and desire of the embodied self to “shape-shift”—to  experience from within the capacities of animals, or natural phenomena like trees  and mountains. Shape-shifting is discussed insofar as it manifests in a broad range  of cultural domains, including children’s play, mythico-religious iconography, spiritual  practice, sports, the performing arts, and so on. This potential for shape-shifting is  grounded not simply in our evolutionary history and biological kinships, but in the  phenomenology of the lived-body. Our own powers are explored, expanded, and  transformed through our communion with the non-human world. Openings A child, pretending to be a cat, makes claw-fingers and lets loose a  threatening hiss. A yogi, arching his back, lifting and opening his chest,  assumes the cobra pose (bhjangasana). Donning a deer head, a young  man readies to participate in the deer dance, a reenactment of the  hunt traditional to the Yaqui tribe of Northern Mexico and Arizona.  An American football player pulls on his helmet emblazoned with a  Bronco, symbolizing skill and speed. A dancer assumes the role of a  graceful swan. A meditator sits in full lotus posture (padmasana), letting  her body and consciousness ground and open.   What do these diverse performances have in common? They  involve a kind of shape-shifting in which the human body incorporates  elements of the natural world. This may be accomplished through  imitation, implication, and imagination, but is never purely notional.  Shape-shifting is a carnal gesture and trans-formation. The human  body longs to open beyond itself—to explore, play with, learn from,  and internalize the myriad non-human bodies it encounters. We witness  an eagle soaring overhead or the fierceness of a wolf, a floating cloud  or steadfast boulder. Such entities seem to embody different forms of  skill and awareness. We are mystified, companioned, intrigued by their  presence. We long to experience such styles of being from within.  This paper will explore the cultural import of human-natural  “shape-shifting.” Examples will be given from child development,  Environmental Philosophy 9 (2), 123–141.

As  befits this topic, we will see that shape-shifting as a phenomenon can  transform and disguise itself, such that it becomes easy to overlook or  devalue. Yet we do so at our peril. Our human body, lived fully, is ever  protean, open to inspiration from the more-than-human world.   Beginnings I will not theorize about the “origins” of such human-nature shape- shifting. Postulations of an originary moment or structure tend to be  conjectural and univocal in a troubling way. However, we can begin by  inquiring into some of the ways in which shape-shifting itself can be  said to begin. For the individual we see it leap forth first in childhood play and  exploration. In the swaying of trees in the breeze, the opening of a  flower, the child encounters styles of movement that seem to echo and  call forth her own mood and gestures. Looking into the eyes of a pet  cat, the child encounters a gaze no less piercing than that of her younger  brother. Yet the cat body is alluringly strange even in its familiarity.  What is it like to arch one’s back, scamper across a room, hiss, and  purr? Only one way to know: turning arms into forelegs, dropping to  the earth, swishing her bottom, she becomes a child/cat, transformed  through performance. Possibilities are explored, lessons learned, joys  heightened. (For example, as a young boy I discovered it would greatly  enhance the pleasure of a morsel of cheese if I nibbled it like a mouse,  clutching it in my hand-paws.)   The boundary between human and non-human, even animal and  plant, living and non-living, inner and outer, is porous in the child’s  world, allowing for an ease of shape-shifting that is salutary. Philosopher  Arne Naess calls the “deep ecology” movement that he helped found  “largely an articulation of the implicit philosophy of 5 year old children  who have access to at least a minimum of animals, plants, and natural  places. These children experience animals as beings like themselves in  basic respects. They have joys and sorrows, interests, needs, loves and  hates. Even flowers and places are alive to them, thriving or having a  bad time” (1984, 180). We see this not only in imitative play, but in children’s toys and  entertainment. A cuddled teddy bear, as its name suggests, is toy, bear,  and person, all. Books and movies overflow with animal protagonists— talking bunnies, mice, dogs, pigs, bears—who have anthropomorphic  features (Mickey Mouse was, over time, made less to look like a rodent,  and more like a baby). The child vicariously delights in these interspecies  transgressions. Animation, particularly congenial to such conjurings,  keeps alive in our mechanized culture the ancient spirit of animism—a  </page> <page sequence="3"> Embodying Otherness: Shape-shifting and the Natural World 125 world-view in which everything is alive, aware, and intertwined (Abram  1983).  Hence, the popularity of such “performers” as Bugs Bunny, the  Lion King, and Winnie the Pooh, to name but a few.  “Beginnings”—the theme of this section—can be understood not  just developmentally, but historically and anthropologically. Our  conjectures threaten to collapse into the mists of pre-history, but it may  be telling that much of the first artwork we have, such as the Paleolithic  cave paintings of Lascaux, France, or the even-older paintings of the  recently discovered Chauvet cave (Chauvet, Dechamps, and Hillaire,  1996) are of large animals—stags, rhinoceroses, horses, bear, cattle,  bison, and so on. The exact use and meanings of such paintings is  unknown, but Schechner (2002, 221–225) surmises they may have  been embedded in a context of ritual performance—dancing, singing— perhaps related to hunting or fertility. The portrayal and performance  of animals seem to have been central to the arising of the human arts.  Concerning “beginnings,” we also see animal/human blendings  reflected in the creation stories of indigenous peoples. These, the world  over, often refer to some variation of “First Beings” who make or repair  the world. As Mason writes,  Whatever the origins of the land and seas, the First Beings in them  are invariably animals. Typically they are animals with human  abilities . . . and in many cultures they are the ancestors of human  beings. Generally, this first being is the most wily and intelligent  animal in the tribal area. Among North American peoples, it is the  mink, raven, or bluejay in the Northwest; in the Plains, it is the coyote  or grandmother spider; in the Northeast, it is the white arctic hare.  (1993, 108–109) When humans come into the world they are taught to make fire,  tools, and clothing, and to perform the proper rituals by these animal  ancestors.  This sense of an embodied relation to animals remains central in  many indigenous cultures, invoked by story, dance, and ritual. Tribes  may have an affiliation with a totem animal establishing group identity  and exemplifying certain modes of power and protection. Animals  often have keen senses, as well as instincts, strength, and skills, that  surpass those of the ordinary person; character traits, such as courage  (as in our expression, “brave as a lion”), industriousness (“busy as a  bee”), or wisdom (“wise as an owl”) that we do well to emulate; and  powers both natural and spiritual—like the soaring of a bird in flight— that far transcend, yet can infiltrate and inspire our paltry earth-bound  self. The beaver shows us how to dam; the wolf, how to track in packs,  and pounce; the fox, which fruits are edible, which poisonous; and so  on. For the vast majority of our existence humans have been hunter- </page> <page sequence="4"> 126 Drew Leder gatherers, co-inhabiting the land with other species who have taught  us much. Perhaps most importantly, we have learned about hunting not only  by imitating the skills of the predator, but through studying the ways of  our prey. To track an animal one needs to embody it from within, coming  to know when it will emerge from hiding, where its hunger would  lead it,  what it will see and smell from its vantage point. This takes  sensitivity cultivated through study, training, and performance. Lawlor  writes about Australian aboriginal culture:  The most powerful hunters are also spectacular dancers and  singers who can imitate the movements and sounds of animals and  birds . . . [These are] employed as lures and decoys during the hunt.  The intelligence and sensibilities of the animal become alive within the  consciousness of the hunter and his kin. In this way, the quarry first becomes  part of the hunter in spirit before becoming part of him in flesh. (1991, 302–303)   In every culture, there are performers who excel in this art of shape- shifting. This underlies not only of the hunter’s skill but the powers of  the shaman, who dwells on the border between human culture and wild  nature (Duerr, 1985; Abram 2002, 2010). Abram, a phenomenologist  who is also a sleight-of-hand magician, used his talents to gain the  confidence of traditional shamans in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Nepal.  He discovered that in their healing work they were not so much traveling  to a supernatural realm, as is often described by Western observers, but  were communing with the natural powers in which the human world is  embedded.  One Nepalese magician, Sonam, trained Abram to become  fiercely attentive to ravens, not simply as perceptual objects but until  he could “feel the experience of meeting up with myself inside the bird”  (2010, 244). Sonam was himself so expert at merging with ravens that  one day he startles Abram by appearing to him as a raven—then seeming  to reassume his human form. (Abram uses phenomenological tools to  try to make sense of this mystifying experience.) I quote at length a  valuable summary statement:     Learning to dance another animal is central to the craft of shamanic  traditions throughout the world. To move as another is simply the  most visceral approach to feel one’s way into the body of that creature,  and so to taste the flavor of its experience, entering into the felt  intelligence of the other. I have witnessed a young medicine person in  the American Southwest summon the spirit of a deer by dancing that  animal, have watched a Kwakiutl magician shuffle and dip his way  into the power of a black bear, have seen a native healer dream her  body into the riverdance of a spawning salmon, and a Mayan shaman  contort himself into the rapid, vibratory flight of a dragonfly. In every  case, a subtle change came upon the dancer as she gave herself over  </page> <page sequence="5"> Embodying Otherness: Shape-shifting and the Natural World 127 to the animal and so let herself be possessed, raising goose bumps  along my skin as I watched. The carefully articulated movements,  and the stylized but eerily precise renderings of the other’s behavior,  were clearly the fruit of long, patient observation of the animal other,  steadily inviting its alien gestures into one’s muscles. The dancer feels  her way into the subjective experience of the other by mimicking its  patterned movements, and so invoking it, coaxing it close, drawing it  into her flesh with subtlest motion of a shoulder, or a hip, or a blinking  eye. . . . Merely calling to the creature in one’s imagination will never  suffice; one must summon it bodily, entering mimetically into the  shape and rhythm of the other being if the animal spirit is to feel the  call. (2010, 238–239)   This art of shape-shifting undermines and outruns Western dualisms of  body and spirit, earth and the other-worldly, nature and culture, animal  and human.  Sacred Performance  Shape-shift blendings of human-natural forms are central not only  within shamanistic practice, but many sacred traditions of Western and  Eastern “high culture.” Ancient Greek deities such as Zeus, god of sky  and thunder, and Poseidon, god of the sea, embody natural powers,  and some can assume animal form, as when Zeus takes on the body  of a bull or swan to effect his seductions. This mythological world  is also filled with river and forest nymphs, chimera and griffins, and  half-human half-animal centaurs and satyrs. The last were particularly  associated with the god Dionysus, whose Bacchanalian rites formed  one of the sources of Greek theatre. It led most directly to the satyr  play, a tragicomic genre featuring a chorus of these bawdy figures, half  men-half goat or horse, played by actors in animalistic  masks. This  interspecies shape-shifting allowed performers and audience alike to  sympathetically explore themes of “bestial” drunkenness, sexuality, and  humor (Griffith 2002). Turning toward Asia, we see the blending of god /human/animal  forms within Hinduism. Its divinities are accompanied and empowered  by an animal consort. For example, Saraswati, goddess of wisdom,  language, and the arts, is portrayed as a beautiful many-armed woman  riding atop a white swan (hamsa). The swan represents purity and  spiritual discernment, the renunciates’s ability to soar free of worldly  temptation (Feuerstein 1997, 114–115, 261; Vanamali 2006, 207–215).  Saraswati and swan together embody the divine energies that lift us to  spiritual heights. There are also Hindu deities who themselves have animal forms,  like the elephant-headed Ganesh, powerful enough to remove all  obstacles, and Hanuman, the monkey-god who plays a central role in the  </page> <page sequence="6"> 128 Drew Leder Ramayana. Hanuman, a fierce warrior, healer, and devotee of Ram—yet  with a simian spirit of mischief—is worshipped in temples, the subject  of many stories, and honored through monumental statues (Lutgendorf  1994). He is also a popular character in the masked and shadow-puppet  versions of the Ramayana performed in India and Southeast Asia.  Sacred performance, in the broad sense, is not confined to temple  or stage, but also enacted in the bodily practices of devotees. Well- known in the West is the Hindu hatha yoga tradition of working with  asanas (poses), many named for and adapted from animals including,  for example, the fish, cobra, frog, lion, eagle, and dog poses. According  to legend ancient yogis living in the forests were able to observe how  animals stretched and invigorated themselves, rested and healed, and  they designed yoga poses in imitation. Some asanas also reflect other  natural, though non-animal, inspirations. When assuming the tree pose  (vriksasana), a personal favorite, I experience a bit of the solidity and  flexibility that keeps a tree rooted even in a blustery wind. Mountain  pose (tadasana) allows the yogi to experience being grounded even  while stretching toward the heavens.  This human-natural shape-shifting finds expression not only in  outward postures but “inner” alignments of breath and awareness  (Leder 2004). A Hindu teaching, dating back to Upanishads such as  the Mundaka (Swami Nikilananda 1963, 114), is that you can realize  Brahman (the unlimited Divine) by entering the “cave of the heart”  (Feuerstein 1997, 110, 126). Traditionally, seers (rishis) meditated in  caves at the foothills of the Himalayas. One can conjecture that over  time they learned to interiorize the mountain-stillness, the womblike  depth of the cave, until these outer forms became embodied within as a  place of meditative focus and revelation.  To take another, personal, example, I frequently utilize the mantra  “hamsa” breathed in and out through the “heart center” (Leder 2004,  58–60). Also referred to in the Upanishads, this sacred sound embodies  many significances (Feuerstein,1997, 115–16; Muktananda 1992). It is  said to be a contraction of “aham sa,” (“I am that”), referring to the unity  of Self and All that is experienced when breath-energy (prana) enters,  circulates, and is released.  “Ham-sa” is also said to be the natural sound  of the breath’s inhalation then exhalation, such that we repeat this  “unvoiced” mantra thousands of times a day, know it or not. Finally, as  mentioned above, hamsa refers to a “swan,” or more accurately the “wild  goose” that migrates high in Indian skies, symbolizing the transcendent  Self and the samnyasin (renunciate) who abandons the world to find it.  When meditating on hamsa, I sometimes visualize this inner swan/goose  soaring toward the sun, each breath a flap of its graceful wings, or else  resting placidly on a calm pond.     </page> <page sequence="7"> Embodying Otherness: Shape-shifting and the Natural World 129 Switching traditions, and exchanging seated meditation for  movement, I also perform in a low-level way Crane-style chi kung (qigong)  that I learned in a class. Flowering from an ancient Taoist and Buddhist  tradition, and practiced extensively to this day in China, chi kung involves  gentle movement and breathing exercises designed to preserve health,  energy, flexibility, and tranquility through circulating ch’i (qi), vital  energy (Jahnke 2002). In a flow of five movement-sequences I enact my  crane-body, stretching upward to the sky; spreading my wings; flexing  my long neck.  Chi kung is closely related to t’ai chi ch’uan (or tai chi), a movement  practice that can be considered as martial art, dance-form, exercise, and  meditation. According to legend, tai chi was invented by a 15th century  monk, Chang San-feng, who witnessed a fight between a bird and a  snake. He saw how the soft and yielding often overcomes the hard and  inflexible: wherever the bird attacked, the snake was able to yield and  thereby avoid being killed. Creaturely inspiration is present in many tai  chi forms.  These include, to name a few, Snake Creeps Down; Winds  Sweeps the Plum Blossoms; White Crane Spreads Wings; Lion Shakes  its Head; Embrace Tiger, Return to Mountain; Wild Horse Leaps the  Ravine; Golden Cock Stands on One Leg; and Swallow Skims the  Water. One classic text describes the tai chi martial artist’s moves as such: The ward-off arm is extended at an angle like the crescent moon. . . . The hand is like a deer looking backward. . . . Push is employed like a tiger pouncing on a sheep;  Waist, legs, arms and hands perfectly coordinated. . . . Pull-down is like a monkey plucking peaches; After sinking, grasp obliquely, enticing the opponent to steal. (Wile  1994, 52–53)     The master’s body is thus in-formed by inspirations from the natural  world.  Such shape-shifting is also central to East Asian art. For example, in  Chinese brush painting, when seeking to portray flower, mountain, or  river properly, it is recommended that you contemplate them with such  depth of attention that they penetrate your heart/mind allowing you to  express them from within. To paint a bird properly involves becoming  one with the bird without losing your human artistry. Once we look for it, we discover sacred shape-shifting even in  unexpected places.  For example, the Buddha is often seen as having  withdrawn in solitary meditation from the world of suffering. Yet he  remained connected to the natural world, achieving enlightenment  after sitting all night beneath the Bodhi tree (a Pipal, or banyan fig),  and touching the earth to proclaim his awakening. Then, in Narada  Mahathera’s words, “As a mark of profound gratitude to the inanimate  </page> <page sequence="8"> 130 Drew Leder Bodhi tree that sheltered Him during His struggle for enlightenment,  He stood at a certain distance gazing at the tree with motionless eyes  for one whole week. Following His example, His followers in memory  of His enlightenment still venerate not only the original Bodhi tree but  also its descendants” (2006, 32–33). According to folklore, since the  Buddha has the power to produce rain, the Bodhi tree is now endowed  with similar magic powers.  We might think of this as a symbolic way of saying that the body/ mind of the Buddha and tree have interfused. The once restless prince  Siddhartha has learned to sit with still body and mind quiet, finally  resolving all the insufficiencies and cravings of human/animal life.  Immobile yet flexible, rooted yet receptive, connected to the nurturing  energies of the universe, Buddha now embodies the being of a tree  integrated with an elevated human consciousness.  Returning to the West, an echo of shamanic shape-shifting may  also be present in the Christian tradition. When a priestly representative  offers bread, intoning the words from the Last Supper, “this is my body  which will be given up for you,” and offering wine as Jesus’ blood,  the ritual performance invokes a mysterious transformation. While  supernatural in significance, it is rooted in natural relations. Our body  is sustained by, and akin to, bread; our red blood looks and flows like  wine. The things of nature mysteriously pass into us, turn into us, gift  us with our life. In the Eucharist, this “ordinary” shape-shifting serves  as a ritual incarnation of God’s extraordinary love.  Secular Performances  We have surveyed the role of human-nature shape-shifting in many  “sacred” performances: shamanic healings, Dionysian theatre, yoga, tai  chi, meditation and worship. Yet, we can say that shape-shifting is no  less present in the “secular” world, while acknowledging this division of  worlds is itself provisional, problematic, and porous. To start with a superficial example (from the Latin superficialis—“of  or pertaining to the surface”), consider shape-shifting presences in the  fashion world. Through clothing, which alters the face of the body  turned outward, we can transform our appearance and identity—and in  ways that may be inspired by the natural world. The young woman dons  a leopard-print dress; the motorcycle gang member rides in a leather  jacket; the aging matron wraps herself in a mink stole: how alluring to  put on a real or imitative animal skin, embodying qualities—sexuality,  toughness, elegance—associated with these creatures. Warranted  criticism of the cruel factory-farm system that produces some of these  skins should not blind us to the primal, quasi-shamanistic urge that lies  beneath. </page> <page sequence="9"> Embodying Otherness: Shape-shifting and the Natural World 131 We find this in the sports world as well. Various animals embody  qualities, more superhuman than subhuman, that athletes strain  to achieve, operating at the very limits of human performance. For  example, in American football, an aggressively violent but sometimes  strangely beautiful game, some fifteen of the thirty-two teams assume  animal identities. These are represented in the team names and mascots,  the color and design of their jerseys, and the images emblazoned on  their helmets, such that the players take the field as interspecies hybrids.  The National Football League boasts five birds—the Falcons, Cardinals,  Seahawks, Ravens, and Eagles—honoring, perhaps, the prominence of  the aerial pass in football. Representing the ferocity of the hunt are  Lions, Panthers, Bengals, and Jaguars. Three teams are named after  horses, swift and powerful, like football halfbacks and receivers: the  Colts, Chargers, and Broncos. Then there are the Rams and Bears (try  to tackle one of these creatures on the open field) and, as a gesture to  bioregionalism, one sea-dwelling creature, the Miami Dolphins.  (My  own city’s representative, the Baltimore Ravens, has the distinction  of being the only football team named from a poem—hometown boy  Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven.”) These athletes are like modern hunter/ shamans incorporating the powers of wild creatures.   Shape-shifting also shines forth in the performing arts. Earlier we  referred to the intertwining of theatre with religion and ritual, as in the  Dionysian satyr play or the shadow puppetry of the Ramayana. One of  the inspirations behind this paper is a Yale Repertory production of  Ovid’s Metamorphoses that I saw as a teenager, directed by Paul Sills. I  still remember the enchantment produced when Philemon and Baucis,  an elderly couple who have been hospitable to the gods, are rewarded  by being transformed into two trees, oak and linden, their trunks and  branches forever intertwined. As the actors embraced, merging into one  another and the earth, the effect on stage was magical.  Western theatre, however, has often tilted toward an anthropocentric  focus. A number of reasons for this can be adduced. Performance stages  increasingly became human constructions, set off from the natural  world. On stage, humans usually interacted primarily with one another.  While elements of nature remain key framing devices—in Shakespeare,  for example, think of King Lear’s stormy heath, the woods of Elsinore in  Macbeth, or the wild settings and creatures of The Tempest and A Midsummer  Night’s Dream—drama largely focuses on human character development  and interactions. (See Chaudhuri 2007, for the rare counter-example  wherein animals play a central dramatic role.) Even “higher animals,”  while trainable for performance, cannot deliver dialogue as humans  do, nor “act” in the full-fledged sense—that is, understand they  are portraying a fictional character and conjure a “seeming” world  independent of reality.  </page> <page sequence="10"> 132 Drew Leder However, human-animal shape-shifting remains alive and well,  particularly within certain genres. In dance—most famously, Swan  Lake—the choreographer and performers take up the shamanic role of  dancing to life the body and spirit of the creature. Costuming, balletic  leaping, the graceful and sinuous use of limbs, torso, head and neck, all  combine to create the woman-birds who populate the ballet.   We also find this art alive and well in musicals, with their elaborate  and fanciful costuming, sets, and special effects.  Think of Cats, a strange  transmogrification of T.S. Eliot poems featuring dozens of human- felines; Disney’s Lion King, with its African-inspired animal costumes  and puppets; Beauty and the Beast, exploring magical shape-shiftings  between the human and bestial, animate and inanimate; Shrek, with its  talking donkey and human-ogre shape-shifting; Spiderman, featuring a  flying superhero infected with arachnoid powers. As “family musicals,”  these are designed to appeal to children who, as we discussed, are closer  to the animistic worldview wherein humans and animals blend and  exchange identities. These productions are also closely related to, and  often drawn from, the world of film. “Movies,” based on a perceptual illusion of movement, can  create magical dream-worlds using lighting, costume, music, acting,  cinematography, editing, and special effects.  To take a few recent  (hugely popular) examples, the Batman trilogy showcases a hero whose  noble attributes merge with the sinister-nocturnal aspects of his totem  creature; the Twilight films feature “werewolves” (or, more precisely,  descendants of shape-shifting Spirit Warriors of the Quileute tribe);  Avatar explores the indigenous “Na’vi” people, both humanoid and  animal-like, and their ways of merging with other life-energies on the  planet Pandora. This film also explores shape-shifting as technologically- mediated: hero, Jake Sully, via a computerized linkage, is able to move  and sense remotely through a Na’vi body, or “avatar.” We see here a  futuristic version of the ancient art of embodied merger. This can also  serve as a meta-commentary on the art of film itself: after all, through  advanced technology, a master showman-shaman like director James  Cameron vicariously transports the movie-viewer into another body  and world. The primordial art of shape-shifting is renewed through  twenty-first century computer graphics. While easy to dismiss as popular entertainment, the global impact  of these films should not be overlooked. Of the top twenty grossing  movies of all time, nineteen of them (the sole exception being Titanic)  take viewers into worlds redolent with shape-shifting, including Avatar,  Toy Story III, Alice in Wonderland, The Avengers, the Lord of the Rings films, the  Pirates of the Caribbean series, and the Harry Potter movies.  The box office results of these global entertainments remind us  that human-nature shape-shifting remains a powerful presence in the  </page> <page sequence="11"> Embodying Otherness: Shape-shifting and the Natural World 133 contemporary, as the archaic, world. “Performance,” Schechner writes,  “must be construed as a ‘broad spectrum’ or ‘continuum” of human  action ranging from ritual, play, sports, popular entertainments, the  performing arts (theatre, dance, music), and everyday life performances  to the enactment of social, professional, gender, race, and class roles,  and to healing (from shamanism to surgery), the media, and the  internet” (2002, 2). We have briefly suggested ways in which shape- shifting manifests across this broad array of performances, including,  on Schechner’s list, ritual, play, sports, entertainments, the performing  arts, social roles, and healing.     Kinship and Alterity  Yet this leads to a series of more foundational questions. From what  sources does this call to shape-shift arise? What, if anything, is its telos?  Why is shape-shifting such a persistent urge, and how is it significant to  our humanity and sociality? I will begin by discussing various modes  of kinship that link us to other natural entities, later turning to modes of  alluring alterity.     First, we share and are nourished by a material kinship with the  earth and all that inhabits it. We are made of the same fundamental  stuff, ancient elements often created and cast off by supernovae, now  ingredient in our solar system and planet. Our bodies thus resonate  with the world around us. Our bones are stony, stiffened by calcium.  Our blood is like sea water, with many of the same electrolytes flowing  through our veins. Our life is dependent on ceaseless exchanges with  the environment as we breathe, eat, and drink in the world. We inhale  the oxygen that trees exhale as waste, chew a carrot or piece of chicken,  and through the magic of the visceral body shape-shift it into human  flesh (Leder 1990, 36–68). In the words of Wang Yang-ming, sixteenth  century neo-Confucian philosopher: “Wind, rain, dew, thunder, sun  and moon, stars, animals and plants, mountains and rivers, earth and  stones are essentially of one body with man. It is for this reason that  such things as the grains and animals can nourish man and that such  things as medicine and minerals can heal diseases. Since they share the  same material force (ch’i), they enter into one another” (1963, 222). Switching to the framework of contemporary evolutionary theory,  the famous biologist Edward O. Wilson hypothesizes that, through our  millions of years of living in natural settings, particularly the savannahs  of Africa, humans have evolved an adaptive “biophilia.”  Etymologically  meaning the “love of life,” Wilson  defines “biophilia” as “the innate  tendency to focus on life and lifelike processes” (1984, 1) or “the innately  emotional affiliation of human beings to other living organisms” (1993,  31). It is not, he suggests, a single instinct but a complex of learning  rules that are mediated by cultural training, and includes within it  </page> <page sequence="12"> 134 Drew Leder instinctive biophobias, as humans often have for snakes. (After all,  other life-forms can threaten as well as nourish us.) While his notion is  controversial, research studies (Ulrich 1993) have suggested a human  affinity for certain natural features and landscapes that trigger positive  emotional states, lessen stress, promote wellness, and perhaps assist  creative and higher-order cognition. Our urge to shape-shift with the  natural world may be one expression of this “biophilia.”   Our kinship with the natural world, material and evolutionary, is  particularly close with animals. We share similarities on the level of  visceral, musculoskeletal, and sensory organs. We are kin even to lizard  and fly, in that they too have eyes, seek food, and are vulnerable to  danger. We cannot follow the bird in flight but can flap our arms like  wings, or seek a high-up “bird’s-eye-view.” In Aristotle’s (1941) language  we share with these creatures an “animal soul,” in that we perceive,  desire, and move to fulfill our ends. We have special homologies with  other mammals. Like a lion or lemur we are warm-blooded, have four  limbs, birth and nurse our young, and know what it is to climb to a  height, survey a landscape, feel the wind in our face.   Our kinship is thus not only material and evolutionary, but experiential.  This, of course, is a controversial claim. Philosophers, such as Nagel  (1974) in his famous article, “What is it Like to Be a Bat?”, have at  times disputed that we can know anything of the subjective experience  of other species. But other philosophers have asserted, rightly I believe,  that there are also profound commonalities of experience that allow us  to commune with one another (Abram 2010; Mazis, 2008; Acampora  2006; Derrida 2008). Kinship is not identity. There is also difference and alterity in these  cross-species encounters. Of course, this is true with other humans as  well. I cannot truly know what it is like to be quadriplegic, or to be  an aboriginal tribesman with a cultural training very different from my  own. Yet even here we would have things in common, for example, a  capacity to feel pain, or to use language. Our resonance with other animal-bodies also ranges across a  continuum of kinship and alterity. I know little about what it’s like to  be a clam. Its bodily constitution and life-world are extremely different  from mine. On the other end of the spectrum I share much with my  dog, like me a four-limbed mammal, and one of a species that has been  bred over thousands of years for compatibility with humans (Grandin  2004). (That is, the canine, too, has been literally shape-shifted to  assimilate human-like modes of perception and behavior.) We together  enjoy the rush of activity and sudden expansion of space when we exit  the house; race each other in our favorite field; then grow hot and tired  from this scampering, dragging our tails home to flop down, delighted,  in the air-conditioning.   </page> <page sequence="13"> Embodying Otherness: Shape-shifting and the Natural World 135 There is still alterity even in the midst of this kinship. I will never  understand the world of intricate smells that she tracks with her over  200 million olfactory receptors (I have but a paltry five million), and  she will never fully grasp the speech and thought I produce with my  hypertrophied forebrain. Still, as Acampora writes, “though there are  deep phenomenological differences between distinct kinds of animals,  these do not constitute an absolute existential divide—for instance, they  do not hermeneutically preclude communicative interrelationships”  (2006, 86). She understands my facial expressions and inflections, my  simple words, like go! and stay!—and I understand when she is telling  me walk-time! with her play posture and wagging tail (Horowitz 2010;  Sanders 1999). She, as I, participates in a carnal intentionality directed  toward the world, and a gestural language of sound and movement  through which we connect. At the same time, alterity adds alluring  mystery to our relation. What does she mean when she looks deeply  into my eyes? Why did she choose just that bush to pee on? What  would she do if she actually caught a squirrel? The fact that she cannot  answer in human speech makes her style of being-in-the-world more,  not less, fascinating. Twentieth-century phenomenologists such as Straus (1963) and  Merleau-Ponty (1962) have given us a framework to help explore  interspecies relations. Renouncing the “logocentric” dualism that has  been prevalent in the West—the assumption that a human is foremost  a rational mind or soul tethered to a material body—they explore how  our perception, movement, experience of space and time, even our  language and thought, are profoundly embodied (Leder 1990). We are  not solitary minds, as per Descartes, having to infer the existence of  an external world and other consciousnesses. Rather our lived-body  always pre-reflectively finds itself embedded in a life-world that we  inhabit with other embodied subjects.  In Merleau-Ponty’s words:  “It is precisely my body which  perceives the body of another person, and discovers in that other body  a miraculous prolongation of my own intentions, a familiar way of  dealing with the world. Henceforth, as the parts of my body together  comprise a system, so my body and the other person’s are one whole,  two sides of one and the same phenomenon” (1962, 354). The laughter  or tears of another elicits my own by empathic resonance. I follow the  gaze of a companion to discover what she is looking at. That which my  friends desire or scorn I usually learn to as well, absorbing their stance  on the world.  I am part of an embodied circuit of co-subjectivities.    Most Continental philosophers, Merleau-Ponty included, have  focused on human-to-human sociality. Derrida, in The Animal that  Therefore I Am, particularly critiques Descartes, Kant, Heidegger, Lacan,  and Levinas, for this resolute anthropocentrism: “The experience of the  </page> <page sequence="14"> 136 Drew Leder seeing animal, of the animal that looks at them, has not been taken  into account in the philosophical or theoretical architecture of their  discourse. In sum they have denied it as much as misunderstood it”  (2008, 14). Yet there are hints in Merleau-Ponty of how one might expand his  phenomenology of the lived body to include cross-species relations.  “There is a kinship between the being of the earth and that of my body  (Leib)” he writes, and “This kinship extends to others, who appear to  me as other bodies, to animals whom I understand as variants of my  embodiment, and finally even to terrestrial bodies since I introduce  them into the society of living bodies when saying, for example, that a  stone flies” (1988, 190). We might call animals in particular the other others who, no less than  human others, call out for existential and moral recognition.  Not only  we have faces, but so do dogs, cats, birds, wild animals, all of whom  gaze upon us, and gaze with us upon the world. We dwell with them in an  embodied relation that Acampora (2006) variously terms “transpecific  intersomaticity”; ”symphysis”; and “humaninimal conviviality.” Other  animals offer us not only companionship, but an embodied style which,  both through its kinship and alterity, suggests to us new possibilities,  pleasures, and powers. Hence, me as a child nibbling cheese like a  mouse; the shaman studying, and embodying, the ways of the raven;  the hunter dancing the deer; the ballerina dancing the swan; the yogi  assuming the cobra pose; and on and on, in our intersomaticity.  Nor is this restricted only to our encounters with animals. In the  quote above Merleau-Ponty notes that even terrestrial bodies can be  experienced as alive. We have seen that “in the beginning” historically,  developmentally, and phenomenologically, boundaries between the  living and inert, the subject and object, body and world, are porous.  We are inspired by the rush of the wind . . . and the tree that clings to  earth despite it . . . and the majestic immobility of the mountain that  remains long after the wind has swirled and departed. We bring these  forms into our visceral and sensorimotor organs, our meditation and  play, our consciousness and speech. We embody these powers, these  styles of being, be they defined by later analytic thought as “animal,”  “vegetable,” or “mineral.”  In Abram’s words, “Each being that we  perceive enacts a subtle integration within us, even as it alters our prior  organization. The sensing body is like an open circuit that completes  itself only in things, in others, in the surrounding earth” (2010, 254).  We inhabit the world not as an I and an it, but as a we, enriched and  expanded by performing more-than-human forms.  </page> <page sequence="15"> Embodying Otherness: Shape-shifting and the Natural World 137 Shape-Shifting Imperiled There are cultures wherein terms like “art” or “religion” have no meaning  because they are so integrated in all aspects of life that they cannot be  objectified as a special domain. So it may be in an indigenous culture,  with the kinds of “shape-shifting” we have been describing. It is simply  the condition of dwelling in the world of forest and sky, cliff and river,  amidst our many animal-cousins. However, a reason we now can and  should thematize shape-shifting is that its performance has become  restrained and imperiled. My previous discussions might suggest the  opposite—for example, the pervasiveness of shape-shifting imagery in  blockbuster film. Yet this may suggest a yearning for the magic that has  receded from our everyday life. Yes, it is there in child’s play, but then  is trained out of us as we reach adulthood and stop pretending to be  dogs. Yes, it is there in the yoga pose, or the tai chi form, but for most  these are specialized practices meant to lift us, for a particular time, out  of our norm.     What is it, operative in our culture, that has significantly diminished  the power and presence of shape-shifting?  I will briefly survey a few  factors. First, as mentioned, Western culture is significantly tilted  toward anthropocentrism and logocentrism. Theologians have taught  us that humans alone are made in the divine image, possessed of an  immortal soul, granted dominion over the natural world.  Philosophers  have pointed to our unique powers of reason, language, and moral  choice, our capacity for self-determination, and our understanding of  mortality. Accompanying this focus on what “sets us apart” is a fear  of reverting to, or being overwhelmed by, our animality. We scold a  wayward child: “Don’t wolf down your food,” or “You eat like a pig.”  In Mason’s words, “We call someone an ’animal’ when we want to  insult and debase him or her. . . . We describe horrible human beings as  ‘animals,’ ‘beasts,’ or ‘brutes’ (an old word for ‘animal’) when we want  to describe their egoism, insatiable greed, insatiable sexuality, cruelty,  senseless slaughter of nonhuman beings, and the mass slaughter of  human beings”—actually behaviors far more characteristic of humans  than other creatures (1993, 163). Rather than feeling inspired to shape- shift with other animals, we thus seek to eradicate the animal within. Another particularly modern version of nature-alienation arises with  the mechanistic world-view of early modern science. Natural entities in  general, and animals in particular, come to be viewed as machine-like.  The same physical forces, and chains of cause and effect, that determine  the motions of inanimate things are seen to underlay biological  processes (Merchant 1980; Thomas 1997; Burtt 1952). The tree is a  machine for turning sunlight into bark and leaf; the chicken, a factory  for producing eggs and breast-meat, and its behaviors understood as  genetically-encoded instinct and patterns of stimulus-response (Leder,  </page> <page sequence="16"> 138 Drew Leder 2012). After studying with indigenous shamans, and developing an  embodied sensitivity to animal-consciousness, Abram describes what  happens when he returns to this Westernized context:    I began to lose my sense of the animals’ own awareness. The gulls’  technique for breaking open the clams began to appear as a largely  automatic behavior, and I could not easily feel the attention they must  bring to each new shell. . . . I found myself now observing the heron  from outside its world, noting with interest its careful high-stepping  walk and the sudden dart of its beak into the water, but no longer  feeling its tensed yet poised alertness with my own muscles. And,  strangely, the suburban squirrels no longer responded to my chittering  calls. (2002, 25) Along with this conceptual/perceptual deadening of, and to,  nature, our unrestrained dominion has brought about very real deaths.  Animals destined for our table are removed from view and consigned  to cruel factory-farms. Patches of wilderness shrink, and so too the  numbers of wild creatures, deprived of their habitat. Animals, once so  central in human culture, increasingly become marginalized, literally  and existentially reduced to something like the zoo-spectacle (Berger  1991, 3–28). We earlier quoted Naess, who called the deep ecology  movement “largely an articulation of the implicit philosophy of 5 year  old children who have access to at least a minimum of animals, plants,  and natural places.” But can we now assume even that minimal access?  Many of us dwell in urban “mindscapes” more than natural landscapes.  We thus lose the allure and opportunity of shape-shifting.   Accompanying this theoretical, psychic, and practical shrinking of  nature and animal is an expansion of the reign of the machine. We dwell  amidst our technologies. We speed to work in our car, which enhances  our embodied motility through engine and wheels. We ride the elevator  up, obviating the need for a step-by-step climb.  We stare at the computer  screen or the smartphone, connecting to a “worldwide web.” Even our  thinking shifts in accord with computers as we “google” information  and “word-process” language, as I have in writing this paper. Our  corporeal capacity to shape-shift into new forms is thus directed toward  body-machine linkages. We become cyborgs (Haraway, 1991). Powers  that might previously have been sought through human-animal shape- shifting—speed, flight, connection, inspiration—instead are realized  through human-technology blends.  It would be simplistic to dismiss the enrichments that accompany  becoming cyborg. Mazis (2008, 58–75), for example, explores how  cochlear implants, once incorporated into the lived body, expand  the world of someone hard of hearing. Nor is there a clear boundary  between culture and nature, the technological and organic.  My dog is a  </page> <page sequence="17"> Embodying Otherness: Shape-shifting and the Natural World 139 product of culture—centuries of breeding and domestication—as much  as of nature, and together we like to drive to a favorite trail. Still, my  dog is not the same as my car. Something is lost if machines, rather than  natural beings, become my primary interlocutor. I do not experience  the same play of kinship and alterity.   In one sense, compared to the animal, the machine and I have far  less kinship. With its fiberglass body and internal combustion engine,  my car cannot participate in the organismic world of sense and desire.  It may be that I perceive it as having something like a face (a deliberate  construct of car designers), or that it is styled after an animal—there  are “Jaguars,” “Mustangs,” and “Stingrays” on the road.  I may give  it a personalized name and feel affection for it as if it were alive. As  Wilson writes, “Mechanophilia, the love of machines, is but a special  case of biophilia” (1984, 116). But ultimately the machine is not a true  companion. Etymologically, a “com-panion” is one with whom I share  bread, something I cannot do with a car, but can with my dog. She, like  me, knows a hungry stomach and the pleasures of taste. My body-car  linkage gets me where I’m going, maybe even directs me there with a  GPS synthetic voice, but ultimately I ride alone. The car and I do not  share a life-world. We can see this as a deficit of kinship. The car is too other, devoid of  animal consciousness. Yet this can also be understood as the reverse,  a deficit of alterity. In a sense, the car is not other enough. Putting aside  futuristic developments of artificial intelligence, our machines do not  manifest true independence of origin and awareness. The car, elevator,  computer, smartphone, are things that humans have made to advance  human purposes. They are anthropocentric in construction and intent.  This cannot be said of the zebra, the wolf, or even the “domesticated”  dog, who still maintains a fierce will of its own. Nor can it be said of  mountain and ocean. These natural entities are not simply our creations,  but confront us as genuine others, autonomous powers. “Diversity” is a value much lauded, at least on college campuses.  It is expanding and enriching to interact with others different in race,  nationality, religion, gender, or socioeconomic background. Yet in a  machine-dominated world we lose another form of diversity, equally  important—not simply biodiversity, as other species and ecosystems are  destroyed, but what might be called bio-experiential diversity.   Humans  have the ability to experience with and through a diversity of natural  bodies. We can dance Swan Lake; meditate like a mountain; complete  a tai chi sequence like   “Swallow Skims the Water;” sit on the beach,  becoming fluid like sand, vast as the sky, slow and rhythmic like the  sea; cavort with our dog; watch The Lion King with a thrill of vicarious  pleasure, or stretch into cobra pose in a yoga class. These provide us  with a rich bio-experiential diversity.  </page> <page sequence="18"> 140 Drew Leder  The many forms this can take—sometimes subtle and disguised,  as befits such magic—are but suggested by this paper. Shape-shifting  is found in childhood play and  development, religious iconography  and  spiritual practice, sports, fashion, film,  and the performing  arts, and many other domains not covered. We do well to keep this  theme in mind in our academic work lest we slip into an unconscious  anthropocentrism. So, too, in our cultural and personal lives, where  shape-shifting provides access to the wild energies of nature. Wind and  sky; mountain and river; dog and cat; bug and bird; we can incorporate  their embodied styles. Thus we explore our animality, and the protean  richness of being human.
