<plain_text><page sequence="1">408 BOOK LIST questions "the scholarly methodology for the reconstruction of the redactional process in the course of the history of ancient Israel". Current scepticism, he suggests, stems from "the criterion of judgement based on compatibility with modern thinking" (p. 3). We should not assume that redactors were free to alter as they chose, and so should pay less attention to them and more to the ancient traditions. He warns against treat- ing any historiography in the Hebrew Bible as a purely literary work and against putting too much emphasis on the absence of evidence (e.g. from archaeology). Wisdom from the East! [Margaret BARKER] B.SJ. ISSERLIN, The Israelites. 304 pp. (with 154 illustrations). Thames and Hudson, London, 1998. /28.00. The extensive bibliographies at the end of this superior work of haute vulgarisation demonstrate (if it were needed) that Isserlin's flowing text is based on a detailed and up-to-date acquaintance with all aspects of the history and culture of the Israelites from the time of their settlement in the land down to the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians. The book is aimed at summarizing all aspects of the life of the people in twelve chapters devoted to everything from, for instance, history to art, social structure to industries and crafts, and origins to religion. Textual evidence is treated seriously but critically, and archaeology is given its proper full place, with frequently illuminating parallels offered from further afield in the Mediterranean region. The different views on such contentious matters as the origins of the Israelites or the correlation of archaeology with the textual history of the United Monarchy are fairly and succinctly presented, and although Isserlin often indicates his preferred solutions he is scrupulous in indicating the limits of current knowledge and in pointing out where agreed data give way to scholarly hypothesis. The range of topics covered means that there will be few who will not learn from areas outside their own specialization, while at the same time the book will make for splendid introductory reading for advanced students on a number of courses relating to the Old Testament. For the well-educated general public, who are the book's main intended readership, it would be hard to find anything of comparable quality and reliability. [H.G.M. WILLIAMSON] W. JOHNSTONE, Chronicles and Exodus: An Analogy and its Application. JSOT Supplement Series 275. 331 pp. Sheffield Academic Press, Sheffield, 1998. This volume comprises twelve previously published articles (some lightly revised), one previously unpublished paper (on 1 Chron. xxi) and an extended introduction which draws attention to the elements of coherence of the whole. At the heart of the matter lies Johnstone's con- viction that the composition of Exodus can best be understood as a two-fold process, in the disentangling of which Deuteronomy's account of the same series of events acts as an objective control. He thus attempts to distinguish an underlying D version from its later P presentation in the final form of the text. He does not deny the possibility of D having used earlier material, but he considers the attempt to isolate this too spec- ulative to be worth detailed attention. In all this, he finds an analogy with the way the Chronicler rewrote the Deuteronomic History. Chapters 7-12 of the collection work out this theory by way of a detailed examination of most of the major narrative por- tions of Exodus. They demonstrate the characteristics of Johnstone's work as known from elsewhere, namely close (and often complicated) attention to the texts themselves, and only passing attempts to interact with the work of other scholars. It is thus help- ful that in the second part of the introduction he seeks to compare and contrast his work more closely with that of E. Blum, with whose views he has much in common, though they were reached entirely independently, and also to respond to some of the criticisms of their shared approach which have been raised in particular by G.I. Davies. The remaining essays in the book are less closely associated with this major theme, though they are of importance in their own right. Several deal with aspects of the Chronicler's theology, and others with separate topics raised by the book of Exodus. In the current climate of research on the Pentateuch, Johnstone's research deserves to</page><page sequence="2">BOOK LIST 409 be fully heard and evaluated, and it is to be hoped that the publication of this collection, drawing attention to the coherence of his programme, will facilitate this. [H.G.M. WILLAMSON] 0. KAISER, Gottes und der Menschen Weisheit. Gesammelte Aufsdtze. BZAW 261. viii + 321 pp. DM 168. W. de Gruyter, Berlin, 1998. The volume is a collection of fifteen previously published studies (all in German) by the professor emeritus of Marburg University, written between 1987 and 1997. The essays deal with questions regarding biblical and Greek wisdom and centre around the main insight of the finitude of human existence and the infinitude, transcendence and immanence of God. The titles of the essays are as follows: "Die Ersten und die Letzten Dinge"; "Einfache Sittlichkeit und theonome Ethik in der alttestamentlichen Weisheit"; "Der Mensch, Gottes Ebenbild und Statthalter auf Erden"; "Erwagungen zu Ps viii"; "Ps xxxix"; "Schicksal, Leid und Gott. Ein Gesprach mit dem Kohelet, Prediger Salomo"; "Determination und Freiheit beim Kohelet/Prediger Salomo und in der Frihen Stoa"; "Die Botschaft des Buches Kohelet"; "Beitrage zur Kohelet-Forschung"; "Anknupfung und Widerspruch. Die Antwort der judischen Weisheit auf die Herausforderung durch den Hellenismus"; "Was der Freund nicht tun darf. Eine Auslegung von Sir xxvii 16-21"; "Der Tod des Sokrates"; "Die Rede von Gott am Ende des 20. Jahrhundert"; "Die Bedeutung des Alten Testa- ments fur Heiden, die manchmal auch Christen sind". Detailed indexes of biblical ref- erences as well as authors, persons and items conclude this useful collection. [A.C. HAGEDORN] M. KLINGBEIL, Yahweh Fighting from Heaven. God as Warrior and as God of Heaven in the Hebrew Psalter and Ancient Near Eastern Iconography. OBO 169. xii + 361 pp. Universitatsverlag, Freiburg/Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, Gottingen, 1999. The title of this book perfectly describes its contents: Klingbeil compares the metaphors used in the Psalter with pictorial representations of ancient Near Eastern deities. He begins by surveying theories of metaphor and then charts the occurrence of various metaphors in the Psalter. The Warrior motif occurs almost exclusively in Books 1 and 2, with few in Book 3 and none in Books 4 and 5. There follows a detailed study of selected passages from Psalms xviii, xxi, xxix, xlvi, lxv, lxviii, lxxxiii and cxliv, concluding with more interesting charts of word distribution which show that there is virtually nothing in common between the texts apart from the divine name. The final part is a fasci- nating close inspection of 93 depictions of divine figures in ancient iconography, cov- ering far more than just warrior figures. Klingbeil concludes that the psalms employ a limited set of metaphors for God, of which two-thirds are anthropomorphic (p. 304). He cautiously offers an interesting conclusion: "As a compilation of hymns and songs, it is reasonable and possible to assume a rough chronological order for the Hebrew Psalter... If one correlates the decreasing frequency ... of the divine warrior metaphor, it appears that the metaphor lost its popularity..." (p. 305). He speculates about the possible dating of these psalms in view of the fact that the relevant iconography dates from the 9th to 7th centuries, and notes that this warrior motif, important in the "early" psalms, was also important in the Book of Revelation. It would have been interesting to see a similar study of anthropomorphisms, perhaps in relation to the demise of the monarchy and the survival of its ideology in Christianity. The Older Testament again? [Margaret BARKER] A. VAN DER KooIJ, The Oracle of Tyre: The Septuagint of Isaiah 23 as Version and Vision. SVT 71. x + 214 pp. Brill, Leiden, 1998. In preparing the text of Isaiah for Biblia Hebraica Quinta (BHQ), van der Kooij has produced this monograph that pro- vides a contribution both to the exegesis of the Septuagint of Isaiah and to the eval- uation of the Septuagint for text-critical purposes. Van der Kooij locates himself within the field of Septuagint interpreters, in the tradition of Z. Frankel from the nineteenth century and L. Prijs and J. Schaper from the twentieth, as emphasizing the exegetical</page></plain_text>
