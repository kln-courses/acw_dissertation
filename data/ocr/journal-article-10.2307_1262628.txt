DEMOS Flipping through The Contemporary Picturesque-the conceptualist book created by British artist Nils Norman in 2001-one finds no breathtakingly beautiful landscapes or idyllic scenes. Instead we discover a typology of "deterrent designs": barriers, surfaces, seating devices specifically made to discourage certain kinds of public behavior. For each type there are multiple examples, photographed and described through captions. For "Barriers" there are barricades that direct pedes- trians, metal gates that control crowd circulation, guardrails that block public access, traffic bollards that guide automobile routes. For "Surfaces" the book offers metal impediments placed between escalators to prevent sliding, surface studs that hamper sitting, anti- climb paint, antivandal materials, areas like steps or sidewalks that are periodically watered down to thwart loitering. For "Seats" there are inhospitable bus-stop perching ledges, vandal-proof metal and stone benches, uncomfortable garden-style folding chairs. Terse cap- tions explain that the seating designs ideally limit comfort in order to dissuade long periods of relaxation and to prevent sleeping: "Minimal design bus stop: low-maintenance, vandal proof with token perching ledge for short term leaning. An ingenious design deterrent offering little shelter from the elements at minimum cost." Introducing this archive of disciplinary designs-worthy of Michel Foucault or the Marquis de Sade-Norman notes that "Contemporary street furniture and tech- nologies of surveillance are the physical infrastructure, the outward signs of the training, regulation and correction of behaviour to be found on a new island in the 'carceral Archipelago': the modern city."1 Reading through this study, a slim volume under forty pages, we learn that public space has undergone massive transformations in recent years. It has become a disciplinary zone of surveillance ruled by increasingly efficient technologies of bodily regulation, one con- nected to the simultaneous defunding of public infrastructure and increased privatization. "This obsession with physical security systems, and, collaterally, with the architectural policing of social boundaries, has become a zeitgeist of urban restructuring, a master narrative in the emerging built environment of the 1990s," writes Mike Davis in City of Quartz, his landmark study of the new carceral city: "Fortress L.A."2 Roughly ten years later Norman proves Davis correct. More, he shows i3. ? 2003 Grey Room, Inc. and Massachusetts Institute of Technology 33 Grey Room 13. Fall 2003, pp</page><page sequence="3">this restructuring to be globalized, "the modern city" of New York, London, Hamburg, Tel Aviv being the object of his analysis in The Contemporary Picturesque. While all of this surely resonates more than ever with today's post-9/11 paranoid environment, the hypostasis of "national security," and efforts to "secure the homeland," Norman's work in fact precedes them, showing that the militarized fortification of cities has been long in the making.3 The Contemporary Picturesque historicizes current developments in city design, locating their origins in nineteenth-century Paris and the urban restructuring that was Haussmannization. During that period of urbanization and population growth, the city of Paris grew from a medieval town of small dark streets and tightly packed communities into a cosmopolitan society organized by rationalized networks of grand boulevards, which became "the panoptic spatial expression of control in city design," as Norman notes in an introductory essay. He writes further: To stroll in the new cities of the 19th century was to encounter a society imposing and establishing new norms of behaviour and measures of delinquency. The process was in part a deliberate training and perhaps more importantly an internalization of new rules and expectations-in order that capital's accelerating flow of workers and goods could continue to develop, unhindered by excessive outbreaks of emancipation or solidarity around common causes. Photographs of contemporary urban space detail how this "training" and "internalization of new rules and expectations" have advanced to the point of an architectural design specialization more than a century later. Panoptic systems have been tweaked, street furniture perfected, surveillance technologies ever improved. It appears that Foucault's earlier speculations about an eventual "ideal point" of "infinite disci- pline" in which "the individual is carefully fabricated" is well on its way to being implemented.4 Against a growing number of photographers who beautify the current globalized conditions of public space-through dramatic com- positions, saturated colors, digital processing, high-quality prints (for instance, Andreas Gursky)-Norman's images are decidedly anti- aesthetic. Mostly black-and-white documentary shots, they simply and directly focus in on their subjects without flourish or composi- tional artistry. The photograph of "surface studs," for instance, pro- vides a close-up view of a marble ledge punctuated with steel points. Uniformly in focus, shot at an oblique angle, the image merely serves to provide visual information efficiently. Pedantically, a curt caption is added: "Upmarket metal studs on marble prevent people from sitting 34 Grey Room 13</page><page sequence="4">on private property and add a perverse yet strangely apt S&amp;M flavour to the City's streets." Or, another photograph shows a man watering down public steps to prevent loitering in front of a store. A wider frame is employed to show the full expanse of the surface area. Nondescript and banal, it obeys a law of maximum legibility. If such photographs constitute our "contemporary picturesque," then this suggests a tragicomic gesture that exploits the difference between the ideal and the actual by reversing the terms, best described as ironic. On the one hand, Norman's use of the term picturesque invokes a state of ideal beauty in order to sarcastically cast into relief the depressing reality that has turned urban space into a carceral zone in which to discipline and punish. On the other, it parodies the contemporary art that transforms such scenes of domination into visual delectation, such as the ever-increasing monumentalized photographs that aes- theticize architectures of consumerism or spaces of social inequality, making them into sublime typologies of masochistic desire rather than fostering critical viewpoints.5 In contrast, Norman resuscitates older conceptual lineages in order to explore how public space has been fractured by conflicting inter- ests and to invoke strategies to rupture the seeming ineluctability of these conditions. Like the work of Allan Sekula or Martha Rosler, his representational format of photography and text is heterogeneous, breaking down the photographic referent-pubic space-into its dis- cursive conditions, political determinations, and historical genealo- gies. Norman's artistic activism also invokes the oppositional practices of Hans Haacke and Krzysztof Wodiczko, where the supposed neutral- ity of space gives way to its political and economic field. If Norman's typological model recalls conceptual photography, it resembles less that of the Bechers-careful and aestheticizing views of industrial architectures-and more the deadpan and amateur delivery of Ed Ruscha. The photographs in the book are not only taken by Norman but derive partly from public image archives. Similarly, a wide array of urban studies and historical accounts of public space is referenced in the text. Norman's work consequently diversifies authorial agency, which prevents the fetishization of an individual photographic style or single artist's voice. The focus, instead, is on the critical examina- tion of disciplinary mechanisms at work in public space. However, while the need for such a critical project seems more urgent now than ever, one detects an unmistakable humor in The Contemporary Picturesque, a tongue-in-cheek intonation that brings levity to its voice, which distances it from those earlier artistic models. Often self-directed, Norman's irony is not easy to pin down: Is it the perfunctory seriousness with which his analysis is undertaken, with all the appropriate nods to conceptual art and urban studies, paralleled 35</page><page sequence="5">by the incredible and humorous nature of its objects of study? Is it the sarcastic suggestion that today's counterparts to Poussin and Claude- the original painters of the picturesque-are the petty designers of manipulative street furniture? Or could it be the absurdist gesture of proposing a new front for activist energies, one that would protest the emergence of inhospitable bus seats and manipulative guardrails? (Yet the book seems to compel just that when it shows the sadistically oppressive design of public space.) If it becomes clear that it is difficult to consider The Contemporary Picturesque as a new model of activist art, then what ends does its irony serve? It was Robert Smithson's study of Olmsted's "picturesque" Central Park, appearing in Artforum in 1973, that acted as one point of depar- ture for Norman's project. Smithson's essay, "Frederick Law Olmsted and the Dialectical Landscape," employs the term picturesque as a way to de-idealize the landscape, even if this sounds counterintuitive. But rather than drawing on the familiar connotations of the term, which suggest some immutable category or idealized static identity, Smithson found in it a way to stress the landscape's location within an inter- twined network of abstract representations, shifting temporal condi- tions, and multiple social uses. To backtrack, Smithson wished to develop within his own artistic practice a revisionary understanding of the landscape in order to escape from "the spiritualism of Thoreauian transcendentalism," and, more immediate to his context in the early- 1970s, from its offspring, the lingering "'modernist formalism' rooted in Kant, Hegel and Fichte." Those authors saw nature as "a thing-in- itself" rather than "a process of ongoing relationships existing in a physical region ... a 'thing-for-us."'6 This tendency began much ear- lier, noted Smithson, with Edmund Burke's Inquiry in the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful of 1757, which posited a "dialectic" between the "beautiful" and the "sublime,"-the former signifying qualities such as smoothness, gentle curves, and natural delicacy; the latter terror, solitude, and vastness. Both were rooted in the real world rather than in a Hegelian ideal realm. Moving into the later-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, Uvedale Price and William Gilpin pushed Burke's theory further, synthesizing his terms in a new descriptor: the "picturesque." Smithson argued that the het- erogeneity suggested in this word, and evident in its history, would provide a way to defeat static understandings of the landscape. The picturesque would emphasize processes of chance and change in the material order of nature. If a "dialectical landscape," then its "dialectic" was meant to refer to an irrevocable state of conflict and internal 36</page><page sequence="6">Robert Smithson. Central Park, 1972. difference rather than a sublated unity. And because it necessitates active interpretation and ongoing conceptual negotiation, the pic- turesque would reclaim the landscape as a "thing-for-us" rather than reflecting some idealist self-enclosed entity given over to us. New York City's Central Park was a case in point. "Olmsted's parks," Smithson noted, "exist before they are finished, which means in fact they are never finished; they remain carriers of the unexpected and of contradiction on all levels of human activity, be it social, political, or natural"(160). Smithson's photographs stress this heterogeneity, elicit- ing the landscape's dialectic. They capture Central Park in extraordinary moments of physical transition, existing through and between differ- ent historical periods and disparate spaces. Focusing on one area behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art-perfectly exemplifying the landscape in formation-one photograph from his essay shows a wall marked up with graffiti, situated between nature and a construction site, where "nature" and "construction" are thrown into productive confusion. Revealed as a zone of social, political, and natural conflict, the scene emphasizes a landscape composed of images within images. Photography's own doubleness as a reproductive technology opens up the landscape's multiplicity. For Craig Owens, this reveals the mise en abyme of Smithson's photography, where "reality itself appears to be already constituted by an image."7 Consequently, photography's rep- resentational structure becomes "allegorical," occurring "whenever one text is doubled by another," as Owens defined it.8 The publication of Smithson's essay in Artforum also rendered his landscape allegorical, pushing it even more into a labyrinth of "sites" and "nonsites," the artist's terms for the inextricable relation between geography and its representations. The essay would submit the land- scape to further doublings and recodings, now in the act of its dis- semination. Smithson frequently played off the inevitable redefinition of the site that resulted when this occurred. And he often ironized this 37</page><page sequence="7">structure of discursive mimesis (when the object or site gives itself over to the conventions of its distribution form), as when he presented and narrated a slide show of a run-down hotel in Palenque, Mexico, as if it were an important pre-Columbian archeological site; or when he conspicuously termed dilapidated industrial machinery and dis- carded piping in Passaic, New Jersey, "monuments," as if they were of art-historical importance. The irony of such gestures is clear, though Smithson seemed to draw on its less derisive sense, merely producing a rhetorical incongruity between apparent and intended meanings.9 A variant of the allegorical, irony opens a breach within its own language, inviting an often comic discrepancy between its different senses, as if placing the signifier in quotation marks and pushing its contextual play.10 In Smithson's case the emphasis on the doubleness of language revealed how different forms of discourse could play a role in the reframing of unexpected objects-like the run-down Hotel Palenque or the "The Great Pipe Monument" in Passaic-when they are submitted to its terms. And it would subsequently reflect critically on its own repre- sentational conventions-like the art history lecture or the magazine article-as well as give a new perspective to their represented objects. Smithson's "dialectic of place" prepared the ground for Norman's book project in that it exposed "reality" as being far from natural or unified (as conservative understandings of the picturesque would have it) but instead traversed by ideological layers and contradictory repre- sentations. In fact, while teaching in New York recently, Norman revis- ited the sites of Smithson's study with a group of students. Also, it provided an artistic strategy that would erode the reification of public space by revealing its picturesque heterogeneity through a complex represen- tational system. Consequently urban space is exposed as a conflicted sociopolitical field-one goal of Norman's project. Norman's work develops this de-idealizing view and specifies how the "picturesque" operates today: "as an important tool of gentrification."11 In relation to Smithson, Norman's The Contemporary Picturesque explains that Central Park is now more picturesque than Olmsted could ever have hoped for. Tomkins Square park has been redesigned so that it is more panoptic in form; it has a strict, police-patrolled curfew and its walkways have been widened to two police car widths. Herald Square has two triangular-shaped parks, both in a distinctly Haussmannesque style with extra wide walk- ways, curfews, private guards and a token sprinkling of low- maintenance shrubbery. Additionally, we can trace back to Smithson the ironic structure that is evident in Norman's work and informs its double-edged tone. This doubleness unfolds from the duplicitous model that is The 38</page><page sequence="8">Contemporary Picturesque: on the one hand, the book references cer- tain conceptual models-such as the photo-typologies of Ruscha, or the visual-textual complex of Smithson; but on the other hand, it mimics the very tourist guidebooks and commercial urban-planning brochures that helped produce the picturesque in the first place.12 This latter mimicry is clear in the modish design of the book, the sometimes glossy illustrations and cliched captions, as well as in its language, which seems to alternate between critique and advertisement ("Minimal design ... at minimum cost"). Yet how do such models interact when melded so closely together? If conceptual paradigms are meant to sub- vert commercial design, what happens when this strategy backfires- or is that the point? What is gained when the book speaks out of both sides of its mouth? And more broadly, what is the relevance and value of such ironic gestures for contemporary artistic practice? While the doubleness at work in Norman's project surely satirizes the "contemporary picturesque"-the disciplinary public space and the urban-planning brochures that reproduce it-a further effect is that it distances itself from the very forms of criticality it invokes. This appears to be a result of the inevitable doubt with which one approaches any supposedly subversive model of artistic activity today in the wake of the seeming failures of the past-a skepticism already apparent with Smithson thirty years ago. And it seems to acknowledge the con- sistent inability of advanced art to halt, or even slow, the growth of globalized corporate hegemony, let alone the voracious real estate industry. For when it tries, we witness the seemingly inevitable con- version of critique into affirmation, identified by Benjamin Buchloh as the "major paradox of all conceptual practices," now nearly forty years old: "that the critical annihilation of cultural conventions itself immediately acquires the conditions of the spectacle, that the ... demolition of authorship produces instant brand names and identifiable products, and that the campaign to critique conventions of visuality ... inevitably ends by following the preestablished mechanisms of adver- tising and marketing campaigns."13 How can such critical practices be resuscitated today without a sense of skepticism and doubt? Or, consider Fredric Jameson's view of the modern transformation of the sublime, which forms part of the picturesque. For Jameson, the sublime was once expressed in Modernism's search for an Absolute that stood outside of capitalism's popular culture of consumerism. This autonomous zone of negativity, where avant-garde practice was once purportedly located, has gradually disappeared in what Jameson refers to as the "postmodern" era. Instead, the "Beautiful"-the other half of the Cruel Dialectic: On the Work of Nis Norman 39 Demos</page><page sequence="9">picturesque-has become ascendant, j , ii but is now fused with commercialism: "the return of the Beautiful must be i seen as just such a systematic dominant: , , a colonization of reality generally by spatial and visual forms which is at i4iil one and the same time a commodifica- tion of that same intensively colonized reality on a world-wide scale."14 If the sublime once existed in the modern period, when it coincided with modernism, then it offered a space bulwarked against commod- ification; that is, until the distinction between the two collapsed under the pressure of late capitalism. Accordingly, we now face a world where, according to Jameson, everything visible is acculturated and everything acculturated, commodified. One consequence is that we meet the end of the "aesthetic" as such, where all "traditional distinctiveness or 'specificity' of the aesthetic (and even of culture as such) is necessarily blurred or lost altogether."15 A second result is that today, when the image is so thoroughly consolidated into the commodity form, contemporary "pseudo-aestheticism" is revealed to be an ideological maneuver and can no longer function as a creative resource. All beauty, Jameson con- cludes, is now meretricious. Far from existing as an unaware effect of these developments, Norman's practice elaborates on them and stealthily operates within their terms. From his book we gain a picture of how the "picturesque"- Jameson's Beautiful in humorous reversal-is often composed out of the ruins of past avant-garde forms, specifically in terms of the com- plicity of its aesthetic with commercial design. This occurs in two ways: in the design of public space and in the design of the represen- tation of that space. In terms of the design of public space, what is surprising in Norman's photographs is that the deterrent designs appearing within them paradoxically resemble "minimal designs," to use Norman's term-whether as a modular surface of pyramidal mold- ings built into the ground to make sitting uncomfortable that recalls so many Andre floor sculptures or as the repetitive structure of an industrial steel gate that directs traffic that brings to mind Judd's work. Once offering an aesthetic of negation against the encroachment of the commodity form, minimalism's serial structures and monochromatic surfaces now find themselves employed as vehicles to facilitate con- sumerism. Minimalism thus becomes a tool of urban discipline, its negativity reverses into instrumentalization, its anti-anthropomorphism becomes urban design's sadism. If minimalist structures once provided complex spaces of perceptual critique or offered ideal possibilities for phenomenological self-consciousness, they are now directed against the public body, transmogrifying into a logic of "defensible space" and Nils Norman.

'Steps' Court Building, New York, 1966. psychosomatic manipulation.16 And if postminimalism later attempted to make one aware of the deep socio- political fissures in public space and in the very constitution of the "public" by materializing spatial divisions through the use of large-scale sculptural interventions (most famously in Richard Serra's Tilted Arc17), today's deterrent designs increasingly relegate the "public" to an ever narrowed bracket of consumers. Moreover, they work to purify the public by elimi- ,~ . ...| nating all undesirables: to keep the vagrant body away from certain areas, off surfaces, regulated when seated, controlled when walking, all in the name of repro- ducing an ideal consumerized body. Once considered emancipatory, minimalism is now channeled under the sign of the spectacle, coloniz- ing reality on a global scale even while serving as the perverse decoration of public space. Norman's exposure of this "contemporary picturesque" is not unique. A precedent exists in Dan Graham's work of the 1960s, specif- ically his dry photographs of "minimalist" urban spaces and those in his magazine project, Homes for America (1966), which located mod- ular structures in the repetitive architecture of mass-produced housing. As a result, minimalism's claims to autonomy and criticality were long ago jeopardized. Additionally, by enveloping his own "art object" within its commercial distribution system-publishing Homes for America in the pages of a mass-produced art magazine-Graham, like Smithson, showed artistic objects to be inevitably recoded by com- mercial institutions. Norman's work is doubly indebted: first, it simi- larly examines the commercial instrumentalization of minimalism even while it updates the analysis by revealing the perversity of min- imalism's reappearance in the guise of disciplinary design (here con- necting with Graham's own investigations into surveillance and the visuality of corporate architecture); and second, its representational model, like Graham's, internalizes the very format of its target of critique: in Norman's case, commercial design booklets-a move we'll consider shortly. Nor is Norman's the only contemporary artistic practice that has examined this "perverse" legacy of minimalism. Similar is certain work of Tom Burr, particularly the series of photographs entitled Palm Beach Views of 1999, which show images of landscape hedges that resemble minimalist objects, but put to disciplinary purpose. In its use of photography and text, the series also invokes the work of Smithson and Graham, and it deploys an ironic documentary mode as well. Burr photographed what he calls "anti-public" landscape designs, hedges cut into minimalist geometries, strategically grown to segregate and protect 41</page><page sequence="11">the private property of wealthy gated communities. The photo- graphic viewpoints are deadpan, revealing intransigent faCades that ridiculously obscure the archi- tecture they guard. In the short text that accompanies the photos, Burr unravels an allegory of imag- ined transgression within the hedges, connecting their spaces to his sculptural projects (such as Deep Purple). This reclaims in fiction not only the liminal space of the hedges but also the erotic allure of mini- malism, evoked through his subjective recodings.18 Such artistic prac- tice doubles back on the work of preceding generations, wrestling artistic models away from their commercial appropriations, rendering minimalism's perversion by design perverse in turn. But if Burr's project, like Norman's, functions critically, it also reads at times as absurdist but with a point. Simultaneously, it seems, this art attacks not only its targeted object (urban design or suburban landscaping) for its abuses of the avant-garde; it also reflexively revisits its own form, self-consciously complicating its own mode of transmission. Such reflexive twists appear in other works of Norman, such as a related project of 2001 that documents a public square in Bristol, entitled Edible Playscape Bristol. For that Norman created a poster that shows vari- ous photographic views of St. James Barton Roundabout, a dilapidated urban area marked for gentrification. The views reveal the existent deter- rent designs, barren walkways, and the depressing landscaping of the roundabout; others show the predatory billboards of the real estate industry advertising the first stages of redevelopment-the conversion of postindustrial spaces into luxury lofts. Texts, interspersed through- out the poster, further clue us in on this logic: "The physical deterio- ration and economic devalorisation of inner-city neighbourhoods is a strictly logical, rational outcome of the operation of the land and housing markets," reads one caption, quoting Neil Smith.19 Others identify a com- mon strategy of gentrification once the process of planned devalorization is complete: the "theme-ing" of public space, whereby romantic and nostalgic associations (e.g., from Bristol's maritime past) are cast over target areas to market them as alluring for the "pioneers" of redevelop- ment. In such cases "History becomes a clich6," as the poster informs us. As a result of this presentation, the roundabout is revealed as a structural object of disciplinary urban planning, gentrification, and profiteering.

In many ways this photomontage is less avant-gardist than advertisement or infomercial, less fissured materiality than smoothly assembled and printed image. It appears as a self-conscious take-off of recent innovations in commercial design (calling to mind, for instance, models such as Bruce Mau Design, responsible for the work on Zone Books and Rem Koolhaas's S,M,L,XL). Like The Contemporary Picturesque, the Bristol poster paradoxically combines critical and consumerist forms of representation-but to what end? If "The central proposition [of design] involves erasing the boundaries between archi- tecture and information, the real and the virtual," as Mau claims,20 then this also divulges the strategy behind the theme-ing of public spaces such as Bristol's square: turning architecture into information allows the easy manipulation of the real via the virtual. Hal Foster identifies the commercial value of such an erasure of boundaries: "Today it has reached the point where not only commodity and sign appear as one, but often so do commodity and space: in actual and virtual malls the two are melded through design."21 Norman's poster captures this very absorption of public space by urban design at the level of graphic spectacle. By mimicking the pack- aging of public space in urban planners' visual materials, real estate advertisements, and designer handouts (some of the models Norman claims for himself), the poster mimics the ways in which design- as the commercial progeny of avant-garde photomontage-has trans- formed public space into a virtual realm of manipulation. It shows that the disciplinary transformation of real space is paralleled by the com- modification of its representational space. Increasingly collapsed 43</page><page sequence="13">together, each is equally designed for and by private interests. While the poster morphs the ruins of avant-garde photomontage into the digitized currency of graphic design, it also dramatizes the contrast between the decaying urban areas it represents and the poster's glossy surface. The move is not only mimetic but critical. While the poster reveals once again the termination of modernist negation in the accommodation of capitalism (though avant-garde photomontage was long ago appropriated as advertisement or instrumentalized as propa- ganda), Norman only begins with this acknowledgment and then attempts to carve out critical space in its aftermath. In the process the poster uses design procedures to expose the economic cycle of decay and renewal by focusing on run-down public areas at the moment when the process of gentrification begins-when dilapidated space is metamorphosed into the high-finished surface that his poster internalizes. If texts are interspersed within the montage, they attempt to open up the image, rupturing its seduction, interrupting its visual field with critical analysis and historical content. Here the poster puts design strategies to subversive ends: to spread unconventional information, to educate the public about the plans and tactics of the real estate industry, to reveal the machinations in the urban planning of Bristol.22 Conversely, the poster's design also indicates the degree to which any contestatory content is liable to be spectacularized itself. In fact, part of the point-and the very function of its irony-seems to be to reflect on the compromised status of criticality today. This explains, per- haps, why its texts, even while freighted with radical content, appear to degenerate into slogans themselves, especially within their reified surface. Decontextualized, they float in space, taking on an ambiguous relation to the photographs that appear next to or under them. Absorbed into a sound-bite model of communication, they become vulnerable to the consumerist habits that more and more infect viewing conditions today. "History becomes a cliche," indeed. The inevitable limitations of artistic models that would be politically subversive thus become reflexively identified in Norman's work, which distances itself from its own critical agenda even while advancing it. A critique of gentrification is offered and criticality's collapse into spectacle is exposed. Is this yet another dialectical landscape-of geographical sites, conflictual representations, contradictory conventions, and oppositional forces- that is opened up to view even while it all paradoxically coalesces into a single overdetermined articulation? Its ironic distance-from itself, from the models it employs-signals that there is more here than what meets the eye. Another way to look at it, however, is to see its irony as not only producing cynical conclusions but creating productive pos- sibilities as well, for advancing critique without the self-assuredness and triumphalism of previous artistic models. 44</page><page sequence="14">Nils Norman. Edible Playscape, Bristol, 2001. Back view. Courtesy: Nils Norman. The counterpart to Norman's critical, photographic-based work is his series of utopian "Proposals." Made out of computer-generated dia- grams or small-scale three-dimensional models, they offer ideal ways to redesign parks, museums, and other existing public spaces, some of which are documented in his photographic work. They typically suggest the development of emancipatory architectures, the utilization of ecologies based on renewable energies and sustainable resources, the promotion of radical forms of democratic organization, and so on. Exemplary is the proposal printed on the other side of the Bristol poster, where its utopian proposal becomes the reverse of its docu- mented reality-or reality, utopia's dark underside. The redesigned Bristol square is tentatively renamed The Edible Forest Garden Park and Monument to Civil Disobedience Adventure Playground, St. James Barton Roundabout, Bristol. The image entices us with its proposi- tions for an inclusive and egalitarian public area with environmen- tally sensitive gardens and politically correct monuments. Rendered as a mostly green island, it is shown in perspective, set off against a light blue background, with texts surrounding and explaining the dia- grams or placed in bubbles that mimic the circular shape of the garden. Gone is the sharp rectilinearity that organized the other side of the poster, and documentary photomontage has been exchanged for a cleaned-up, simplified style of digital illustration. The imagined park is filled with several community gardens, where fruit trees and veg- etables are grown for public consumption. There is space for a farmer's market and a wildlife sanctuary. Captions describe it further: "The park is made into a 'Commons,' owned and maintained by the people of Bristol preventing development by corporate and private interests." 45</page><page sequence="15">Countering gentrification, deterrent designs, and privatization, the Playground redirects the roundabout so that it privileges "equal opportu- nities, social justice, inclusion of disadvantaged people and a strong commitment to sustainable development." Norman's proposals suggest, in a way, a cri- | tique of critique, implying that the subversion L of existing discourses and practices is today insufficient. They answer the spectaculariza- tion of negation (revealed in his critical photography) with the need for something constructive. This is an important development because it signals the fact that Norman's project moves beyond artistic models of the 1980s and 1990s that focused solely on critical negation but without proposing alternatives.23 But if the proposals turn away from these critical models, they resonate with other avant-garde precedents, calling up various utopian practices from Soviet constructivism to the Situationists. For example, some evoke constructivist models for kiosks and pavilions (e.g., his Proposal 14 of 1999, called "a small children's rights and anti-patriarchy non-violent direct action kiosk"); others recall Soviet agitprop vehicles such as trains and ships (redeployed in his Geocruiser bus of 2001). The Bristol Playground parallels projects such as Konstantin Melnikov's Plan for the Green City of 1929. Schematized in a circular diagram using text and pictograms, the plan envisions an island of ideal life, offering a collectivist retreat for the regeneration of the urban proletariat, industrialized and exhausted. The City would offer gardens and a forest for sunlight and fresh air. Solar pavilions would be built to concentrate the sun's rays on pallid faces. When out- side, visitors would be able to reunite with an idealized nature where wild animals roamed freely. A "Laboratory of Sleep," utilizing every available technology, would ensure workers' rest, and the City's energy would be drawn from the wind.24 In other respects, Norman's Playground-particularly its scaffolding structures, sky walks, and aerial bridges-brings to mind the work of Constant. Norman's fre- quent use of such elements, designed for civil-disobedience training or to ensure means of circulation and escape from police (though it is unclear-at least at this point-why one would need to escape from utopia), suggest forms of deterritorialization and autonomy also found in the playscapes of Constant, particularly his models and diagrams for New Babylon. Constant's futuristic architectures would encourage emancipatory ways of inhabiting space, ludic behavior through endless derives, once labor was outmoded by advancing technology.25 But if Norman's proposals are designated as "utopian" gestures-he uses the term himself to describe them-then, unlike these avant-garde Konstantin Melnikov.

Orange Construction, 1958. z? =!'-~__ precedents, they emphasize the ia...... ,-...... impossibility that is written into the tadigns~ is -- nBvery term utopia as a "non-place."26 Norman's utopian proposals announce their impossibility, first of all, in the "sca j "?.4~ Ttypical multiplicity of their refer- ences: if they point to avant-garde genealogies, they also call up pop-cultural representations, such as the assembly directions for Ikea products or the "imagineered" designs of Disney parks.27 But this conflation of avant-garde models and pop-cul- tural designs is not simply formal. The Bristol Playground is as much an architecture of "reassurance" as any Disney formula.28 Both reduce the complexity of sociopolitical-environmental crises to cartoonlike solutions-just how, for example, will the Bristol proposal achieve "social justice"? The phrase reads as empty (perhaps that's why escape is necessary). In concentrating these contradictory meanings into a single surface, Norman suggests various connections among them, creating another "dialectical landscape." But if we witness the conjunction of utopian programs with present-day spectacle, then this is less comparative than genealogical. There are of course numerous reasons, which have been well mapped out, to consider why such utopian dreamworlds have ended in catastrophe.29 The great Soviet experiment eventually spiraled downward into oppressive Stalinist domination, while the revolutionary hopes of the 1960s were realized as industrialized leisure and marketed lifestyles or as nonspaces of mass public banality.30 Martha Rosler's recent Airport Series perfectly captures one such trajectory of this degeneration into dystopia by dis- covering the perverted legacy of Constant's New Babylon and other avant-garde strategies in current conditions: The utopian dream of architecture, removed from the spaces of daily life, was fastened onto nowheresville airportland, a con- trolled city space that is a cousin to the false fronts of new (sub)urbanism, another incarnation of gated, and policed, sites of habitation. The minimalism of such spaces, which appear to answer to the disjunct needs of modern transit and commerce, mutely promise the giant empty room that Adorno and others used as the presiding metaphor of the modern surveillance society-the society of total administration.31 However, if Norman's proposals recognize the difficulty in articu- lating their utopian promise outside of their commercial appropriation, the artist still tries: he explains that "resuscitating previous experimental corpses, largely perceived as failures or embarrassingly dated modes of thinking, is a deliberate route chosen for reaccessing dimensions of 47</page><page sequence="17">memory and history discarded by the market."32 Such a path would seem to avoid the overpowering sense of nostal- gia and melancholy that are the com- mon side effects of allegory by refusing to collapse the loss of the dream into the historical failures of its realization. Similarly, Susan Buck-Morss writes, "we ... would do well to bring the ruins up close and work our way through the rubble in order to rescue the utopian hopes that moder- nity engendered, because we cannot afford to let them disappear."33 Yet if Norman's utopian proposals reveal their impossibility by invoking the very systems of co-optation that have rendered them unlikely, they aren't impossible due to any technological reasons: Permaculture is available, alternative fuel is feasible, solar energy is operational, democratic forms of organizing society are not unknown. This is a critical point: Norman's projects could be built but aren't. They are within grasp but go unrealized. This leads to two conclu- sions. First, Norman's use of "utopia" exposes the degree to which the utopian itself has been colonized, such that even those desires to change reality in ways that are possible are consigned to a zone of fiction. Tagging something as utopian appears as an easy way to dismiss unconventional ideas. In the process, imagination is itself shut down, either as a result of feared accusations of "utopianism" or through the inability to imagine change. Such has long been the case. Adorno long ago suggested that the derogatory use of the utopian functioned to resolve contradictions between the possibilities of change and their extreme difficulties, or their impossibility in certain ways, so that one identifies with the impossibility in order to surrender imaginative and unorthodox thinking. The result, in effect, is to masochistically iden- tify with the aggressor: "saying this should not be, whereby they feel that it is precisely this that should be."34 Second, Norman's work points to other factors besides technological reasons that make the proposals unlikely, if not impossible: the powerful structures of private interests that enforce a disciplinary regime in public areas; the domination of the profit mechanism over all else; the systemic repro- duction-of regular cycles of dilapidation and gentrification; govern- mental bodies vulnerable to the influence of corporate power; the training of the "public" as a homogeneous mass of consumers; and so on. Norman's use of the utopian, in other words, critically reflects back on reality. It is consequently not surprising to learn that the proposals aren't meant to be realized, contrary to those commentaries that have critiqued his work for existing only at the level of proposal.35 Norman explains: Martha Rosier. Untitled (JFK), 1999. Courtesy: Martha Rosier. 48</page><page sequence="18">My main use of utopia as a tool is to use it to show what isn't there, to use it in a critical way. I have no intention for these utopias to be realized. They are meant to show what cannot be realized. I use them to try to develop a consciousness for myself as well as also for whoever might come into a discourse with me about them. It is about why these things aren't possible and then it opens up discussions on capitalism, urbanity and so on.36 Ever skeptical about the potentially disastrous realization of "utopia," Norman limits his suggestions to mere proposals in order to avoid the dangers of moralism, the authoritarianism of imposed ethical posi- tions, if not the certain co-optation of such ideas as still more con- sumerized eco-aesthetic lifestyles, where the utopian is channeled to fictionally solve sociopolitical problems (but in reality allows them to perpetuate).37 Such skepticism corresponds to the representational distance that separates the literalism of Norman's proposals from their ironized meaning. For it is the structure of an allegorical doubling, a referential duplicity, that organizes his proposals. This explains the absence of any literal optimism and reveals the overdetermined basis of the utopian proposals, just as it structures his critical analyses of pub- lic space. In this sense, Norman's use of utopia-like that of irony- performs what Louis Marin calls an "absolute transgression" that is uniquely available within "utopic practice."38 As a negative shadow of reality, utopic practice criticizes society and its laws. But this trans- gression doubles back on itself too, implying the reversal of its own representations. For Marin, the end of this cycle comes back to the real world: "Its termination will mark the closure of the text, the end of the discourse, and the beginning of revolutionary practice. Its abandonment is signaled by the return to real society and to the general ideology it produces."39 It appears that this is perhaps one of the few remaining possibilities for critical practice today. What Adorno said long ago appears to be still valid: At the center of contemporary antinomies is that art must be and wants to be utopia, and the more utopia is blocked by the real functional order, the more this is true; yet at the same time art may not be utopian in order not to betray it by providing sem- blance and consolation.40 Norman answers with his own "cruel dialectic" between criticality and construction in which we realize that the more we experience oppression the more we long for utopian alternatives.41 It is thus not surprising that we are today witnessing a return to the utopian-yet a return not always as convincing as Norman's due to a frequent absence of self-critique or irony. For without it, we can see that what goes 49</page><page sequence="19">unacknowledged is the fact that such utopian alternatives often appear satisfied only through commodified solutions, so that the trappings of utopia turn out to be just as imprisoning as the oppressive conditions that gave rise to them. Yet the refusal of the utopian may be just as problematic as its acceptance, it results in an inadvertent complicity with the given sociopolitical and economic order of things, which is effectively identical to the potential naive escapism of the utopian- thus the cruelty of Norman's dialectic. But can we propose any political alternatives without eliciting the utopian? Even those practices reduced to the purest negativity or based within the most rigorous denial of escapism leave a tacit "it should be otherwise," as Adorno long ago recognized.42 Indeed, Norman's work shows that criticality might cloak its own idealism, one easily com- modified as well. But unlike those constructions of utopia that function as the (false) ideological resolution of social and political contradic- tions (as in Hollywood film),43 Norman's work operates as the very agent in the comprehension of sociopolitical and economic contra- dictions, allowing us to understand "why these things aren't possible" so that perhaps one day "it may be otherwise. " The doubleness in his project-within and between critical exposition and utopian pro- posals-allows a number of positions to be pursued at once without a flat-footed literalism or realism's naivete. As a result, a space is opened in which utopia and reality might suggestively interact. 50</page><page sequence="20">Notes 1.

My reading consequently places Norman's work in the terrain of conceptual art rather than architecture or urban planning. A contrary argument is formulated by Gregory Sholette, whose call to action seems to miss the representational critique of Norman's work: "what can not be stressed enough is the need to move beyond ideal- ized exhibition settings and into long range political commitments where conceptual theorizing, such as Norman's can be field tested through site specific collaborative work involving artist and activists."

In fact, for Marin, irony and utopia share a similar structure of self-negation: "Irony can be seen as the completely gratuitous loss of meaning; it annihilates mean- ing, every meaning, for its opposite. Utopic dialogue is the serious play by which dis- course's signification is put into circulation to be immediately removed from it: its stable meaning is erased." Marin, 80. 39. Marin, 81-82.
