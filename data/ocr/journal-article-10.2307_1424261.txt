Cambridge, Mass: Har- vard University Press, 1964. $6.75 Accelerated urbanization focuses ever greater at- tention upon man as he relates to his man-made (designed) environment. The designers responsible for this environment find themselves in an increas- ingly awkward position as a battery of scientific and quasi-scientific disciplines systematically reveal not only the gravity of emerging man-environment prob- lems but the unprecedented complexity of them as well. As the designer struggles to get control over his fugacious domain, he finds that problems on all levels are indeed more complex than he had previ- ously assumed. This phenomenon, together with the final breakdown of absolute ideas in this century, bares the possibility that we may have tacitly mis- understood the nature of the problem confronting us. In concluding his introduction, Alexander puts the issue squarely: ". . . our innocence is lost and once again, of course, the innocence once lost, cannot be regained. The loss demands attention, not denial." A minute examination of the subject-matter under- lying writings on architecture both past and present is revealing; they deal primarily with: post facto phenomena, ie products of design, the consequences of bad design orientations and the attributes of good design orientations. To identify the attributes of that which is "good" is one thing; to produce a conceptual model of procedures which yields such attributes is quite another: for example, to state that a building ought to be "functional," obviously helps us no more than to say that it ought to be beautiful. Alexander addresses himself directly and systematically to the problems of process in design. This discipline's relationship to the frontiers of human knowledge is tenuous and unsophisticated. If it is to become more than a "handmaiden" to the symbols of good taste, we must be capable of de- veloping the bold tools and more comprehensive knowledge which will keep us "operational" amidst the dynamics of a highly complex on-going cultural system-one which must soon face unprecedented complexity in shaping the supporting environment. One aspect of this is the capability of operating and communicating on higher levels of abstraction. In fact, our whole mode of inquiry must now shift. We must identify a viable epistemology and evolve a "language of design," a language not of products, as in the past, but of processes; a language which accommodates, demands rather personal invention of great insight toward well-formulated goals. This book by Alexander is the first of its kind addressed to architectural designers. It is likely to have a signifi- cant influence because its appearance is timely and 62</page><page sequence="2">it raises precisely those questions which must be dealt with now. The building of (mathematical) models has be- come a high art, not only in science per se but in several areas where increasing decision-making pre- cision has been required. We can expect this activity to intensify within this discipline also, not just be- cause model building has become fashionable but because of the demands of new dimensions in our problems. The function of a (mathematical) model is that of conceptualizing a portion of the real world and studying its behavior under changing conditions. On a symbolic level, we not only get a clearer picture of the phenomena we are studying but can manipu- late the structure-giving elements with great precision and economy. Also, "The model saves us from self- deception. Forced into the open, our ideas may flutter helplessly; but at least we can see what bloodless creatures they really are." (A. Kaplan, "The Conduct of Inquiry.") Alexander's investigation is not, as many naive skeptics have contended and will contend, an at- tempt to "design buildings with computers," render a "design formula," undermine "personal choice" or guarantee "great buildings." It is an attempt to examine extant decision-making processes in design and to suggest a way of looking at, or formulating, design problems in such a manner as to screen in- hibiting personal bias from certain aspects of the process. Like mathematics itself, he is describing a tool; good tools can be used badly, and the success or failure of the designed environment will remain, as always, a human responsibility. Alexander's argument, as I understand it, develops somewhat as follows: The general problem of design in this historical situation is the increasing complexity of design problems. This complexity, together with the intrinsic inability of the cognitive apparatus of the designer to manipulate large numbers of vari- ables results in a general "lack of clarity" in the forms we produce and a collection of befuddled de- signers hiding their inabilities in a "frenzy of artistic individuality." The author attacks the champions of anti-analysis and intuition among designers and explains to the uninitiated the tools of modern mathe- matics and (inductive) logic. "Enormous resistance to the idea of systematic processes of design is com- ing from people who recognize correctly the impor- tance of intuition but then make a fetish of it, which excludes the possibility of asking reasonable ques- tions." The world is nonhomogeneous as a result of "forces" in the environment. "Form is a result of such forces." The forms produced by us mortals ostensibly lack physical clarity because programmatic clarity is lacking in the "designer's mind." The ob- jective is to find a method for stating design prob- lems "which draws attention to their functional origins and makes their pattern (the topography of forces) reasonably easy to see." The design problem is one in which our purpose is to achieve "fitness" between two entities: the form in question and its context. (This, it should be noted, is tautological.) These, in combination, form the ensemble. The validity of this design ensemble can- not be measured outside the ensemble but by a con- dition of fit or "effortless contact," which must oc- cur at "several boundaries within the ensemble, in concert." The quality of the ensemble is difficult to test. We could place the form in its real world con- text, ie trial and error, which is precisely what we do now; or we could construct (symbolically) a "com- plete unitary field description" of the context, which is impossible. We would like to replace the real world context with a symbolic representation, but we can only attack the problem at the level of bounded rationality, ie "satisficing" (H. A. Simon, "Models of Man"). The task of design is not to meet certain conditions (of a complete unitary field de- scription) but to create such an order, ie removal of all "misfits," in the ensemble that the variables at all boundary conditions are in a state of non-conflict. The process is one of adaptation toward equilibrium. The interactions among variables are denoted as inter-variable ("causal") links ("lingering in the background"). When these linkages or interactions become (numerically) dense, they form discrete, hierarchal, subsystems. To get an accurate picture of the problems structure is to have an understanding of the system's subsystems on all levels. The designer, besides lacking the cognitive capacity to manipulate such complexity, is inhibited by a clumsy and biased language for describing the structure of design prob- lems. "His concepts and categories besides being arbitrary and unsuitable, are self-perpetrating. Under the influence of such concepts, he not only does things from a biased point of view, but sees them biasedly as well." The fundamental impediment is that the complex- ity of the problem is never fully disentangled. One solution is to construct a symbolic representation of the problem's structure. This picture of the problem, to be useful, must be articulated in terms of "pre- cisely definable operations," devoid of the bias of ordinary language. This symbolic conceptualization of the problem is built out of mathematical entities, ie sets, and the analytical process is called decom- position. The decomposition reveals the "hierarchal nesting of sets within sets." These subsystems or subsets are a function of the density of interaction or linkages: "As few links should exist between the subsystems (subsets) as possible (ideally none) . . . We may assume that the density of the interaction resides in a particularly strong identifiable physical aspect of the problem." The decomposed problem is the program. It is "a reorganization of the way the designer thinks about a problem ... it gives us a series of subproblems and tells us in what order to solve them." For every problem the program, and thus the solution, is unique. The synthesizing process is accomplished by in- terpreting the decomposed subsystems of the pro- gram into a series of constructive diagrams, each of which has the quality of integrality into higher order diagrams (as per the hierarchal decomposition) which becomes more complex "as the program di- rects." A constructive diagram is one which connotes both formal and functional characteristics and thus 63</page><page sequence="3">the "gross pattern aspects of the form," ie a "unified description." While the supporting details, ie the paradigms, graphic and mathematical descriptions, are necessary to understand fully this conceptualiza- tion of the processes of design, this hopefully reveals the "gross pattern aspects" of the argument. While the syntax of the conceptualized model of the process seems reasonably sound, I submit that the epistemology is less so. The general orientation strangly suggests that of rarefied object-making. Such an orientation is clearly inconsistent with the kinds of problems with which we are confronted in this culturological situation. The complexity which Alex- ander appropriately identifies is born not simply of quantity and available time but also of expanding knowledge which is relevant to the designer's domain. The object-making orientation not only tends to gen- erate a misconception of the nature of environmen- tal problems, but also impedes implementation of certain aspects of the model itself. What is the stated premise? "The ultimate object of design is form." This is a traditional premise, to be sure, but one which deserves serious re-examina- tion. Indeed one of my colleagues was recently moved to ask: "What is the function of architectural form?" A seemingly banal assertion in the appendix notes makes the author's position quite clear: ". . . what has the fact that we (humans) have ears have to do with the problem's causal structure?" Actually, Alex- ander expresses no great concern that the designed environment is grossly inefective in accommodating the multi-level needs of either aggregates or individ- ual human members of the culture(s). He is dis- mayed only that the solutions lack "formal clarity." This stated position, along with systematic references to "good forms," "bad forms," "great forms," etc, is illuminating. Notwithstanding the form-context identification, the underlying Platonic implications in this work are difficult to overlook. More important, however, is the contingent quasi-technical misunder- standing of relevant design variables and objectives. To follow the point a bit further, attention is drawn to the paradigmatic identification of the "func- tional origins of form," eg iron filings in a magnetic field," "the milk splash," "the (inevitable) soap bubble." There are certainly "forces" acting through- out the environment, but only a small portion of those which impinge upon the "self-conscious" process of designing an environment for humans are of the same class as those which form the soap bubble. The information we have to guide us in accommodating the human organism with an environment amounts to something less than folk-wisdom. The more legiti- mate aspects of our dissatisfaction with extant form- making focuses on this precise point and not simply the clarity of the forms per se. For the present, we can only assert what form an environment ought to take (likewise a "constructive diagram"). Alexander JOURNAL admittedly resists the direct assertion, but like the fashionable anthropomorphic conceptualizations of design, even the mildest inference that the "forces" acting upon iron filings in a magnetic field are of the same class which form the human environment, in this cultural context at least, is critically erroneous. The most interesting issue perhaps centers around the level at which one should enter the design problem. The author avoids discussing the criteria for isolating the problem domain entirely, and the method of identifying variables within that domain is not sufficiently explicit, ie "the designer must trace the problem to its functional origins." The only modus operandi presented is that the elements should be: equal in scope, conceptually independent and as small as possible. This is essentially the case, but determination of the class of data which is to be admitted is fundamental, and this was ignored. Re- ducing the problem to its simples or units could be a formidable task, as would be the process of closure. While it is too tedious a point to develop here, I suggest that the difficulties of identifying the syntacti- cal glue necessary for the decomposition operation grow out of this very ambiguity. Needless to say, these criticisms in no way affect the formal proper- ties of the theoretical model per se. Models are in- different to the conceptualization of variables manip- ulated, which is the only reason they are useful. Only the input and breadth of objective consideration are in question. The concept of the "misfit variable," first en- countered in chapter 2 and thereafter, seems both redundant and confusing. Within a contextural do- main certain requirements, ie variables, are identi- fied; some of these interact when they localize in some physical aspect of the problem. The state of these variables is unresolved until equilibrium is established throughout the system or ensemble (see worked example in the appendix). The comments concerning the dilemma faced by "self-conscious" designers, as their problems be- come more complex while their "cognitive capacity" remains constant, is valid and necessary to the argu- ment for more potent analytic tools, but when "cogni- tive" problems of designers and sundry related comments are intermingled with the more technical aspects of the theory, clearly conceived points be- come somewhat obscured. The work presented in this book is not intended to stand as a totally integrated theory but admittedly as notes perhaps eventually leading to one. Although the mode of presentation is decidedly uneven and exhibits many gaps requiring closure, as I am sure the author is well aware, Alexander's assertions are not only challenging and stimulating but informative, as any reasonable member of this discipline will not fail to see.
