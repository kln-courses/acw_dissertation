The second/eighth century Muslim scholar Abu cAbd Allah al-Harit b. Asad al-Muhasibi, was born in Basra around 165/782 but later resided in Baghdad, albeit with a period of exile in Kufa, until his death in 243/857. Al-Muhasibi was also known for his skills in many disciplines, including the Quran, pro phetic narration (hadit) and scholastic theology (Urn al-kaldm), to which a variety of biographical and historical sources testify. It is, however, for his mastery in the field of Islamic spirituality and moral psychology that he is remembered. In this regard he may be considered to be a primer for the development of Islamic mysticism and this is substantiated by his favourable entries in classical Sufi apologetic works such as al-Sulami's (d. 412/1021) Tabaqdt al-Sufiyya,7 the Hilyat al-awliya of Abu Nuaym al-Isfahani (d. 430/1038),8 the Risdlafil-TasawwufoiAbu 1-Qasim al-Qusayri (d. 465/1074)9 and al-Samnfs Tabaqdt al-Kubrd,10 as well as many others.11 6 See al-harit b.

Picken IArabica 55 (2008) 337-361 339 The excellent reputation that al-Muhasibi enjoyed in scholarly circles gene rally and in Sufi circles specifically, may well have survived any controversy that surrounded him if the protagonist who repudiated him had been relati vely unknown, or had been poorly regarded amongst the scholarly elite. However, al-Muhasibi was not spared this luxury, as the detractor in question was none other than Abu cAbd Allah Ahmad b. Hanbal (d. 241/855), the famous traditionist and imam of the Sunni community at the time. Thus, the status of Ibn Hanbal in Muslim society and his reputation as a steadfast, defender of orthodoxy' due to his dogged opposition to the doctrine of the created Quran at the time of the inquisition (al-mihna), meant that anyone who courted his disapproval would be castigated in no uncertain terms and in this sense, al-Muhasibi was no exception. Thus, the rejection of al-Muhasibi is essentially contained in the following narration related to us by al-Hatib al-Bagdadi (d. 463/1071) in his Tdrih: Muhammad b. Ahmad b. Ya'qub informed me that Muhammad b. Nairn al Dabbi said that I heard al-imam Abu Bakr Ahmad b. Ishaq?meaning al-Sibgi? say that I heard Isma ll b. Ishaq al-Sarrag say, Ahmad b. Hanbal said to me one day, "It has reached me that al-Harit?meaning al-Muhasibi?frequents your company, so would you bring me to your house and allow me to sit, such that he can't see me but I can listen to his discourse?" so I replied, "Your word is my com mand O Abu cAbd Allah!" This initiative from Abu 'Abd Allah pleased me and so I made for al-Harit and requested him to attend that night and said, "And ask your companions to come with you." He replied, "O Ismail, they are many so do not give them more than pressed oil (kusb) and dates, or otherwise more than that you will not be able." So I carried out all that he had commanded me and went to Abu cAbd Allah and informed him, who came after the sunset prayer (al-magrib) and ascended to a room in the house, where he busied himself with reading a portion of the Qur'an (wird) until he had finished. Al-Harit and his companions then came, ate and stood for the evening prayer (al-atamd) and they prayed no further prayer after it. They then sat in front of al-Harit silently; not one of them said a word until almost half the night had passed, when one of them asked al Harit a question and he began to speak whilst his companions listened attenti vely, some of them weeping and others crying out during his discourse. Then, I went up to check on Abu Abd Allah and found that he had wept until he lost consciousness, so I went back to them and they remained in this state until the morning, when they stood and went on their separate ways. I then went back up to Abu Abd Allah and his state had changed and I asked him, "How did you find them O Abu Abd Allah?" To which he replied, "I don't think that I have seen a people such as these nor anyone speak regarding the realties [of faith] (al-haqaiq) like this man, yet despite what I have said, I do not think that you should keep their company." Then he stood and left.12 12 See al-Bagdadi, Tarih Bagdad, VIII, pp. 214-15; Abd al-Rahman b. 'All b. Muhammad Ibn al-Gawzi, Mandqib al-Imdm Ahmad b. Hanbal, ed. 'Abd Allah b. 'Abd al-Muhsin al-Turkl</page><page sequence="4">340 G. Picken lArabica 55 (2008) 337-361 It is this peculiar anecdotal statement, which has set into motion the debate regarding Ibn Hanbals censuring of al-Muhasibi.13 The story itself is difficult to qualify as it contains many apparent contradictions. Firstly, as unlikely as it may seem, the first step in the story is taken by Ibn Hanbal himself by instiga ting the secretive observance of al-Muhasibi s teaching of his disciples and upon hearing his discourse, he is not only suitably impressed with its content but moreover, is overcome with emotion whilst listening to it. Similarly, he seemingly endorses the content of the discourse and states his approval of its originator and his associates, yet in the very same sentence he considers this form of instruction unsuitable for the very man who arranged his attendance at al-Muhasibi s night vigil. Thus, the semiotics of this narrative prove virtually indecipherable and as such, have produced a great deal of debate regarding the nature of Ibn Hanbal s dislike of al-Muhasibi s method and teaching, which will be categorised and will be summarised here in the following sections. Al-Muhasibi's Method was Innovative {bid a) One of the popular views expressed regarding the dispute between Ibn Hanbal and al-Muhasibi is that the former scholar considered both al-Muhasibi s approach and methodology innovative {bid'a) in a pejorative sense. Although there is no direct statement from Ibn Hanbal on this particular issue regarding al-Muhasibi, we find some evidence to suggest this from various indirect sour ces. For example, one of Ibn Hanbal's more celebrated students was Abu Zur'a 1-RazI (d. 264/878), who, when he asked concerning al-Muhasibi and his books, as al-Hatib informs us in his Tdrih&gt; said: and All Muhammad 'Umar, Cairo, Maktabat al-Hangi, 1979, pp. 239-40; al-Dahabl, Tarih al-Isldm, XVIII, p. 208; Mizdn al-i tidalfi naqd al-rigdl, I, p. 430; al-Subkl, Tabaqdt al-Sdfi'iyya l-kubrd, II, p. 279; al-Saranl, al-Tabaqdt al-Kubrd, I, p. 64 and al-Bundanigi, Garni al-Anwdrfi mandqib al-ahydr, pp. 291-2. 13 The peculiarity of the story is pointed out by al-Dahabi who states, "Isma ll [b. Ishaq al Sarrag] was considered reliable by al-Daraqutnl and this story is authentic in its chain of trans mission {sahihat al-sanad) but rejected (munkara); it doesn't find acceptance in my heart and I consider it highly unlikely that something like this would be done by Ahmad." In addition, the final part of the story is even more peculiar in al-Bundanigi's version where he claims that Ibn Hanbal said, "It has reached me that there are circles of remembrance (magdlis al-dikr) in which people gather and if these are such circles, then I do not disavow anything of them." See al-Dahabi, Mizdn al-i tidal ft naqd al-rigdl, I, p. 430 and al-Bundanigi, Garni al-Anwdrfi mandqib al-ahydr, p. 292.</page><page sequence="5">G. Picken lArabica 55 (2008) 337-361 341 Do not dare read such books (iyydka wa-hddihi -l-kutub)\ They are books of inno vation and misguidance (bidd wa-daldldt). Concern yourself only with transmis sion (al-atar) as you will find within it that which will suffice you of such works." It was said to him that within such books one may find beneficial lessons {'ibra) to which he replied, "Whoever does not find beneficial lessons in the Book of Allah, Exalted is He, then he will find no such beneficial lesson in these books either. Has it reached you that Malik b. Anas or Sufyan al-Tawri or al-Awza i or any of the previous imams wrote books about fleeting thoughts (al-hatardt), Sata nic insinuation (al-wasdwis) and other such things? They are a people who have contradicted the people of knowledge (ahlal-ilm); one time they come to us with al-Harit al-Muhasibi, another with Abd al-Rahlm al-Dubayli, another with Hatim al-Asamm and yet another with Saqiq [al-Balhl]." Then he said, "How swift people are in turning to innovation!14 The polarised view presented here is indicative of the stance adopted by many of the traditionists of the time and the significance of the phraseology cannot be underestimated. Al-Razi begins with a strict censuring of approaching such works, clarifying that as far as he was concerned they are nothing more than books that contain erroneous teachings and conjecture. The 'true' methodo logy is consequently elucidated as being a strict and uncompromising adhe rence to both the Qur an and the prophetic practice, as laid down in the hadit literature, which is further evidenced by the fact that none of the earlier scho lars contributed in terms of written treatises other than in these two primary fields of Islamic learning. Thus, we are left with the impression of a clash of methodologies, in the sense that the works and subject matter of al-Muhasibi and others of his ilk were simply unheard of and as such, constituted a departure from the tea chings of the previous, exemplary generations. The context of this clash is further illustrated by the terms "... fleeting thoughts {al-hatardt), satanic insi nuation {al-wasdwis) and other such things...", which indicates that the inner workings of the human being were not a subject for discussion and the dismis sive nature of the phraseology indicates the speaker's contempt for such issues. The people {qawm) involved in this field of enquiry are also alluded to and in addition to al-Muhasibi, include other luminaries who were to be found later in the ranks of celebrated Sufis and al-Razi also clarifies his contempt for the new' spiritual and mystical direction taken by some sections of Islam's scho larly community. 14 See al-Bagdadi, Tarih Bagdad, VIII, p. 215; Abd al-Rahman b.

Picken IArabica 55 (2008) 337-361 It is interesting to note that despite being al-Razi's teacher, Ibn Hanbal is not mentioned here amongst the other eminent jurists or traditionists of the time. Nevertheless, we can assume that Ibn Hanbal's methodology did not differ drastically from his contemporaries as we find that his teacher, the cele brated traditionist cAbd al-Rahman b. Mahdi (d. 198/814) is reported to have said, "It is forbidden for a man to speak regarding an issue of religion except [he bases it on] something that he heard from a reliable narrator (tiqa)"15 In a comparable statement, Ibn Hanbal himself said to al-Maymunl, "O Abu 1 Hasan do not dare speak on an issue unless you have a proof {imam) regarding it."16 Similarly, when asked regarding the issue of fleeting thoughts (al-hatardt) and satanic insinuation (al-wasdwis) mentioned above, he is reported to have replied, "Neither the Companions or the Successors spoke regarding them."17 Illustrating this point further, Ibn Ragab al-Hanbali ['Abd al-Rahman b. Sihab al-Din] (d. 795/1393) states: Ahmad and others only censured those amongst the Sufis who discussed fleeting thoughts {al-hatardt) and satanic insinuation (al-wasdwis), as their statements in this regard were not based on any legal evidence (dalil sari) but rather, [were based] on personal opinion and experiential knowledge (ray wa-dawq). Similarly, he would reject statements on issues of the permissible and the forbidden (al-haldl wa-l-hardm) based purely upon personal opinion (ray) without any legal proof.18 In addition to the discussion regarding various aspects of the esoteric and psychological religious life, Ibn Katlr (d. 774/1372) adds a further possibility for the proposal that Ibn Hanbal rejected al-Muhasibi on the basis of innova tive practice, saying: Indeed, he [Ahmad] disliked that because their discourse contained aspects of asceticism and extreme behaviour that had no legal basis and a precise form of introspective examination, that was meticulous and exaggerated but which had not been commanded. Due to this when Abu Zura 1-Razi read al-Harit's book entitled al-Ridya he said, "This is innovation (bid*a)" and said to the man who brought the book, "You should follow that which Malik, al-Tawri, al-Awza I and al-Layt followed and leave this, as indeed it is innovation."19 15 Al-Isfahani, Hilyat al-awliya, IX, p. 6. 16 Ibn al-Gawzi, Mandqib al-Imdm Ahmad b. Hanbal, p. 231. 17 Ibid., p. 232. 18 Abd al-Rahman b. Sihab al-Din [Ibn Ragab] al-Hanbali, Garni al-Ulum wa-l-hikam ft sarh hamsin hadit min gawdmi al-kalim, ed.

Picken I' Arabica 55 (2008) 337-361 343 Upon examining these various views regarding al-Muhasibi's practice and methodology we find that they are far more difficult to prove than one might at first imagine. Regarding Abu Zur a 1-Razi's censuring of al-Muhasibi, in which he states that one must restrict one's learning to the Qur an and hadit, then of course when examining al-Muhasibi's works we find a great deal of personal introspection is evident. However, at the same time what we also find that he includes a plethora of Qur5an verses and multifarious hadit, many of which he transmitted personally, to add form, structure and authenticity to his writings. Thus, the claim that al-Muhasibi's teachings existed outside the sphere of the Islamic paradigm is for the most part, simply erroneous. The next accusation from al-Razi's perspective that none of the previous scholars had written on the topic of fleeting thoughts (al-hatardi), satanic insi nuation (al-wasdwis) and Ibn Hanbal's perspective that both the Companion and Successor generations had not discussed this, is equally misleading. The fact that a topic had not been discussed in a written form in the formative generations of Muslims does not necessarily mean that they were not aware of it and indeed, the traditional Muslim view holds that many of the religious disciplines that became an intrinsic part of learning were not discussed in the technical sense they inferred at a later date. Thus, from the traditional Islamic perspective an example of this includes the principles of Islamic juris prudence (usul al-fiqh), which had been utilised practically from the time of the Companions but did not reach fruition until its codification in al-SafiTs (d. 204/820) al-Risdla. Other examples include the various hadit disciplines that both Ibn Hanbal and al-Razi would have been familiar with, such as hadit terminology (mustalah al-hadit) and the biographical tabaqdt and rigal genres, which were developed purely to authenticate hadit and which, had not been fully developed even in the time of these two eminent traditionists. Similarly, the most controversial religious incident of the period, the mihna, was driven by an issue never discussed in the initial generations of Muslims, i.e. that of the created Qur'an and indeed, Ibn Hanbal himself engaged? admittedly under duress?in this debate to defend the orthodox' view. Thus, we can conclude that the fact that an earlier generation of scholars did not discuss a topic does not exclude its inclusion in a later scholarly tradition. As such, the topic in question, i.e. the introspective thought process is in fact alluded to in the Qur'an, in the following verse, "Indeed, We created the human being and We know that which whispers in his own soul; We are closer to him than his jugular vein" (50, 16). This being the case and in addition to the body of material related in Qur an and hadit regarding the human soul,20 20 See for example: Gavin Picken, "Tazkiyat al-Nafs: The Quranic Paradigm", Journal of Quranic Studies, Villi (2005), pp. 101-127 and The Concept of Tazkiyat al-Nafs in Islam in the</page><page sequence="8">344 G. Picken lArabica 55 (2008) 337-361 this provided al-Muhasibi the theoretical, practical and legal basis for much of what he dedicated his life and works. In addition, the notion that Ibn Hanbal rejected al-Muhasibi on the basis of his extreme asceticism is equally questionable, as the biographical material dealing with Ahmad's life is replete with examples of his own extreme asceti cism, which also on occasion seems beyond the normal boundaries of religious practice.21 This otherworldliness' of Ibn Hanbal is so celebrated to the extent that even the Sufi apologetic works include anecdotes from him in this regard as al-Qusayri's al-Risdla contains the following narration: Ahmad b. Hanbal said, "Asceticism (al-zuhd) is of three types: the first is to leave that which is forbidden (al-hardm) and this is the asceticism of the common folk (al-awdmm). The second is to leave that which is superfluous from the permissi ble (fadl al-haldl) and this is the asceticism of the elite (al-hawdss). The third is to leave that which occupies the devotee from any other than God the Exalted and this is the asceticism of the gnostics (al-arifiri) !ni Thus, in summary we may conclude that the basis of the argument posited to prove al-Muhasibi's unorthodox' teaching is at best contentious and rather than being indicative of his innovative practice, could equally be viewed as being a by-product of the rigidity of the traditionist faction that was in the ascendancy in the post-mihna period. One of the major factors in this stance adopted by this traditionist faction?also referred to as the Handbila23? seemingly arises from their interpretation of what constitutes innovation, in the sense that from the statements of both Ibn Hanbal and al-Razi it seems to Light of the Works of al-Harith al-Muhasibi, unpublished PhD Thesis, Leeds, the University of Leeds, 2005, pp. 83-90. 21 See al-Isfahani, Hilyat al-awliyd\ IX, pp. 145-201 passim-, Ibn al-GawzI, Mandqib al-Imdm Ahmad b. Hanbal, pp. 255-260; Walter M. Patton, Ahmed Ibn Hanbal and the Mihna, Leiden, EJ. Brill, 1897, pp. 139-172 passim, 178-182, and Michael Cooperson, Classical Arabic Biogra phy.

Hanbal, as well as being used to infer an uncompromising and rigid position on religious matters. What we can say here, however, is that the phrase when used to describe certain sections of society at the time of al-Muhasibi did not refer to the school of jurisprudence, as this had yet to be formed but rather, the theological stance adopted by Ibn Hanbal against the Mu'tazilites and perhaps, a dogmatic and obdurate attitude' that accompanied it amongst Ahmad's followers. See Muhammad Abu Zahra, Ibn Hanbal. Haydtuhu wa-asruhu wa-arauhu wa-fiqhuhu, pp. 356-65 and Henri Laoust, "Hanabila", The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Leiden-London, E. J.

Picken IArabica 55 (2008) 337-361 345 infer a practice or belief that either contradicts the religious praxis and creedal system of the earliest generations, or indeed, topics that were never discussed by them. Thus, their understanding of the term bid 'a was in reality very res tricted and limiting and it may well have been the case that al-Muhasibl understood bid'a to be a practice or belief that had no basis or precedent in the revelatory sources of the Qur an and hadit, rather than his contemporaries' rigid interpretation. As such, the source of this dispute is in fact a methodolo gical one, on the one hand between a group of scholars whose world view was extremely obdurate and uncompromising, rejecting outright any teaching which in their view contradicted their system, or indeed was simply new' and on the other, a scholar who having grounded his teaching in the primary sour ces, aimed to treat the moral and psychological ailments of his peers. Finally and perhaps most importantly, this view does not solve the conun drum of the original narration related by al-Hatib, if one bears in mind the strictness of the stance of the Hanbali/traditionist faction to bid'a generally and the position of Ibn Hanbal in particular,24 which is that if Ibn Hanbal had considered al-Muhasibi's discourse so innovative, as we are lead to believe, then why did he stay until the morning listening to it? The uncompromising nature of Ibn Hanbal on such an issue would lead us to imagine that he would not have stayed even a moment longer than necessary, if this was really the case and therefore, we must consider other possibilities in this regard. Al-Muhasibi and Ibn Hanbal were Contemporaneous (aqrdn) Of the less popular explanations for Ibn Hanbal's dislike of al-Muhasibi is that they were contemporaries who may have disagreed upon an issue of religious knowledge which in turn, led to a dispute of a personal nature, causing Ibn Hanbal to react in the way that he did. In this regard, Islamic scholarship, particularly in the field of hadit through the genre of literature dealing with the disparagement and acceptability of narrators known as al-garh wa-l-tddiU has discussed incidents of such a nature and developed its own particular stance regarding it. Accordingly, we find the following statement from al Subki: So it is appropriate for you, O seeker of guidance (al-mustarsid) that you adopt the correct etiquette with the previous scholars (al-aimma) and do not look at the statements of some of them regarding others except if they produce clear 24 For examples of Ibn Hanbal's treatment of'innovators' see Ibn al-Gawzi, Mandqib al-Imdm Ahmad b.

Thus, if you are able to interpret [such incidents] or have a good opi nion (husn al-zann) [regarding them] then do so, otherwise 'turn a blind eye'25 regarding what occurred between them as you were not created for this purpose and concern yourself with that which concerns you and do not concern yourself with that which does not. A student of knowledge (tdlib al-ilm) remains noble in my sight until he delves into that which occurred between the predecessors and judges [in favour] of some rather than others. So dare not incline [to one or the other] in that which occurred between Abu Hanlfa and Sufyan al-Tawrl, or Malik [b. Anas] and Abu Di'b, or Ahmad b. Salih and al-Nasa i, or al-Harit al-Muhasibi and Ahmad b. Hanbal, which continued until the time of Ibn Abd al-Salam and al-Taqi b. al-Salah. As indeed, if you busied yourself with this I fear for your des truction! These people were renowned scholars (al-dimma), their statements may be interpreted in more than one way and perhaps some of them were not unders tood. As such, we can do nothing except be pleased with them and be silent regarding what occurred between them in the same way that we do regarding that which occurred between the Companions, may God be pleased with them.26 Thus, we can see from al-Subkl's comments that with regard to disputes between scholarly personalities, including that which occurred between al-Muhasibi and Ibn Hanbal, he adopts a non-inflammatory approach, which attempts to diffuse the situation. It is interesting to note, however, that there is an exception to this approach which is indicated by the phrase, "... except if they produce clear evidence (burhan wadiBf\ a factor that up until now in the texts pre viously quoted, Ibn Hanbal has not alluded to. Similarly, it is equally interesting to note that al-Subki also attempts to diffuse the situation further and maintain reverence for such luminaries by suggesting that in some cases the reasons behind the discourse of certain scho lars are difficult to discern, indicated by the phrase, "These people were renowned imams, their statements may be interpreted in more than one way and perhaps some of them were not understood." In the particular case under discussion here, i.e. the dispute between al-Muhasibi and Ibn Hanbal, this is certainly the case as Ibn Hanbal did not qualify further his statement, ".. .yet despite what I have said, I do not think that you should keep their company" and this is equally demonstrated by the number of opinions and amount of discussion that this comment has generated. 25 The literal translation of the term used would be 'to turn one's cheek away (fa-drib safhan 'an)' meaning not to even look but I have used 'turn a blind eye', which appears a useful equiva lent in English. 26 See Abd al-Wahhab b.

As such, the statement oial-imdm Malik [b. Anas] regar ding Muhammad b. Ishaq?the author of al-Magazl?that he was a "deceiving charlatan" (daggdl min al-dagdgila) is not accepted... [Similarly] al-Nasai's vilification (qadh) of Ahmad b. Salih al-Misri, or [Sufyan] al-Tawri's vilification of Abu Hanlfa, or [Yahya] Ibn Main's vilification of al-SafiT, or Ahmad's vilification of al-Harit al-Muhasibi would also not be accepted... So do not dare delve into that which occurred between Abu Hanlfa and Sufyan... or between Ahmad and al-Harit al-Muhasibi.27 As such, al-LuknawI goes a step further than the non-inflammatory approach of al-Subki inferring that not only should such disparaging or ambiguous sta tements of scholars regarding their peers be overlooked' but that they should even be rejected due to the underlying reasons for such comments being not only contentious but possibly even occurred as a result of personal dislike. Thus, according to al-Luknawi, Ibn Hanbal's comment regarding al-Muhasibi may be cast aside altogether because it is impossible to know the true reasons behind it. Shedding further light on this al-Subki comments, "And what must also be taken into consideration?and, as sayh al-Isldm Ibn Daqiq al-'Id has pointed out?is the dispute that occurred between many of the Sufis and the traditio nists (ashdb al-hadit), as indeed many of them imposed statements regarding one another, as some of them did regarding al-Harit al-Muhasibi and others."28 Thus, we are given the impression that due to the methodological differences alluded to above, many traditionists often deprecated those they considered 'Sufis' and as such, when examining the disputes between scholars of these two denominations this factor must be taken into consideration. Therefore, the inference here is also that the comments of traditionists regarding other non traditionists and Sufis in particular, should be rejected due to the nature of the methodological dispute between them. 27 Abd al-Hayy al-Luknawi, al-Raft wa-l-takmilft l-garh wa-l-tddil, ed.

Hanbal due to his extreme adherence to the prophetic practice (al-sunna) and his forbidding of innovation (al-bid'a) criticised a number of the elite (al-ahydr), if they did anything that contradicted the sunna and his statements in this regard should be interpreted as providing good counsel in religious matters (al-nasiha li-l-din).29 Thus, from the above statement even Ibn al-Gawzi admits that, due to his own strict interpretation and application of Islamic principles, Ibn Hanbal would disparage those whom he considered to contradict such fundamentals, despite their being from the scholarly ranks of the community "al-ahydr". However, rather than interpreting this tendency as a case of, "... providing good counsel in religious matters (al-nasiha li-l-din)", as Ibn al-Gawzi has done, one may equally interpret this in the light of the discussion above, provided by traditio nists dealing with the discipline of al-garh wa-l-tddil, as being the result of a stance taken due to a different methodological approach being adopted. Further clarifying the concept amongst scholarship that there was almost a natural' departure between the traditionists and the 'Sufis', al-Dahabi, having quoted the remarks made by al-Razi,30 comments in his Mizdn al-i 'tidal. Where are the likes of al-Harit al-Muhasibi?! How then if Abu Zura had seen the books of the later Sufis, such as the Qut al-qulub of Abu Talib [al-Makki] and where are the likes of the Quitl How then if he had seen Bahgat al-asrdr of Abu Gahdam, and Haqaiq al-tafiir of al-Sulami?! He would have lost his mind (la-tdra lubbuhu)\ How then if he had seen the works of Abu Hamid [al-Gazzall] al-Tusi bearing in mind the many fabricated hadit (al-mawduat) there are in al-IhyaV. How then if he had seen al-Gunya ofsayh Abd al-Qadir [al-Gllani] ?! How then if he had seen Fusils al-hikam and al-Futuhdt al-makkiyya [of Ibn ArabI] ?! Indeed when al-Harit was the spokesman of such people in his era (lisdn al-qawm ft ddlika l-asr), his contemporaries consisted of one thousand scholars of hadit, including the likes of Ahmad b. Hanbal and Ibn Rahawayh but when the pole of Gnostics (qutb al-drifin) became the author of al-Fusus [i.e. Ibn ArabI] the scholars of [in that time] were the likes of Ibn Walad al-Hamsin and Ibn Sahana.31 On examining this excerpt in the light of the quote from al-Razi, we may conclude that, even if al-Dahabi accepted his claim that al-Muhasibi was a 29 Ibn al-GawzI, Mandqib al-Imdm Ahmad b.

Picken lArabica 55 (2008) 337-361 349 proponent of innovation, he clearly thought that al-Muhasibi's bid'a was insignificant compared with the 'innovations' of the later exponents of Sufism, to the extent that he concludes that, if al-Razi had encountered these later works he would have gone insane! Similarly, al-Dahabi also takes into conside ration the factors of space and time, in the sense that he attempts to make an appraisal of al-Muhasibi within his own historical context. This being the case, he quite correctly notes that this era was the golden age of traditionism' to the extent that not only was the vast majority of scholarship was concerned with the transmission and authenticating of narrations but also that this period contained many of the authorities in the field of hadit, who would be considered its greatest exponents and experts for centuries to come. Thus, bearing this factor in mind and also taking into consideration the clash of methodologies' between the traditionists and other sections of the scholarly community, it is hardly surprising that al-Muhasibi came under scrutiny and consequently, incurred the wrath of the hadit experts who were in the ascen dancy in the post-mihna period. In a similar vein, further accentuating the clash of methodologies' between the traditionists and the nascent Sufi fraternity, Ibn Haldun (d. 808/1406) comments in his Sifa al-sail: The basis of the story between al-Muhasibi and Ibn Hanbal, was Ibn Hanbal's belief that it is not permissible for someone studying Sacred Law (al-sand) to have a sayh to whom he submits his affairs but rather that acquisition [of knowledge] should be from the Book [i.e. the Qur an] and the Prophetic example (al-sunna) [directly] ,32 As such, this is a further indication of the disparate approaches of these two scholars, which appear on the surface to have created an unsolvable rift between them. Therefore, at least from a superficial perspective, the fact that these two eminent Muslim personalities were contemporaneous may be a possible cause of their discord. However, I would suggest here that there is little indication that the dispute in question was in fact fuelled by personal feelings, but rather, that their methodologies of religious practice were entirely different, as was shown in this section and even more so in section above dealing with the contention that al-Muhasibi's method was innovative (bid'a). Despite this, however, there remains yet another major factor in the relationship between 32 'Abd al-Rahman b. Muhammad b. Muhammad Ibn Haldun, Sifa al-sail ft tahdib al masail, ed. Ignatiyus 'Abduh Halifa 1-Yasu'i, Beirut, al-Matba'a 1-katullkiyya, n.d., p. 64 quoted in al-Muhasibi, al-Aql wa-Fahm al-Qurdn, ed. al-Quwatll, p. 45.</page><page sequence="14">350 G. Picken IArabica 55 (2008) 337-361 al-Muhasibi and Ibn Hanbal and since this is arguably the most important it will be dealt with at length in the next section. Al-Muhasibi's Utilisation of Scholastic Theology (iltn al-kaldm) Of the most popular and regularly cited reasons for Ibn Hanbal's abjuration of al-Muhasibi is the suggestion that Ahmad's dislike of al-Harit stems from the latter's utilisation of scholastic theology (Urn al-kaldm) and in particular, in refuting unorthodox' views, especially those of the Mu'tazilites and Si'ites.33 The fact that al-Muhasibi employed dialectical and rational argument in some of his works is well established, as this technique is tangible during his discus sion of the aforementioned sects within a minority of his works, namely in particular Mdhiyyat al-aql and Fahm al-Qurdn.34 Therefore, this suggestion requires further qualification not from the perspective of al-Muhasibi as his use of kaldm is known, but rather, one has to first clarify Ibn Hanbal's view of this subject, so as to establish the validity of this concept. In fact, upon examining the classical biographical and historical sources, one finds a trend amongst the more strict traditionist and jurisprudential ranks towards vehement censuring of the use of 'ilm al-kaldm in any format and under any circumstance. As such, we find that when it was said to one of Ibn Hanbal's teachers, 'Abd al-Rahman b. Mahdi (d. 198/814), "Such and such (fuldn) has authored a book regarding the sunna as a refutation against someone else", he replied, "Did he refute [him] with the Book of God [i.e. the Qur an] and the practice of His Prophet (sunnat nabiyyihi), may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him?" It was said to him, "[He refuted him] with scholastic theology (kaldm)", to which he replied, "Then he has refuted false hood with falsehood (bdtil bi-bdtil)."55 Thus, we find that this view?repre sentative of the traditionist stance towards kaldm?not only rejected it as a method since it was considered falsehood (bdtil) but moreover, its use was 33 It is worth noting here that al-Hatib contends that there are theological issues other than those alluded to in this section, in which al-Muhasibi contradicts the creed of orthodox' Sun nism. However, most of these are derived by examining al-Muhasibi's views from his works, in particular Fahm al-Qurdn, whereas the goal of this section is to explore this contention from the classical primary sources as a whole, so as to reach the essence of this dispute.

In a more scathing attack on those who engage in scholastic theology and dialectics, another of Ibn Hanbal's teachers?the renowned jurist Muhammad b. Idris al-SafTl (d. 204/820)?is reported to have said, "No one engaged in kalam and was successful."36 He also said, "For a person to be afflicted with everything that Allah has forbidden apart from polytheism (al-sirk) is better than if he were to engage in al-kalamP7 Similarly, his own judgement regar ding scholastic theology was clear as he stated: My opinion and my position (rdyi wa-madhabi) regarding those who engage in scholastic theology (ashdb al-kaldm) is that they should be beaten with palm bran ches (al-garid), put on camels and paraded amongst the clans and tribes and that it should be proclaimed, "This is the recompense of anyone who left the Book of God [i.e. the Qur an] and the prophetic practice (al-sunna) and engaged in &lt;#/ kaldm."38 As for Ibn Hanbal himself, he had an equally negative view of scholastic theo logy and dialectics, as it is reported that he said, "Do not sit with those who engage in scholastic theology (ahl al-kaldm) even if they defend the Prophetic practice (al-sunna) ,"39 Thus, the traditionists and jurists of the period are portrayed as holding an uncompromising and rigid view regarding both scholastic theology and those who engaged in it. This can be understood in several ways: firstly, they held the view that Islam was a revealed religion and it was to be understood from its revelatory sources, these being entirely sufficient to understand and interpret this religious tradition. Secondly, bearing in mind the 'self sufficient' nature of the revelatory sources, there was simply no need for another interpretative method, such as scholastic theology, to be employed and this being the case, such a subsidiary interpretative method was extraneous and thus, surplus to requirement. Thirdly, since scholastic theology by its very nature relies on dia lectic and rational discourse to prove its point rather than basing an argument exclusively on a Qur'anic verse or prophetic hadit, then such a method had no basis from a religious or legalistic perspective and was to be rejected as innova tion (bid'a), even if it were to employed to defend the orthodox' stance from other 'innovative' sects. Fourthly, such scholars, from their perspective, had seen the 'negative' effect of engaging in kalam, since many of the 'innovations' 36 Ibid, p. 100. 37 Ibid 38 Ibid,pA04. 39 Ibn al-Gawzi, Mandqib al-Imdm Ahmad b. Hanbal, p. 205.</page><page sequence="16">352 G. Picken lArabica 55 (2008) 337-361 of groups such as the Qadarites, Mu'tazilites and the Gahmites had been due to their delving into theological debate on a 'rational' basis rather than a 'revelatory' one, which in many ways ultimately led to the tribulations of the mihna. Therefore, it is hardly surprising that anyone found employing scholastic theology, even if it were to for the noble goal of defending the orthodox' posi tion by using the methods of the unorthodox' against them, was strongly censured and vilified. Similarly, it is equally no surprise that al-Muhasibi was subject to such vilification, as he was clearly involved in the defence of the beliefs of Sunni orthodoxy' by utilising rational and dialectic methods, com parable to those of the sects with whom he was engaged, such as those of the Mu'tazilites. Bearing these factors in mind and despite his non inflammatory' approach to the dispute between Ibn Hanbal and al-Muhasibi alluded to in the afore mentioned discussion, al-Subki also concedes that al-Muhasibi's utilisation of scholastic theology may well have been a factor in this issue, as the following excerpt shows: Know that al-imam Ahmad, may God be pleased with him, was highly critical of anyone who spoke regarding scholastic theology (Urn al-kaldm) out of fear that it would lead to that which is inappropriate. There is little doubt that to remain silent regarding it [kaldm] is preferable provided there is no need to do so and to speak concerning it when there is no need is innovation (bid'a) and al-Harit had indeed spoken on some issues of scholastic theology; Abu 1-Qasim al Nasirabadi said, "It has reached me that Ahmad b. Hanbal repudiated him for this reason." I say: it is presumed that al-Harit only spoke [regarding kaldm] when the need arose.40 Thus, while acknowledging Ibn Hanbal's strict censuring of kaldm under all circumstances due to its potential to open discussions of a theological nature that may even be impermissible or at the very least misleading, al-Subki differentiates between this approach and another, which suggests that scholas tic theology may be employed when the need to do so arises. If no such need arises, however, then to introduce kaldm into the discourse is, according to al-Subki at least, innovative. On this premise al-Subki sets out to defend al-Muhasibi's position by suggesting that he did not engage in dialectical debate for its own sake but rather, when the need arose to defend the Sunni orthodox' position from the onslaught of the rationalising theology of the 40 Al-Subki, Tabaqdt al-Sdfiiyya l-kubrd, II, pp. 278-9.</page><page sequence="17">G. Picken lArabica 55 (2008) 337-361 353 Mutazilites?an objective, as we have already seen, that Ibn Hanbal found equally unacceptable. Arguing from a similar perspective, Abu Hamid al-Gazzali (d. 505/1 111), provides a similar defence of al-Muhasibi's approach. Al-Gazzali in his typi cally lucid style, presents what he considers to be representative of the views of these scholars byway of an imaginary dialogue and then gives his own conclu sion, as we find in the following quote from al-Munqid: Ahmad b. Hanbal rejected al-Harit al-Muhasibi's writing of refutations against the Mutazilites, so al-Harit said, "To refute innovation (al-bid'a) is a compulsory duty (fard)" and Ahmad replied, "Indeed, but you first make mention of their deviant view (subhd) and then you reply to it; what guarantee do you have that someone won't examine this deviant view such that it sticks in his mind and then he will not be attentive to the reply, or give it consideration yet not understand its full significance?" What Ahmad has mentioned is true but only in the case of a deviant view that is not widespread or well known. However, if such a deviant view became well known, then to reply to it is compulsory and it is not possible to reply to it without first making mention of it.41 Therefore, al-Gazzali's first defence of al-Muhasibi's refutations against the Mutazilites comes from a legalistic perspective, i.e. that it is a compulsory duty (fard) to do so, perhaps a view that Ibn Hanbal may even have agreed with, as he himself did so during the mihna. However, according to al-Gazzali, this was not the reason for Ibn Hanbal's censuring of al-Muhasibi but rather, his mentioning of their doctrines before replying to them to refute them, as there is no guarantee that someone reading such an exposition may be convinced by the Mutazilite view before reading the refutation or even be confused by it, such that the specific nature of the reply may not be fully understood. Al-Gazzali contends, however, that this is only true in the case of a deviant view that is not widespread, since in this case mentio ning such a view which is not well known to the public would only cause them further consternation. In the case of the Mutazilites however, the oppo site was true, since their doctrines came into the public domain due to the very nature of the mihna. In this case al-Gazzali suggests that it is a duty to answer such widespread views by refuting them openly and that one can only achieve this by first making mention of such views and then refuting them systematically?a duty that al-Muhasibi gratefully undertook on behalf of his peers. 41 Muhammad b.

Picken I'Arabica 55 (2008) 337-361 Although al-Gazzali's reasoning is apparently sound, his explanation is refu ted by Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328), who sheds further light on this contro versy stating: Ahmad's repudiation of al-Harit was not due to the reason mentioned by Abu Hamid but rather it was because of him adopting the position of Ibn Kullab regarding the correct way of [understanding] divine action (al-harakdt)42 and nature (al-tarkib) ,43 which was in agreement with that of the Mu'tazilites. Howe ver, he [Ibn Kullab] did not agree with them with regard to negating all the divine attributes but rather both he and his associates would affirm that God, the Exal ted, is above His creation, elevated above the world and characterised by attribu tes. They would confirm this via rational proofs even though within his methodology he would negate the occurrence of actions in God, the Exalted's essence and other matters related to divine will (mastatihi) and choice (ihtiydrihi) ,44 It was on this basis that he based his opinion regarding the Qur'an45 and these matters are well known to those who are familiar with the statements of Ahmad from his associates and other scholars of hadlt and sunna.46, 41 Therefore, in Ibn Taymiyya's opinion the dispute between Ibn Hanbal and al Muhasibi was not related to the quotation of heretical beliefs in refutation of their proponents but rather due to a specific stance adopted by al-Muhasibi regarding the nature of God. This view was that divine attributes which mani fest themselves as acts such as will (masta) are not contingent (hddit) as this 42 Ibn Taymiyya appears to be using al-harakdt synonymously with al-af'dl. 43 A more literal translation may be "composition" and this refers to the Mu'tazilite notion that God is "non-composite" (gayr murakkab), since this would denote a complexity and multi plicity that in their view negates the concept of tawhid. In fact, Ibn Taymiyya elaborates on this further suggesting that the Mu'tazilites and those who agree with them did not mean this in the linguistic sense, since he contends that no Muslim has inferred this by using the term "al-tarkib". Rather, he indicates that this actually means that God cannot be perceived through sensory perception and therefore, He cannot be "seen", this in turn being in line with the Mu'tazilite belief that there is no beatific vision in the hereafter, since this would indicate that God has a "position" and a "direction". See Ibn Taymiyya, Ahmad b. Abd al-Hallm [sayh al-Isldm], Bay an talbis al-gahmiyya fi tdsis biddihim al-kalamiyya, ed. Muhammad b. Abd al-Rahman b. Qasim, Mecca, Matba'at al-hukuma, 1972,1, p. 474. 44 In the sense that such actions are temporal and contingent (hadit). 45 It would appear that Ibn Taymiyya is referring to attribution to al-Muhasibl of the opinion that a person's articulation of the Qur'an is created (mahluq), which will be discussed later in the article. 46 This is a further deprecation of al-Gazzali as Ibn Taymiyya considers him ill equipped to deal with the verification of prophetic narrations (ahddit) and historical reports (ahbdr) from the earlier generations. See Ibn Taymiyya, Ahmad b. 'Abd al-Hallm [sayh al-Isldm], Dar tddrudal 'aql wa-l-naql, ed. Muhammad Rasad Salim, Cairo, Dar al-kutub, 1971, VII, p. 149. 47 Ibid., VII, pp. 147-148 and cf.

Picken lArabica 55 (2008) 337-361 355 would mean that the essence of God would be continually changing and since God is not subject to change, this would be impossible. This was not only the opinion held by the group of Sunni scholastic theologians headed by Ibn Kullab (d. ca. 239/854),48 with which al-Muhasibi is commonly associated, but was further complicated by the fact that it was also the stance of Ibn Hanbal's arch enemies the Mu'tazilites. Although this group of theologians, as Ibn Taymiyya suggests, did not go as far as negating every divine attribute as the Mu'tazilites did, this was still a highly problematic position to hold when compared to the stoical dogmatism of Ibn Hanbal. Thus, it was this aberration in belief that Ibn Taymiyya contends was the main reason for Ibn Hanbal's rejection of al-Muhasibi and not his engaging the heretical sects of his time. Indeed, extending this argument further to disprove al-Gazzali's contention he states: Ahmad, may God be pleased with him, has in fact refuted the Gahmiyya and others by the use of revelatory and rational proofs, and at the same time he men tioned their opinions and evidence that others did not.49 Indeed, he presented in great detail their opinions and evidences and then invalidated them by utilising both revelatory and rational proofs.50 With regard to mentioning the views of heretical groups we find a similar perspective from qddi Iyad as he states in his Kitdb al-Sifa: Both the predecessors (al-salaf) and later scholars (al-halaf) from imams of gui dance agreed that it was permissible to quote the views of the disbelievers and atheists in their books and assemblies to make them clear to people and to refute their heresies. Although it has been reported that Ahmad b. Hanbal objected to al-Harit b. Asad al-Muhasibi doing this, Ahmad b. Hanbal himself did some thing similar when he refuted the Gahmiyya and those who said that the Qur'an was created.51 Thus, the contention that al-Muhasibi made mention of the 'innovative' sects in Islamic doctrine seems to be a baseless argument, since, as qddi Iyad has 48 See footnote 58 below. 49 Perhaps referring to the work al-Radd 'aid l-Gahmiyya wa-l-zanddiqa. See Ibn Taymiyya, Dar tddrud al-aql wa-l-naql, II, pp. 18-19. 50 Ibid.,Vll,p. 149. 51 Al-Qadi lyad al-Yahsubi, Kitdb al-Sifa bi-tdrif huquq al-mustafd, ed. Haytam al-Tu'aymi and Nagib Magidi, Beirut, al-Maktaba l-'asriyya, 2001, pp. 371-2. In addition, one should also refer to the implausible and inaccurate explanation that al-Qari provides in attempting to explain Ibn Hanbals action. See al-Mulld 'All 1-Qari, Sarh al-Sifa li-l-qddi 'lyad, Beirut, Dar al-kutub al-'ilmiyya, n.d., II, p. 455.</page><page sequence="20">356 G. Picken /Arabica 55 (2008) 337-361 pointed out, there is a consensus amongst both the early and later scholars of Islam that this is permissible?if the goal of it is to clarify their heresies and at the same time refute them. Indeed, this was the same goal to which al-Muhasibi aspired and moreover, as qddi Iyad observes, Ibn Hanbal himself appropriates the same technique when refuting similar heretical views in his work al-Radd 'aid l-Gahmiyya wa-l-zanddiqa.52 Therefore, the claim that al Muhasibi was repudiated for this reason seems unlikely, since Ibn Hanbal himself in this work and as the mihna accounts bear witness, engaged in refu tation of his opponents and their views. It is also worth mentioning here that Ibn Hanbal's contention with al Muhasibi may not just have been with his utilisation of kaldm as a method but also with some the specific views he may have held regarding the doctrine surrounding the Qur an. There is little doubt that al-Muhasibi's general view regarding the Qur an was that of Ibn Hanbal, in the sense that he held that the Qur an was the uncreated word of God. Despite this, however, during the course of the dispute concerning the nature of the Qur an other, more subtle and complex debates arose. One of these concerned the physical, human arti culation of the Qur an during recital (al-lujz); the question being of course? is this created also? Those who contended that the recital of the Qur an was in fact created were thus termed al-Lufziyya due to their belief in this specific aspect of doctrine concerning the Qur'an and this too has been suggested as a possible reason behind Ibn Hanbal's contention with al-Muhasibi, as al Dahabi states: Ibn al-Arabi said, "Al-Harit studied jurisprudence, recorded hadit and became familiar with the practices of the ascetics, such that he reached an [elevated] rank in knowledge. However, he spoke regarding [human] articulation [of the Qur an] (al-lujz) and faith (al-Imdn) and thus, it is said that Ahmad repudiated him such that he went into hiding for a while."53 The vehement opposition Ibn Hanbal demonstrated towards such views is fully understood when we examine other sources; for example Ibn al-Gawzi, relates the following, "Ahmad b, Zanguwayh said that he heard Ahmad b. Hanbal say, Al-Lufziyya are worse than the Gahmiyya.' "54 In a similar narra 52 It is worth noting that this particular work is one of the many works attributed to Ibn Hanbal and whose authorship is questionable. For a discussion of this issue see Ahmad b. ' Hanbal, al-Radd 'aid 1-Gahmiyya wa-l-zanadiqa, ed. 'Abd al-Rahman al-'Umayra, Riyadh, Dar al-liwa, 1977, pp. 72-8. 53 Al-Dahabi, Tdrih al-Isldm, XVIII, p. 209 and Siyar A 'lam al-nubala, XII, p. 112. 54 Ibn al-Gawzi, Mandqib al-Imdm Ahmad b. Hanbal, p. 205.</page><page sequence="21">G. Picken IArabica 55 (2008) 337-361 357 tion we find, "Muhammad b. Muslim said that he heard Ahmad b. Hanbal say, 'Whoever said that my articulation of the Quran is created (lufzi bi-l Qurdn mahluq) then he is a Gahmi.'"55 Moreover, his position is further clarified by the following statement, "Ishaq b. Ibrahim b. Hani' said that Ahmad b. Hanbal was asked should one pray behind someone who says that their articulation of the Quran is created, he said 'He should not be prayed behind, nor should he be sat with and no-one should pray [the funeral prayer] over him'."56 Thus, the issue is far more serious than al-Subki seems to indicate, since the issue of articulation of the Qur'an was not merely an issue that should not be raised but also, if one did so and in addition, believed in it, he was clearly considered by Ibn Hanbal to be a disbeliever (kdfir). This is indicated not only by the phrase, "... no-one should pray [the funeral prayer] over him" but also due to Ibn Hanbal's position regarding the Gahmiyya in general, to which al Lufziyya are compared in these narrations. As such, Ibn Hanbal's opinion of someone who considered their own personal articulation of the Qur an to be created is unequivocal; he considered them non-Muslims and it would suggest that, if he did indeed think that al-Muhasibi adopted this article of faith, then it would be a manifest reason for his repudiation of him. Despite this, however, it does not entirely explain the initial comment made by Ibn Hanbal, quoted at the beginning of this section, since once again?as was the case with the accusation that al-Muhasibi engaged in innovation?it stands to reason from the above quote of Ibn Hanbal himself, that he would not spend even one moment in the company of someone who was even suspected of holding such a belief. In a similar and somewhat related debate surrounding the nature of the Quran, yet another complex theological concept is proposed as the reason for Ibn Hanbal's rejection of al-Muhasibi. In an almost reversed argument, the question in hand does not concern the human being's articulation of the Qur'an but the divine pronunciation of speech, in the sense that, is this arti culation of words accompanied by sound or not? In this regard we find the following quote in al-Futuhi's Sarh al-Kawkab al-munir. Zayn al-Din Ibn Ragab [al-Hanbali] said in al-Mandqib, "And from the innova tions concerning the Qur an that Ahmad would reject is the statement that God spoke without sound (bi-gayri sawt), such that he [Ibn Hanbal] would reject this view and attribute innovation to the one who held it." It has been said that Ahmad renounced al-Harit al-Muhasibi for this reason.

Hammad told me that al-Harit passed by him one day and Abu Hafs al-Hassaf was with him, so he said to him, "O Abu Abd Allah, do you say that Allah's speech [is articulated] with sound?" So he said to Abu Hafs, "Answer him" and Abu Hafs replied, "If I say it is [articulated] with sound, then I also need to say this or that (kadd wa-kada).^ So I said to al-Harit, "What do you say?" and he replied, "Abu Hafs has already answered you." So Abu Abd Allah Ahmad b. Hanbal then said, "From this day I will warn [others] against Hark ."60 Thus, having consulted the previous two texts regarding the articulation of divine speech, one may conclude that such an issue was 'cut and dried', since al-Muhasibi appears to have adopted this particular theological stance to which Ibn Hanbal was equally opposed. However, the complexity of the issue and al-Muhasibi's view regarding it is alluded to by al-Kalabadi (d. 380/990) in his discussion of the nature of divine discourse when he states: The vast majority of them [the Sufis] agreed that God the Exalted's speech consists of neither letters (huruf) nor sound (sawi) or words (higa). Indeed, letters, sounds and words are indicators of speech yet they require specific devices and bodily parts [for articulation], which are the uvula, the mouth and the tongue and since God the Exalted has no bodily parts, nor a need for devices, His speech does not consist of words and sounds. Some the most revered [Sufis] said regarding His 57 The first generation of Sunni scholastic theologians {mutakallimu ahl al-sunnd) associated with Abd Allah b. Said b. Kullab (d. ca. 239/854) who engaged in scholastic theology so as to defend the beliefs of the orthodox' majority from the innovations of deviant sects and included in addition to al-Muhasibi, such luminaries as Abu 1-Abbas al-QalanisI.

Picken lArabica 55 (2008) 337-361 359 speech, "That whoever speaks with words then he is deficient (mdlul) and who ever speaks sequentially [i.e. one word after another] is in need (mudtarr)? Another group of them said that the speech of God does consist of words and sounds as they claimed that speech is not known any other way, despite their affirmation that it is an uncreated attribute of God the Exalted in His essence and this was the view of Harit al-Muhasibi and from the later scholars, Ibn Salim. The basis for this is the following: since it has been established that God the Exalted is pre-eternal (qadim) and that He does not resemble His creation in any way, nor do any of His attributes resemble those of created beings, then His speech will not consist of words and sounds like that of created beings.61 On examining this text, one realises the subtlety of al-Muhasibi's argument, which is typical of the kalam style; he was in fact saying that God's speech does consist of sounds but also, that since He does not resemble His creation in any way, then neither does His speech. The sounds that articulate His speech do not resemble His creation either and al-Muhasibi, in his view at least, elimina tes the possibility of anthropomorphism (al-tasbih) ,62 As we have seen, how ever, this would most likely have been rejected by Ibn Hanbal for a variety of reasons; firstly, he may have regarded the question itself to be innovation and as such, whatever one's personal conviction regarding the issue it is unaccepta ble to even discuss such a matter, as it has no precedent amongst the preceding generations. Secondly, the argument proposed above adopts a dialectical tech nique typical of the kalam style and is, therefore rejected as a method of proof.63 Thirdly, it is unlikely that he would have even entertained the argu ment in the first place, as Ibn Hanbal often appears only to have been interes ted in the answer to the question itself rather than the rationale behind it. However, as was the case with the issue of the created nature of the Quran's articulation, this does not explain Ibn Hanbal's comment at the beginning of this section, as one may safely assume that he would not have entertained al Muhasibi's discourse for one moment, if he thought that it was underpinned by an unacceptable aberration in a believer's faith such as this. 61 Muhammad b. Ishaq al-Kalabadi, al-Tdarruf li-madhab ahlal-tasawwuf, ed. Ahmad Sams al-Din, Beirut, Dar al-kutub al-cilmiyya, 1993, p. 42. 62 In fact Ibn Taymiyya comments that this opinion, i.e. that God articulated His words with sound (takallama bi-sawt), as quoted here by al-Kalabadi is in opposition to the opinion of Ibn Kullab and therefore, concludes that this was one of the opinions that he revoked later in life, which in turn constituted his "repentance" (tawbd). See Ibn Taymiyya, Dar tddrud al-aql wa l-naql, II, p. 6 and VII, pp. 148-149. 63 It should also be noted here that Ibn Hanbal actually held that there was evidence from the revelatory sources concerning this issue and there was no need to exercise one's own rational faculties in trying to explain it. See al-Futuhl, Sarh al-Kawkab al-munir, pp. 47-8.</page><page sequence="24">360 G. Picken IArabica 55 (2008) 337-361 Thus, it is clear from the discourse presented here that one of the most manifest explanations for Ibn Hanbal's abjuration of al-Muhasibi is the latter's engagement in scholastic theology ('ilm al-kaldm) to which Ahmad was completely averse. Although the specific feature of al-Muhasibi's engagement in kalam is not entirely clear, as alluded to in the above discussion, neverthe less it provides a strong basis for the suggestion that this was the primary factor in the dispute between these two eminent personalities of the scholarly com munity in 2nd/8th-3rd/9th centuries Baghdad. As such Ibn Hanbal's com ment, "I don't think that I have seen a people such as these nor anyone speak regarding the realties [of faith] (al-haqaiq) like this man, yet despite what I have said, I do not think that you should keep their company" may be unders tood in the light of al-Subki's comment mentioned above, "Know that al imdm Ahmad, may Allah be pleased with him, was highly critical of anyone who spoke regarding scholastic theology {'ilm al-kaldm) out of fear that it would lead to that which is inappropriate." Therefore, although Ibn Hanbal may well have been impressed by al-Muhasibi's discussion of spiritual matters, he was not willing to allow a student to keep his company whilst the possibi lity existed that al-Muhasibi may engage in kalam during his discourse, which as Ahmad viewed it, was an unacceptable risk and indeed, detrimental to the religion as a whole, even if it was on the premise of defending the faith. Conclusion Possible reasons for Ibn Hanbal's stance regarding our subject have been ela borated above and although the most apparent of Ahmad's objections to al Muhasibi was his utilisation of scholastic theology (cilm al-kaldm), it is likewise possible that the suggestions posited above are to a lesser or greater extent, equally feasible or indeed, one cannot rule out a combination of factors. In addition, what is also clear is that al-Muhasibi was very much a product of his time, in the sense that he engaged himself with the various fields of learning of the day and making the most of his presence in the thriving state capital. Indeed, he appears to have developed his own scholarly methodology in dealing with the deep, moral introspection of the human soul and actively engaged in the theological debates of his era, as to provide a rational defence of the Sunni position. Furthermore, it was this very approach, which in many ways seems diame trically opposed to the staunch traditionist stance, that caused him to be revi led in his own time and in subsequent generations and consequently, by the</page><page sequence="25">G. Picken lArabica 55 (2008) 337-361 361 same token he may be viewed equally as a 'victim' of his own era, falling foul of the scholars whose very view he was trying to defend. In addition, this incident also provides a fascinating insight into the battle for supremacy with regard to who has religious authority within nascent Sunni 'orthodoxy'. The 'battle' was 'won ultimately by the ascendant traditionists who seem to have not only enjoyed a degree of state support in the post-mihna period but also the backing of the public at large. This situation did not continue, however, and the trend towards a kaldm style discourse set by the likes of Ibn Kullab, al-Qalanisi and al-Muhasibi was perpetuated by the advent of Abu 1-riasan Ali 1-Asari (d. 324/935) and the subsequent school associated with him. Therefore, one of the great ironies of this very incident is that the defence of Sunni 'orthodoxy' via rational and dialectic methods as employed by scholastic theology became a normative practice in the subsequent period with the genesis, development and maturing of Sunni kaldm. Indeed, in the centuries that followed Asarism would ultimately wrestle religious authority in the field of theology from Hanbalism and despite the attempted recovery of authority by Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328) and those of his ilk, the As'arites cemented their position as the spokesmen of Sunni theology until the modern period. Moreover, this is a position which al Muhasibi had no small part in playing as al-Bagdadi (d. 429/1037-8) obser ves, "And the books of al-Harit b. Asad on scholastic theology (al-kaldm), jurisprudence (al-fiqh) and Prophetic tradition (al-hadit) were relied upon by the theologians (mutakallimuri), jurists (fuqaha) and Sufis from our com panions [i.e. the As'arites],"64 64 'Abd al-Qahir b. Tahir b. Muhammad al-Bagdadi, Kitdb Usui al-Din, Istanbul, Matba'at al-dawla, 1928, pp. 308-309.</page></plain_text>
