His answer was that whetstones can't cut, but they produce edged tools. So perhaps one who is neither poet nor philosopher need not feel too apologetic about an attempt to study in a sympathetic way a very small sector in the relations of these two important elements in ancient cultural life. In one sense, poetry, in at least some of its phases, is of the nature of philosophy, as was suggested long ago by Aristotle,3 who held that the poetry of epic and drama is "more philosophical" than history in that it is creative and under the guise of the specific is dealing with the universal. So, didactic poets in the field of ethics, e.g. satirists, criticize society on the basis of a more or less conscious philosophy of life. Horace, for instance, adheres to the old Greek doctrine /b76ev a'yav, ne quid nimis, "don't go to extremes," the core of Aristotle's system of ethics. That there is no inevitable repulsion between philosophical disquisition and poeti- cal atmosphere is evidenced by the writings of Democritus, Plato, and Lucretius. Cicero tells us4 that some held the works of Democ- ritus and Plato to be more truly poetical than the productions of the comedians. Philosophy and verse were associated from very early times. Thales, we are told,5 wrote an Astrologia in verse form; and we still have many fragments of Empedocles, Parmenides, and Xenoph- anes. Then we remember how philosophical systems or treatises that were originally propounded in prose were sometimes put into verse form by later adherents. Thus Eudoxus' ideas on astronomy 1 A paper read before the Classical Association of the Pacific States, Northern Sec- tion, Eugene, Oregon, December 29, 1941. 2 Plutarch, Mor. 838E. 3 A.P., 1451A-B. 4 Or., 67. 5 Plutarch, Mor. 402F-403A. 49</page><page sequence="2">o. J. TODD 50 have survived in the hexameters of Aratus;6 and Epicurus' views on cosmogony, psychology, and theology are represented not only by the surviving prose letters and maxims but by the powerful verses of Lucretius. We even get a third generation in the family when Aratus' versified astronomy of Eudoxus is done into Latin hexameters by Cicero, Germanicus, and Avienus. It is not with these professed philosophers, however, that I wish to deal, but rather with some of the amateurs, to present in a very slight and sketchy manner the impact of a few philosophical ideas on some of the classical poets, to see how philosophy colored certain poets' writings that were meant for other ends, and how some poets for special purposes deliberately avoided certain philosophical con- cepts that had come to be more or less truisms in their generation. Let us begin with a point in physical philosophy. To Homer7 the earth presented itself apparently as a disk of mountains, valleys, plains, rivers, islands, and landlocked seas embraced by the stream called Ocean. So Mimnermus8 pictures the sun as riding at night, asleep in a golden bed, over the sea from west to east; and Aeschylus9 thinks of the ocean as a stream sur- rounding all the land. But early in the Greek Renaissance two men, Thales and Pythagoras, we are informed,0 adopted the revolutionary concept of the earth as a ball hanging in space. This carries with it as a corollary the existence of antipodes," people directly beneath us with their feet turned up toward us and their heads, from our point of view, hanging downward. This new idea did not appeal to everyone,12 but was accepted by Aristotle,l3 6 Theon, Vita Arat., in (acc. to G. R. Mair, Loeb). Cicero tells us of the general tra- dition among scholars that Aratus was out of his proper field when he wrote on such a theme (De Orat., I, 69). 7 Cf.

Not only can one infer this interest from Vergil's echoes of Lucretius,"7 but we are told by the ancient biographers and com- mentators18 that Vergil had attended lectures on Epicureanism under the philosopher Siron, and in his last days intended, after spending three years in perfecting the Aeneid, to devote the re- mainder of his life to the study of philosophy. In a passage out- lining the farmer's calendar of agricultural operations, then, it is not very startling to see him go out of his way to speak of the two views on this subject of the earth's conformation:19 The world rises aloft toward Russia [he declares] and the Macedonian heights, and is correspondingly depressed toward the southerly winds of Africa. Up here we always have a pole exalted; the other pole, situate under our feet, the black river Styx and the deep dead behold. Here the great Serpent twines in winding coils around and between the two Bears like a river -the two Bears, which are in dread of dipping into the waters of the Ocean; there, we are told, either there is the quiet of the dead of night and darkness is ever spread thick under night's covering, or else Aurora returns from us to them and brings them back the daylight, and when the rising Sun blows first upon us with the breath of his panting steeds, there the ruddy Evening Star kindles its late beams. Vergil's indecision in this matter is in contrast to the matter-of- fact acceptance of the Stoic view by Seneca's nephew Lucan, who speaks20 of "heaven's deep night, at the hour when the Titan [the sun] brings on mid-day underneath our earth"; and in describing the hardships of the Pompeian troops in the deserts of Africa21 has 14 Cleomedes, De Motu Circ., i, 10.

TODD a grousing Roman infantryman remark: "We are marching to the opposite pole; we are being pushed off the earth; we are letting the South Wind blow upon our backs; perhaps right now Rome itself is under my feet." Another literary man, the earthy fourth-century poet Tiberianus, went a step further and represented the antipodes, i.e., the people directly down under on the opposite side of the earth, as sending a letter to the people in Italy in language that might be para- phrased: "Dear People Down Under, . . . Yours truly, The People on Top."22 Lucan, brought up, no doubt, in close familiarity with his uncle's teaching,23 found it easy and natural to adopt the Stoic physical doctrine. Vergil appears much less confident; he had obviously read not only in Epicurean theory but also in other philosophies, and, although manifesting a keen interest in these matters and a poet's feeling for the poetry of great concepts, is not ready to align himself with a particular school.24 We might note two matters in which this eclecticism is made clear. The Epicureans accepted the old doctrine of Leucippus and Democritus that all physical objects, no matter how solid they may appear, actually consist of infinitesimal particles which they called atoms and which the modern physicist would term mole- cules; but they went one step further and postulated that the human soul is physical and similarly constituted. They then drew the inevitable conclusion that death is simply a disintegration of these molecules, and consequently there is no such thing as spiritual immortality. For the purposes of his Aeneid Vergil dis- cards this Epicurean materialism and draws on two sources. First, he goes back to Homer's Odyssey for the grand fancy of a human being going to the world below and conversing with the dead, and then to the Platonic theory of the soul's purification there, so that he may picture Aeneas as seeing unrolled a great canvas of the future heroes of the Roman state. On the question of fate we are familiar with the antagonism 22 Servius on Aen., vI, 532: Tiberianus etiam inducit epistolam vento allatam ab Antipodibus quae habet, "Superi inferis salutem." 23 Echoes of Stoicism in I, 72-80; ii, 7, 302, 383; IV, 643; vw, 812-815; VIII, 580; Ix, 566-571; etc. 24 Some of the ancients were disturbed at Vergil's tergiversation; cf. the Schol. Daniel. on Georg., iv, 219: et quidam accusant quod cum sit Epicureus alienam sectam usurpare videtur.</page><page sequence="5">POETS AND PHILOSOPHERS between Stoics and Epicureans. The former held that events are merely links in a complete concatenation of cause and effect; or, if they felt ill at ease with such a scheme of utter foreordination, they modified this with the notion of contingent fate; e.g., it is not necessarily fated that you get into trouble with the police, but it may be your doom to do so if you break the traffic regulations; but whether it is a matter of destiny that you shall do this too I am afraid they shirked trying to determine. On this matter of abso- lute fatalism Epicurus is reported25 to have said, much as I remember Josiah Royce saying: "The man who asserts that every- thing occurs in accordance with necessity cannot censure one who denies this; for his position is that this very denial occurs in accordance with necessity." Whether Vergil was concerned with the logical difficulty involved there is no evidence to show; but his handling of fatum when he says, e.g., that Aeneas came to Italy fato profugus, does not appear any more advanced than that of Hoirer or Aeschy]us, who hold that there is something inscrutable acting as a barrier to complete freedom of action on the part of gods and men. Zeus may grieve over Sarpedon's death, but it is a doom which he cannot forefend.26 Again, Zeus is subject to a par- ticular doom if he unites with Thetis; but whether or not he does so unite is a matter of his own free choice. One would hardly expect a poet of any dramatic sense to subscribe to the view that every act and word of all his characters is a predetermined thing. He prefers to draw his hero as pitting his own powers against a mysterious and greater force. Even Lucan, who is familiar with the Stoic position in this matter,27 comes to a more popular con- cept when he speaks of the "die of fate."28 Another Stoic tenet at which we might glance for a moment is the repeated assertion that virtue is its own reward.29 Two of the later poets, Silius Italicus and Claudian, accept this view of life and state it dogmatically: Ipsa quidem virtus sibimet pulcherrima merces,30 and again: Ipsa quidem virtus pretium sibi.3 Servius 25 Gnomolog.

TODD claims that Vergil's phrase mens sibi conscia recti32 is an echo of the Stoics, although I suspect that if he had borne in mind more clearly the whole sentence in Vergil he might have taken just the opposite view. However that may be, Ovid, in the bitterness of exile over in eastern Rumania, is convinced that this principle simply does not hold in real life. "Among thousands and thou- sands you cannot readily discover a single man who looks on virtue as its own reward. If rewards for right conduct be wanting, honesty in and of itself does not stir a person; he has only regret over being an honest man for nothing."33 Even during his palmy days in Rome, Ovid was no idealist; and it is not surprising to find him a bit cynical after his great calamity. From these matters of physical philosophy and ethics let us pass to a topic in anthropology and sociology that comes up again and again among ancient poets both Greek and Roman-what primitive man was like and under what social environment he lived. In the very earliest times we find a Greek poet who was inclined now and then to exalt the men of earlier days. Old Nestor tells the assembled Greek captains34 that as a young man he had associated on terms of equality with better men than those of the present generation. And the strong men of that generation, Diomede,35 Ajax,36 Aeneas,37 Hector,38 were mightier men of their hands than those of the poet's own day. "Hector seized a big stone," we read, "which two of the best men of the present time, as men go now-a- days, could hardly lever off the ground onto a wagon; he bran- dished it by himself with ease." But of course Homer was inter- ested chiefly not in depreciating his own contemporaries but rather in exalting the heroes of the stirring times then gone, as is clear when he represents Achilles39 as able to open and close a heavy door which required the efforts of three normal men of his own day. 32 Aen., I, 603-605: Di tibi, si qua pios respectant numina, si quid / usquam iustitia est et mens sibi conscia recti, / praemia digna ferant. A somewhat clearer instance would be the expression in ix, 253 f., where Aletes, in speaking of possible rewards for Nisus and Euryalus, says: pulcherrima primum di moresque dabunt vestri. 33 Pont., Ir, 3, 11-15: Nec facile invenias multis in milibus unum virtutem pretium qui putet esse sui. Ipse decor, recte facti se praemia desint, non movet, et gratis paenitet esse probum. 34 II., I, 260-272. 3 II., v, 302-304. 36 II., XIi, 378-385. 37 II., xx, 285-287. 38 II., II, 445-449. 39 1I., XXIV, 453-456. 54</page><page sequence="7">POETS AND PHILOSOPHERS Whether it was under the influence of these scattered remarks in the Homeric epic, or because of his own bitter experiences, or a combination of both, Hesiod gives a fairly detailed account of almost steady deterioration in the development of mankind through what has all the ear-marks of experimental creation by the powers of Heaven:40 First, in the days of Cronus, came a golden race, who lived like gods, without toil, worry, sorrow, or wrong-doing; for whom the earth produced a livelihood spontaneously. For some unexplained reason the heavenly powers removed this race and changed them into beneficent spirits on the earth. Next, there was created an inferior race, of silver, who took a century to be- come adults, then lived but a short span in folly and resultant troubles, ir- religious and guilty of wrong-doing one toward another. Zeus put them away in anger, and made them an inferior sort of spirits under the earth. Then Zeus created a different race, of bronze, with bronze tools and weapons, a terrible and mighty generation, who required no food, and whose chief interest was warfare. They perished at one another's hands and so went to the realm of the dead. Zeus tried again, and produced the great race of men with divine blood in their veins, those who fought at Troy and Thebes. These present a relief in the sombre account of human degeneration; they were more just than their immediate predecessors, but still they went down in battle, and now live far away in the islands of the blessed, in honor and freedom from anxiety. Last comes the wicked age of iron, Hesiod's own time, to which he regrets that he belongs. Labor and sorrow, unreliability, disrespect for the honorable, and destruction are their lot. But Zeus will punish them; "Reverence" and "Righteous Indignation" shall wrap themselves up in their white mantles and depart for heaven, leaving men to ills irremediable. The only serious Greek writers, so far as I am aware, who ac- ceded to this view of retrogression in the human race were, first, the philosopher Empedocles, who has a few lines that seem to refer to the fabulous golden age,41 and is quoted42 as asserting that the moderns are but as babes compared to the men living at the dawn of history; and, second, Aratus, who is reputed to have gone out of his own proper field to put into verse part, at least, of the astronomical system of Eudoxus, and in speaking of the constella- tion Virgo,43 has her in her aspect of "Justice" live among men in 40 W.D., 109-201. 41 KapOapwli, 425-436 (ed.

J. TODD the golden age, then do battle against the vices of the next two periods, and finally, in despair, like Hesiod's AiSbs and NEucwas, abandon this earth for a resting place in heaven. But in general the prevailing idea among thoughtful Greeks and Romans is that which is adumbrated in one of the Homeric Hymns,44 where the smith god and Athena, the goddess of handi- crafts, are eulogized as being responsible for teaching grand accom- plishments to humans, who in earlier times had lived, like wild animals, in mountain caves, a "dumb and ignominious herd," as Horace describes them.45 This is modified by Xenophanes46 to the notion that men were not given a complete revelation at once, but have kept seeking and discovering improvements as time has gone on. Perhaps the most striking presentation of this theme among the Greeks is that of Aeschylus,47 who, for dramatic pur- poses, reverts to the idea of a beneficent giver, Prometheus. Similar credit is given to Palamedes48 or an unnamed deity49 by Sophocles and Euripides. But usually the view of Xenophanes is the one reflected in a long series of authors-Critias, Moschion, and another unidentified author of tragedy,50 the historian Thucyd- ides,51 Hippocrates the physician,52 in philosophy Plato,53 prob- ably Aristotle,54 Dicaearchus,55 and Epictetus,56 as well as the unknown author of a lesser epic,57 and an anonymous epigramma- tist;58 and among the Romans, writers in various fields-Varro,59 Cicero in over half a dozen places,f0 Lucretius in his famous fifth book,6' Horace,62 Manilius,63 Vitruvius,64 Sulpicia,65 and Quintil- ian.66 That there is scope for the serious poet in such an idea is clear enough from the well-known passages in Aeschylus and Lucretius, to go no further; and that the topic could be turned to account 44 H.H., xx (to Hephaestus). 46 Serm., I, 3, 100: mutum et turpe pecus. 46 Frg. 16 (Diehl). 47 P.V., 442-506. 48 Sophocles, Naupl. frg. 399 (Nauck2); Pal. frg. 438; Euripides, Pal. frg. 578; cf. also frg. adesp. 470. 49 Euripides, Suppl. 201-215. 60 Critias, Sisyph. 1; Moschion, frg. 6;frg. adesp. 115. 51 I, 1-19. 52 Ilepl 'Apxatl-s 'I7rptLKS 3, 7. 53 Protag. 320c-322D; Leg. 676A-682D; Tim. 21E-25D; Critias, passim. 64 Cf.

Someone, who was no fool, began by sacrificing an animal and roasting it. This meat proving more acceptable than human flesh, others followed suit. Cookery de- veloped as an art, embracing the use of salt, honey, vegetables, fish, the polypus, sausages, porridge, and so on. Once cannibalism gave way, communal and city life developed. Even today, the speaker ends, cooks have a prominent part in handling the busi- ness of sacrifice and libation. But the glamour of a prehistoric golden age, a sort of garden of Eden, had a hold on the imagination of the ancient Greek common people,68 and proved more congenial material than the other for the comic playwrights. Athenaeus69 quotes over half a dozen passages from them on the grand life of olden days.70 One71 pic- tures it as a time when peace reigned, and there was no fear or illness; everything was produced spontaneously; every ditch ran wine, bannocks fought with loaves of bread in front of people's mouths, begging to be swallowed; fish would roast and serve themselves, a stream of broth flowed past the diners' couches trundling along hot meats, etc. Men in those days were fat and regular giants. In two instances,72 where the future tense is used, the dramatists apparently represented a vision of the return of the good old days, when, as one of them73 expresses it, there will be no need of man- servant or maidservant, but one's gear will act like robots. One will merely need to say, "Table, place yourself; look here now! set yourself; knead (the dough), you little potkin; pour (the drink), beaker. Where's the cup? Go and rinse yourself.

"But I'm not yet baked on the other side." "Well, then, turn over and grease yourself and sprinkle yourself with salt." This picture of a wonderful age in the long-dead past not only gripped the imagination of the common Greek and provided con- genial themes for the Greek comic stage, but it practically monop- olized the field among the best Latin poets. Catullus utilizes the topic;74 Vergil handles it more than once;75 Tibullus alludes to it in five elegies;76 Ovid not only utilizes it in several passages,77 but in one of them78 goes in his own way through the entire Hesiodic narrative, with the significant omission of the Mycenaean age, thus showing an uninterrupted decline. Definite echoes are found also in an anonymous writer of bucolics in Nero's period,79 an anonymous Consolatio ad Liviam,80 an Elegia ad Maecenatem,81 in the Aetna,82 in Statius,83 in Silius Italicus,84 Juvenal,85 and a dozen passages in Claudian.86 It would be interesting, but too long an excursus for our purpose, to look at all the variants on the ancient theme, the morals drawn for the benefit of debased contemporaries, the appeal to the beloved to live naturally as in the old days, when there were no bars on the doors or guards at the house, the pensive drawing of the contrast in the fact that there was no warfare in those days, whereas now a man is dragged off into military service, the rather envious reference87 to a time when there was no private property, but only kindly communism, the sheer delight in pictur- ing an epoch when the world was free from all the toil, troubles, and vices of modern life.

Plato88 developed the idea, reworked later by the Stoics, of cycles in the history of the world, ending in wide devastation and destruction of animal life; so to him the age of Cronus belonged to a preceding turn of the wheel. Another method of producing some kind of harmony is found in Vergil,89 Juvenal,90 and Claudian,91 who recognize the greater purity of the golden age, but maintain that there was room for develop- ment, and that actually the later imposition of toil and poverty on man stimulated him to advance the arts. Second is the new and hopeful thought introduced by Vergil in his "Messianic Eclogue," where, possibly inspired by the facetious fancy of certain Greek comedians already noticed,92 he predicts the return of the golden age in his own day; old sin shall be done away, and fear removed; the serpent and the poisonous plant shall be extirpated.93 Here was an inspiring idea that caught the imagination and found response not only in ancient poetry but in that of the modern hymn,94 a lineal descendant of Hesiod through Vergil. An unknown writer of Nero's reign goes a step further than Vergil and asserts that the golden age has returned, and Apollo, as envisioned by Vergil,95 is enthroned.96 This same view is found in Calpurnius.97 About A.D. 400 Claudian, although in one poem98 88 Polit., 270B-274D. 89 Georg., I, 129-146. 90 xv, 147-158. 91 Manl.

J. TODD representing Pluto as comforting Proserpina by the statement that the golden race was now down with him, claims elsewhere9 that Honorius is bringing the golden age back to the earth. Then there is the cynical reaction to these rosy dreams in the generation after Vergil, by the "realist" Ovid, who writes:100 "We really have the age of gold in our day: gold has reached the pinnacle of distinction; it is gold that wins love; you yourself, O Homer, might come with the Muses in your retinue, but if you bring nothing in your hand, Homer, out you go." Finally, let us glance at a mere summary of the way in which philosophical inquiry affected the poet's notion of deity, and in particular its relation to his ideas on immortality. In the beginning one is struck by the intimate part taken by the gods in the Homeric epic; they and humans are mingled in- extricably, as warp and woof of the fabric; and, as was pointed out long ago,?10 the men are very godlike and the gods are very human. With the age of philosophic awakening the old naivete was disturbed; thunderbolts and other celestial phenomena were no longer accepted by all as personal doings of anthropomorphic gods,102 and reactions took several different forms. There is the frank dismay of Pindar at the tradition of a gluttonous deity 103 There is the profound and sympathetic reworking of the old tales by Aeschylus toward a more idealistic conception.l04 There is the reluctant and painful decision of Plato to bar Homer from his ideal commonwealth. There is the open disbelief of Diagoras. There is the half-rejection by Euripides, afraid'05 to go the whole length of throwing over the old tales and compose tragedy on saecula maternis causam qui vicit Iulis. Cf. 63-65; iv, 6 f. 98 Rapt.

He has benefitted mankind. 757-759 (Cho., after the slaying of Lycus): Who has been foolish enough to say that the gods are powerless? 772 f. (Cho., ibid.): The gods do reck of injustice and impiety! 798-814 (Cho., just before the appearance of Iris and Lyssa and the murder of the children): We do believe in the double bed of the two consorts; now we shall see whether the gods still care for justice! 830-832 (Iris): Hera intends to stain Hercules with the blood of his own children, and I am with her. 835-858 (Iris): On, Lyssa, let the wind into your sail; let him send his children to the world below and so learn the meaning of Hera's anger; else the gods are nowhere and humans will be exalted if he be not punished. (Lyssa): But Hercules did good service to men, and raised the honors of the gods that were sinking at the hands of the impious. (Iris): Don't lecture me and Hera; she did not send you here to show discretion. (Lyssa): I pro- test that this goes against the grain. 1086 f.

But I regard you, Amphitryon, and not Zeus, as my father. Zeus's mate tried to kill me when I was a babe; and after I grew up, what dangers and toils have I not undergone? This slaughter of my children is but the coping stone. 1303-1312 (Herc.): Let Hera dance with joy; she has had her will. Who would offer prayer to such a goddess? (Theseus): Yes, this is all the doing of the wife of Zeus. 1341-1346 (Herc.): I do not believe that the gods indulge in illicit unions, or bind one another, or are masters one of another.

TODD ordinary Athenians were especially prone to mysticism,108 by displaying epiphany after epiphany.109 There is the insistence by Pythagoras"? and the Stoics"l on the existence of a divine power pervading the whole universe, even man's soul, and the equally strenuous insistence of the Epicureans1l2 that, although the gods exist, they live apart from our world and have nothing to do with our lives. There is the superficial, insouciant, irresponsible atti- tude of Propertius,l3 who will cure him of his love by a trip to Athens and the study of philosophy; what sect he follows is all one to him; it may be Plato's, it may be Epicurus'-as who should say, I will forget my love affair by entering politics, it may be as a staunch Tory, it may be as a Communist, but at any rate it will be something. With this shaking up of the old beliefs came a fairly widespread attempt at rationalization of the old tales. There were numerous people resembling the modern "debunkers," who seem at times to approach their task with an already developed skepticism, and by a combination of prejudice, guessing, and insufficient evidence reach a satisfactory and foregone conclusion. The Messenian EuhemerusIl4 published the view that the deities had really been human beings of unusual abilities, and only later were regarded as superhuman. An ancient commentator on 108 As in the years after 1914 palmists and clairvoyants flourished as never before, so in the troublous times surrounding the Peloponnesian war the Athenian masses gave ready ear to a flood of oracles.

In the Hipp. and the Ion there are two each; in the Troad. the epiphany is a double one (not to mention Thanatos in the Alc. and Lyssa in the H.F.). In three of the other five plays there are miracles: the ghost in the Hec., the translation of Iphigenia in the I.A., and the arrival of the Sun's chariot in the Med. Only the Heraclidae and the Phoenissae are free from the supernatural. 110 Cicero, N.D., I, 27: Pythagoras, qui censuit animum esse per naturam rerum omnem intentum et commeantem, ex quo nostri animi carperentur....

When water, earth, and air combine to subdue unmitigated heat, nature calls the sun to come back and restore it. Servius"6 avers that the Chimaera, "a lion in front, a snake in the rear, a she-goat in the middle,"117 in reality was a volcanic mountain in Cilicia infested with lions near the peak and snakes at the base, but offer- ing good pasturage half-way up that fed a great many goats; Bellerophon made the place habitable, and thus "slew the Chi- maera." A poet of Hadrian's time1l8 claimed that the Gorgons, whose look turned one to stone, were merely young ladies of such unusual beauty that young men, when they looked at them, stood rooted to the ground in a daze. Lucan9ll describes a tornado in the African desert which raises a sand-storm, sweeps off the surface of the desert, and whisks away the troops' helmets, shields, and javelins. Herein, he says, lies the explanation of the old story about the dropping of the ancilia from heaven in the days of Numa. Phaedrusl20 regards the old tales of Sisyphus, Tantalus, the Danaides, and Tityos as imaginative sermons on ethics, deal- ing respectively with the unhappiness of men's life, the discomfort of avarice, the fleeting and unsatisfactory nature of high living, the worry attending the plutocrat. These few samples of the varying interpretations offered by the "debunkers" not only show the highly conjectural basis of their work but are illuminating as to the extent of the dissatisfaction felt in regard to the old myths. The general weakening of belief is reflected in Vergil's handling of the gods. Although at times he appears to accept the Stoic pantheism,l21 he generally reproduces the anthropomorphic deities of Homer, and brings them in as 116 On Aen., vr, 288. Strabo (xiv, 3, 5), after noting two mountains in Lycia called AvTLKpayos and Kpaoyos, says that the story of the Chimaera was localized here, and that not far off is a ravine named Xacupa running up from the coast. Quintus Smyrnaeus (vIII, 107) speaks of Chimaera's crag (Kpr1uvOv re XLtjaiprs). 117 Homer, I., vI, 181. 118 Septimius Serenus in Serv. on Aen., vi, 289: Serenus tamen dicit poeta Gorgones puellas fuisse unius [unicae, Baehrens] pulchritudinis, quas cum vidissent adulescentes stupore torpebant, unde fingitur quod si quis eos vidisset vertebatur in lapidem. 119 B.C., Ix, 458-480. 120 App., v. 121 Georg., iv, 219-227; Aen., vi, 724-734. 63</page><page sequence="16">0. J. TODD actors in his plot. But they never seem thoroughly convincing, and I think that Vergil is most himself when in speaking of Triton's drowning of Misenus, he adds (what would be impossible to Homer) the precautionary si credere dignum est.122 This topic is much too large for extended treatment here; but I should like to present briefly one small phase of it, the repercus- sions on the Romans' belief in immortality. There was a marked, and not isolated, tendency on the part of cultivated Romans first of all to disown the awesome pictures drawn by Homer in the Odyssey and by many later authors of the gruesome and harrowing punishments meted out in the lower world. The Epicureans shelved all that by their theory of the physical constitution of the human soul; being composed of mole- cules, it is merely disintegrated at death, and so there is an end of the individual. Lucretius is the great Roman exponent of this view. Catullus123 obviously is of the same conviction and rejects the notion of a future life of any kind. Juvenall24 tells us that in his day even youngsters, except perhaps tiny tots, have no belief in spirits of the dead, the subterranean realm, the boatman's punt- pole, the black frogs of the Stygian flood, the ferrying of all those thousands in one dinghy. But others in the classical period had come to an equal distrust in the stories of post-mortem pun- ishments without discarding their belief in the hereafter. As early 122 Aen., vi, 173. So Georg., III, 391. Cf. also the parenthetic mirabile dictu or the like in Georg., III, 275. Aen., I, 439; II, 174, 680; vIII, 252; ix, 120. 123 V, 4-6: soles occidere et redire possunt; nobis cum semel occidit brevis lux, nox est perpetua una dormienda. Cf. also Catullus, ci, 10: in perpetuum, frater, ave atque vale. 124 EI, 149-152: Esse aliquos manes et subterranea regna et contum et Stygio ranas in gurgite nigras atque una transire vadum tot milia cumba nec pueri credunt, nisi qui nondum aere lavantur. Plutarch, writing in about the same period as Juvenal, and familiar to some extent with Roman life and thought, may have had Romans as well as Greeks in mind when he di- vides people into three classes (Mor. 11Olc f., 1104A-c, 1105A f.): first, a minority com- prising evil-doers, for whom the fear of punishment in Hades is a salutary check on crime; second, the great majority of common men, who are not vicious and have no apprehension about the future, for most of whom the stories of Cerberus, etc., are simply mothers' and nurses' tales; and third, a second minority of serious-minded, up- right, and religious men, who look upon the deity as the father of all good and upon the future life as one of beauty and godliness, a compensation for this present life's hard- ships and disappointments and a reward for merit, as well as an opportunity for the punishment of outstanding sinners. 64</page><page sequence="17">POETS AND PHILOSOPHERS as 66 B.C. Cicero, in a murder trial, has no hesitation in saying'25 that the stories of punishment are just silly and not believed in by anyone; and in his Tusculans'26 looks upon them as so far out of date as not to be worth troubling to refute. Senecal27 also pooh- poohs all the pother and fuss made by the Epicureans over the question.128 Now, while Cicero cannot grant the stories of punish- ments, he argues eloquently in the sixth book of the De Republica, the first book of the Tusculans, and the latter part of the De Senec- tute for a life hereafter; and yet sometimes I think that it is as much an effort to convince himself as to convince his readers, and that he is somewhat in the same case as one of the interlocu- tors in the Tusculans, who, when urged to read attentively Plato's Phaedo, replies:'29 "I have done so, frequently; but somehow or other, I agree so long as I am reading; once I lay the book down, however, and begin to turn the question of the soul's immortality over in my own mind, all that agreement slips away." Is it fanciful to connect this apparent weakening of a faith in personal continuance of the individual in the next world with the persistent claims of the Roman poets for a literary immortality? There had been little of this self-conscious attitude among Greek authors. When Thucydides calls his book "an eternal posses- sion,'130 he is thoroughly objective; it is not a prediction that the author will be remembered but rather that his work will be of value to students of historical science. It is true that Homer sug- gests that poetry lives on, when he makes Helen complain131 of the cruel doom visited upon her and Paris, so that they shall be- come the theme of song even for people of future generations. But 125 Clu. 171. This is particularly cogent evidence as to the ordinary Roman's view, be- cause, as a practical lawyer, Cicero would not risk his client's fate by a statement that would offend the majority of the jury. 126 I, 10 f., 48.

Theognis'32 assures his friend Cyrnus that he has given him wings of song, so that he shall fly over all the earth and the sea and be present at feasts and in courts on everyone's lips, and even after death shall not lose his renown so long as sun and earth endure. But this posthumous fame is for the subject, not the author. Sappho perhaps comes closer, in a negative way, and by mere implication, when she says of a con- temporary133 that she will never be remembered because she has no part in the roses of Pieria. Possibly one is justified in inferring that Sappho is thinking that she herself will be so remembered. Pindar realizes vividly the endurance of poetry,134 and even suggests that it is immortal;'35 but, again, one notes that the poet is conferring, not winning, immortality, and doing even this in a rather im- personal way.'36 In later times Epicurus writes to his friend Idomeneus :137 "If you are attracted by renown, my letters will make you better known than will all these things which you cherish and for which you are cherished."

It is something less gen- eral than the lines of Horace: Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona multi, sed omnes inlacrimabiles urgentur ignotique longa nocte, carent quia vate sacro;138 or the statement of Quintilian139 about the posthumous fame that attends the literary man, or the aphorism of Ovid140 that literature stands the years, or Claudian's recommendation of a young con- temporary's books that were born to last through the centuries,l4 or even the claims of the anonymous poet in the Anthologia La- tina142 that while the great monuments along the Appian Way, the pyramids, and the mauseoleum built for Cleopatra's husband will be shaken and laid low by time, poetry is liberated from doom and repulses death; Homer will always live in his poetry. It is rather like the expressed hope of the architect Vitruvius that his publica- tions will make him known to posterity,143 or again,144 his assertion that, although the lives and ways of life of literary men are not signalized by the honors bestowed on great athletes, yet their minds, set on lofty things, mount to heaven and will ensure a remembrance in later times not only of their ideas but even of their appearance. So all people of any literary sensibility, he con- tinues, will always keep in their hearts a sort of hallowed likeness of the poet Ennius; Accius will seem to be present not only in his poetry but in his person; Lucretius will appear to argue with us tete-a-tete on the physical universe; so one will discuss the art of public speaking with Cicero, the Latin tongue with Varro.145 138 Carm., iv, 9, 25-28.

TODD Sometimes it is a general hope or confidence that one's poetry will continue to live in succeeding ages. Thus Catullus voices the modest prayer'46 that the Muse will permit his little volume to last on through the years for more than one age. Horacel47 is sure that his will do so. Statius148 also hopes for repute even when he is in the tomb. Again, the poet sometimes focuses his wish or his expectation on some particular person or event which his commemoration will render immortal. Cicero, the prince of Latin prose authors, who made excursions also into the realm of verse and had a naive con- fidence in his worth as a poet,149 begins his De Legibus with this bit of conversation imagined as taking place between Quintus and Atticus down at the old home in Arpinum: Att. Yes, there is the grove; I recognize the oak tree of the Arpinates that I have read about so often in the poem Marius. If that oak still stands, thisis surely it; it's old enough. Quint. It will stand all right, my dear Atticus, and always will; for it was planted by literary ability. No stock can be planted by a farmer that will last as long as what is planted by a poet's verse. ... So long as Latin literature speaks, there will never be wanting on this spot an oak called Marius' oak... So Vergil150 promises that if his poems have any power, the names of Nisus and Euryalus will never pass away so long as Aeneas' home abides on the immovable Capitoline rock and the Roman sire holds sway. Horace151 assures the Bandusian spring of its immortality; Gratius152 predicts the enduring fame of a dog breeder and trainer; Ovid'53 prophesies that Corinna's name and productions ensure his freedom from mortality, so long as the vigor of Latin and the charm of Greek endure. Martial, in a prefatory epigram prefixed to Book ix, speaks of L. Stertinius Avitus as a famous bard "cui refert serus praemia digna cinis." 146 I, 8-10. 147 Carm., II, 30; iv, 9, 1-4. 148 Silv., v, 3, 211-214. 149 A reading of the fragments of the De Consulatu Suo will dispel any erroneous no- tion that one might have on Cicero's poetical inspiration. It is noteworthy, further, that, save for the translation of Aratus' Phaenomena, over 90 per cent of Cicero's verses are extant today for the sole reason that Cicero quotes them in his other works. Ancient critics, except for Plutarch (Cic., ii, near end), who admits (Dem., ii) that he studied Latin only in his old age, when it was hard for him, are unanimous in their adverse criticism. Cf. Seneca Rhetor, Controv., III, praef. 8 (quoting Cassius Severus); Martial, II, 89, 1-4; Quintilian, Inst. Orat., ix, 4, 41; Juvenal, x, 122-124; Tacitus, Dial. 21. And even Plutarch admits (Cic., loc. cit.) that while Cicero's fame in oratory still remained high in the first century A.D., his poetry was in utter disrepute. 160 Aen., ix, 446-448. 151 Carm., III, 13, 15-18. 152 Cyneg., 251 f. 153 Am., I, 3, 25 f. 68</page><page sequence="21">POETS AND PHILOSOPHERS his will be linked forever; again,154 that when the poet dies, as in the case of Homer, it is only his poetry that escapes the flames of the funeral pyre, and therefore Delia and Nemesis, the two lady-loves of Tibullus, are assured of a long-enduring name; again,155 of an enemy, that he will be notorious not only in his own generation but forever; or"56 that his friends will be praised and their fame abide in later times because of his verses. Lucanl57 says that if his poetry avails, when people are reading in alternate fear and hope about wars, they will read of Pompey and be kindly disposed toward him. Silius Italicus158 says that people in later times will pray to have brothers like those whom he depicts, if only his poems can survive. Statius159 writes: "Let the flames absorb the heir's inheritance and the ashes be packed on the lofty pyre, to waft up clouds of devoted incense to the clear sky; I shall bring gifts that will not burn, and your pain, under my pointing hand, shall endure for the years to come." But frequently the Roman poets go beyond promising long life to their works or to persons or things which they have made fa- mous, and visualize a sort of vicarious personal immortality, as the anonymous writer on Maecenas promised for Homer.160 In fact, Ennius1'l proudly claims to have achieved this: "Let no one give me the adornment of tears or conduct my funeral with weeping. Why? Because I fly, living, over the lips of men." "I shall not perish entire," writes Horace;l62 "a great portion of me shall escape the goddess of burial." Ovid is particularly insistent on this. "When the last flame has eaten into me," he says in one place,163 "I shall live on, and the greater part of me will survive." In another,'64 I have now completed a work that neither Jove's wrath nor fire nor sword nor hungry eld shall ever be able to annihilate. Let that day which has juris- diction only over this body of mine come when it will and bring to an end the span of my uncertain life; yet with my better part I shall fly through the years unending above the stars, and my name can never be erased.

TODD 70 the Roman power conquers the earth and spreads, I shall be read by the na- tion's lips, and if bards' prophecies have any truth in them, I shall live by my repute throughout the ages. This sort of claim becomes especially frequent after Ovid has gone into exile,165 where he reverts to the theme half a dozen times. Lucan,l66 Stoic-trained though he appears to have been, goes so far as to assert that the hallowed labors of poets rob fate and grant mortals immortality. So, in apostrophe, he exhorts Julius Caesar, the villain of his epic, who had just been treading unawares near the scattered stones of Hector's memorial, not to be worried lest repute be grudged to him; the epic will live on and never be con- demned to darkness, and people in time to come will read of both Caesar and Lucan. Martial, oddly enough, is a bit more diffident than most, and says'67 that if names are entered on his pages that are destined to live, and if he has the right to survive his own obsequies, then both the present and the future masses will hear what he has to say. This almost pathetic insistence on a literary immortality must be due partly to the Romans' awareness of how the great works of their predecessors, the Greeks, had lived on long after their authors were laid in their graves. There may be also a manifestation here of what the psychologists term an "inferiority complex," and the working of a "defense mechanism." But I am reminded also of a statement made by a colleague years ago to the effect that, al- though he was not sure of his own personal continuance in an after life, he counted on a vicarious immortality in the life of his son. And so it appears a fairly reasonable suggestion that when the Roman literary men lost a vivid sense of individual permanence the urge for something of the kind induced them to replace this with the hope of immortality in their works. In this rather cursory review we might point out an ancient philosophical lack. Although there were authors such as Martial 165 Trist., III, 3, 77-80; 7, 49-54; iv, 10, 129 f. Cf. Trist., iv, 9, 25 f.; Pont., III, 2, 29-36; iv, 8, 51, cited in nn. 140, 155, 156. 166 B.C., Ix, 980-986. 167 vII, 44, 7-9. Note also x, 2, 7 f., where Rome is pictured as telling Martial of the benefit he will derive from his reader: Pigra per hunc fugies ingratae flumina Lethes et meliore tui parte superstes erit. Pliny (Ep., IIi, 21, 6) suggests that although Martial's literary immortality may be open to question, it was at any rate the poet's objective.</page><page sequence="23">POETS AND PHILOSOPHERS and Petronius who indulged now and then in plain dirt, there was no Freud, no school of neurotics, no cult of the mere bizarre, in- coherent, ugly, or unclean; no Joe Vance, who made a point of calling a spade a spade and would talk of nothing else. There was plenty of plain speaking among the ancients, not only in Aris- tophanes but among the philosophers and elsewhere. They could take strong meat in its place; but on the whole they appear to have differentiated between meat which is strong and that which is merely high. O. J. TODD University of British Columbia Ed.

"A multitude of books," he warns, "distracts the mind." One wonders what Seneca would have said about survey courses: "He who is everywhere is nowhere"?)
