Graphite Painted Pottery by Elizabeth Gardner Pottery settlement Europe. is one As and farming of civilization the key developed indicators in prehistoric and of settlement and civilization in prehistoric Europe. As farming developed and more permanent villages were established, ancient peoples fashioned clay vessels, at times decorating them with painted designs or incisions. One type of ware found throughout Bulgaria, Romania and northern Greece was covered with a special silvery graphite - either entirely or with geometric or spiral painted designs. Only when excavated sherds were subjected to a series of technological tests, however, was the significance of this ancient ware revealed. A great number of graphite painted vessels have been found at Sitagroi, a prehistoric site located on the Plain of Drama in northern Greece. The Sitagroi tell, measuring some 200 meters in length and six meters in height, is one of about 18 tells found in the area. Its cultural connections, however, are more far-flung and of the 500 or more related sites found throughout Europe, it is one of the few that has been systematically excavated. The project, under the direction of Marija Gimbutas of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Colin Renfrew of the University of Southampton, England, was considered a highly important undertaking. It was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the University of Sheffield and the British School of Archaeology at Athens and was authorized by the Greek Archaeological Service. The purpose of excavations during 1968-1969 was to study the origin of the Greek Neolithic period and to investigate the migration of people between Anatolia and Europe between 6000 and 3000 b.c. The research also focused on defining the earliest beginnings of European metallurgy and the inception of the North Aegean Early Bronze Age in this key area, a crossroad between the Balkans, the Aegean and Anatolia. Greek Macedonia and Thrace form a corridor connecting Europe with the East; it is bordered on the north by the Rhodope Mountains of Bulgaria and on the south by the Aegean Sea. Routes inland run along the river valleys, particularly the Vardar River, a major highway north into the western Balkans. Excavations in this corridor have revealed a spread during the early Greek 18 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="2">Sherds from Sitagroi with a graphite wash.

Neolithic period of the so-called Sesklo Culture north along the Vardar. Central and eastern Macedonia and Thrace maintained close affinities to the north from the Middle Neolithic period onward. The earliest Neolithic period is little known in this area and tell settlements generally do not show such a long development as the larger Thessalian mounds. Some elements relating to the cultures of Bronze Age Troy are found in the Drama Plain settlements, including pierced tunnel lugs set at the rims of vessels, protruding crescentic lug handles and strap handled mugs. But these features date earlier than Troy, indicating a flow of people and ideas toward Anatolia as well as toward Greece. Among other important discoveries at Sitagroi, the research resulted in a series of radiocarbon dates that revised chronological relationships. The Sitagroi dates strongly support the view that the Balkan Copper Age was contemporary with the later Neolithic period of the Aegean, and occurred earlier than the Aegean Early Bronze Age or early Troy. The material of Copper Age Sitagroi - the pottery, settlement plan and bone and stone tools - are so similar to the Bulgarian Copper Age that the stratigraphie and the radiocarbon evidence speak in unison. Apparently during the Copper Age (5000 to 3500 b.c.), Sitagroi was linked closer to the Balkans than to the Aegean. The technology of the graphite painted ceramics makes this relationship even more apparent. It was easy to identify the silvery painted graphite ware as it was excavated at Sitagroi. The amounts grew quickly and sherds with various colored backgrounds painted with the special substance continued to be found. But at the time there was nothing to indicate that these wares were unique. The vessel shapes were well known Copper Age types and they fit comfortably into the chronological typology devised for Sitagroi and nearby tells. Yet nothing of the special quality of these ceramics was revealed until I made a series of trips to Bulgaria and Romania to study Neolithic and Copper Age ceramics housed in major and provincial museums. Graphite ware abounded in these collections, but it looked surprisingly different from the Sitagroi July/ August 1979 19</page><page sequence="3">Cross section of graphite painted ware sherd demonstrating ( from outside to center): black paint, oxidized interior and carbon core.

The graphite paint on the Sitagroi ceramics had a sparkling crystalline quality, somewhat like grains of sugar, and it looked fresh and almost brand new. In the National Museum at Bucharest I stared at ceramic artifacts from the Gumelnitza site in Romania which were dismal in comparison. The graphite paint was shadowy and could hardly be seen; in some instances it had disappeared entirely or left a white residue. The very smooth, even greasy quality of the paint gave a gray or tarnished effect to the objects decorated with it. Those vessels completely covered with graphite were somewhat brighter - more like the sherds found at Sitagroi - and the resulting smooth sheen produced a metallic effect. All of these wares, sparkling or dull, had been grouped together into the same ceramic category by archaeologists because of their graphite content. From a technological point of view, however, they are clearly quite different. In order to illustrate various characteristics of graphite ware, it was necessary to determine exactly how the Sitagroi graphite painted ware was manufactured. The results of this study revealed a complex process of pottery decoration indicating a sophisticated Copper Age technology - perhaps ultimately leading to the development of the more complicated process of metalworking. In fact, artifacts made of copper had been found at Sitagroi in the Late Neolithic levels together with a type of pottery with an overall graphite wash which gave a metallic sheen. Clearly this suggests early interest in the use of metal. Archaeologists have been increasingly curious to learn how the complexities of melting, smelting a metal from its ores and alloying (combining two metals in various proportions) could be accomplished as a regular technique before the Bronze Age. The answer must lie in the preceding Copper Age processes of ceramic manufacture and pyro technology, since firing temperatures and the control of 20 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="4">atmospheric oxygen are known to be major considerations in the production of metals as well as pottery. It is not surprising that graphite ware has been a focus of interest for archaeologists who believed that it could only be produced under reducing conditions with little or no oxygen in the firing - a condition necessary for smelting metallic ores. T he Copper Age, Chalcolithic or Eneolithic refers to the late stages of the Neolithic period usually defined as a time of early permanent settlement, domestication of plants and animals, and pottery production. The fairly homogeneous culture complexes of the Copper Age are known collectively as the "Gumelnitza civilization" in Romania, Bulgaria and northern Greece. Typically, the people of this period lived in sedentary communities made up of compact villages located on river banks and terraces or on natural islands in rivers. The settlements were primarily agricultural and depended on wheat, barley, lentils and vetch (a plant with edible pea-like seeds). Cattle, pigs, sheep and goats were also domesticated. Excavations reveal that these farmers lived in houses made of thick clay walls laid on a framework of light wooden posts and clay floors often laid on layers of horizontal logs. The rich ritualistic life of the Gumelnitza civilization is indicated by the tremendous quantities of decorated cult vessels, clay figurines, altars and shrine models recovered. It was also technologically advanced - workshops utilized flint, copper, gold and spondylus shell, implying that craft specialization and some division of labor existed. Native copper and ore were available in southeastern Europe from Transylvania and the mountains of Bulgaria. In the early stages of metalworking, small copper nuggets were cold hammered or heated and beaten into the shapes of needles, fish hooks, pins and beads. Later, when ores were smelted, axes and daggers became part of thé inventory. During the sáme period, gold was collected in quantity in the form of nuggets and dust. The most remarkable gold finds come from the Varna cemetery in Bulgaria, where numerous gold objects such as beads, rings, bracelets and ritual axes were found in connection with "mask graves" of the Goddess of Life, Death and Regeneration. No actual bones were found in these 16 symbolic graves. The goddess was represented by a life-size mask or head of clay which was decorated and surrounded with gold and precious objects. Even grave vessels were painted with gold paint in designs analagous to those of the graphite painted wares from the area, probably indicating one of their uses as ritual equipment. Other evidence for cult practices during this period include clay shrine models, triangular tables, pillar shrines, cult tables or altars, inscribed tablets, anthropomorphic vessels and elaborately decorated pottery which never displays any signs of utilitarian use. Obviously, the painted silvery graphite ware played a role in the ritualistic life of prehistoric southeastern Europe. At Sitagroi, where it was found in quantity, the graphite painted pottery levels have been radiocarbon dated with a true age of approximately 4650 b.c. The graphite painted ceramics of Bulgaria and Romania are typically found with a black background, although red and buff are known. Many sherds from this area, now in the UCLA Old World Museum, also appear dark on cross section, indicating that carbon remained in the fabric or caused smudging as a result of incomplete firing. Smudging is produced by firing in a smoky atmosphere, where partial reduction allows carbon deposits to remain in the pores of the fabric. When there is a lack of oxygen in the "reduction" the iron oxide constituent of the earthenware clay remains in its ferrous or black state. Only when oxygen freely combines with the clay does the iron oxide content turn red or to ferric oxide. Nearly every sample of graphite painted ware from Sitagroi was oxidized. Red and buff backgrounds were common and those with black backgrounds had a red interior indicating use of a black paint. Only in thick walled samples does a carbon core appear. The implication here is that these Copper Age ceramics are most commonly oxidized with smudging. No kilns are known anywhere for the period, therefore contro led reduction is probably not a possibility. These ceramics were probably fired in pits - at Sitagroi massive pits several meters deep were found, containing large amounts of carbon debris. Intensive analysis of the graphite painted ware from Sitagroi was conducted in the ceramics laboratory of the Art Department and the laboratories of the Materials Department of the School of Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles. The equipment used for analysis included Lindberg Hevi-Duty muffle and tunnel kilns with pyrometers - for experimenting with oxidizing and reducing conditions, reproducing samples, refiring samples and firing temperature testing. Also available were a Bausch and Lomb pétrographie microscope and a Nikon stereo zoom microscope used for quick sorting and paint analysis. Many complex July/ August 1979 21</page><page sequence="5">problems arose during the tests and it was decided to use a Norelco X-ray diffractometer to detect trace elements both in the paint and on the surface of the sherds. An electron probe and electron scanning microscope provided detailed information on the crystal structure and changes of these elements. Finally, atomic absorption analysis using an acid digestion bomb was performed by Paul Domeny of the United States Customs Laboratory, San Pedro on the graphite paint in order to determine the percentage of the constituents, particularly the trace elements. These tests were used to learn more about the composition of the paint, firing temperatures and chemical changes in the fabric resulting from techniques of manufacture. As a result, it was possible to identify two types of graphite ware for the Gumelnitza culture complex. So far the first variety has been found north of the Rhodope Mountains in Bulgaria and Romania with only occasional samples located in northern Greece. In this type, the paint is usually shadowy and thinly applied in the form of spiral or geometric designs on a black, red or buff background. Often there is little paint on the sample and it can be easily rubbed or scraped off. It burns away on a secondary experimental firing under oxidizing conditions. The sherd samples are usually thin walled and black in section, although clear orange-red clay fabrics were also found in this category. Firing techniques included smudging for the thoroughly black wares and oxidation for the red fabrics. Pit firing under these conditions does not harm the graphite, since the carbon in it helps to keep out the oxygen during the firing and the ash impurity of the graphite contains silica which helps bond the paint to the vessel. Natural graphite, which can be easily found throughout the mountainous areas of the Balkans, is applied by rubbing it directly onto the ceramic fabric. This accounts for the smooth quality of the paint. Small cones of this natural graphite have been found in the Copper Age levels of the Karanovo mound in Bulgaria. These cones are very pointed, much like the lead in a pencil, indicating the method of use. This variety should not be considered unusual in any way since the technology is in line with the level of pottery manufacture found everywhere else for this period. The second type of graphite ware is found south of the Rhodope Mountains in sites 22 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="6">throughout the Plain of Drama in Greece. In contrast to the first variety, the paint is thickly applied and has a very grainy or crystalline appearance. It is found on vessels with various colored backgrounds and all samples have a brick red interior indicating oxidized firing conditions. The silver colored paint is well bonded, difficult to remove and seldom disappears on refiring even to temperatures over 1000 degrees centigrade. The samples are usually thick walled and on some the firing temperature was so high that the graphite burned away leaving a white silica residue. Unlike the first type, it was impossible to reproduce this technique in the laboratory. This may be due to trace elements not yet identified. X-ray diffraction, however, shows the main constitutent to be graphite. The scanning electron microscope has defined silica crystals in various stages of formation indicating transformation through ascending and high temperatures, possible only under oxidizing conditions. It seems that the carbon in the graphite causes local reduction of only the paint, and the high ash content of the graphite provides, in some samples, up to 75 per cent of. silica available for crystallization and bonding to the sherd surface as a glass. In fact, the sharp outlines of some silica crystals seen under the microscope indicate that the graphite was originally crushed and mixed with some medium for painting onto the sherd surface. This accounts for the greater amount of silica present and explains the more permanent bonding of this variety of paint. The astounding revelation in this research is best seen in the unusual X-ray diffraction patterns. The peaks on the readout strips definitely indicate the formation of iron carbide and carbon iron between the surface of the sherd and the paint. In the case of the graphite painted pottery, the high iron content of the clay itself reacted with the high carbon content .of the natural graphite in the appropriate temperature range to produce iron. Iron carbide is a simple compound of iron and carbon, while carbon iron is the simplest form of all varieties of iron; it can be formed at relatively low temperatures when iron oxides are present as a flux, which happened with ancient graphite wares. The production of Sitagroi graphite painted ware is unique because it was regularly produced for over 1,000 years under the conditions required for earthenware clays, which are fired in the lower temperature ranges - in this case, about 1,000 degrees centigrade and without a kiln. The result was probably unintentional and only a variation of the main northern type of pottery. This technique worked, however, and continued to be popular even though Copper Age potters were unaware of what was truly happening. Nevertheless, this experiment with the elements advanced metallurgy - it demonstrated how impure ingredients can combine. Copper Age potters were learning how to reduce locally or fully by means of a chemical process which allowed the carbon to extract oxygen from the product or atmosphere, such as in smudging. The temperatures required for either pottery manufacture or smelting are not as significant as the reduction process itself because impurities always contain ingredients which lower the actual temperature needed to produce the results. In the future, archaeologists will need to continue to study the technological processes actually used during antiquity for the manufacture of goods. In this case, the study of how graphite was applied to pottery is just as significant as analyzing the shapes and decoration. The technologies that are revealed are another satisfying way to appreciate the inventiveness and creativity of the ancient potters of southeastern Europe.
