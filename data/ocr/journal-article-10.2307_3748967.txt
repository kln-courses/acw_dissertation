<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PHILOSOPHICAL RELEVANCE OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE, FREDERICK C. COPLESTON, S.J., M.A. i. The meaning of the title of this essay is not clear. And something must be done towards clarifying it, in order that the question at issue may be understood. The term "religious experience" has a wide range of meaning. It might mean experience of God, in the sense that it is taken from the outset to signify experience of an existent Being whom it is proper to call God. Or it might mean experience which is claimed by the person who enjoys it to be experience of God, though we do not assume from the outset the validity of the claim. Or it might mean experience which is connected in such a way with the thought of God as to warrant its being called religious even though the claim is not made that it is experience of the divine reality itself. Further, some people might wish to say that there are experiences which possess certain qualities in virtue of which the experiences can or should be called religious even though they are not directly connected with the thought of God. Examples of religious experience in the last- mentioned sense might be a certain sense of sublimity enjoyed while contemplating a mountain-scene or of mystery while gazing into the depths of a forest. Leaving the matter there for the moment, I turn to the term "philo- sophical relevance." When I ask whether religious experience possesses philosophical relevance, I intend to ask whether it increases our knowledge of reality. It might do this in at any rate two ways. It might increase our knowledge of the experiencer, the subject. And it might provide grounds for saying that there is a Being of such a nature that it is proper to call this Being "God." I propose to confine my attention to this second theme. In other words, the principal subject for discussion is whether religious experience affords adequate grounds for affirming the existence of God. It is immediately evident that the term "religious experience," as used in this discussion, cannot be given from the outset the first of the possible meanings to which I have alluded above. For if we assume that there is experience of an existent divine Being, we assume the existence of God. I also exclude the last of the possible meanings which I mentioned.2 In fact I propose to confine myself I This paper represents a lecture given at The Royal Institute of Philosophy in March, I956. 2 This exclusion should not be taken as equivalent to a flat denial that feelings of sublimity and so on have any religious significance. Perhaps they have. But I do not intend to discuss the matter here. 229</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY to consideration of religious experience in the second of the meanings mentioned, namely to experience which is claimed by the person who enjoys it to be experience of God. And I wish to inquire whether we have adequate grounds, or can have adequate grounds, for thinking that this claim is sometimes true. I must emphasize, however, that I am talking about the external observer. I am not asking, for instance, whether it is psychologically possible for a person who enjoys certain types of experience to doubt the existence of God while the experience lasts. I am asking whether the external observer, if I may so describe him, has or can have adequate grounds for thinking that certain types of experience can best be explained by supposing that they are in fact what they are claimed to be, experience of God. And in speaking of adequate grounds I prescind, of course, from purely theological considerations and presupposi- tions. What do I mean by the term "God"? I do not think that the term can reasonably be used to signify either the things which compose what we call the material world or finite human selves or both. For to affirm that the only existing realities are material things and human selves is, in ordinary usage, to affirm atheism. Hence at the very least I mean by God a Being which transcends material things and which is not identical with the human self. True, even though I do not wish to presuppose a specifically Christian concept of God, this description is very far from being all that is usually meant by the term. The first question to be asked, however, is whether religious experience affords empirical evidence of the existence of a Being other than the experiencer and the material world. For if a negative answer had to be given to this question, it would be senseless to discuss the Being's nature and attributes. It is sometimes said that one cannot raise the question of God's existence "outside religion," and that "inside religion" there is no sense in raising it. The religious man, when left to himself, no more raises the question of God's existence than we raise the question of the existence of the air which we are breathing. "Outside religion," however, the word "God" has no meaning. The question of God's existence cannot, therefore, be raised. This is not a point of view with which I find myself in agreement. That certain experiences occur which are grouped under the heading of religious experience is an empirical fact. And there seems to me to be no cogent reason why the external observer should not raise the question whether or not the occurrence of such experiences affords at least probable evidence of the existence of a Being other than the experiencer, other finite selves and the material world. 2. In modern theological literature we hear a good deal about meeting or encounter with God and about the I-Thou relationship. 230</page><page sequence="3">THE RELEVANCE OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE The religious consciousness, it is said, is characterized by this relation- ship. That is to say, for the religious consciousness God is not an "It," an object about which a man thinks in the same way in which he may think about the moon or about electrons or about the relations between the subconscious and the conscious. The metaphysician, it is true, may think about God in this way or at least in an analogous manner. But metaphysical reflection about the Ens a se is not the same thing as the encounter with God which is characteristic of the religious consciousness. My reason for mentioning this theme is sufficiently obvious. I announced my intention of understanding by the term "religious experience" for purposes of this discussion experience which is claimed by the person who enjoys it to be experience of God. And what is often called encounter or meeting with God clearly comes under this heading. We can ask, therefore, whether reflection on this experience discloses evidence that it is in fact what it is claimed to be. But first of all I wish to make the following point. When people speak of encounter with God as a characteristic of the religious consciousness, they are talking, I think, of a common phenomenon, of an experience, that is to say, which is commonly enjoyed by devout Christians, Jews and Moslems and which is not a relatively rare experience such as mysticism. Hence I leave mysticism out of account for the moment, though I shall return to the subject later. I cannot undertake to discuss the relation between "ordinary" religious experience and mysticism, because I do not think that I could do this without introducing theological considerations which I wish to avoid. But it is clear, I think, that those who speak of encounter or meeting with God are not talking in an exclusive sense about mysticism, even if they would include it. Now, the experience of the I-Thou relationship or of personal encounter with God can perhaps be regarded, from the point of view of the experiencer, as an experimental verification of a pre-existing belief. Take the case of someone who believes already in a God with whom man can enter into communication. If he then has the experience which is called encountering or meeting God, in prayer let us say, this experience counts for him as an experimental veri- fication of his belief. And his life of prayer helps to sustain his belief. This is, I think, a common enough case. And generally speaking those who have what I have called "ordinary" religious experience are those who already believe in God. True, the experience may be itself the origin of real belief. But in such a case a man generally has already an idea of God, gained probably through his education, in the light of which he interprets the experience. The question arises, however, whether religious experience of this type affords any evidence in favour of God's existence for those 23I</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHY who do not already believe in God and who look at the experience from outside, so far as it is possible to do this. For this to be the case, it seems that there would have to be some feature of the experience which could not be adequately explained except by postulating God's existence or at least which could be more adequately explained by postulating God's existence than by not doing so. And there appears to be some considerable difficulty in showing that there is any such feature. For it might be maintained that, once given the initial belief on the part of the experiencer, the experience can be adequately explained in terms of this belief. The validity of the belief may be provable on other grounds, metaphysical grounds for example. But this is not the point at issue. The question is whether we can point to any feature or features of the experience under discussion, when viewed from the outside, in support of the validity of the belief. And the comment might be made that though devout worshippers of Isis probably enjoyed some experience of encountering Isis, this does not show that Isis exists. Given the belief, the experience can be explained in psychological terms. Similarly, it might be argued, the religious experience of a monotheist does not show that the God in whom he believes exists. For, given the belief, the psychologist can account for the experience without postulating a transcendent object of the experience. The reply might be made that there is some confusion here. For the problem is not that of justifying some particular conception of Deity. True, Isis was popularly conceived as an anthropomorphic goddess, and as such she belongs to the realm of mythology. But it might be argued that the religious experience of the devout worshipper of Isis was fundamentally an encounter with the divine, not with a mythological figure. The properly religious element in the experience of the worshipper of Isis is not without affinity to the religious experience of the devout monotheist. Did not Apuleius in the Metamorphoses speak of the one Deity worshipped under many names? And cannot we find similar utterances in the Vedas, with reference to Indian polytheism? This may well be true. But we ought to be careful not to pre- suppose the validity of monotheism on grounds other than those provided by religious experience. I mean, we ought to be careful, for purposes of this present discussion, not to interpret the religious experience of the worshipper of Isis in the light of a belief in mono- theism, resting on other grounds than religious experience, and then to use this interpretation to show that the belief is substantiated by the experience so interpreted. It might, indeed, be argued that in all religious experience there is a sense of the Transcendent, and that though the way in which the Transcendent is conceived generally depends on pre-existing 232</page><page sequence="5">THE RELEVANCE OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE beliefs, the sense itself is most reasonably explained as awareness of existent divine Being. In this case, however, it seems that the cases most likely to convince the external observer that there is such an objective awareness will be those cases in which the subject of the experience is, prima facie at least, most acted upon and in which the encounter is most evidently the result of the activity of Being other than the experiencer. I turn, therefore, to the consideration of mysticism. To do so is, of course, to limit the scope of the discussion. But a man who does not already believe in God is not likely to be brought to this belief by a consideration of other people's religious experience unless it can be shown to him that the experience cannot be adequately explained if we not admit the activity of a Being transcending the self, other selves and the material environment. And as this activity would seem to be more evident, prima facie at least, in mystical experience than in ordinary religious experience, it is, I think, only natural to turn to a consideration of mysticism. 3. The first point to be made is that in speaking of mysticism I am not speaking of phenomena such as imaginative visions, voices, levitation or even of ecstasies and raptures when considered under their physical or corporeal aspects. We all know that people "see things" and hear voices without any even fprima facie connection with intimate union with God, and that there can be pathological states resembling ecstasy which are susceptible of a purely naturalistic interpretation. Nor am I speaking of the not so uncommon stage of mystical experience in which (if I may beg the question for the moment) the action of God is practically imperceptible but which is characterized rather by the prolonged act of wanting God. I am speaking of states in which the subject is aware of being acted upon, of an intimate union and one-ing with a Being immeasurably greater than himself. I am talking, if you like, of what Plotinus calls "the flight of the alone to the Alone," of the "vision" in which beholder and beheld are as one. But if mystical experience is understood primarily in the sense of a purely interior experience, it is obvious that the external observer is dependent on the testimony of mystics. Some mystical phenomena are in principle visible by anyone, ecstasy in its corporeal aspect for example. But no external observer can see the accompanying interior experience. The question arises, therefore, how far we can be expected to accept this testimony. The first remark which I wish to make on this topic is that in a certain number of cases we have at our disposal the normal criteria for deciding whether a person intended to tell the truth or not. There certainly have been pseudo-mystical charlatans and people who wished to draw attention to themselves. But if, for instance, 233</page><page sequence="6">P H I L O S O P H Y we find St. Teresa describing her experiences in writing because she has been told to do so by those whom she regards as possessing authority over her, and if we find that in ordinary life she was a woman of good sense and who was recognized as being free from pride and vanity, it is at least more probable that in her writings she intended to tell the truth as she saw it than that she intended to write what shes knew or suspected to be false. To avoid any possible misunderstanding, I must emphasize that I am not suggesting that the life of a mystic proves the truth of what he or she says. But it seems to me to be obvious that we can legiti- mately use available information about the life and character of a mystic to help us to decide whether he or she was in good faith and intended to tell the truth. This seems to me to be a matter of common sense. One special reason, however, why we cannot use the probable good faith of a mystic to prove the truth of all he says is this. What a mystic says or writes about his experience is written subsequently to the experience itself. And he is likely to interpret the experience in the light of beliefs which he already possesses. Let us suppose for the sake of argument that two men, the one a Christian and the other a Hindu, enj oy similar mystical experiences. The former is likely to interpret his experience in terms of Christian theism, while the latter, if he already accepts a monistic version of the philosophy of the Ve- danta, is likely to interpret his experience in terms of this philosophy. And when we have reason to think that the subsequent interpretation of an experience is probably due to, or at least influenced by, beliefs which precede the experience, we obviously cannot be expected to accept the occurrence of the experience as conclusive proof of the truth of the interpretation. In other words, the mystic's experience, even if genuine, does not guarantee the mystic's interpretation of it. No theological or philosophical statements which he may make are exempt from critical discussion in the light of the appropriate norms for judging whether such statements are true or false. Diversity of interpretation can often be explained in terms of different previously-held beliefs. But is there any fundamental agreement in the testimony of different mystics? If we try to allow for elements which are probably due to pre-existing beliefs, we find I think, common testimony (at least in what are claimed to be the higher reaches of mystical experience) of intimate union with a Being which is felt as immeasurably greater than the finite self and which is felt as being the ultimate reality or, in some sense, as the only true reality. Further, this union is experienced as something given, as an invasion or transformation or taking-up of the self. Hence some psychologists of the religious consciousness speak of the "givenness" of mystical experience as being at any rate one of its 234</page><page sequence="7">THE RELEVANCE OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE special characteristics. It may be said perhaps that I am able to find this common testimony because I recognize as "mystics" only those who enjoy certain types of experience. But it is, I think, an empirical fact that we can find marked similarities in the descriptions of mystical experience which have been given by mystics belonging to different periods and to different cultural and religious traditions. And this remains a fact even if we exclude a certain number of writers who are sometimes spoken of as "mystical" writers. The question then arises whether this element of givenness can be adequately explained without reference to a metaphysical cause of or factor in the experience. And some, of course, maintain that it can be. (J. H. Leuba is one of these.) They maintain that there is no factor discoverable in mystical experience which cannot be explained naturalistically through the operation of psychological and physiological causes. It may well be that it is the character of given- ness which makes the mystic spontaneously attribute his experience to contact with a reality other than himself. But the character of givenness accompanies the emergence of mental processes from the subconscious into consciousness. To take a simple example, a pious person may be troubled by conflicts, ideas and temptations which seem to come from without, and he attributes them to diabolical agency or suggestion. But the psychoanalyst can reveal the origins of these mental events in the subconscious. The character of givenness, therefore, provides no proof that mystical experience is what the mystic thinks it to be. And some writers would even go so far as to say that mystical experience can be reproduced artificially, as by the use of certain drugs. Others would not allow that any adequate purely naturalistic explanation of mystical experience has yet been given. There are, indeed, a number of mystical phenomena, in a wide sense of the term, which occur even when there is no real question of contact with God. And in such cases naturalistic interpretations can be given. Further, it is difficult to exclude naturalistic explanations of such phenomena even when they are associated with the mystical experience proper. But no conclusive naturalistic explanation of the latter has yet been provided. And as for the artificial reproduction of mystical states by the use of drugs, descriptions of the states attained by such means do not appear to correspond with the descrip- tions given by the chief mystical writers of what they consider to be their most important experience. In any case the effects on life and conduct of the experiences of a St. John of the Cross or of a St. Teresa do not appear to follow in the case of "mystical" states deliberately and artificially produced; and this seems to indicate a difference between the two sets of states. It has yet to be shown that anyone whose "mystical experience" consists in states pro- 235</page><page sequence="8">PHILOSOPHY duced by drugs is a suitable candidate for beatification or canoniza- tion.' It is arguable, of course, that even if no adequate naturalistic explanation of mystical experience has yet been given, we are not entitled to exclude a priori the possibility of such an explanation being provided at some future date. But some writers2 contend that even if a purely psychological account of mystical experience can or might be given, it by no means follows that the mystic's own account of the matter is false. Naturalistic explanations can be given, for instance, of the movements of the planets. But the Christian does not suppose that this fact excludes the divine activity in Nature or that God's activity is confined to miraculous "interventions." Similarly, it might be true both that a naturalistic psychological account of mystical experience could be given and also that this experience was what the mystic takes it to be. For the matter of that God might, as William James suggested in his Varieties of Religious Experience, act on the subconscious. The general contention to which I have alluded in the last para- graph, namely that a psychological account of mystical experience does not necessarily exclude the possibility of the mystic's account being true, seems to me to be valid. But I doubt whether it helps very much in the present discussion. If a Christian believes that God's activity is manifested in the movements of the planets, he does so on other grounds than inspection of the planets' behaviour. If a theologian or a metaphysician believes that God "concurs" with every human act, including free acts, he does so on other grounds than empirical observation of these acts. Similarly, if an adequate naturalistic explanation of mystical experience could be given, the contention that the experience is at the same time the result of divine activity would have to be supported on other grounds than analysis of the experience as an empirical phenomenon. But it is with the experimental argument for God's existence that we are at present concerned. That is to say, we are asking whether mystical experience, so far as it can be known by the external observer, provides any evidence in favour of the conclusion that there exists a Being whom it is proper to call "God." It will not do, therefore, to presuppose the existence of God on other grounds and then to say that mystical experience, even if it is susceptible of a purely psycho- I It may be said that the religious mystics themselves have employed a tech- nique, for example ascetic practices. But the Christian mystics at least adopted ascetic practices for other purposes than for inducing mystical experience. In any case they did not regard the relation of mystical experience to ascetic practices as being that of effect to cause in the same sense in which states induced by drugs are the effects of the latter. 2 I am indebted for this idea to a reading of Professor R. H. Thouless's valuable little work, An Introduction to the Psychology of Religion. 236</page><page sequence="9">THE RELEVANCE OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE logical explanation, is nevertheless the result of divine activity. It might be; but from the point of view adopted for purposes of this discussion, the point of view of the agnostic, this consideration is not of much help. There is, however, another consideration which seems to me to be relevant. The highest mystical states are admitted by the mystics themselves to be inexpressible. Mystical writers have, indeed, tried to suggest their nature by the use of anology and imagery; but they recognize at the same time that nobody can really understand what the experience is unless he has enjoyed it himself. Now if we accept this view of the matter, and we can hardly avoid doing so, it appears to follow that no external observer can ever know that an adequate naturalistic explanation of mystical experience has been given. Nor can he legitimately state that it could in principle be given. For he does not really know what the experience is about which he is speaking. Similarly, he cannot recognize any of the abnormal states produced by the use of drugs as equivalent to the summits of mystical experience described in extremely obscure terms by St. John of the Cross. He can experiment with mescaline for instance, if he wishes to; but he does not know and cannot know that the results are com- parable to the supreme experience of the mystics. Unfortunately, however, the very reason which militates against the claim that mystical experience is susceptible of a purely natural- istic explanation militates equally against the claim that mystical experience is philosophically relevant in the sense in which I have been using the term. For if the external observer cannot know what the mystical experience is, he is unlikely to be much impressed by an argument for God's existence which is based on such experience. One can doubtless exaggerate the ineffability of mystical experience. Mystical writers would hardly have attempted to suggest the nature of their experience by the use of analogy and imagery if they had thought that no idea at all, however inadequate, could be communi- cated. At the same time it appears that the external observer is not in a position to "recognize" the higher levels of mystical experience. In this case he can never know that any naturalistic explanation which is offered really is an explanation. Nor, on the other hand, can he feel confident that a supernatural explanation is required. 4. Readers of this paper will understand that I am not concerned with edification or with religious exhortation. But some may well feel disatisfied with the inconclusive position which I seem to have reached. And this dissatisfaction may arise, not because of the absence of edifying sentiments, but because it is felt that something important has been omitted and that the scope of the discussion has been too restricted. As I share this dissatisfaction, I wish to broaden somewhat the scope of the discussion and to inquire whether we can 237</page><page sequence="10">P H I L O S O P H Y make a little more of the experimental or empirical argument for God's existence. It is, I think, a fact that those who are impressed by religious experience, especially by mystical experience, as testimony for the existence of God do not have in mind simply the interior experience itself. So far as this experience can be known from outside, by description rather than by acquaintance, they see it in the context not only of the lives of the mystics but also of the general history of religion and, indeed, of human culture. They see, as it were, a pattern which suggests to them an irruption of supernatural life and varying degrees of contact with the source of this life, a source trans- cending the material world and the finite self. In other words, the pattern suggests to them the hypothesis of God's existence. And even if they would not pretend to be able to exclude a priori and conclusively the possibility of a psychological explanation of the empirical data, they would maintain that the hypothesis of God's existence is more reasonable and makes better sense of the data than any naturalistic explanation yet advanced. This line of argument has, of course, its difficulties. Suppose that we point to the characters and actions of religious mystics such as St. Francis of Assisi and argue with Bergson that it is more probable that the lives of these men and women are the result of contact with a source of life other than themselves than they are not. It is, indeed, scarcely necessary to remark that if a man does not admire or value the qualities and activities of a person like St. Francis, any line of argument which presupposes the admirable and valuable character of these qualities and activities will to this extent fail to impress him. But even if we do admire the character and actions of a St. Francis, it is still difficult to prove that they were the result of mystical experience. After all, outstanding examples of self-sacrifice and of charity can be found in the lives of people whom we do not ordinarily regard as mystics. Nevertheless, the line of argument to which I have alluded undoubtedly weighs with some minds. Indeed, it seems to some people much more impressive than any purely metaphysical argument. But is it simply a question of some people seeing a pattern which others do not see or of one man seeing one pattern while another man sees another pattern? If so, it might be objected that the man who sees the pattern of varying degrees of contact with God does so because he already believes in a God with whom human beings can have communication. Perhaps this last remark, intended as an objection or criticism, suggests a way in which the approach to God's existence through reflection on religious experience in general and on mystical experi- ence in particular can form part of a cumulative argument for God's 238</page><page sequence="11">THE RELEVANCE OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE existence. If a person has come to the conclusion on other grounds that it is in some degree probable that there is a God who could conceivably be the object of human experience, the occurrence of religious experience in general and of mystical experience in par- ticular, especially when seen in the general context of human life, might serve for him as an empirical verification of the hypothesis at which he has already arrived. We would then have, it might be claimed, a general line of argument somewhat analogous to the pro- cess of hypothesis and verification in the sciences. In this case the conclusion would be more or less probable; but it would be capable of indefinitely progressive verification. This is substantially the position of Bergson as presented in The Two Sources of Morality and Religion. And it is a line of thought with which I find myself in sympathy. But there is, it seems to me, a serious objection against it. A scientist may form a hypothesis and then deduce that if certain requisite conditions were fulfilled and operations performed (I mean, if certain experimental work were carried out), certain events should occur if the hypothesis were true. And if the events do in fact occur when the experiment is performed, this tends to verify or confirm the hypothesis. But we are not in a position to make analogous experiments with regard to mystical experience. We cannot make experiments with other people. It may be said that I can perform experiments with myself. That is to say, I can fulfil certain conditions or perform certain actions and see what results in the way of religious experience. But to me at least it seems obvious that, apart from other considerations, one of the pre- requisite conditions would be that I should commit myself to religious belief and to a truly religious attitude; and in this case I would no longer be the external observer of whom we have been speaking. Of course, religious experience might suddenly "happen" to me, as in the case of those sudden conversions to which William James devoted his attention; but such an event could hardly be called an experi- ment in the sense in which we speak of controlled experiment in science. If, therefore, we wish to maintain that religious experience in general and mystical experience in particular can play a veri- ficatory role in regard to the hypothesis of God's existence, we cannot, I think, interpret verification here as strictly analogous to experi- mental verification in science. But not all scientific verification takes the form of controlled experiment. An astronomer is not in a position to experiment with the heavenly bodies in the same way that a chemist can experiment with chemical substances. He may, however, be able to deduce from a hypothesis that if the hypothesis were true certain phenomena should be observable. And it might be argued that mystical experience can play a verificatory role analogous to that played by these 239</page><page sequence="12">PHILOSOPHY observable astronomical phenomena. It does not appear, indeed, that the analogy could be a strict one. For while it might be deduced from an astronomical hypothesis that certain phenomena must occur if the hypothesis is true, we can hardly argue that religious experience in general and mystical experience in particular must occur if there is a God who could be the object of human experience. However, we might pass over this objection and say that there is an analogy though not necessarily a strict one. If there is a God who could conceivably be the object of human experience, then it is tautologous to say that religious experience is possible. And if in fact it is found to occur, its occurrence serves as verification of the hypothesis. Unfortunately the matter is not quite so simple as this. If we say that the occurrence of mystical experience verifies the hypothesis that there is a God who could be the object of human experience, we might mean either of two things. We might mean that analysis of instances of mystical experience shows them to be what they are claimed by the mystics to be, namely instances of contact with God. But as we saw in preceding sections, it is somewhat difficult for the external observer to assure himself that this is in fact the case. Or we might mean that from the hypothesis that there is a God who could be the object of human experience we can deduce that certain types of experience, considered in terms of a purely psycho- logical description, could occur, and that instances of mystical experience are instances of these types of experience. In this case we would, indeed, have some analogy with the scientific process of hypo- thesis and verification. At the same time I cannot think of anyone who has argued explicitly in precisely this way; and at first hearing at least it sounds a very odd line of argument. Who, it might be asked, would ever think of deducing from the hypothesis that there exists a God who could be the object of human experience the con- clusion that if such contact were to take place it would be accompanied by certain psychological experiences, and then of looking round to see whether in fact there are instances of such experiences occurring? Of course, the fact that a line of argument appears odd does not necessarily constitute a disproof of its validity. But if the argument which I have mentioned appears to us to be very odd and "artificial," it suggests at any rate that those who are impressed by religious experience in general and mystical experience in particular as testimony in favour of God's existence have not got this sort of argument in mind. But is the argument really quite so remote as I have suggested from the way in which the minds of those who are impressed by mystical experience as evidence for God's existence actually work? If I may be permitted a crude over-simplification, we can say that 240</page><page sequence="13">THE RELEVANCE OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE the mystic passes beyond all things which can be represented by the imagination and has the experience of entering what has been described as "darkness" or "night" or "the cloud of unknowing." Those comparatively few persons who pass beyond this stage have the experience,' in varying degrees, of union with a Being immeasur- ably greater than themselves, of being-taken-possession-of, of "trans- formation." Now, it is arguable that those who are impressed by mystical experience as evidence for the existence of God are im- pressed, in part at least, because they see in this succession of states "what they would expect" if there is a transcendent God who could be the object of human experience. In this case the line of thought at the back of their minds, even if they never formulate it explicitly to themselves, seems to resemble the line of argument which I first stigmatized as "odd." If there is a transcendent God who could be the object of human experience, one would expect that, for such experience to take place, man would have first to "pass beyond" the imaginable things to which his attention is first directed by nature. And this passing beyond would naturally involve "night" or "dark- ness." And any succeeding experience of union or contact would naturally be inexpressible save in terms of analogies and images taken from the world of "common experience." What I have been saying may give the impression that I am preoccupied with assimilating arguments for God's existence to the scientific process of hypothesis and verification. But this impression would be based on a misunderstanding. In this paper I am treating exclusively of one particular argument, namely that from religious experience. This argument has been presented by some writers, notably by Bergson, in a form which is claimed to be analogous to the scientific process of hypothesis and verification. It is therefore relevant to inquire if in fact there is or can be any analogy and, if so, where it lies. 5. It may be said that in this discussion I have not arrived at any definite, positive results, and that the reason for this is that I have persisted in looking at the matter from the point of view of the external observer. True, in the last section I shifted to the point of view of the man who already believes on grounds other than religious experience that it is probable that there exists a God who could conceivably be the object of human experience. But I have repre- sented this initial belief as analogous to a scientific hypothesis; and to this extent I have persisted in keeping to the point of view of the external observer. Yet those who are impressed by the argument I I am using the word "experience" here to signify experience considered in its subjective aspect. I mean, by saying "experience of union with a Being" I do not intend to assume that the experience is necessarily what the subject feels it to be. D 24I</page><page sequence="14">P H I L O S O P H Y from religious experience in general and mystical experience in particular are not external observers if one means by this term those who are completely indifferent to religion. Even the "religious agnostic" (the man who has some "sense" of the Transcendent, of a reality other than the visible world, but who for various reasons is agnostic about any definite conceptual presentation of the Deity) is not an external observer. Why not simply admit that the argument from religious experience possesses force only in the minds of those who stand already "within religion"? It may very well be the case that, as I maintained in the first section, the question whether religious experience provides any evidence for the existence of God is a question which can be raised "outside religion." But the affirmative answer to the question impresses only those who stand to some degree "within religion." The hostile critic will say that their liability to be impressed is due to their proneness to snatch at anything which looks like an empirical verification of the belief which they wish to hold. But it is also arguable that they are impressed because they have already some knowledge by acquaintance of religious experience. Even the religious agnostic, in the sense alluded to, must be allowed to have some knowledge from within of religious experience, unless one wishes to circumscribe the meaning of religious experience in a very narrow way and to limit it to certain experiences in a place of worship or at a prie-dieu. And the reason why these people are prone to see in mystical experience an empirical confirmation of their belief is that they have a "sympathetic" insight into it and see in it, even if they cannot fully understand it, a prolongation and deepening of an experience of which they themselves already possess some awareness. It seems to me to be true that those who are impressed by the argument from religious experience are generally those who already possess some belief in God or who at least wish to believe in God. And it is arguable that this "wish," when sincere, expresses what may reasonably be described as some degree of religious experience. But it might then be argued perhaps that these people see in mystical experience not so much evidence of the existence of a reality other than themselves and the material world as evidence of the nature of this reality.i And this is a matter with which I cannot deal in this I The question of the relation between mystical experience and interpreta- tion of the nature of God is an interesting question. In the case of those Sufi mystics, for example, who spoke of God in terms of "friend" and "lover" and who were conscious of their departure from the legalistic Mohammedan tradition, how far was the change in the conception of God due to their mystical experience and how far did it precede this experience, being shaped, for instance, by Christian influences? Such questions are difficult to answer. But if it could be shown that their conception of God was primarily due to their mystical experience, this would be a point of some importance. 242</page><page sequence="15">THE RELEVANCE OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE paper. It doubtless comes under the general heading of "the philo- sophical relevance of religious experience"; but I have deliberately confined my attention to consideration of one particular point. A final remark. If in this paper I have dealt with the argument from religious experience in a rather critical way, I should not wish it to be thought that this was due to the fact that I am associated with a philosophical tradition in which no stress is laid on this particular line of argument. It is, indeed, a line of argument which appeals to me. But one has to examine what sort of an argument it is and what, if anything, is shown by it. I do not profess, however, to have done more than to suggest some lines of reflection which have occurred to me. I make no pretence whatever of having given a definitive treatment. 243</page></plain_text>
