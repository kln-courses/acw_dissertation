For the moment, let me leave aside the question of whether these books present a new or even revolutionary approach to Jewish Studies and turn instead to the sin- gularity of their near- simultaneous publication. What accounts for this convergence of critical attention on Jewish sex and the Jewish body? From one point of view, the critical examination of Jews andJudaism from the perspective of corporeal and sexual experience reflects a larger</page><page sequence="2">trend in the humanities and social sciences. Foucault's writings on sexuality in the seventies and eighties brought the body back into the humanities-one can almost say, brought nature and culture back to- gether-by insisting on the historical and discursive contingency of medical or scientific "facts." In works like the three-volume History of Sexuality, Foucault set the stage for a spectrum of approaches to the body, from Elaine Scarry's magisterial humanism in her 1985 The Body in Pain to the Zone collections, subtitled Fragments toward a History of the Body, with their taste for the eccentric and eye for colorful detail. It is perhaps not so surprising that Foucault's work also found an eager audience in religious studies. In much the same way that Foucault had challenged commonly held notions of the sexual repressiveness of Victorian society and the quest for sexual liberation of our own, Caroline Walker Bynum's 1987 Holy Feast and Holy Fast and Peter Brown's 1988 The Body and Society disrupted stereotypes about the importance and meaning of Christian celibacy and asceticism.2 In this larger context, the appearance of the books under review here represents a kind of academic "Doppler effect," with Jewish Studies riding a crest that peaked elsewhere a few years earlier-actually a rather minor lag for a discipline so often oblivious to or amused by trends in neighboring fields. Cultural analysis of the body in Jewish Studies, however, is not just a sign that scholarship in this field is moving closer to those critical movements that have shaken the humanities in general. The books under discussion here can just as readily be placed in the context of a specifically Jewish conversation, one that is certainly as old as Jewish Studies itself. In this context, the contemporary scholarship on Jewish "eros" and "carnality," the "Jewish nose," or on "God's phallus" strikes yet another blow to whatever remains of the Wissenschaft desJudentums' agenda (and its precursors in Maimonides and Hellenistic philosophy) of describingJudaism primarily through its intellectual, ethical or spir- itual dimensions. It is to this version ofJudaism that much of the work here is directed. As Howard Eilberg-Schwartz writes in his introduction to People of the Body, Jews are not only the "People of the Book," but also a "community of seed," whose books, moreover, "are deeply concerned with the body and bodily processes."3 Given the power remaining in this conversation on the nature ofJudaism, it is no surprise that Jewish scholars should have so quickly recognized the critical potential of "body studies." There may be an unwitting irony in this move, though: the critique of the Wissenschaft desJudentums' "spiritualizing" ofJudaism was that it was apologetic, motivated by a need to render Judaism fit for non-Jewish, or Christian, eyes. Is the present rehabilitation of the "erotic" or "carnal"Jew yet another apologetic framing of Jewish expe- [116] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="3">rience, directed this time to a different audience, but one perhaps no less dogmatic? The impulse toward the cultural study of the body and the enthusi- asm with which the first such works were greeted are easily understood: the move toward the body came in the nick of time, rescuing the humanities from an increasingly self-referential, abstract and seemingly inescapable focus on language and discourse. But had the prison-house really been breached? How, in fact, is it possible to study "the body?" In the case of Jewish Studies, one might rephrase the question: How does one study "the People of the Body" (in Eilberg-Schwartz's provoc- ative phrase) without studying, once again, the textual artifacts of "the People of the Book?" The difficulty is not only that historians, scholars of religion and literary critics work within a discipline rooted in the verbal, it lies also in the incommensurability of physical experience and intellectual expression. Is "the body" just another rhetorical category, or can it function to explain or ground discourses? "The body," as it turns out, is a curiously elusive and slippery subject, despite or perhaps because of its position as "the real." Elaine Scarry's work takes its impetus from this very gap between bodily experience and language, tracing human culture to the impossibility of communicating pain: "Whatever pain achieves," Scarry writes, "it achieves in part through its unsharability, and it ensures this unsharability through its resistance to language."4 Most other cultural studies sidestep the Cartesian dualism altogether, surveying the discourses on the body-medical records, anthropological reports, popular accounts, legal briefs, demographic reports, church studies-in the hope of trapping its subject. Brown, for instance, uses such noncanonical material to present a panoply of political and social explanations for the various forms of early Christian sexual renunciation. Some forms of celibacy could relieve the difficul- ties of finding mates in a marginalized subculture, for example, or provide the Church with a corps of workers, in addition to visibly demonstrating the celibate's adherence to the official Christian belief that the end of days was near. But subcanonical material that can shed new light on the corporeal experience of various cultures has not always been available to scholars of the Bible or Talmud, for example, where discussions of the body occupy the well-perused center of the canon rather than its obscure margins. If a new attention to the body is to defamiliarize these fields, it will have to be by finding new interpretive strategies for approaching the canon, rather than by uncovering pre- viously unexplored material. Examples of such strategies might be found, once again, in recent work on Christianity. Bynum's analysis of medieval Christian women's religious use of eating and fasting, for [117] Naomi Seidman Carnal Knowledge</page><page sequence="4">instance, steers clear of contemporary psychoanalytic research on fe- male anorexia, which tends to collapse eating-and other physical functions-into the general category of sexuality. In arguing for the importance of food as sustenance (rather than merely symbol) to me- dieval Christian Europe, Bynum also makes a persuasive case for aban- doning the sexual knowingness of the post-Freudian academy for the curiosity of a scholarship intent on understanding a society truly differ- ent from one's own. Bynum's work, with its attention to physical func- tions other than sexuality-birth, lactation, excretion, and, above all, mortality-opens important new avenues for cultural studies, avenues only tentatively explored in the Jewish Studies texts discussed here. 1 TheJew's Body provides ample evidence that scientific discourse-in this case, the nineteenth-century medical and anthropological research on theJewish "race"-most properly belongs alongside fiction and fantasy literature. Gilman provides us with a museum of the outlandish, docu- menting in photographs, caricatures and medical sketches not the corporeal experience ofJews but rather how their bodies looked to the doctors and journalists of the late nineteenth century. Perhaps in im- itation of the illogic of antisemitic fantasies ofJewish bodies, Gilman's book is itself a fragmented history, moving from such subjects as the Jewish voice to theJewish nose to theJewish foot (whimsically subtitled: "A Foot-note to the Jewish Body"). While The Jew's Body is an invaluable resource for the prehistory of Nazi "science," Gilman's particular con- tribution to this material is his poststructural approach: he substitutes the malleable notion ofJewish "difference" for the obsolete essentialism of an earlier time. Thus, Gilman does not argue for the untruth of pseudoscientific views of Jews as pathological or inferior, but rather exposes the shifting boundaries of these Aryan/Jewish oppositions that signal the subjectivity and contingency of their construction.5 In a chapter wittily demonstrating the arbitrariness of notions of Jewish physical inferiority, Gilman juxtaposes the pride with which the first modern practitioner of the "nose job," a German Jew, wore the facial dueling scars of his German fraternity with the anxiousness of hisJewish contemporaries to erase the marks of their Jewishness; that is, the doctor's scar rendered him as essentially German as his scarless rhino- plastic operations would render his Jewish clientele. While much of The Jew's Body is devoted to demonstrating the arbitrar- iness of antisemitic perceptions of Jewish difference, Gilman does see a [118] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="5">pattern emerging from the antisemitic obsession with the Jewish body. In the study of the Jewish hysteric and in the search for the identity of Jack the Ripper, to take two examples, the Jewish male is perceived not only as pathologically different and inferior, but also as specifically fem- inine in this difference. Gilman cites scientific studies that "prove" that hysteria is both a female disease and a disease ofJewish men. Moreover, writes Gilman, "it is evident from the visual representation of the cases of hysteria that there is a clear 'feminization' of the male Jew in the context of the occurence of hysteria."6 Gilman traces the image of the feminized Jewish male to antisemitic anxieties about the circumcised Jewish penis. At the end of the chapter on 'TheJewish Murderer," Gilman provides, in algebraic shorthand, his understanding of the reasoning that led the police and the public to guess thatJack the Ripper was aJew: Jews=lepers=syphilitic=prostitutes=blacks. This chain of assocation pres- ents the ultimate rationale for the Jewish Jack the Ripper .... Being unclean, being a version of the female genitalia (with their amputated genitalia), the male Jew is read (as Jack's Viennese contemporary Otto Weininger read him) as really nothing but a type of female. The pariah can thus touch and kill the pariah; the same destroy the same.7 In passages like this one, the cultural study of the body is pressed to interpret one of the most persistent conundrums ofJewish scholarship: the origin and nature of antisemitism. Gilman's exposure of Europe's shifting construction of Jewish stereotypes comes to rest here on the fulcrum of the circumcised penis of the male Jew. In this sign of racial difference, which was sometimes regarded as inherent to Jews (as in the report thatJewish babies were often born already circumcised), the antisemitic fantasy of Jewish difference could find a "real" proof of Jewish inferiority. By the same token, Gilman himself discovers a psy- chosexual etiology for EuropeanJew-hatred in the threat to masculinity implied by the male Jew's "mutilated" penis. Gilman's solution bears an obvious resemblance to Freud's view of women as representing the already-castrated to the young boy, although it is the Jewish male that takes the place of the "castrated" female in Gilman's scenario. But Gilman does not only borrow from Freud to understand European antisemitism, he also uses European antisemi- tism to understand Freud. In a chapter entitled "The Jewish Psyche," which he expanded and published as Freud, Race, and Gender (Princeton, 1993), Gilman argues that the maleJew represents the suppressed third term, between (uncircumcised) male and female, in Freud's analysis of gender differences. Freud's theory of gender, as Gilman sees it, in [119] Naomi Seidman Carnal Knowledge</page><page sequence="6">fact derives from this very suppression. Working in an atmosphere that viewed maleJews as incomplete men, not to say faulty vessels of scientific objectivity, Freud had much to gain from constructing a theory that universalized psychic phenomena, erasing racial distinctions in favor of cross-cultural truths. The racial universalism of Freud's theories, however, came at a price: an even more firmly-drawn line now separated women from men-all men, includingJews, now reassigned their right- ful place among males of all races. The Jewish scientist responds to the feminization of male Jews by reaffirming the essential and biological femininity of women, and only of women. The Jewish/Aryan tension, in Gilman's reading of Freud, is still perceptible, but is now submerged in Freud's resolute attention to sexual difference. Gilman's thesis, as he himself notes, places the male Jew (and cir- cumcision) at the very center of his analysis of both the origin of psychoanalysis and European antisemitism-the two are linked, of course, in his view: "While some women (and images of women) are present in the various investigations, the central figure throughout is that of the male Jew, the body with the circumcised penis-an image crucial to the very understanding of the Western image of the Jew at least since the advent of Christianity."8 But this holds true even for Gilman's readings of Freud's case studies, in whichJewish women were well-represented. Here, for example, in drastic summary, is Gilman's analysis of Freud's interpretation of one of Dora's [Ida Bauer] dreams. Dora dreams, at one point, that her mother wishes to rescue jewels from a fire that threatens her family. "Freud stresses that the 'jewels' become a 'jewelcase' in the dream," Gilman writes, "and that this term ['Schmuckkasten'] is a term commonly used to describe female genitals that are immaculate and intact."'9 The dream, then, hides Dora's ob- session with the syphilis her mother acquired from her father by switch- ing the diseased vagina for the clean and healthy jewelcase. But, as Gilman sees it, Freud's interpretation is itself a cover: "In Viennese urban dialect, borrowed from Yiddish, 'Schmock' . . . had come to be a standard slang term for the circumcised male penis." What Freud might not have wished to acknowledge in Dora's dream is the image of the male Jew hidden within the term for the vagina: 'The replace- ment of the 'Jewish' penis-identifiable as circumcised and, as we shall see, as diseased, by the 'German' vagina stands at the center of Freud's revision of the identity of Ida Bauer."10 Gilman views this as evidence for Freud's "misreading of the female for the male organ." Here, as elsewhere, Gilman constructs his argument with the familiar building blocks of his analysis of European antisemitism-the "hidden language" of the Jew, the analogy between the Jewish male and the [120] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="7">feminine, the connection between Jews and disease. Readers may find Gilman's insistent logic, while often persuasive, drawn from a peculiarly limited palette. For instance, despite Gilman's foregrounding of the place of antisemitism in the lives of Freud and his patients, it does not occur to him to take note of the literal level of Dora's dream, her mother's rescue of the family jewels. Alongside the "mutilated" penis, the jewel-bedecked Jewish woman was among the most potent of anti- semitic images, even if it functioned as a cover for psychosexual anti- semitic anxieties. Gilman's neglect of the economic dimension of antisemitism may simply be a function of his strict focus on its medical manifestations and psychosexual etiology. It is also possible, however, to read Gilman's work in the light of late-twentieth-century American aca- demic politics, just as Gilman reads Freud as reacting to early-twentieth- century Viennese scientific politics. From this perspective, Gilman's understanding of the antisemite as reacting to the primal wound of circumcision locates antisemitism in a now obsolete Jewish distinction, since many American males are now circumcised; fear of circumcised penises must now be universally acknowledged as a particularly irrational source ofJew-hatred. Economic stereotypes of Jews, however, continue unabated, and seem less patently absurd than Gilman's catalogue of antisemitic "medical" data. Moreover, "race," for all the poststructuralist exposures of its artificiality, has become a valorized category in the multicultural academy, and one from whichJews are generally excluded. Given the shifting tides of antisemitic perceptions, one can understand why an American Jewish academic might prefer to discuss the history of the racial stereotype of theJew rather than that of the economic stereo- type. The study of Jews and Judaism from the perspective of the body, for all its implied promise to expose the deepest layers of Jewish expe- rience, can also provide a route for circumventing certain of the more uncomfortable areas of this experience. Gilman's work has other ramifications in terms of contemporary academic politics: One effect of Gilman's claim thatJewish difference underlies Freudian sexual difference, for instance, is to place the male Jew where the woman (and femaleJew) had previously held sway. Thus, the "Schmuckkasten "actually turns out to be a "Schmock, "and the Jewish Ida Bauer somehow acquires a "German" vagina. The woman, in Gilman's reading, is divested of her economic identity, her sex, her religious affiliation, even her subconscious (it is Freud's misreading, not Dora's dreamwork, that matters); all of these revert to the male Jewish analyst/critic, whose anxieties, subjectivity and interpretive pow- ers are placed at center stage. Gilman's work on Freud, in general, reasserts the primacy of Jewish Studies in precisely those texts where [121] Naomi Seidman Carnal Knowledge</page><page sequence="8">feminist criticism previously held sway. Gilman's work owes much to feminist criticism, and is, in a sense, an outgrowth of it; nevertheless, TheJew's Body and Freud, Race, and Gender often stand in uneasy relation to feminism. On the one hand, Gilman affirms the importance of feminist criticism, never confusing the masculine and the universal. Moreover, his exposure of the instabilities and anxieties of (Jewish and non-Jewish) patriarchy and masculinity make his work as important to gender studies as to Jewish Studies. Nonetheless, Gilman's claim that the masculine definesJewish experience, for both antisemites andJews, seems as much a result of Gilman's own reluctance to pursue a psychol- ogy ofJewish femininity as a true reflection of the material. Even if the circumcised penis is indeed central to the Jewish and non-Jewish im- agination, would not aJewish woman, by her attachment to the "muti- lated" man, display a distinctive set of psychological characteristics not found in the German woman? Gilman's conflation of German and Jewish femininity also leaves the category of femininity unexplored, making it serve instead as a place-marker for the all-important third term of the Jewish male. This problematic aspect of Gilman's work reappears, it seems to me, in some of the other texts under discussion here, perhaps because of the nature of their shared project. These critics and historians, in forging new strategies for analyzing the canon (and in Gilman's case, the masculine center ofJewish life), are clearly searching for nonsexist approaches to patriarchal material while mov- ing away from the already established formulae of feminist criticism. Gilman's analysis of Jewish masculinity in antisemitic Europe, which views it less in terms of patriarchal power than as a subcategory of the feminine, disrupts some long-held feminist assumptions. The larger intellectual and political implications of such work as Gilman's are only beginning to come into focus. 2 In high school, my friends and I would pore through the Bible, the Mishna, whatever halakhic compendia we could get our hands on, ferreting out any references to sex. We mulled over Abishag, David's hot-water bottle, and the semen that emerged from Joseph's virtuous fingertips, but there was something about the combination of strict law and graphic detail in the halakhic material we found particularly fascinating: timetables to govern the frequency of sexual intercourse, tabulated by the husband's profession; arguments about nocturnal emission and Torah study. Young girls with little access to American [122] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="9">popular culture, we found our ars erotica and our religion in very much the same places. David Biale's Eros and theJews emerges from a hermeneutic impulse similar to our own, compiling sexual references in Jewish culture from the Bible to contemporary America, with chapters along the way on the Talmud, kabbalah, medieval culture and philosophy, Hasidism, the Enlightenment and Zionism. But Eros and theJews is not just a collation and paraphrase of sexual discussions-such an enterprise would no doubt be longer and more unwieldy (and perhaps more eccentric) than Biale's text. Neither is Eros and the Jews a psychosexual history of the Jews, explaining patriarchy, monotheism or Hasidism as a function of unconscious forces. As Biale describes it, his project is to see how Jews wrote about sex, and he takes his cues from these discourses themselves. For the most part, this means that Eros and theJews links sexuality with communal rather than individual concerns: If sex is the physical act that takes place between people, sexuality or eroticism is the way a culture imagines sex, the framework in which it places it, and the meanings it assigns it. Thus, I understand Eros to encompass the cultural and social constructs, such as love and marriage, that define and control sex to be part of our subject.11 Within these parameters, Biale's primary interpretive strategy is to militate against the view ofJudaism as monolithic, presenting each body of texts or social movement as a compromise formation between com- peting impulses. "The Bible," Biale writes, "is ... the record of a culture in conflict with its own identity, a conflict frequently represented by tensions between law and narrative and, just as often, by contradictions between different laws and different narratives."'2 Thus, biblical culture negotiated between the strictures of sexual law and the imperative of fertility,13 while talmudic culture emerged from the tensions between an asceticism inherited from surrounding cultures and the centrality of marriage to Jewish life. This pattern, in Biale's view, continues until our own times, with the biblical and talmudic tensions between sexual pleasure and procreation, repressiveness and liberation, remaining the poles between which Jewish texts and cultures find their expression. Given the highly charged debates surroundingJewish sexuality, it may be no surprise that Eros and theJews is shaped by a set of contradictions as profound as those Biale uncovers inJewish culture in general. Biale's interpretative strategy alternates between the most radical and libera- tory of gestures and a deeply conservative traditionalism, between the desire to break new ground and the impulse to defend and fortify the [123] Naomi Seidman 0 Carnal Knowledge</page><page sequence="10">old. In a provocative juxtaposition which both opens and closes the work, Biale sets the sexual dilemmas of Alexander Portnoy, the protag- onist of Philip Roth's novel, against the "sexual subversion" that runs through biblical culture: Portnoy's Complaint captures the dilemmas of modern Jewish life: Can the Jewish people perpetuate itself biologically in a culture that no longer links sex with procreation as had the old religious commandment that legitimated sexuality? CanJews achieve sexual satisfaction with otherJews, or will they, like Portnoy, turn to the mythical Gentile?14 In the next few sentences, Biale makes it clear that the history of these concerns can be traced to the Bible. As evidence, Biale begins his chapter on biblical culture not with the creation of Adam and Eve, an obvious site for an exploration of biblical views of sex and gender, but with the Book of Ruth, which, like the story of Lot's daughters or David's marriage to Bathsheba, is a narrative that seems to celebrate an over- throw of law and convention in the interest of procreation: The biblical concept of fertility demanded the suspensions of norms when it came to the birth of heroes. The crossing of boundaries, both sexual and ethnic, became a central component in the ideology of the monarchy as well as in the national ideology of the Israelite people. Ruth is doubly anti-normative: a woman who takes the sexual initiative in a patriarchal culture and a Moabite who becomes the ancestor of King David, despite legal bans on intermarriage.15 There is no mistaking the relish in Biale's analysis here. "Sexual subver- sion," he writes in a later passage, "hints at the unexpected character of God's covenant with Israel."'6 In a drastic reversal of the sanctioned rabbinical methods of smoothing away apparent unorthodoxies in the biblical text, Biale makes the sexual transgressions of biblical characters (and the text's seeming approval or at least acceptance of these trans- gressions) the very center of his analysis. Biale's discussion of the second central issue of Jewish sexuality also arises in his analysis of Portnoy's Complaint: "Does the Jewish tradition affirm or repress sexuality?"17 The answer turns out to be that it does both, but not, as sometimes is assumed, because the Bible demonstrates a repugnance toward the body in its purity laws. In Biale's reading, biblical impurity is a sign of a woman's inability to conceive, not of religious misogyny: 'The law did not regard a menstruating woman as any more repugnant than a man who had ejaculated: both had incurred cultic impurity by loss of their respective [124] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="11">seed."'8 The central conflict of the Bible was reconciling strict purity laws with the procreation imperative-and in a sense there was no real con- tradiction, since purity (and endogamous marriage) laws as well as the various transgressions of these laws ultimately served the cause of fertility. If the Jewish tradition developed ascetic traits, it was not from an adherence to biblical traditions, but through Jewish contact with Sto- icism and Hellenism. The rabbis responded to philosophies that den- igrated nonprocreative sex by both resisting and, to some degree, incorporating such attitudes: 'Their views of sexual pleasure were far less negative than those of writers like Philo, even though they shared with him, and with Greco-Roman culture in general, a concern for the overall problem of how to reconcile the sober duty of procreation with sexual passion."19 Passages like this one participate in what seems to be a growing movement to situate the hostility to sex outside Judaism, i.e. in foreign cultures, in sharp contrast to the earlier role traditionalJews assigned Hellenism as the purveyors of sexual and moral licence. The same impulse to overturn stereotypes that leads Biale to defend the Bible and Talmud from charges of hostility to sex, also leads him to challenge cherished notions about the liberatory nature of such movements as mysticism and Hasidism. In Biale's view, ecstatic kabbalah is "as hostile to sensuality as were the philosophers,"20 and Hasidism is an association "between sexual asceticism and erotic theology."2" And the myth of sexual liberation that accompanied the Zionist pioneering movement may have been just that. Biale's analysis is most wittily incisive when he turns the lens on contemporary Jewish sexual apologetics. Citing a pamphlet written in the mid-1960s by Norman Lamm, the president of Yeshiva University, Biale notes how Orthodoxy reshaped Jewish tradition in the interests of participating in American sexual culture: "By coopting one dimension of the sexual revolution into the ostensible Jewish view of marriage, [Lamm] asserts that the Jews be- lieved in sex without guilt long before the 1960s."22 In an epilogue entitled "Creating Desire," an illuminating self-exam- ination unusual among historians, Biale lays bare the political concerns that underlie his work. Biale's position, as he sees it, itself negotiates between respect for sexuality and an equally strong interest in Jewish continuity- both physical and spiritual. Biale's own vision for the resolution of these two poles is expressed in the somewhat startling hope that his work will contribute to the creation of erotic images of Jews and Judaism: The future of the Jews as a people clearly depends on the ability ofJewish culture to imagine otherJews as erotic.... The challenge in a posttraditio- [125] Naomi Seidman Carnal Knowledge</page><page sequence="12">nal world is to divest the binary opposition between Jew and Gentile of its theological baggage and, thereby, to temper its elements of fantasy and projection. Only when erotic relations between Jews and non-Jews appear less momentous and threatening will they lose part of their fascination.23 Read retrospectively from his epilogue, Biale'sjuxtaposition of Portnoy and Ruth as well as his defense of the rabbis' healthy sexual attitudes are revealed as savvy moves in a contemporary American-Jewish dia- logue. The sexual transgressions and even intermarriage in the Book of Ruth are to be celebrated not only for their role in the founding of the Davidic dynasty, but also because they contribute to an erotic Judaism-one which may persuade Jews to marry inside their own faith! What appeared at first to be Biale's subversive use of Alexander Portnoy to disrupt our pious assumptions about the Bible ultimately becomes a means for using the Bible to put Portnoy in his proper place: that is, in the long and stately procession ofJewish history. (One wonders what a different book this would have been had Biale juxtaposed Allen Ginsberg's "Howl," say, with David's lament over the fallen Jonathan.) Biale's traditionalism no doubt derives in large part from the concerns he expresses about Jewish continuity, but some of the traditionalist implications of his work seem to emerge from the very project of writing a narrative that takes us "from biblical Israel to contemporary America." In this regard, Eros and the Jews demonstrates the profoundly conserva- tive and recuperative nature of historiography, even when it acknowl- edges the heterogeneity of its material, and even when it takes on such a potentially explosive theme. 3 Among the more visible results of the academic turn to the body in the mid-1980s was the series of lavishly illustrated and produced critical anthologies published under the Zone rubric and subtitled Fragments toward a History of the Body. Whether or not the Zone books lived up to their promise of a revolutionary approach to the humanities, they certainly represented a revolution in academic publishing. As import- ant as its prestigious contributors, the glossy format seemed to imply, were the colorful covers, the fine texture of high-grade paper, the sophisticated typefaces. Reading, the books reminded us, is as much a physical and tactile experience as an intellectual one. After decades of insisting on the book as "text," readers were now being enjoined to regard the text as book. [126] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="13">But the second, more salient, characteristic of the series was its penchant for disrupting disciplinary borders, canonical hierarchies, the principles of good taste. The tables of content demonstrated an edito- rial relish for odd juxtaposition and disjointed chronology. In a glee- fully democratic levelling of the academic playing field, Mayan transvestites rubbed shoulders with Victorian neurologists. Among the immediate benefits of providing a home for such disparate bedfellows was that critics and historians were compelled to present their material even as they explicated it. If a critic could no longer count on the ear of a small circle of fellow Serbo-Croation scholars, say, she would have to earn the attention of Zone's potentially larger audience. By organ- izing anthologies around the universal category of the body rather than by national culture or academic field, this new trend had the potential for shaking entire disciplines out of the complacent incestuousness of their traditional insider-talk. The value of this cross-cultural turn to the body, that is, lay precisely in its interdisciplinarity. The potential benefit of the turn to the body may be just as great, however, for Jewish Studies, even if one leaves its disciplinary bound- aries intact. The mildest gesture of brushingJewish sources against the idealist grain reveals abundant material on sexual and bodily experi- ence. As Howard Eilberg- Schwartz's introduction to People of the Body explains, one purpose of resisting an "excessively disembodied image of the Jews" is to enable "alternate ways of thinking aboutJudaism and describing Jewish experience."24 The promise implicit in Eilberg-Schwartz's introduction, however, is only partially fulfilled in the critical essays that follow. Whatever their gestures toward addressing 'Jews and Judaism from an embodied per- spective," the essays either fit easily into the traditional center ofJewish Studies-the polemics surrounding anthropomorphism and circumci- sion, "the image of the Jew" in antisemitism-or are developments of feminist arguments explored in previous work-theJAP stereotype, the place of menstruation in religious life and thought. Among the stronger essays are a few that appear in the full-length works under review here, with Daniel Boyarin's tour-de-force study of the grotesque body in the Talmud the most unusual and provocative. This is not to say that the essays are not valuable contributions to their respective fields, only that the whole of the project is not much more than the sum of its parts. This weakness is partly attributable to the critics' failure, with very few exceptions, to speak beyond the narrow limits of their subfields. One of the exceptions is NaomiJanowitz's chapter on the Shiur Komah literature, which makes especially good use of the opportunity of presenting her material to readers who may be unfamiliar with it. Janowitz, proving that [127] Naomi Seidman Carnal Knowledge</page><page sequence="14">description can be a powerful tool of illumination, brings to vivid life the literary speculations on the dimensions of God's body. In citing a passage from the Shiur Komah that has the entire universe hanging like an amulet from an incredibly enormous God's arm, Janowitz writes: "In one devastating move, earlier cosmological traditions have been shrunk down to pocket size."25 In other passages, she notes that many Greco- Roman deities were described as huge, "many sounding like incredible hulks bursting out of their previous, much smaller clothing."26 And stirring the reader to imaginative empathy, Janowitz wonders aloud 'whether a gigantic body is reassuring or terrifying."27 Elliot Wolfson's chapter, by contrast, promisingly entitled "Images of God's Feet," may be of vastly more interest to his closest colleagues, but it approaches its subject through a dense web of scholarship guar- anteed to quell any actual images the citations might evoke-this in spite of the fact that Wolfson's argument is that references to God's feet are not to be taken as metaphorical or allegorical. Even when he adopts a relatively psychological approach, Wolfson allows his startlingly potent material to congeal into the opaquely familiar building blocks of kabbalistic discourse: The feet of God [in the Zohar] thus represent the masculine potency, identified further as the speculum that shines, which is united with the feminine Shekhinah, whose desire to receive the influx from the masculine is here depicted by the image of Righteousness calling out to the feet in a continuous manner.8 Janowitz's and Wolfson's articles, along with that of Eilberg-Schwartz, belong to the group of essays in People of the Body on the age-old question of divine anthropomorphism, whose pendulum has apparently now swung to the point that scholars are only too willing to suppose that God was imagined as a corporeal being. Wolfson clarifies the confusion surrounding this concept by distinguishing between metaphorical and mythical thinking-in many Jewish texts, God's embodiment is an example of the latter. Eilberg-Schwartz's discussion of Adam's creation "in God's image" also touches upon the question of anthropomor- phism, concluding that the equivalence between God's body and the human or masculine form is left deliberately ambiguous.29 In these and other essays, the potentially exciting question "Does God have a body?" quickly yields to familiar forms of discursive analysis: semantic distinc- tions, textual ambiguity, P. vs. J., etc. We are reminded that what we are dealing with, after all, is no more than words on paper-the Book, in other words. [128] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="15">In some essays, especially those of feminist critics, the shift in focus implied by the collection's title required no more than the gentlest reworking of ideas already expressed elsewhere: Chava Weissler's anal- ysis of attitudes toward menstruation in the musar literature and in the tkhines, demonstrating the effects of different bodily experiences on religious creativity, certainly adds something to her important work on the tkhines, but little that could be called startling.30 By the same token, Riv- Ellen Prell's discussion of "Why Jewish Princesses Don't Sweat" provides another, corporeal dimension to earlier analyses of the eco- nomic bases of the JAP stereotype, but does not overturn or challenge the earlier arguments on the subject.31 One suspects that none of these writers had to stretch very far to have their work included under the rubric of body studies. For the turn to the body to have a truly trans- formative effect on Jewish Studies, scholars will have to work harder to defamiliarize the field, reaching out to a larger audience, looking for new material at the edges of the canon, formulating new and more imaginative questions. Most of all, this scholarship would have to resist the reduction of Jewish bodily experience to a limited number of concerns and relinquish a banal pseudo-Freudianism that sees sex as the only important aspect of corporeality. On one hand, to speak about the body in Judaism is to presume to tell a narrative with the widest implications-after all, the borders of bodily experience are coexten- sive with the human experience in general. On the other hand, it is a far more specific concern than the familiar critical sites would indicate: the Bible's distinctive anatomical vision has yet to be fully charted (with the telling exception of Wolfson's analysis of the feet as a euphemism for the genitals), to take an obvious example, nor have we come to terms with the Holocaust in the history of the Jewish body. Or one can imagine a volume that more closely emulated the Zone approach, abandoning a "from Genesis to Woody Allen" chronology in favor of juxtaposing a study of the development of nail-cutting practices among Transylvanian Jews, for example, with the significance of Elisha's bald spot. There is no doubt that Jewish Studies could use an airing-out; it is also becoming apparent that this job is more easily promised than accomplished. 4 In the mid-1960s, after Vatican II officially exonerated the Jews for the crime of Christ's crucifixion, a bumper sticker appeared on New York City cars proclaiming, "We did so do it." Something of this spirit ani- [129] Naomi Seidman Carnal Knowledge</page><page sequence="16">mates Daniel Boyarin's Carnal Israel: Reading Sex in Talmudic Culture. Boyarin begins his discussion of Jewish "carnality" with a quote from Augustine proclaiming the Jews irredeemably linked to the flesh. In what is surely an unusual move for a Jewish scholar, Boyarin whole- heartedly asserts the descriptive accuracy of this Christian view ofJews: "Augustine knew what he was talking about. There was a difference between Jews and Christians that had to do with the body."32 In a formulation similar to Biale's, Boyarin argues that the mainstream of rabbinical culture needs to be distinguished from the first-century Hellenized Judaism (emblematized by Philo) from which Paul and Christianity emerged; it is through this Greek-speaking culture that Stoic attitudes toward sexuality and the body were transmitted to Jews. But while Biale claims that the rabbis both were influenced by and resisted Stoic asceticism, Boyarin insists that even the Palestinian school, which demonstrates a greater affinity for Stoic attitudes than the Babylonian school, approaches, "but does not merge with" the sexual ideology of Hellenistic Judaism. While Biale's project is to ascribe the apparent sexual asceticism of certain rabbis to external influences, Boyarin is more interested in arguing for a basic and unbridgeable distinction between talmudic and Hellenistic cultures, whatever the superficial similarities. Boyarin's thesis is that rabbinicJudaism invested significance in the body which in [Greek-speak- ing Jewish formations, including Christianity] was invested in the soul. That is, for rabbinic Jews, the human being was defined as a body-ani- mated, to be sure, by a soul-while for Hellenistic Jews (such as Philo) and (at least many Greek-speaking) Christians (such as Paul), the essence of a human being is a soul housed in a body.34 The most important ramification of these differences, for Boyarin, is that the rabbis were free of the misogyny that traditionally accompanied asceticism or a devaluation of the body. But a problem emerges if one makes this clear distinction between rabbinical and Hellenistic-Chris- tian attitudes toward sex-how can the inequitable gender politics of talmudic practice and discourse be understood without recourse to the concept of misogyny? This question could not be more crucial in Boyarin's work, for a number of reasons: Carnal Israel addresses an audience clearly intended to include readers outside Jewish Studies. The lucid introductory remarks on the nature and history of the Tal- mud, the selection of lively texts guaranteed to excite the reader's attention, the responses to debates in Christian studies, the familiarity and engagement with contemporary trends in cultural theory all attest [130] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="17">to this ambition. At the same time, Boyarin's deep affiliations with both feminism and traditional Judaism combine in a far stronger and more complex challenge to the Talmud than Augustine's critique, which Boyarin is perfectly happy to accept and transvalue. Carnal Israel navigates some of these pitfalls by acknowledging that rabbinical culture's laudable approach to the body must not be con- strued as saving them from patriarchy-to the contrary: [A] culture adopting the ideological position that sexuality is a benefit given by God to humans, both for procreative and for other positive ends, acquired problems as well as solutions. Indeed, I am arguing that there was much social conflict with the societies which rabbinic Judaism helped form, precisely owing to the strength of this position, for the insistence on embodiment and sexuality as the foundational primitives of human essence almost ineluctably produce gender and sex-role differentiation as dominant characteristics of the social formation. Some Christians (whether Jewish or Gentile) could declare that there is no Greek or Jew, no male or female. No rabbi could do so, because people are bodies, not spirits, and precisely bodies are marked as male or female, and also marked, through bodily practices and techniques such as circumcision and food taboos, as Jew or Greek as well.35 There is something depressing about this logic. Readers may easily enough agree that the rabbis' acceptance of sexuality, combined with the particularist nature ofJewish physical and genealogical difference- as opposed to Christian disembodiment and "universalism"-are posi- tive characteristics of talmudic culture. But having come this far, the reader is suddenly in the position of understanding the "gender and sex-role differentiation of rabbinical culture" as the price of a sexually open ideology! The medicine works fine, as they say, but the side-effects can kill you. As it turns out, Boyarin hopes and believes that the rabbinic acceptance of the body can be combined with gender equality, a stance that necessitates a careful hermeneutic approach to the Tal- mud. On the one hand, Boyarin explains, defends and even cele- brates rabbinic "carnality." On the other, he responds to the most immediately noticeable aspect of rabbinic patriarchy, the exclusion of women from Torah study, by carefully separating the two phe- nomena: the exclusion of women, by his logic, cannot be understood by rabbinic misogynism. Thus, Carnal Israel champions rabbinic no- tions of sexuality while carefully distinguishing these notions from their homosocial discursive practice. [131] Naomi Seidman Carnal Knowledge</page><page sequence="18">One of the clearest examples of this approach is Boyarin's ingenious (but partial, as I will argue) interpretation of the curious Talmud story about the disciple who hides under his teacher's bed to study his lovemaking technique (a story that has interesting developments in the Hasidic folktale). Boyarin presents this story as one of a series of passages he sees as depicting the talmudic encouragement of marital intimacy and affection: Rav Kahana entered and lay down beneath the bed of Rav. He heard that he was talking and laughing and having sexual intercourse. He said, 'The mouth of [Rav] appears as if he had never tasted this dish.' [Rav] said to him, 'Kahana, get out; this is not proper behavior!' [Kahana] said to him, 'It is Torah, and I must learn it.'36 In another version of the story from Hagiga 5b, only Rav's sexual play is recounted, in the context of a narrative that argues that a man may indulge in "superfluous" speech when he is arousing his wife to inter- course. Kahana's final line is omitted in this version, which Boyarin interprets as an implicit rejection of Kahana's diligence/voyeurism. In Boyarin's reading of these two texts, the Talmud considers and then rejects the notion of the "panopticon," a Foucauldian term for "the surveillance of private sexual behavior on the part of a culture."37 While rejecting what it ultimately sees as an unconscionable invasion of mar- ital privacy, however, the Talmud manages to get across the notion "that it is possible to derive pleasure from ... conversing with [one's wife], laughing and playing while making love."3 In Boyarin's view, this talmudic strategy illustrates Foucault's point that power/knowledge "penetrates and controls everyday pleasure" in ways that not only restrict but also effect "incitement and intensification."39 Despite and by way of its resistance to sexual control and surveillance, the Talmud manages to teach its readers something about marital intimacy and pleasure, demonstrating an "enormous respect for women's rights to physical well-being."40 In Boyarin's powerful and paradoxical reading, the talmudic story exposes rabbinic sex-practices for our edification (and perhaps titilla- tion as well), while resisting the invasion of marital intimacy. But while Boyarin's interpretation remains fixed at the site of the rabbinic bed- room, it is also possible to read this story as describing two scenes of interaction simultaneously-the bedroom and the classroom-which turn out to be the very same place. What the Talmud recounts is a quasi-sexual, quasi-pedagogical encounter between two men, one under and one on the bed-it is Kahana himself, after all, who says "It is Torah, [132] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="19">and I must learn it." And while Rav's wife is only an implied presence (a "dish") with no voice in this scene, Kahana's lively interest is directed to his teacher's lips, another sexual-pedagogical site. The argument between Kahana and Rav in Rav's bedroom functions as a parodic mirror of the most normative of talmudic practices, in which rabbis participate in an all-male colloquy about (in this case literally around) the female body. Kahana's "intrusion" is no more than a comically literalist translation of discursive practice into graphically sexual terms, a reconversion of Torah into sex and sex into Torah. What I am suggesting is that we need to look not only at what the rabbis had to say about sex and women, but how and to whom they made these observations. It is no coincidence, I think, that Boyarin does not examine the exclusion of women from Torah study within the context of the rab- binical view of sex, choosing instead to treat the issues as distinct. It is important to Boyarin's argument to separate what he views as positive in talmudic culture, i.e. a wholesome respect for physical experience, from what he agrees are its regrettable patriarchal elements-regretta- ble, but also amenable to change, in ways already implicit within the multiple voices of the Talmud. Boyarin gestures toward a psychosexual reading of rabbinic patriarchy in his last chapter, which examines rabbinic anxieties about the difficulties of fatherhood and pedagogical transmission, but he never takes the step of connecting this chapter to his earlier discussion of rabbinic attitudes about procreation. How then does Boyarin interpret the virtually complete exclusion of women from Torah study? Rejecting the notion that women were excluded from study circles because they were perceived as ritually impure, Boyarin instead explains this exclusion as a function of the rabbinic valuation of reproduction and the body: On my hypothesis, the main motivating force for the confinement of women to the sexual and procreative role in rabbinic culture was fear that were they not so confined, that vitally important role would not be ful- filled-that what concerned rabbis was not so much the contamination by a fearful and defiling force as much as the loss of control of a very valued 41 resource. I, for one, have no difficulty relinquishing the proposition that the rabbis confined women "to the sexual and procreative role" because of their psychosexual or ideological misogyny. Boyarin's argument would be more satisfying, however, if he offered a stronger explanation for the stubbornness of rabbinic sexual-segregation. After all, the rabbis [133] Naomi Seidman Carnal Knowledge</page><page sequence="20">not only inherited a male-dominant religious system, they also shaped a distinctive patriarchal system of their own. To say, as Boyarin does, that the rabbis saw "the Torah and the wife ... as both normatively to be highly valued but also to be kept separate,"42 does little to explain how and why the rabbis attained the enviable position of determining the relative values of Torah and women. I do not mean to imply that Boyarin at all ignores or makes light of the patriarchal elements of talmudic culture-far from it. He repeatedly acknowledges the condescension of the rabbis, their patronizing be- nevolence toward women's sexual well-being, even, at one point, calling a minority opinion that seems to equate women with meat or fish "simply appalling."43 But while Boyarin has no problem condemning what he views as talmudic sexism or calling for an active challenge to the rabbinic exclusion of women from Torah study, he rarely turns his considerable analytic skills to the phenomenon of homosocial or ex- clusionary discourse. Where explanations of rabbinic patriarchy are tendered, they are far less illuminating than Boyarin's analyses of other aspects of rabbinical culture. Boyarin's openly declared agenda is not only to embrace the body-centered aspects of talmudic culture, but also to overturn its exclusion of women by using its own marginal and suppressed voices to pry open the cracks in its discourse. If our rabbinic heritage is indeed to be sexually desegregated, we will need a somewhat fuller intelligence report from behind the lines than Carnal Israel man- ages to provide. 5 Characteristic of the texts reviewed here, and perhaps of this newly forming field of body studies in general, is a propensity for clever and provocative titles. As with his 1990 work The Savage inJudaism, however, Howard Eilberg-Schwartz's God's Phallus seems designed to provoke not only curiosity, but also resistance and possibly hostility as well. But it is precisely this resistance that lies at the very heart of Eilberg-Schwartz's project. The notion that Jews worship a disembodied God is a deeply cherished belief, dating at least as far back as theJewish encounter with Hellenist culture and continuing virtually undiminished to our own day. And Eilberg-Schwartz uncovers yet another resistance, not so much to the idea of God's body (or more provocatively, His genitals) as to their exposure to the human gaze. It is this resistance, Eilberg-Schwartz hypothesizes, that underlies and is partially responsible for the notion of a disembodied God: before the awesome and terrifying divine body, [134] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="21">mortals must avert both their eyes and thoughts. The very possibility of God's embodiedness, Eilberg-Schwartz argues, created both a sexual curiosity and the appropriate taboos to divert this avenue of thought, including the taboo against iconography that can be credited with encouraging the (false) belief that the Israelites worshipped a God who had no corporeal form. God's Phallus takes a stunningly new approach to the concept of anthropomorphism, the discussion of which (including Eilberg- Schwartz's own essay) did little to enliven People of the Body. Going beyond an analysis of divine embodiment as a theoretical or doctrinal concept, Eilberg-Schwartz explores the psychosexual ramifications of anthropomorphism for biblical culture. The divine body, as he sees it, has been the focus not only of inquiries into the nature and powers of God, but also of sexual speculations and projections. By arguing for the intimate connection between God's body and Jewish bodily expe- rience, God's Phallus persuasively brings together the two dimensions- divine and human-of embodiment that People of the Body relegated to separate studies. In his article on the creation of the first human being in People of the Body, Eilberg-Schwartz distinguished two separate problems in imagin- ing the correlation of God's form and human bodies: If God is viewed as possessing genitals, the question arises of what sort of sexual nature might animate a divine being who has no consort. If God, on the other hand, were devoid of sexual organs, then human sexuality would lack divine correspondence and legitimation. God's Phallus revitalizes what would appear to be a rather dull theological speculation on whether divine-human correspondences outweigh the discrepancies between God and mortals by recognizing the resonances of this problem in the human sphere: specifically, between father and sons. The relationship between a male God and mortal men, like the relationship between a father and his son, is a complex balance of symmetry and asymmetry, identity and difference. As Eilberg-Schwartz points out, feminist critics tend to stress the first half of this relationship, the fact that both God and men share the privileged trait of masculinity (Eilberg-Schwartz dismisses, I think rightly, the notion that the biblical God is "beyond" gender). His own project, by contrast, shifts the focus to the inequalities and tensions that necessarily adhere to the relationship between an omnipotent masculine figure and the mortals who bear his likeness while remaining subject to his awesome power. Eilberg-Schwartz's primary tools for examining the power dynamics that govern this relationship are derived from Freud, whose theory of childhood development relies on a rec- [135] Naomi Seidman Carnal Knowledge</page><page sequence="22">ognition of the child's feelings of powerlessness vis-a-vis a father with whom he is in dangerous competition. In support of his hypothesis, Eilberg-Schwartz quotes Freud on the significance of the shift from polytheism to monotheism: "Now that God was a single person, man's relation to him could recover the intimacy and intensity of the child's relation to his father."44 As this citation from The Future of an Illusion demonstrates, Freud both directly noted the connection between religious feelings and parent-child relations, and provided the tools for dissecting this con- nection in various places-perhaps most explicitly in his analysis of Dr. Schreber's homosexual/religious fantasies. But, as Eilberg-Schwartz notes, Freud never subjected Jewish monotheism to a systematic psy- chosexual analysis, and avoided all discussion of the connections be- tween monotheism and a son's homosexual longings for his father in his primary work on the Jewish Bible, Moses and Monotheism. From the evidence, Freud participated in reading the Bible as testimony to the "advanced" Jewish view of a God who had no body, a belief that distin- guished Judaism and was its spiritual and philosophical cornerstone. That is, Freud moves from a discussion of polytheistic or totemic reli- gions to an analysis of the spiritualized monotheism he sees in the Bible, proof of the Jewish renunciation of instinctual gratification. Strangely absent in Freud's critique of religion is the specific form of monotheism that Eilberg-Schwartz sees as the logical link between totemism and abstract deism-the worship of a single embodied Father God. If it is true that the Jews did imagine their God in human form (while refrain- ing from explicitly representing this form), and there is ample evidence that they did, then why, Eilberg-Schwartz asks, did Freud fail to notice or analyze this fact in his various writings on religion? In a tactic similar to Gilman's reading ofJewish difference behind Freud's view of sexual difference (and feminist readings of Freud's omissions and "repres- sions" before that), Eilberg-Schwartz wrests the Freudian basis for his research from the very silences and gaps in Freud on the subject of monotheism and homosexuality. The "missing link" of Freud's theory of religion is no accident, Eilberg- Schwartz argues, but rather a signif- icant symptom of Freud's own psychic difficulties. As evidence, Eilberg- Schwartz leads the reader from a dream of Freud's on the night of his father's funeral, through a train trip with Ferenczi and Schreber's fantasies about God turning him into a woman, to Freud's failure to note the position of Moses' left hand (suspiciously near his groin) in a Michelangelo sculpture he otherwise carefully explicates. However unlikely it may seem, this rather dizzying excursion can be more or less summarized in one sentence: Freud unconsciously repressed the pos- [136] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="23">sibility of an embodied biblical God because he himself had unresolved homosexual desires (of the "passive" variety) toward his father. Freud's repression, of course, is one individual expression of the larger Jewish intellectual as well as psychosexual repression of the half-intuited vision of God's body. Having simultaneously both established a Freudian basis for his arguments and cleared the way for his own variety of Freudianism, Eilberg-Schwartz proceeds to piece together evidence for his view of a monotheism generated by and productive of homoerotic desire. Cen- tral to his argument is the notion of God's body as hidden or veiled rather than nonexistent or metaphorical. In Eilberg-Schwartz's view, God's concealment is a symptom of a religious culture with contradic- tory and even paradoxical impulses: on the one hand, the fantasm of the solitary God invites (and is presumably produced by) the filial/ho- moerotic devotion of his children. As evidence that sexual relations between divine and mortal creatures would not have been inconceiv- able to a biblical Jew, Eilberg-Schwartz notes the prevalence of such events in Canaanite and other Near-Eastern poetry, the curious alli- ances between "the sons of God" and "the daughters of men" in Genesis 6: 1-4, the apparently homosexual interest of the men of Sodom in the angels of God, and the more sanctioned but nevertheless suggestive expressions of religious devotion in Psalms 63: 2-9: "My body yearns for You ... I sing praises with joyful lips, when I call You to mind upon my bed," and a host of other persuasive (if less than completely con- clusive) examples. On the other hand, equally basic principles of the biblical religion ruled out both the fulfillment of the homoerotic desires implicit in the man-God relationship and the very apprehension of these desires. Biblical monotheism, after all, rested not only on the worship of a single God, but also on patriarchy-the symmetry of divine and human mas- culinity-and normative heterosexuality; the biblical God was tied to the all-important function of procreation, intimately participating in opening women's wombs and ensuring the survival of Israel. Thus, the homoerotic connection between Jewish men and God could find no easy conceptual place in biblical culture. As Eilberg-Schwartz sees it, the Bible worked out two separate and somewhat contradictory solu- tions for this dilemma: the first of these was to hide God's body, averting recognition of the homoerotic potential of the religious feeling of a Jew for his God (men being the primary religious actors in biblical culture). Eilberg-Schwartz finds evidence for the association of the male gaze and a prohibited father-son homoeroticism in the story of Ham and Noah, in which "the prohibition against a son seeing his father's [137] Naomi Seidman Carnal Knowledge</page><page sequence="24">nakedness symbolically expresses and thereby institutionalizes hetero- sexual desire as a norm" (Eilberg-Schwartz reminds us of the function of the Noah narrative as a "second creation story).45 The second solu- tion to the dilemma of a heterosexual culture with a homosexual man-God foundation was to feminize Jewish men and the Jewish col- lective, thus bringing the relationship between God and the Jewish people into normative heterosexual form and allowing its erotic poten- tial to blossom. The diversionary tactics by which the Bible renders the homosexu- ality of its monotheism invisible or harmless correspond, in Eilberg- Schwartz's view, to those by which a son works through his erotic desires and fears toward a father whose castrating powers are ever-present. Eilberg-Schwartz reminds us, in this context, thatJacob only became Israel after a struggle with a divine being in which he receives a wound to his thigh, which, as some interpreters argue, may be a euphemistic reference to his groin or genitals. Just as the Oedipally-conflicted son may accept a symbolic castration and feminization in the hopes of winning affections, the founder of the Jewish people must undergo genital mutilation in order to enter into a full relation with the paternal deity. As Eilberg-Schwartz writes: Jacob only became Israel through an act of partial emasculation. Or to put it another way, the entity "Israel" only came into being through an act of partial emasculation. The story ofJacob's wrestling match thus contains within it an inchoate representation of Israel, the collective entity who is to be imagined as God's wife.46 For the most part, Eilberg-Schwartz's exploration of biblical mono- theism begins with the assumption of both theJewish worship of a single God and patriarchy as established historical facts, leaving the origins of these phenomena outside his study. But he does, at times, take the opportunity to analyze how the logic of a male-dominant Oedipal monotheism reinforced, if it did not produce, the exclusion of women from the religious sphere. As Eilberg-Schwartz sees it, the maleness of God both established male authority and threatened to render men redundant, since the heterosexual norm potentially paired a male God with female mortals. In a powerful and political (as opposed to the usual anthropological) reading of the ritual impurity of women in biblical culture, Eilberg-Schwartz writes: The religious system of ancient Israel dealt with this dilemma of men's potential exclusion and partial redundancy by shifting it onto women. The [138] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="25">insistence on female impurity excluded women from competition with men for divine affections. Women's impurity, in other words, arose in part from attempts to shore up men's access to the sacred. If the conventional theory explains women's cultic impurity as a result of her otherness from God, we can also see it as motivated in part by her natural complementarity to a male deity and her symbolic threat to men's place in the religious system. Women's otherness from God is precisely what made them his expected partners. They had to be excluded from the cult because they challenged the male connection with God.47 Eilberg-Schwartz's argument has a great deal of internal consistency, but there is something hard to grasp at its very center. Even if we accept his claim that the Jews believed in an embodied God, we still must wonder whether this belief was more conceptual than tangible. Did Jews indeed imagine that sexual contact with the divine was a concrete possibility? What does it mean to speak of "homosexuality" in the absence of sexual acts? (Foucault, we may recall, argued that "homo- sexuality" as a "sexual inclination" rather than as a specific act is a relatively recent cultural construction.)48 If the Bible could so easily metaphorize the Jewish people as God's wife, could it not have viewed God the husband as similarly figurative? God's Phallus sometimes seems to approach these traditional readings of God's body as metaphorical ("The Torah speaks in human language"), but at other times speaks as if God's body was and is a tangible entity. In one startling passage near the beginning of the book, Eilberg-Schwartz writes that from accounts of "God sightings," we have no information about God's anatomy: "Not only is there no indication that this God has a penis, but we do not even know whether this being has secondary sexual characteristics such as facial hair."49 Eilberg-Schwartz gives little sense of the specific phe- nomenology of "seeing" or "knowing" a body that is, presumably, often invisible. It is possible, after all, that the concealment of God's body enjoined by the Bible can be attributed in part to the fact that people could not or did not-with only the rarest of exceptions-actually see this body. Beginning artists know the trick of hiding their subjects' feet until they can draw them convincingly-might there be some of this sleight-of-hand at work in the Bible's vagueness about the exact con- tours of the divine form? There may be a more serious flaw in the argument presented in God's Phallus. Eilberg-Schwartz's project begins by elucidating the gap in Freud's study of the development of monotheism. But God's Phallus, it seems to me, is similarly structured around a crucial elision: Eilberg- Schwartz reimagines Judaism according to an Oedipal model without [139] Naomi Seidman 0 Carnal Knowledge</page><page sequence="26">taking account of the mother, even as a disappeared or absent member of the Oedipal triangle. My intention is not to bring matriarchy or goddesses into the discussion here, but rather to note that the rivalry of son and father, and the threat of castration that attends this rivalry, is about the father-son competition for the affections and body of the mother. Rivalry and the threat of castration are important elements in Eilberg-Schwartz's argument, and indeed he explores the competition between son and daughter, as it were, for God's love-for example in the above discussion ofJewish women's impurity as a means of excluding her from the religious sphere. But if we construct the relationship between the Jewish male and God as part of a family romance, then how do we account for the absence of the mother? And even if one leaves that question outside the purview of the present discussion, how is it possible to make use of the Oedipal narrative when such a crucial element has been withdrawn? In this way, Eilberg-Schwartz's project has more in common with Harold Bloom's theory of the "anxiety of influ- ence" than it does with Freud. Like Bloom, Eilberg-Schwartz constructs a Freudian tale of father-son rivalry as if the displacement or evaporation of the maternal function made not the slightest difference.50 Nevertheless, it seems to me that God's Phallus is the one truly important work to emerge in the context ofJewish "body studies," and one of the most original works in Jewish Studies to be published in recent years. Eilberg-Schwartz's reinterpretation ofJudaism as an "Oe- dipal" religious civilization (to deliberately mangle Mordechai Kaplan's formulation) provides a radically new approach to the Bible as a whole, while elegantly explicating some of its most recalcitrant passages. The basic insight that propels God's Phallus turns out to be, in reading after reading, astonishingly fruitful. But Eilberg-Schwartz may have under- mined the reception of what is, after all, a serious and well-documented argument by his own mischievousness. Given his claim that the Jews worshipped a God whose body was concealed, and his reminders of the dire consequences that befall those who transgress the taboo against exposing the father's nakedness, there is something slightly perverse about Eilberg-Schwartz's brazen lifting of the divine/paternal robes, in the title of his study, to peek underneath. One can only hope that he, unlike Ham, will get away with it. 6 The Doppler effect, we may recall, measures whether stars are ap- proaching or moving away from us, manifesting temporal delay as a [140] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="27">shift in hue along the color spectrum. Having noted the belated ap- pearance of Jewish studies of the body, can we say that these studies also come in distinctive colors, taking their place in specific regions of the academic spectrum? That is, do these books have something in common other than their attention to sex and the body? One rather surprising characteristic shared by at least three of the works discussed here is an openly acknowledged sense of political purpose, expressed in all three cases by unusually direct, almost confessional epilogues. Eros and theJews, Carnal Israel and God's Phallus end with direct addresses to the reader; it may be no coincidence that The Jew's Body, the work that primarily deals with non-Jewish images and discourse aboutJews, rather than with Jewish sources, avoids anything that resembles a man- ifesto. Let me quickly summarize these epilogues, two of which have already been mentioned: Biale, in a chapter called "Creating Desire," traces the relevance of his work to what he sees as the vexing issue of inter- marriage. His tentative hope for Eros and the Jews (more boldly put forth in the title of the epilogue) is that "this book may take its place as one more text seeking to understand, define, and perhaps even contribute to creating Jewish desire."51 Boyarin, in a rather lengthier epilogue entitled "Concluding For- ward: Talmudic Study as Cultural Critique," seems to have a similarly ambitious though somewhat more complex agenda for his study of talmudic culture. Referring approvingly once again to the rabbinic rejection of a mind-body split, Boyarin asks how we can avoid the resulting gender ideologies, which kept both men and women rooted in what was seen as their biologically ordained roles. By reminding us that talmudic culture was not monolithic and easily encompassed dis- senting voices, Boyarin proposes that "[t]hose perhaps marginal men and women can become for us prototypes in a reformation of tradi- tionalJewish gender practices that nevertheless finds itself rooted firmly in the talmudic text and tradition."52 Eilberg-Schwartz's conclusion, entitled "Embracing Our Fathers: Theological Musings of a Son," strikes me as the strangest epilogue of the three. Acknowledging the feminist critique of a deified masculinity, Eilberg-Schwartz suggests that it is nevertheless possible to rescue or reclaim loving fatherly images of God (alongside powerful female im- ages). This fatherly God would have to be very different from the distant and authoritarian images we now have, which Eilberg-Schwartz sees as contributing to homophobia: "Embracing the Father involves a willing- ness to see male-male eroticism as an emotionally whole relationship."53 [141] Naomi Seidman Carnal Knowledge</page><page sequence="28">What is immediately striking about these epilogues is their very presence in critical studies of texts and issues whose contemporary relevance is far from obvious. One may well doubt that works of criticism on the Bible or Talmud or Jewish history, dense with cross-references and citations, could helpJews find each other sexier, or reshape Jewish gender relations, or create loving homosexual bonds between Jewish men and their Father God. But whatever doubts these epilogues give rise to have deeper roots than just the gap between a high-powered academic text and a populist political agenda. More basic even than the difficulty of bridging theory and practice is the internal contradic- tion at work within the theories. The personal epilogues of the books bear some resemblance to (now somewhat obsolete) trends in femi- nism: forthright declarations of political goals, faintly embarrassing personal confessions, direct addresses of one's partners in revolution, and earnest pleas for the relevance of their scholarship. Unlike the feminists, however, for whom critique of traditions and canons is usually unburdened by apologetics, the work of Biale, Boyarin and Eilberg- Schwartz also takes on the challenge of defendingJudaism andJewish texts from various critiques. What emerges inJewish studies of the body is a series of hybrid texts, one part apology for an embattled tradition, one part radical critique of this tradition, and one part personal con- fession. The competing impulses of critique and defense are perhaps clearest and strongest in the case of Carnal Israel, with Boyarin's self-de- clared Orthodoxy and feminism standing in sometimes uneasy relation. The same holds true for Eilberg-Schwartz's conclusion, which leaves the critique of the biblical God far behind, attempting instead to combine a feminist analysis of patriarchy with a spruced-up view of the positive potentialities of divine and human masculinity; the patriarchal and potentially castrating God, in his view, can thus be transformed into a cuddly new-age deity by reclaiming the positive homosexual aspects of the divine-mortal relationship. And Biale, in "Creating De- sire," juggles the liberatory characteristics of Eros with a call for guard- ing the borders of the body politic. By comparison, feminism appears a relatively simple enterprise. Obviously, none of these political agendas can be reduced to a simple slogan behind which the Jewish masses can rally. The problem with the sort of political engagement expressed here has something in common with the more general problem facing men who consider themselves feminists-how to clear a theoretical and conceptual space for new visions of Jewish tradition and Jewish masculinity. As it turns out, the crux of the turn to the body in Jewish Studies seems to be not so much the difficulty of arriving at corporeal experience, but rather the com- [142] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="29">plexity of negotiating a space for a politically committed male Jewish scholarship. Can an informed and feminist criticism not only analyze and criticize the Jewish library, but also rescue at least some of it for contemporary purposes? These critics seem to believe that it is possible, but one wishes that they had come up with more valuable treasures than the rabbis' attentiveness to their wives' sexual desires, a no-doubt laud- able quality but one which now strikes us as a rather quaintly one-sided exhortation. And doesn't Eilberg-Schwartz's call for a homosexual reli- gious experience only serve to mitigate what is after all a very sharp critique of an earlier version of such experience? For all their sincerity, the critics under review here are only tentatively making the first steps toward setting forth their programs, uncertainly rendering a new set of myths in the course of explicating and rehabilitating the old ones. Notes * This essay was prepared in the context of numerous conversa- tions with Peter Eli Gordon, whose insightful comments helped me reach the conclusions recorded here. 1 The first of these books is Michel Foucault, The History of Sexuality: Volume I: An Introduction, trans. Robert Hurley (New York, 1980 [1976]). The Zone series, subti- tled Fragments Toward a History of the Body, and edited by Michel Feher with Ramona Naddaff and Nadia Tazi, appeared in six vol- umes (New York, 1989-1993). 2 Caroline Walker Bynum, Holy Feast and Holy Fast (Boston, 1987), argues that medieval Chris- tian women used eating and ab- staining from food as a physical channel for religious experience, rather than as a means of abstain- ing from physical pleasure and sustenance. Manipulating their food intake also allowed women to exercise a measure of control over their domestic lives that might have otherwise been de- nied them. See also Peter Brown, The Body and Society: Men, Women, and Sexual Renunciation in Early Christianity (New York, 1988). 3 Howard Eilberg-Schwartz, "Intro- duction," in People of the Body: Jews andJudaism from an Embodied Per- spective, ed. Howard Eilberg- Schwartz (Albany, 1992), 2. 4 Elaine Scarry, The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World (New York, 1985), 4. 5 Gilman is getting at this notion in the following (unfortunately not very elegant) passage on the Jewish voice: "The creation of the image of the Jew who is iden- tifiable as different because he or she sounds "too Jewish" pro- vides a model through which we can see the structure of the image to create an absolute boundary of the difference of the Jew even as this boundary his- torically shifts and slides.

Sander Gilman, The Jew's Body (New York, 1991), 11. 6 Ibid., 63. 7 Ibid., 127. 8 Ibid., 5. 9 Ibid., 88. It seems to me that the term "Schmuckkasten"may, in fact, have been used to refer to the va- gina precisely because of the iden- tification of the word for jewelry with the one for penis. If Freud did not mention the connection between "Schmuckkasten" and "Schmock" (not "Schmuck?), per- haps it was because it would have been obvious to all readers and implicit in the very nickname it- self-after all, did not "Schmuck- kasten"come to mean "vagina" precisely because of these associa- tions? 10 Ibid., 87-88. 11 David Biale, Eros and the Jews: From Biblical Israel to Contemporary Amer- ica (New York, 1992), 7. 12 Ibid., 11. 13 There is no inherent reason, of course, to view the importance of fertility in the Bible as reflecting demographic, rather than psycho- sexual anxieties, as Biale does: "Fertility was a central compo- nent of biblical religion, a result, no doubt, of the Israelites' sense of their origins as a small, weak people." (Biale, 12). This careful sociological approach is in con- trast, for instance, to Elaine Scarry's description of biblical ge- nealogies, with its attempt to im- agine a region where "body and belief' are completely "folded in on themselves": "[Genealogies] have ... a tone of triumph and self-assurance that is simply awe- some: it is only their formal ca- dences and rigidly parallel sequences that control, that just barely contain, the excitement im- plicit in their assertions." (Scarry, 185). In passages like this one, sexuality and fertility, pleasure and mortality, are revealed less as competing impulses than as psy- chologically intertwined, mutually reenforcing conditions. 14 Biale, 4. 15 Ibid., 16. 16 Ibid., 17. 17 Ibid., 4. 18 Ibid., 29. 19 Ibid., 40. 20 Ibid., 109. 21 Ibid., 144. 22 Ibid., 213. 23 Ibid., 230 24 Eilberg-Schwartz, "Introduction," 1. 25 NaomiJanowitz, "God's Body: Theological and Ritual Roles of Shi'ur Komah," in Eilberg- Schwartz, People of the Body, 188. 26 Ibid., 189. 27 Ibid. 28 Elliot R.

Weissler concludes that 'The authors of the tkhines [who were writing for a female au- [144] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="31">dience] want to understand how God's justice can require women's suffering. But the au- thors of the two musarworks [writ- ing for a more general audience] want to know why women are the way they are, whence the arche- typal nature of the irreducibly Other springs."

From Brakhot (there does not appear to be a more spe- cific citation). On Boyarin's read- ing, Kahana's description of Rav's mouth is meant to convey his rel- ish for the act of intercourse, not his wife's or his own virginity. 37 Ibid. Foucault's unequivocal stance against sexual surveillance has its problematic aspects, which have some corollaries in the Tal- mud. One of the more disturbing passages in Foucault's work, for instance, disapprovingly describes the proliferation of sexual catego- ries, pathologies and analysis as a somewhat absurd intervention in banal human interactions; his pri- mary example is an incident we now might call the sexual abuse of a little girl by "a simple- minded farm hand" living in the village of Lapcourt who was turned in to the authorities in 1867: [H]e had obtained a few caresses from a little girl, just as he had done before and seen done by the village urchins round about him, for, at the edge of the wood or in the ditch by the road lead- ing to Saint-Nicholas, they would play the familiar game called "curdled milk." So he was pointed out by the girl's parents to the mayor of the village, re- ported by the mayor to the gen- darmes, led by the gendarmes to the judge, who indicted him and turned him over first to a doctor, then to two other experts who not only wrote their report but also had it published. What is the significant thing about this story? The pettiness of it all; the fact that this everyday occurrence in the life of village sexuality, these inconsequential bucolic plea- sures, could become, from a cer- tain time, the object not only of a collective intolerance but of a judicial action, a medical inter- vention, a careful clinical descrip- tion, and an entire theoretical elaboration. (Foucault, 31) Boyarin's congratulation of the Tal- mud for not getting involved in the bedroom has related ramifications for the safeguard of the less powerful par- ticipants in the marital scene. In fact, the possibility of a rabbinic reluctance to intercede in the case of marital rape is explored in 113 ff., although Boyarin does not explicitly discuss the dangers of a society that leaves the sex- ual arena unregulated. 38 Boyarin, 132. 39 Ibid., 133. 40 Ibid. 41 Ibid., 196. 42 Ibid.

Boyarin goes on to sug- gest that perhaps the equation is not meant insultingly at all, which seems quite plausible. 44 Howard Eilberg-Schwartz, God's Phallus: And Other Problems for Men and Monotheism (Boston, 1994), 21. In Sigmund Freud, TheFuture of an Illusion, Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, trans- lated and edited byJames Strachey, vol. 21 (London, 1953 [1927]), 19. I am aware that monotheism may be an inaccu- rate description for theJewish worship of a single God, which im- plies more aboutJewish loyalty (not always firm) to "their" God than their belief that only one God existed. I use this term in ac- cordance with Eilberg-Schwartz's reference to biblical religion under that rubric, just as I use Eilberg-Schwartz's adjective "Jew- ish" to describe the people else- where called "Israelites." 45 Eilberg-Schwartz, God's Phallus, 92 46 Ibid., 155. 47 Ibid., 142. 48 Foucault traces contemporary dis- course on homosexuality to "nine- teenth century psychiatry, jurisprudence, and literature of a whole series of discourses on the species and subspecies of homo- sexuality, inversion, pederasty, and "psychic hermaphrodism." (Foucault, 101) 49 Eilberg-Schwartz, God's Phallus, 24. Presumably Eilberg-Schwartz is describing the subjective appre- hension of God, which is necessar- ily partial, but there is something of the empirical about his tone here, as if God did have facial fea- tures that could be objectively ob- served. 50 Harold Bloom, The Anxiety of Influ- ence: A Theory of Poetry (Oxford, 1973), argues that strong poets are always in conflict with their lit- erary precursors in a form of Oe- dipal rivalry. It may be an exaggeration to say that Bloom ig- nores the mother, since she some- times appears in the figure of the Muse. The active characters, how- ever, are all male, while the Muse is merely an occasional bystander, figurative emblem of the struggle between literary generations. As Bloom writes: "What is the Primal Scene, for a poet as poet? It is his Poetic Father's coitus with the Muse. There he was begotten? No-there they failed to beget him. He must be self-begotten, he must engender himself upon the Muse his mother." See Bloom, 36- 37. 51 Biale, 230. 52 Boyarin, 242. 52 Eilberg-Schwartz, God's Phallus, 241.
