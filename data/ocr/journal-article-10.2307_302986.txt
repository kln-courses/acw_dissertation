<plain_text><page sequence="1">Structures of Metaphor in Robbe-Grillet's Last Year in Marienbad Linda Dittmar Robbe-Grillet's critical essays show him to be an energetic op- ponent of the dominant literary tradition and a combative proponent of the French New Novel. Yet for all his self-consciously polemic stance, Robbe-Grillet does not clarify what the New Novel is to accomplish. For A New Novel and his other essays are not a manifesto or a guide to his fiction and films, and they can even be quite misleading.1 In particular, the notion that the "new" fiction is "objective," cleansed of all meta- phoric and allegoric allusions, has generated misconceptions and erroneous readings of his texts. His most quoted essay, "Nature, Tragedy, Humanism" (New Novel pp. 49-75) argues that metaphor and allegory are anthropomorphic projections which create a fog of indistinct significa- tions. "A Future For The Novel" and "On Several Obsolete Notions" (NN, pp. 15-24, 25-47) put forth the same argument. Things are simply "there," and such meanings as people discover beneath their sur- face are inventions which ascribe coherence and significance to a neutral and non-signifying universe. (This position echoes Ortega y Gassett's call for a "dehumanized" art which is purged of metaphoric resonance and subterranean communication.) Robbe-Grillet's critique of subjectivity and 215</page><page sequence="2">psychology, and his insistent advocacy of "neutrality," encourage readers to take his own descriptive passages for detached, emotionless records. His position, then, locks some readers into what Roland Barthes calls a chosiste bias, which overlooks the imaginative and subjective character of his art. In an early and influential essay Barthes encourages readers in their understandable inclination to accede to Robbe-Grillet's proclama- tions. Barthes argues that Robbe-Grillet's fiction concerns only the visible surface of things. Robbe-Grillet, he suggests, deprives his objects "of all possibility of metaphor" and treats them as mere phenomena, with "no alibis, no resonance, no depth."2 By noting the link between Robbe-Grillet's notion of "thereness" and Heidegger's philosophy, Barthes provides Robbe-Grillet with a philosophical context which encourages a chosiste interpretation and, so, deflects readers from direct evaluation of the text. In his "Prdface" to Bruce Morrissette's Les Romans de Robbe-Grillet (Paris: Editions de Minuit, 1963), Barthes does acknowledge the existence of a humaniste Robbe-Grillet side by side with the chosiste, but because much of his preface centers on Robbe-Grillet's technique, and because Barthes concludes that sense is finally suspended-not merely hid- den-in this fiction, he continues to downplay the humanistic dimensions of Robbe-Grillet's art. Barthes's position has spawned numerous studies which attribute to Robbe-Grillet's fiction specious neutrality and a detached reproduction of surface images.3 Olga Bernal's Alain Robbe-Grillet; Le Roman de I'ab- sence (Paris: Gallimard, 1964) is an interesting variant on Barthes's posi- tion. Bernal also takes seriously Robbe-Grillet's claims to neutrality and objectivity, but because her interpretation glances back to Husserl, Mer- leau-Ponty, and Sartre, she ascribes to Robbe-Grillet a "refusal" of signifi- cation that is more active than the Heideggerian separateness Barthes perceives. Starting with the same chosiste presupposition, Bernal is critical of Robbe-Grillet while Barthes is laudatory. According to her, Robbe-Gril- let's metaphysics of "absence"-the lack of humanistic engagement she perceives-are a matter of choice. Bernal allows that the modern ex- perience of nothingness makes this "refusal" understandable, but she ac- cuses Robbe-Grillet of negativity because moral "absence" is not the only response one can have to the phenomenal world.4 Fortunately, other readers have been able to withstand the pres- sure to accede to Robbe-Grillet and Barthes. Morrissette's excellent analy- sis of Robbe-Grillet's work has been especially important. Morrissette resists uncritical chosiste interpretations. He identifies the contradiction between Robbe-Grillet's theory and practice, and he recognizes that ob- jects in Robbe-Grillet's art function as "supports" for human emotions and are charged with significance and lyricism. His compelling exegesis stimulates a rich appreciation of depth in works which Barthes de- scribes-in his preface to Morrissette's book!-as "mates." Morrissette's 216</page><page sequence="3">phrase, "la subjectivit6 objectivee," attempts to lay to rest the debate over Robbe-Grillet's objectivity. Still, though this concept can lead to an inter- esting analysis of Robbe-Grillet's subjectivity, Morrissette does not develop it fully. Rather than discredit the chosiste approach outright, he allows Barthes's position to coexist with his own, all the while fostering sensitiv- ity to the presence of metaphors in Robbe-Grillet's work.5 A similarly independent appreciation of psychological resonance and metaphoric depth in Robbe-Grillet's treatment of objects shapes other studies of his work. Among them, George H. Szanto's Narrative Conscious- ness is notable for its attention to Robbe-Grillet's narrating consciousness as a psychological entity which determines the shape and mood of each of his fictions.6 Szanto distinguishes between Robbe-Grillet's supposedly ob- jective mode and the absolute subjectivity which emerges from it. This kind of subjectivity, he suggests, has its roots in the way Robbe-Grillet engages the readers' invention. Because it depends on the readers' height- ened awareness of their own imaginative activity, it elicits a different kind of interpretive transaction than ordinary metaphoric communication. Ac- cording to Szanto, Robbe-Grillet's objects "suggest"; they do not "equate." They are related to T. S. Eliot's "objective correlative," but unlike metaphors they do not evoke parallel emotions. Like Morrissette's la subjectivit6 objectivee, Szanto's "suggestion" offers a new formulation that does not quite settle the debate over Robbe-Grillet's objectivity. Robbe-Grillet's subjectivity actually reveals it- self through both suggestion and equation. It engages his audience both in guided interpretative processes (Szanto's "suggestion") and in metaphoric correlations, and this dual engagement accounts for the unique subjectivity he projects. Still, the important point is that his art is not chosiste. Neu- trality, after all, cannot exist in narrative art. Significations emanate in- eluctably from the transaction involved in any articulation. Words and images are allusive utterances which express and resonate. Robbe-Grillet may be right when he argues that our universe is "there" without design or significance, but he is wrong to suppose that artifacts-imaginative arrange- ments-can shed the encrustations of meanings. He may be right to identify the New Novel as "new" (certainly its creative use of decomposi- tion and synchronic rearrangements are typical of the postmodern imagination), but this innovation is hardly free of allusive content. In fact, it is a misplaced emphasis that accounts for this discrep- ancy between theory and practice. For despite the literary cast of Robbe-Grillet's rejection of existentialist "engagement" and the suggestive content of traditional European fiction, his impulse towards objectivity and innovation articulates, first, a philosophical orientation. His polemics rest on a belief in science as the necessary and sole basis for accurate knowledge and, therefore, progress. He attacks metaphoric thinking not as a lesser good but as a force of conservatism leading to despair. He argues that metaphoric writing relies on layers of correspondences which inhibit 217</page><page sequence="4">accurate observation and lead to rumination about a Beyond while blind- ing us to the nature of our world. "Science," he writes, "is the only honest means man has for turning the world around him to account" (NN, p. 70). However, science is neither as objective nor as ethical and progres- sive as Robbe-Grillet suggests. The reproduction of a perceived reality does not guarantee progress, and human perception cannot be free of prefer- ence and association. Robbe-Grillet attributes absolute objectivity to "the world" and to "things" without taking into account the transactional nature of perception. When we see objects or remember them, as when we imagine them, we provide interpretation. Both in their making and in their reception literary objects, too, cannot exist independently of human shaping, at least not as long as they depend on conventional language. The symbolic system we call "language" uses acoustic entities to elicit interpretative associations and a plurality of meanings. The literary experience consists of a transaction in which the author, the narrative voice or voices, and the reader all engage in shaping meaning out of verbal materials. Thus, Robbe-Grillet's narratives express an inevitable tension between a seemingly objective form and an intensely subjective statement. While he tries to restrict his work to the world as it might exist independently of human observation, his writing attests to the fact that one cannot escape subjectivity. In his work, disciplined precision coexists with what gradually emerges as irrational, repressed, and passion- ate layers of human experience. As we get to know his narrative view- points, it becomes evident that his seemingly scientific attention to the surface of things is not a dispassionate examination of objective truth. Rather, it is an obsessive effort to distort or avoid facts, springing from a well of unarticulated passions. The fact that theory and practice do not meet in Robbe-Grillet's novels and films would not invite comment were it not that this disjunc- tion inspires and shapes his work. His meticulous attention to objects (to people ascending an escalator in Snapshots, for example, or to Mathias's string collection in The Voyeur) uses language as though it were purely denotive; yet even while his words list information in a seemingly dispassionate manner, they amass tension and excitement. There is no doubt that Robbe-Grillet writes with disciplined attention to precision and objectivity, but the results of his efforts bear no resemblance to the scientific accuracy on which he insists. (Jealousy's traversing shadow gathers passion and significance and its centipede-squashed, conveniently, in the shape of a question-mark-acquires obvious metaphoric resonance. In The Labyrinth uses the grid of the city's interminable snowy streets to ascribe inhospitality to the city and enigma to the soldier's obsessive quest.) The tension and excitement Robbe-Grillet generates partly depend on plot fragments which withhold information and use menacing situa- tions to capture the audience's attention. But for the monst part the tension and excitement grow out of the radical disjunction between his seeming 218</page><page sequence="5">objectivity and the emotions he stirs up. Words are never purely denotive, and Robbe-Grillet's sequences and inventories reveal variations, contradic- tions, and changes which emerge as his narrative's main events. His alleged objectivity is not an epistemological method but a ruse. As it masks and represses the subjective, it highlights the tensions between the objective and the human. The embattled consciousness, in its struggle to impose objectivity on materials which by their very nature resist it, emerges as Robbe-Grillet's protagonist. In fact, the publication of the 1976 Colloque de Cerisy devoted to Robbe-Grillet shows a change in his own view of metaphoric communi- cation.7 On this occasion he acknowledged the metaphoricity of his own work and, by doing so, he freed his readers to explore its resonance and depth without engaging them in unnecessary debates. My own essay, which initially was to take issue with his claims to objectivity, need not be polemical. My original proposition-that his art is highly subjective and metaphoric-remains unaltered. Since metaphoric patterns are especially explicit in Last Year In Marienbad, analysis of this cineroman is particular- ly instructive.8 The esthetic and psychic converge in this work with special clarity and function both as a vehicle for an epistemological quest and as a comment on that quest. Together they express a yearning for creation and certainty and a doubt about the very process they generate. This essay, then, explores the relation between form and theme in Last Year In Marienbad. Robbe-Grillet's thematic preoccupation with quest and entrapment is evident, of course, in the setting, characterization, and plot-fragments which comprise the work. More important, though, is the very structure he imposes on his materials. Both the cineroman and the film use the idea of quest and entrapment to determine the organiza- tion of the work. The narrative form Robbe-Grillet develops functions metaphorically and evinces an anguished doubt concerning the efficacy of the transcendence he seeks to affirm. The fact that Marienbad exists in two media-the printed text and the film adaptation-does not alter its central communication. Word and film are different conveyors of mean- ings, but Resnais's version is singularly faithful to Robbe-Grillet's text and generally preserves the import of the verbal materials. Even when Resnais's taste and personal concerns lead him to modify the text, his modifications enhance and purify-not alter-Robbe-Grillet's vision.9 (In the following discussion I will note connections or distinctions between the text and the film whenever pertinent.) Notions of the labyrinth, of entrapment, and of resistance to possession stand out in Marienbad. The myth of the labyrinth governs the entire structure of this work, and the action and the physical space which encloses that action illuminate the myth repeatedly. As soon as the camera 219</page><page sequence="6">backs away from the credits (showing that they are elaborately framed, lifeless) and glides down a passageway, it defines the space in which it moves as a labyrinth. It scans frames, doors, windows, and corridors, en- dowing the architectural details listed by X's voice with visual form, while its suggestive treatment of light establishes the mood indicated by Robbe-Grillet's early set description: Beginning at the end of the credits, the camera continues its slow, straight, uniform movement down a sort of gallery of which only one side is seen, fairly dark, lit only by regularly spaced windows on the other side. There is no sunshine, it may even be twilight. But the electric lights are not on; at regular intervals, a lighter area, opposite each invisible window, shows more dis- tinctly the moldings that cover the wall. (M, p. 18) The dimness of the set creates a sense of indistinctness and gloom, and the alternation of light and dark areas suggests access to a lighter outer space which exists obliquely, as a possibility. In the film, X's description ac- companies the camera's glide down the gallery, while in the text X's monologue anticipates the glide and shapes our subsequent impressions. The two versions are close. Both show a portion of the labyrinth, tell of more, and create the impression that the labyrinth extends into an un- known Beyond. Repeated attention to mirrors and to the action captured in them asserts that knowledge is often oblique. Robbe-Grillet's mirrors obscure the distinction between objects and their reflections and multiply spaces through reflected images. Just as the camera backs away from the credits to reveal their frames, so it backs away from a conversing couple to reveal that we have been watching only their reflection. Mirrors are often dark, their reflection murky. Some mirrors consist of small squares which fur- ther refract the visual field and make palpable the sense of an infinite regression in space. The camera can present actuality and reflection in a direct, immediate way. It can provide an instantaneous documentation of the way trompe I'oeil and baroque ornamentation cause spatial disorienta- tion. A shot of two checkers players seen against an infinite regression of colonnades, galleries, ballustrades, and checkered floors is a particularly explicit illustration of how regularly patterned flat surfaces can acquire limitlessly receding depth (picture, M, p. 43). Even the garden, despite its apparent openness and clear lighting, turns out to be a perplexing en- closure. Like the hotel, it is a grid of paths that lead nowhere. The geo- metric simplicity of its design masks a profusion of possibilities. Both the film and the prose version have us explore space sequen- tially, through visual motion and its verbal equivalent. At one point, for example, Robbe-Grillet instructs the camera to pull back and reveal A in a 220</page><page sequence="7">garden path. The widening vista draws attention to the length of the path and the labyrinth-like nature of the garden. To emphasize A's entrapment, Robbe-Grillet spells out the sequence of its unfolding: "A tries again to escape, turning at right angles in the opposite direction to her first turn, but again she gives up" (M, p. 74). Throughout Marienbad, a continuing and apparently aimless motion of the camera and characters in a maze-like space suggests that the inhabitants of that space are lost in its passageways. The narrative obsessively traces corridors, galleries, and rooms, whose only use seems to be that of enclosing space and leading to others like them. The characters seem to move through these spaces without any of the physical strain which normally accompanies human locomotion. Their arms do not sway, their heads do not bob. They move as though conveyed on a dolly, without apparent volition, without purpose. A is the only character whose body occasionally expresses psychological strain or desire, and even her movement is for the most part emblematic: she either sways or freezes into discrete formulations of emotion. Against the background of a supporting cast which mimes entrapment, and in a space that enforces entrapment, A mimes the straining to be free. What the camera achieves through tracking and pulling away and through mirrored images, the soundtrack achieves through its own forms. At first a sound disturbance makes X's voice indistinct; two identical but staggered soundtracks muffle his voice until the two versions are recon- stituted into one. The film in particular demonstrates the need for auditory adjustment. Lips move without sound, and dancing couples move to the rhythms of an inner tune, out of step with the soundtrack which accompanies them. When a ballustrade collapses, the soundtrack registers gushing waters, and when a small orchestra is seen performing, the sound- track accompanies it with organ music. Such displacements question the evidentiary use of documentation. They provide an auditory version of the metaphor of disorientation caused by multiple possibilities. The dialogue elaborates the same metaphor. Fragments of conversation recur with slight variations, uttered by different characters. They reiterate segments of events-a rumored love affair, an anecdote concerning the freezing of the hotel's pond, a woman's pleading with an insistant suitor to keep quiet, and so on. At various times the same conversation seems to be engaged in by different characters, without ever giving a complete version of any alleged incident. As murmurs, silences, and allegations predominate, pos- sibilities multiply. The meaning of utterances, like the meaning of Marien- bad's visual materials, depends mostly on conjecture. Readers and viewers find themselves meandering in quest of coherence. Thus it is only appropriate that when X's monologue becomes distinct, it clarifies nothing. What initially seems merely a technical dis- turbance turns out to be yet another blind alley in the quest for co- herence. X's voice lists observations in a meandering succession that leads nowhere: 221</page><page sequence="8">Once again-I walk on, once again, down these corridors, through these halls, these galleries, in this structure- . . where corridors succeed endless cor- ridors-silent deserted corridors overloaded with a dim, cold ornamentation . . . -sculptured door frames, series of doorways, galleries-transverse corridors that open in turn on empty salons, rooms overloaded with ornamen- tation ... (M, p. 18) Versions of this description recur-a droning, somber, rhythmical transla- tion into language of the spatial labyrinth. Like the visual images, X's monologue insists that "there is no way of escaping" (p. 36). The same words recur in slightly varying combinations, free of traditional syntactical structures. The punctuation does not classify or organize; it merely lists and indicates rhythmic pauses. As sequence and context lose their conven- tional function, they yield a new meaning: verbal fragments, repetitions, and variations constitute analogues to the visual evocation of the labyrinth. Robbe-Grillet describes X's voice as slow, rhythmical, warm, but marked by a certain emotionless neutrality ("Une certaine neutralite," French ed. p. 24). The word "certain" may obscure the contradiction between the warmth and the lack of emotion, but it does not eliminate it. Robbe-Grillet eschews explanation and insinuates the contradiction as unresolvable. X is to dramatize simultaneously two contradictory modes of being-the emotional and the dispassionate. Such contradictions abound in Marienbad and acquire an enigmatic and even metaphysical dimension. While the dim opulence of the set, for example, stifles in its profusion, it also creates an illusion of receding depth and, so, of escape. Claustro- phobia coexists with the promise of a Beyond. The black and white film stock, too, sustains opposites without accounting for them. "There are some extremely clear details,... " Robbe-Grillet writes, "without its be- ing apparent what source of light is responsible for these strange effects" (M, p. 22). The contrast between dimness and brilliance becomes allusive and enigmatic because Robbe-Grillet notes the strangeness of the effect without accounting for it. Thus, a domed ceiling is obscured in darkness while its ornamental crown remains mysteriously brilliant. Similarly, when the audience in the hotel's theater is "illuminated by the very spectacle they are watching" (M, p. 22), the emphasis on the "spectacle" as the source of an "illumination" (rather than on footlights as a source of light) suggests an inspirational experience that transcends the purely material.10 Despite the inspirational quality of the lighting, despite the mystery that may hint at a Beyond and, so, at hope, the hotel's physical structure remains oppressive. Its very architecture seems to impose a sti- fling aimlessness on its residents: 222</page><page sequence="9">Man:... I can't stand this silence, these walls, these. whispers you're imprisoning me in ... Woman: Don't talk so loud, please don't. Man: These whisperings, worse than silence, that you're imprisoning me in. These days, worse than death, that we're living through side by side, you and I, like coffins laid side by side underground in a frozen garden.... (p. 31) This is the world from which the characters crave escape but find none. Its inhabitants seem doomed, bound by a deadly spell. Like their game of dominoes, their world is "a perfect labyrinth, a twisting path of futile complications" (M, p. 140. Italics mine). The enormity of such a subjuga- tion of life's forces becomes evident when we compare Marienbad's world to traditional paintings of equivalent palatial scenes. Bellotto's paintings of the Schonbrunn Palace (1759-1760), for example, register similar formal- ity of design and imposing proportions. His grounds are graced with elegant figures and sport a maze of finely-clipped shrubbery. Even his concern with perspective and light and shade has a striking affinity with Robbe-Grillet's. But Bellotto also depicts gardeners in their shirt sleeves and, at the front of the palace, ordinary citizens going about their daily affairs. In contrast, Robbe-Grillet seals his world. He never shows the hotel front opening to the other world, and he never allows ordinary humanity to penetrate the grounds. Both works use elongated shadows cast on gravel, but while Bellotto studies patterns created by the afternoon sun, Robbe-Grillet depicts a garden where people cast shadows amidst shrubs which remain shadowless (picture, M, p. 96). Eerily, Robbe-Grillet ques- tions the material existence of the world he depicts, but not the material existence of his characters. His interest is in magic and mystery, while Bellotto's is in optics and social intercourse. III Inevitably, Marienbad engages readers and viewers in a quest for some governing principle which could rationalize its inexplicable phenom- ena. The bewitched somnambulence permeating the hotel invites a search for the force-presumably an evil one-which has cast its spell over the characters. Robbe-Grillet's avowed socialism and his naming the opening drama "Rosmer" suggest a specific social reading. Though "Rosmer" 's plot does not resemble Ibsen's Rosmersholm, its stifling atmosphere and its period staging and costumes echo Ibsen's attacks on the destructiveness of bourgeois conventionality. It is therefore possible to consider the hid- den force which rules the hotel an intangible social pressure which denies the generative thrust of life. Except for X, however, no one challenges or even explores the social constrictions so evident in the hotel, and even X is 223</page><page sequence="10">more concerned with A than with the society that binds her. His dissocia- tion of the personal from the social and political suggests a psychological or metaphysical reading of the work; it directs our attention to individual forces and vulnerabilities more than to the social structure which nourishes them. The social meaning remains merely latent in Marienbad. The protagonists' names, appearance, and roles elicit associations concerning archetypal human preoccupation with sex roles, with good and evil, and with life and death. The figure of M concretely embodies male power, menace, and control. X's attempt to persuade A to leave the hotel is tied inextricably to his competitive masculine struggle with M. We have here the conventional love triangle, redolent with potential metaphoric meaning. We can read the narrative as a lover's attempt to take the passive- ly resisting A ("A" for I'Amour? ) away from her husband M (le Mari? ), or as the attempt of the Stranger, X (un inconnu11) to violate a woman, or, conversely, to free her from social constriction.1 2 More broadly, X can also be a liberating life force trying to exorcise a menacing Death ("M" for la Mort? ) or a knight-errant engaged in a mythic struggle against a demon- ic being for yet another Sleeping Beauty-a feminine embodiment of Love, earthly or divine. While the work sustains all these readings, the first two are the least satisfying ones. The texture of Marienbad's metaphoric con- tent is less concerned with monogamy and social constraints than it is with the struggle, broadly conceived, to transcend annihilation. Robbe-Grillet's treatment of M underlines his concern with the struggle against an annihilating, and possibly demonic, power. Though he describes M merely as a man of about fifty, stylish, tall, and gray-haired (M, p. 36), the powers he ascribes to M are supernatural and emphasize his sinis- ter nature, not his maturity. M's power is most evident in the episodes of the Nim game, a game he always wins.13 Like the unexplained illumina- tion noted earlier, the mystery of his intellectual control is disquieting. The game episodes call forth recurrent, archetypal fantasies of the alleged predilection Death and the Devil have for playing games with Man. Such games are, typically, games of domination, not of chance. (Echoes of Bergman's The Seventh Seal, 1956, are particularly noticeable.) Though Robbe-Grillet describes M as older and grayer than Piteoff, Piteoff's strik- ing acting and appearance bring out the essence of Robbe-Grillet's idea. Piteoff's bony face with its prominent teeth and sunken eyes recalls death's head; his skeletal body and chilling smile almost carry a whiff of the nether world. He translates M's necromancy into readily visible terms. M is the one who supplies X and A with the authoritative version of the statue's allegory. The sequence is ironic, echoing Robbe-Grillet's own ob- jections to the projection of undue signification into objects. But, since the factual information M provides alludes to a treason trial, metaphoric signification becomes inescapable, and M's seemingly objective statement acquires a chilling quality. Whether we read or view Marienbad, thoughts of the supernatural 224</page><page sequence="11">are inevitable. The film's visual symbols have the advantage of immediacy, but they do not alter Robbe-Grillet's original conception: In this sealed, stifling world, men and things alike seem victims of some spell, as in the kind of dreams where one feels guided by some fatal inevitability, where it would be as futile as to try to change the slightest detail as to run away. (M, p. 11. Italics mine.) The people who inhabit this world seem to be the Living Dead, dancing their version of la danse macabre. The dance scenes illustrate the suggested spell vividly. Stiff, impassive, almost inanimate, the dancers shift their location in the salon, oblivious of the dissonant music which accompanies them. Their bodies frozen into dance's conventional gestures, they move as though conveyed by some mechanical device or as shadows projected by a magic lantern. Throughout Marienbad, the timeless, formal elegance of the costumes elevates the characters above the commonplace, and during moments of heightened intensity Seyrig's clothes acquire distinct symbolic value. For her garden escape she wears a diaphanously winged dress, a starkly white tight gown trimmed with an abundance of white feathers during the supposed rape, and a long black cape with jet feathers enclosing her terrified face during a tense nocturnal encounter.14 Mime and cos- tume create a highly stylized image of a hermetic world governed by its own rites. Photography and editing enhance the eerie mystery of this world. Characters materialize and disappear in ways that defy ordinary experi- ence. They appear from one side when the logic of a given sequence requires them to appear from another, and the camera often approaches them indirectly, through disorienting mirror-reflections. The camera seems to suggest that the surface of glass is not impenetrable. It echoes Cocteau's use of mirrors for the door to Hades, and it hints at a supernatural expla- nation for the events it records. The murky twilight in which the allusions to death and the supernatural occur creates a somber and menacing mood, while the complication of design inherent in the baroque d6cor conveys strain and unease. The camera, the lighting, and the decor function as metaphors for emotional content. In A's room, for example, the ornamen- tation becomes increasingly florid as the passion of X's urgency and A's resistance mounts (see pictures, M, pp. 93 and 135). The baroque play on depth and impenetrability, its sinuous immobility, and its elegant forma!- ity express visually conceptual enigmas and contradictory yearnings. Since these enigmas and yearnings cannot be accounted for or resolved in natural terms, and given the macabre context which surrounds them, they evoke in readers and viewers a supernatural interpretation. In his book, Le Cinema fantastique, Ren6 Predal provides a useful formulation of the supernatural as we see it in Marienbad-15 Though 225</page><page sequence="12">Predal studies mostly what we call "horror" films, his discussion of Marienbad in the context of conventional zombies, vampires, and extrater- restrial beings articulates Robbe-Grillet's non-material, archetypal preoc- cupations. According to Pr6dal, "fantastic" cinema creates a world entirely separate from materiality, a world that is a pure mental state, a projection of the author's fantasies. He identifies in Marienbad themes of deceptive vistas, of death-dealing entrapment within a mocking expanse, and of dark and forbidden intercourse with demonic powers. Though Marienbad is not separate from materiality, its treatment of the material concerns mental states and supernatural motifs, and not the solidity of specification which Henry James sees as central to the classic realistic novel. The camera, X's monologues, and X's and A's preoccupation with the evidentiary use of objects explore the material mainly as a projection of the non-material. Robbe-Grillet's interest is primarily in the mental activity which generates narrative materials and interprets them. Predal is right to describe Robbe-Grillet as surrendering in Marienbad to "the alchemy of appear- ances" while leading his audience to "a land of mirages"-a land of images, illusions, and imagination. Robbe-Grillet's mirages include more than his allusions to the labyrinth, to love triangles, and to fantasies of possession. He draws on considerable additional metaphoric content, which is, if anything, all the more powerful because it is less specific. Marienbad's baroque setting, for example, constitutes such metaphoric content. Marcel Brion's essay on the baroque and the esthetics of movement provides an excellent analysis of the psychological state expressed in baroque architecture.16 In particular, Brion points to the transcendent aspiration expressed by baroque architec- ture, the passion and uneasiness it combines, and the sublime anxiety and hope which mingle in its tempestuous atmosphere. Baroque structures, he notes, exalt animated fragmentation, the straining in diverse directions, transformation, and rupture. Most important, he sees this architecture as the setting for a ceremonial cult, for a complicated and severe ritual, which grows out of a profound love of life and which celebrates death in an attempt to annul death's power. When we apply Brion's analysis to Marien- bad, the appropriateness of the baroque set becomes striking. The hotel's funereal atmosphere conveys turbulence rather than quiescence. Its gran- deur, fragmentation, complication, and strain give plastic shape to a pas- sionate resistance as well as to a stifling melancholy. As Brion puts it, L'ambition et L'aboulie, L'inquietude et la volont6 de puissance, le culte de I'action et le scepticisme quant aux causes et aux resultats de cette action, composent en- semble le bizarre amalgame d'elans et d'hesitations qui constitue le fond de "homme baroque." (M, p. 22) The forces Brion mentions stand out in Marienbad with excep- 226</page><page sequence="13">tional clarity. Both text and film express an intense aspiration towards freedom, self-actualization, and-through them-towards eternity. It is not accidental that towards the end of his essay, "Nature, Humanism, Trage- dy," Robbe-Grillet quotes from Unamuno's The Tragic Sense of Life (1912). Though not immediately apparent, the pain and yearning which underlie all of Robbe-Grillet's work resemble the profound pain and yearn- ing in the metaphysical quest which inspires Unamuno's writings. The violence of aspiration so typical of the baroque is the necessary counter- part to the scepticism which neither Unamuno nor Robbe-Grillet ever shake off. As Christine Brooke-Rose notes, at the core of the baroque vision lies "a systematic doubt in the validity of appearances, a doubt which expresses itself as an obsessive concern for appearances.1 7 Robbe-Grillet's commitment to "scientific" precision coexists with a pro- found scepticism concerning the usefulness of precision. Scrutiny of the hotel's architecture, its garden, maps, and meteorological records never leads to certainty. X's use of pieces of evidence to substantiate his story is equally inconclusive: "last year's" snapshot, the picture over the mantle- piece, the shoe with the broken heel, or the torn pearl bracelet contain powerful metaphoric content but provide none of the desired documenta- tion. Alleged incidents seem to recur in different and even contradictory ways. Despite systematic examination neither X nor his audience can order Marienbad's details into a coherent pattern. The "obsessive concern for appearances" becomes a ritual which attests to the need for comprehen- sion and control rather than to their attainment.1 8 IV The skeptical condition is a tormented one; it cannot be a per- manent resting place for the human mind. Sooner or later a leap of faith becomes necessary, and in the works of Robbe-Grillet, this leap means the generation of new narrative materials-new variations, new possibilities. Robbe-Grillet and his protagonists attest to the coexistence of skepticism and faith. They question the invented materials and at times discard them, but they also celebrate the ongoing process of invention. They demonstrate the ways in which close attention to objects confounds scien- tific objectivity, and, finally, they substitute for the scientific quest a commitment to the pure, creating vision.19 In Marienbad-as in In the Labyrinth, which follows it-we see the intense subjectivity of the seem- ingly dispassionate method especially in the way the plot evolves as one idea generates another. Like an overture, the opening sequences present the motifs to be developed. The images the camera isolates early on as it travels towards the hotel's theater become increasingly significant as Marienbad unfolds. The opening play projects an intensified reflection of the events, style, and setting which are to gather in the story of A and X. Once the curtain falls, the play's audience becomes the potential carrier of 227</page><page sequence="14">the plot. The camera scans the audience as different couples articulate fragments of the conversation which is to become the domain of A and X. We witness a continuing search for protagonists to elaborate and enact the germinating plot. The search is marked by intense suspense, by a tension reminiscent of Cassavetes' early improvisational films (especially Sha- dows, 1959) and of Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author (1922). It is the tension-almost ecstasy-of the imagination engaged in the act of invention. Only gradually do A and X emerge as Marienbad's protagonists, and even then the restless sorting of latent materials continues. Versions proliferate and generate additional variations, and the imaginative effort to shape these materials becomes increasingly pronounced. As when the two tapes need alignment in the opening soundtrack, or when sound effects need to conform to images, at times X's account of events and the images which accompany his account need alignment in order to produce a coherent-if not truthful-version of these events. As these materials change to agree with one another, Marienbad documents the deliberate effort the adjustment requires. Thus, when X describes a past episode in which A was supposedly leaning against a balustrade, "the voice stops. A is not in the position indicated by the text being spoken . . . She then cor- rects her position.... A having corrected her position, X's voice continues immediately, as if it had waited only for this" (M, p. 62). On another oc- casion X talks of a past event which is not recorded visually. The com- plementary image shows A in the present listening to his account, yet when she laughs X says, "Then you began laughing," using the present event to confirm his report of the past (M, p. 52). Both incidents concern the disjunction between image and account, but they use this disjunction in different ways. The laughter episode reflects X's need for validation; he adjusts his account, using A's present act to prove the accuracy of his memory. In contrast, the balustrade episode shows X in control of the visual materials. The effort to align image and report recurs in Marienbad and establishes Robbe-Grillet's preoccupation with evidence and validity. X's claim to intimacy with A, for example, hinges in part on whether there was a mirror or a snowy landscape over the mantlepiece in A's room. The work documents both options, endowing them both with equal validity and, significantly, with an identical frame. It also invalidates both options by displaying that mirror in the public salon several times before it reap- pears in A's room. One could conclude that Marienbad implicitly assumes that anything imagined exists, without distinction among the seen, the remembered, and the invented. Even this comforting system, however, proves unreliable. During X's supposed visit to A's bedroom, A and the visual image refuse to complement his account, though he struggles desper- ately to control them (M, p. 125); later on X repudiates an emergent ver- sion that suggests he had raped A (M, p. 147). To some extent the relative 228</page><page sequence="15">autonomy of image and account derives from the varying points-of-view which govern each sequence.20 At times A's will prevails and X's narrative has to concede to it, and at times X's will prevails and shapes the material. Images become a form of dialogue in their own right. They re-enact the motif of persuasion, relying on the notion that perception depends on one's will and imagination and not on the stimuli one encounters. Still, the points-of-view of X and A account only partly for the disjunction between image and sound. The music at Marienbad's opening and conclusion remains independent of the protagonists' point-of-view, as do other dissynchronized sounds throughout. The overture is "a romantic, passionate, violent burst of music, the kind used at the end of films with powerfully emotional climaxes" (M, p. 17). At the end this music reasserts its autonomy when "it rises and prevails" (M, p. 165). In its attention to artificiality and clich6 this music comments ironically on the surging emotions it expresses. The irony is, of course, the author's, but because Robbe-Grillet has immersed us in his protagonists' point-of-view, the irony seems attributable to the music's own judgment. Similarly, the camera's early treatment of the credits dramatizes their metamorphosis from artificiality to verisimilitude, and as the work ends the camera's final act is to draw back from the hotel's moonlit facade. Robbe-Grillet explicitly endows the camera with expressive autonomy: The camera draws closer to the young couple, at the same time as the sound of their voices fades (instead of growing louder). The young couple is then seen in a rather vague close-up, and the camera passes them, as if it had passed through them. The sound of their voices has disappeared completely. Having thus eliminated the couple, the camera comes to a stop with a stationary shot which reveals what was behind the couple. (M, p. 36) Robbe-Grillet's language disguises the fact that the camera is a tool controlled by himself, by Resnais, and by the photography crew. The film version matches the text closely. It allows both the camera and the tape-re- corder to be obtrusive and it endows them with autonomy, intelligence and selectivity. The camera is a restless, probing one throughout. It closes in on characters or dismisses them with an immensely assertive independ- ence. Anyone familiar with Marienbad's film version will recall the "white scenes" in particular as exemplifying the camera's active role. As Morrissette notes, the camera gradually takes over; it seems to reach such intense emotion that the very quality of the celluloid is affected. The "white scenes," however, do not appear in the text. The film intensifies the camera activity Robbe-Grillet indicates and its new materials go be- 229</page><page sequence="16">yond the text's original meaning. In attributing to the camera an ecstatic role, the film crosses the watershed between skepticism and faith. While the reiterations and variations of small segments of the bedroom scenes still echo the concern with veracity, light and rhythm dominate the audi- ence's experience. The camera re-enacts the motifs of rape and lovers' union. It penetrates A's room in a hastening, pulsating movement, and the film becomes over-exposed as though in response to the passion it records. The scene functions as an intense orgasmic metaphor in its own right. It surrenders to an unreasoning ecstasy which makes considerations of verac- ity seem petty and beside the point. It repudiates the "scientific" investi- gation of facts and, instead, celebrates the creating energy which generates clusters of visionary utterances. V There is something touching about the assumptions that lead certain artists to link their art to science. Zola's theory of the "experimental" novel, for example, Durrell's adaptation of Einstein's relativity theory, or Robbe-Grillet's effort to recreate in fiction the apparent neutrality of scientific observations are all efforts at self-validation. They grow out of a nagging uncertainty about the merit of literature. In a world where science is considered the door to well-being, artists often feel pressured to justify their work as useful and, so, progressive. In "Nature, Humanism, Tragedy" (NN, 49-75), Robbe-Grillet links progress to science very explicitly, and this linking makes him try to approximate science in his art. But Robbe-Grillet obviously does not approximate science. In his novels and films passionate materials and a seemingly neutral stance come together in a paradoxical union. The "white scenes" which Resnais added to Marienbad illuminate this paradox because they contrast with Robbe-Grillet's intention. While Resnais celebrates explicitly the subjective vision, Robbe-Grillet remains committed to his seemingly dispassionate method and to the disturbing gloom which characterizes Marienbad throughout. Robbe-Grillet never comes out on the side of invention as fully as Resnais does. He never resolves the conflict between his desire for objective knowledge and the inevitability of subjectivity and doubt. Given Robbe-Grillet's commitment to a dispassionate narrative mode, the uncontrollable nature of the irrational stands out forcefully in his work even though it is less explicit than in Resnais's version. Marienbad communicates through a network of referential signs charged with emotional content. Robbe-Grillet's metaphors function like T. S. Eliot's "objective correlative": they communicate through juxtaposition.21 They are statements of equivalency where the concrete becomes a sign for a particular emotion. Thus, A's torn bracelet becomes equivalent to her violation, the hotel's decor becomes equivalent to the inner turbulence of 230</page><page sequence="17">its guests, and the mirrors and oblique lighting become equivalent to the epistemological mystery enacted in this work. The very structure of Marienbad functions metaphorically. Neither the book nor the film sorts out its episodes. Neither provides a clue as to what is actual, what is remembered, and what is imagined. Past, present, and fantasy become indistinguishable, and the words "true" and "false" lose meaning. It is easy to interpret this dislocation of chronology and of notions of truth as yet another labyrinth, this one implicating the audience directly in the quest for coherence and escape. This interpretation applies the conventional use of metaphors to the overall structure of the work. It creates yet another equivalency, this time of form and content: the work concerns entrapment in a labyrinth, and the form dramatizes it. Seeing Marienbad's structure as a formal recreation of its content is not inaccurate, but it is too limited. Robbe-Grillet sets up an equivalency between form and content in all his works, and he always uses the labyrinth-physical or spiritual-to express entrapment and quest. However, identifying Robbe-Grillet's predilections is useful mainly as they illuminate the new material-the synthesis-which emerges from the apposition. The important fact is that, by doing away with chronology and veracity, Robbe-Grillet also does away with notions of causality. One cannot rearrange the fragments of Marienbad into a coherent narrative of a recognizable human experience. Costume, setting, and the time and place in which incidents occur are all protean and ever-changing. The snapshot of A, for example, seems at first to document a past event; when it turns into an animated scene one could still take it for a dramatized memory of that event, except that later on the snapshot reappears in A's bedroom in an unexplained profusion of copies. The sequence startles because it divorces the snapshot from its anticipated evidentiary use without providing an alternative explanation. Robbe-Grillet withholds the comfort of traditional order and coherence. To appreciate Marienbad one must overcome established habits of reading and film-viewing and accept the fact that the search for a conventional plot is futile. Anyone trained in conventional narrative art will find it hard to accept Marienbad on its own terms. Worse yet, Robbe-Grillet himself puts obstacles in the way to this acceptance. He describes the work as "the story of a persuasion" (M, p. 10), and the sequence of episodes he provides does unfold like a persuasion: the opening play foreshadows the ending, X's courtship gathers fervor, and by the end A and X seem to be leaving the hotel. Despite the blind alleys and false starts, this sequence stands out and functions as a decoy. It uses the convention-bred need for linear development to entice us to engage in the frustrating drudgery of sorting out episodes in order to sustain a hypothetical chronology. Marienbad, however, obviates this effort. Its elusive patterns cannot be rationalized as "memories" or "fantasies." For one thing, what do we do with such metamorphoses of content as those in 231</page><page sequence="18">the snapshot sequence and in others like it? And how do we understand the fact that the work starts in the present tense and ends in the past tense? 22 The transition from present to past occurs imperceptibly. The dialogues, naturally, remain in the present and sustain the immediacy of action, but X's monologue ("Once again-I walk on ... ") shifts to the past tense early on, passing for a reminiscence of the alleged "last year." As the validity of the reminiscences becomes increasingly dubious, the audience is likely to reclassify some of X's reports as fantasy. This effort to rationalize the information is natural, except that as the work draws to a close it leaves the audience in an untenable position. A and X appear in their travelling clothes, apparently leaving, and the next shot-the final one-shows the receding facade of the darkened hotel. While these visual materials signal an exit, X's voice tells a somewhat different story: The park of this hotel was a kind of garden a la francaise without any trees or flowers, without any foliage. ... Gravel, stone, marble and straight lines marked out rigid spaces, surfaces without mystery. It seemed, at first glance, impossible to get lost here . . . at first glance ... down these paths, between the statues with frozen gestures and the granite slabs, where you were now already getting lost, forever, in the calm of night, alone with me. (M, p. 165) Marienbad ends with these words. Obviously, this ending does not signify a simple departure to a freer life. The surfaces do hold a mystery, and the claustrophobia persists. "Marienbad" is not Mariansk6 Lazne, and the thought of X and A starting a new life together in Brussels or Lyons, is, at best, absurd. The final version of X's monologue describes a past event-A's eternal loss, with X, in darkness. The passage is obviously ambiguous. Though it recognizes A's union with X and hints that getting lost may mean getting found (just as death means a freedom of sorts in the end of Ibsen's Rosmersholm), the ending is inconclusive. Past and present form a cyclical continuum resembling the Moebius strip. The audience must either deceive itself and ignore the move from the present tense and the import of X's final words or else give up the need for conventional narrative. Marienbad functions as the audience's private labyrinth in the sense that it uses our habitual responses to narrative to lure us into a continuing and hopeless struggle to rationalize its materials. Robbe- Grillet's "Introduction" is no golden thread. It calls our attention to the conceptual labyrinth he has erected, but it does not reveal his overall vision or the nature of the persuasion he considers the core of this work: 232</page><page sequence="19">A brief synopsis is enough to show the impossibility of using it [the story] as the basis for a film in traditional form, I mean a linear narrative with "logical" developments. The whole film, as a matter of fact, is the story of a persuasion: it deals with a reality which the hero creates out of his own vision, out of his own words. And if his persistence, his secret conviction, finally prevail, they do so among a perfect labyrinth of false trails, variants, failures and repetitions! (M, p. 10) Despite this statement, it is not at all certain that X prevails. His final monologue is elegaic, not victorious, and only one sentence separates it from the work's end: "Afterwards the music rises and prevails" (M, p. 165).23 The ending, like the entire work, resists efforts at rationalization. One can try to suppress unwelcome inconsistencies, but this approach cannot satisfy. It implicates the audience in a quest for practical solutions and obscures the larger vision of the work. To accept the vision readers and viewers must abandon the quest for traditional meanings. They must repudiate the labyrinth, not merely seek to leave it. Only a recognition of the ambiguities of this work, a willingness to sustain-rather than suspend-disbelief, will free its audience to experience it fully. Robbe-Grillet's art depends primarily on interior processes which generate clusters of visual and acoustic signals. It is the audience's task to translate the signals into recognizable signification and to integrate the clusters into a coherent whole. The audience's active role does not mean that the emergent coherence derives from mere subjective projection. As we saw, Robbe-Grillet charts its course and controls it through his use of familiar symbols and archetypal preoccupations. Clustering and accumula- tion are central to his communication and depend on a guided audience engagement. Like any narrative, Marienbad unfolds sequentially. But while traditional narratives rely on the audience's memory to produce a linear understanding of causal sequences, here clusters of meanings exist mainly as explorations of alternative versions. Robbe-Grillet relies on the audience's memory to retain overlapping layers of evolving visions. The experience of the work in its entirety is polyphonic. A cumulative awareness emerges through sequences of vision. As in a musical or architectural composition, Marienbad's fragments derive meaning from the succession of patterns they form, not from their discrete representational validity. The work depends on the connections between its parts, on the repetitions, juxtapositions, and variations it traces. The metaphoric materials echo and supplement one another, weave in and out of prominence, and are gathered and reiterated in the total structure of the work. The compositional attention to location, pacing, and duration is so pronounced that it almost displaces 233</page><page sequence="20">such representational interest as the work may hold. The struggle to transcend entrapment and death informs the emotional content of the work, and Marienbad's traditional use of metaphors invites the audience to share sympathetically in the experience of the protagonists. At the same time, the fractured composition engages the audience's reason and imagination and invites it to appreciate the complexity of the unfolding design almost as if it were an abstract creation in its own right. The excitement of juxtaposition, for example, depends only in part on the juxtaposed materials; selecting materials is important, but the manner and duration of their presentation qualify meaning and produce esthetic experience quite independent of the thematic concerns which originally underlay the selection. The interest here is largely rhythmic and structural, and it depends on a tight system of reciprocal relations. Since both the cineroman and the film version of Marienbad are narratives, the reciprocal relations on which they rest can unfold only in time. Though the two media reach their audience in different ways, to a great extent the fascination of this work in either medium depends on the gradual evolution of narrative options. Marienbad is never static. Its sequences elaborate on earlier material or provide a counterpoint to them. It lures its audience into intimate complicity with the authorial preoccupation with the generation of fiction.24 Marienbad is not "spatial" in Joseph Frank's sense of "spatial form."25 Dismantled chronology, truncated events, and inconsistent accounts do not transmute it into a spatial arrangement of narrative fragments which coexist on a plane readers and viewers can grasp in an instant. There is no escaping the fact that it takes an hour and a half to watch this film and several hours to read the text. A spatial, visual analogy such as Frank's distorts the temporal nature of either medium. Marienbad is not iconic or static. Words like patterns, systems, design, or composition do not necessarily describe static interrelations. The elimination of "plot" (in E. M. Forster's sense of, "The King died and then the Queen died of grief") does not mean that simultaneity (Frank's "spatial form") has replaced temporality. In Marienbad, as in Ulysses, Under The Volcano, U.S.A., The Sound and the Fury, Pale Fire, Les Guerilleres, The Bluest Eye, and numerous other modernist and postmodern writings, the elimination of one type of sequence simply ushers in another. The above analysis of Marienbad emphasizes the inevitable diachrony of all narrative and, so, challenges the notion of "spatial form." The de-constructing vision of modernism and postmodernism repudiates chronological order but cannot transcend the temporality of articulation and reception. Early studies of cinematic montage are useful in their attention to the temporality of non-historical sequences. The "Kuleshov effect" showed that, for example, when the picture of an actor's expressionless face was followed by an empty plate, the audience believed that the face expressed hunger. Perception of disparate images, seen in 234</page><page sequence="21">succession, is a three-step process of receiving and assimilating materials into a coherent, if inconclusive formulation. "To achieve its result, a work of art directs all its methods to process," Sergei Eisenstein writes. "A work of art, understood dynamically, is just this process of arranging images in the feelings and mind of the spectator."26 The point is that the nature of narrative is necessarily sequential and dynamic. Networks of parallels and interrelated sounds and images have always functioned in literature and film as an ordering and communicating device, and the de-construction of recent art underscores the importance of non-chronological but sequential patterns. The elimination of one type of reasoning, namely, historical causality (Prolonged famine made them invade their neighbors' land; or, The king died and then the queen died of grief) does not mean that other types of reasoning have been abolished.27 De-construction entails re-construction, and-at least in fiction and film-such re-construction continues to depend on succession. Marienbad cannot divest itself of sequences. Its temporal nature compels participation in a process of ongoing invention, which reveals analogically Robbe-Grillet's perspective on the real world.28 Thinking of Marienbad in terms of structure, rhythm, and unfolding design may suggest that it approximates an abstract narrative. This view suits Robbe-Grillet's manner and style. The controlled precision of his writing and the brilliance with which he develops and juxtaposes narrative sequences are so striking that they call attention to themselves at least as much as to the human situations they portray. The intuitive discoveries in which he engages his audience direct that audience to appreciate the work primarily as a process of generating narrative materials.29 Indeed, even aspects of his metaphoric content seek to convert human experience into abstractions: the algebraic formulations of human relations seen in the naming of the protagonists, the calculations of the Nim game, and the classifications of X's catalogues. However, excessive emphasis on the abstract qualities of this work can be misleading. The formalist preoccupations which shape its overall design and the fragments within it dramatize the process of imagining and composing. Marienbad, finally, concerns the process of Becoming. It implicates its audience in ethical and esthetic choices as it engages the audience in those rational and irrational acts which constitute fictional invention. Through this engagement in the production of sense the audience comes to share the quest for essences, the metaphysical-even religious-yearning to reach the source of knowledge, and the ecstasy of a creating vision. Quest, yearning, and ecstasy are the sources of Marienbad's vision. Archetypal metaphoric content and a radical fracturing of design join in this work to affirm these fundamental qualities of the human spirit. Marienbad does escape "tragedy" in Robbe-Grillet's sense of despair and acquiescence, but it does so through engagement, not objective detachment. Its dislocation of esthetic and epistemological conventions 235</page><page sequence="22">elicits our capacity to liberate the imagination and restructure thought. It is progressive not because it leads us to Robbe-Grillet's "scientific" knowledge of a documented reality but because it frees us to pursue new visions.

Originally published as Pour un nouveau roman (Paris: Editions de Minuit, 1963). Robbe-Grillet's call for a revolutionary change echoes Maurice Blanchot's statement that in order to worship (Blanchot's metaphor for writing, in this instance) one must first destroy the old forms of worship: "Ecrire, c'est d'abord vouloir d6truire le temple, avant de I'6difier."

Works which incorporate this notion of "objectivity" into a broader analysis of modern and postmodern literature are especially important because this orientation affects their treatment of literary developments in general.

Michele Esteve (Paris: Lettres Modernes, 1974). Irving Massey (Uncreating Word) also sees Robbe-Grillet's preoccupation with objects as an abdication of creative response. In contrast, Marxist critics emphasize that Robbe-Grillet's narrative process is necessarily "engaged." In "Les Deux avant-gardes," M6diations No. 4 (1961-62), pp. 63-83, Lucien Goldmann describes this fiction as embodying the valorization of objects in post-war capitalism, and he emphasizes the dialectic of anguish and hope articulated in Robbe-Grillet's fiction. See also Jacques Dhaenens's analysis of La Maison de rendez-vous (Paris: Lettres Modernes, 1970) and Jacques Leenhardt's La Lecture politique du roman: La Jalousie (Paris: Editions de Minuit, 1973). 236</page><page sequence="23">5 Given the early date of Morrissette's book (1963), and the discriminating care of his excellent work, such caution is understandable.

As with Robbe-Grillet's chosiste interpreters, a footnote cannot do justice to these numerous "humanists" (to borrow Barthes's terminology). Bernard Dupriez's L'Etude des styles ou la commutation en littdrature (Paris: Didier, 1969) and Ben Stoltzfus's Alain Robbe-Grillet and the New Novel (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1964) are two books that should be mentioned.

This interesting essay has not received the critical attention it deserves. In it Robbe-Grillet addresses the issue directly and acknowledges the subjectivity of the New Novel. He describes Marienbad as a "play of subjectivity"-A's and X's, Resnais's and his own, and especially the audience's. 8 Alain Robbe-Grillet, Last Year in Marienbad, trans. Richard Howard (New York: Grove Press, 1962). Originally published as L'Annee Derniere h Marienbad (Paris, Editions de Minuit, 1961). Hereafter cited as M. 9 Robbe-Grillet wrote Marienbad between Jealousy and In the Labyrinth, and Resnais did much of Marienbad's shooting while Robbe-Grillet was in Istanbul working on L'lmmortelle. Jealousy and In the Labyrinth sustain considerable metaphoric content; L'lmmortelle, if anything, moves towards a surrealism reminiscent of Cocteau. 10 "Les figures sont sorties de I'ombre par le spectacle lui-mdme qu'elles contemplent" (French ed., p. 28). Though the English translation emphasizes the illumination more than the engulfing shadow, it does not inject undue suggestiveness. 11 Un inconnu is Robbe-Grillet's original language (French ed., p. 13). The relations between A, M, and X hint at an algebraic equation, a set of relations which Robbe-Grillet leaves incomplete. 12 For a discussion of M's games, the Oedipal fight between two men over a woman, and the theme of violation and mutilation, see Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel, Pour une psychanalyse de I'art et de la creativite (Paris: Payot, 1971). 13 See Bruce Morrissette's analysis of the Nim game in Les Romans de Robbe-Grillet.

This essay does not allude to Marienbad and was written, presumably, without any knowledge of Robbe-Grillet's forthcoming work. 17 Christine Brook-Rose, "The Baroque Imagination of Robbe-Grillet," Modern Fiction Studies, XI (Winter 1965-66), p. 406. See also Dominick Edwin Grundy, Skeptical Consistency: Skepticism in Literary Texts of Montaigne, Sir Thomas Browne, and Alain Robbe-Grillet (Ph.D. dissertation, Brooklyn, 1968). 18 According to Chasseguet-Smirgel, the proliferation and mirroring of objects and interactions expresses the breakdown of distinctions between the self and the non-self. It should be added, though, that Robbe-Grillet's interest in the fragmenting mind goes beyond portrayal of a disintegrating self to the mental state that enables one to explore an evolving fabrication. 19 My use of the word "pure" echoes Val6ry's essay on "Pure Poetry." The emphasis is on what he calls "a world of relationships distinct from the practical world," "a complete system of reciprocal relations between our ideas and images on the one hand and our means of expression on the other."

The impact of each version is necessarily different, with the text having an obvious advantage. 24 Marienbad "is not a subsequent account of a love story which happened earlier; it is a story in the process of happening," Robbe-Grillet writes. "This story is really in the process of being invented in your head and imagination." ("Objectivity and Subjectivity," New Hungarian Quarterly, No. 22 (1966), 88.

Kuleshov, "The Origins of Montage," Cinema in Revolution, Luda and Jean Schnitzer and Marcel Martin, eds. (New York: Hill &amp; Wang, 1973), pp. 66-76. Much of Eisenstein's essay studies verbal expression as Montage. His analysis of Leonardo da Vinci's notes for painting The Deluge is a particularly interesting contrast to Frank's analysis of Flaubert's country fair (Widening Gyre, pp. 14-17). Both authors study descriptive passages in which chronological time has been arrested, but while Frank concludes that Flaubert's juxtaposed images produce a spatial effect, Eisenstein emphasizes the temporality inherent in juxtaposition. Frank arrests a vital scene and turns it into a painting, while Eisenstein sees the verbal description as animating a static painting and turning it into a moving picture. 27 See also Robbe-Grillet's notion of historical causality as a "Balzacian order, a whole narrative system based on causality and chronology," ("Order and Disorder," Crit. Inq., IV, (Autumn 1977), 5. In this essay Robbe-Grillet affirms the ongoing process of creating (not attaining) order. He stresses that the interminability of this activity is a progressive force, for the violation of artifice ("codes"), as he sees it, is our one way of escaping the spiritual and political entropy of an "inert" and "coded horizon" (pp. 12-15). 28 Spanos, "Modern Literary Criticism," JAAL, p. 100. 29 See Morrissette, "Probl6mes du roman cinrmatographique." 239</page><page sequence="26">iA:lliftiolI- ...... ... ??An, 240</page></plain_text>
