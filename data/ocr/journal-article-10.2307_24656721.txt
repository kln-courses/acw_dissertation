Ohana, La polemique judeo islamiqueislamiqueislamique et I'image d'Ismael dans Targum Pseudo-Jonathan et dans Pirke de Rabbi Rabbi Elie^er (Partant de la mention de Aicha et de Fatima, la femme et la fille de Mahomet, dans le Targum du Ps. Jonathan a Gen. 21, 21, l'auteur elargit l'enquete a la fagon dont le targumiste a reinterprete les elements bibliques de l'histoire de Hagar et d'Ismael. II montre comment le Targum puise dans les midrashim, et tout particulierement dans les Pirke, en reorganisant deliberement, d'une maniere polemique, ces materiaux epars. Ce travail redactionnel de l'auteur du Targum s'inscrit bien dans l'epoque islamique, en cherchant a contrer les pretentions du Coran et de ses premiers commentateurs a faire d'Ismael et de ses descendants (les Arabes) les heritiers des promesses faites a Abraham. Oeuvre de compilation, le Ps-Jonathan temoigne cependant d'une reelle activite redactionnelle qui est orientee par cette polemique judeo-islamique. L'article constitue une etape des recherches de l'auteur sur la nature du Ps-Jonathan, sur ses rapports avec Onqelos et les recensions palestiniennes et avec les com pilations midrashiques: Ps-Jonathan apparait comme "un melange hetero elite au cachet bien distinct").

Melammed, The Targum of Proverbs (In 410 of the 915 verses this targum agrees with the Peshitta, and in 60 verses it has a word for word correspondence. Its dependence upon the Peshitta or its Syriac Vorlage explains its distinction from the other targums to the Hagiographa. It does not contain midrashim although Proverbs was a rich field for midrash in every period. The term אלהא is utilized for the tetragrammaton and 01נמ (νομος) for Torah.

The earlier Messiah of Ephraim would refer to the "Anointed for War" without any mention of defeat. An independent tradition described the earlier departure of Ephraim from Egypt and its defeat by the Philistines, viewed as punishment for this rebellion. These two traditions were fused and reinterpreted so that Bar Kokhba became the war messiah, defeated in battle and the tribe of Ephraim was punished merely for miscalculating the time of the Exodus.

This name could have been positively or negatively understood. Their name, Hasmonay, whose derivation is unknown, may have been a nickname for Mattathias, similar to Maccabee of Judah, but was not used in the early period of the dynasty, perhaps because it referred to their obscure origins).

The investigation leads to three main conclusions: 1. The direct employment of physical violence is almost invariably implied in the usage of the verbs, and particularly in their combined usage: 2. The context of the two words often shows that an attempt is being made to force people or things against their will or nature: 3. the context often implies (a) that the user of βία or άρπαγή has no right to the end for which it is exercised, and (b) that those against whom it is being used are being deprived of their rights. As to Matt. 11:12 this leads to the suggestion that the violence is that of powers of evil (probably zealotic Pharisees). But the author strongly emphasizes that the saying is a condemnation of the idea that the kingdom of God could be established or snatched by force of arms.

Leivestad's article Exit the Apocalyptic Son of Man (NTSt 18 (1971-1972), 243-267), there is still a problem to be solved, viz. how the designation Son of Man (mean ing simply "man") can be used in apocalyptic sayings in the Gospels (and only there). The author attempts to restore the proper links of the designation with Judaism, the rest of the New Testament and the teaching of Jesus. He argues that, although the Son of Man is not the designation of a particular figure in Judaism, apocalyptic thought embraces the concept of an agent of God in the coming judgment, who may be a character of Journal for the Study of Judaism, Vol. VII, No. 1</page><page sequence="9">REVIEW OF ARTICLES 92 the past reserved in heaven for this function at the end time. Secondly he shows that identification of Jesus with this figure is fundamental to the christology of widely separated strands of the New Testament, and that, in the sayings of the gospels only, the designation Son of Man was applied to Jesus in this role. Thirdly he suggests that Jesus did see himself as destined to perform this function in some sense, and that he referred to himself as the Son of Man on occasions when he needed to allude to his destiny); 104-110 M.

Noting the absence of criticism by Josephus of Antiochus IV's new deity in Jerusalem, he explores the notion that Josephus accepted this identification. Thus, the God of Israel in B.J.

The parallelism lmdjcwd (hifil) is found in Egyptian texts in the pair sb^jmtr. The hifil of CW in Sir. 4:11 must mean "instruct". The same holds good for some Old Testament passages where cwd (or a derivative, "instruction") occurs); 218-233 A.

The nomenclature of the Feasts was also Aramaic, as is demonstrated by the indeclinable usage of πάσχα and σάββατα in the Septuagint, σάββατα in the Zenon papyrus, and the transliteration άσαρθά of the Feast of Weeks in Josephus. So in the hellenistic period the official calendar of the Jewish communities was not composed in the Torah Hebrew but in the Aramaic of the Targums); 234-239 W. J. Fulco, Monnaies de Tell Keisan 1971-1974 (A list of coins found at Tell Keisan (1971-1974), containing four coins from Tyre (5th 4th cent.

The same pattern emerges when these expressions refer to humans, and thus, these translations, which have previously been understood as anti-anthropomor phisms, probably simply reflect the translation technique); 95-143 A.

Η. E. Gaylord Theologia Evangelica 8 (1975), 88-117 I. H. Eybers, Some Remarks about about the Canon of the Old Testament (There was no official meeting at Jamnia which decided about the Jewish Canon. The fact that only certain books were discussed, and that the terminology used was no innovation indicates that the Canon already existed at that period. Josephus ascribes canonical authority to twenty-two books, and he does this as being representative of the established belief of all Jews. This thesis is supported by NT and Qumran data. The conclusion of the Canon may fall between 165 and 100 B.C.E. An addition (p. 117) briefly deals with J. A.

This investigation shows that Antiochus' picture in Dan. 8:23-25 and Dan. 7 is typified by traditional conceptions: the image of the clever criminal is coloured and transmitted by the Wisdom tradition, whereas that of the enemy of divine order derives from oriental thought, which found its ultimate shaping in Egypt. The model of Cambyses, the "bete noire''' of Egyptian history, exercised its influence on Antiochus' portrait); 795-797 F. C.

It denotes some province of the Persian empire, the name of which is mentioned or may be understood from the context. With Ezra 2:1 and Neh. 7:6 the problem arises which province is meant.

LXX Am. 5:11 where br is rendered by έκλεκτός), as attested by the Georgian version. In that case the filius meus in 4 Esr. 7 and perhaps in later passages may reflect an ambiguous Hebrew text, and is not simply a a tendentious interpretatio Christiana of '■bd-π αΐς as υιός).

Moreover, katoikia denotes a rural military settlement and it would be impossible to have both a polis and katoikia katoikia together in Jerusalem. Dan. 11:39b is interpreted to refer to the Hellenized Jews whom Antiochus elevated. He may have sold lands to their polis in Jerusalem as its chora.
