<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dual Organization as an Operational Concept in the Pueblo Southwest Alfonso Ortiz University of Chicago In 1924, in a discussion of the moieties of the five Tewa-speaking Pueblos of north-central New Mexico, Elsie Clews Parsons (1924: 336) noted: "This moiety system is indeed a substitute for clans in the social consciousness, where it holds the outstanding position clanship holds, let us say, among the Hopi." In her later detailed monograph on Tewa social organization (Parsons 1929: 278), she elaborates on this point: ". . . the most prominent Tewa social classification is the moiety and for social organization the most significant habit of mind, the tendency to dichotomize." This point has never been fully taken up by subsequent students of the Tewa, or of the Pueblos generally. In this paper I will re-examine the notion of dual organization in the light of new data from San Juan, the northernmost and largest of the Tewa Pueblos.1 I shall use the term "dual organization" rather than "moiety," ex? cept where the latter refers to a formal social division. To be sure, Lowie (1948: 240) used the two terms interchangeably, and Rivers (1924) equated exogamous moieties with dual organization. However, in accepted usage, "moiety" has come to denote "half-tribes" (Lowie 1948: 240) or "a half of a society formally set off against the other half for whatever reason or purpose" (Kroeber 1948: 396). The term "dual organization," still current in the liter? ature though less frequently used, is free from the other term's rigidity of usage. More importantly, dual organization need not depend for its defini? tion upon the existence of moieties, though it may include them. By dual organization, then, I mean a system of antithetical institutions with the as? sociated symbols, ideas, and meanings in terms of which social interaction takes place. Thinking in contrasting sets may well be a universal human tendency, particularly with regard to cosmological notions, but it is when these contrasting sets have significant behavioral correlates that dual organi? zation can serve as an effective descriptive concept. In their myth of origin, the Tewa are said to have divided into moieties shortly after emergence from an underworld home in the north. Thereaf? ter, the members of the Winter moiety are said to have migrated south along the east side of the Rio Grande, subsisting on game along the way, whereas the Summer people subsisted on wild plant foods as they migrated south along the west bank of the same river. The moieties eventually rejoined and settled in a village on the west side of the river. Here the ancestors of the 389</page><page sequence="2">390 ETHNOLOGY present occupants of the six Tewa villages divided. In each such instance, the segments included members of both moieties. This is why, according to the myth, each village has both Winter and Summer people today. The divi? sion into Winter and Summer moieties is the principal expression of dual organization in San Juan. A child is usually initiated into his father's moiety by a three-stage pro? cess described below, but he may join the other moiety later in life if he wishes. This shift in membership is rarely made, but it is regarded as per- missible. Ordinarily, a bride also transfers to her husband's moiety after marriage, but she will not do so if she belongs to her moiety's ceremonial society. Her moiety-specific ritual duties take precedence over all other con- siderations. The existence of moieties among the Tewa despite the lack of uniform marriage and descent rules, is one justification for our adoption of the more flexible term. The moieties today have a number of names, with the first pair being most commonly used: Winter People Ice Strong People East Side People Ice People Turquoise People2 Summer People Summer Strong People West Side People Sun People Squash People There are other symbolic associations, some derived from the above names: Winter maleness strength hunting food: meat mountains, shrines, and lakes of the north and east colors: red and white Summer femaleness weakness agriculture food: wild and cultivated plants mountains, shrines, and lakes of the south and west colors: yellow and black These are just a few of the more prominent examples of symbolic antitheses. We may now examine their significance in actual behavior. There is no residential segregation of the moieties, but each group has a head who rules the village for a part of the year?the Winter Chief from about the autumnal equinox until a month before the vernal, and the Sum? mer Chief for the remainder of the year. From the earliest writing on the Tewa, there has been some confusion as to the relative importance of the two chiefs. This arose because informants either reported that the chief of their own moiety was the more important or else named the one who was in office at the time. The interpretations tend to favor the Summer Chief because he rules for a longer period of each year, but the Tewa themselves do not ordinarily conceptualize them in these terms. The division of the year corresponds in a general way to the subsistence activities of the Tewa. The transfer of authority to the Summer Chief in February is seen as initiating the agricultural season, and the Summer</page><page sequence="3">DUAL ORGANIZATION IN THE PUEBLO SOUTHWEST 39I Chief initiates the first of a series of three retreats, or "works," to bring "Mother Earth" to life again. They are spaced about 28 days apart and are called, respectively, "Bringing the Buds to Life," "Bringing the Leaves to Life," and "Bringing the Blossoms to Life," following the rebirth and growth of plant life from February to May. The next series of two retreats is also initiated by the Summer Chief, on about August 15 and September 15. They are called, again appropriately, "Harvest Work" and "Autumn Work." After his Autumn Work, the Summer Chief "gives the people back" to the Winter Chief. This ushers in the period of intensified hunting, which begins after all of the late crops are in storage. Although the Winter Chief initiates three retreats during his term of leadership, these are not oriented specifi? cally toward hunting. The probable reason is that hunting is not restricted to the autumn and winter months, and there is a specialized functionary, the Hunt Chief, whose job it is to promote success in hunting throughout the year. Although conditions of the past century or so have lessened the importance of hunting, in the sense that some large game animals are no longer available and others, now drastically reduced, can only be hunted in season, this is the way the Tewa still conceptualize their annual cycle of subsistence activi? ties. The Tewa data can thus be interpreted for economic purposes as a complex of antitheses centering around two major subsistence activities, with agriculture being the more important. Politically, dual organization is reflected in the division of ten annually selected officials into two groups which I shall call the internal organization and the external organization. The first is concerned with ritual matters and with keeping order within the village. It consists of the War Chief and five assistants, or War Captains, and was probably a native organization. The latter, imposed by the Spaniards, consists of the Governor, two Lieutenants, and a Sheriff. It is concerned primarily with the village's relations with the outside world. The moiety chiefs together select these officials in alternating order from among the men of their respective moieties. Those of the external organiza? tion are selected first, beginning with the Governor, then those of the inter? nal organization, beginning with the War Chief. Since the Governor is selected first, and the War Chief fifth, both come from the same moiety in any given year. This always results in an asymmetrical relationship between the moieties. But this arrangement favors the opposite moiety the follow? ing year, since their chief then gets to select the head of each division. It is in the realm of ritual, however, that the most impressive array of anti- thetical institutions and beliefs is found. Each moiety ceremonial society, con- sisting of the Chief and several assistants, conducts an infant initiation rite, the Summer Society in the spring and the Winter Society in the autumn. These rites are performed to bring newborn infants into the respective moieties of their fathers and new brides into those of their husbands. After the autumn rite the Winter Chief gives the mother of each infant a portion of dried meat, while the Summer Chief gives a sweet drink made from sprouted grain after the spring rite.</page><page sequence="4">392 ETHNOLOGY A second phase of moiety initiation occurs when the child is between the ages of six and nine. It is held every four years for the Winter moiety, and every seven years for the Summer, again in their respective seasons. The dis- crepancy in initiation intervals is due to the fact that Winter parents are re? stricted to the few members of the moiety ceremonial society in selecting sponsors. Since the sponsor has several duties with respect to each initiate, he can take care of only a few at a time. Summer parents can select as a sponsor any other Summer adult of the same sex as their child; thus they can afford to wait for a longer period between "Water-pouring" ceremonies, as the rite is called. Summer initiates are also restricted to eating specially pre? pared fruits and other plant foods for four days, whereas Winter initiates have no dietary restrictions; they may eat meat and anything prepared with it. Although still seasonally restricted, the third and final phase of moiety ini? tiation occurs at no set intervals. It is held whenever there are enough chil? dren of a given moiety between the ages of ten and fifteen. This last rite, called "finishing," is held in conjunction with a masked-god ceremony. Each initiate is whipped by the head masked-god impersonator of his moiety, and only initiated males may impersonate the gods of their respective moieties. The girls are said to be initiated only so that ". . . they will under? stand, someday when they get married, what their husbands mean when they say they have to attend to kiva duties." Beyond these observations on the early life cycle, each moiety sponsors certain ceremonies for the general good of the entire village. Associated with each moiety is a group of gods who visit the village only during these ceremonies. Those of the Summer, called "warm" gods, appear in the early spring from their homes in lakes to the south. They display the color sym? bolism of yellow and black in their dress. Those of the Winter moiety, called "cold" gods, come in the autumn from their homes in lakes to the north. They display red and white color symbolism in corresponding areas of dress. It is in conjunction with these ceremonies that the finishing rites are held. There are also two sacred clown societies in San Juan, with membership cutting across moiety lines. As groups, however, the Kossa are associated with the sun, and are attributed the power to cause warm weather, while the Kwirana are associated with cold, and are attributed the power to bring winter moisture. The latter are never called to appear when warm weather is desired, and their activities, at least during recent decades, have been confined to the autumn season. Thus far I have been discussing the moieties almost as if they were distinct and autonomous groups. How is integration achieved in Tewa society? Else? where in the myth of origin, two female corn deities are represented as the original mothers of all of the Tewa. White Corn Maiden represents the mother of the Winter moiety, while Blue Corn Woman represents the mother of the Summer moiety. It is from them that each Tewa acquires his soul at birth. Moreover, the two are regarded as acting together in instilling souls, not as being responsible only for the souls of the members of their respective moieites. This can be illustrated by an event which takes place during the</page><page sequence="5">DUAL ORGANIZATION IN THE PUEBLO SOUTHWEST 393 first few days of a child's life. At the conclusion of a naming ritual which occurs four days after birth, the midwife who delivers and names the child places an ear of corn on either side of its cradleboard. On one side is placed a perfect ear of white corn, symbolic of White Corn Maiden, and on the other side a perfect ear of blue corn, symbolic of Blue Corn Woman. These remain in place for a period of twelve days, to protect the child. Thereaf? ter they are carefully stored for planting the following spring. Another integrative mechanism is provided by the crosscutting member? ships of the two sacred clown groups, and of four other religious societies. More important is the fact that there is another set of dual organizations, again with crosscutting moiety memberships. These are called North side and South side people. They function only on three occasions: during rain races and an associated rain dance at the summer solstice and during the ceremonial shinny games in February. Their existence is explained as fol? lows. Long ago, the races and shinny games were conducted by the first set of moieties, but the Winter youths, though fewer in number, always won be? cause they are "male" and "strong." One spring, a hole where witchcraft objects were placed was discovered near the racetrack, and accusations flew back and forth between the moieties. The elders seized upon this occasion to divide up the people, on the basis of residence, into the north side and south side organizations. Residence patterns have since become thoroughly mixed, but each San Juan male knows his affiliation, tracing it in the patriline. The original symbolic associations remain, because San Juan residents say that both groups must start Winter youths in the rain races or they cannot hope to win. Conversely, the elders offer the following explanation of the fact that the South organization outnumbers the North by approximately three to two. Since the North group has Rain Standing Youth as its patron, and the South has Rain Standing Maiden, both represented by anthropomorphic fetishes, the former can never hope to rear as many children, "although they are stronger." This set of North side and South side dual organizations has never been reported in the literature, although as formal social divisions they are really moieties no less than the parent Winter and Summer organizations. This fact illustrates several things, the most important one, I think, being that the use of limiting (i.e., moiety) definitions inhibits further inquiry. Most students after Parsons have simply acknowledged the existence or non-existence of moieties in the Pueblos, without further inquiring what these moieties do and do not do, and what other forms of antithetical social groupings and symbolic representations there might be. A final example will serve to illustrate further this complex of dual yet interlocking organizations. Associated with the Winter and Summer divi? sions are two other major ceremonies, Basket and Squash. One of these is performed each year before the coming of spring. Masked-god impersonators may visit the village on the night before the ceremony, but they are not the eight gods associated with the Summer moiety nor the eight of the Winter moiety. Instead, four gods appear who are associated with the Bear Medicine Society. They are called teh pinge in, "of the middle of the structure." They</page><page sequence="6">394 ETHNOLOGY serve both moieties, the existence of a dual organization being reflected in their name. When the Squash Ceremony is held, the chief impersonator and the third are selected from among the men of the Summer moiety, and the second and fourth are selected from the Winter moiety. Conversely, when the Basket Ceremony is held the following year, the first and third imper- sonators are chosen from among the Winter men. The impersonators retreat for four days in the home of the head of the Bear Medicine Society, thus preserving the rule that members of one moiety may not enter the kiva of the other. The large kiva used for the actual performances is held in common by both moieties. This asymmetrical relationship between the moieties at any one time, the widespread occurrence of which led Levi-Strauss (1960, 1963) to doubt the very existence of dual organizations, is only such if we view it as a one-year process. As in the annual alternation of political officials, it becomes symmetrical when viewed in terms of a two-year cycle. The concept of dual organization can also be applied to more general problems in the Pueblo area, and three brief examples may be cited. There has long been an apparent anomaly in the Pueblo literature in the fact that Taos has been characterized as having "weak" moieties (Parsons 1924: 339^ I93^: 77"79? Ellis 1964: 48). This represents the only exception to the geographical cluster of groups with well-developed moieties, comprising the Tewa and Northern Tiwa (Parsons 1939a: 210). With reference to Taos, Parsons (1936: 5) says: "Moiety is expressed . . . not as a principle of de? scent?there are no Summer and Winter moieties to be born into as among the Tewa?but as a principle of kiva organization." This statement loses its note of finality when we recognize that the primary significance of Tewa moieties lies elsewhere than in descent. Dual organization at Taos is expressed in several interesting ways. There are six kivas, divided into a North and a South group of three kivas each. A now defunct seventh kiva was used by both divisions. All males belong to one group or the other, and each division has a head who is chosen by the heads of the three kivas. Each division head is entrusted with a fetish bundle which is inherited from his predecessor. The heads alternate in leading the annual ceremonial encampment at the sacred mountain lake. Races between the North and South divisions are another expression of dual organization at Taos, and formerly there were two sacred clown groups (Parsons 1936: 77-79&gt; 96)-. It is obvious that the differences between these and the Tewa data may well be primarily differences in the degree of formal expression of a common prin? ciple. The Picuris data (Parsons 1939a) also conform to this general pattern, perhaps reflecting more affinity to the Tewa. While we do not yet know the significance of the physical division of Taos into halves, located on opposite sides of a stream, this is a recurrent phenomenon among societies with dual organization, and only additional data can enable us to answer this and other questions. We may profitably ask questions of this type if we do not use marriage rules, or descent, or some other single criterion for dual organization.</page><page sequence="7">DUAL ORGANIZATION IN THE PUEBLO SOUTHWEST 395 Parsons, with characteristic care, left the problem open to further inquiry when she stated (Parsons 1936: 6): "I am less certain of the following [Taos] data than of any information I have recorded about the Pueblos during the past twenty years." In her last major work on the Pueblos (Parsons 1939: ii, 1211), she lists, as needed research, details on the ceremonial organization of both Taos and the Tewa. To turn to another problem, Wittfogel and Goldfrank (1943) have argued quite convincingly that the Eastern Pueblo irrigation societies tend to have more centralized authority than the Western Pueblos, notably Hopi, because the former must insure large-scale co-operation to maintain irrigation sys? tems. This conclusion, reached through an analysis of myths and available social organizational data, has now been accepted by most students o? the Pueblos. What is of interest for our purposes is that they did not cite any of the available sources for the Tewa and Northern Tiwa. This, in effect, elim- inated the northern half of the Eastern Pueblos from consideration. Tewa sacred myths usually revolve around the exploits of two persons, a male hunter and one of several recurrent corn maidens (Parsons 1926). This symbolic dualism with the male hunter and his agriculture-associated wife recurs with almost monotonous regularity, just as the themes of hunting and agriculture are linked recurrently in behavior, as described above. Thus any generalization on Pueblo subsistence must take into account hunting as a significant variable, and not only agriculture?or "male and female agricul? ture"?as Wittfogel and Goldfrank have done. A final example concerns the frequent references in the Pueblo literature to the effect that Tewa moieties tend to be endogamous (Parsons 1929: 91- 93; Eggan 1950: 305; Dozier 1960: 154). These interpretations derive from Santa Clara and San Ildefonso data, inasmuch as Parsons (1929: 91) reports that there is no native theory of endogamy at Nambe and that the tendency is less marked at San Juan. Little is known about Tesuque, the fifth group. This problem is important because it contradicts what we know about moieties generally, which is that they are usually exogamous, or at least agamous. Otherwise, a major integrating factor in societies of this type would be lost. In San Ildefonso, Parsons (1929: 93) reports only three households for the Winter moiety, so an agamous or exogamous relationship between the moieties is hardly possible. There was a factional split within the Summer moiety shortly after the turn of the present century (Whitman 1940: 431-439), and whatever endogamous tendencies developed may be due to these ad hoc dual organizations. Moiety, as such, may not enter into the picture at all. Santa Clara has also had a long history of factionalism (Aitken 1930: 384-387; Parsons 1939: ii, 1137), this time at least partly along moiety lines. In this case the endogamous tendency may be due to antagonisms reflecting a long-standing political stiuation, yet independent of the formal organiza? tion of the native moieties. This hypothesis is worth considering because my census data from San Juan and Tesuque, the two most conservative Tewa villages, show no endogamous tendencies which cannot be explained by the numerical imbalance between the moieties. In fact, no preference is ex-</page><page sequence="8">396 ETHNOLOGY pressed on the issue in San Juan. Thus, problems of this nature, which tend to be perpetuated in the literature, may be explained on independent grounds. In this paper I have re-examined and attempted to reinterpret some of the ethnographic problems of the Eastern Pueblos, particularly the Tewa, in the light of the concept of dual organization. Utilizing a less precise concept in place of an older one, the moiety, I have tried to show that the more flexible concept enables us to gain new insights into old problems, some of which were perceived by Elsie Clews Parsons several decades ago. Since the major social and cultural difference between the Western and Eastern Pueblos is the prominence of dual organizations among the latter, a point recognized by Eggan (1950), the concept is offered as an operational tool for organ? izing a significant area of Pueblo research.

Turquoise, coral, and some other minerals are regarded as cold-producing by the Tewa. During late winter public ceremonies, the participants are discouraged from wear? ing turquoise, coral, and silver jewelry in order to help prevent cold weather. BIBLIOGRAPHY Aitken, B. 1930.
