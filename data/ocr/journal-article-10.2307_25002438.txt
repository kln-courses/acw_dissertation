<plain_text><page sequence="1">GENETICS, ETHICS, AND FEMINIST THEOLOGY Some Recent Directions Lisa Sowle Cahill Scientific research in human genetics, especially the Human Genome Pro ject, raises a host of important ethical, social, and policy questions. Both pub lic and scholarly debate about these questions tends to place them against a horizon of ultimacy and sacredness, employing metaphors such as "quest for the Holy Grail," "blueprint of life," "the human future," "playing God," and "cocreation." Yet although theologians in general and feminist philosophers have produced extensive literature on these topics, ethical analyses from a specifically feminist theological standpoint have been sparse. Nor have femi nist philosophers given much consideration to the bearing of religious com mitment on reactions to the new genetics, except perhaps to note the deleteri ous effect of religious influence on women's reproductive freedoms. Moreover, feminist philosophers and the few feminist theologians who have addressed genetics have tended to concentrate on reproductive issues and on the importance and protection of women's decision-making capacity. Although these are vital concerns for feminism, my thesis in this review of re cent literature will be that feminist theological bioethics should shift direc tions, giving equal or perhaps greater emphasis to social-justice aspects of the new genetics. Indeed, this shift is already under way among feminist thinkers. Here theology promises distinctive contributions. In the words of Karen Lebacqz, the "first thing" theology brings to policy discourse is "justice as a crucial category," assessed in terms of "the plight of the poor" and accompa nied by "a willingness to let go of the landscape as we know it in order to per mit justice to be done."' The emerging literature and this article will engage mostly the Christian and, to a lesser extent, Jewish contributions of feminist theology on genetics, ethics, and justice, because thus far they are more abundant and prominent 1 Karen Lebacqz, "Theology, Justice, and Health Care: An International Conundrum" (paper presented at the University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden, April 2002), 6.</page><page sequence="2">54 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion than in other traditions. This is no doubt due largely to the fact that debates about genetics are occurring largely in the "First World" societies that have the resources to develop and use genetic innovations, as well as political and cul tural traditions that value scientific progress, entrepreneurial investments, in dividual rights, and media coverage of novel discoveries and political debates. Feminist analysis has taken shape in these same cultures and is only gradually extending its reading of genetic technologies to include their effect in or on other cultural settings. The contributions of feminist theologians will be com plemented by perspectives of feminist philosophers, in order to place the the ologians within larger currents of thought and to align them with new ones. Feminist theology can and should look forward to making important strides in addressing one of the most critical social prospects of the twenty-first century: the discovery of powerful new tools to attack disease, to redesign humanity, and to allocate access to social assets. Background: Gender and the New Genomics Medical uses of genetics of special interest to women have been available at least since 1978, when the first "test-tube baby" was born. The possibility of in vitro fertilization brought in its train a way not only to alleviate infertility but also to enlist genetic "donors" to contribute eggs and sperm to meet specifica tions, and to permit selection of embryos after preimplantation genetic diag nosis. Genetic options have been expanded as a result of the Human Genome Project, an international, thirteen-year effort formally begun in October 1990 under the auspices of the U.S. Departments of Energy and of Health and Human Services, with international partners in several countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, and China. Its aim is to discover all of the estimated thirty thousand to forty thousand human genes; make them accessible for further study; and eventually produce diagnostic tests, therapies for genetic disease, and possibilities for the genetic enhancement of the human species. Genetic research is also a path to the creation of therapies from cloned human cells and embryos. The Department of Energy predicts that "decoding the human genome will lead to new ways to prevent, diagnose, treat, and cure disease. Alterations in our genes are responsible for an estimated 5,000 clearly hereditary diseases, such as Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell anemia, and influence the development of thousands of other diseases."2 In June 2000, President Bill Clinton, at a White House event with British prime minister Tony Blair, announced that the international Human Genome Project (HGP) and Celera Genomics Corporation had independently com pleted initial sequencings of the human genome-"the genetic blueprint for 2 U.S. Department of Energy, cited in ibid.</page><page sequence="3">Cahill: Genetics, Ethics, and Feminist Theology 55 human beings," in the words of the press release.3 The competition between the publicly funded international effort and a private corporation to reach the same goal underscores an important facet of the new genomics: market prof itability. The HGP provides its results free of charge on the Internet, whereas Celera charges a hefty fee for subscriptions and intends to patent the processes it has discovered for commercial use. It put a premium on outpacing the HGP so as to claim ownership of genetic discoveries. Ethical analysis raises questions such as just access to benefits, appropriate counseling, the safety and effec tiveness of therapy, conflicts of interests (between, for example, mother and fetus, family members, insurers and clients, and employers and employees), confidentiality, coerciveness in testing and screening, discrimination, and eu genics, as well as embryo research and cloning. How do these possibilities affect women? Most obviously, they affect women's reproductive roles and choices. They also affect women's gendered social roles and opportunities. But perhaps most importantly, they are likely to have a negative effect on groups already suffering from social exclusion, within which women are doubly disadvantaged. This applies not only to categories in the United States, such as the uninsured and some racial and ethnic groups, but also and more strikingly to those in other countries and regions where ac cess to even basic health care is a rarity. In Genes, Women, Equality, philoso pher Mary Mahowald identifies numerous ways in which genetic science can affect women adversely, giving chapters titles like "Allocation of Genetic Ser vices and the Feminization of Poverty," "Ethnicity, Cultural Differences, and Sex Selection," "Genetic versus Gestational Ties to Children," "Disabilities, Feminism, and Caregiving," "Cystic Fibrosis and Misattributed Paternity," "Genetic Testing and Susceptibility to Breast Cancer," "Preimplantation Ge netic Diagnosis and Abortion," "Genomic Alterations and Women," and "Em ployment, Health Insurance, and the Public-Private Distinction."4 The first-order concern of feminists writing from the United States and Europe, when confronted with issues such as these, is the protection of women's autonomy. Since the 1960s, liberal feminism has typically centered on motifs such as "reproductive freedom" and "a woman's right to choose." In re cent decades this concern with autonomy has been qualified by a greater ap preciation of the social conditions that may limit the exercise of autonomy, even in cases where individual self-determination is a right granted in theory or by law. For example, many feminists have taken note of the fact that a woman's right to "choose" to take advantage of new reproductive technologies, preimplantation diagnosis, or genetic testing may be coerced by social pres sures to become a mother, to avoid giving birth to a child with a disability, or 3 See the Department of Energy Web site for information on the Human Genome Project, accessible at [www.jgi.doe.gov/whoweare/faq.html]. 4 Mary Briody Mahowald, Genes, Women, Equality (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000).</page><page sequence="4">56 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion to qualify for scarce employment. Conversely, the parameters of a woman's choice may dwindle to practical nonexistence if she lacks the insurance or other financial resources to purchase the services she desires. Mary Mahowald's book on women and genetics exemplifies a qualified lib eral feminism driven primarily by concern for women's equality of self-deter mination. She adopts "standpoint theory" to take account of and even to privi lege the views of women from "nondominant" groups, yet she aims to gather all these views under the aegis of an "egalitarian feminist standpoint."5 Apply ing her theory to the problem of sex selection, she concludes that, despite cul tural differences, sex selection on nonmedical grounds is sexist and always morally objectionable, even if cultural attitudes encourage it.6 This proposal ex poses a particular problem for virtually every variety of feminist theory today, one which will be of concern in this article: the tension between making global claims about justice for women, which seem particularly inevitable and justifi able when bodily realities like sex characteristics and pregnancy termination are in question; and respect for communal values and the indebtedness of any ethical judgment to the community in which one stands, which is especially necessary for feminist analysis coming from contexts of privilege. In a very useful and quite comprehensive overview of the international so cial and ethical ramifications of the HGP, Dorothy Wertz observes, on the basis of a review of thirty-seven nations, that "we in the West sometimes think our ethical views should lead the way for other nations.... Some concepts that form the cornerstone of Western biomedical ethics, such as individual privacy, individual autonomy, and the equality of women, are not integral to most non Western cultures," nor are they shared by every cultural group even within the United States.7 For example, confidentiality and secrecy have analogues in vir tually every culture, whereas "privacy" does not. The latter is a Western, En 5 Ibid., 7, 13-27. For another qualified liberal approach to reproductive rights, see Laura Purdy, Reproducing Persons (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1996). Purdy agrees with lawyer John Robertson that choice is the main principle that should guide policy on reproductive technol ogy. Yet she notes that new options can come to be accepted as the standard of care, that women may then choose options that are not really in their best interest, and that what may benefit one woman may harm other women or women as a class (225). One feminist theologian who stressed the impor tance of social constraints on technologically enhanced reproductive choice a decade ago is Janice Raymond, who noted, "When surrogacy is valorized as an individual woman's right to control her own body, it ignores these relations among women, that is, it ignores what happens when one woman's claim to control her own body results in women as a group-especially economically and racially disadvantaged women-being treated as breeders for others. When a woman's right to do whatever she wants to do with her body is valorized as feminism, feminism is stripped of its collective content and becomes little more than an individual woman's ability to adapt herself to the bourgeois image of the self-centered man."

The closely allied notion of autonomy is also a foreign concept in cultures in which "decision-making is a collective endeavor undertaken in the context of relationships": "The concepts of individual decision-making and individuals' control over their own bodies appear strange in many cultures, where decisions are made by other family members, by the family as a group, or by a larger community."9 Given that many cultures do not regard women as having ab solute equality with men in the first place, the idea that women should have a right of self-determination apart from family and communal needs is far from universal. Wertz's position on sex selection-a practice that Western feminists disap prove of with virtual unanimity10-nicely illustrates the tension between re spect for cultural pluralism and a perceived need to draw at least some moral lines. Wertz grants that many or most geneticists and counselors around the world (trained largely in liberal traditions of respect for informed consent) per mit women to choose sex selection. She is able sympathetically to present ar guments on both sides. Yet Wertz concurs with Mahowald that sex selection in variably perpetuates sexist attitudes toward and social denigration of women.1 Likewise, Dena Davis, a Jewish feminist, passes a negative judgment on even a relatively innocuous case of preconceptual sex selection: the choice of a girl in a fairly gender-equal society, when a mother deeply wants to raise a daugh ter in addition to several sons. At the very least, says Davis, sex selection pro motes gender stereotyping and encourages parents to invest heavily in and try to control having a child with specific types of characteristics.12 Yet, especially in the gender-unequal societies in which sex selection is most in demand, according to Wertz, laws against sex selection are often inef fectual in the face of strong social pressures to bear a child of a given sex, usu ally male. Wertz's favored approach to the problem is not to focus on the en actment of absolute prohibitions but gradually to establish a "moral climate" in 8 Ibid., 1414-15. 9 Ibid., 1417. 10 For a cautious approach to sex selection that raises questions for both sides but does not condemn the practice, see Bonnie Steinbock, "Sex Selection-Not Obviously Wrong," Hastings Center Report 32, no. 1 (2002): 23-28. 1 See also Jonathan M.

The key is "to promote education for women and equality in the workforce," because societies place higher value on women when they engage in "productive" work outside the home. In develop ing nations, the ratio of women to men as well as women's longevity "directly parallel women's participation in the workforce."'3 Therefore, the solution to sex selection in nations like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh lies in the educa tion and employment of women. Wertz's approach represents an emerging postliberal but nonrelativist turn in feminist bioethics, a turn from a more theory-oriented and programmatic defense of rights to a more practical, dialectical, and intercultural discernment of norms and normative practices that can benefit women across a variety of cultural experiences. Most would agree with Susan Sherwin that feminist bioethics can develop "global visions" in "a multicultural world" only by taking in the bias-correcting perspectives of "differently situated persons."'4 Yet Sherwin also rightly makes the point that all bioethicists, including feminists, "must find the conceptual tools we need to chisel a measure of unity within our diversity so that we may shape a global bioethics strong enough to generate just public policies."l5 Balancing different perspectives and shared goals is a con tinuing task for feminist bioethics as it addresses emerging genetic options and practices. Feminist Theology, Bioethics, and Genetics What distinctive perspective does feminist theology bring? The still-grow ing literature on genetics here can be set against the larger picture of theology, feminist theology, and feminist theological bioethics. To speak theologically means to set human experiences and concerns against a horizon of ultimacy, in which the human is relativized and the transcendent evoked. Jews and Chris tians name the transcendent source and destiny of all being "God" and employ anthropomorphic, especially parental, images to communicate the personal na ture of this divine power. Symbols of creation, sin, and grace define human ex istence as finite and dependent; for Jews, Christians, and Muslims, as good, purposeful, and accountable to a higher source of human being; as prone to selfish, arrogant, and short-sighted rationalization of disordered, irresponsible behavior; and as called to repentance and renewed trust, in hope of the fulfill ment of a promise of reconciliation and healing. For believers of all religious traditions, individual spiritual experience is interdependent with a community 13 Wertz, "International Perspectives," 1435. 14 Susan Sherwin, "Moral Perceptions and Global Visions," Bioethics 15, no. 3 (2002): 179. 15 Susan Sherwin, "Feminist Reflections on the Role of Theories in a Global Bioethics," in Globalizing Feminist Bioethics: Crosscultural Perspectives, ed.

For Christians especially, human suffering can be subsumed into the redemptive presence of God in history if united with the ever-mysterious and ambiguous symbol of God's own presence in human suffering, the cross of Jesus Christ. Human ethical behavior in his torical communities carries vital religious significance, because through it hu mans fulfill their calling "to love God and neighbor" (according to the love command in the book of Deuteronomy and all four Gospels). Theology com prises not only views about the divine and about humans in relation to God, but also of humans in relation to one another and in society. The import of Christian symbols for ethics, including bioethics, is not di rect or unambiguous, however.'6 These symbols underwrite a sense of humil ity and caution, as well as a sense of responsibility and initiative for humans as made "in the image of God." They demand communal identity and accounta bility but also accentuate the radical value of every individual created, saved, and called by God. They idealize human action in imitation of divine mercy and forgiveness, yet call for judgment upon evil and wrongdoing, out of respect for God's own righteousness. They urge that some suffering be accepted as in evitable to human existence, yet call humans to participate in the healing of evil by God's redemptive presence. The selection of relevant images to bring to bear on any moral or social problem is dependent in great part on a constellation of factors in the discern ment process. Clarity and consistency in the conclusions drawn are more likely when religious symbols are invoked to deal with fundamental and recurring human situations and realities, such as life and death, war and peace, the rela tion of parent to child, and sexual relations and commitments. Yet, although basic values such as the value of life, the evil of violence and killing, the bond of parental love, and the goodness of marriage can be affirmed, the way they are observed and concretely lived out has obviously been a matter of ongoing discernment and sometimes deep disagreement over the centuries. Theologi cal ethics today recognizes that discernment is a process, and one that needs constant correction in light of religious experience, biblical and theological symbols, and changing human realities. Feminist theology is committed to a bias in favor of women and women's experience in the reading of religious symbols, the renewal of religious prac tices, the interpretation of human relationships, and the reform of human so 16 Audrey R. Chapman recognizes the difficulties that attend the movement from religious themes and symbols to specific recommendations, but she still believes religious thinkers should de velop "middle axioms" to make clearer connections between orientation and action.

Feminist theology begins from the radical experiences of women's suf fering and desire for wholeness; acknowledges that the oppression of women has been reinforced by uses of religious symbols that privilege men and subor dinate women; and employs a subversive and reconstructive hermeneutic of religion to defend women's dignity in the light of a reading of creation, sin, and redemption that is more authentic both to the best of the tradition and its scriptures and to women's experiences. Feminist theology is always political and always, therefore, a form of the ological ethics. An originally white, academic feminist theology has become more pluralistic and cross-cultural, transformed by many ethnic and racial ex periences, including womanist, mujerista, and Asian American theologies in the United States alone. It has also become more radically committed to dis tributive justice and the battle against racism, sexism, classism, and discrimi nation on the basis of sexual orientation. Accordingly, forms of politically com mitted theology, especially by women, have become more difficult to classify as specifically "feminist" or not. In this article I will therefore employ a rather loose definition of feminist theology (especially in the context of genetic ethics), as comprising a variety of writings, mostly by women, that either are concerned with women's specific interests or extend the bias in favor of women to a bias in favor of the disenfranchised. There are few specific questions in bioethics and genetics on which there is unanimity among feminist theologians (or theologians in general, for that matter), with the possible exception of sex selection. What does emerge as a general consensus is the importance of mak ing, with liberation theology, an "option for the poor" in evaluating gene-based diagnostics and interventions. Margaret Farley and Barbara Andolsen have set some general directions for feminist theology and bioethics. In 1985, in "Feminist Theology and Bioethics," Farley grounded feminist theology in the experience and well being of women, and lifted up three central themes: human relational patterns, human embodiment, and human interpretation of "nature."17 Farley insists that patterns of relationship not be hierarchical and oppressive, especially to women; that women can reclaim their bodies as personal subjects active in the world; and that the domination of nature that goes along with the domination of women can be overcome in the name of a sacramental view of creation. Im portant interdependent principles for Farley are autonomy and relationality, equality, and mutuality. Raising an issue that has become increasingly impor tant in the years since this essay was published, Farley resists saying that all women's experience is essentially the same, but she still holds out for a femi 17 Margaret A.

Shelp (Dordrecht, Netherlands: Reidel, 1985), 163.</page><page sequence="9">Cahill: Genetics, Ethics, and Feminist Theology 61 nist epistemology that allows the judgment that "past interpretations of women's reality were simply wrong."18 Andolsen gives special attention to issues of race and class, observing that ultimately feminist theology is concerned about "the well-being of all persons, including men, and about the good of the entire natural world."'9 In accor dance with her interest in the intersection of race and class with gender, An dolsen corrects a theory of justice as detached impartiality with an ethic of care sensitive to the particular circumstances and forms of oppression suffered by women and others. Seeking to jar religious sensibilities into a new way of see ing the relation between the divine and the world, she suggests a reinvigorat ing use of the image of God as Mother, both to empower women as patients and health-care practitioners and to foster a belief in "the God/dess who will tolerate no excluded ones."20 Reflecting Andolsen's interest in connecting bioethics with oppressive institutions, feminist theologian Mary Hunt borrows a term from Elisabeth Schiissler Fiorenza-kyriarchy-to name the "inter locking structures of domination that include racism, economic injustice, het erosexism, ageism, discrimination on the basis of physical differences and the like."21 Feminist theology brings to the dialogue with science "a sense of ur gency and accountability in a violent culture."22 Setting a framework specifically for issues of genetics, Maura Ryan pre dicts that the feminist voice will be "rich and varied," though always commit ted to the well-being of women and the eradication of gender discrimination, as well as "women's collective efforts to guarantee full and equal participation in social, political and economic life."23 Even the protection of autonomy and bodily integrity in the new "age of the genome" will have to go beyond oppo sition to violations of reproductive liberty; it will require resistance to all con ditions that create "forced choices," for example, the stigmatization of genetic disorders and lack of support for disabled persons and their families.24 Under such conditions, genetic testing leads to employment and insurance discrimi nation, as well as pressure to terminate pregnancies. Genetic testing can also 18 Ibid., 174. 19 Barbara Hilkert Andolsen, "Elements of a Feminist Approach to Bioethics," in Feminist Ethics and the Catholic Moral Tradition, ed. Charles E.

Ryan proposes three theological-ethical themes as special loci of the fem inist contribution: common good, embodiment, and stewardship.25 First, the rights of individuals can ultimately be protected only if rights and responsibil ities are correlated with the common good. Genetic technologies can be pow erful tools in the battle against human suffering, but they will contribute to the conditions that all people require for flourishing only within contexts of which basic needs like food, shelter, and fair labor are also a part. Second, following Margaret Farley, Ryan calls for feminists to integrate the body with subjectiv ity, personhood, and social conditions, even while recognizing some "biological givens." Ryan raises the possibility that there are some "shared, inescapable re alities of human finitude" and warns against handing the body over completely to the genetic manipulators. As in the case of assisted reproduction, feminists may find it difficult finally to decide the line between those interventions de manded by justice and compassion, and those that are excessive and oppressive to women. Finally, a feminist ethic of stewardship for genetics envisions "a pro visional openness to the use of genetic intervention to address human suffer ing," yet with respect for the concrete reality of all persons and vigilance against both arrogance and indifference.26 Feminist Theology, Genetics, and Reproduction Many feminists have been concerned with the impact on women of the new forms of assisted reproduction and of new types of prenatal and preim plantation genetic testing. For theologians and others, women's self-determi nation is a major principle in the ethics of reproduction. In general, feminist theologians view reproductive technologies as enabling women's choices about pregnancy and motherhood. However, few see them as unqualified goods. Most are well aware of the coercive effects of such options on women; some are also concerned with the instrumentalization of embryos, fetuses, and chil dren; and an increasing number are alarmed at the social cost of new tech nologies and their potential to exacerbate natural and social inequities of birth. In regard to the newest innovations of cloning and stem-cell research, concerns about reproduction and the embryo take a different turn, as questions of dis tributive justice in the allocation of research funds and access to promised therapies become predominant. I will first consider feminist theological re 25 Ibid., 97-100. 26 Ibid., 100.</page><page sequence="11">Cahill: Genetics, Ethics, and Feminist Theology 63 sponses to new reproductive technologies and their genetic aspects, then turn in the next section to cloning and stem-cell research, as I develop the commit ment of feminist theologians to distributive justice in genetics. Among theologians, Catholic women seem to have been more prolific in addressing the new reproductive technologies, probably because they belong to a church with an unusually vocal and dogmatic teaching authority-one which has frequently been associated with positions on gender and reproduc tion that assign women to domestic and maternal roles, even while narrowly limiting legitimate means to achieve pregnancy. For example, a 1987 statement from the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith prohibited any technology that destroys embryos or even achieves conception outside the human body, whether with the sperm and egg of a married couple or by means of donor gametes.27 Protestant and Jewish women have had no such authorita tive body against which to react, and have tended cautiously to follow the cul tural trend to view such technologies as medical measures in the battle against infertility.28 Writings by Catholic women in the late 1980s took aim, first of all, at the idea that "artificial" conception was immoral even for a married couple using their own gametes.29 Margaret Farley granted provisional acceptance to technologies such as artificial fertilization as aiding "just and responsible pro creation" if it was safe, was conducive to the development of the child, and met criteria of distributive justice.30 More recently, Maura Ryan has developed the economic criterion from a feminist and theological standpoint, pressing the larger question of whether and when the intensive use of technology serves the real interests of women.3' Weaving together resources from law, medicine, theology, and first-person in fertility accounts (including her own), Ryan skillfully nuances a judicious argu ment that infertility therapies should be viewed as reasonable medical reme dies. Yet they can also reinforce women's "desperation" in the face of coercive 27 Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, "Instruction on Respect for Human Life in Its Origin and on the Dignity of Procreation: Replies to Certain Questions of the Day" (Donurn vitae), Origins 16, no. 40 (1987): 697-711. 28 See, for example, Karen Lebacqz, ed., Genetics, Ethics, and Parenthood (New York: Pil grim, 1983). 29 See, for example, Eileen P.

From the standpoint of relief of suffering as a goal of medicine, Ryan observes that the suffering caused by illness goes beyond the physical to include psychosocial dimensions, and that this is particularly acute for the infertile. Both men and women see themselves "not as having imper fect or malfunctioning bodies, but as having spoiled identities."32 Although medical treatment can play into the very ideologies that cause such reactions, bioethics must be realistic about "the ends of medicine." Medicine can prima rily address only the physical causes of infertility; in cases in which those can not be overcome, a person will need to rely on other personal and social re sources to resolve the suffering of infertility. And although medicine as such cannot resolve every social issue, it is still part of a social climate that may need transformation so that infertility may be more adequately "defined, lived, min istered to, and potentially transcended."33 If medical responses to infertility are to be effective, they often require in novative means of accomplishing conception. Increasingly it is becoming med ically feasible and socially acceptable to reach beyond the physical contribu tions of a "conceiving couple" in order to do so. Not only can conception itself occur under laboratory conditions, but also third, fourth, and even fifth parties can come into play in the form of sperm donors, ovum donors, and "surrogate mothers," who contract to gestate fetuses and sometimes to contribute ova as well. One useful part of Ryan's study is her discussion of the relative weight of the biologically based aspects of parenthood and those aspects that involve af fective and emotional ties and social and personal commitment. Although the latter aspects are more definitive of human relationships in general, Ryan rec ognizes that the former are also relevant, though not decisive (e.g., in cases of adoption). Rather than trying to minimize either side of parenthood, she ac knowledges that a right balance is important but not easy to find, and must be tailored to different kinds of circumstances. Ryan pursues the justice aspects of reproductive technologies in the con text of the common good by first defining parenthood as a form of social par ticipation, the basic conditions of which society has some duty to provide. Health is a "capacity for acting in the world, for pursuing vital goals."34 Even though women's life goals cannot be reduced to motherhood, bearing children may still be considered a basic human capacity that some legitimately desire to realize and that can integrate those engaging in it into important social rela tionships.35 However, the right to advanced infertility services is not defensible if it compromises the access of others to basic health needs, or if it maintains 32 Ibid., 71. 33 Ibid., 78. 34 Ibid., 132. '35 Ibid., 82.</page><page sequence="13">Cahill: Genetics, Ethics, and Feminist Theology 65 the privilege of some by disadvantaging others. Infertility treatment ought to be funded on an equitable basis, which will require placing some limits on the types of treatments available by combining considerations of cost and likely ef fectiveness in view of the particular circumstances of the patient. For example, patients could be required to try less costly measures first, and limits could be placed on the number of times certain treatments should be used. Finally, Ryan turns to the resources of faith communities in searching for a spirituality that can contend constructively with the problem of infertility, at both an individual and a communal level. The inability to bear children is not a problem with which most religious traditions have dealt well, in their por trayal of barrenness as a curse and fertility as a blessing from God. More recognition could be given to adopting parents and infertile "hopeful parents" in community liturgies, and special liturgies could be developed to mourn both infertility and pregnancy loss, as well as to mark the end of "aggressive infer tility treatment."36 A "transformative spirituality" will be built not on "the ex pectation of miracles" but on "the constant companionship of God in the ex perience of infirmity, disappointment, or despair." Communities of faith need not deny reality but can become sites where "transcendent hope" can be wit nessed and "the capacity to trust that all things, even our present sufferings, are working to good can be learned."37 A recent dissertation by Elisabeth Brinkmann probes similar possibilities by reaching into the Christian past for creative alternatives to liberal, radical, and care-based feminist approaches to reproductive technologies. Brinkmann draws parallels between medieval women who suffered because the birthing female body was construed as deficient by their culture, and modern women who suffer because infertility is construed as a deviation from the womanly norm of motherhood. She shows how medieval women reinterpreted bodily functions such as menstruation and lactation to overcome the characterization that they were "defective and misbegotten" and to identify instead with the suf fering, bleeding, and "feeding" body of the crucified Christ. Similarly, contem porary women can avoid the unsatisfying ethic of control proposed by modem infertility medicine, and integrate their suffering "into a life of generativity in which the finite and transcendent aspects of human existence are balanced." The limits of infertility can be transcended "through loving service to others," perhaps adoption and family building or perhaps other social commitments.38 In vitro fertilization, combined with advances in genetic analysis, has made it possible (whether in the context of infertility or not) to select embryos with certain characteristics. Originally performed to avoid gene-based diseases and 36 Ibid., 159. 3' Ibid., 163. 38 Elisabeth Brinkmann, Embracing the Deficient Body: Alternative Responses to Infertility (Ann Arbor: UMI Dissertation Services, 2001), 159.</page><page sequence="14">66 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion abnormalities, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PIGD) can also be used to further preferences for identifiable "normal" traits. The inequitable social im plications of this prospect are only too evident, as those with more income have access to greater levels of both "medically indicated" and elective genetic in tervention. A number of books edited by European authors help to enlarge the per spective on social and policy analysis of reproductive technologies, PIGD, and other genetic issues while placing them in the context of feminist concerns.39 Though not always specifically oriented by theological questions, many of the contributors have backgrounds in theology or work partly in the context of re ligious studies.40 As the authors of an annotated bibliography note, many fem inists resist the subtle control of procreation through criteria that are formu lated in terms of genetic health but are defined by social more than scientific norms. These authors also connect international population control with the medicalization of procreation.41 Europeans, perhaps more than North Americans, are concerned with the social and medical ideologies that predetermine "free choice." According to the German bioethicist Regine Kollek, genetic technologies are loaded with symbolic meanings, which she interprets in terms reminiscent of Michel Fou cault's analysis of power in relation to sex and sexuality. In the phenomenon of "individualization" that has occurred in postindustrial societies since World War II, individuals leave traditional belief systems and structures of power and 39 Interdisciplinary representation of European authors is offered in Elisabeth Hildt and Sigrid Graumann, eds., Genetics in Human Reproduction (Aldershot, England: Ashgate, 1999); Hille Haker and Deryck Beyleveld, eds., The Ethics of Genetics in Human Procreation (Aldershot, England: Ashgate, 2000); Maureen Junker-Kenny, Designing Life?

Yet, rather than being "autonomous," the individual experiences "new forms of social entrenchment and control": In developed democratic societies, however, this control is not ex erted by external authorities; instead dominant rules are internal ized and become effective from within, apparently based on free and autonomous decisions. The relevant question therefore is, which rules guide modem forms of procreation, where do they come from, to which social and cultural context do they relate, and what kind of function do they have?42 Kollek registers the point that people in Western societies perceive themselves to have a high degree of control over their personal lives, but this also height ens the expectation of greater individual accountability and responsibility: "The new genetic and reproductive technologies are therefore a perfect match for modern, individualised life styles that are characterised by the need as well as the desire to plan and to structure the course of one's own life rationally and in accordance with the requirements of modern living."43 Genetic Options and Justice: Enhancement, Cloning, Stem Cells Three of the more controversial emerging applications of genetics are ge netic enhancement, cloning, and stem-cell research. These applications help pose three interrelated issues in contemporary bioethics that are of great in terest to feminist theologians: the meaning of "human nature," the ideal of so cial justice, and the possibility of moral discourse and agreement across cul tural boundaries. All three applications of genetic knowledge push the limits of what so far has been understood to be "normal" in biomedicine, with cloning and enhancement offering to alter radically the degree of control humans have over their own nature and destiny. Related issues are eugenics and the instrumentalization of life, including even very early forms of human life. As Liz Hepburn, an Australian theologian, notes, a religious concern about the most vulnerable members of society should sensitize us to the dangers of wholesale eradication of "undesirable" genes in a quest for perfection.44 All embryo research is against the law in Ger many, reflecting public sensitivity to the horrors of Nazi medicine. The right of self-determination of those seeking counseling is affirmed but with a herme neutic of suspicion against the coercive and "normalizing" effects of the testing and counseling process. Not to be forgotten is the gap between knowledge and 42 Regine Kollek, "Technicalisation of Human Procreation and Social Living Conditions," in Haker and Beyleveld, Ethics of Genetics, 140. 43 Ibid., 143,157. 44 Liz Hepburn, "Parental Autonomy or Acceptance of Limits?" in Junker-Kenny and Cahill, Ethics of Genetic Engineering, 35-42.</page><page sequence="16">68 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion the possibility of effective intervention.45 In Europe, especially Germany, the rights and protection of affected embryos and fetuses is a concern for some feminist theologians,46 as is the implicit devaluing of "impaired life."47 Such a prospect reminds theologians of Reinhold Niebuhr's insight that it is human destiny to be both finite and free, and it is human nature to attempt to mo nopolize advantages for the sake of oneself and one's group. Setting boundaries for "human nature" in the face of new genetic free doms seems almost impossible. Feminist and other theologians resort to metaphors to communicate hopes, fears, and caveats that seem to escape the categories of pure reason. Few feminists have tried to define human nature ab solutely, but they have improved upon some of the metaphors for the human reality and human agency in the technological age. A major agenda item in the process is social justice, as has already been amply demonstrated. To move to ward more just uses of genetics, dialogue and discernment across cultural groups, societies, and regions is vital. Feminists are finding metaphors for "human being" that may speak across cultures and that are "political" in the sense of trying to expand the boundaries of inclusive community. Mary Rosner and T. R. Johnson diagnose a tendency of metaphors associ ated with the HGP to cast researchers as those who conquer and exploit, "whether they claim to interpret the ultimate 'book,' to fix a flawed 'machine,' or to map a mysterious 'wilderness.'"48 Celeste Condit and Deirdre Condit want to replace the familiar "blueprint" metaphor for the human genome with a more dynamic and creative "recipe" metaphor.49 They acknowledge, how ever, that metaphors work in social contexts and that one danger of their pro posal is that it could encourage associations with cooking in the home and nur turing, thus making the public even more receptive to the introduction of genetic technologies. Some religious advocates of human genetic intervention, especially Ger man Catholic theologian Karl Rahner and American Lutheran theologians Ted Peters and Phillip Hefner, have used the metaphor of the human person as "co-creator" or "created co-creator" with God to advance a similarly benign picture of human genetic opportunities and freedoms. The co-creator 45 Graumann and Mandry, "Ethics of Medical Genetics," 114. 46 See, for example, theologians Dietmar Mieth, "Bioethics, Biopolitics, Theology" (6-22); Helga Kuhlman, "Crisis Pregnancies in the Age of Human Genetic Diagnosis: Women's Right to Self-Determined Pregnancies and the Right of the 'Other'" (93-111); Hille Haker, "Ethical Reflec tions of Genetic Counseling in Prenatal Diagnosis" (112-29); and Maureen Junker-Kenny, "Em bryos in Vitro, Personhood, and Rights" (130-58), all in Junker-Kenny, Designing Life? 47 Graumann and Mandry, "Ethics of Medical Genetics," 114. 48 Mary Rosner and T.

The driving concern behind the metaphor seems to be throwing off irrational restraints of tradition and allowing religion to endorse those aspects of scien tific investigation which promise significant benefits for human health and happiness. Maureen Junker-Kenny objects that metaphors of divinely aligned creativity seem to legitimate much while offering few criteria for the responsi bility and proper ends of scientists.50 Another alternative metaphor with appeal to many feminists is Donna Haraway's "cyborg," a technologically altered human self-creation, part nature and part machine, that challenges the "binary opposition" between maker and product that the blueprint, map, text, machine, recipe, and even co-creator metaphors seem to suppose.51 Rosner and Johnson believe that the cyborg avoids "pure progressivism" by "continuously deferring final and ultimate an swers and rescuing a space for mystery, reverie, and awe" and by "transgress ing boundaries."52 Estonian theologian Anne Kull sees potential in the image to overcome culturally authorized concepts of "nature" and to recognize that "definitions of nature, society, religion, politics, technology, and science are all produced together": "In (feminist) cyborg discourse, emergence replaces tele ology; distributed cognition replaces autonomous will, embodiment replaces a body seen as a support system for the mind, and a dynamic partnership be tween human and nonhuman beings (including intelligent machines) replaces the liberal humanist's manifest destiny to dominate and control nature."53 Cyborgian utopianism may help to overcome the hierarchical and solu tion-oriented mind-set of much genetic science and to imagine a changed human nature in a liberating light. But can it set effective limits on its more ex ploitative outcomes? Or does it, too, romanticize the liberating potential of ge netic technology with little recognition that self-constructing, boundary-break ing cyborgs of the posthuman genetic future may be the heirs of the formerly human wealthy classes, a generation that now dominates and exploits those for 50 Junker-Kenny, "Embryos in Vitro," 152. 51 Donna Haraway, "A Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science, Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980's," Socialist Review 15, no. 2 (1985): 65-108; and Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Rein vention of Nature (New York: Routledge, 1991). Much has been made of this metaphor in feminist bioethics literature.

Laurie Zoloth reaches into the Jewish "world of the Talmud" to find metaphors that can set human creativity under God, allow for instances in which it justifiably transgresses the "natural," and indicate that a careful dis cernment process is required as knowledge is pursued toward practical out comes. She takes stories of magic, sorcery, and alchemy to provide metaphors for research in genetics. Although the rabbis permit some instances of magic, limits are set against worshiping a thing made or hawking the "elixir of life" in the marketplace. She endorses maximal freedom of research in order to learn, to explain, and to teach, but research must also "be held to the duty of jus tice."54 The centrality of considerations of justice in the ethics of genetics may be exposed by a further look at genetic therapy and enhancement, cloning, and stem-cell therapy, all of which challenge natural and genetic boundaries as we know them. Some maintain that fairly bright lines can be drawn between so matic cell therapy and germ-line therapy, and between genetic therapy and en hancement,55 whereas others recognize a shading from, say, the reinforcement of disease-resisting traits to the introduction of other improvements that do not address specific diseases directly. The latter group also questions why, if a change is for the better, it should not be passed on to offspring, if and when safety criteria are met. It is harder to deal with economic inequities, however, given that the development of these techniques "by the private sector on a for profit basis means that they will be beyond the means of many citizens, mak ing them available only to a narrow, wealthy segment of society."56 Like genetic screening to avoid disease, the development of measures to treat disease and to pass beyond normal functioning "is particularly a problem in a country like the United States, which has a long and disturbing history of drawing sharp dis tinctions among citizens on the basis of race and ethnicity and where many persons harbor beliefs in biological determinism."57 Similar concerns arise about cloning. Most theologians, feminists in cluded, take a cautious approach to the cloning of a human being to create an other person who is virtually identical genetically. It is a radical change in the nature of human reproduction, it contains the danger of excessive control over 54 Laurie Zoloth, "Reasonable Magic and the Nature of Alchemy: Jewish Reflections on Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research," Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal 12, no. 1 (2002): 88. 55 Patricia Taboada, "Human Genetic Enhancement: Is It Really a Matter of Perfection?

The most sympathetic case is the use of cloning as a form of reproductive technology for an infertile cou ple who would otherwise have to use a donor or remain without biologically re lated children, but most theological feminists remain dubious.58 In any event, the most imminent and hence hotly debated use of cloning techniques is not to create a baby but to derive stem cells from cloned embryos for research on regenerative therapies for disease. A recent collection edited by three feminist theologians, The Human Em bryonic Stem Cell Debate, presents the scientific, policy, and bioethical ramifi cations of stem-cell research.59 Although some of the chapters come from a re ligious perspective, others reflect feminist theological concerns in a less direct but still effective way, especially taking public-policy impact into account. In their introduction, Suzanne Holland, Karen Lebacqz, and Laurie Zoloth note that among the aspects of stem-cell research needing more consideration are the "profit and commodification of important parts of human living" and "the perennial and intractable issue of social justice and how to distribute the ben efits and burdens that will inevitably be associated with this research."60 Justice in health care has been a concern for both Zoloth and Lebacqz in previous works, and Lebacqz has raised important questions about the inequitable so cial ramifications of the funding and exploitation of the HGP. Both use biblical stories to indicate that a fair and righteous community is an inclusive one.61 The quality of public debate about stem-cell research is a newer sign of whether and how justice considerations are addressed. The status of the embryo has been important, even central, in the debate about stem-cell research. These three issues-the embryo, public debate, and justice-will be considered in turn. 58 For an overview, see Chapman, Unprecedented Choices, 77-124. See also Nancy J. Duff, "Seeing the Significant in the Factual," in Cole-Turner, Beyond Cloning, 84-96. Sondra Ely Wheeler makes the case that cloning is a distortion of the meaning of parenthood in "Contingency, Tragedy, and the Virtues of Parenting," in Cole-Turner, Beyond Cloning, 111-23. Abigail Rian Evans argues on the basis of the Reformed tradition that cloning is not necessary, is reductionistic, under mines the family, and encourages idolization of technology, in "Saying No to Human Cloning," in Cole-Turner, Beyond Cloning, 25-34. On the other side, Dena Davis argues philosophically from Jewish traditions that cloning can be an acceptable way to produce a loved child.

Catholic theologian Margaret Farley sees the point of individuation as more important than conception in establishing significant respect and protective status for the embryo. Karen Lebacqz and philosopher Francoise Baylis debate what respect might mean in the case of an entity not considered to be fully human or a person. Lebacqz argues the position that some living things can be respected even if destroyed; Baylis takes issue with the version of that position adopted by the National Bioethics Advisory Com mission to permit embryonic stem-cell research, saying that respect means ap preciation of an entity for what it is in its own right and precludes destruction for any other ends. Laurie Zoloth weights the obligation to seek human well being and healing much more heavily than the need to protect the embryo from harm.63 Margaret McLean represents a thread that runs through the volume, and a pervasive concern in feminist theological analysis of genetics as a whole, when she voices concern that, "given our country's growing economic divide and the fact that private companies are funding the leading edge of biotech nology, it seems likely that, left undisturbed, stem cell technology will be avail able to some but not all. This portends further stratification of human health and well-being within the richest country in the world." She proposes an ethic based on "fairness of access" to new technologies, taking into account the "so cial lottery" that affects "the weaker members of society, especially children and those left poor in money, health, and access."64 Suzanne Holland adds that new technologies on sale to elites will further limit women's decision-making capacity and exploit their bodies, as ova are commercialized and the poor largely females and people of color-are excluded from therapeutic benefits.65 In an article published elsewhere, Holland suggests that even reproductive cloning for benevolent motives need not violate personhood, but its commod ification must be regulated. This is a task for which "vision" will be required, in order to avoid the undue influence of self-interest.66 62 Holland, Lebacqz, and Zoloth, introduction, xix. 63 Margaret A.

Her words recall those of the para ble of judgment in Matthew 25, where Jesus rewards with eternal life those who have served him as he was embodied in the hungry, thirsty, imprisoned, and sick. McLean sees it as imperative in the age of biotechnology that "we ex pand our moral imaginations to account for and be accountable to marginal ized persons and concern ourselves with the shaping of a just future. Power is to be exercised on behalf of the least of us today and for the seven generations to come."67 Laurie Zoloth, too, uses religious language and imagery to make similar points, with the difference that, as a Jewish ethicist, her ethical orien tation is more communal and less explicitly grounded in natural norms of human dignity or a cross-cultural common good. Beginning with the story of the Exodus to argue that a community must define itself in terms of an iden tity centered on ideals and goals for the future, Zoloth broadens her audience to the whole American public by alluding to the social commonwealth created by the Mayflower Compact of 1620. Zoloth calls for both procedural justice in the form of inclusive public debate and decision making, and substantive jus tice in the shape of access to health care for "the freed slaves, the widow and the orphan, the stranger, the pilgrim traveler, the refugee, [and] the unin sured."68 Holland, Lebacqz, and Zoloth's collaborative work is a promising contri bution to feminist theology and to a variety of issues in genetics, because it opens contacts between religiously based justice concerns and public discourse from a variety of perspectives about health care and medical research. Public debate on this and other reproduction-related issues of the new genetics some times seems to be caught in an impasse between the value of embryos; the rights of women, entrepreneurs, and consumers; and the promised benefits of stem-cell research "for all." The time is ripe for movement forward toward a moderate and cautious approach to stem cells and other biotechnology on the basis of distributive justice, an approach in which both feminist and religious ideals have important roles to play.69 67 McLean, "Stem Cells," 205. 68 Laurie Zoloth, "Jordan's Banks: A View from the First Years of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research," in Holland, Lebacqz, and Zoloth, Human Embryonic Stem Cell Debate, 237. 69 See, for example, the Journal of Medicine and Philosophy 24, no. 3 (1999), a special issue on the commodification of health care.

Crysdale fears that con sumerism, not religious or ethical reflection, "will drive the future of genetic research and technology."70 A feminist theological justice perspective must be attuned to the fact that "we" who consume are the privileged few and that elites govern public debates about genetics, including the process of defining the important scientific and moral questions. To reverse this situation, Karen Lebacqz examines the issue of genetic pri vacy in light of the "epistemological privilege" of the poor ("anyone who is ei ther economically disadvantaged or politically and socially disenfranchised"), which she sees as a biblical mandate.7' Those who have limited employment and insurance choices may have the legal right to refuse genetic testing or the release of results, but release of medical records is often mandatory for educa tion and employment. Moreover, populations that have suffered discrimination have every reason to fear that testing may lead to further stigmatization and ex clusion: "Precisely because the genetic issue has been 'privatized' and seen as a matter of 'personal' decision making in a counseling setting, the values un derlying that setting go unexamined. These values-the values supporting medical services-do not always meet the needs of the poor, nor do they re flect the values of oppressed communities."72 This observation is given eloquent testimony by the silence on the wonders of the HGP by African American theologian Emilie Townes in Breaking the Fine Rain of Death, where Townes weaves a "womanist ethic of care" around urgent health-care needs of black Americans.73 Foremost among the problems she identifies are a very inadequate health-care delivery system for basic needs and the lack of an integrated approach to health that includes spiritual and psy Health Care: An International Conundrum" (paper presented at the University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden, April 2002), and "Stem Cells and Justice" (paper presented at the Korea Religion and Sci ence Workshop, Seoul, January 2002). These papers develop the relevance for theological bioethics of theories of ethics proposed by Michael Walzer, John Rawls, Norman Daniels, and Martha Nuss baum. Taking helpful elements from all, Lebacqz argues for an approach to justice that is both sub stantive and procedural, guaranteeing health care as a basic human good that deserves social support. 70 Cynthia S.

Genetics comes up in the context of diseases that par ticularly afflict African Americans, including low birth weights, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, breast cancer, asthma, and HIV/AIDS. Townes observes that, though genes can predispose one to certain conditions, multiple environmen tal factors come into play in causing disease. These include cultural determi nants of diet and the symbolism of food, environmental risks, social constraints or influences on behavior, and lack of access to early diagnosis and treatment.74 Finally, this womanist theologian's perspective on genetic intervention is part of a "lament" in which "the careless drive toward entitlement without re sponsibility" has resulted in an extremely unhealthy atmosphere for women and men who are unable to purchase health care.75 The solution is grassroots empowerment through movements for community-based health care-not more investments in biotech research and development aimed at profits to be earned from wealthy consumers. After presenting an overview of many aspects of the new genetics, Carol Tauer concludes similarly that "individual" choices often have consequences for the common good and that the social-justice principles of faith traditions forbid an elitist approach. The first step toward fair genetic policies is educa tional programs enabling broad participation and highlighting justice.76 The condition of public debate on stem-cell research is important, because bioeth ical matters that affect many in society deserve broad public discussion and public participation in setting policy. Such matters include the relative impor tance of the embryo and the prospective health benefits of stem-cell research, commodification of human health and life, inequities in access to health care, the public or private funding of scientific research, and the influence of the market in setting research agendas and standards. Broad discussion and participation have yet to happen, however. Paul Root Wolpe and Glenn McGee take issue with the way public debate on stem-cell research has been manipulated by the "expert bioethics" of "groups of highly skilled professionals who are deputized to identify and resolve moral con flict."77 Yet greater understanding, reasonable compromise, and public educa tion toward consensus are not out of reach. For these benefits to occur, bioethicists will need to assume a different role in public discussion, serving as 74 Ibid., 62-68. 75 Ibid., 151. 76 Carol A.

Mar garet McLean likewise hopes for meaningful public conversations that are "mutually informative, honest, thoughtful, broadening, and potentially trans formative." If they can "force reexamination of metaphysical questions con cerning the nature of human personhood, the extent of control over human life, and humanity's place in the natural world, among other issues, our time is well spent."78 The final outcome might indeed be a better organized and more comprehensive oversight body,79 but it needs to be preceded by a very differ ent kind of process than has been in place to date. Biomedical norms are formulated symbiotically with scientific and politi cal discourse, as has been evident in U.S. debates about whether to allow "re search cloning" to obtain stem cells while banning "reproductive cloning." Sci entific and economic interests play a major role in the erosion or evolution of norms, a role which Cathleen Kaveny thinks is often virtually "pre-pro grammed once a new technique appears on the market," as in the case of cloning to obtain stem cells. Religious traditions can contribute to the debates on health-care policy by introducing fundamental questions about the nature of the human person, illness and death, the physician-patient relationship, and information and informed consent.80 The search for new models of political participation that can allow a broad-based and more democratic resolution of the conflicts and quandaries of the new genetics is an increasingly important task, not only at the community and national levels, but also internationally.81 Finally, then, feminist theology brings to debates about genetics three dis tinctive commitments: as feminist, to seek grounding in women's experiences and needs without limiting moral concern to women; as theological, to set bio medical practices against a horizon of ultimacy that relativizes even the most grandiose and accomplished human projects; and as political, to engage social transformation toward inclusive community that privileges all the "poor" and aspires to a global vision. Applied to genetics, these three commitments do not result in clear, specific directives for practices or policy. But they can inform ethical debate. Above all, feminist theologians will be skeptical of claims that new scientific discoveries can radically change the human future for the better, 78 McLean, "Stem Cells," 199-200. 79 Cynthia B.

Cathleen Kaveny, "Genetics and the Future of American Law and Policy," in Junker Kenny and Cahill, Ethics of Genetic Engineering, 70. 81 A praxis-oriented, interdisciplinary, and dialogical approach to achieving consensus on uses of genetic knowledge, both locally and internationally, has been proposed by some nursing ethicists.

Feminist theologians will discern the re ality of structural evil in the memory of their own oppression, and hence will ask in whose interest genetic innovations are developed. Feminist theologians will view genetic testing, reproductive technologies, cloning, stem-cell re search, gene therapy, and especially genetic enhancements through the lens of a preferential option for the poor and in the context of a world in which the basic health needs of the majority have yet to be seriously addressed.</page></plain_text>
