<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ARTICLE Intratextuality: The Parts, the Wholes, and the Holes LOWELL EDMUNDS ALISON SHARROCK and HELEN MORALES, eds., Intratextuality: Greek and Roman Textual Relations. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000. Pp. xii, 363. ISBN 0-19-924093-0. "Relations" in the sub-title of this book looks as if it means the relations of two or more separately existing entities, as in "sexual relations" or "international relations." But it does not. "Intratextuality," Alison Sharrock explains in "Intratextuality: Texts, Parts, and (W)holes in Theory" (Ch. 1), which introduces the collection, starts with the hypothesis that "a text's meaning grows not only out of the readings of its parts and wholes, but also out of the relationships between the parts, and the reading of these parts as parts" (6-7). The subtitle, then, refers to the internal relations of single entities. The title as a whole might better have been Intratextuality in Greek and Roman Literature. Theory is Sharrock' s starting point, and she lays her theoretical cards on the table. I welcome both her approach and her frankness, though I am aware that there are many (I wonder what percentage of classicists) who will not share my feelings. David West said in his Presidential Address to the Classical Association in 1995: "My advice to the young would be to cast out theory, and get down to real work on the texts." "The job of the literary scholar is to point to what's there and give a historical explanation of it" (1995: 22- 23). This attitude is not confined to England. I have one further personal declaration, this time partly an apology, to make. In the year after the publication of the book which I am reviewing, I published a book in which I discussed many of the issues raised by Vergilius 50 (2004) 158-169</page><page sequence="2">Review Artide: Intratextuality 1 59 Sharrock and other contributors (Edmunds 2001a), and it is inevitable that I cite myself on these issues. Sharrock does not discuss, does not even mention, the two schools of thought to which many readers will think they are being alerted by the title of her introduction: deconstruction and hermeneutics. It is as if Ast and Schleiermacher had never conceived of the hermeneutic circle (for Ast: Flashar 1979: 28-29; Bowie 1997: 111]); as if Ingarden had never said "Every literary work is in principle incomplete," and Iser had never developed this thought in The Act of Reading (cited only as "e.g." at 32 n. 66; cf. Edmunds 2001a: 99-101). It is as if Paul de Man had never said that the goal of literary criticism is "to reveal the existence of hidden articulations and fragmentations within assumedly monadic totalities" (de Man 1979: 249). Her theoretical points of reference (but not of discussion) are a couple of essays by Roland Barthes and Barbara Johnson. With no anxiety of influence, with marvelous insouciance, Sharrock plunges into her own "philosophy of reading" (5). She speaks of "reading strategies of unity and fragmentation" (7), "ideology of reading practices" (10), "act of reading" (several times), "a nexus ... of readings" (27), "reading of itself' (32), "reading in a non-linear manner" (35), and "our readings" (38). In the end, however, it remains unclear what she thinks reading is. She does not distinguish between the cognitive, neurophysiologically based, act of reading, about which she sometimes seems to be speaking (cf. Johnson 2000: 610-12) and a reading such as one might publish. A reading in this latter sense is an artifact, perhaps constructed from several empirical readings. She never gives an account of the "act of reading." In ancient Rome, William Johnson shows (2000), it was an event, a performance. This kind of event continues up to the present. Recently, I heard David Raeburn read aloud parts of his translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses. Silent reading (the suggestion has been made several times) is mental performance. "The reader performs the meaning of the text" (Edmunds 2001a: 44; cf. the final pages of Edmunds 2001b).</page><page sequence="3">160 Lowell Edmunds Richard Martin, in "Wrapping Homer Up: Cohesion, Discourse, and Deviation in the Iliad'' (Ch. 2), proceeding from a valuable overview of current Homeric criticism (44-51), takes on an intratextual interpretation of Nestor's improbably garrulous (even for him) speech at II. 11.655-803. He shows that this notorious digression is grounded in the poem by the devices of framing, mis en abyme'and juxtaposition; further, that the paradigm Nestor offers Patroclus does not fit, and its not fitting is the point. M. is not the only one but the first one in this collection to state what I consider a crucial theoretical principle: not the text but the audience or reader is the locus of intratextual ity. He says: "such intratextual features as cohesion, continuity, and unity cannot be textually determined" (53; his emphasis). I have said the same about intertextuality (Edmunds 2001a: 154-57). Because M. is thinking of Nestor's speech in a performance (cf. 50-51), he refers to these intratextual features as flowing from "a speech- community's sense of appropriate, genre-bound behaviours" (still 53). Having brilliantly shown an ancient way of hearing a long- troublesome passage, I wonder if M. would go on to suggest that this way can become the modern reader's. Or would he leave his finding as an anthropological-historical fact? Ch. 3 is also concerned with digression. Helen Morales in "Sense and Sententiousness in the Greek Novels" poses the problem of a particular kind of digression in the Greek novel, the sententia. She begins by providing statistics and a classification. She then, following a heterogeneous theoretical program (70-71), talks about digression as gendered and Hellenocentric. Her most sustained discussion concerns Leucippe and Cleitophon 6.19.1-19 (80-84). She concludes with reflections on sententiae "as instruments of deferral, postponing the fulfillment of the reader's desires" (84). In a deleted paragraph of another review (Edmunds forthcoming) I complained of a certain contributor's use of the (undefined) concept of desire, and I take the opportunity to address ' A term from heraldry for a small shield set within a larger shield, first used metaphorically by André Gide to refer to a literary work's internal small-scale self-representation. Gide's idea was theorized by Dällenbach 1977.</page><page sequence="4">Review Artide: Intratextuality 161 the complaint now to M. Desire (with "lack") has become a shibboleth in a certain area of discussion in Classics (which is why those who use it feel no need to define it). The fact is that the unconverted or dull-witted (or whatever they want to call us) have no reason, in advance of clarification and persuasion, to believe that all desire is sexual and/or that sexual desire is the fundamental truth of human nature and/or that desire in this sense or something like this sense is what drives reading. In "Epic in the Middle of the Wood: Mise en Abyme in the Nisus and Euryalus Episode" (Ch. 4), Don Fowler concentrates on the opening and closing of this episode in relation to the opening and closing of the Aeneid as a whole. His demonstration of the intratextual relation of part to whole depends much on intertextual links with other poems, which he deploys with characteristic finesse. The opening of the episode is a "special instance of mise en abyme" metapoetic (Nisus figures the poet) as well as narrative (98). After aperture and closure, Fowler turns, in conclusion, to the middles of poems and offers intriguing reflections on the "essential experience of reading" which takes place in this area. F. on reading is an interesting strand in his intellectual biography. A decade or so ago, he asserted: "I am ... sure that hermeneutics is a dead end" (1993: 88). In 1999, he said: "In a sense texts are always interactive exhibits reconfigurable by readers in the hermeneutic process" (1999: 439). In the article here under review, he twice uses "hermeneutic" (103-104), and he invokes the concept of the hermeneutic circle (109), which in fact well describes his reading of the Nisus and Euryalus episode in relation to the poem as a whole. In his discussion of middles, however, he uses the image of the labyrinth (112) and holds, with aporistic despair (elsewhere enthusiasm: Fowler 1999: 441), that "any supposed difference that ends make is swamped by the massive quantitative preponderance of the middle" (113). Some may feel that his discussion of the Nisus and Euryalus episode, which falls somewhere in the middle of the Aeneid, has shown the opposite. Elena Theodorakopoulos in "Catullus 64: Footprints in the Labyrinth" (Ch. 5) takes the labyrinth of the poem as a principle</page><page sequence="5">162 Lowell Edmunds for its interpretation. Positing a labyrinthine poem and a corresponding crisis of confidence "in our own readerly and interpretative abilities" (118), T. gives herself the freedom to present five short more or less separate investigations, marked by sub-headings, of the difficulties. She does not present a reading of the poem, because a reading in any conventional sense has been ruled out, though it can be discerned that "poem 64 demands an intratextual reader" (134), i.e., one who is willing to re-read. For T.'s reader, the question arises of where, aside from the obvious bafflements of structure, the incoherence of the poem resides. T. quotes the description of Ariadne as a stone Bacchant (64.60-67) and observes: "The regularity and control of the grammar in this passages appears to present a perfect picture of enclosure, but the picture ... focuses on the lack of 'enclosure' in Ariadne's appearance" (121). Five sentences later, in a conclusion, T. states: "Where the frame gives way - as it does in Catullus' extremely unstable ekphrasis - the authorial voice is no longer grounded, can no longer be attributed to a single source" (121). T. has also referred to the "incoherent persona of Catullus the lover in other poems" (118). At the same time, T. is confident that she can discern "authorial intention." The ironical use of virtus in this poem "can only be a function of authorial intention" (137). To return to the "regularity and control of the grammar," who was the source of these features? Was it the authorial voice, as distinguished from the author? Is there a coherent author and an incoherent voice or persona? One is not quite sure where T. stands on these matters. The value of her chapter will lie in further thought about her various investigations. She has usefully applied Wiseman 1985, on reference to Jason and Medea at the trial of Caelius, to the opening of the poem (122-25). Her investigation of intertexts of the labyrinth in Homer, Homeric commentary, and Vergil, with theoretical inspiration from J.H. Miller, takes one into a metapoetical dimension of the poem (129-34) and thus into an on-going discussion of the ways in which poems carry their own ontologies with them (cf. conclusion of Edmunds forthcoming).</page><page sequence="6">Review Artide: Intratextuality 163 Andrew Laird in "Design and Designation in Virgil's Aeneid, Tacitus' Annals , and Michelangelo's Conversion of Saint РаиГ (Ch. 6) shows how intertextuality creates intratextuality (the two epics of Homer and the two halves of the Aeneid), and vice versa (the deaths of three authors in the Annals , similar to Petronius', suggests that Tacitus' Petronius might be an author, too and thus the author of the Satyricon). The dynamic applies also to the relation between discourse about images and the perception of those images (passages in the Acts of the Apostles and Vassari's description of Michelangelo's Conversion of Saint Paul). L.'s examples are well-presented and of great interest. His brief concluding theoretical reflections are equally valuable (166-70). The point which Martin made in passing (quoted above) L. develops somewhat more fully. "The perceived relation between part and whole is not a primary quality of a text. It is actualized by a reader, or more likely, a group of readers or hearers with a certain competence" (167), i.e., by "interpretative communities" (168, with citation of Fish 1980 in n. 45, where L. correctly observes that "Fish's model could in principle allow for readings from outside the academy." Contrast the alarmist view of Fish in Martindale 2003: 97.) Carole Newlands in "Connecting the Disconnected: Reading Ovid's FastfX Ch. 7) faces the Roman poem which presents the greatest challenge to intratextual reading. Already an expert reader of this poem (Newlands 1995), she has illuminating things to say about the two passages on Ino (3.849-76; 6.473-568), their interconnections, and the relation of Ino/Mater Matuta to the two other goddesses who share with her the feast day of June 1 1 , Fortuna and Concordia. Though N. makes opening gestures toward "fractured poetics" and lack of "stable authorial viewpoint" (175- 76), her cogent, confident reading suggests otherwise. After Newlands' chapter, one comes upon a one-page "Editorial Preface to Part II," of which the running head "Part I" (43-202) was an intimation. Part II will be about "wider intra/extratextual issues to do with the individual and the state, the (con)structure of the universe, and the philosophical tradition."</page><page sequence="7">164 Lowell Edmunds This formulation suggests that the editors have not agreed with contributors like Martin and Laird, who take the view that the intratextual is already a function of the extratextual - determined by "a speech-community's sense of appropriate, genre-bound behaviours" (Martin, 53); "actualized by ... a group of readers or hearers with a certain competence" (Laird, 167). Duncan Kennedy's "Making a Text of the Universe: Perspectives on Discursive Order in the De Rerum Natura " is the first chapter of Part II (Ch. 8). He quotes 1 .949-50 and says "we are being offered 'the text of the world'," and goes on to speak of Lucretius' Epicurus as "textualizing" the universe. It is not the case, however, that Lucretius conceives of the universe as a text (though the alphabet is sometimes an analogy for the atoms). Nor is it quite right to say that "the challenge for a work such as De Rerum Natura, with its totalizing claims, is ... to render all phenomena 'intratextual'" (206). The claim to explain everything is not a claim to include everything. Lucretius' poem is a laborious stop-gap for the invisibility of the fundamental structure of things: neque in lucem exsistunt primordia rerum (2.796). These demurrals of mine are perhaps removed - I have not yet read it - by the book on the same theme (Kennedy 2002), which appeared subsequently. In this chapter, K.'s demonstration of a rhetorical anthropomorphism at work in Lucretius' exposition of some basic features of Epicurean physics is most impressive. This anthropomorphism of course goes directly against atomic theory, and another anti-Lucretius seems to have been found in Lucretius. But, as K. shows, it is a matter of Lucretius' rhetoric. Jon Hesk's Ch. 9 ("Intratext and Irony in Aristophanes") is the first and only contribution to pursue an important implication of the principle (again cf. Martin and Laird) that the reader creates intratextuality. He takes some examples of Aristophanic irony, intratextually generated, and shows how different members of the audience might have perceived them - and this point is crucial - or might not have perceived them. "[T]he conditions of production and reception in democratic Athens may require us to replace current strategies of privileging either an 'ironic' intratextual</page><page sequence="8">Review Artide: Intratextuality 165 reading or 'straight' intratextual reading with a strategy which gives equal legitimacy to both" (242). To take this view is not to commit to indeterminacy or aporia à la Fowler. On the contrary, it is to contemplate "two or more complete and opposed readings without giving priority to either" (231). H.'s readings of the possible readings is dazzling and makes someone who once wrote on Acharnians (one of H.'s texts) feel as gullible as old Demos and as much in need of rejuvenation. Matthew Fox's starting point in "Dialogue and Irony in Cicero: Reading De Republica''' (Ch. 10) is the preface - dialogue structure of the individual books of this work. It creates "an ironic distance between the narrator and the figures of the dialogue" (274). His theoretical guide is Julia Kristeva's essay "Word, Dialogue, Novel" (265-67, 278-79). It is not the best one for an approach based on reading (Edmunds 2001a: 8-18), and F. is talking about "an ironic dynamic . . . found by reading different areas of the work together" (272). F. is torn between a text-based intentionalist interpretation and a reader-based non-intentionalist one which finds a distance between the dialogues and "any controlling authorial voice" (277). Finally F. raises the question of intentional ity and reaches a puzzling conclusion: "Cicero's vision of his own writing is of something that is not contained by strict boundaries of authorial control" (286). I think that this sentence means: Cicero intends the non-intentional, or willingly accepts it. Many of the contributors to this collection are citing theory which they have not digested. John Henderson has digested theory which he does not cite. In Ch. 1 1 ("The Life and Soul of the Party: Plato, Symposium "), his sentence, " 'Socrates' and co. are forever writing Plato," (293 and then, at intervals of ten pages, 303, 313), alludes (in a performance of intertextuality that will create an intratextuality) to two works of Derrida which are essential ( sit venia verbo ) to his approach: The Post Card from Socrates to Freud and Beyond (1987) and Limited Inc. (1988). The first, taking its cue from a thirteenth-century manuscript illustration which shows Plato dictating to a Socrates writing at a desk, puts into question the structure of communication which seems to underlie</page><page sequence="9">1 66 Lowell Edmunds the Platonic dialogue (and the Western philosophic tradition). The second, a response to John R. Searle in a controversy over speech act theory, argues that contexts are not totalizable and utterances are always iterable. These two works provide, then, the ammunition for H.'s reading of Plato's Symposium, the dialogue most complexly framed (or contextualized) and the one in which Socrates seems most fully present. H. does not, however, make the usual deconstructive move of beginning with some predictable trait of différance. Instead he offers a linear reading in which he stages (again one wants to speak in terms of performance) the precarious relation between the narration of the dialogue and its constructedness, the ever-threatened "invasion of the symposium with its frame" (318, cf. 323). After this implosion, what is left? Only Plato? Who now proves to have been written about by Aristodemus, Aristodemus' sources, and the speeches, including Socrates', for which the sources vouched. Or is Plato hoist on his own petard and is everything gone? I was not sure. In this collection one can see a new orthodoxy forming. It consists of two awkwardly related parts. One is the reader as the locus of meaning (cf. Fowler 1995; Most 1999: xiii; Kraus 2002: 6). The other is indeterminacy of meaning, instability of authorial voice, and the like. Some contributors to this collection appear to be making inferences from the second to the first: if indeterminacy in the text, then aporia in the reader. I would say that it is the other way around, if aporia, then perhaps indeterminacy. In any case, these two positions have different genealogies and neither historically nor conceptually do they constitute any kind of unit. An inconsistency between the two is that the theory of indeterminacy is easy while the theory of reading is difficult. As part proof of this assertion, I point to the failure of this collection, in which highly intelligent persons appeal again and again to reading, to extricate itself from the don't-ask-don't-tell policy on reading customary in Classics. The reader here is "we," not the royal (pace Laird, 162) but the pseudo-transhistorical "we," which spares thinking about the historical situatedness of one's own reading (Edmunds 2001a: 39-40). In passing, I observe that Hesk's</page><page sequence="10">Review Artide: Intratextuality 167 notion of two complete and opposed ancient readings might open the way to the notion of two complete readings, one ancient and one modern, i.e. the one I am offering, which are also opposed or different. Most of the contributions have something valuable to say. To some I shall be returning, and shall use them in teaching, too. Their value, however, usually has nothing to do with their theoretical proffers or gestures, which can sometimes cause vertigo (e.g., the proffer that Kristeva's intertextuality was founded in psychoanalysis, 326). Laird's chapter is an oasis of clarity. Unlike David West, however, I see here no reason to turn back to some earlier program of research. On the contrary, I exhort those who use theory, and still more those who want to do theory, to read theory. RUTGERS UNIVERSITY BIBLIOGRAPHY Bowie, Andrew. 1997.
