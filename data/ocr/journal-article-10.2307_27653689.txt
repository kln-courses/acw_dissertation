Edin Received: 22 February 2005 / Accepted: 12 February 2007 / Published online: 27 February 2007 ? Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007 Abstract A meaningful distinction can be made between functions and mere effects in biological systems without resorting to teleological arguments: (i) biological systems must cope with a multitude of problems or they will cease to exist; (ii) the solutions to these problems invariably depend on circular causal chains ("feedback loops"); and (iii) biological functions are attributes of elements in biological systems that have an effect which, by contributing to the correcting behavior of a feedback control system, assists in solving a biological problem. The analysis is applied to several biological systems. The proposed solution is discussed primarily in its relation to two popular approaches to the concept of biological function, i.e., the "causal role accounts" and the "selected effect accounts". Keywords Biological function Causal chains Teleology 1 Biological problems Biological systems must cope with a multitude of problems or they will cease to exist. For instance, biological systems must preserve a certain cellular osmolality and main tain their temperature and the intracellular hydrogen concentration (pH) within cer tain ranges. Similarly, biological systems must be able to transform chemical energy and distribute substrates for intracellular processes. As a final example, biological systems must either reproduce or achieve immortality. Problems or challenges to survival can be identified at every organizational level: the sub-cellular level (e.g., the appearance of highly reactive radicals such as O2 that may haphazardly modify proteins), the cellular level (e.g., failure to keep cell osmo lality within certain bounds), the tissue level (e.g., slowed down transport by diffusion B.

Hence, "challenge" and "problem" are used here to refer to any physical, chemical or environmental factor that jeopar dizes the future existence of an individual (or its genes). Feeding a newborn child, for instance, is a "biological problem" to which breastfeeding is one solution. Breastfeed ing depends crucially on tissues and endocrine mechanisms that exist in both males and females, yet no normal male nor every woman will ever lactate. Similarly, only a few humans will ever suffer massive hemorrhage and yet all humans have mechanisms that in a reasonable sense have the function to support life if a person would become dangerously hypovolemic. The biological problems which biologists consider in order to understand the workings of organisms are thus not limited to ones that individual organisms actually confront during their lifespan but also potential challenges. Paleontology teaches us that the great majority of biological systems ultimately fail to meet one or another of the many threats to their existence. Not only will each individual organism eventually die, but an estimated 99.9% of all species that ever existed on earth are extinct (Raup 1991). It is therefore not surprising that whether biologists study how biological systems handle specific challenges to their existence, or investigate phenomena without any known role in counteracting challenges, they take for granted that the objects of study have or have had a role with respect to a particular challenge to sustained existence. In other words, biologists acknowledge that many biological phenomena have a function, that is, a specific role to play with respect to one or several biological problems. Parts and behaviors of biological systems (i.e., "elements" in biological systems) have many effects, yet not all such effects are considered to be biological functions. Every biologist agrees, for instance, that a biological function of the heart is to add hydraulic energy to the blood. The heart is also an endocrine organ (de Bold et al. 2001) and its walls contain mechanosensitive nerve endings that have a function in the regulation of blood volume (Gupta et al. 1966). By contrast, other effects of the heart do not constitute biological functions, for instance, the time-varying electrical fields that can be measured with ECG and the characteristic "heart-sounds." Still, it may be asked whether such a distinction between effects and biological functions is sufficiently clear to be considered legitimate in a supposedly "hard" sci ence such as biology. Specifically, it may be asked whether biological functions can be identified without resorting to teleological explanations, that is, if can they be iden tified without assumptions about design and preconceived goals. Further, supposing that the answer to these questions is yes, it may be asked what sort of information is conveyed by attributions of functions to biological phenomena. The purpose of this article is to answer these questions by means of an analysis of the concept of biological function that is used within the field of physiology (the branch of biology that deals with the activities and functions of biological systems and the physical and chemical processes involved). 2 Biological systems A system is an aggregate of physical objects that interact causally. A minimal sys tem is depicted in Fig. 1. Biologists study biological systems, that is, systems that are parts of organisms. No definition of the concept of an organism (or living system) will be attempted here. It is, however, generally recognized among biologists that the ?} Springer</page><page sequence="3">Synthese (2008) 161:203-218 205 Flg. 1 An abstract system with one or several inputs and outputs defining or essential properties of organisms include active self-maintenance, that is, the ability to actively sustain itself in the face of a wide range of internal and external forces that threaten to destroy it, and reproduction (which may be seen as an aspect of self-maintenance). A biological system may comprise anything from an enzymatic chain in a cell or in an organelle to a single organelle, a single cell, a group of related cells, a tissue, an organ system, a whole organism, or even a group of organisms insofar as a group of organisms (e.g., a termite society) can be considered an organism. Biological systems are individuated by the biological problems they solve. A biological system is thus an aggregate of physical parts of an organism that solves or contributes to solving a biological problem (or set of biological problems). The "inputs" and "outputs" (each of which may be multiples) of a biological sys tem are typically instantiated by chemical substances delivered either via the body fluids (hormones) or at synapses (transmittors). (From now on, the qualification "bio logical" will usually be dropped.) A system may, for instance, be influenced by the concentration of a certain chemical compound within a certain cell, or a system may be influenced by activity originating in special sensory organs, such as the chemore ceptors that are involved in respiratory control. The output of a system comprises any effect that it brings about. Only a small subset of the output of a system is of interest to a physiologist or any other biologist, and an even smaller subset will be attributed functions as exemplified above with the heart. The recipient of the input and the producer of the output are invariably found at the organizational level of the cell or below whether or not the cell forms part of an aggre gate constituting a tissue (e.g., the contracting myocyte of the heart). They may be the very same part of a biological system (e.g., the same cell as with autocrine control and synaptic autoregulation), but often they are distinct, for instance, different cells or different tissues. Biologists often coalesce multiple levels of descriptions, e.g., in expressions such as "renal responses to angiotensin" and "baroreceptor inputs to the vasomotor system". Moreover, it is common practice to mix explanatory levels when describing biological functions, e.g., "a target organ of norepinephrine is the adipose tissue". Importantly, this jargon does not reflect or imply a lack of understanding on the biologists' part, but rather represent a compact, economical way of identifying complex biological systems (Machamer et al. 2000). When physiologists study a specific biological system, they attempt to identify biologically relevant or significant input and output of the system, that is, they try to identify input and output that has, or may have, at least some, however small, influence on self-maintenance. Physiologists also try to clarify the internal causal processes that lie behind the system's self-maintaining behavior, that is, they try to clarify the intermediary steps between input and output. These intermediary steps can be described as casual chains, that is, sequences of causally connected events involving parts of the system. Say that an event A has the effect B (or "A brings about #" or "A affects B"), if A belongs &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="4">206 Synthese (2008) 161:203-218 Fig. 2 Causal chains of various complexity. (A) straight linear chain. (B) interacting chains. (C) chains with reciprocal interactions to one of potentially several causal chains that lead from A to B. For instance, A in Fig. 2A would have the effects B, C, and so on. ('A9, 'B\ *C\ etc. in the text and in the figures represent particular events in, i.e., changes in the states of parts of biological systems). Whereas some causal chains studied by physiologists are simple linear chains (F?g. 2A), causal chains typically share one or several elements (Fig. 2B) and may display highly complex interactions (Fig. 2C). Examples of the latter abound in bio logical systems. For instance, interactions occur between various second-messenger systems at the cellular level; at higher organizational levels in humans, interactions oc cur between renal mechanisms and the respiratory apparatus that control the body's acid-base balance. All biological systems have at least some capacity for control, that is, a capacity to sustain a certain state (e.g., postural regulation, various forms of homeostasis) or change into another state (e.g., locomotion, growth, reproduction) in ways that are conducive to the maintenance of the system. Such control, as far as it is known, can only occur if the system itself is, or contains, a feedback system. A feedback system (or feedback control system) is a system which can instantiate a variable magnitude V for which there is a particular value Vo (known as the set point that may be time-varying) and an interval of values centered around Vo such that, whenever V is caused to take on a value that is sufficiently close to either of the endpoints of the interval, a causal chain of events involving parts of the system is brought about that eventually causes V to take on a value closer to the set point. (These conditions should be understood as being qualified with ceteris paribus clauses, such as "under a wide variety of conditions" and "unless further interference occurs".) Organisms are typically endowed with multiple, extensive and complex feedback systems, many of which have a set point that, when considered from the standpoint of the maintenance of the organism, is close to optimal. For this reason, physiologists talk about events or circumstances that cause the variable magnitude of such a system to deviate from the set point as disturbances or challenges. Physiologists also consider it useful to talk about the chains of events that eventually cause the variable magni tude V to take on a value closer to the set point as correcting chains or corrections. The variable magnitude V is said to be a controlled magnitude, and when correcting chains are activated in a feedback system, the system is said to control or regulate the controlled magnitude. Physiologists often use the language of information theory in describing feedback systems. Events in correcting chains are described as signals, some of which are said ?} Springer A0-[i]-[?]-[D]-n] Bn-D-B-B-D i i i t</page><page sequence="5">Synthese (2008) 161:203-218 207 Fig. 3 Causal chain with a^i ^^ w feedback 'W^^'W^^'W ... \_? to inform the system that a disturbance has taken place, while others are said to affect the system's responses to the disturbance. Moreover, the physical parts of the system which are involved in the earliest stages of correcting chains are described as sensing mechanisms or sensors. It should be kept in mind, however, that these evalua tive or anthropomorphic sounding terms ? "set point", "disturbance", "correction", "control", "signal", etc. ? are used only as convenient short form that can be dispensed with in favor of purely physical descriptions. Feedback requires that the system receives information about its own state or its immediate surroundings in order to respond appropriately. The result of a response must be detected directly or indirectly by means of sensors which influence the behav ior of the system, which in turn affects the state of the system or its immediate sur roundings. Consequently, when feedback occurs, a causal chain forms a loop or circle (Fig. 3). Such a loop is made up of two kinds of signal (Fig. 3): signals that inform the system about the state of the system or its immediate surroundings (afferent signals), and signals that affect the state of the system or its immediate surroundings (efferent signals). It must be emphasized that when physiologists talk about causal loops and circular causal chains, they never mean to say that two particular events A and B in such a chain cause each other. Rather, what is meant is that a particular event A of a generic type AT at a certain time t\ causes a particular event B of a different generic type Y at a later time ?2&gt; which in turn causes a particular event C of the first mentioned generic type A" at a still later time ?3. When dealing with linear chains of events (however complex, see Fig. 2), there is no conceptual problem in identifying what is causing what. But when a system includes feedback (Fig. 3), a perplexing phenomenon occurs. Since there is no given starting point for a circular chain of events, an element of a loop can, when considered as a generic type of event, be designated a cause (or effect!) of any other element of the loop. It may be logically possible (and factually correct) to say both that a generic type of event A" is a cause of a generic type of event Y, and that this generic type of event y is a cause of X. Yet physiologists claim that, while some such relationships may be described in terms of biological functions, others may not. I will illustrate this phenomenon with three examples of increasing complexity and show that it provides an important clue to understand the concept of function used in physiology. 3 Examples of biological function 3.1 Example #1: glucose homeostasis The concentration of glucose in the blood is controlled to be within a certain range (so-called glucose homeostasis). There are good reasons for this. Some organs ?} Springer</page><page sequence="6">208 Synthese (2008) 161:203-218 (e.g., the human brain) are critically dependent on glucose as an energy source, that is, the glucose levels must not be below a certain level or some organs will be irreversibly damaged. Conversely, although glucose is fairly inert, it does react with proteins (so called glucosylation), and this may severely alter their properties, that is, the glucose levels should not be too high. Many organizational levels are normally engaged to control the glucose levels including behavior (e.g., food searching) and biochemical levels (e.g., insulin, glucagon, cortisone, etc.). For my current purpose, I will focus specifically on the crucial role played by the ? -cells of the pancreas. It is well known that the extracellular [glucose] ("glucose concentration") affects insulin secretion of individual ?-cells and that a sensing mech anism resides in each ?-cell: when the extracellular [glucose] increases, insulin secre tion is increased and when the [glucose] is decreased, insulin secretion is decreased. Insulin in turn stimulates glucose uptake in various tissues including skeletal muscles and adipose tissues and thereby lowers the [glucose] in the body fluids. In an organism, these relationships can easily be seen to constitute a closed control loop comprising (Fig. 4) an afferent signal, that is, the [glucose] in the extracellular fluids, the ?-cells sensing [glucose] and producing insulin, an efferent signal (insulin), and peripheral tissues that may lower blood [glucose] by uptake of glucose. To characterize the system in Fig. 4, a physiologist would investigate these rela tionships by breaking the loop. For instance, the experimenter could break the loop by artificially controlling [glucose] outside the ? -cells so that the insulin secreted by the ?-cells could not affect [glucose]. Another way to break the loop is to artificially supply insulin to an organism independently of [glucose]. In such experimental situ ations there is no problem with the use of the words "cause" and "effect": anyone with basic training and equipped with the proper experimental tools would be able to determine the efficacy of glucose in affecting the insulin secretion from the ?-cells, and conversely, it would be easy to determine the effect of insulin on the glucose levels in an intact organism. A puzzling situation arises when the loop is closed (Fig. 4), that is, when the system is considered at a sufficiently high organizational level that incorporates feedback loops. (In the case of glucose homeostasis, an appropriate level would seem to be the whole Fig. 4 Glucose homeostasis. Simplified system description Glucose concentration Insulin secretion in ?-cells Uptake of glucose in tissues 4y Springer</page><page sequence="7">Synthese (2008) 161:203-218 209 organism.) The insulin secretion is controlled by [glucose], and conversely, [glucose] is controlled by the insulin levels, that is, glucose levels affect insulin secretion in an orderly and predictable manner and insulin secretion similarly affects glucose levels. Nevertheless, every physiologist would consider it sensible to claim that a function of insulin is to control (i.e., influence) glucose levels whereas none would accept the claim that a function of glucose is to control insulin secretion. Hence, whereas both statements seem to simply rephrase the factual state of a biological system, only one of them is considered to express a biological function. 3.2 Example #2: potassium homeostasis Let us consider a slightly more complicated example. Insulin has more than one bio logically significant effect. It is, for instance, the most important hormone involved in short-term regulation of the potassium concentration (i.e., [K+]) in the blood. Indeed, infusion of insulin is the standard emergency treatment for patients with dangerously high levels of potassium in their extracellular body fluids. Not surprisingly, diabetics have significantly higher potassium levels in the blood after a meal than non-diabetics. Yet this effect of insulin on K+ is not considered to be a function of insulin (Greger and Windhorst 1996; Berne et al. 2004; Guyton and Hall 2005). Hence, that an effect is biologically significant is not sufficient for physiologists to consider it a function. Figure 5 introduces two additional factors that have clearly demonstrated physio logical effects on [K+] and yet are not considered to be involved in the control of [K+] (i.e., in potassium homeostasis). The release of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) from the posterior pituitary gives rise to a temporary but not sustained increase in aldosterone secretion from the adrenal gland (Rayfield et al. 1973; Foster et al. 1997). By contrast, angiotensin has a sustained stimulatory effect on both the production and release of aldosterone, which stimulates the kidneys to excrete potassium (Rogerson and Fuller 2000). However, while ACTH, angiotensin, and insulin all influence [K+], neither of them is significantly affected by physiological levels of [K+], that is, they do not belong to a circular casual chain involving [K+]. Only the adrenal gland (or more precisely, certain cells of the adrenal cortex), [K+] and the concentration of aldosterone are part of a control loop (Himathongkam et al. 1975; Young 1988). Here, however, physiologists find themselves in the same kind of dilemma as with insulin and glucose: although they would deem it appropriate to ACTH Adrenal gland Aldosterone X Angiotensin Extracellular K+ concentration Blood volume and extracellular Na+ concentration Insulin Fig. 5 Potassium homeostasis. Some of the components that affect extracellular potassium concen tration [K+] ? Springer</page><page sequence="8">210 Synthese (2008) 161:203-218 ? Glucose concentration Sympathetic nervous system Insulin secretion in ?-cells Uptake of glucose in tissues Fig. 6 Glucose homeostasis. Simplified system description with respect to regulation of hypoglycemia (and hyperglycemia) claim that a biological function of aldosterone is to control [K+], they would not deem it appropriate to claim that a biological function of [K-1"] is to control aldosterone secretion. 3.3 Example #3: hypoglycaemia, insulin and the sympathetic nervous system Consider again glucose homeostasis. Insulin is not the only factor that determines the glucose level. Numerous other factors are involved. In Fig. 6 such a factor has been added, viz., the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). When glucose levels decrease to dangerously low levels, a condition known as hypoglycaemia, SNS gets activated. The ?-cells have so-called adrenergic receptors for the main signal substance from the SNS. When these receptors get activated, the insulin secretion of ?-cells is suppressed (Strubbe and Steffens 1993). In terms of the casual chain, the SNS thus affects the ? -cells, but the ? -cells ? by decreasing the glucose levels ? can also affect the SNS. Notably, in this case both insulin and SNS are involved in circular chains affecting [glucose]. Yet, it is not a function of insulin from the ? -cells to control the activity of the SNS, whereas it is a function of the SNS to control the activity of the ? -cells. 4 Defining "biological function" Evidence that the above account reflects consensus can easily be found in any major textbook in physiology or general biology (e.g., Berne et al. 2004; Guyton and Hall 2005; Greger and Windhorst 1996). This does not mean that all functional attributions and every denial of a specific function above are uncontroversial but this has little or no bearing on the subject of this article. If, for instance, it could be demonstrated that insulin is involved in a feedback loop that significantly controls [K+] (see, e.g., Hiatt et al. 1972), then everyone would agree that insulin does indeed has a function with respect to potassium homeostasis and the textbooks would be rewritten accordingly. ?} Springer</page><page sequence="9">Synthese (2008) 161:203-218 211 Given the examples above, we can extract the following features of any element X in a biological system S that is attributed with a biological function to bring about or maintain Y: In S a function of X is to bring about or maintain Y if and only if [i] S contains a feedback control system C that solves, or contributes to solving, a biological problem P, that is, a circumstance or a physical or chemical factor that challenges the short- or long-term existence of S, [ii] X brings about, or has the ability to bring about, Y, [iii] the effect Y of X is part of a circular causal chain or "loop" that is involved in the correcting behavior of C, and Y thereby contributes to solving the biological problem P, and [iv] neither the presence or absence of X nor X's bringing about of Y constitutes the biological problem P. Biological functions are thus attributes of elements in biological systems that have an effect which, by contributing to the correcting behavior of a feedback control sys tem, assists in solving a biological problem. This explains why it makes sense to say that a function of insulin is to control glucose levels, whereas it does not make sense to say that a function of glucose is to control insulin secretion. The reason is that the problem which is solved by the feedback system of which both glucose and insulin are parts, is keeping the concentration of glucose in the blood within a certain range, not the concentration of insulin; insulin, through its effects on the uptake of glucose in various tissues, contributes to the solution of this problem, whereas glucose does not. Indeed, low levels of insulin does not cause a "compensatory" rise in glucose levels, nor does low or high insulin levels per se constitute a biological problem. A similar line of reasoning explains why it is appropriate to claim that a function of aldosterone is to control [K+], but not the other way around, and why it is appropriate to claim that a function of the SNS is to control the insulin secretion of ? -cells, but not the other way around (cf. Fig. 6). It can also be explained why ACTH, angiotensin and insulin do not have functions in potassium homeostasis. For although ACTH, angiotensin and insulin all have bio logically significant effects on [K+], these effects are not part of any circular causal chains that figure in a feedback system which controls [K+]; hence, these substances do not have functions in potassium homeostasis. Likewise, despite that in humans, cortisol together with corticosterone is responsible for almost half of the mineralo corticoid effect that is typical of aldosterone and causally involved in [K+] regulation, no one claims that one function of glucocorticoids such as cortisol is to regulate [K+] (Ganon 1996, p. 334). An important feature of biological functions that is reflected in the above analysis is that elements have functions only with respect to a specific feedback control system (hence the presence of the variable 'C in the conditions (i) and (iii) above), although the reference to a particular feedback control system is often left implicit in function ascriptions, especially in popular presentations. More precisely, in system S, to bring about y is a function of element X with respect to the feedback control system C just in case S, X, Y and C satisfy the conditions (i-iv) above. Thus, insulin has a function in glucose homeostasis, viz., to participate in the control of glucose levels, but no function (albeit a powerful effect) with respect to potassium homeostasis. In addition, insulin has other functions besides influencing controlling glucose, and one is the regulation of growth in humans. ? Springer</page><page sequence="10">212 Synthese (2008) 161:203-218 Bodily growth in humans is critically dependent on the growth hormone (GH). Like other pituitary hormones, GH is released in pulses. The predominant secretion of GH appears in human shortly after falling asleep at night. This release in itself is not conducive to growth: not only is the hormone quickly eliminated (t\/2 ~ 20 min), but it is released while the organism is starving. One main effect of the released GH is, however, to stimulate the production of so-called IGF (insulin-like factors) in the tissues, in particular in the liver. The IGFs appear in the body tissues 2-4 h after GH stimulation and remain for a relatively long time (t\?~ 15-24 h). Again, this is in itself not conducive to growth, because little substrates for growth are available at late night or early morning. The released IGFs will, however, attach to IGF recep tors on peripheral tissues. By themselves the IGFs have little effects on the cells, but they will give rise to intracellular signals that stimulates the cell to grow and divide if another receptors on the same cells are occupied by insulin (insulin has, as well as other factors, a so-called permissive action', Jacob et al. 1996) In this situation, insulin acts as a sensor mechanism for growth regulation, that is, as a mechanism for sensing the availability of substrates necessary for growth. Consequently, it is appropriate to claim that insulin functions as a sensor mechanism with respect to growth regulation. Importantly noted, these different roles of insulin?decreasing extracellular potas sium levels, functional role in the control of glucose levels, and functioning as a sensor mechanism for substrate availability in growth regulation?are not roles arbitrarily "imposed" by the scientist. Insulin has these effects (and other ones too) whether or not recognized as such by the scientist. The specific role or function ascribed by the scientist to insulin in particular context depends, however, on which feedback control system he or she is considering. 5 The analysis amended The analysis above is incomplete, however. Every biologist would agree that a func tion of the brain case or "skull" in humans and other mammals (and indeed in all vertebrates) is to protect the brain against mechanical damage and harmful tempera ture fluctuations. Still, it is highly doubtful whether any effect of the presence of the skull is directly involved in any circular causal chain in a feedback control system in mammals or other vertebrates. Hence, it would seem that on an analysis of the sort the offered above, the skull does not have any function, a result which would be quite unacceptable. However, this result can be avoided by means of a slight extension of the analysis. To see how the analysis should be amended, note that, although no effects of the presence of the skull are involved in circular causal chains in a feedback control sys tem, the presence of the skull has effects that are necessary conditions for several feedback control systems to be able to engage in any correcting behavior at all. In vertebrates, vital parts of numerous feedback control systems are located in the brain, and unless these parts were protected from mechanical damage and gross tempera ture fluctuations, these systems would soon be rendered inoperative. Clearly, unless the bony skull (or some other physically similar entity) had the effects of absorb ing mechanical energy from objects that impact the head, none of these regulatory systems could persist for long. For this reason I submit that the skull indeed has a function with respect to these feedback control systems; moreover, I submit that ele ments in biological systems can have functions, not only by having effects that are ? Springer</page><page sequence="11">Synthese (2008) 161:203-218 213 part of circular causal chains in feedback control systems, but also by having effects that are necessary conditions for a feedback control system to be able to carry out its correcting behavior. The analysis offered above should therefore be amended to read as follows: In system S, to bring about or maintain y is a function of element X if and only if (i) S contains a feedback control system C that solves, or contributes to solving, a biological problem P, that is, a circumstance or a physical or chemical factor that challenges the short- or long-term existence of S, (ii) X brings about, or has the ability to bring about, Y, (iii) the effect Y of X is part of a circular causal chain or "loop" that is involved in the correcting behavior of C, and Y thereby contributes to solving the biological problem P, OR the occurrence of the effect Y of X is a necessary condition for Cs ability to engage in correcting behavior, and Y thereby contributes to solving the biological problem P, and (iv) neither the presence or absence of X nor X's bringing about of Y constitutes the biological problem P. Two things should be noted about the amended analysis. First, it preserves the basic insight that motivated the original formulation, namely, that to have a biological function is to contribute to the solution of a biological problem by playing a certain causal role within a feedback control system. The difference is that the amended analysis allows functional elements in feedback control systems to contribute to the solution of a biological problem not only by having effects that are directly involved in the correcting behavior of the system, but also by having effects that are necessary conditions for the system to remain in a state in which it is able to engage in any correcting behavior at all. Second, the analysis retains its ability to generate the correct and only the correct function attributions to the elements discussed in the examples. As pointed out above, ACTH, angiotensin or insulin are not parts of any circular causal chains that figure in any feedback control system that controls [K+]. And although ACTH, angiotensin and insulin have biologically significant effects on [K+], these effects are not neces sary conditions for the feedback system which controls [K+] to operate or remain operative. Hence, these substances do not have functions with respect to potassium homeostasis on the amended analysis. Now, it is true that glucose, when it is present at a level above the set point level of the feedback control system which upholds glucose homeostasis, stimulates insulin production. It is also true that unless glucose had this effect, the system's ability to engage in correcting behavior would be seriously hampered. However, it makes no sense to say that by rising above the set point level, glucose contributes to solving a biological problem. For any glucose level that deviates significantly from the set point level is itself a biological problem, and more specifically, is the problem which is solved by the system of which the insulin producing ? -cells are part. Therefore, it makes no sense to say that a function of glucose is to control insulin secretion on the amended analysis, and similar reasoning explains why it is incorrect to say that to control aldosterone is a function of [K+] or that to control the activity of the SNS is a function of the insulin secreting ?-cells. That an effect Y is a necessary condition for a feedback control system C to be able to engage in correcting behavior it to say that if Y did not occur and the containing system S were otherwise still intact, C would no longer be able to engage ? Springer</page><page sequence="12">214 Synthese (2008) 161:203-218 in the correcting behavior. If it is impossible for Y not to occur without the system S's disintegrating (e.g., because the organism would then immediately perish), the conditional is to be counted true by the convention that a subjunctive conditional with an impossible antecedent is true, and consequently, in such cases the occurrence of the effect Y is a necessary condition for the feedback control system C to be able to engage in correcting behavior. It is important to be clear about exactly which function attributions are sanctioned by the amended analysis on this conception of necessity. As pointed out above, that the bony skull absorbs mechanical energy from objects that impact the head is a func tion of the skull with respect to several feedback control systems. Vital parts of several such systems are located in the brain (e.g., the ones that control body temperature and osmolality), and unless the bony skull (or some physically similar item) absorbed mechanical energy from objects that impact the head, these systems would soon be rendered inoperative. Moreover, it is a function of the heart to circulate the blood with respect to every feedback system in the body, since it is impossible for blood circulation not to occur without the organism's immediately perishing, in which case every feedback control system in the body disintegrates. By contrast, the eyes have no function with respect to the system that regulates body temperature and the limbs have no function with respect to the digestive system. For even if the eyes were to loose their ability to pick up visual information from the organism's surroundings and the organism were otherwise still intact, the feedback control system that regulates body temperature would not thereby be rendered inop erative. And even if the limbs were to loose their ability to alter the location of the organism and the organism were in other respects still intact, the digestive system would not thereby be rendered inoperative. Hence, no spurious "pan-functionalism" is implied by the amended analyses, and nor are any function attributions sanctioned other than ones that would be approved of by the physiologist. A partially similar analysis of biological function has recently been put forward by Gerhard Schlosser (1988). According to Schlosser, "functional states, traits or items are those components of a complex system, which are under certain circum stances necessary for their self-re-production" (Schlosser 1988, p. 302). More formally (Schlosser 1988, p. 315): Fc is a function of Xc(t) iff for a certain period of time to&lt;t&lt;t + x + y&lt;to + T (i) X(t) is directly causally necessary to establish F(t + x) (under certain circum stances C\) (ii) F(t + x) is indirectly causally necessary to establish X(t + x + y) (under certain circumstances cj) (iii) the causal relations between X(t), F(t + x), X(t + x + y) are complex. Here X and F are types of state of a system which is capable of complex self re-production, meaning that it "can re-produce a certain state via different sequences of state transitions depending on the environmental conditions" (Schlosser 1988, p. 312). Further, t, t + x etc. are time indices, and F(t + x) should be read "At time t -f x, the system is in the state F". The analysis presented in this paper agrees with Schlosser's by entailing that a type of event or state has a function, only if it is an element of a causal pathway, or "chain", that is circular in the sense that the occurrence of a particular event (or state) of a certain type at a certain time causes, through a chain of causally connected events, an event (or state) of the same type at a later time. Schlosser, however, explicitly ?) Springer</page><page sequence="13">Synthese (2008) 161:203-218 215 denies that the notion biological function is connected to notion of feedback control (Schlosser 1988, p. 325). Moreover, Schlosser's analysis fails to take into account that biological functions exist only where there is a biological problem, i.e., a challenge to the continued welfare or existence of a biological system, to be solved. The latter feature of Schlosser's analyses makes it overgenerate: on Schlosser's analysis there are circumstances in which indeed it is a function of glucose to bring about the production of insulin. To see this, suppose that at a time t the glucose level in the blood is high (i.e., above the set point level) in, say, an adult human. Using Schlosser's notation, this can be written Glhl%h(t). Further, suppose that at the later time t + x the insulin level is high, which can be written Inhl%h(t + x), and suppose that at the still later time t + x + y the glucose level is back to normal, i.e., G/normal(i + x -f v). Finally, suppose that at the still later time t -f x + y + z the glucose level is once again high, i.e., G/hlgh (t+x +y + z). Clearly, it could be that each of these states is causally necessary? in the circumstances?for the one following immediately after it, and hence also for the following ones. To see that G/norma,(i + x + y) can be causally necessary in the circumstances for G/h,gh(i + x -f y + z), one need only assume that the circumstances are such that unless the glucose level is normal at t + x + y, the person will ultimately perish (e.g., due hyperglycemia and consequent hyperosmolality and dehydration), in which case his or her glucose level will never again rise above normal. Now, the states G/high(/), Inh{zh(t + x), and G/high(i + x + y + z) can be fitted into Schlosser's schema, with G/001 *1 (t+x + y) being one of the intermediate causal links which must be assumed to exist but is not explicitly mentioned. Moreover, it would seem that the glucose homeostasis system is one that "can re-produce a certain state via different sequences of state transitions depending on the environmental conditions" and that the causal relations between states G/high(i), 7nhigh(? + x), and G/high(/ + x + y + z) therefore qualify as being "complex". Indeed, Schlosser himself ascribes functions to states of the glucose homeostasis system (Schlosser 1988, p. 326, pp. 332-333), and on his own analysis such ascriptions are justified only if the causal relations between the relevant states are "complex". Consequently, Schlosser's analysis implies that there can be circumstances in which it is a function of a high level of glucose to bring about the production of insulin, a claim that most physiologists would find highly dubious. As pointed out in Sects. 4 and 5, on the analysis proposed in this paper, this consequence is blocked by the requirement that only states of a feedback control system that do not themselves constitute the biological problem solved by the system can be ascribed functions. In the case of the glucose homeostasis system, the problem to be solved is keeping the concentration of insulin in the blood within a certain range (the set point range or interval). This means that the problem to be solved by this system exists in two forms: (i) the system's being in a state in which the insulin level is above the upper boundary of the set point interval and (ii) the system's being in a state in which the insulin level is below the lower boundary of the set point interval, and accordingly, neither of these states can be ascribed a "function". A classical analysis of biological function that show some similarities to the one proposed in this article was provided by Ernest Nagel (1967, pp. 398-428). According to Nagel, an item in a system has a function just in case its presence is a necessary condition for the occurrence of a process in the system that contributes to upholding a state with respect to which the system is "directively organized" (or "goal-directed"). Directively organized systems are ones that "continue to manifest a certain state or property G (or ... exhibit a persistence of development 'in the direction' of attaining ?} Springer</page><page sequence="14">216 Synthese (2008) 161:203-218 G) in the face of a relatively extensive class of changes in their external environments or in some of their internal parts?changes which, if not compensated for by internal modification in the system, would result in the disappearance of G (or in an altered direction of development of the systems)" (p. 411). Nagel's analysis differs from both Schlosser's analysis and the one proposed in this article in that it makes no reference to circular causal chains. Moreover, Nagel did not require that upholding G solves or contributes to solving any biological problem with which the system is confronted. Due to the lack of requirements of this sort, Nagel's analysis is prone to generat ing spurious function ascriptions; this and other well-known problems facing Nagel's analysis has been reviewed by Melander (1997, pp. 19-38). 6 Philosophical conclusions There are at present two popular approaches to understanding the concept of bio logical function (Amundson and Lauder 1994): so-called causal role accounts (CR accounts) and selected effect accounts (SE accounts). According to CR accounts, an element's functions are its dispositions to contribute causally to the capacities of some containing system (e.g., Christensen 1996). Some CR accounts claim that any disposition that contributes to such a capacity is rightly called a function (relative to that capacity), but add that in many cases such an attribution may be of little or no scientific interest (Cummins 1975). Such CR accounts might be termed unrestricted CR accounts. Other CR accounts claim that at least in biology only dispositions that contribute to certain relevant or significant capacities can be rightly called functions. Such CR accounts could be termed restricted CR accounts. The capacities considered to be biologically significant by restricted CR accounts are usually, on the level of the whole organism, survival and reproduction, and on the level of subsystems of the organism, capacities that directly or indirectly contribute to survival and reproduction (see e.g., Prior 1985). According to SE accounts, an element's functions are those of its effects that gave ancestral organisms having that type of element the edge over conspecific competi tors that lacked it and thereby caused the ancestors to be naturally selected. On a SE account, the functions of an element are those of its effects that, via natural selection, explain (in part) its presence, and to state the functions of an element is to state (in part) why the element is present (Neander 1991; Griffiths 1993). The analysis presently offered agrees with CR accounts in that attributions of bio logical functions are not attempts to state why an element is present in a biological system. And accordingly, it denies the SE account contention that attributions of biological functions by their very intended meaning constitute hypotheses about how elements in biological systems have evolved by natural selection. Moreover, the analysis presently offered is similar to a restricted CR account, but with an important difference. On both unrestricted and restricted CR accounts, ACTH, angiotensin and insulin, by having biologically significant effects on [K+], have a causal role with respect to the organism's ability to uphold potassium homeostasis, an ability that clearly contributes to the organism's ability to survive. Hence, on most CR accounts, these effects on [K+] would be considered functions with respect to the organism's ability to uphold potassium homeostasis. This awkward conclusion is blocked on the analysis presently offered by its requirement that a functional element must contribute to the solution of a biological problem either by having effects that ? Springer</page><page sequence="15">Synthese (2008) 161:203-218 217 are directly involved in the correcting behavior of a feedback control system or by having effects that are necessary conditions for such a system to remain in a state in which it is able to operate. For neither ACTH, angiotensin nor insulin satisfies any of these conditions with respect to the feedback control system which regulates [K+]. On the analysis presently offered, the physiological practice of attributing func tions to elements in biological systems does not rest on or presuppose any teleological assumptions (assumptions about design or preconceived goals, cf. Kitcher 1993). In physiology, the practice of attributing functions typically involves the use of evaluative or anthropomorphic sounding terms, such as "set point", "disturbance", "correction", "control", "signal", etc., but as pointed out above, these terms are used only as a convenient compact forms that can be dispensed with in favor of purely physical descriptions. The only substantial assumption underlying the physiological practice of attributing functions, except that the systems studied are highly complex physical systems, is that they are biological systems. That is to say, it is assumed that they are either part of or themselves systems that have the capability of active self-maintenance, a capability that, as far as it is known, can only be manifested if the system contains feedback control systems and hence have parts that have, and carry out, functions.
