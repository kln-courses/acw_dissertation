Box 39040, RamatAviv, 69978 Tel Aviv, Israel rosenzvi @post. tau.ac. il Abstract The scholarly consensus on the Rabbinic concept of the yetzer (inclination) takes for granted the existence of two yetzarim, good and evil, in every person. Some have noticed the marginality of the good yetzer in rabbinic discourse, as well as the fact that most sources discuss only one yetzer, but ascribed it to the inherent imbal ance of power between the two yetzarim. In this paper I wish to rethink this schol arly consensus, while taking the singlz-yetzer model, which appears in almost all rabbinic sources, seriously. A systematic analysis of all rabbinic references to the yetzer,yetzer, which attempts to distinguish as much as possible between sources, both chronologically (early or late), and geographically (Palestinian or Babylonian), yields a picture markedly different from the common view, and helps locate the (rather marginal) place of the two yetzarim in context of the rabbinic corpus in its entirety.

In the work of early twentieth " The term "yetzer" (from the Biblical root YTZR: to create, creature) has been translated in numerous ways: "inclination" "tendency," "disposition," "instinct," "desire," to name only a few (See e.g. the multiple translations appearing in a single book: Svend Holm Nielsen, Hodayot: Psalms from Qumran [Copenhagen: Copenhagen University, 1960], 27, 92, 132, 230).

Rosen-Zvi / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 513-539 century scholars, such as Frank Porter, Solomon Schechter and George Foot Moore, the yetzer was discussed first and foremost as a type of theod icy,2 grouped along with other explanations of the source of human sinful ness—such as Sirach's free choice, Paul's "Adamic fall," Qumranic cosmological determinism and Forth Ezra's "evil heart."3 In recent years the atmosphere has changed rather dramatically, and scholarly interest in the yetzer has shifted, by and large, from theology to anthropology4—the realm of human psychological dynamic and inner world.5 Sin was converted into desire, and the yetzer was associated more with Hellenistic and early Christian askesis, than with pre-rabbinic Jewish demonology. Rabbinic yetzer now became analogous to the lower parts of yetzer asyetzer asyetzer as a reified object, a thing, residing inside a person), we will keep it simply asyetzer, and discus the exact meanings as we go. 21 Even the titles of these studies indicate this.

While I do not intend to oppose this trend, which was proven fruitful in many scholarly areas, I do wish to problematize the manner in which it has recontextualized rabbinic discourse of the yetzer. 51 See Urbach's polemical statement: "they did not occupy themselves with philosophical dialectics, but with the variegated experienced of the man who believed in the good god and was tested by his ability to endure the trail of faith and trust" (Efraim E. Urbach, The Sages: Their Concepts and Beliefs [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1987], 483).</page><page sequence="3">I. Rosen-Zvi /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 513-539 515 man,6 rather than to external demons such as Mastema, Belial, and Satan. Accordingly, the war against it was compared to the Platonic struggle between mind and body (or bodily irrational appetites),7 as well as to Hel lenistic self-training and fashioning.8 A new scholarly consensus was thus formed in which the evil yetzer is mainly a sexual bodily appetite, and as such is in fact not truly evil, but dangerous, and so can be tamed and even enlisted.9 These transformations have also affected the scholarly attitude toward the concept of twojyetzarim. All scholars, old and new, assume that accord ing to the rabbis, humans have two yetzarim (inclinations) inside them: good and evil.10 Some have noticed the marginality of the good yetzer in 6י The gender biased language, here and elsewhere in the paper, is deliberate, mirroring rabbinic discourse itself. Although women certainly have yetzer according to the rabbis, as it is conceived as a basic human trait, rabbinic yetzer discourse is clearly masculine in char acter. This has to do, as Michael Satlow has shown, with the basic assumption that only men are able to control their yetzer, thus being the only ones subject to instructions regard ing it. See '"Try to Be a Man': The Rabbinic Construction of Masculinity," HTR 89 (1996): 19-40. On the interchangeability of "person" and "man" in rabbinic yetzer discourse see I.I. Rosen-Zvi, "Do Women Have a Yetzer?" in Spiritual Authority: Struggles for Cultural Power in Power in The Jewish Tradition (ed. Boaz Huss; Beersheba: Ben Gurion University, forthcom ing) [Hebrew]. 71 See especially Satlow, "Rabbinic Asceticism," which places yetzer discourse in the con text of "Philosophers throughout late antiquity [who] subscribed to this understanding of the soul, with its inner conflict between its rational and irrational (appetitive) parts" (212).

Some were even willing to hesitantly suggest that the good yetzer may be a later and even redundant addition to the doctrine of the single dcmomc yetzer}5 These ideas have been largely aban doned in recent scholarship, which has wholeheartedly embraced the dual yetzer yetzer system and the inner struggle it dictates. When the focus turned to men's self-fashioning and askesis, the two-yetzarim system supplies exactly the material which allows narrating it as a doctrine of inner struggle and self restraint. In this paper I wish to rethink this new scholarly consensus, while tak ing the single-yetzer model, which appears in almost all rabbinic sources, seriously. In doing so I shall try to avoid two methodological fallacies: bas ing conclusions on only a selection of sources, and discussing rabbinic literature as a unified corpus. A systematic analysis of all rabbinic refer ences to the yetzer, which attempts to distinguish as much as possible between sources, both chronologically (early or late), and geographically (Palestinian or Babylonian), yields a picture markedly different from the established" (Moore, Judaism, 484); "The stereotyped phrase 'the evil inclination' to express the antithesis of ,the good inclination was coined by the sages" (Urbach, The Sages, 472); "The doctrine of the yeser hatob and the yeser hara is the rabbinic method of meeting the problem" (Frank S.

The first section discusses the various Tannaitic expositions regarding theyetzer, especially concentrating on the single homily (m. Ber. 9:5) which explicitly mentions two yetzarim. The second further examines the history of the two yetzarim in the later, Amoraic, sources, both Palestinian and Babylonian. The last section will be devoted to exploring the implications of these findings to rabbinic anthropology at large. "Torah Spoke Regarding the Yetzer": Tannaitic Literature The idiom "Torah spoke regarding14 theyetzer" appears only three times in Tannaitic literature. The following occurrence is from Sifra, Kedoshim 3:9 (90b):15 "And only in the fifth year you may use its fruit, that its yield to you may be increased" (Lev 19:25)—R. Yose ha-Gelili says: It is as if you are adding the produce of the fifth year to the produce of the fourth. Just as the produce of the fifth year belongs to the owner, so too the produce of the fourth year belongs to the owner. R. Akiva says: Torah spoke regarding the yetzer, so that a person would not say: For four years I have troubled myself for nothing. Therefore, it is said: "that its yield to you may be increased." This Biblical passage (Lev 19:23-25) regulates the status of fruits during the first four years of their growth. It ends with an additional verse concern ing the fifth year which promises plentiful crops from then on. Simply read, this verse adds no new law and is seemingly redundant. In order to over come this alleged redundancy,16 R. Yose ha-Gelili deduces an additional H) On keneged as "regarding" (and not "against") see Wilhelm Bacher, Die ExegetischeExegetische Terminologie der JiidischenTerminologie der JiidischenTerminologie der Jiidischen Traditionsliteratur (Leipzig: J. C. Hinrichs, 1905), 124-25. 15) page numbers are according to the following editions: Mekhilta■. ed. Horowitz-Rabin (Breslau 1930), Sifra: ed. Weiss (Vienna 1862), Sifre Numbers: ed.

All translations are mine, according to the best textual evidence available. 161 On alleged redundancy as a prime motivation for Midrashic exegesis see Ishay Rosen Zvi, "When the Philosopher Meets the Rabbi," Theory and Criticism 15 (1999): 118 [Hebrew],</page><page sequence="6">518 I. Rosen-Zvi / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 513-539 law from the last verse, which pertains to the haiakhic standing of the fruits. R. Akiva, on the other hand, reads the verse literally, as a promise, the need for which he explains as addressing the yetzer. Since the Torah is aware of the difficulties of working the land for so many years without benefiting from the fruits, the passage adds a promise of reward in the fifth year. A very similar exposition was reconstructed in Mekhilta de-Rabbi Simeon Simeon bar Yohai on Exod 34:24:17 "I will drive out nations from your path... no one will covet your land"—the Torah spoke regarding the yetzer, so that Israel would not say, How can we leave our land, our homes, our fields, and our vineyard and make pilgrimage, lest others will come and dwell in our places. Consequently, the Holy One, blessed be He, warrants them: "no one will covet your land when you come up to be seen [to make pilgrimage to the Temple]." The Tannaitic authorship of this reconstructed exegesis is not certain, but we should note the striking similarity, both in content and form, to the previous exposition: both are homiletic expansions of verses of assurance which follow commandments, the very appearance of which must be justified. Each explains the promise as theTorah's response to fears identified with the. yetzer. Note that after the formulation "Torah spoke regarding the yetzer"yetzer" the fears are ascribed, in both cases, to the person, or collective, themselves: "so that a person would not say," "so that Israel would not say." The expounded verse is presented as a response to these apprehensions: "It therefore is said..." or "Consequently, the Holy One, blessed be He, war rants them." Another similarity is worth noting: both homilies appear in homiletic compositions (or part of compositions) identified with the school of R. Akiva.18 The first homily is attributed to him explicitly, as is the case with the third occurrence of the idiom as well.19 These are, as far as I can 171 This homily is reconstructed in both editions ofMekhilta deRabbi Shimon (ed. Hoffman, 164, ed. Epstein-Melamed 223) from the thirteenth-century Yemenite anthology Midrash Hagadol,Hagadol, as it was not preserved in any Geniza fragment. For the history and reconstruction of Mekhilta deRabbi Shimon, see Menahem Y. Kahana, "The Halakhic Midrashim," in The Literature Literature of the Sages Part II (Assen: Van Gorcum, 2006), 3-105, 72-77. 181 On these two schools, the history of their scholarly reconstruction, and the parameters of identifying specific Midrashic units with one or another, see Kahana, "The Halakhic Midrashim," 17-39. Sifre Deut. 222 (see parallels in Mek. RS 23:4, b. B. Mesiia 32b). I shall not discuss this rather cryptic homily here.</page><page sequence="7">I. Rosen-Zvi / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 39 (2008) 513-539 519 tell, the only references to the yetzer in homilies identified with R. Akiva. Scholars have long pointed to the fact that the older meaning of the term yetzer,yetzer, which is attested to in the Bible,20 and probably in Ben Sira as well,21 is natural: man's tendency, proclivity or choice. A similar meaning (or, bet ter yet, semantic field) appears in R. Akivas homilies. However, these homilies are exceptional in Tannaitic literature. Most of the occurrences of the yetzer are from the school of R. Ishmael, and they present a different picture altogether. Although this idiom does not appear in "R. Ishmael" homilies, they do contain similar formulations. Here are two of them: "Or in the waters under the earth" (Exod 20:4)—... [Scripture] went to such lengths in pursuit of the evil yetzer in order not to leave room for any pretext (amatla)22(amatla)22(amatla)22 of permitting it. (Mek. RI, Bahodesh 6, 243) "Nor shall you follow their laws" (Lev 18:3)—still, the evil yetzer can think to say, theirs are nicer than ours. Scripture therefore teaches (Deut 4:6): "Observe them faithfully, for that will be proof of your wisdom and discernment." (Sifra,(Sifra, Aharei Mot 13, 86a)23 Hermeneutically, these two homilies are very similar to "The Torah spoke regarding thζ yetzer" homilies. As in the above exegeses from the school of 20י The Biblical term, which is very different from its later developments, is discussed in TDOTTDOT 6:257-65· This natural meaning is not contradicted by the two verses, appearing before and after the flood, in which God finds out that human yetzer is actually bad (Gen 6:5; 8:21). If we can learn something from the divine disappointment, narrated in these verses, it is that the yetzer (whatever its exact meaning there) is not conceived as inker entlyently evil (otherwise no reason to be surprised). In fact we do not find an inherently evil yetzer yetzer yetzer before Qumranic literature (although the concept is indeed based on an exceptionally strong reading of these two verses; see n. 49 below). 211 I accept Cohen Stuart's conclusion (contra Porter, "Yecer," 136-46, and R. E. Murphy, "Yeser in the Qumran Literature," Bib 39 [1958]: 334-44 at 337-38) that we should not read the later, developed, rabbinic meaning of the yetzer into Ben Sira (Struggle, 88-93). Cohen Stuarts minimalist interpretation comes from his sound decision to base his judg ment first and foremost on the two verses in which the term yetzer was preserved in the Hebrew fragments (15:14, 27:6), before entering into speculative reconstructions from the Greek and the Syriac. 22) On "amatla," an explanation justifying an alleged problematic action or statement, see m.m. Git. 9:9, b. Ketub. 22a. 231 This homily is part of Mekhilta DeArayot, identified with the school of R. Ishmael (Yaakov N. Epstein, Prolegomena ad litteras Tannaiticas [Jerusalem: Magnes, 1957], 640 [Hebrew]).</page><page sequence="8">520 I. Rosen-Zvi / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 513-539 R. Akiva, these also explain seemingly superfluous wordings in the Torah as statements concerning the yetzer. The exposition in Mekhilta de-Rabbi IshmaelIshmael explains the great detail in the Torah's prohibition of the making of any image (Ex. 20:4): "of what is in the heavens above, or on the earth below, or in the waters under the earth," while the one in the Sifra resolves the need for the positive formulations that were added to the prohibitions of following foreign laws in Leviticus and Deuteronomy. However, despite their similar interpretive function these two homilies exhibit a completely different attitude to the yetzer from that revealed in "R. Akiva" homilies. The disparity is in fact twofold: both in the nature of the yetzer s claim, and in the Torah's response. In both schools the yetzer s objections are linked to the observance of the commandments, but while, for the school of R. Akiva, the yetzer fears the subsequent loss of its prop erty ("For four years I have troubled myself for nothing," "lest others will come and dwell in our places"), for the school of R. Ishmael, the yetzer seeks to negate the very existence of the commandments (by seeking per mission to engage in idolatry, or by preferring foreign laws to "ours"). The Torah's response to this claim changes accordingly: for the school of R. Akiva the response (that is, the verse expounded) is a promise, while the school of R. Ishmael doubles and strengthens the prohibition. In other words, in one the Torah gives the yetzer a positive answer, and in the other, a stark negative one. This also explains the different terminology: according to the school of R. Akiva, the Torah always speaks to an undefined "yetzer" while the school of of R. Ishmael specifies "the evil yetzer." A study of all the Midrashic sources reveals not only the consistency of this difference—the term "evil yetzer" never never appears in midrashim from the school of R. Akiva—but also its fundamental significance. The evil yetzer, as presented by the school of R. Ishmael, is not a natural disposition or a simple embodiment of human desires, but an antinomian entity residing within men and inciting them against the Torah. The school of R. Ishmael is thus doubly innovative. It developed the image of the yetzer into a demonic enemy, and, at the same time, made it into a (the?) central component of its anthropology. Both stand in contrast to what we find in the school of R. Akiva, where the yetzer yetzer appears as the natural human tendency (or weakness) and occupies a marginal place.24 These two differences are interconnected: along with 241 Appearing only as part of the idiom "Torah spoke regarding theyetzer."</page><page sequence="9">I. Rosen-Zvi / Journal for the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 513-539 521 the change of its image, the yetzer received a more central place, as the explanation of human tendency to sin. The developed image of the yetzer in R. Ishmael's Midrash is clearly exemplified in a homily, which retells the Biblical story of the nocturnal encounter between Boaz and Ruth on the threshing floor (Ruth 3:6-15). This event, the focal point of the entire book of Ruth, transforms the heroine from a childless refugee to the wife of Boaz, eventually the matri arch of the Israelite royal line. The Bible describes this meeting in a laconic and enigmatic fashion, concealing more than it reveals. The Midrash, here as elsewhere, uncovers what Scripture hides. The following expansion unfolds the entire erotic drama that played out that night in the threshing floor, a drama on which the Bible only hints. But, to the reader's great surprise, in the Tannaitic reconstruction, the drama is not between Boaz and Ruth at all, but between Boaz and himself; to be more precise, between Boaz and his evil yetzer. Along these same lines: "As the Lord lives! Lie down until morning"—because his Evil Yetzer sat and importuned him the entire night. It said to him: "You are unmarried and you want a woman, and she is unmarried and she wants a man (teaching that a wife is acquired by sexual intercourse). So go and have intercourse with her, and she will be your wife." He took an oath against his Evil Yetzer. "As the Lord lives!"—I shall not touch her; and to the woman he said: "Lie down until morning" (Sif. Num., 88, 88). This homily is based on the words which Boaz says to Ruth, at the end of their charged encounter on the threshing floor: "if he will act as a redeemer, good! let him redeem. But if he does not want to act as a redeemer for you, I will do so myself, as the Lord lives! Lie down until morning" (Ruth 3:13). Simply read, this verse relates to the anticipated struggle the following day at the city gate, concerning Ruth's marriage. Boaz reassures her that someone will indeed marry ("redeem") her, and she can therefore sleep soundly. However, according to the punctuation suggested by our homily, the vow formulation: "as the Lord lives" belongs to the end of Boaz's state ment, and not to its beginning, as the MT has it. The vow has nothing to do with the struggle over Ruths redemption expected at the city gate the next day, but to the situation of the lonely woman that night on the thresh ing floor. Moreover, in this exegetical reading, the vow is not directed to Ruth at all, but to Boaz himself. The yetzer importunes Boaz "the entire night" to sleep with Ruth; in order to successfully oppose it, Boaz must</page><page sequence="10">522 I. Rosen-Zvi /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 513-539 adopt an exceptionally potent weapon and fetter himself with a vow in the name of the Lord. Only this will enable him to assure the woman that nothing will happen between them that night: "as the Lord lives! Lie down until morning." Beyond its interpretive creativity and its dramatic eroticism, Several features of this homily are worthy of attention. First, the change from an external drama to an inner one. The appearance of the evil yetzer moves the venue from the interpersonal sphere to the inner arena of the protagonist's desires and proclivities. As a result, the sexual drama here is one of thoughts and reflections no less, and possibly more, than of actions. The dangers lurking for man are within him, and not outside.25 Second, we should note the arresting and highly sophisticated nature of the argument advanced by the evil yetzer as it seeks to persuade Boaz to sleep with Ruth. The yetzer does not simply entice Boaz to sexual sin, but makes a persuasive and cogent legal argument. It appears as a learned Torah scholar who sets forth a full halakhic claim, beginning with a description of the legal situation ("you are unmarried... and she is unmarried"), and ending with the evi dent conclusion: "Go and have intercourse with her, and she will be your wife." Indeed, Boaz is incapable of contending with such a convincing argument, and so must bind himself using a vow. The image of the evil yetzer yetzer yetzer depicted here is not one of blind and unbridled passion; quite to the contrary, it is the image of a sophisticated inciter that cleverly tries to lead man astray. The yetzer seeks to draw one to sin based on pseudo-halakhic arguments, or, as we saw above, on "pretext of permission."26 The evil yetzer appears here as an independent entity who, despite the fact that it dwells within men, is in no way identical with them. Additional sources show that this is not a single literary instance, but a developed anthropological model which presents the evil yetzer as an entity inde pendent and distinct from people, while residing within their body. This externalization is highly significant for characterizing the human image and character: it is not Boaz who lusts for Ruth; from the very outset the 251 On this dynamic see Ishay Rosen-Zvi. "Bilhah the Temptress: The 'Testament of Reuben' and the Birth of Sexuality'," JQR 96 (2006): 65-94. 261 Although the homily does not specify why Boaz refused xheyetzer's legal advice, it seems clear that it assumes the yetzer uses the legal claim as a "pretext of permission" for sexual licentiousness. Indeed, Rav, an early third century Babylonian rabbi, is said to have flogged whoever married through intercourse (b. Yebam. 52a; b. Qidd. 12b, and the Talmud's expla nation there "due to licentiousness").</page><page sequence="11">I. Rosen-Zvi / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 513-539 523 initiative to sleep with Ruth comes from the evil yetzer alone, while Boaz is cast on the other side of this struggle, battling with his yetzer and success fully taming it. The struggle on the threshing floor between Boaz and his evil yetzer appears in another exposition identified with the school of R. Ishmael (Sif. Deut,Deut, 33, 59-60);27 Here, however, it appears within a longer list of sins from which one can be saved by taking an oath in the name of the Lord: "On your heart" (Deut 11:18)—This was the source of R. Josiah saying: A person must adjure his inclination, for you find everywhere that the righteous adjure their inclination. Abraham says (Gen 14:22): "I lift up my hand to the Lord"; Boaz says (Ruth 3:13): "As the Lord lives! Lie down until morning"; David says (1 Sam 26:10): "As the Lord lives, the Lord Himself will strike him down"; and Elisha says (2 Kings 5:16): "As the Lord lives, whom I serve, I will not take anything" This exposition, attributed to a leading sage of the school of R. Ishmael, is a classical "index homily," an exegesis that collects a series of verses with a common motif.28 In our case, the shared motif is the formula for swearing by the Lords name. A closer look, however, reveals that a profound the matic resemblance lies behind the shared linguistic motif. All these verses, despite their variegated contexts, speak of borderline cases, in which the status of the forbidden act is undefined. This is, as we have seen, the case in the taking of the unmarried Ruth by Boaz; and in all the other midrashic examples as well: Abraham's taking of booty following the war of the four kings against the five, in Genesis; David's opportunity to kill Saul, who is pursuing him, in the Book of Samuel; and finally, Elisha's taking of wages for healing Naaman, in 2 Kings. Although each of these acts could easily be justified (as other exegeses do), the Biblical hero, as this midrash has it, refrains from doing so by taking an oath, tethering himself in order to fight the temptations of the yetzer. By identifying them with the yetzer, the homily transforms these apparently borderline activities into ones that are completely prohibited. The seeming permission to engage in such matters is now presented as a "pretext of permission." According to the midrashic 27י For the identification of this passages in Sifre Deut. 41-47 ("If, then, you obey" in Deut 11:13-21) as R. Ishmael's, see David Z. Hoffmann, "Zur einleitung in die halachis chen Midraschim," Jahresbericht des rabbiner-seminars zu Berlin (1886-87): 1-91, 66-67. 281 On this term see Daniel Boyarin, Intertextuality and the Reading of Midrash (Blooming ton: Indiana University Press, 1990), 26-30.</page><page sequence="12">524 I. Rosen-Zvi / Journal for the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 513-539 exegeses, the halakhic arguments that would seem to permit Boaz to have sex with Ruth, as well as the other permissive justifications, are themselves the advice of the evil yetzer. The yetzer is thus used by the exegete as a means for the resolving of religious doubts: what appears doubtful looks that way because of the advice of one's inner predilection, whereas it is totally forbidden in reality. There is yet another lesson this homily might teach us. In Boazs case the evil yetzer appears within an explicit sexual context. The list in Sifre Deu teronomyteronomy shows that the case is more complicated. The evil yetzer draws men to all manner of sins: in can draw Boaz to intercourse, David to mur der and Abraham to theft. Other sources indeed prove that the sexual context has no privileged standing in Tannaitic midrasbimP A A sophisticated battle must be waged against the yetzer. Good will is not enough; different strategies, such as taking an oath in Gods name, to extricate oneself from the. yetzer s wiles and exhortations must be employed. The most popular tool is Torah study: "The school of R. Ishmael taught: If this repulsive one assails you—lead him to the study hall" (b. Qidd. 30b; b.b. Sukkah 52b): The same idea appears in greater detail in Sif. Deut 45 (103-104):30 "Therefore impress these My words upon your heart" (Deut 11:18)—this tells us that the words of Torah are like an elixir of life. This is comparable to a king who was angry with his son, struck him a violent blow, and placed a bandage on the wound. He told him: My son, as long as this bandage remains on your wound, you may eat whatever you please and drink whatever you please, and bathe either in hot or cold water, and you will come to no harm. But if you remove it, it will immediately fester. Thus the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel: I created your evil yetzer, and there is nothing more evil than it, [but] "If you do right, there is uplift." (Gen 4:7)—Be occupied with words of Torah and it will not reign over you. But if you abandon words of Torah, then it will gain mastery over you, as it is said (ibid.): "sin crouches at the door, its urge is toward you"—it has no business other than with you. But if you wish, you can rule over it, as it is said (ibid.): "yet you can be its mas ter"; (Prov 25:21): "If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat... you will be heaping live coals." 291291 Sifre Num. 88 is in fact the only Tannaitic yetzer homily with a clear sexual context. 301 See n. 27 above.</page><page sequence="13">I. Rosen-Zvi / Journal for the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 513-539 525 This extremely complex homily starts with a quotation from Deut 11 and ends with one from Gen 4. It begins with a reading of ve-samtem (Deut 11:18) as an acronym for "sam-tam," an efficacious remedy. Since the remedy is "these My words," it is read as the words ofTorah, and since it is to be placed "on your heart," the homilist concludes it is meant against the yetzer (which of course dwells inside the heart). The Midrash then proceeds to a parable which develops this motif, before ending with a pic turesque description of the evil nature of the yetzer, as it expounds Gen 4:7 phrase by phrase.31 This is no doubt the most developed presentation of the ev\\ yetzer in the entire Tannaitic corpus. Despite its length and sophis tication, however, the picture emerging from this exegesis is fundamentally similar to what we have already seen in other sources from the school of R. Ishmael. This may be distilled to three main principles: 1. Men have a single yetzer given them by God, which is evil in nature and dwells in their hearts. 2. Men and their yetzer constantly struggle, since the yetzer seeks to dominate men, ensnaring them to sin (following Gen 4:7: "sin crouches at the door, its urge is toward you"). 3. The evil yetzer may be ultimately defeated ("yet you can be its mas ter") by engaging in Torah study. Thus, the homilies of the school of R. Ishmael present ζ yetzer which differs gready in character and development from R. Akivas "Torah spoke regard ing the yetzer." Both however posit only one yetzer, which appears as a natural human tendency in one school, and as a demonic entity in the other (thus the term "evil yetzer"). The entire Tannaitic corpus affords a single exception to this rule: a homily which reads the verse: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart" (Deut 6:5) as referring to: "both your yetzarim, the good yetzer and the evil yetzer."32 The homily reads the word bekhol ("with all") as an indicator of a multiplicity which exists inside the heart,33 and thus to the demand to recruit all parts of it to 3" The message implicit in the transition between the two parts of the exposition is that the same One who created mans evil yetzer also provided the remedy, the "elixir of life," which is Torah. 321 M. Ber 9:5 and parallels: t. Ber. 6:7; Sifre Deut. 32. 331 Most commentators assume that the homily is based on the double letter bet in the word levav. A similar homily however appear also regarding the other bekhol statement in the verse (compare t. Ber. 6:7: "in all your soul—in each and every soul HE created in</page><page sequence="14">526 I. Rosen-Zvi /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 513-539 the service of the divine. A similar situation is discussed in Sifra Shemini 1 (43d):34 "This is what the Lord has commanded that you do" (Lev 9:6)—remove that evil evil yetzer from your hearts, so that all of you will be as one in awe and of one mind to serve the Omnipresent. Just as He is singular in the world, so let your service be singular before Him. For it is said (Deut 10:16): "Cut away, there fore, the thickening about your hearts and stiffen your necks no more." On what account? "For the Lord your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords" (Deut 10:17). If you do this, then (Lev 9:6): "the presence of the Lord shall appear to you." This homily not only portrays the evil yetzer as the obstacle to the service of the divine (its removal being a prerequisite for "serving the Omnipres ent"), but gives a precise analysis of the nature of the obstacle. The yetzer creates a duality and division within the human heart, thus preventing the singularity that is necessary for serving God. One cannot serve the Lord with all his heart when the evil yetzer resides in it. The yetzer thus must be extirpated in order to attain the desired unity.35 This midrash emphasizes the principle of unity repeatedly: "Just as He is singular in the world, so let your service be singular before Him."36 Mishna Berakhot and Sifra Shemini cope with the same basic problem: the duality of the heart, represented by the evil yetzer. Their proposed resolutions, however, are different and even opposing. The Mishna attains the desired unity by mobilizing the evil yetzer yetzer yetzer for the service of God, while the Sifra demands a removal of the yetzer,yetzer, using the metaphor of circumcision. Internalizing Spirits: The Origin of the Two Yetzarim Mishna Mishna Ber. 9:5 is thus unique in the Tannaitic landscape in both its dual istic model, in which the evil yetzer is part of a dual system of two oppos you"). Homilies expounding the "double bet" regarding the yetzer appear only in later, Amoraic, homilies. Seejt Ber. 9:5 [14b], Gen. Rab. 48:11 (489). 34' This is part of R. Ishmael's Mekhilta DeMiluim (Epstein, Prolegomena, 641). 3&gt;) Compare: "that you vanquish it [the yetzer] from before us and subdue it, so that we may do thy will as our own will with a whole heart (belevav shalem)" (y.

While dialectics are a matter of degree and emphasis, the dualistic system of two yetzarim is completely innovative, and its origin should be traced. What might the trigger for the appearance of two yetzarim in this single homily be? Some scholars suggest a prerabbinic source for the dual -yetzer doctrine, but none has succeeded in pointing out even one pre-rabbinic source explicitly referring to two yetzarim (or simply mentioning a goodyetzer) ?ד Other scholars point to the midrashic technique of reading double lettered words ("levavcha" in Deut 5:5 or "vayyitzer" in Gen 2:7) as indicating a double reality.38 However, this type of homily appears only in later, Amo raic, sources,39 and it is hard to see a midrashic reading alone as a source for such an innovative (and unique) doctrine. Daniel Boyarin has offered an original solution to this riddle. He sug gested two conflicting models existed side by side in rabbinic literature, the dualistic and the dialectic. According to the former, there are two yetzarim in every person (good vs. evil), while the latter discuss only one yetzer, which is, in and of itself, neither good nor bad (but potentially dangerous). Sources using the term yetzer (contrary to evil yetzer) usually refer to this second, dialectic model. Boyarin further suggested that the dual-yetzer model was inherited from earlier dualistic sources (like those appearing in 371 The most common source cited by scholars is the opening of the Testament of Asber which mentions two diaboulia, see however Hollander and de Jonge's remark: "it should be stressed that the author speaking about two diaboulia does not intend to say that there are 'zwei Seelen in einer Brust.' Every person has one diaboulion which has two options and is, after the choice has been made, either good or bad... it seems best, therefore, not to trans late it as 'inclination but as disposition in the sense of 'the predominant or prevailing tendency of one's spirit'" (H. W. Hollander and M. de Jonge, The Testaments of The Twelve Patriarchs:Patriarchs: A Commentary [Leiden: Brill, 1985], 339). Other sources do not discuss yetzarimyetzarim but spirits (ruhot in 1QS III 18-19 cited by Daniel Boyarin, Carnal Israel, 70) or advisors (boule in LXX to Prov 2:12, cited by Johann Cook, "The Origin of the Tradition of the יצר הטוב and the יצר הרע," JSJ 38 [2007]: 80-91), or simply do not assume any multiplicity (like Sir 15:14, cited by both). Scholars have wrongly assumed that two yetzarim yetzarim are the common rabbinic doctrine, and so went to finds its origins in second temple sources. 381 Schechter, Aspects, 243; Moore, Judaism, 483; Thompson, Responsibility 51; Cohen Stuart, Struggle, 10; Porter "Yecer," 110. 391 On "levavcha" see n. 33 above. On "vayyitzer" see Gen. Rab. 14:4 (p. 128), b. Ber. 61a.</page><page sequence="16">528 I. Rosen-Zvi / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 513-539 the Community Rule or the Testament of Asher), while the dialectic one represents the rabbis' own ideology and adaptation.40 In light of the above, these observations require several reservations: first, we should distinguish between different strata of rabbinic literature. While midrashim of the school of R. Akiva do not mention the term "yetzer"yetzer hara" (the evil yetzer) at all, those derived from the school of R. Ishmael use yetzer and yetzer hara interchangeably, the former function ing as shorthand for the latter.41 Second, the dualistic model appears in but one Tannaitic homily, and there is no reason to see it as the origin of R. Ishmael's popular evil yetzer, which is not one component of a two yet zarimzarim system, but a result of identifying the old, single, yetzer (as it appears e.g. in Ben Sira as well as in the homilies of the school of R. Akiva) as evil in nature. Lastly, the unique "with both your yetzarim" homily combines both dualistic and dialectic models, thus warning us against treating them as two exclusive alternatives.42 Nonetheless, I agree with Boyarin that the two yetzarim are indeed related to pre-rabbinic cosmologies,43 but the relationship should be located somewhat differently. We do not need the (rare, exceptional) dual istic model in order to spot connections between Qumran and the rabbis. 401 "My hypothesis here is that those rabbinic texts which speak of the Evil Desire as being necessary and even good represent a dialectical anthropological tradition that stands in opposition to an alternative dualist one... There is a strong tendency in the dialectical tradition to dispense with the term "Evil Desire" entirely and refer to that entity simply as 'Desire'" (Boyarin, Carnal Israel, 67). "My hypothesis is that the Rabbis inherited the term 'Evil Instinct from the first century Judaism much more averse to sexuality than they were, and unable to dispense with it, they ironized the term—'the evil instinct is very good'... It is called the Evil Instinct solely because of its destructive side" (idem, 63 emphasis in the original). For analysis and developments of Boyarin's yetzer model see van der Horst, "Evil Inclination," 64; Shanks Alexander, "Art," 115-17. 4" Compare, for example, Sif. Num. 88 "he took an oath against his evil yetzer to the parallel homily in Sif. Deut 33 "for we find everywhere that the righteous adjure their yetzer"yetzer" On a similar phenomenon in Amoraic literature see n. 59 below. Already Schechter noted: "Yezer without any further specification is often meant the Evil Yezer" (Aspects, 262). My addition is that this phenomenon originated in the homilies from the school of R. Ishmael. 42) The more developed dialectic statements—those cited by Boyarin, Carnal Israel—appear only in later, Amoraic sources. See n. 68 below. 431 Pace van der Horst, who argues against Boyarin: "there is no proof whatever that the rabbis inherited a term they actually disagreed with, on the contrary, there is a clear evi dence that they themselves invented and coined it" (Jews and Christians, 64). The term "evil yetzer" could not possibly be invented by the rabbis for it already appears at Qumran.</page><page sequence="17">I. Rosen-Zvi / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 513-539 529 After all, Qumranic literature knows of "two spirits," but, just like most of rabbinic literature, of only one jyetzer.44 The Qumranic yetzer is not an inherent part of the grand cosmological structure, determining the fate of humans, but seems nonetheless to solve a serious and elementary flaw in it. If the sect member is ruled by the forces of light, why would he nonethe less feel deficient, and in constant need of divine help? What is the source of the sinfulness of the sons of light?45 The Rule of the Community (1QS III 22-23) solves this flaw by assuming that Belial, the prince of darkness, works his powers on the sect's members as well;46 according to the Thanks giving giving Scroll, however, it is men's own yetzer that drags them to sin.47 It seems that while the homilies of the school of R. Akiva maintain the natu ralistic meaning of the yetzer found in Ben-Sira, the school of R. Ishmael continues the Qumranic concept of an explicitly evil yetzer.48 Qumranic literature is indeed the only pre-rabbinic corpus where the set phrase "yetzer ra can be found.49 441 This might be a misleading statement for it assumes a reified object, for which the yetzer is a proper name, a phenomenon which probably did not exist in pre-Tannaic times. I intend to dedicate a separate study to this complicated question. On yetzer in Qumran in general see Murphy, "Yeser"; Cohen Stuart, Struggle, 94-100. 45) See e.g. 1QH* 4:17-25 in which the member of theyahad thanks God for being chosen and at the same time asks for deliverance from sin. Carol Newsom remarks: "The very pos sibilitysibility of a moral life depends upon God's action of choosing one. Even then... the incli nation of the person is to sin and he is only prevented from his natural tendency by God's initiative" (Newsom, Self, 265). 461 See Aharon Shemesh, Punishments and Sins; from Scripture to the Rabbis (Jerusalem: Magnes, 2003), 78 [Hebrew]. The prime solution in the Community Rule is of course the very existence of the yahad which monitors and reduce the sinfulness of its members (through hierarchy, discipline, rebuke etc.). This is however missing from the Thanksgiving Scroll,Scroll, which concentrates on the experience of the individual instead. Cf. Newsom, Self, 273-77. 471 See Yacob Licht, The Thanksgiving Scroll (Jerusalem: Mossad Bialik, 1996), 33-35 [Hebrew]. Note however that according to 1QH" 15:3 Belial and the yetzer are intercon nected: "for Belial is present when their destructive yetzer becomes apparent". 481 Compare 1QH* 7:16 with Sir 15:14. Azzan Yadin has also identified specific similarities between Qumran and R. Ishmael's school. See his "4QMMT, Rabbi Ishmael, and the Origins of Legal Midrash," DSD 10 (2003): 130-49, idem, Scripture as Logos: Rabbi Ishmael and and the Origins ofMidrash (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004), 155-68. 491 llQPs'XIX 15-16; 4Q417 1 ii 12; 4Q436 1 i 10; 4Q422 I 12; 4Q370 I 3 (uncertain). The term is taken of course from Gen 6:5 and 8:21 (compare the explicit paraphrase of the former in 4Q370 I 3). See also the proximate terms :yetzer nitav (1QH' 2 i 17), yetzer remia (1QH* 3 9),yetzer avla (lQHa 3 10),yetzer ashma (1QH* 15:32; 4Q270 1 i 1).</page><page sequence="18">530 I. Rosen-Zvi /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 513-539 However, it is no less important to note the difference in the eminence of the yetzer in each of these corpora. A rather marginal concept in Qum ran50 became the focal point of (at least one part of) Tannaitic anthropol ogy. This transformation should be seen in light of rabbinic refusal to accept the grand cosmological models subjecting man to superhuman external forces, thus leaving the yetzer alone to account for human sinfulness.51 I would thus suggest, revising Boyarin's thesis, that the single evil yetzer of the school of R. Ishmael is itself a reaction to pre-rabbinic conceptions of evil and specifically a result of the rejection two prevalent models for explaining the source of sin in pre-rabbinic literature. The first explanation rejected is the simple, Biblical model of free will, adopted and developed especially by Ben-Sira (e.g. 15:11-16).52 Other rejected explanations are dualistic and deterministic conceptions, prevalent at Qumran and related literature, where sin is attributed to external cosmological forces which rule man. Against the former the Tannaitic midrasb argues that sin is not a simple consequence of men's free will. Rather, it is caused by an independ ent entity, the evil yetzer in ones heart. Against the latter, however, it con tends that the yetzer is not an external cosmological force, and that man is capable of prevailing over it. This twofold repudiation led to the birth of a complex and distinctive model that could easily explain the human ten dency to sin, without compromising human agency. Sin is caused by the evil yetzer that dwells within people, who nonetheless have the ability to fight it and prevail.53 501 Marginal also in scholarship. Holm-Nielsen, Hodayot, dedicates one footnote to the yetzeryetzer (274 n. 2) while Newsom, Self, dedicates a single line to it (272). Ishay Rosen-Zvi, "The School of Rabbi Ishmael and the Source of yetzer hara," Tarbiz 76 (2006): 41-79. 52) On Sirach's "naive" account of the problem of evil see John J. Collins, Jewish Wisdom in the the Hellenistic Age (Louisville, Ky: Westminister John Knox Press, 1997), 80-96. On his quasi-Biblical use of the yetzer see n. 21 above. 53) Compare Thompsons analysis of Fourth Ezra's evil heart (a generation or two before R. Ishmael) "By pushing his "theodicy" all the way back to the evil yetzer tradition, he virtually admits the inadequacy of any of the other solutions to the theodicy problem" (Thompson, Responsibility,Responsibility, 340). Thompson specifically refers to Sirach's naive free will, Qumranic cos mological dualism and Pauline original sin.

Ishmael's evil yetzer, we can now return to MishnaMishna Berakhot 9:5. The exceptional dual -yetzer homily can be seen as the grafting of an external dualistic model onto the single yetzer doctrine (sub jecting it to human will).54 This reading is further supported by the context in which this exceptional homily appears, at the very end of Mishna Bera khot.^khot.^ The focus of the last chapter of Mishna Berakhot as a whole is the obligation to praise God for bad and good events alike.56 This issue makes the polemic with dualistic doctrines exactly in place there, and similar polemical statements appear elsewhere in rabbinic literature.57 Such a spec ulation, however plausible, should not dim the solitude of this homily, and the uniqueness of the two yetzarim doctrine in Tannaitic literature in general.

Stone, Fourth Ezra: A Commentary on the Book of Fourth Ezra (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1990), 63-64; Cohen Stuart, Struggle, 142-44; Thompson, Responsibility,Responsibility, 49-65. 541 This process has in fact begun already in Qumran literature itself. Scholars have noted that there is an inconsistency in the characterization of the two spirits in the Rule of the Community Community (1QS): "In 4:15-26 the two spirits divide humanity into two opposed spiritual groups of good and evil, but in 4:15-26 they divide the individual into two opposed spir itual dispositions" (Arthur E. Sekki, The Meaning ofRuach at Qumran [Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1989], 213-14). The second characterization admittedly comes quite close to rab binic idea of two yetzarim. Compare also 4Q186 which determines the ratio of light and darkness in each person through physiognomy (for example: "his spirit has six parts in the house of light and three in the house of darkness").

Schmidt, "Ancient Jewish Astrology: An Attempt to Interpret 4Qcryptic," in Biblical Perspectives: Early Use and and Interpretation of the Bible in Light of the Dea Sea Scrolls (ed. Michael E.

Schiffman, Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls: The History of Judaism, the the Background of Christianity, the Lost Library of Qumran (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1994), 363. 55, For other appearances of the yetzer in the Mishna (all three in tractate Avot, thus possibly later) see my "R. Ishmael." 561 Mishna 2 rules that "for bad tidings one should say "blessed is the true judge," mishna 3 that "a man should say the benediction for misfortune just as for good fortune," and, lastly, mishna 5 cites the Biblical source for these obligations.

Rosen-Zvi / Journal for the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 513-539 "A Poor Wise Man": Amoraic Yetzer In Palestinian Amoraic literature58 Rabbi Ishmael's yetzer has clearly won the day. Most sources develop the model of one evil yetzer,^ further refining it and adding all sorts of sinister characteristics to it. The result is an image of a demonic entity attempting to cunningly drag men to sin. A compari son of Sifre Deut. 45, discussed above, with a homily in Genesis Rabbah can exemplify both the differences and similarities between the Tannaitic j/έΐζίτ and the Amoraic one: "When man's ways please the Lord he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him" (Prov 16:7)... R. Joshua b. Levi said it refers to the evil yetzer. Usu ally if one is brought up along with another for two or three years he becomes closely attached to him, but this one grows with man from his youth until his old age and yet if he can he strikes him down even in his seventies or his eighties. This is [the meaning of] what David said: "You save the poor from one stronger than he, the poor and needy from his despoiler (gozlo)" (Ps 35:10). R. Aha said: is there a greater despoiler than it [th ζ yetzer]? This is [the meaning of] what Solomon said: "If you enemy is hungry, feed him bread" (Prov 25:21). {Gen. Rab. 54:1, 575) Both homilies present the burden of the yetzer which accompanies men through their entire life—as well as the possibility of being saved from its curse through Torah study. Both also end with the same verse (Prov 25:21) reading "your enemy" as referring to the yetzer itself. The Amoraic homily, however, presents a much more developed and refined yetzer than the Tan naitic one. While the Sifre likened the yetzer to a static object, a wound, 581 I shall consider the two Talmudim here, as well as the classic Palestinian Midrash com positions: Genesis Rabbah, Leviticus Rabbah and Pesikata Derav Kahana. On the (conven tional, but not uncontested) dating of these compositions to the fifth or six centuries see Myron B. Lerner, '"The works of aggadic Midrash and the Esther Midrashim," The Litem tureture of the Sages, 147-51. I have refrained from treating other, probably later, Midrashic compositions, such as Song of Songs Rabbah, Ecclesiastes Rabbah and Abot de R. Natan, which would have extended the discussion too much. I intend to dedicate an independent study to the yetzer in later rabbinic Aggadic Midrashim. 591 The terms "yetzer" and "yetzer hara" are freely interchangeable in Amoraic literature, just as they do are in R. Ishmael's Midrashim. Compare for example j׳. Yoma 6:5 "the evil yetzer desires only what is forbidden for it" to its parallel in y. Ned. 9:1: "the yetzer desires." I have found no consistency in using one term or the other (except the trivial fact that "yetzer" usually appears alone when declined: "yitzri," "yitzrach" etc.)</page><page sequence="21">I. Rosen-Zvi / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 513-539 533 Genesis Genesis Rabbah presents an active subject: a thief or trickster, "stronger" than man, patiently waiting for the right time to trap him (even seventy or eighty years!). Still, the fundamental similarity of the image of the. yetzer us an enemy of men, constantly dragging them to sin, cannot be denied. Most sources share this basic model and vary upon it. The yetzer appears as dragging men to severe sins like murder and idolatry,60 but also as responsible for unhealthy passions and moods which lead to improper actions: fear, anger, jealousy or pride,61 as well as recklessness and avoid ance of Torah study.62 It appears as a source of violent behavior, and even extends to fetuses and animals.63 The contexts, which vary in accordance with local interpretive and thematic needs, share a basic image of the yetzer as an evil entity, which leads men astray from their religious duties. Though its specific context varies—from hatred to levity and from envy to mur der—its basic function is one: an explanation for the difficulty to become and remain a servant of God. The two-yetzarim model remains in the margins in Amoraic as well as Tannaitic literature. Only three out of fifty five sources discussing the yetzer yetzer yetzer in Palestinian literature mention two yetzarim, two in Genesis Rab bah,bah, one in Leviticus Rabbah,64 and none (out of twenty occurrences of the yetzeri) in the Palestinian Talmud;65 a striking ratio on any scale. Both the homilies from Genesis Rabbah which mention two yetzarim discuss the creation story, and are hermeneutically based on redundant letters which 601 Murder: Gen. Rab. 20:7 (190), idolatry: t.

Jeremiah in the name of R. Meir said that his refers to one who enthrones the Good yetzer over the evil yetzer' (771). The homily appears in a series of interpretations to the term "poor" in Ps 41:2. fi5) We do find the term "good yetzer" in two places in the Palestinian Talmud (y. Ber. 4:2 [7d], Sanh. 1:6 [19c]) as part of a list of good things a person might acquire. However, it does not appear there as part of a two-yetzer-system, but as a characterization of the (one) yetzer yetzer as good, thus probably indicating a dialectic rather then dualistic model. This is especially clear in the first source: a plea to God "to give me good heart, good fate, good yetzer,yetzer, good soul" which necessarily means "transform my yetzer, fate, heart, soul—into good." On this prayer see Louis Ginzberg, Commentary on the Palestinian Talmud (New York: JTS, 1941), 230-32 [Hebrew].

Rosen-Zvi /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 513-539 are read as indicating a duality in the creation of humans itself. One of the two treats the evil yetzer as the source of human fear (or, more generally, consciousness), which animals allegedly lack, while the other presents a dialectical picture in which the evil yetzer is actually "very good."66 The lat ter became extremely popular in current scholarship (and may well be the one most cited source regarding theyetzer).67 However, a systematic review demonstrated that this homily is exceptional in both its dualistic and the dialectic aspects. I found only a few other Amoraic sources promoting such a dialectic attitude toward the evil yetzer,6* and only two additional homi lies mentioning two yetzarim. The specific context of each of these homi lies demands elaboration, but for the present context it is more crucial to note their exceptionality per se. Most Palestinian sources have only one yetzer,yetzer, evil in nature, against which men wage a constant battle. Thus for example in the prayer in y. Ber. 4:2 [7:4]. R. Tanhum b. Scholasticus prayed: and may it be they will, Lord my God, God of my fathers, that you break and vanquish (tasbbit) the yoke of the evil yetzer yetzer yetzer from our hearts. For you created us to do your will. And we are obli gated to do your will. You desire, and we desire, and what prevents us? The leaven that makes the dough rise. It is obvious to you that we do not have the strength to resist it. So let it be thy will Lord my God and God of my fathers, that you vanquish it from before us and subdue it, so that we may do thy will as our own will with a whole heart.69 661 Gen. Rab. 9:7: "Nahman said in R. Samuel's name: 'Behold, it was very good': refers to the good yetzer, and Behold (vehine), it was very good: to the evil yetzer. Can then the evil yetzeryetzer be good, I wonder (etmaha)''. But without the evil yetzer no man would build a house, take a wife or beget children" (71-72); 14:4: "And God Created (vayyitzer): Two yetzarim, the good yetzer and the evil yetzer. For if an animal had two yetzarim it would die of fear upon seeing a man holding a knife to kill it" (128). 671 All yetzer studies discussed in this paper mention this source. 681 These are the sources 1 have found: Gen. Rab. 9:7 (cited above n. 66); b. Sotah 47a: "Yetzer,"Yetzer, child and woman—let the left hand thrust away and the right hand draw near"; yyy Ber. 9:5 [14b]: "Abraham our father made the evil yetzer good. As it is written: And You found his heart faithful before You'." These are in fact different types of dialectic attitude. The first source claims that the evil yetzer is not actually evil, the second that it should not be dismissed but treated with caution, while the third claims that it can be converted into good (similar to m. Ber. 9:5). However, they all share the rejection of the treatment of the yetzer yetzer as totally evil (thus demanding a total battle) as most sources have it. 691 Compare the Babylonian version (b. Ber. 16b) in which the prayer is ascribed to R. Alexander, rather then R. Tanchum, and appear in the context of private prayers, rather than of prayers said while entering to the house of study. Two thematic differences are</page><page sequence="23">I. Rosen-Zvi / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 39 (2008) 513-539 535 The good yetzer is totally absent here, and in fact it is hard to imagine how can it possibly fit into the picture. The supplicant wishes to act in accor dance with the divine will (just like Boaz and the other Biblical figures in the Tannaitic homilies above), but the yetzer fails him again and again. If the basic image is that "You wish and we wish," what role remains for the good good yetzer? The picture changes only a little when moving to the Babylonian Tal mud.70 One sugia in Bavli Berakhot gathers various sources on the two yetzarim,yetzarim, and presents them, for the first time, as physical organs, placed "between the two heart-keys" (b. Ber. 6 la).71 The appearance of this passage at the very end of tractate Berakhot leaves no doubt as to its Mishnaic origin. Two yetzarim appear in only three other Babylonian sources, two of which testify to its marginality even while presenting it:72 R. Ammi bar Abba said: What is the meaning of the passage (Eccl 9:14): "a little city, with few men in it"? "A little city"—this refers to the body; "with few men in it"—this refers to the limbs; "and to it came a great king, who invested it"—this is the evil yetzer, "and built mighty siege works against it"—this refers to sins; "present in the city was a poor wise man" (v. 15)—this is the good yetzer, "who saved it with his wisdom"—this refers to repentance and good deeds; "but nobody thought of that poor man"—for when the evil yetzer yetzer [dominates], the good yetzer is not remembered. (Jo. Ned. 32b) The struggle, according to this homily, is between two opposing, but by no means symmetrical, powers: The evil yetzer is a great king, while the good one is a poor (but wise) man. The last sentence, indicating the ten dency to "forget" the good yetzer altogether, might very well serve as a worth mentioning: the Bavli adds "subjugation to the nations" as another reason for deviat ing from divine will, and omits the sentence "you know we have no power to resist it." Both changes are telling. The first hints to a political recontextualization of the yetzer in the Bavli, as is apparent in other passages as well (see esp. b. Sukkah 50b-52a, which reads the yetzer in a collective, national, context). The second indicates a more positive evaluation of human potency against tht yetzer. Indeed, the concept of gaining control over ones yetzer is much more developed in the Bavli than in Palestinian sources, as noted by Michael L. Satlow, Tasting Tasting Tasting the Dish: Rabbinic Rhetorics of Sexuality (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1995), 158. 701 Out of eighty sources which discuss the yetzer in the Bavli, only four mention two yetzarim:yetzarim: b. Ber. 5a; 61a; b. Shab. 63b; b. Ned. 32b. 711 711 On this sugia see Rosen-Zvi, "The Amoraicyetzer" (Tarbiz, Forthcoming). 721 The third one—b. Sabb. 63b—is too laconic to decide.</page><page sequence="24">536 I. Rosen-Zvi / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 513-539 summary of rabbinic yetzer discourse itself. This is even more explicit in a second homily discussing various stratagems to strike the yetzer. R. Levi b. Hama says in the name of Reish Lakish: A man should always incite the good yetzer against the evil yetzer. For it is written: "Tremble and sin not" (Ps 4:5). If it [the evil yetzer] leaves, well and good. If not, let him study the Torah. For it is written: "Commune with your own heart Upon your bed" (idem). If it leaves, well and good. If not, let him remind himself of the day of death. For it is written: "And be still, Selah" (idem), (b. Ber. 5a) The first sentence clearly presents two yetzarim fighting with each other. As the homily goes on, however, the good yetzer disappears, leaving the per son to struggle in other ways against his single evil yetzer. The good yetzer is merely mentioned as a technique, not a very powerful one, for a person to beat tht yetzer. This further strengthens the conclusion above: the dual istic structure was artificially imposed on the yetzer discourse without really changing its nature. The struggle remains that of a man against his (single, evil) yetzer J1 Let us summarize our findings: Tannaitic sources present a clear picture of one yetzer in peoples hearts. The homilies from Rabbi Akiva's school portray it in a Biblical-like manner, as a natural proclivity, while Rabbi Ishmael's school produced homilies presenting a developed doctrine of an evil evil yetzer, adamantly fighting man. Two yetzarim appear in only one hom ily, which seems to be a polemic with dualistic doctrines. Its appearance at the end of Mishna Berakhot made this available for the Amoraim,74 but it appears in a small minority of Amoraic literature, and its artificiality is indicated by those sources as well. Taking the one-yetzer model seriously demands a thorough revision of the accepted picture of rabbinic anthropology in large. People are not sim ply a battleground for inner struggle; rather, they are positive creatures in nature, constantly struggling against their evil yetzer. Strong, sophisticated and demonic as the yetzer may be, it is still external; a "mighty king" invest ing the body from outside. The image is thus moderately optimistic: the struggle may be endless, but it is not a lost cause.75 731 A similar dynamic appears in Gen. Rab. 14:4. The homily sets forth a model of two yetzarim,yetzarim, but later on "forgets" the good yetzer, which is irrelevant to human struggle. 741 The Babylonian passage on this mishna presents the most developed doctrine of two yetzarim.yetzarim. 751 On the difference between the two Talmuds regarding human ability to best tht yetzer. see n. 69 above.</page><page sequence="25">I. Rosen-Zvi / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 39 (2008) 513-539 537 These findings come closer to "older" scholarship, which emphasized the theological context of rabbinic yetzer. Hardly a "blind appetite,"76 rab binicbinic yetzer is, by and large, a highly sophisticated entity, struggling to drag man to sin, not to satisfy bodily needs.77 It is evil, not base. The tempta tions of psychological analogies to the yetzer, explicit and implicit, should be resisted.78 Rabbinic yetzer also has no privileged sexual meaning. This context, which becomes dominant only in the anonymous later layers of the Bavli, has been adopted by many scholars as characterizing "rabbinic discourse" in general.79 The old picture is more to the point; rabbinic yetzer is much closer to demonic entities such as Mastema, Belial\ and Satan80— accounting like it for human attraction to sin—than to Hellenistic (or Jewish-Hellenistic) askesis. In his recent book on rabbinic "mythmaking," Michael Fishbane explained his choice of treating certain rabbinic narratives of the divine realm as myths, rather then metaphors: "the metaphor is a phrase isolated from a larger whole; and the mythos rereading of it is one feature of a larger drama" thus "one way to assess whether a given figure was a myth or a metaphor was to consider whether related elements occurred in the same contexts."81 It is exactly the large amount of sources, joining to a same 761 Compare Plato, Rep. 4:439a 77) The latter image is developed by Maimonides (Guide 2:12). See Sara Klein-Braslavy, Maimonides'Maimonides' Interpretation of the Adam Stories in Genesis (Jerusalem: Rubin Mas, 1987), 209-26. 781 See especially Jonah Frankel's discussion of the struggle against the yetzer as a kind of "Homo Duplex," a term taken from William James' theory of the psychotic personality. Yona Frenkel, Aggadic narrative: harmony of form and content (Hebrew, Tel Aviv: Hakibuts ha-meuhad, 2001), 101, and idem, The WaysofAggada andMidrash (Hebrew, Tel Aviv: Yad la-talmud, 1991), 498. 751 This phenomenon has to be seen in a broader context of hyper-sexualization of reality taking place in the Bavli (see my 'sexualizing the yetzer JJS [forthcoming]). On the ten dency of scholars to identify the stammaitic layer of the Bavli with "rabbinic Judaism' in general see Daniel Boyarin, "The Yavne Cycle" and Adiel Schremer, "Stannaitic Historiog raphy," both in Creation &amp; Composition: The Contribution of the Bavli Redactors (Stam maim)maim) to the Aggada (ed. Jeffrey L. Rubenstein; Tubingen: Mohr, 2005). 801 This becomes explicit in Reish Lakish's statement: "The evil yetzer is Satan and is the Angel of Death" (b. B. Bat. 16a). 811 Michael Fishbane, Biblical Myth and Rabbinic Mythmaking (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), 224-25. Fishbane's criterion is helpful mainly regarding sources which are less explicit in their presentation of the yetzer, such as Boaz and Ruth {Sifre Num. 88). The multiplicity of sources presenting the yetzer as an independent, sinister, entity residing in ones heart, suggest such a strong reading in these sources as well.</page><page sequence="26">538 I. Rosen-Zvi / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 513-539 basic picture of the yetzer as an independent (yet internal) entity, which makes its reading as a mere metaphor for conflicting psychological tenden cies so unlikely.82 The yetzer appears as an entity created by God ("I created your evil yetzer")?1 residing in the heart, and yet independent of it ("This is the evil yetzer which is hidden in man's heart"),84 and thus can (and must) be struggled with and ultimately removed ("remove that evil yetzer from your hearts").85 The vast majority of the sources present one, single, yetzer,yetzer, an evil (not dialectic!)86 entity (just like Satan or Belial) residing in the heart, and dragging men to sin (not to the satisfaction of bodily needs); its ultimate context is thus the origin of sin (and the ways to resist it), not askesisaskesis and control over men's lower parts. As for the good yetzer, we must admit it still remains a rather cryptic entity in the few places where it appears. It is not found in pre-rabbinic literature, and so cannot be explained (away) as a heritage of antiquity. It also makes very little sense in light of the function of the yetzer as an expla nation for human sinfulness, for if man himself struggles against his yetzer, there is no real role left for the good yetzer. Its appearance at the end of MishnaMishna Berakhot, in the context of the requirement to praise God for bad events as well as good ones, seems to be best explained as a debate with dualistic doctrines; A dualistic structure artificially pinned on the yetzer, resulting in the idea of "Loving your Lord with both your yetzarim." The 821 Pace Yehuda Libes, "de Natura dei," in Michal Oron and M. Goldreich (eds.), Masuot: Studies Studies in Kabala and Jewish Philosophy in the Memory of Prof. Efraim Gotlib (Jerusalem: Mossad Bialik, 1994), 254, who reads the human yetzer, just as the divine middot, as "psy etiological traits," and their presentations as "independent entities" as mere metaphors. In his important paper, Libes does insist that rabbinic myth (God as having changing moods, love/envy relationship with his people, in need of mental support etc.) is real and not figurative (see his debate with Shalom Rosenberg in Madaei Hayahadut 38 [1998]: 181 85), but it is psychological (thus anthropomorphic) in nature. Only later mystical literature reified the psychological myth into hypostatic entities. Without taking sides with regard to the divine middot, this picture simply does not suit rabbinic yetzer discourse. 831 Sifre Deut. 45. Compare "There are four things of which the Holy one, blessed be He, repents that he had created them... and Evil Inclination" (b. Sukkah 52b,y. Ber. 4:2 [7,4]). 84) B. Sukkah 52a. Compare b. Ber. 61a in which theyetzer is placed "between the two heart keys." See also theTannaitic homilies, mostly in Sifrei Deut, which read the words"levavcha/ Levavchem"Levavchem" as referring to the evil yetzer (Sifra Shemini 1: " Orlat Levavchem"; Sifre Deut. 45: "AlLevavchem"■, idem 32: "bekholLevavcha" idem 33: "AlLevavecha"). 851 Sifra Shemini 1. 86' Sifre Deut. 45: "nothing is more evil than it."</page><page sequence="27">I.
