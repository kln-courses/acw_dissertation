<plain_text><page sequence="1">Salon, Academy, and Boudoir Generation and Desire in Maupertuis's Science of Life By Mary Terrall* I AM GOING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU the different systems that have divided Philos- ophers on the way generation works. I will say nothing to alarm your modesty [pu- deur]. There is no need for ridiculous prejudices to spread an air of indecency over a subject which has nothing indecent about it." So saying, the anonymous author of Disser- tation physique ca l'occasion du ne?gre blanc launched into a notoriously freewheeling account of the forces and material properties responsible for the reproduction of organisms. The book, published anonymously in 1744 and soon recognized as the work of the aca- demician Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis, was widely read, translated, lambasted, and paraphrased. Maupertuis continued to work on the fraught questions of organization and generation, publishing an expanded edition in 1745 under the title Venus physique and developing his "system" further in another book that appeared in 1751. These frankly speculative and eclectic texts have been analyzed repeatedly in the historical literature as innovative theoretical constructs that opened up the scientific dead end of preformation- ism.' This literature puts Maupertuis's biological works in a strictly intellectual context, without regard to their rather peculiar style, form, and publication history. Here I aim at retrieving a less disembodied context for Maupertuis's reflections on organization and heredity. In offering a reading of these works that takes their idiosyncrasies seriously, I explore the very productive interconnections among polite conversation, literary gossip, erotic fiction, natural history, experiment, and philosophy in the early Enlightenment.

Maupertuis formulated a dynamics of organization in terms of naturalized desire and aversion that functioned as directing dis- positions inherent in the smallest units of organic matter. From the microcosm of active organic molecules to the macrocosm of human society, he suggested that indwelling desire supplied the motive force for many natural processes. However speculative this might sound to modem ears, it was in fact a synthesis that pulled together various kinds of evidence from experiments and observations current in the scientific literature of the 1740s. The most visible and successful Enlightenment men of science cultivated identities that went beyond their corporate affiliations with formal institutions and played off the advan- tages of membership in these bodies with potentially risky personal or philosophical as- sociations. Men with secure positions in elite institutions moved in and out of other set- tings, like cafes, theaters, and boudoirs, where philosophical matters were also part of the cultural currency exchanged. Maupertuis was particularly adept at moving among a range of venues defined by different practices and ideas. By the 1740s, when he publicly entered into discussion of organized matter, he was an established member of the Paris Academy of Sciences, well known for his mathematical and geographical accomplishments. In fact, he was at the high point of a career punctuated at times by controversy, accolades, and vicious attacks.2 He had recently been elected to the Academie Francaise and was well known outside the small community of academicians in the fashionable circles of salon and court (see Frontispiece). And in such urbane society, he was admired not only for his technical expertise but also for his charming conversation and a talent for playing the guitar. His reputation extended well beyond Paris, as he traveled widely and had his works translated into English, German, and Italian. Ultimately, he was wooed away from France by Frederick II of Prussia to lead the revived Berlin Academy of Sciences.3 Maupertuis chose to couch his arguments about generation in a particular style and to represent himself in a role rather different from the one he played when he wrote mathe- matical papers. Decisions about presentation and representation are part and parcel of science itself, and hence attention to intended and actual audiences is critical to under- standing scientific practice. In the early modem period, scientific writers often addressed more than one audience, recognizing that these audiences might well serve different pur- poses. Both the theory and the rhetoric of Venus physique played on the appeal, in certain circles, of a kind of socially acceptable subversiveness associated with philosophical texts, erotica, unorthodox religious beliefs, and illicit sexual liaisons. Writers and readers alike were fascinated with the subversive and the clandestine.4 Here I see an analogy between accusations leveled by theologians and royal censors against various kinds of knowl- edge about nature (e.g., Voltaire's Ele'ments de la philosophie de Newton or Diderot and d'Alembert's Encyclopedie) and police suppression of pornographic books about other 2 Pierre Brunet, Maupertuis: itude biographique (Paris: Albert Blanchard, 1929); David Beeson, Maupertuis: An Intellectual Biography (Oxford: Voltaire Foundation, 1992); Mary Terrall, "Representing the Earth's Shape: The Polemics Surrounding Maupertuis's Expedition to Lapland," Isis, 1992, 83:218-237; and Rob Iliffe, " 'Apla- tisseur du monde et de Cassini': Maupertuis, Precision Measurement, and the Shape of the Earth in the 1730s," History of Science, 1993, 31:335-375. 3 Others who managed this kind of cultural flexibility included Crebillonfils, Diderot, Montesquieu, d'Argens, Duclos, Clairaut, and Buffon.

As is well known, clandestine books could be about religion, philosophy, or sex-or even all three together.5 In addition to this conflation of subject matter, much eighteenth-century pornography adopted the trope of the voyage of discovery or the experimental program. The naive heroines or heroes of these books gain more and more knowledge with the multiplication of their experiences, and they end up varying parameters endlessly. The plethora of sexual possibilities were secrets to be dis- covered and revealed to the reader in the text, much as purveyors of natural knowledge displayed the mysterious phenomena of static electricity to enthralled audiences.6 Thinly veiled secrets also provided grist for the mill of the periodical press, especially the chatty newsletters that speculated about the authorship of anonymous books and re- ported, often in vaguely libelous terms, on literary and philosophical disputes. Politics, too, was conducted behind a screen of secrecy and sometimes leaked to the gossip col- umnists. In a world where censorship was often enforced by lettres de cachet and extended stays in the Bastille, clandestine knowledge carried the added value of being potentially dangerous, and denials of danger became formulaic masks for this kind of subversiveness. Philosophes, hacks, and their readers were all occupied with unmasking hidden truths, from the hypocrisy of priests to the paternity of illegitimate children to the forces of nature, and they often boasted of the risks associated with exposing truth. Maupertuis drew his reader's attention to the fashionable riskiness of his own work when he noted that handing the manuscript to the printer was "more difficult, or at least more dangerous," than writing it.7 THEORIES OF GENERATION The main contenders among theories of generation around 1740 shared a commitment to preexisting germs that developed through a process of expanding or unfolding. These theories were by definition one-parent models: the germ existed in all its complexity either in the male sperm or in the female egg. This clearly implied an asymmetry between male and female contributions to the reproductive process, and the sex act served only to trigger the preordained developmental script. Whether semen contained beings seeking out the nurturing environment of a womb or eggs contained latent organisms waiting to be acti- vated by sperm, God had created all creatures in miniature, ready to grow. Thus preexis- tence theories excluded the dynamics of organization from the domain of natural history. The meticulous observations of naturalists like Rene-Antoine de Reaumur only confirmed I Robert Darnton's work makes this point; see esp.

"We will never discover the apparatus necessary to produce such astonishing machines [fleas].... Such a great work could only have been created by the intelligence par excellence."8 The insect world provided many examples of strange and wonderful phenomena bearing on questions of design and generation. The other context for such discussions in the Acad- emy of Sciences was a long-standing debate about so-called monsters, congenitally ab- normal animals of all species, including humans. The pages of the academy's Memoires for the 1720s and 1730s record numerous cases examined by the anatomists Louis Lemery and Jacques Winslow.9 These two agreed about the preexistence of germs, but they dis- agreed about how to explain malformed structures. Lemery argued for the accidental re- arrangement of parts in the germ through the action of external mechanical causes. Wins- low, in deference to the inscrutability of divine wisdom, asserted on the contrary that the monstrous organisms must have developed from monstrous germs, created by God for unknown purposes. Lemery saw Winslow's position as an insult to divine intelligence: imperfect products could never be ascribed to God. This debate flared up repeatedly in the 1730s, whenever a new case was brought in for inspection and dissection. Travelers, farmers, and entrepreneurs were well aware of the Parisian taste for natural anomalies. When the opportunity arose they brought such curiosities to the capital, where they might end up in the academy or on display in private homes. A traveling exhibit of an albino Negro boy made the rounds of several genteel homes in 1744, provoking spec- ulation about the origins of racial differences and the inheritance of abnormalities. In the context of this flurry of interest in the African boy, Maupertuis formulated his challenge to academic discourse about generation and heredity. The boy himself appeared only fleetingly in Maupertuis's short anonymous tract, Dis- sertation physique a' l'occasion du negre blanc; an expanded version, published the fol- lowing year as Venus physique, added several chapters on hereditary abnormalities and the inheritance of acquired characteristics, including an account of albinism as a "mon- strosity." The book alternates among several discursive styles and postures. The preface strikes a pose of didactic gallantry that would have been familiar to the readers of Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle's Conversations sur la pluralite des mondes. The author declared himself to be following the command of an unnamed lady, "to whom I could refuse nothing," who insisted not only on an explanation of the albino boy's origins but on the publication of the work as well.'0 Overall, the book's tone alternates between the euphe- mism of erotic fiction and the description and analogical argument of academic papers. The albino figured as a rhetorical centerpiece of the text. The exclusive but not wholly private space of the salon, presided over by women with intellectual reputations and as- pirations, lent itself to animated and witty conversation about such things. Such conver- sation often spilled over into the world of print, in reports published in literary gazettes, short tracts, or letters." Although the albino boy could perfectly well have been discussed in the Academy of Sciences, Maupertuis chose instead to write anonymously for the same "enlightened" public that had witnessed and discussed the boy as an edifying curiosity. 8 Rene-Antoine de Reaumur, Memoires pour servir t 1'histoire des insectes, 6 vols., Vol. 6 (Paris, 1742), p. 547.

By addressing a nonacademic audience, carefully gendered as feminine, the author put into play various strategies of argument, presentation, and self-representation that would not have worked in a paper delivered to the academy. The deformed fetuses graphically depicted in the pages of the academy memoirs were studied as curious cases, dissected and described as bizarre anomalies that left theoretical assumptions intact. Maupertuis shifted discussion of congenital abnormalities away from anatomy and toward an alternative way of thinking about the forces governing organic formation, a way of thinking that had no congenial institutional home. But this is not to say that he was addressing only a fashionable audience ready to be amused or scandalized; he used the sociable and flirtatious style of the witty conversationalist to articulate arguments and conclusions with serious implications for a science of life. The conventions of galanterie framed a theory of active matter that clearly spoke to problems addressed in natural history, as well as to the philosophical concerns of readers and writers of the Republic of Letters. THE TEXT: VANUS PHYSIQUE The first chapter addresses the lady of the salon candidly. As we have seen in the disclaimer quoted at the beginning of this essay, the author promised to stay within the bounds of decency in his treatment of matters unavoidably pertaining to sex. However, he fore- grounded sex as a vital human activity before introducing submicroscopic forces or ex- perimental evidence. "Seduction, perjury, jealousy, or superstition need not dishonor the most important act of humanity [i.e., sex] even if sometimes they precede or follow it." This tongue-in-cheek profession of virtue and modesty is clearly reminiscent of pornog- raphy and leads into a hymn of praise to the pleasures of seduction and the consummation of desire: The lover feels a new ardor for all that he undertakes: everything promises him happy success. She who charmed him ignites with the same fire that burns him; she gives herself up to its transports; and the happy lover rapidly traverses all the beauties which overpowered him. He has already arrived at the most delicious spot.... Oh, unfortunate one, whom a mortal knife has deprived of that state! If the blade had ended your life, it would have been less deadly. In vain you inhabit vast palaces; ... you possess all the riches of Asia; the lowliest of your slaves who can taste these pleasures is happier than you.'2 The eunuch, victim of the "mortal knife," loses an essential part of his natural humanity, becoming an unnatural curiosity who serves to remind the reader of the pleasures of sexuality. The combination of the exotic (slaves, eunuchs, "all the riches of Asia") and the erotic ("l'endroit le plus delicieux") recalls novels like Charles de Montesquieu's Per- sian Letters, Denis Diderot's Indiscreet Jewels, and other more explicit pornographic books."3 Clearly, Maupertuis would not have used this rather overwrought style in a pre- 12 Maupertuis, Wnus physique, pp. 79, 79-80: "II sent une nouvelle ardeur pour tout ce qu'il entreprend: tout lui promet d'heureux succes. Celle qui I'a charm6 s'enflamme du meme feu dont il bruile: elle se rend, elle se livre 'a ses transports; et 1'amant heureux parcourt avec rapidite toutes les beautes qui l'ont ebloui: il est deja parvenu a l'endroit le plus d6licieux. ... Ah malheureux! qu'un couteau mortel a pnve de la connoissance de cet etat: le ciseau qui eut tranche le fil de vos jours, vous eut et6 moins funeste. En vain vous habitez de vastes Palais; ... vous possedez toutes les richesses de l'Asie; le demier de vos esclaves qui peut gouter ces plaisirs, est plus heureux que vous." 13 E.g., the euphemism "l'endroit le plus delicieux" appears in the notorious Histoire de Dom Bougre, in Oeuvres anonymes du XVIIIe siccle (I) (cit. n. 6), p. 34.</page><page sequence="7">222 SALON, ACADEMY, AND BOUDOIR sentation to the academy. Starting with desire and the pleasure of consummated desire serves to reorient the subsequent discussion of "scientific" evidence for readers more con- versant with narratives of seduction than descriptions of dissections. But at the same time, it opens up a speculative reassessment of that evidence for more expert readers who might otherwise have taken it for granted. The question of the origin of organization involves not merely the mechanical replication of forms but the very mystery of desire itself. "It is this moment, marked by such delights, that brings into existence a new creature who will be able to understand the most sublime things; and what is more, who will be able to taste the same pleasures.'4 Without denying the "sublime" aspect of pleasure, then, the author suggests that it can also enter into a systematic investigation of the phenomena of heredity and generation. These phenomena themselves may appear mysterious, especially in the language of preexistence theories, but they can yield to human understanding under the right circumstances. Maupertuis appeals to that part of his readers' experience farthest from the mediated experience of the labo- ratory. In and of itself, this authorial tone is hardly original; prose that builds to a climax, as in the passage cited above, was characteristic of descriptions of sex, whether in fiction or in articles in the Encyclopedie. But here it introduces detailed technical arguments and evidence associated with a different form of knowledge. The reader's identification with an account of sexual pleasure implies the shared ex- perience of author and reader. We might ask what place this has in a scientific text. Works of natural history that would have been familiar to Maupertuis's audience, like Reaumur's six-volume study of insects, did not use this kind of tactic. Reaumur does recount the "pleasures [sensibles plaisirs]" induced by admiration of the details of the insect world, but they are "soft and tranquil" pleasures that accompany "moral lessons that elevate the spirit toward the Being of all beings." If there is a moral lesson in Maupertuis's text, it is rather that we are all made of the same matter and subject to the same agonies and de- lights-and without the delight the species would not propagate itself. He puts both the reader and the naturalist (physicien) into the world as participants in the process of gen- eration, even as potential subjects of scrutiny, rather than fencing them off as passive admirers of God's handiwork. The reader can easily imagine the narrator, the physicien, perpetrating the seduction described in the quoted passage. In fact, Venus physique was criticized on just these grounds as indecent and self-serving.'5 The tone of provocative intimacy established in the introduction colors the book's treat- ment of experiments and observations as well. Semen examined under a microscope be- comes "that liquid which is not ordinarily the object of attentive and tranquil eyes." Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, "a chaste and religious Physicist, made a great many experiments [on semen], none of which, he assures us, were made at the expense of his family." As for the question of whether the semen penetrates to the uterus, "The liquid spilled into the vagina, far from appearing destined to penetrate further, soon falls back out, as everyone knows." Halfway through the book, the reader comes to a long interlude on the mating habits of animals, written in euphemistic but prurient language that might almost be called porno- 14 Maupertuis, Wnus physique, p. 80: "C'est cette instant marque par tant de delices, qui donne 1'etre a une nouvelle creature, qui pourra comprendre les choses les plus sublimes: et, ce qui est bien au-dessus, qui pourra gouter les memes plaisirs." 15 Reaumur, Histoire des insectes (cit. n. 8), Vol. 4 (Paris, 1738), p. xxix.

Anthropomorphic descriptions of animal behavior attribute passions, intentions, and morality to bulls, fish, turtledoves, and gall insects in a parody of the flowery style of much natural history writing and the natural theology it spawned. "What variety we ob- serve in the ways in which different species of animals perpetuate themselves!" This kind of hackneyed exclamation ordinarily expressed wonder at the luxuriance of God's creation. But when awe takes on a tint of prurience, eroticism undermines the reverence of such compendia of variations and turns the reader into a voyeur. In "the most unrestrained debauch," the queen bee maintains a "harem of lovers and satisfies them all." "The im- petuous bull, proud of his strength, doesn't fool around with caresses. He throws himself immediately on the heifer, penetrates deep into her entrails, and spills out in a great flood the liquor that makes her fertile." The male dragonfly pursues the female: "he catches her; they embrace, they attach to each other; and barely encumbered by what they have become, the two lovers fly off together and let themselves be carried by the wind."16 This subversion of natural theology reflects back on natural history as well. Although the behavior and forms of animals vary widely, as documented in lavishly illustrated natural history books, the underlying process of reproduction does not. Maupertuis claims this common ground as an object of scientific attention that goes beneath surface description to reasoning about causes and general laws. And since the process is part of nature, like the anticipation of pleasure that initiates it, it can be investigated with the methods of experiment, observation, and calculation familiar to men of science. Although VWnus physique is not a systematic treatise, neither is it, strictly speaking, a popularized version of scientific material watered down for an amateur audience. It mar- shals evidence from microscopy, anatomy, animal breeding, and everyday experience to attack preexistence theories on the one hand and descriptive "marvels of nature" natural history on the other. After pointing to the everyday evidence provided by family resem- blances to indicate that both parents must contribute materially to their offspring, Mau- pertuis drew on observations made by William Harvey almost a century earlier to support the plausibility of epigenesis, whereby an embryo develops sequentially through the jux- taposition of previously unrelated parts. Instead of homogeneous and infinitely divisible Cartesian fluids, Maupertuis posited corpuscular seminal fluids made up of heterogeneous particles with forces acting between them and, so to speak, animating them. Inherently active corpuscles from male and female fluids combine to form germs that develop into independent organisms. These active properties allow for many possible outcomes, within certain parameters, and they locate the capability to produce order in matter itself. They also erase the male-female asymmetry of preexistence theories. Whatever the physiological differences between men's and women's experience of sexual relations and reproduction, at the molecular level each parent contributes particles that combine without regard for whether they came from male or female bodies. As a model for the activity of matter, Maupertuis turned to chemical affinities, forces "of a different order" than mechanical forces of impact. The nonlinear, relational forces of affinity work nicely as an analogue for organic forces, because they inhere in matter but are not absolute quantities; the strength of the affinity binding two substances together may change with the advent of a third substance. Strong affinities between those elements "appropriate for forming traits similar to those of the individual parent" account for re- 16 Maupertuis, Venus physique, pp. 86, 88, 84, 102, 104, 102.</page><page sequence="9">224 SALON, ACADEMY, AND BOUDOIR semblances between parents and offspring.17 This account also leaves room for offspring that do not resemble their parents, because there are always particles floating around that correspond to features not visible in the parents. THE FORCE OF DESIRE Maupertuis refined his notion of the forces responsible for organization in Systeme de la nature, published anonymously in 1751.18 The focus of this text shifted from arguments about preexistence and epigenesis to the justification of a fundamentally dynamic concep- tion of matter. Chemistry retained its analogical role as the counterpoint to mechanical reductionism, but in spite of their selectivity and flexibility, affinities could not fully ex- plain organic form and function. "We must have recourse to some principle of intelligence, to something similar to what we call desire, aversion, memory." Desire and aversion operate as forces analogous to the affinities that propel, unite, and separate chemical sub- stances; memory links each organic element to its corresponding part in the parent organ- ism. Every element "retains a kind of memory (souvenir) of its previous situation and will resume it whenever it can, in order to form the same part in the fetus."19 But memory is not infallible, so Maupertuis builds the capacity for forgetting into the explanation. The very choice of memory as an operating principle implies the possibility of mistakes, or variations, and explains anomalous phenomena. Maupertuis's dynamic organicism made activity fundamental to matter. Everything in nature, he suggests, is more or less fluid; inert substances are just less so than organic matter: ... all the matter we now see on the surface of our Earth was once fluid, whether dissolved in water or melted by fire.... The least active particles of matter have formed metals and stones [marbres]; the most active formed animals and man. The only difference between these pro- ductions is that the elements of some continue to exist in a fluid state, whereas the elements of others harden so that they can no longer give rise to new productions. This picture challenges reductionism and denies the viability of a mechanical world of hard, impenetrable particles; nature's essential fluidity opens up possibilities for outcomes of any process contingent on a host of factors. In fact, all of nature as we know it could be returned to its primordial state by a cataclysmic flood or fire, setting off a new sequence of developments. "After such a flood or fire, new unions of elements, new animals, new plants or rather entirely new things could reproduce themselves."20 Investigation of a fluid, active nature demands methods other than those of anatomy or 17 Ibid., p. 139.

Maupertuis redirected the gaze of the physicien from internal structures and functions (the mechanics of conception or spontaneous generation) to visible traits and whole organisms in families and populations. His challenge to preexistence theories went beyond anatomy and physiology to a theory of organization (on the submicroscopic scale) and a theory of heredity (on the macroscopic scale). By introducing hereditary patterns, such a science would have to combine speculative reasoning about objects beyond the reach of observation with evidence collected from large groups of individuals. A key example was the inheritance of polydactyly over several generations of a Berlin family, in which the abnormality was transmitted through both maternal and paternal lines. Not only did this evidence imply the insufficiency of preformation as an explanation of hered- ity, because it was not tied to one sex or the other, but it led as well to calculations of probabilities for the occurrence of the trait in a given population. Similarly, evidence from animal breeding (again, close to the salon context, since women collected and bred cats, dogs, and birds) led to consideration of the mixing of traits and numerical predictions of outcomes.21 Far from being simply amusing illustrations, these examples suggested ways that the problem of life might be made a tractable subject for scientific examination. Much of the evidence Maupertuis collected could have been found in the pages of the academy's Memoires, but he combined that evidence with observations of patterns of hereditary traits as the basis for speculative claims about active matter. As the experience of the albino boy showed, unusual phenomena could be examined in aristocratic homes as well as in the meeting room of the Academy of Sciences. When he wrote anonymously in a style more suited to the salon than the academy, Maupertuis was acknowledging the vitality of a cultural space where women participated in and even arbitrated intellectual exchange. Highlighting pleasure-as a driving force, as natural, as innate to both sexes and all species-brought the examination of organic phenomena into an arena character- ized by the pleasures of mixed company and relatively unrestricted topics of conversation. His pitch to this audience did not mean that he wanted academicians to ignore his argu- ments; many of these men also frequented salons and read philosophical or clandestine books. Couched in terms accessible to nonspecialists, including women, Maupertuis's argument resulted in a novel approach to the scientific study of life. That is, he was not just trying to make it amusing. His stylistic choices do, however, indicate his recognition of the value of approval from a nonacademic audience. Behind a rather formulaic ano- nymity, he invoked the authority of his expert knowledge to make the albino prodigy more than a curiosity and active matter scientifically respectable. At the same time, he sought validation from an audience exempt from the strictures that governed the academy. He chose to address Ve'nus physique to a woman, in an intimate tone, and to underline its genesis in the display and conversations of the salon. This authorial voice carried beyond the limits of a few elite salons, however, and out into the diffuse cosmopolitan world of the Republic of Letters. Ve'nus physique was reprinted numerous times, and its arguments resurfaced in such central Enlightenment texts as the EncyclopeJdie.22 21 Animal breeders "apply themselves to satisfying the taste of the curious; they are, so to speak, creators of new species," who promote fashions for new breeds of dogs, cats, and birds: Maupertuis, Venus physique, p. 134. Practices connected with keeping and breeding pets in prosperous households are not well documented. Maupertuis kept cats and dogs, and he shared this hobby with salon women. In 1742 Mme. du Deffand arranged for Maupertuis to trade a copy of his book La figure de la terre for an Angora kitten from Mme. du Boufflers; see Mme. du Deffand to P.-L.

It is worth remembering that these polite and witty conversations, along with the many surrounding social and cultural events attended by the same people, also fostered sexual liaisons, often outside marriage. One of the effects of Maupertuis's textual posture was to confirm for his polite audience that sexual pleasure need not be alien to enlightened civilized society. There is no reason, he argued, to be shocked at open discussion of sex, a perfectly natural human activity. Elevating the natural as the basis of morality became, of course, a hallmark of Enlightenment cultural politics. A version of this strategy turned up in the Encyclope'die, for example, in Diderot's article "Jouissance": If some perverse man were to be offended by my praise of the most august and general of passions, I would conjure Nature up before him and make her speak. She would tell him, "Why do you blush to hear pronounced the name of a pleasure which does not cause you to blush when you feel its pull in the dark of the night? Are you ignorant of its purpose, and what you owe to it? Be silent, malheureux, and remember that it was pleasure that pulled you out of the nothingness. One thread in the historiography of gender and science has read early modem science as the forceful pursuit and violation of nature figured as a passive female.23 Whatever the merits and limitations of this interpretation, by the mid-eighteenth century Diderot was articulating a radically different personification of nature. This enlightened female Nature stands up and talks back to male hypocrisy, in the name of both pleasure and knowledge. The gendering of pleasure as feminine was also a commonplace in the lexicon of the Enlightenment. The reader of the Encyclope'die would have come across this litany in the article on woman: "This art of pleasing, this desire to please everyone, this wish to please more than anyone else, . . . this continual lie called coquetterie, seems to be in women a primitive characteristic." Feminine virtues and feminine wiles alike stimulated pleasure in the opposite sex, whether physically or through the refinement of conversation. At the same time, a long tradition backed up assertions about the special lasciviousness of women and the threatening power of female desire. The philosopher attempting to understand woman-that contradictory creature who partakes of universal human nature but who is also essentially not-man-faced a dilemma. "The word [woman]," we read in the same article, "inspires only agreeable ideas, which a moment later become disturbed sensations, 23 Denis Diderot, "Jouissance," in Encyclope'die, ed.

Maupertuis, writing in the decade preceding the publication of the Encyclope'ie, put the slippage between contemplation and desire to good use by making desire part of nature and part of science, as well as part of daily life. He brought science into female territory as a challenge to the academy, but also in order to stake his own claim to a privileged position in the salon world, among women.25 In his account of generation, both male and female contribute active components to the incipient organism, just as both male and female take pleasure in the sexual act. Furthermore, nature is dynamic in its own right, rather than a soulless machine. Nature is still the object of scrutiny; the scrutinizer is still male. But the scientist presents his findings to a significantly female audience, drawing women into the act of scrutiny, however mediated that involvement may be. Not only that, the male narrator/observer/experimenter himself participates in the cultivation of pleasure, both through his text and in his own experience. Ludmilla Jordanova and Thomas Laqueur, among others, have argued convincingly that the "scientific" study of sex in the late eighteenth century resulted in objectifying women and controlling female desire.26 What we see in this earlier period is remarkably different. Rather than a science of sex, a disciplining of sex through knowledge, Maupertuis sketched out a science that incorporated desire as a model for how nature works. Sex itself, as a human practice, he took for granted. Adapted from the language of fiction and conversa- tion, pleasure and desire operated as positive explanatory categories for the unexpected and contingent outcomes of natural processes. Maupertuis took some features commonly associated by his contemporaries with femininity (equivocation, sensibility, softness) and revalued them by building from them a science of life that combined speculative reasoning with experiment. In so doing, he incorporated that science into fashionable culture. As we have seen, Maupertuis drew out the implications of current natural historical facts in a frankly speculative manner. Though he was himself a careful observer of zoological phenomena, he went beyond the meticulous recounting of observational and experimental results to write broadly synthetic and provocative books, incorporating eroticism into his scientific arguments.27 (He never presented his biological work to the Academy of Sci- ences, either in Paris or in Berlin.) Venus physique was designed to provoke pleasure in the act of reading at the same time that it activated nature by giving matter the capacity for desire and memory. The forces of desire and aversion are not reducible to mechanics; passion is opposed to reason, but that does not mean that passion is beyond the reach of science. In fact, if desire and aversion are built into matter at the most basic level, then a science of life and organization that fails to incorporate passion must be a failed science. 24 Joseph Desmahis, "Femme (morale)," in Encyclope'die, ed. Diderot and d'Alembert, Vol. 6 (1756), pp. 473, 472. See also Lieselotte Steinbriigge, The Moral Sex: Woman's Nature in the French Enlightenment, trans. Pamela E. Selwyn (New York: Oxford Univ.

Joan DeJean makes a similar argument for the cooptation of the novel as a female literary genre by male authors in this period in Tender Geographies: Women and the Origins of the Novel in France (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1991). 27 Other Enlightenment writers crossed the boundary into pornography more explicitly (though also anony- mously): Diderot, La Mettrie, Crebillon fils.

VWnus physique referred in a veiled way to this genre. Its very title evoked pornographic titles like VWnus la populaire; ou, Apologie des maisons de joye (1727) or Venus dans le cloUtre (reprinted in 1741 from a seventeenth- century edition). The juxtaposition of physics and Venus in Maupertuis's title signals the overlapping categories the text addresses: a physical (scientific) account of sex, a physical (material) account of love, and a physics of generation that brings in pleasure as the force behind the perpetuation of species. "The motivation [for reproduction] in all species is pleasure. In humans, pleasure makes everything disappear before it; in spite of a thousand obstacles opposed to the union of two hearts, a thousand torments that follow, [pleasure] leads lovers to the goal that nature intended."28 Explicit pornography, often written from the point of view of a woman, described men and women alike initiating and enjoying sexual activities of all kinds. "Nature exercises the same empire over women as men," as one female narrator noted.29 Margaret Jacob has shown how materialist philosophy cohabited with explicit sexual descriptions in these texts. The male-female symmetries of epigenesis surfaced repeatedly in pornography. Plea- sure drives both men and women, and both sexes have a natural capacity for reason. As the frontispiece of the widely read The'rese philosophe (1748) proclaimed, "Sensual plea- sure and philosophy make the sensitive [sensible] man happy. He embraces pleasure by virtue of his good taste [gout] and he loves philosophy by virtue of his reason." In the course of the novel, Therese herself goes on to articulate a physics of desire in which the fluid forces of passion and reason, fluctuating in and out of equilibrium, determine the actions of the body.30 Against the background of pornography and materialism, Venus physique occupies a middle ground of civilized eroticism, of pleasure without excess. Maupertuis knew that his discussion of active matter would be read as materialist and possibly even atheist. As such, we might read it alongside the other clandestine philosophical literature of the En- lightenment. The constellation of mutually reinforcing themes in this work included soft- core materialism (active matter), subversion of the authority of the church over moral matters, the accessibility of knowledge of nature through the evidence of the senses, and the symmetry of male and female experience of pleasure. Where the female narrators of male-authored pornography seduced the reader into the pleasures of the text, in Venus physique the narrator enticed his female reader into accepting his critique of established 28 Maupertuis, Venus physique, p. 103.

Even before he developed his own theory of active organic matter, Buffon worked to discredit preexistence theories by looking for female seminal fluids. He found in the ovaries of rabbits, dogs, and cows "a seminal liquid, animated and similar to the seminal liquid of the male" (p. 211). In his drawing of what he saw in the microscope, these female "animaux spermatiques" look remarkably like those in semen.</page><page sequence="14">MARY TERRALL 229 scientific practice and theory by incorporating pleasure into that critique-both substan- tively and stylistically. "If what I have to say revolts you [because of implications of materialism], I beg you to regard it as no more than an effort I have made to satisfy you."931 Given the framing of the text, we can hardly miss the sexual overtones here, nor the resonance with the goals and strategies of libertine novels. But where the materialism spouted by fictional characters was often couched in the reductionist terms of mechanism, Maupertuis' s dynamic version of materialism privileged active relational forces, modeled on chemical affinities or human desire, over mechanical attributes like shape and motion. In effect, Maupertuis took the "enlightened" premise that sexual desire is natural, rather than threatening or dangerous, and turned it into the foundation of a theory and a model of scientific practice. At the end of Systeme de la nature (1751), Maupertuis took a further step by grounding molecular desire, aversion, and memory in matter's capacity for perception and even an all-purpose "intelligence": "The intelligence that we experience in ourselves necessarily implies a source from which emanates ... the intelligence of man, of animals and of all beings, down to the last elements.... The elements themselves, endowed with intelligence, arrange themselves and unite to fulfill the aims of the Creator."32 This intelligence is a kind of elevated instinct, a knowing where to go and what to do next, innate in living matter. From chemical affinities to desires and aversions to indwelling intelligence: we are back to the slippage between desiring and knowing, built into the natural world at the most fundamental level. What implications might this have for the professional knowledge- maker, the writer of texts and seducer of readers? He has written himself-as organism, as knower, and as sexual being-into the story. And to see this way of framing the scientific problem of life as partly a seduction gambit is not in any way to belittle it. The juxtaposition of a variety of stylistic moves, forms of argument, and types of evidence reflected the overlapping social settings and cultural allegiances of men and women who moved from salon to academy to boudoir, as they read and discussed philosophy, scandal sheets, letters, novels, and scientific texts.

Diderot pretended to read it this way in his own materialist manifesto, L'interpretation de la nature (1st ed., 1753), in Denis Diderot, Oeuvres completes, Vol. 9, ed. Jean Varloot (Paris: Hermann, 1981). Maupertuis responded in "Reponses aux objections de M. Diderot," in Maupertuis, Oeuvres, Vol. 2 (cit. n. 18), pp. 185-216.
