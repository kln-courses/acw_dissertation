Giuntine Galen , 1556 I The second volume of Carl Gottlob Kühn's flawed but still indispensable edition of Galen contains only the first nine and a half books of his fifteen book anatomical masterpiece, Anatomical procedures {De anatomicis administrationibus)} The Greek text breaks off at book nine, chapter six, leaving approximately half of Galen's work in Greek.2 For the remainder, we are in debt to the labours of the renowned Nestorian physician and translator, Hunayn Ibn Ishaq (d. 873). Hunayn renders Galen's often highly technical language with great skill - a daunting task made all the more so by the fact that it is highly unlikely Hunayn could have availed himself of the use of dissection to settle a disputed point.3 But although an Arabic manuscript of the complete work was available in Western Europe from at least the early seventeen century, it was not until 1906 that Max Simon produced the first edition and German translation, and not until Duckworth's 1948 Linacre Lecture that the full extent of Galen's anatomical endeavours was revealed to the monoglot English physician.4 In 1962, an English translation followed, based on Simon.5 This made the whole work available in * I am most grateful to the thoughtful criticisms and suggestions that were made by Armelle Debru and Heinrich von Staden.

Simon, Sieben Bücher Anatomie des Galen , two vols. (Leipzig 1906). W. L. H. Duckworth, Some Notes on Galen's Anatomy, Linacre Lecture, 6 May, 1948 (Cambridge 1949). It is debatable whether many physicians up to then had made use of Simon's 1906 translation. The complicated story of the fortunes of the Arabic manuscripts and of the attempts to publish an edition in the nineteenth century is chronicled by D. Gourevitch, 'Un livre fantôme: le Galien arabe de Greenhill', in Les Voies de la Science grecque , ed. D. Jacquart (Geneva 1997) 419-72. 5 W. L. H. Duckworth, M. C. Lyons, and B. Towers, Galen. On Anatomical Procedures, The Later Books, Cambridge, 1962. Although this edition is largely an English translation of Simon's German, Duckworth had the benefit of an Arabist (Lyons), and an anatomist (Towers), both of whom revised Duckworth's original translation. In this respect, The unknown Galen 87</page><page sequence="2">88 THE UNKNOWN GALEN English, for in 1956 Charles Singer had provided a somewhat eclectic and erratic translation of the Greek text.6 An Italian translation of the entire fifteen books was published by Ivan Garofalo in 1991, with a facing text of the Greek.7 The same scholar completed his editio maior of both the surviving Greek and the corresponding Arabic in 2000.8 In its entirety, Book IX is a treasure house of Galen's anatomical science of the brain and nerves, and represents the culmination of Greek endeavour in this field. Not until Vesalius would anyone else approach its mastery.9 In Book IX, Galen provides a detailed exposition of the anatomy of the brain and his experiments upon it, and outlines his work on elucidating the function of the nerves from the spinal cord. This paper highlights two particular topics, key elements of which are to be found principally in Hunayn's version: Galen's selective employment of animals for teaching purposes and his use of vivisection to demonstrate the hegemonic status of the brain. II Understandably enough, Galen's anatomical works have been more often cited than read for what they are. They are a mine from which several pertinent details about Galen's career may be extracted.10 Such information is without doubt of great interest, for it provides details of Galen's own working background in Rome, even if we are dependent on his word for them. Yet this material is incidental in a treatise which is first and foremost a manual of dissection. Next to his therapeutic writings, it is the most practical text Galen ever wrote. In Book IX, chapter 11, Galen puts this into perspective by stating that it is intended as a successor to his magnum opus of teleological physiology, On the usefulness of parts (De usu partium)}1 The Greek text of Book IX takes reader and student through the membranous coverings of the brain, its superficial and deep blood vessels, (especially the torcular Herophili) and those deeper structures, such as the corpus callosum and fornix , which, according to Galen support the underlying ventricles. It ends with an account of the fourth ventricle and its floor, the famous calamus scriptorius of Herophilus. In the second half of Book IX, the account of ventricular anatomy is completed, and the stage is set for Galen to demonstrate the nature of his experiments on the ventricles in living animals in order to determine their function. Whilst Galen does not claim originality for his discovery of the ventricles, he brings a special rigour it is in some ways an improvement on Simon's work. Notwithstanding Garofalo's translation (below, note 7), a CMG edition of the entire fifteen books remains a desideratum. 6 C. Singer, Galen. On Anatomical Procedures (Oxford 1956). Singer's translation is not without its merits (although his introduction and notes are disappointing), but he took it upon himself to abbreviate the Greek text where, in his view, Galen had needlessly repeated himself. 7 I.

He is described as possessed of an 'ardent love of anatomical observation' (II 216 K.). ii Galen's advice is that one must read the anatomical works in conjunction with his physiological texts {De ord. lib. suorum , XIX 54-55 K.; see below, note 13).</page><page sequence="3">JULIUS ROCCA: THE BRAIN BEYOND KÜHN 89 to their anatomy, elaborating an anatomical and physiological portrait of the ventricles which goes well beyond that first established by Herophilus and Erasistratus.12 Although Galen's On vivisection (De anatomia v iv or um), is not extant, there is sufficient evidence from other works to determine which animals he employed, and for what purpose.13 Galen used a great variety of animals for dissection and vivisection, especially primates, goats and pigs.14 Many of Galen's dissections were carried out on primates; specifically, according to him, on five types of 'ape'.15 Apart from tuíôt|ko&lt;; (the Barbary ape), the list includes XvyĶ (an unknown tailed ape);16 oáxupoç (perhaps Macaca mulatta , the Rhesus monkey); KuvoKécpodoç (dog-headed baboon);17 and ícnPoç (sometimes used as a synonym for oáxupoç).18 The one most commonly used by Galen (and known to Aristotle) was the Barbaiy ape of North Africa (Simia sylvanus or Macacus inuus).19 Galen made use of the ape in a way not dissimilar to how anatomy is usually taught today - that is, by prosected specimens, which can also be examined over a few days (allowing for varying periods of decomposition depending on the season and the tissues involved). The five types of apes formed for Galen part of a group of six classes of animals which he held were 'not far 12 What is extant does not allow one to conclude that the direction of their work necessarily parallelled that of Galen in all respects. 13 Cf.

The Giuntine De anatomia vivorum may, according to Ivan Garofalo, comprise genuine elements (G. Strohmaier, personal communication). See also I.

Nickel, AGM Beiheft 32 (Stuttgart 1993) 165-72. 14 Galen seems to have leant towards the Stoic view that animals were non-rational beings. On this reading, Galen maintained that animals suffer less than humans (cf. II 631-32 K.). On the treatment of animals in antiquity see J. Passmore, 'The Treatment of Animals', J. Hist. Ideas 36 (1975) 195-218, (198, 206-07). See also A-H. Maehle and U. Tröhler, 'Animal Experimentation from Antiquity to the End of the Nineteenth Century: Attitudes and Arguments', in Vivisection in Historical Perspective, ed. N. A. Rupke (London 1987) 14-47, although their notion (16) that Galen also avoided apes for vivisection in order to escape a charge of human vivisection is weak. 15 1 employ Galen's generic term for primates, 7iidr|KO&lt;;, or 'ape', since he did not differentiate between what is today distinguished as ape and monkey. Cf. W. C. O. Hill, Primates. Comparative Anatomy and Taxonomy , 4 vols (Edinburgh 1953-74): vol. 1 (1953) 3-4; vol. 2 (1966) 2-10, 211-12; vol. 3 (1970) 7-9; vol. 4 (1974) 194-96. See also G.

McDermott, 'The Ape in Antiquity', Johns Hopkins University Studies in Archaeology 27 (1938) 77-78, 95-100; and the earlier discussion by Simon in his edition, vol. II, xx-xxii. McDermott does not mention the Rhesus monkey by name in connection with Galen. By contrast, Singer in his translation, above, note 6, 240, n. 22, holds that although Galen 'preferred the Barbary ape... it is probable that he relied chiefly on the Rhesus monkey.' Singer assembles some persuasive anatomical evidence in support of this claim, but no anatomical description of Galen's can be exclusively applied to Macaca mulatta (cf. Hill, 1966, 9-10). On the other hand, E. Savage-Smith, 'Galen's Account of the Cranial Nerves and the Autonomic Nervous System', Part 1, CM 6 (1971), 77-98, at 79, states that Galen 'did not use the Rhesus monkey but rather the then plentiful Barbary ape.' On the distribution and type of the Macaca species, see C. G. Hartman and W-L. Straus, The Anatomy of the Rhesus Monkey (London 1933). 16 Cf. Hill, Primates , above, note 15, 1974, 195. i?

Jennison, Animals , above, note 15, 20-21, 127-29; and Hill, Primates , above, note 15, (1966), 9, 213, and (1974) 194-96.</page><page sequence="4">90 THE UNKNOWN GALEN removed from the nature of man'.20 According to Galen in Book XI of Anatomical procedures , this classification was known to the older anatomists.21 The classes comprise (i) apes (a parody - pi|LiT1|Lia yeÀoîov - of humans)22 and ape-like animals; (ii) bears; (iii) pigs; (iv) saw-toothed animals; (v) horned two-hoofed ruminants;23 (vi) hornless, smooth-hoofed animals.24 Such a classificatory system clearly gave Galen enormous leeway, not only in what he could dissect but in enabling him to claim that the anatomical findings made from such animals could validly be applied to humans.25 For the detailed dissections of the brain Galen made extensive use of the ox ( Bos taurus ), an ungulate, a member of his fifth class. One reason for this choice is given by Galen at the beginning of the discussion of the brain in the Greek part of Book IX, when he specifically mentions that the brains he is dissecting are ox brains, which, in the large cities at least, were everywhere on sale.26 Availability of dissection material is, obviously, crucial for an anatomist.27 Such procurement implies a steady and reliable source of availability: when Galen mentions that a dissector should be prepared to dissect other animals if there is a shortage of apes, for example, he may be acknowledging that members of this particular class were unavailable more often than not.28 Apes, especially the Barbary ape, although known in the Roman Empire, may have been hard to come by.29 Galen's own instructions (II 423 K.) to drown and not strangle the ape in order to avoid injury to the neck might also imply that the ape is a specimen that one does not readily encounter on a daily basis and thus all due care should be taken to see that no part of it is unnecessarily damaged.30 In such a friable and quickly decomposing material as the brain, the ready procurement of dissection specimens is above all else crucial, and once more indicates why ox brains were Galen's preferred subject matter. 20 II 423 K. I. Garofalo suggests that the six-class classification, although alluded to earlier, was instituted by Galen, 'The six classes of animals in Galen', in J. A. López-Férez, ed., Galeno . Obra, Pensamiento, e Influencia (Madrid 1993), 73-87, at 86. 21 XI. 2; 72. 22 De usu part. IV 126 K. The ape is yeÀoîoç with respect to the hand {De usu part. III 80 K.) and the muscles of the leg (III 264 K.). 23 II 430 K. 24 II 430-31 K. 25 Garofalo, Six classes, above, note 20, 85-86, adduces three reasons for Galen's use of such a variety of animals, citing availability, the relative differences in size, and the importance such a wide range of dissections had for the purpose of teleological argumentation. Teleology may well explain a significant part of Galen's motivation, but the ready availability of some animals and their size are arguably the crucial factors. 26 II 708 K. 27 J. M. C. Toynbee, Animals in Roman Life and Art (London 1973) 166, noted that goats were 'relatively cheap and easily obtainable sacrificial victims.' Cf. apes (55-60); cattle (148-62). That certain animals such as these were kept in sufficient numbers for sacrificial purposes made possible their ready procurement for other uses. See also O. Keller, Die Antike Tienvelt , 2 vols, (Leipzig 1909), I, 336-37; 402-03 and fig. 140. 28 II 227 K. Cf. Garofalo, Six classes, above, note 20, 85. 29 Pliny, Hist. Nat. VI 35,184, gives evidence for a cynocephalus and a sphingion form of ape, as well as a reference to varieties of ape in general (cf. VIII 80,215-16). But there is nothing here to indicate domesticated monkeys were bred, as Jennison claims, Animals , above, note 15, 128. 30 II 845 K. The neck dissection of an ape is described in De nerv. diss.

Of all the animals Galen dissected on a regular basis, the brain of the ox was by far the largest. Of the apes used, their brains, on average, weighed half as much as that of the bovine.31 The question of comparative size is a critical factor in Galen's approach to dissections in general: some points of anatomy are better seen in larger animals than in smaller ones.32 Galen dissected many animals of varying size, ranging from elephants (albeit an incomplete dissection) to insects.33 Conversely, useful generalisations on certain anatomical points drawn from larger animals could be employed to verify what cannot readily be observed in smaller, related ones.34 The larger size of the ox brain relative to that of the other animals Galen regularly dissected, combined with its ease of availability, made it his uncontested choice. How then, did the ape serve Galen's investigation of the brain? Galen did not ignore the brain and adnexae of the ape. The way he utilised this resource is instructional. Galen employed the brain and skull of the ape to demonstrate a number of quite discrete structures and thereby to impart a specific set of practical instructions. In other words, Galen's use of the ape brain is deliberately restrictive.35 It is Galen's intention, in Anatomical procedures , Book IX, to delineate: ... the method of dissecting the parts of the brain while it remains in its place in the animal body. The dissection is best made in apes, and among the apes in such a one as has a face rounded to the greatest extent possible amongst apes. For the apes with rounded faces are most like human beings.36 31 The average weight of the brain of Homo sapiens sapiens is 1350g; that of the ox, 470.0 g. The following may be added: Lemur {Lemur mongoz ), 20. Og; Spider monkey {Ateles geojfroyi ), 61. 5g; Gibbon {Hylobates sp.' 93. Og; Mandrill {Mandrillus sphinx ), 178.0g; Chimpanzee {Pan troglodytes ), 364. Og; Domestic hog {Sus scrofa' 98.0g. See S. Igarashi and T. Kamiya, Atlas of the Vertebrate Brain (Tokyo 1972). Although not all the species of primates Galen dissected are cited in this atlas, the lemur and mandrill have approximately similar brain weights to that of the Barbary ape. Only the brain of the young adult male of the Lowland Gorilla (G. gorilla gorilla ), at 440.0g, is comparable to the ox brain. There is no evidence that this species of ape was ever brought to Rome (strictly, no primate is truly indigenous to the Mediterranean). 32 In studying the branch patterns of the abdominal aorta, Galen reflects that it is in larger animals that some parts of the body are better seen, Admin, anat. XIII. 8; 171. Cf. J. Scarborough, 'Galen's Dissection of the Elephant', Koroth 8(1985) 123-34(124). 33 Galen states that he dissected not just those animals belonging to the six classes, 'but also animals of the kind which crawl, those which move forwards by bringing the abdomen to their aid, water animals, and those which fly. And if I complete this work that I have started, as is my intention here, I want to dissect those animals also and to describe what there is to see in them.' Admin, anat. XI. 12; 108. This project, which would have cemented Galen's reputation as the foremost comparative anatomist of Antiquity, was not fulfilled. Cf. Garofalo, Six classes, above, note 20, 85 n.68. 34 Admin, anat. XV.2; 227-28. Cf. F.J. Cole, A History of Comparative Anatomy. From Aristotle to the Eighteenth Century (London 1944) 47; Scarborough, The elephant, above, 32, 124 n. 6. 35 In Galen's use of the elephant, for example, it is not the entire animal Galen dissects; rather he examines its heart for two particular points of information: its similarity to the heart of other animals, and to solve the question of the presence or otherwise of the so-called heart bone, II 616-22 K. Cf. Scarborough, The elephant , above, note 32, 125. 36 IX. 10; 10. This description fits TtiihļKOc;, the Barbary ape, and oáxupoç (probably the Rhesus monkey). Cf. De usu part. III 844 K., where the ape which most resembles man is round-faced. Later in Admin, anat. (IX. 1 1; 15) when Galen begins his account of brain vivisection, he advises against using an ape, in order to avoid the expression on its face during the procedure, recommending instead an animal such as a pig or goat, since they have the louder voices which the experiment demands. On the one hand, Galen could be hiding his anthropomorphic sensibilities in this demand for sustained vocalisation; on the other, he might also be reflecting the lack of regular availability of apes for vivisection.</page><page sequence="6">92 THE UNKNOWN GALEN An ape brain is thus to serve as a learning template for the student, enabling him to gain experience before embarking on the more detailed anatomical investigations of the (bovine) brain. This approach may also have the effect of partially lessening the tension between the use of the 'human-like' ape brain (the subject of superficial dissections only) and that of the ox (the focus of the more comprehensive anatomical research programme). But before proceeding in this manner with the brain of an ape, Galen, in Anatomical procedures Book IX, also enjoins the student to gain experience by performing dissections on the relevant areas of other animals: Should you have become practised previously in this mode of procedure on the carcase of a dead animal, then it will not prove difficult for you to carry it out well and correctly on a living animal, all around the greater part of the bones of the skull, without tearing away the dura mater along with the bone of the skull.37 The reference to using other animal specimens (here not named by Galen), underscores the anatomical value of the ape, and again implies that such specimens are not as readily available as one might suppose. That Galen stresses the need to find as close an approx- imation as possible to man is also obvious: Galen reminds his audience that the information obtained from such a source is directly applicable to that of man. This is crucial for under- standing human osteology, where Galen shows some familiarity with the human skull. In Anatomical procedures , in discussing skull foramina, he remarked that: All these foramina you will see with your own eyes in a cadaver in which all that overlies the bones is decayed and the bones alone remain, in their connections with one another, without separating from each other. These can be seen in such human cadavers as you happen to look at ... and also in the bodies of apes when we have buried them for four months and more in earth that is not dry.38 The phrase, 'in such cadavers as you happen to look ať, should not be taken as evidence that Galen had recourse to a human skull for daily study when composing his anatomical works (although it does not rule it out either). Nonetheless, an important part of Galen's own anatomi- cal study in Alexandria involved the human skeleton, the only place where complete speci- mens were available for study.39 The situation in Rome was different?0 Of more immediate in- terest in the above citation is the mention of the ape skull. It is presented as an important source of osteological information and the careful preparation of an ape body by interment for four months underscores the value of such material. 37 IX. 10; 13. 38 XIV. 1; 182. 39 II 220 K. Cf. V. Nutton, 'Galen and Egypt', in Kollesch and Nickel, Galen und das hellenistische Erbe , above, note 13, 11-31 (15). 40 At De comp. med. sec. gen. XIII 604 K. Galen states that dissection was carried out on the bodies of the Germans in the Macromannic wars. Yet this was limited due, says Galen, to the physicians lack of anatomical knowledge. At II 385-386 K., Galen recommends taking advantage of the body of an exposed brigand. At II 386 K., Galen cites a 'frequent' practice of dissecting the bodies of exposed children, which had enabled anatomists to conclude that man had the same structure as an ape. This is cited in the third person plural, perhaps to draw attention away from Galen's own use of this material.</page><page sequence="7">JULIUS ROCCA: THE BRAIN BEYOND KÜHN 93 In Anatomical procedures , Galen proceeds with an exposition of the cranial bones in the ape, stressing their names, position, and sutures. This is done in order to stress their importance in the procedure of trepanation (àváxprioiç). Galen highlights this in the following way. After the entire skull of the ape has been exposed, the dissector is given meticulous instructions in locating and defining the sutures and their anatomical relationship with the underlying meninges (IX. 10; 1 1). The relationship between the cranial bones and the outer meningeal layer (the dura mater) of the brain is linked by Galen to the arrangement of the cranial sutures. These serve as vital landmarks in trepanation in order to avoid contact with the dura. It was known by Galen's day that if the integrity of this membrane was compromised, the results were, more often than not, fatal. Trepanation was an established procedure for dealing with skull fracture, and of particular concern were the consequences of a depressed fracture , where there was danger of bone fragments pressing directly onto the outer meninx of the brain.41 It is clear to Galen that such operations should be rehearsed many times until proficiency is gained. Moreover, to perform this procedure on a living animal enables the student to appreciate the importance of blood loss and to minimise trauma if possible. For Galen, the best way to gain such expertise is by utilising the skull bones and the dural relationships of an animal whose skull most resembles man. Thus he chooses 'apes with rounded faces'. They provide the best means for the most accurate application of a practical but potentially fatal technique. The skull and exposed brain of living apes therefore serve a different set of epistemological requirements compared to that of the bovine brain. They provide exact knowledge of vital anatomical landmarks for trepanation, and, secondly, they give the aspiring practitioner valuable preparation for later understanding the more detailed anatomy of the brain, since the key to such knowledge rests on experience, on learning the relationships between the skull, the membranous coverings of the brain and its underlying surface. The skull of the ape is for Galen a teaching tool, and one can well imagine that his students possessed a number of ape skulls.42 Where there was neither a tradition of (nor, perhaps, the need for) anatomical illustration, the brain and especially the skull of an ape 4i The earliest Western use of trepanation for skull fractures is documented in the Hippocratic Corpus. In Places in Man trephining (using the more general word rcpieiv) is recommended for what appears a depressed fracture, and the aim is to prevent the accumulation of purulent fluid within the wound {Loc., 32. 1; = E. Craik, Hippocrates. Places in Man (Oxford 1998) 70: 187-88). Three cases are described in Epidemics V(V 216, 227, 227-8 L). In the third case, the presence of exposed suture lines in the wound is an indication for prompt trepanation. A fourth case is given in Epidemics VII {V 404 L.). On Wounds to the Head cautions against too enthusiastic use of the trephine, even in cases of what are depressed and comminuted fractures, since there is a significant risk of damage to the dura with the use of the instrument (III 248-50; 258-60 L.). However, a fracture that is not comminuted is an indication for trephining (III 240-42 L.). Galen limits the use of trephining to the relief of pressure and its consequences; that is, to trauma involving the skull, and in such cases as the draining of phlegmatous lesions on the head. See J. Rocca, 'Galen on the uses of trepanation,' in Trepanation - History, discovery, theory , ed. R. Arnott et al. (Lisse 2002), 253-71. 42 Properly dried and prepared ape skull bones are also indispensable as aids in studying the nerve and vascular foramina, and the sutures. If this preparation is less than perfect, then, as Galen notes, errors of interpretation may arise: Admin. anat. XIV. 1; 182-83. See also Garofalo, Procedimenti, above, note 7, III, 1038-39. On the use of an ape skull in tracing the intracranial course of the optic nerve, see Admin, anat. X. 1; 28. Cf. X.6; 54 (the mandible); XIV. 1; 182 (cranial nerve foramina and preparation of an ape skeleton); XIV.4; 196-197 (cranial nerve foramina and the importance of animal skulls in general as learning guides). In discussing the types of animals to be used in dissection of the orbit and its contents, Galen reiterates the importance of the ape skull as a learning template. Admin, anat. X. 1; 29.</page><page sequence="8">94 THE UNKNOWN GALEN served both documentary and pedagogic purposes.43 They comprise a set of source materials to which the student may repeatedly refer during the more detailed investigation of the brain and its nerves. Furthermore, such practical knowledge of the skull and its immediate relationships is crucial if experiments on the brain of a vivisected animal are to be performed. Ill Galen's experiments on the ventricles reflect the methodology that characterises his entire approach to the physiology of the brain and the nerves.44 Furley and Wilkie conclude that Galen's '... experiments on the nervous system, in particular, carry total conviction as accounts of what he had himself actually done and seen.'45 The experiments Galen performs on the ventricles of the brain are crucial for his conceptualisation of the brain as the organ of the rational soul. For him, the brain is the hegemonikon for voluntary motion and sense perception.46 The ventricular system is the locus of this controlling centre.47 Anatomical pro- cedures Book IX tells how experiments may be performed on these cavities in order to establish their physiological status.48 Above all, Galen's anatomical works are interactive manuals in which he maintains and demands an impressively high standard. The descriptions of his vivisectional experiments are designed to reflect and reinforce those criteria. For Galen, dissection enables an anatomist to move beyond mere beliefs about the structure and function of the living body. This forms the basis of Galen's attacks on certain of his peers, who, whilst being referred to as anatomists , nevertheless perform no careful or precise dissections. Indeed, if they regard dissection as unimportant, then it follows they will have no inkling of the possibilities of determining function in the living animal by vivisection. Why then should they bother, concludes Galen in a telling phrase, 'to cut or ligate' the living 43 There is no evidence that Galen resorted to pictorial representations of the brain in his demonstrations to students or colleagues. He does, it is true, make use of a diagram in his description of the insertion and origin of the deltoid muscle (II 273-74 K.) and the cervical part of the trapezius muscle (II 445-46 K.). These are geometric idealisations which are meant to aid, not substitute for dissection. Cf. R.

In order both to expose the ventricles and to keep the subject alive, Galen must perform delicate and sophisticated surgery. Such procedures represent major operations on the brain.51 Galen recommends that 'for this purpose you must procure either a pig or a goat, in order to combine two requirements. In the first place, you avoid seeing the unpleasing expression of the ape when it is being vivisected. The other reason is that the animal on which the dissection takes place should ciy out with a really loud voice, a thing one does not find with apes'.52 Exposing the brain of a living animal clearly requires, at the very least, the same techniques refined upon the dead. The crucial difference between dissection and vivisection is that, in the latter, the skilled operator must also be prepared to deal with blood loss.53 That the animals survived the post-operative period for sufficient time for Galen to record any meaningful results is tribute to his operative skill and to his development of a set of techniques that minimised trauma and blood loss. With the top of the skull removed, haemostasis achieved in the living animal, and the dura mater opened (IX.12; 17-18), each step again emphasising Galen's technical proficiency, the brain is now exposed, and the animal examined for any adverse effects from the procedures so far executed: For the meninx as I described it is in all parts separable from it, as I have shown, except at the sides of the sutural lines which I indicated, where the meninx becomes folded into two layers as described, and sinks downwards penetrating a considerable distance further into the parts of the brain lying beneath it [falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli ] ... Now you can cut away these three parts of the meninx [dura mater ] and thus expose the under- lying portions of the brain. Two of these three parts lie in the region beneath the parietal bone, the third is the portion overlying the hind brain ( cerebellum ). When you have done that, then make an inspection and ascertain for yourself whether the animal is being 49 II 232 K. But Galen's scornful language does not show that they avoided all dissection, or even vivisection, but merely that they did not carry it out as he would have done.

Mani, 'Die wissenschaftlichen Grundlagen der Chirurgie bei Galen (mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der MM)' in Galen 's Method of Healing, ed. F. Kudlien and R. J. Durling (Leiden 1991) 26-49. Galen's experience in surgery as physician to the gladiators at Pergamům (157-161 AD) provided useful experience in dealing with wounds in living subjects, as well as valuable observations of patients' behaviour in wounds to the head. His anatomical skills, claimed Galen, won him this position at Pergamům. Cf. De optimo medico cognoscendo , CMG Suppl. Or. IV, 103.10-105.19. L. H. Toledo-Pereyra, 'Galen's Contribution to Surgery', JHM2% (1973) 357-75, claims to offer a summary of Galen's surgical skills, but draws many of his examples from the pseudo-Galenic Introductio sive medicus. 51 There is no evidence that Galen undertook his later experiments on the ventricular system, 'to verify the conclusions which he had already drawn from surgical experience', as R.

The latter may quite well be the case, when it happens that the air is warm.54 Galen is seeking to establish that, with the brain substance untouched, the animal's behaviour is unchanged. In the last sentence, Galen also implies that deleterious effects will not necessarily occur immediately, but 'soon afterwards' if the air is warm. The corollary is that cold air either increases the severity of distress shown by the animal, or else retards its recovery.55 Galen clarifies this by noting his observations on the effects of external temperature upon the exposed living brain; again, Galen attempts to minimise the number of outside influences on the brain before ventricular experimentation begins: But if the air is cold, then in a degree corresponding to the amount of the cold air streaming in upon the brain, each single one of these functions of the brain that we have mentioned weakens; the animal remains for a certain length of time unconscious, and then expires. Therefore it is best that you should take in hand the detachment of the dura mater from the skull in the summer time, or, if you perform it at another season, no matter which that season may be, you should heat the room in which you intend to dissect the animal, and warm the air.56 Once the brain of a living animal has been exposed, Galen documents the nature of the experiments he performs on its ventricles. It is worth quoting this passage in its entirety: Should the dissection be thus performed, then after you have laid open the brain, and divested it of the dura mater, you can first of all press down upon the brain on each of its four ventricles, and observe what derangements have afflicted the animal. I will describe to you what is always to be seen when you make this dissection, and also before it, where the skull has been perforated, as soon as one presses upon the brain with the instrument which the ancients call the 'protector of the dura mater'.57 Should the brain be compressed on both the two anterior ventricles, then the degree of stupor which over- comes the animal is slight. Should it be compressed on the middle ventricle, then the stupor of the animal is heavier. And when one presses down upon that ventricle which is found in the part of the brain lying at the nape of the neck (the fourth or posterior ventricle ), then the animal falls into a very heavy and pronounced stupor. This is what happens also when you cut into the cerebral ventricles, except that if you cut into these ventricles, the animal does not revert to its natural condition as it does when you press upon them. Nevertheless it does sometimes do this if the incision should become united.58 This return to the normal condition follows more easily and more quickly, should the 54 IX. 12; 18. 1 have added the final gloss [Duckworth]. 55 Cf. De loc. aff. VIII 161-62 K., where cold affecting the brain produces torpor and somnolence. 56 IX. 12; 18. 57 This is also known as the 'protector of the meninx', the meningophylax or membranae cusios (Celsus, Med. VIII.3). Galen here takes the opportunity to note similar effects from another procedure, trepanation. Galen refers to this instrument in a way that strongly indicates that it was something with which he was thoroughly familiar (cf. In Hipp. Epid. comm. III.l: CMG V. 10.2.1, 25). 58 Galen is deducing wound closure due to tamponade, where the brain substance overlying the ventricles seals the wound.</page><page sequence="11">JULIUS ROCCA: THE BRAIN BEYOND KÜHN 97 incision be made upon the two anterior ventricles. But if the incision encounters the middle ventricle, then the return to the normal comes to pass less easily and speedily.59 And if the incision should have been imposed upon the fourth, that is, the posterior ventricle, then the animal seldom returns to its natural condition; although nevertheless if the incision should be made into this fourth ventricle, provided that you do not make the cut very extensive, that you proceed quickly, and that in the compression of the wound in some way or other you employ a certain amount of haste, the animal will revert to its normal state, since the pressure upon the wound is then temporary only - and indeed especially in those regions where no portion of the brain overlies this ventricle, but where the meninx only is found. You then see how the animal blinks with its eyes, especially when you bring some object near to the eyes, even when you have exposed to view the posterior ventricle. Should you go towards the animal while it is in this condition, and should you press upon some one part of the two anterior ventricles, no matter which part it may be, in the place where as I stated the root of the two optic nerves lies, thereupon the animal ceases to blink with its two eyes, even when you bring some object near to the pupils, and the whole appearance of the eye on the side on which lies the ventricle of the brain upon which you are pressing becomes like the eyes of blind men.60 The above passage is without doubt one of the most impressive accounts of physiological experimentation extant in Western Antiquity. The claims made are far reaching and cannot be fully entered into here. But whether Galen deals with the effects of pressure or incision, the results are remarkable. His techniques are able to account for the function of each ventricle. This account should be read as a composite of Galen's brain investigations, since clearly they cannot have been the results of any single experiment. He presents his readers and students with a formidable - even overwhelming - combination of factors that few could manipulate successfully, let alone concurrently. Underlying this experimental tour de force is the message that failure to observe what Galen has expounded means only that the procedure has been improperly carried out; not that the methodology or the results can be called into question. These experimental and polemic techniques form the mainstay of Galen's experimental methodology of the brain.61 The rest of the brain is deliberately excluded from having a bearing on these experiments: ... the animal, when one pierces or incises the thin meninx, sustains no derangement as a result, just as none such befalls it if the brain should be incised without the incision reaching as far as to one of its ventricles.62 59 Galen does not formally quantify his observations, beyond noting the presence or absence of his key parameters of motion and sensation. An ambiguous estimation of the time taken to return to a normal state is as far as Galen goes in terms of attempting to quantify his results. On quantification in Antiquity see J. J. Bylebyl, 'Nutrition, Quantification and Circulation', BHM5' (1977) 369-85; Grmek, Il calderone di Medea , above, note 45; O. Temkin, 'A Galenic model for Quantitative Physiological Reasoning?', BHM 35 (1961) 470-75. 60 IX. 12; 18-19.

CMG V 4,2, 446,27-29.</page><page sequence="12">98 THE UNKNOWN GALEN In Anatomical Procedures , Galen also serves notice that his ventricular experiments may further be manipulated to produce a satisfactory outcome - a small incision, performed quickly and with prompt compression applied to the wound may result in the animal returning to its normal state.63 To stress that it is the ventricle, not the overlying brain substance, that determines function, Galen, later in Book IX, reiterates the consequences of incising the region of the posterior ventricle: ... that should the spinal marrow that lies between the skull and the first vertebra be severed, or the meninx which protects the end of the posterior ventricle of the brain be cut through, then at once the whole body of the animal becomes deprived of movement. It is just here that you will see, in the temples of the gods, the oxen receive the stab when the so-called sacrificers of oxen cut into them.64 Apart from experimental evidence, animal sacrifices yield for Galen important clues. The instantaneous death of oxen that occurs when the sacrificial cut is made at the level of the first cervical vertebra, is interpreted by Galen in terms of the topography of the posterior ventricle and its pneumatic contents, as the region incised is precisely where he maintains the posterior ventricle ends and the spinal cord begins.65 Erasistratus observed, as did Galen, that damage to the brain in the area of the first cervical vertebra, usually resulted in death. As that part so incised is indeed covered by dura mater, Erasistratus reasoned that death was due to damage to the dural meninx and made the valid empirical deduction that the dura was thereby responsible for nervous transmission in some way.66 To Galen, Erasistratus is almost correct; but the importance of damage to the meninx for Galen is that it exposes the posterior ventricle and its contents, as the posterior ventricle (according to him) empties via a single channel into the beginning of the spinal medulla.67 Galen validates his interpretation of these observations, and dismisses the Erasistratean thesis, by pointing out that damage to the meninx anywhere else does not result in the animal becoming motionless.68 If the effects of incising the ventricles are broadly similar to those elicited by pressure, it may be asked why Galen performs them. The answer lies in the nature of the contents of the ventricles. Ventricular incision is the first of a two-stage experimental process, the second of which creates the conditions for resealing the ventricle, allowing the animal to recuperate, and then observing the results in each case. These results are interpreted by Galen in pneumatic terms. That the animal recovers is ascribed to the replenishment of psychic pneuma following closure of the incised ventricle. Pneuma , however, is not mentioned in Anatomical Procedures , although, like Banquo's ghost, its presence may be felt. For 63 As expressed in De plac. Hipp, et Plat. CMG V 4,2, 442.30, an incision to the posterior (fourth) ventricle causes the most harm, with damage to the middle ventricle being the next most severe. 64 Admin, anat. IX. 14; 25. 65 Cf. Admin, anat. IX. 14; 25. It is well known to butchers that, 'the medulla may be cut by passing a knife between the skull and the atlas, less easily, between the atlas and axis.' R.

As we have seen, above, Galen had noted that an incision about the posterior ventricle renders the animal instantly motionless. It is the escape of pneuma that is responsible for this state. As he put it in On tremor , no other substance is as capable of emptying or collecting again so easily. Pneuma is also capable of moving into the body instantaneously ,69 This can be used to explain why the animal recovers when the incision has been sealed. For Galen, only pneuma accounts for the results of ventricular incision.70 His experiments indicate that damage to the brain - interpreted in terms of impairment affecting the ventricular system - produces a range of affective states (TraÔTÍpaTa) from reversible stupor to death. Galen creates a scale of function based on relative and absolute incapacity as recorded by experiment. It is the integrity of the ventricular system that is of first importance in maintaining the brain's role as hegemonikon of the rational soul. Contained within the ventricles, the position of psychic pneuma, however, is more problematic. Galen has several different theories for pneumatic action, but its precise manner of operation is something Galen never entirely resolves.71 IV This discussion has shown something of the comprehensive nature of Galen's edifice of the anatomy of the brain and the physiological argumentation he employs to establish its hegemonic status. Galen makes effective use of his anatomical materials. The head of the ape that is most like man is unrivalled as a learning template. The internal anatomy of the ape brain, is, however, another matter.72 In any case, Galen does not need to rely on the brain of an ape for detailed dissections of the structure and substance of the brain. He has a larger, more readily available subject for his studies in the ungulate, and it is this class of animal which provides the model for his construction of the anatomy of the human brain. Within that template, Galen provides a meticulously detailed account of ventricular anatomy and function. Here, of course, one is dependent both on the authority of Galen's descriptions and his experimental accounts. To be sure, only a skilled vivisector may with any confidence manipulate the subject material in such a way in order to exclude the meninx or the brain substance from having any bearing on the experiments. Such, at any rate, is Galen's intention and whilst his experimental methodology is internally consistent, the physiology behind it is necessarily speculative. However, since Galen places psychic pneuma , his chosen effector agent of the soul, within the ventricular cavities, he needs to show that the brain is the hegemonic organ of sensation and voluntary motion by experimenting on those parts of it 69 De tremore, palp, convuls. et rig. VII 596-97 K. The context is the role of pneuma as the cause of palpitation. At De plac. Hipp, et Plat. CMG V 4,2, 416.5-7, the heart is said to be the origin of the 'pneuma-like and boiling blood'. 70 Galen spells this out this relationship between the ventricle and its contents in PHP' CMG V 4,2, 446,11-17. Although this is a weak claim for pneuma per se , Galen ensures by this discussion that the argument for hegemonic ventricular function returns to its anatomical base. 7i See J. Rocca, 'Galen and Greek Pneuma Theory. The Limitations of Physiological Explanation', in Philosophy and Medicine. II. Studies in Greek Philosophy 29, ed. K. J. Boudouris (Athens 1998) 171-97. 72 This lack of attention to the base of the skull may further be inferred because Galen never provides an explicit citing of the lack of the retiform plexus in any dissection involving the brain of an ape. None of the anatomical descriptions Galen gives of the retiform plexus can be found to match conclusively any arterial structure of the base of the brain of an ape, whereas they point unequivocally to the ungulate.</page><page sequence="14">1 00 THE UNKNOWN GALEN amenable to his particular skills. It is therefore essential that the results from such experiments are comprehensible to Galen and to his audience: in other words, that such observations may be directly related to function. To this end, Galen devotes considerable effort in seeking to establish that the ventricles of the brain possess a set of distinct characteristics which eminently fit that organ for hegemonic status, and no other. To quote once more from Anatomical procedures (IX.7; 4), Galen states that it is: ... not here my purpose to derive the knowledge of the nature of the things which I wish to understand from analogy; for this is not the aim of anatomy. Rather I am simply trying to give an account of those things which manifest themselves to the eyesight. This is a typically Galenic statement. His anatomical epistemology and the strategies which underpin it, are, of course, far more complex than what he ostensibly maintains. Book IX of Hunayn's text at least allows us to see some of the ways in which he applies that knowledge. Refuting some and dazzling others, brain anatomy in Galen's hands is a powerful if selective tool. University of Cambridge and the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm.</page></plain_text>
