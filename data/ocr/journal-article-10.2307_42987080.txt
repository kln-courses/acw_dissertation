<plain_text><page sequence="1">Equipment &amp; New Products Training Robot Feedback Inc. introduces the ARM- DRAULIC MklII EHA 1052, a train- ing robot intended for use at all levels of instruction. The robot encourages structured experimentation and student project applications that simulate con- temporary industrial robots. The package includes a 356-page tu- torial manual, 250-page lab manual, 200-page instructor's guide, 400-page textbook, and demonstration/experi- mental programs on diskette. An op- tional videotape program with four cassettes and reference manual is also available. The two and one-half hour program was developed and produced in conjunction with a division of Gen- eral Motors. The anthropomorphic arm has six degrees of freedom (five axes plus gripper), and the hydraulic actuators and double- and single-acting cylinders offer continuous, absolute position feed- back on all axes and gripper. Retrofit kits are available to upgrade previous models.

It can be used to check the logic states of address lines, data lines, and any other general logic level line to detect a coincidence occurence of the same logic level on all eight input lines. It can also be used to trigger an oscilloscope or other test instrument. The probe is expandable in eight-bit blocks simply by using more ID-4804 probes in series. The device is portable and is powered by either a nine-volt transistor battery or any op- tional battery eliminator.

The unit features accu- rate temperature control to ±1° C and speeds to 12,800 rcf (10,000 rpm) to rapidly bring down suspensions, col- loids, precipitates, and other floes. An adjustable timer selects the interval for centrifugal action and a speed control permits speed settings in 20 increments of 500 rpm. The centrifuge maintains any tem- perature between 5° C and 80 ° C 472 JCST March/ April 1986</page><page sequence="2">Equipment &amp; New Producís within ±1° C. Up to 40 samples (0.4- ml centrifuge tubes) can be inserted into one of the nine available rotors for tubes from 0.4 ml to 15 ml. Cen- trifugal action separates the precipitate while the thermal system holds the temperature at the desired level for both product stability and repeatable results.

The short (75 -mm) col- umns feature high efficiency 3//m Ultrasphere packings that provide over 100,000 plates per meter. All four chemistries - C18, C8, CN, and Si - deliver the high reproducibility needed for QC/QA testing procedures. Ultrasphere-XL columns enable fast sample separations. Examples of run times include two minutes for steroids and two minutes for analgesics. Short- er run times mean reduced solvent con- sumption, higher throughput, and sub- stantial cost savings. The columns last up to four times longer than conventional columns. The tiny guard cartridge and 70-mm ana- lytical cartridge are designed to press- fit together with the holder. This car- tridge format reduces dead volume and eliminates the problem of decreased resolution and extracolumn effects as- sociated with conventional guards.

The first cartridge is a primary or roughing filter, which removes appre- ciable amounts of organics, free chlo- rine, chloramines, phosphate com- plexes, and turbidity before deionization takes place. The second and third stages are pol- ishing units utilizing ion exchange fil- ters, which reduce the ion concentra- tion of water to a level comparable to that of single-distilled water. All ioniz- able constituents are removed with the exception of free silica and carbon diox- ide. Water produced by these cartridges can then be directed to a still for further degassing and purification.

They are ideal for appli- cations requiring low wavefront distor- tion. The T27- and T28-Series laser col- limators use interchangeable entrance and exit lenses with air spaced optics for high-power capability. Pinholes yield an accurate Gaussian beam pro- file. Visible and ultraviolet models from 200 nm to 1,100 nm are available with magnifications from 3X to 30X with antireflection coatings optimized for 632.8 nm, yielding greater than 95 per- cent transmission. All collimators and beam expanders are tested interfero- metrically to verify diffraction-limited performance.

This is particu- larly useful where there is regular turn- March/ April 1986 JCST 473</page><page sequence="3">Equipment &amp; New Products over in staff or students with access to protected areas. With the Simplex, it is no longer necessary to change tumblers or make new keys. Key retrieval and inventory are eliminated, as is concern for key duplication. Combinations can be changed at regular intervals, or when- ever security must be increased. They can be set to use up to five numbers, to be pushed in sequence, in unison, or both ways. Thousands of combinations are possible. The lock is completely mechanical, requiring no electrical wiring or batter- ies. It is pickproof and weather resist- ant, and it has been tested for 1.5 mil- lion openings, equal to 30 years of intensive use. Installation is simple, using a tem- plate and following directions supplied with each lock. The only tools you need are a screwdriver, electric drill, and hole saw set. Prices start at $86.

Replacing fragile borosilicate glass (Type I) or flint glass (Type III) ampules or bot- tles, these are suited for small storage, shipping, packaging, or freezing. The bottles' polypropylene screw closures are engineered to provide a leakproof system. The bottles come in three high- purity, food-grade resins: Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) resists dilute, weak, strong, or concentrated acids, alcohols, and bases, and is useful over a temperature range of -100° C to +80° C. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) is resistant to nonoxidizing acids, alcohols, bases, and aromatic hydrocarbons, and is useful over a tem- perature range from -100° C to +120° C. Amber HDPE bottles are also avail- able to protect light-sensitive contents. These are more rigid than LDPE, impact resistant, and translucent. Polypropylene (PP) is autoclavable, rigid, and highly resistant to stress cracking. They resist nonoxidizing acids, alcohols, and bases, are translucent, and are useful over a temperature range from 0° C to +121° C.

Ice Cube-Powered Boat A miniature boat is powered by an ice cube for demonstrating a revolu- tionary concept of utilizing low-grade thermal energy. Developed by Innova- tive Technology International, the boat is known as the Cool-Craft. It operates by means of a single Nitinol wire looped around two wheels, which con- verts low-grade thermal energy into mechanical energy. Nitinol is a nickel- titanium alloy that reacts forcefully to a small change in temperature due to its memory effect, which causes the wire to always return to its original shape. In the process, it produces me- chanical energy. The 21.6-cm-long boat illustrates the Nitinol engine principle by operating between 35° C bath temperature and 0° C ice temperature. This tempera- ture differential causes the wire loop to spin and turn the propeller. The pro- peller turns as long as the wire is in contact with the ice. A Nitinol engine can operate at any temperature as long as there is a temperature differential of approximately 35° -40° C. Potentially, a multiwire or a full-size unit can generate power for industrial applications such as discarded indus- trial fluids, solar and geothermal heat, released heat from combustion engines, boilers, electric equipment, and com- puters.
