Press, 2002. ?40.00 (cloth), ?14.95 (paper) This entertaining book deals with kinship, class, and breeding through an ethnographic study of the racing industry, and, specifically, of the Newmarket stud farm and racing stables where the author worked as a stable lass ('lad'). It shows how horses and humans are described in terms of each other, and how social relations are seen as equine as well as anthropomorphic. It charts the ascending spirals of privilege that can be accessed by winning a big race, enabling a fortunate few (horses and humans) to move upwards towTards fame and fortune. In Newmarket (as elsewhere), appearances indicate wealth and lifestyles. For the lads, jockeys, and trainers, money, although the overt aim of the racing industry, is sought principally as a means of underpinning a horsey existence. Horses and humans interact with each other: horsiness is in the genes, 'in the blood', and not something that can be acquired or taught. Horsey people, like cen- taurs, are a race apart. So are thoroughbred racehorses, unlike the despised polo ponies and hacks that trot across the Newmarket landscape. Cassidy draws on the delineators of French and English kinship, and of proletar- ian and bourgeois lifestyles (such as Firth, Bott, Hoggart, Bourdieu, and Le Wita), to show how kinship, class, and breeding emerge through the behaviour, feeding habits, dress, and physical shape of the socialized body. These bodies range from the tall, thin, smartly turned out, quasi-aristocratic trainer, to the slight, hunched, underweight jockey, to the shapeless, nondescript lad. Cassidy rides well and works hard, display- ing a gutsy cheerfulness that helps her to be accepted into stud and stable. Her companions assume that she comes from a horsey family (all Irish are believed to have 'racing' genes). Her background is comfortable enough for her to move between different social groups, her authorial expertise deriving from her roles as owner, trainer, trainer's assistant, stable lass, and stud hand. In Newmarket, 'breeding' is all. Genealogies of humans, as well as horses, are freely dis? cussed, with the kinship networks of Baldings and other prominent families described to the newcomer. Non-horsey relatives are ignored. Yet despite the majority of the industry's support and stable staff being women, few women get to be trainers, and, even fewer, owners. Most of these are upper class and come from established racing families. Men tell Cassidy that this is the result of past prej- udice, which sounds suspiciously like telling the ethnographer what they think she wants to hear. That women need wealth and con- nections to succeed in the racing industry is perhaps too obvious to be considered worth saying. In the racing world, women and mares are seen as subservient to men and stallions, despite a widespread understanding of modern genetics. Traditionally, strength, speed, and racing talents come from the stallions, while weaknesses and difficult temperaments come from the mares. Females are seen prin- cipally as reproductive units, with race-mares described as neglectful mothers. Although some trainers use artificial insem- ination, others see it as unnatural and prefer to take their mares to a stallion. One of New- market's most respected stallion men cries 'Do it for Daddy', to encourage his charge during coverings. As one of his colleagues explains, 'Well, of course, Bob, has no kids of his own' (p. 134). The death of a mare is felt almost as a death in the family, while memorable race- winners and stallions, such as Mill Reef, live on in affectionate public memory. But at the end of the day this is a business with harsh imperatives, however much its par? ticipants identify themselves with the horses. Riding, horse care, and other activities have intrinsic rewards such as pleasure, deployment of technical skills, and lack of routinization. For this reason, the stable lads stay on in tough, poorly paid jobs, rather than earning more in factories. The enjoyment found in interacting with horses creates a mystique that helps confound the social and natural orders. Stable lads are seen as 'naturally' unambitious (by their social superiors), with women and mares considered 'naturally' weaker (by men), bloodstock agents have 'hunches' and 'natu? rally' recognize a potential winner. But in truth, no-one can recognize a winner in an untried yearling, even if a colt looks just like his illustrious sire, while much racing talk dis- guises the true nature of risk and probabili- ties.

This enjoyable book is recommended as a case study to those who wish to have some idea of the interaction of British class, capital, and kinship in the racing industry, without the financial outlay that hands-on experience requires.
