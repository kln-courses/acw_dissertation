<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Volume XXXVII APRIL 1957 Number 2 WHITEHEAD AND BERDYAEV: IS THERE TRAGEDY IN GOD? CHARLES HARTSHORNE* TYE obvious differences between A. N. Whitehead and Nicolas Berdyaev seem to have obscured their remarkable similarities. Thus, while one was logician and mathematician, the other was theologian and historian of culture. The one aimed at technical pre- cision and appealed mainly to the secular intelligence; the other frankly employed partly mythical language and appealed mainly to the Christian tradition. The Anglican background of Whitehead con- trasts with the Greek Orthodox back- ground of Berdyaev. (Curiously enough, both men did much of their work outside their native countries.) Neither writer seems to have had the slightest influence upon the other (Berdyaev was thirteen years younger, having been born in 1874). These may be the reasons why no one appears to have noted the profound co- incidence in the religious philosophy of the two seers, one of their common char- acteristics being that both seem to call for this appellation. The present discus- sion will focus attention on the similari- ties between the two thinkers, largely ignoring differences. First, we may observe that Berdyaev, although he writes as a Christian, is a man saturated with secular philosophy and culture; and Whitehead, although he never professes to be a Christian, has a deep and partly sympathetic awareness of the history of Christian doctrine. Both men accept as well as reject elements of such doctrine. Moreover, their rejections strikingly overlap. Both sharply and bluntly accuse their theological ancestors of having held a "despot" or "tyrant" conception of deity and consequently of having had, in Berdyaev's language, a "slavish religion."' Both feel that cruel and brutal aspects have not been lacking. Thus Berdyaev views the idea of hell as a piece of sadism; Whitehead says that "theories of atonement have been mostly crude" and that the Book of Revelation "illustrates the barbaric elements that have been retained to the undoing of the Christian intuition."2 Berdyaev, in strong language, expresses his scorn for the "disgusting" notion that the aim of life is to get one's self into heaven while * Charles Hartshorne is professor of philosophy at Emory University. He received his degrees, in- cluding Ph.D., from Harvard University. He has held teaching positions at the University of Chi- cago; Harvard University; Frankfurt, Germany; Melbourne, Australia; Leland Stanford University; and the New School for Social Research. With Paul Weiss he edited The Collected Papers of Charles S. Peirce, and with William L. Reese he is the author of Philosophers Speak of God. His books include The Divine Relativity and Reality as Social Process. Pro- fessor Hartshorne's articles have appeared in the Journal of Religion, the Hibbert Journal, and various other religious and philosophical periodicals. He has served as president of the Western Division of the American Philosophical Association, of the Charles Peirce Society, and of the Metaphysical Society of America. 71</page><page sequence="2">72 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION multitudes of one's neighbors are pushed into hell.3 Whitehead would think simi- larly, though perhaps he would go even further, since his theory of the individual as a "society" or sequence of experiences in a certain order and with a certain com- munity of quality inherited through the sequence puts him, if possible, in even sharper opposition to a self-interest the- ory of motivation, since "sympathy" is a metaphysical principle in his system.4 Berdyaev again speaks for both men when he says that there is a judgment of history upon the church, as well as of the church upon history. Neither thinker re- gards Christianity as a depository of in- fallible dictations from the divine to suitable officials, or even as a stream of unfailingly good lives. Both see our pious ancestors as a tragic blend of love and hatred, wisdom and folly, and their the- ologies as embodiments of this mixture. Berdyaev would hardly have been startled by Whitehead's query: "Must religion always remain as a synonym for hatred?"5 He himself declared that Christianity had made man worse as well as better and stated that theologians have "always" included immoral ele- ments in their moralizings. In short, both men take our religious tradition seriously, and both take it critically. Even when one passes to more techni- cal points of philosophical doctrine, the common basis of divergence from any usual "orthodoxy" continues to be im- pressive. Both view as supreme mistakes the denial of "movement" (Berdyaev),6 of "flux" (Whitehead),7 to the divine con- sciousness; and both oppose the assertion of God's sheer absoluteness, self-suffi- ciency, or inability to derive increase of value from the creatures.8 For both of them this is the technical expression of the tyrant idea of deity. The point is not a vague, merely emotional, one; nor is it simply a question of the nature of God's dealings with the world as just and mer- ciful or otherwise. The point is meta- physical: a despot is one who influences, while seeking to evade influence; who wishes, so far as possible, to exert, but never to suffer, power; who will be cause but not effect; who is the totally "inde- pendent" manipulator of things. This is the transcendentalized absolute negation of the principle of the democratic rule, which is that the ruler should in a sense also be subject and the subject in a sense also ruler. A responsible ruler is sensitive, responsive to the ruled, and this means that he is effect as well as cause. The three previous sentences have, so far as I know, no close equivalents in the writ- ings of the men we are considering, but both say things which imply that divine power escapes being despotic only be- cause it is not sheer power, sheer one- way causation, but is also receptivity and sufferance of causation. Both hold that God's creating of us is to be bal- anced against the correlative truth that we genuinely create something in God, so that God, in some elements of his life, is creature as well as creator.9 He is not "pure actuality" but involves inner po- tentiality.10 These seem to be ideas reached in complete independence but substantial agreement by the two authors. Let us now consider the common meta- physical notions forming the framework of this way of viewing deity. For White- head, there is an ultimate, though ab- stract, principle of all reality, a universal of universals, which he calls "creativi- ty."1' This he says is not identical with God, nor is it an individual, co-ordinate with or superior to God. It is a mere uni- versal or an ultimate abstraction, the ultimate abstraction. Like all universals, it is real only in individuals, including the</page><page sequence="3">WHITEHEAD AND BERDYAEV: IS THERE TRAGEDY IN GOD? 73 one essential individual, God. God is not identical with creativity, because you and I are creative too, with our non- divine but real creative action. White- head could perhaps here employ scholas- tic language and say that, just as in Thomism "being" is not simply the same in God and other things, so in his system "becoming" or "creativity," rather than mere being, is the supreme but analogical unity. What does Berdyaev say? When speaking metaphysically, he generally uses the term "freedom" rather than "creativity," but interchangeability of the two for him, and for Whitehead also, is not hard to establish. Freedom is that by which there can be creation of new realities. And Berdyaev tells us that this freedom is a principle uncreated by God and not identical with him and that the process of creation involves God, the un- created principle of freedom, and the creative and partly self-creative action of the creatures. God's "call to man" is not answered by God himself or by man us- ing solely elements which God has creat- ed in him but by man creating new reali- ties, new qualities of experience. This, of course, is thoroughly Whiteheadian. For Whitehead, the unit-actualities are "ex- perient occasions," which are always in some degree "self-creative," and each such occasion contributes to the divine consciousness, which regards it with "tenderness" after it exists and inspires it with his ideal for its coming-to-be as it comes into existence. Thus there quite definitely is a divine call and a creaturely answer. Largely common to both thinkers is the theory as to how evil arises. The par- ticular evils in the world are not brought into being by divine fiat but spring from freedom.12 Through freedom or creativi- ty, potential goods are made actual. But potential goods involve exclusive alter- natives, mutually incompatible possibili- ties of value. This is a root of tragedy in- herent in freedom and possibility as such and not due to any fiat of God. Actuali- zation is, in principle, exclusion not sim- ply of some evil but also of some good. Berdyaev says that true tragedy is not a clash of good with evil, but of good with good, of two equally noble ideals. White- head means the same thing when he says that evil is good out of season or in con- flict with some other good. He explains that values are, in principle, determinate and exclusive, always this but not that, in contrast to the realm of mere possibili- ties in which there is always both this and that. Actual value must always be finite, and "there is no infinitude of all perfections" (save as bare possibilities).'3 But, since freedom is not a single, indi- vidual power but an analogical universal embodied in many individuals, what is to prevent such individuals from pursuing incompatible values, so that A's success means B's failure and vice versa? The answer, most clearly set forth by White- head perhaps, is that nothing can wholly prevent this. No absolute co-ordinating of the acts of the various individuals can be effected. For they are free, incapable of being completely determined by an- other, even God. God inspires and influ- ences their acts-otherwise there would be no harmony whatever and no world order-but he cannot precisely and fully decide these acts, for they are in part self-decided and this self-decision cannot be delegated, even to deity.14 Thus the course of events is decided by no one in- dividual but is a multiple decision, and this not because of any weakness of deity but because of a certain strength or crea- tiveness of the creatures. Their creative- ness may be small and often, as Berdyaev says, imperceptible, but it is never zero. In the multiple-freedom or multiple-de-</page><page sequence="4">74 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION cision of actualization inheres an element of not wholly eradicable chaos. Chaos is multiple-decision so far as multiple. Only because there is a monistic aspect, the primary inspiration of deity upon all, is there anything but pure chaos. God is the orderer of the world (Whitehead), mak- ing the best use possible of the irrepress- ible part-chaos of free acts.15 Fate, says Berdyaev, is the "hardened outcome" of freedom, in interplay with Providence.1e Chance is real and a major cause of our suffering.17 A peculiarity of Berdyaev's language is his description of freedom as "not- being," which is yet distinguished from sheer nothing. It seems that only pure possibility, Whitehead's "pure poten- tials," can be thus intermediate between full actuality and nothing. A difference between the two metaphysicians is per- haps that for Whitehead there is a pri- mordial multitude of such potentials, "eternal objects," whereas Berdyaev would, I suspect, find this too Platonic. He complains that Platonic philosophy misses the truth that creation is the "production of new images," not the mere actualization of eternal patterns.18 Thus Berdyaev would perhaps say that freedom or creativity is the only eternal object. However, like Whitehead, he ascribes an eternal character, as well as movement and novelty, to God; and it would be a fine point to show how this differs from the "envisagement of all eternal objects," which, for Whitehead, constitutes this eternal or primordial divine character. The question seems to have only secondary interest for most of the issues I wish to discuss in this article. Both our authors conclude, from their theory of creativity, that tragedy is an ultimate principle, even for God.19 Alter- native possible values and multiple free- dom make the total avoidance of conflict unachievable; and even if the suppres- sion of freedom were possible, it would mean the extinction of good as well as of evil, since freedom is the common root of both. The tragic element of life which God cannot eliminate (since its elimina- tion is metaphysical nonsense) is not something simply external and indiffer- ent to God. God is not sheer cause, mere being, independent of all becoming and creating. He is relative to the world,20 for the merely absolute is "abstract" (the word is used in this connection by both our authors), deficient in inner life.21 True, both writers agree that God has an abstract aspect which is absolute, strictly eternal; but they insist that in his full concrete actuality he is receptive to the world's life, so that all creative action contributes something to the divine con- sciousness. We "enrich the divine life it- self" (Berdyaev);22 God has concrete ("physical") perceptions ("prehen- sions") of events (Whitehead) which form the content of his "Consequent Na- ture," which is conscious. But in this way our griefs as well as our joys are commu- nicated to God. He intuits and thus shares in our tragedies.23 The course of history, says the Russian seer, is a divine as well as a human tragedy.24 Whitehead is somewhat less emphatic about this, but the doctrine is common to the two men. One recalls Whitehead's description of God as "fellow-sufferer"; his declara- tion that the attribution of "mere happi- ness" to deity is a "profanation" and that we may employ the human analo- gies of "tragedy, sympathy, and actu- alized heroism" as among the least in- adequate.25 Here, then, are two great minds of our time who think that the Christian idea of sacrificial or suffering love has even more direct and ultimate validity in theology than orthodox sys- tems have supposed. Of course, Schelling</page><page sequence="5">WHITEHEAD AND BERDYAEV: IS THERE TRAGEDY IN GOD? 75 had said much the same, as well as Fechner and others. Berdyaev knew much of this tradition; I do not know whether or not Whitehead did. In any case, the doctrine has now a new weight and dignity. An interesting remark of Berdyaev's is that the famous Nygren dichotomy-- Eros or Agape?-overlooks pity, which is neither and than which, he thinks, noth- ing in man is higher. Whitehead actually uses Eros as a symbol for God in a few passages,26 though it is plain that for him there is an infinite contrast between hu- man "desire" and the divine "appeti- tion" and "tenderness." He frequently uses the word "love" in theological refer- ence. On the whole, no determinate dif- ference between the Russian and the Anglo-American can be established here. A methodological difference of some importance is that Berdyaev seems to re- gard the identification of God with the pure "absolute" as philosophically de- fensible, though theologically vicious. He says that, to appreciate the necessity or possibility of movement, potentiality, and relativity in God, we must transcend mere rationalism. Whitehead, on the contrary, holds that the attempt to treat deity as wholly without flux is contrary to reason, since it prevents us from con- ceiving the relations between the world and God without "contradictions at every step.""27 He thinks it is rationalism and not just religious feeling or insight that demands the conception of God as self-related and hence relativized to the world, receptive of its values, its joys, and its sorrows. Berdyaev seems at times to see this superior rationality of the rela- tive concept; but at other times he re- verts to his irrationalistic spiritualism, which professes to accept the divine rela- tivity and flux in spite of reason.28 Here I think it is Whitehead who is right. Not reason but certain unthinking prejudices resulted in the absolutistic view. A cer- tain etiolatry (worship of cause),"2 or on- tolatry (worship of being),"3 or monola- try (worship of unity) in contrast to ef- fect, becoming, and diversity-these and other similar forms of philosophical idol- atry, resulting not from calm analysis but from ecstatic enthusiasm for certain one-sided conceptions, constitute the origin of what Berdyaev too flatteringly labels "rationalism." A similar difference obtains in the treatment of "pantheism."31 Berdyaev holds that reason gets into difficulties in trying to conceive of the world as con- tained in God but that it is nevertheless a mystical or religious truth that the world enters into the divine actuality. (Here Berdyaev is following the Russian theologian, Soloviev, as well as German mysticism.) Rationalism is compelled, he suspects, to oscillate between a religious- ly impossible dualism-of a merely abso- lute God who does not include the world in his reality-and a no less impossible pantheistic monism. The monism must deny human freedom-and, indeed, all freedom;32 and the dualism, if it does nominally admit freedom, renders it without ultimate significance, since in the rigidity of the divine absoluteness there can be no open alternatives, and hence it can never make any difference to deity what course the expression of freedom may take. Berdyaev's conclusion is that freedom is an irrational, which can be dealt with only in "mythical" terms of spiritual experience, not in terms of con- cepts accessible to secular thought.33 Here again I think Berdyaev is some- what confused, in comparison with Whitehead. Logical analysis shows, as I have argued elsewhere," that the usual alternative of theism-pantheism is inex- haustive and that the absurdities of both</page><page sequence="6">76 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION positions can be avoided by rejecting their common premise, which is that the supreme reality is to be conceived by favoring one pole of the ultimate con- traries, such as being-becoming, abso- lute-relative, necessary-contingent, as against the other. Reason itself leads us, I hold, to accept the law of polarity, which finds the ultimate meanings in terms of the contrast between such po- larities, not in either pole itself. There can be no mere being, or mere absolute, or mere necessity. Moreover, becoming, relativity, and contingency are irrational only for a spurious "reason." Reason is tracing of relations; for it to deny rela- tivity is fantastic. Open alternatives are inherent in mathematics itself; and the whole apparatus of logic and mathemat- ics has no other "function" (the very word expresses "becoming") than to in- terpret becoming in some aspect. The best authorities are coming to see that even Newtonian physics cannot be rigor- ously deterministic, that physics cannot dispense with the notion of potentiality and of ranges of alternative possibilities or "degrees of freedom." Also, it is be- coming clear that "things" or "beings" are known as functions of process, not process as function of beings. We are gradually learning that the contrast of being-becoming, absolute-relative, neces- sary-contingent, is contained as a whole in becoming, relativity, contingency, not in being, absoluteness, necessity. The final words are process, relativity, or freedom just because these can (indeed, logically must) contain in themselves aspects of permanence, absoluteness, or necessity; whereas within the merely per- manent nothing can change, and no con- stituent of an absolute and necessary whole can be relative or accidental. There is nothing illogical or irrational about the idea of open alternatives as containing something common to them all, and thus necessary. A synthesis of the polar contraries by this path is not in defiance of, but in accord with, reason and demanded by it. The doctrine which avoids both the difficulties which Berdyaev finds in pan- theism and those he finds in the usual or classical theism had better be called "panentheism" than "pantheism," for both etymological and historical reasons. It posits an eternal absolute abstract es- sence in a God who, in his full concrete actuality or process of experience, in- cludes all contingent things, as inessen- tial but not, for all that, unreal properties -in other words, accidents. I could still be myself, were it not just now true that the chirp of a sparrow comes to me from outside the house. The sensation of this sound is not essential to me, to my being "myself." But there is nothing unreal about the sensation as a constituent of my actual experience. Inessential is one thing; unreal is another. So God has a multitude of inessential real properties or accidents. In these real accidents, contin- gent things are contained as data of the divine consciousness, in such fashion that God is active as well as passive in regard to them. He suffers our actions, he does not enact them, and that is how they can still be our actions, though they enter into his experience. This is Whitehead's doctrine, and he offers it as the outcome of rationalism, not its defiance. To call this doctrine "irrational" or "contradictory" (as some would do) be- cause it makes the absolute God relative or the perfect God imperfect is question- begging sophistry. For nothing compels the panentheist to suppose that God, or any existent entity, is in all aspects abso- lute or perfect, in the sense of "at an ab- solute maximum" or "incapable of in- crease." There is another sense of perfect</page><page sequence="7">WHITEHEAD AND BERDYAEV: IS THERE TRAGEDY IN GOD? 77 which the panentheist regards as the the- ologically fundamental one, namely, "in- capable of being rivaled (equaled or sur- passed) by another individual." God is the object of worship: since it is other in- dividuals than God who do the worship- ing, if God is exalted above others be- yond the possibility of rivalry, then God is indeed God, the appropriate object of universal reverence; and there is no con- tradiction in supposing that, although in no aspect can God be rivaled by another individual, he can in some aspect surpass himself by growing in content. Fechner (perhaps not read at all by Berdyaev or Whitehead) seems to have been the first, unless it was Schelling, to discern this meaning of "perfect" and its relevance for religion. Of course, to relate this analysis to Whitehead in detail, it would be neces- sary to make explicit his theory of the in- dividual as a "personally ordered socie- ty" or linear sequence of experiences. Berdyaev is not concerned with this problem and seems not sharply commit- ted either for or against Whitehead's analysis. In view of his emphasis upon perpetual creation of new realities, how- ever, it seems he ought to accept the Whiteheadian view that the final con- crete realities are experient occasions, not enduring individuals. But it is well to admit in passing that Berdyaev falls into some strange phrases about the creation of the soul "in eternity" that appear to contradict all this. Yet, before taking this difficulty too seriously, we need to in- quire into the meaning of "eternity" for this author. Both writers sometimes seem to treat God as simply non-temporal, as though they accepted the venerable notion that the contrast between being and becom- ing is invidious, with the superiority all on the side of becoming. But both authors make amends for this in other passages. Berdyaev puts it well with his distinction between integrated and dis- integrated time.35 For us the past tends to be negligible and pale in content, be- cause of our eager concentration upon the present, and our anxiety about the fu- ture. But this is our human deficiency, not an absolute metaphysical principle. The highest mode of experience would retain vivid interest in the past and would create ever new values in the pres- ent but would be free from distracting anxiety concerning the future. The theo- ry is not very fully sketched, but this seems to be the intention." There is a "divine history" as well as a human one; but the divine history is that of growth without loss and without distracting anxiety, although not without suffering, owing to the actual conflicts between creaturely volitions and actions. Thus "eternity," in the previous paragraph, may refer to integrated, rather than dis- integrated, time. Whitehead's view seems similar. He terms "everlastingness" the power of re- taining experiences in their full immedia- cy as elements in subsequent experiences containing also novel elements-in short, the growth of experience without loss, ad- dition without subtraction.37 The denial of loss is unequivocal so far as concerns God's relation to his own previous expe- rience, but there is some uncertainty or wavering as to how completely the past of the world is preserved in God. There is a saving of "what can be saved." There are reasons against taking this to mean that something is dropped out. It might rather mean that, although the whole of each event is taken into God and pre- served there, some of the desires and pur- poses for the future which the event con- tained must, because of incompatibility, be frustrated.38 We do not accomplish all</page><page sequence="8">78 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION that we sought to accomplish, but our actually achieved feelings and thoughts are imperishable."3 One reason support- ing this interpretation is the saying that the truth itself is only how things are in the Consequent Nature of God,40 for then it cannot be true that something is left out. A slight difference, at least of empha- sis, between the Whiteheadian meta- physics and that of Berdyaev is this, that, in the former, creativity is some- times spoken of as though it were a sort of power alongside God, so to speak; whereas Berdyaev says that freedom, though not divinely created, is still in the Godhead, a primordial element of his reality as conceived in mystical panthe- ism.41 Berdyaev is here influenced by Boehme and Schelling. Whitehead can, without much difficulty, be assimilated to this point of view. For he does say that the Consequent Nature is the unification of all things; so, surely, creativity is in- cluded. What Whitehead wants us never to forget is simply that the divine sort of creating, which, like all creating, in- volves an aspect of self-creation, is not the only sort of creativity. All actualities are "self-created creatures." Creativity is analogical, not just univocal, in that it is both divine and non-divine. But, for all that, all creativity may be in God; for, since he is active as well as passive, he can contain creative decisions he does not make. He contains his own divine de- cisions as making them and non-divine ones as suffering them. Fechner was per- haps the first to expound this idea with some clarity. Putting it another way, a perception or prehension includes its data, and a subject includes its prehen- sions. The correlation subject-object be- longs, with both its terms, to the subject rather than to the object. God as ade- quate cosmic subject, correlative in a unique way to the total universe of lesser realities, includes all instances and kinds of creativity, either as his own act-forms or as their contents. Thus God is all in all, and this without prejudice to crea- turely freedom and individuality. One might go so far as to say that "creativity" and "freedom" are simply aids to our understanding in trying to conceive the divine life as genuinely re- lated to our lives and to all lives. If we understand well what "God" means, we know all that can be conveyed by "free- dom" or by "non-divine creatures." There is nothing but God, as necessarily existing but contingently experiencing ourselves and other things. No power and no obstacle oppose deity, and noth- ing conditions him, except as you and I and other more or less free sequences of actualities oppose or condition him. Thus there is no new problem, but the old standard problem of God and the world, approached, however, with new means of analysis. That God cannot extinguish freedom and hence cannot extinguish all evil is no external constraint upon him but just his own essence. It is his eternal essence to be free himself and to deal with free creatures, some creatures or other, but not necessarily just these or those. God has not and cannot have any wish that there be no free creatures; there is no motive or possible desire for an alternative to freedom, which is the root of all good as well as of evil. The only "constraint" here is upon our own confusion, which may lead us verbally to suppose an alternative to freedom. Thus the familiar query "Why did God make free beings, with all the dangers this in- volved?" is meaningless, since it supposes an alternative where there is none. Pos- sible alternatives are within freedom, not to it. The very idea of making or of power presupposes a free individual, God, as</page><page sequence="9">WHITEHEAD AND BERDYAEV: IS THERE TRAGEDY IN GOD? 79 already actual and hence already in rela- tion to other free beings, furnishing de- terminate individual objects of aware- ness. Other "persons" in a trinitarian godhead are not enough; for what prin- ciple of individuation could really distin- guish and give determinate content to three beings, all divine, all with adequate awareness of all truth, and yet in rela- tionship to nothing except each other? Both our philosophers see deep wis- dom, but misinterpreted wisdom, in the orthodox theory of the Trinity. White- head says that the principle of mutual immanence between individuals first ap- peared in this theological guise but needs to be made a general metaphysical prin- ciple, replacing the old theory of sub- stances not immanent to each other.42 Berdyaev says that the theory of divine begetting of Son and Holy Ghost implies an admission of relativity and of becom- ing in the divine life, which needs to be completed by admitting also a receptivi- ty toward the creaturely becoming, whereby the latter can contribute con- tent to the divine becoming.43 Our two authors both speak of God as creator, but neither accepts without qual- ification the doctrine of creation ex nihilo as the distinguishing feature of the divine action.4 Both the statement that man creates only by modifying a given mate- rial and the statement that God's crea- tion presupposes nothing but the divine power are alike found unacceptable as they stand. The notion that a new expe- rience or event is merely a new predicate of a material already there is confused, as Whitehead has shown.45 It conveys no positive insight, since we can perceive or conceive nothing that makes the "mat- ter" the same before and after it has the new quality or shape. That such an ac- count is purely verbal is virtually admit- ted by Aquinas when he says that we can never know prime matter directly but only by analogy, as with the clay which is in the hands of the potter. But this merely restates the question, which is, What constitutes the identity of the clay in successive events? And, besides, if the same entity really "has" both earlier and later events, then time is frozen and de- natured, since it falls within an identity. If we drop these verbalisms, all we have is that human creating makes use of, or profits by, antecedent events. If, and only if, such and such has already hap- pened, can certain human acts now hap- pen. This is what we know positively. The final actualities are events, and the events we know vividly are those consti- tuted by occasions of human experience. If, then, Beethoven had power in part to determine his own musical experiences, in so far he had power to create not mere adjectives of some actuality but actuali- ties themselves. How far is it different with divine acts? The most obvious difference is that, although any act of God creative of pres- ent actuality in the world presupposes (as we shall see in a moment) earlier events as having already occurred, it does not presuppose occurrences prior to the very existence of God, for deity is primordial and ungenerated; whereas our acts, on the contrary, always depend upon events, some of which were ante- cedent to our personal existence alto- gether. Divine acts refer only to ante- cedent events which themselves also em- bodied divine acts. Anything which God in a given phase requires has also re- quired him in a previous phase of his life. This is not the case with us and our re- quirements. So creation ex nihilo may be taken as an elliptical way of stating that the divine action presupposes nothing anterior to God himself.</page><page sequence="10">80 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION That divine creation, at least of pres- ent actualities in the world, does presup- pose previous events seems evident if we look beyond mere words and try to form even the vaguest conception of what the words mean. Does God make the mature man out of nothing or out of the imma- ture man? Surely the latter. It is a down- right contradiction to think of adult memories of childhood made not out of childhood but out of non-entity. To be "remembered," in the proper sense, the earlier events must have occurred. (For Whitehead, the mother is unconsciously remembered by the infant, and no abso- lute beginning is reached.) Earlier events are data required to give content for the present event-if you will, its presup- posed materials. The later events are not, for all that, just these same materials acquiring new qualities. They are new actualities, having some qualities of the earlier ones and also novel qualities. It seems self-evident that a single new qual- ity means a new total reality. The whole A b is not identical with the whole A, no matter now insignificant the b may be. But did not God create the first events, the first state of the world, out of nothing? It seems the answer must be Yes, provided that there was a first state. But why assume this? A first moment could have no memories, and an experi- ence without memory is not an experi- ence in any recognizable Whiteheadian sense. (Berdyaev seems not to have talked to this point; but I am at least not sure he would have held a radically differ- ent view.) Indeed, a first state of the world would be utterly unlike anything we can conceive. It would point to no prior events. If Adam had a navel, this pointed to his having had a mother; if not, was he a man? The father of Ed- mund Gosse worried about this for years, until he arrived at the "solution" that God had no choice but to create a first state of the world looking in all respects as though it had not been the first state. He was compelled to practice a gigantic deception upon human scientists. But perhaps that is a reductio ad absurdum of the notion of a first state. Present-day physicists have some ingenious sugges- tions here, but we cannot pursue the matter further. Apart from a hypothetical, if at all con- ceivable, first event, God, as well as man, creates with reference to events already in being, thus not out of nothing, al- though in the divine case the reference is never to events that precede his own ex- istence. Of both the divine and the ordi- nary creative action the result is a new actuality, not merely a new adjective of an old actuality. In spite of these analo- gous factors, there is an infinite, not a merely finite, superiority in the divine action, since the latter operates cosmical- ly and not locally, always and not some- times, with invincible power to achieve its basic objective-the perpetuation of the cosmic process for the benefit of the creatures and the enrichment of its own life-and since the divine action at each moment involves a new phase of the di- vine experience, which alone is an ade- quate perception of all space and all past events. It is too often forgotten that there is no logical need to choose between an absolute and a merely finite difference, since there is the intermediate case of an infinite (yet not absolute) difference. One may contrast infinity and zero, or a large finite and a small finite, or, finally, infini- ty and the finite. The old view was that God had infinite power, we no power, to turn nothing into something; the differ- ence was absolute. But suppose we have a finite power to turn nothing (that is, potentiality, which is at least no deter- minate-being) into something; it does</page><page sequence="11">WHITEHEAD AND BERDYAEV: IS THERE TRAGEDY IN GOD? 81 not follow that God differs from us "merely in degree" of power, if that means merely finitely. Between an infi- nite degree and any finite degree there is an infinite difference. That God always has a definite potentiality-that is, past events as data-to work with does not make his power merely finite. Power con- sists in ability to use data to make new actualities; infinite power to do this means ability to do it primordially and everlastingly and to achieve always and infallibly a personal synthesis of the data which could not be rivaled by any other person and which then enters subcon- sciously into all lesser creative action and thus guides the world in the light of its history. Something like this is what Whitehead and Berdyaev substitute for the too simple doctrine of creation ex nihilo. Let us now consider the attitude of our authors toward ethical questions. Berdya- ev wants us to be creative and to cherish creativity in others, to love each other as beings creative on the ultimate meta- physical level of adding to the divine life itself. He rejects the aspects of intoler- ance, envy, egotism, legalism, moralism, which have so often disfigured Christian ethics and made it seem almost irrelevant to man's spiritual adventure in art, sci- ence, statesmanship, and other fruitful endeavors. Such endeavors are not to be viewed as mere obedience to God (why should he care about such mere obedi- ence?) but as means of enriching his life by virtue of his loving participation in ours. Whitehead's view seems about the same. He says that we need patterns of social order, which must change from time to time to maintain their freshness of interest, but that the criterion of the value of an order is its contribution to in- dividual lives as appreciated through love and as finally appropriated forever by the divine love."4 There seems to be a difference between the two men in so far as Berdyaev exhibits a note of asceticism in regard to sex (seemingly contradicted in some places) which I do not find in Whitehead. The latter's warning against contentment with "obvious enjoyments" does not seem equivalent to Berdyaev's statement that in sex pleasure there is always poison.47 On the whole, however, the general harmony between the two thinkers applies also to their ethical views. Of course, one could systematically emphasize the differences, particularly of terminology, between Russian and Eng- lishman, just as I have emphasized the similarities. Granting this possibility, I do wish to maintain the significance of the convergence which I hope I have demonstrated. We have illustrated here a new philosophical and religious climate of opinion, in which the long-reigning bias toward cause-worship and being- worship or, in plainer English, worship of sheer power no longer plays a role. A great change has taken place. It is now possible to be conscious of the difference between the worship of peace, eternity, being, security, independence, oneness, absoluteness, activity, cause, and the worship of God, who to men like Berdya- ev, Whitehead, Schelling, and many others is something very different-yes, infinitely different-from these one-sided qualities. It is now open to us to use con- cepts of process, becoming, self-creation, receptivity, complexity, relativity, pas- sivity, sensitivity, effect, and tragedy (without, however, any invidious exclu- sion of their contraries) as aids to expres- sion of our sense of the individual whose majesty is exalted beyond possible rival- ry, the all-worshipful God. We do not have to worship power or "complete- ness" or inability to grow in content or</page><page sequence="12">82 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION an exhaustive (and therefore self-contra- dictory) actualization of value. Rather we worship love, including sensitivity, responsiveness, and infinitely delicate way of appropriating and preserving created values, of synthesizing ever new phases of itself as sole adequate effect of all antecedent causes (and, therefore, supreme cause of all subsequent effects), uniquely complex, uniquely integrated, matchlessly subtle in passivity to its data. All this stands in no conflict with the idea that God is in every way unri- valed by others, actual or possible. He is unrivaled temporally; for no other is pri- mordial and everlasting, no other has an individual character with essential traits that cannot alter-for example, the trait of immunity to rivalry itself. (The sup- position that the world has no beginning or ending in time does not mean that there is an individual other than God with equally universal temporal scope, for "the world" is not an individual but simply "all individuals other than God.") It is a vital discovery, I suggest, that the thesis of etiolatry, the denial of rela- tivity and process to God, cannot be de- duced from the religious idea that God is the all-worshipful, that is, the one to whom there cannot be a rival. This dis- covery sets us free from the supposed necessity to worship mere power or self- sufficiency. The causative power of God is really due, we may believe, to his unique facility in responding as effect to all things as causes, that is, to his loving appropriation of all lives. God has power over us because we cannot but love him, at least unconsciously. "The power of God is the worship he inspires" (Whitehead), and we love him not because he is in some other sense powerful or because he is un- affected by, and thus neutral with re- spect to, worldly alternatives but rather because he is the fulness of loving sym- pathy and sensitivity, so that alterna- tives in the world make more difference to him than to anyone else; for only he can adequately appreciate the scope of these alternatives."4 Thus he is the least neutral or "independent" of any indi- vidual in his actual concrete experience, and, for that very reason, in his essential abstract individuality (common to all experiences possible for him) he is the most neutral or strictly independent. Whatever happens, God, with his previ- ously acquired values, will persist be- cause he cannot lose his unlimited passive power of receiving any cosmic datum whatever into his consciousness. He can, it is true, receive it only for what it is worth, and we serve him by making it worth all that we can; but it will in any case be an enrichment without prejudice to the values already enjoyed. Our own passive power is infinitely inferior. We must often lose consciousness and always must forget nearly all the past, when con- fronted with new data. The question never is Will the divine experience be divine, or will it receive all the particu- larity of the world? It is rather how much enrichment over previous divine experi- ence will result, and how much there will be divine joy rather than divine sorrow. Indifference to suffering rather than suf- fering as a result of loving sympathy with the sufferers should be rejected as unworthy to be predicated of God. An objection sometimes made to the notion of divine suffering is that one can help sufferers better if one does not feel their pangs. This is a good test case for the question as to where the real danger of anthropomorphism in theology lies. Let us first note that we men have very limited passive powers. If we take in strong feeling from one other person, we can take in very little else; and we have</page><page sequence="13">WHITEHEAD AND BERDYAEV: IS THERE TRAGEDY IN GOD? 83 little energy left over to react creatively, to explore possibilities, to think clearly. This limitation as to scope of passivity and as to total energy is our real weak- ness, not the passivity itself. If it were the passivity, then an insect would be vastly stronger than we; for surely we have a much greater scope of passive sensitivity than an insect! We are more variously passive and more variously ac- tive than an ant. There is no contradic- tion in this. God, having unlimited scope of passive reception, can always assimi- late any presented datum, including any strong emotion of another, and yet retain full freedom of attention for all other data and all relevant possibilities of crea- tive reaction thereto. "God," says White- head, "is the evaluation of the world,""49 limited only in his presented content, not in his power to do it justice. To "adapt" with matchless efficiency to every state of affairs is not to be con- cretely uninfluenced by such states, is not to be in every sense independent of them, but it is to be totally secure of per- sonal survival and integrity and in that sense totally independent of all occur- rences. All this is only what "omnis- cience" means when interpreted without etiolatrous precommitment. Let us sum up. For Whitehead and Berdyaev, God is not cause rather than effect, being rather than becoming; nei- ther is he effect rather than cause, be- coming rather than being. He is supreme in all these respects. Since all the basic conceptions are used, none is viewed idolatrously as synonymous with God. All must be supplemented by their con- traries; for deity transcends these con- trasts because his unrivaled majesty is found at both poles of the categorical contraries. (Ethical evil is not categori- cal, but a special case of the truly cate- gorical principles, and in this it is unlike suffering, which is universal in scope. I omit discussion of this point, which is similar to Berdyaev's "tragedy lies be- yond good and evil.")"' If we follow these two guides, we shall worship the unrivaledness, the supreme excellence, of the divine cause-effect, ac- tivity-passivity, which alone makes God worthy of universal reverence. We shall present our lives to him as all that we have with which to serve him in the only way in which an individual whose es- sence is love can be served, namely, by the production of happiness in individu- als other than himself, and we shall try to avoid causing him to suffer in the only way in which he can be caused to suffer, through the unhappiness or non-fulfil- ment of these other individuals. We wor- ship in deity an unqualified independence of essence and existence, his Primordial Nature, which is absolute, necessarily existent, but abstract; and we worship an equally matchless receptivity, passive power or derivativeness of experience, his Consequent Nature, which is relative, contingent, concrete, and actual (not merely "existent," since this means only that the essence is embodied in some suit- able actual experience or other). Finally, in the words of Berdyaev, "we can only reconcile ourselves to the tragedy of the world because God suffers in it too. God shares his creatures' destiny.""51 Or, in the words of Whitehead, "God is the fellow- sufferer who understands."52 NOTES 1. Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas (hereafter abbreviated "A. of I.")
