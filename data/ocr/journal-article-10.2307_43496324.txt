<plain_text><page sequence="1">Arthur W Frank, Letting Stories Breathe:A Socio-Narratoiogy , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 20 10; 209 pp., US$25.00 (hbk) Reviewed by: Natasha Azarian-Ceccato, Department of Communication , SKEMA Business School, Sophia Antipolis, France Letting Stories Breathe is a concise and lovely read for both students and seasoned nar- rative analysts. Throughout the book, Arthur Frank infuses stories of his own as well as examples from literature to illustrate his points. This feature makes the book less pedantic and more of a lively read for narrative scholars. The book begins with an informative introduction which sets the stage for the follow- ing six chapters, some which read like vigorous lecture notes from one of Frank's classes, and others which read more like a handbook of gentle reminders and useful advice when conducting narrative research. While all the chapters of the book are relevant to narrative study, I found the introduction followed by first four chapters to be most pertinent to those in the process of conducting narrative research.</page><page sequence="2">Book reviews 671 In the introduction, Frank brings in six examples from literature, ranging from Fredrick Douglass to Maxine Hong Kingston. These six stories serve distinct purposes, from demanding to be retold, or its opposite, to inform without retelling. Offering con- crete examples allows the complexity of narrative analysis to become more lucid for those new to the discipline. Frank takes a post-structuralist position, making the point that 'people grow up being cast into stories, as actors cast into their parts in a play' (p. 41), but he contends that this metaphor is too deterministic, and echoing others in linguistic anthropology (Ochs and Capps, 2002) reminds us that stories don't just report on past events, they also project potential futures. In Chapter 1 and throughout the book, Frank explains and defends the book's subtitle of 'socio-narratology'. The anthropomorphic metaphor of 'letting stories breathe' is traced back to socio-narratology because it 'lets stories breathe by studying how they can do what they can do' (p. 17). Once one has understood this link, the implications for research, especially as it applies to narrative analysis and collective memory, are vast. The link between narrative templates and culture is relayed consistently throughout the book as are the ever-evolving life spans that stories can take as they breathe and acquire new tellers. In Chapter 2, Frank presents valuable narrative nomenclature, which is one of the reasons why this book could serve as a handbook for those about to embark on narrative research. Drawing on Bourdieu (1977), he employs the term narrative habitus which is the compilation of stories which maintain and shape our lives. Narrative habitus is stories that are part of us, stories that we hear and are immediately disposed to. A narrative habi- tus entails knowing what story to repeat and under what circumstances, which is often the focus of narrative analysis as it pertains to community and memory (Azarian-Ceccato, 2010). Frank illustrates conundrums for narrative analysts, rather than commenting on redundancies within the field. For example, drawing on Linde (2008), Frank examines the relationship between memory and narrative. He questions what it means for a person to 'remember' something that s/he hasn't experienced, but is encouraged to remember for communal, nationalistic or civic purposes. Frank suggests that there are circum- stances when a story can be incorporated into one's narrative habitus. In these situations it is as if one lived through the story, because it occupies an important role in one's sense of self, whether it is related to a source of employment or other things. Chapter 3 focuses on dialogical narrative analysis as method. This chapter is infused with various examples, but also serves the function of illustrating how one might conduct narrative analysis - an invaluable tool for those in the field. While Frank provides useful guidelines, he refrains from being prescriptive. He calls dialogical narrative analysis 'a practice of criticism' in which 'movements of thought' are sought out, and as a result, certain questions surface which are then emphasized (or not) by the analysts (p. 74). These questions revolve around the social, and examine such lines of inquiry as who tells the story to whom and what is at stake for those present when the story is told. These aren't easy questions to answer, but Frank lays a foundation which guides students of narrative involved in research, who face these exact issues. The focus of Chapter 4 is the dialogical interpretation of stories and their particular truth. Frank draws on Bakhtin's (1982) notion of dialogism as well as examples from</page><page sequence="3">672 Discourse Studies 1 4(5) literary criticism to assist in the interpretation endeavor. Concerning truth, Frank argues that no one ever has the entire story, whether the story is published, told as ritual, or expressed in an interview. Furthermore, Frank offers 'comforting' advice to the narrative researcher who may be faced with the question of 'so what' concerning his research: 'The capacity of stories is to explore complications, rarely to resolve them' (p. 1 10). Chapter 5 presents exemplars of narrative analysis and Chapter 6 examines the com- plex questions of how people grow with or are inculcated with different stories. These chapters are noteworthy in their own right; however, they seem less pertinent to the ques- tion of how to do narrative analysis, which is what I see as the major contribution of this book to the field. This book offers a fresh perspective and a needed new twist to narrative analysis. It is a book I would have welcomed as a graduate student conducting my own narrative research, and it is a book that I would recommend to students, as a professor in this field.
