<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS EXCAVATIONS AND SURVEYS Tel Hazor, 2009* The twentieth season of the 'Selz Founda tion Hazor Excavations in Memory of Yigael Yadin' took place between 21 June and 31 July, 2009. The excavations are sponsored by the Philip and Muriel Berman Center for Biblical Archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and by the Israel Exploration Society. The ex pedition benefitted from the assistance of the Antiqua Foundation (Geneva, Swit zerland), the Edith and Reuben Hecht Fund, the Late Reginald David Benjamin and Esme Benjamin of Perth, Western Australia, and other individual donors. The excavations are conducted in the Hazor National Park and receive full co operation from the National Parks Author ity. The expedition numbered some 40 par ticipants, from the U.S., Canada, Europe and Israel. The excavation of Area M was directed by S. Zuckerman, assisted by S. Bechar. The team also included: D. Porotzki and S. Pirski (surveying and drafting); A. Pattshuro (surveying of Areas A-2 and A-6); M. Cimadevilla (photography); O. Harosch (registration); O. Cohen, assisted by I. Strand (restora tion and preservation); S. Yadid and I. Strand (administration). The expedition was housed at Kibbutz Kfar Ha-Nassi. The Excavations The main area investigated this year was Area M, with small-scale excavations and restoration work carried out in Area A-2. Restoration work was also conducted in Area A-6. Area M Work in this area continued in the same squares that were excavated in 2008. The goals of this season were to complete the excavation of the domestic structures dated to the eighth century BC and conse quently, to begin to uncover the earlier Iron Age remains, the existence of which is marked by the limestone pillars found throughout the area in secondary use. The remains uncovered this year be long mostly to the middle and early phases of the eighth-century BCE settlement (fig. Y so * Cf. IEJ5S (2008): 230-234. 204</page><page sequence="2">NOTES AND NEWS 205 Fig. 1. Area M: The rows of pillars and the later walls reusing them 1). All the structures are domestic in na ture. They are characterised by relatively thin walls, usually less than 50 cm. in width, built of small fieldstones. Several installations, tabum and basalt grinding utensils were found in the various units. The plan of the area is similar to that of later phases, including several domestic structures and small alleys separating them. At least one more phase of these small structures was defined this year. The earliest phase of this eighth-cen tury domestic quarter uncovered thus far is different than its succeeding phases. During this phase the area consists of three or four large domestic structures, each with one or more tabum in its corner. The structures of this early phase are well built, with walls reaching over 60 cm. in width. The main feature forming the cen tre of all later phases in the area, namely, the round bell-shaped stone-lined pit, does not exist in this phase, and the whole area is built up. This phase marks the initial phase of a long process of development, noticed already by the Yadin expedition. The eighth century witnessed a gradual process of decline in the quality and inter nal arrangements of domestic structures throughout the city. Houses of the later part of the eighth century tend to be smaller and closer to one another, and for mer public areas are rebuilt and make room for domestic units and residences. This sequence of overall gradual decline precedes the final destruction of the site in 732 BCE. This season we also carried out a small project, in an effort to identify processes that a house in an urban site undergoes be fore, during and after its abandonment. For this purpose, we divided one room</page><page sequence="3">206 NOTES AND NEWS into 17 squares of 1 1 m., each subdivided into four sub-squares and excavated 5-10 cm. at a time. All the dirt from these sub squares was either wet sieved, dry sieved or sent to flotation. A rich and diverse as semblage of mammal and fish bones, as well as shells and flint artefacts, was iden tified. One wide wall, built with a mudbrick superstructure on a stone foundation, was uncovered in the final week of this season. This wall, 1 m. wide and 15 m. long, ori ented east-west, is the first of its kind in the area. It must have belonged to a large public structure. The two central rows of worked limestone pillars are parallel to this wall, and most probably form the in ner partition walls of an administrative structure. This assumption will be further checked in the next season. The main finds attributed to the Iron Age phases in the area are pottery sherds and some complete and restorable vessels. In addition, several scarabs and seals, three Egyptianised beads made of faience, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic clay figurines, iron and bronze objects and an incised bone lid were found. Area A-2 This area is located between the northern and southern temples, as well as to the west of the latter between it and the courtyard of the Canaanite ceremonial palace. The area between the two temples was partially excavated in the 1950s by Yadin's expedition, which removed the upper layers, dated to the Iron Age. This year, the area between the two temples was excavated down to the paved street dated to the Late Bronze Age I. It tran spires that, in contrast to what we had pre viously concluded, the nicely-cut ashlar stones placed on top of the northern and western walls of the southern palace be long not to the original phase of the build ing, but to a later phase: the temple went out of use sometime in the fifteenth cen tury BCE, but its walls, which were pre served to a considerable height, served as foundations for the walls of a later build ing (a temple?), of which only the founda tions and floor survived. The ashlar stones were placed on the walls of the building only in the Late Bronze Age II (the four teenth century BCE), when the entire area was reorganised and the ceremonial pal ace constructed. At the same time, the raised platform located in the centre of the palace's courtyard was erected, partially built of the same kind of ashlar stones. A channel, draining the large courtyard east of the ceremonial palace, was exca vated in three phases. Its eastern end, cleared by Yadin's expedition,1 led the run-off water into a subterranean reservoir (L.357), also cleared during the 1950s. The western part of that channel was cleared by the renewed excavations in the 1990s.2 Finally, the northern part of the same channel, which encircles the western and northern walls of the southern temple, was cleared by us during the 2009 season (fig- 2). The channel is higher that the level of the paved street located between the two temples. Thus, the dating of this channel to the fourteenth century, suggested by Yadin's expedition in the 1950s, is con firmed. Restoration and Conservation The main restoration effort this season fo cused on the southern temple in Area A-6. The north-eastern corner of this building was already excavated by Yadin's expedi tion in the 1950s, while most of the build ing was cleared by the renewed excava 1 Hazorlll-lV: 18-21. 2 /E/48 (1998): 90.</page><page sequence="4">NOTES AND NEWS 207</page><page sequence="5">208 NOTES AND NEWS tions during the 1990s.3 Already in the 1950s it had become clear that the western and southern parts of the building were in a much better state of preservation than the eastern part, especially its north-east ern corner, which was preserved to a level lower than the pebble floor of the build ing. As a result of the winter rains, parts of the floor in that corner were washed away every year. This year, the walls in the north-eastern corner were restored to a level slightly higher than the floor of the building. Consolidation work was carried out in the favissa located in the centre of the temple and in a test pit located next to the southern wall of the building cut by us in previous years in order to determine the history of the building. Parts of the eastern fa ade of the palace which were leaning out in a dangerous angle were dismantled and rebuilt (fig. 3). Consolidation work was carried out in the two complexes of masseboth in Areas A-l and A-4. PFFFRFNCFS Hazor III-IV Ben-Tor, A. (ed.), Razor III-IV.

IEJ 58 (2008): 234-236. * The Excavations The work this season focused on the main rooms and spaces uncovered in 2008. The layout of the area during the last phases of the Late Bronze Age can now be recon structed (fig. 1). The area is arranged around an open space, with one row of rooms opening onto it from the west. These rooms should probably be inter preted as storage spaces or shops, as sug gested by the fact that at least four addi tional pithoi were found in the central room, complementing the three uncovered last season. Two bronze scale pans, a lead weight and several stone weights support this interpretation. A notable feature in the central court yard is an accumulation of small and me dium-sized stones, arranged in a roughly rounded form. This accumulation was al ready noted last year, and it appears that the upper layers spread over a larger area than the lower ones. While its original function is unknown, this accumulation</page><page sequence="6">NOTES AND NEWS 209 Fig. 1. Area S at the end of the season (top of photo ? south) might represent a pit or some other kind of installation. A possible drainage channel leads to it from the west. The southern room, the eastern part of which was excavated in 2008, was exca vated meticulously this season. The west ern part of the room was divided into ten 1 1 m. squares, each sub-divided into four and excavated 5-*10 cm. at a time. All the dirt from these sub-squares was either wet-sieved, dry-sieved, or sent to flota tion. A rich and diverse assemblage of mammal and fish bones, as well as shells and flint artefacts, was identified. The re sults of this excavation will be compared to the excavation of other floors of this phase, in an effort to gain more data con cerning the formation and abandonment processes of the area in its final phases of existence. Sharon Zuckerman TelZahara, 2009* The fourth season at Tel Zahara (grid ref. 1929 2131), a small settlement site lo cated c. 5 km. west of Beth Shean, took place between 31 May and 26 June, 2009. The excavations were conducted on be half of Montana State University, in asso ciation with the Israel Antiquities Author ity, and affiliated with the American Insti tute for Archaeological Research and the Council for British Research in the Lev ant, were directed by S.L.

Staff accommodation was provided by Kibbutz Nir David. The Excavations The 2009 excavation season at Tel Zahara was designed to continue excavating the area above where stratified Middle Bronze Age remains are known to be lo cated, with the goal of opening a broad ex posure in this area to enable successful ex cavation of those lower occupational lev els in future seasons. To do so, four new squares were opened (NE.A.6, SE.B.6, SE.A.8 and SE.B.8) and excavation con tinued in squares that had been opened in previous seasons (NE.A.8, NE.A.7, SE.A.?and SE.B.7) (fig. 1). The specific goals of the season, there fore, consisted of: 1) opening new squares to expand the targeted excavation area; 2) uncovering the Roman strata in these new areas and connecting them with the Ro man strata excavated in previous seasons; 3) removing all remains of the Roman ar chitecture and associated drainage system throughout the entire area (Strata IIA and IIB); and 4) removing the large Roman levelling fills (Stratum IIC) throughout the area in order to expose the Hellenistic stratum (Stratum III) below. Overall, the season was successful in meeting all of these goals. The Roman strata have been removed from all open squares (with the exception of the cistern; see below), and excavation in 2010 will be able to concentrate on the next occupa tional phase at the site. The overall strata for Tel Zahara have been established since the conclusion of the 2008 season, and are listed below: Tel Zahara \ jr?p?wcl By d. Rosenberg Fig. 1. Map of Tel Zahara, with excavation areas indicated (prepared by J. Rosenberg)</page><page sequence="8">NOTES AND NEWS 211 Stratum I: Islamic and mixed (fills/ pits, with no architecture; the ceramic range is Early Bronze through Ay yubid); Stratum IIA: Roman (second building phase; rebuild and additions to the origi nal buildings); Stratum IIB: Roman (first building phase; original construction); Stratum IIC: Roman (pre-building; levelling fills for the construction);1 Stratum III: Hellenistic; Stratum IV: Persian/Iron III; Stratum V: Middle Bronze; Stratum VI: Early Bronze. Strata VI-IV No new remains dating from these strata were uncovered during the 2009 season. Stratum III: The Hellenistic Remains Stratum III remains were uncovered and/or excavated in all squares except SE.A.6. The primary Hellenistic occupa tion consists of a large structure located in the eastern half of the open excavation area. One long wall runs SW-NE through the entire grid; an EW cross wall connects with this SW-NE wall towards its north ern extent. The western part of the long SW-NE wall appears to be outside this building. On the east, however, the EW cross wall divides the building into two occupational areas. In the north, below the Roman lev elling fills, a patchy plastered surface was uncovered. The southern portion of this surface had patches of bright orange, black and grey burnt patches in it. As this did not continue throughout the entire area, it is unlikely it indicates a destruc tion; rather, these isolated patches may be indications of various activity areas. Cob bled patches were uncovered in several ar eas within this room. An ashy fill over both the plaster and cobbles again suggest either local destruction, or that there were working areas within this room. In the north, the plaster was cut by the later Ro man building activities; it is possible that whatever closing wall may have existed in the north was also destroyed as well. To the south of the EW cross wall, a small one-course-wide stone wall ran perpen dicular to it at its western extent and patches of cobblestones were also uncov ered. Stratum II: The Roman Remains Most of the material excavated at Tel Zahara in 2009 dates from the Roman period.2 Excavation uncovered further remains of the large Roman building located on the upper portion of the slope of the site excavated in previous seasons. In addition, further components of the drain age system associated with this building were uncovered. Stratum IIC. ? This stratum, consisting of the large levelling fills placed prior to the construction of the buildings in Stratum IIB, has no architectural components. Large fills throughout the excavation area appear to have been deliberately laid in order to prepare for and accommodate the large building activities in Stratum IIB. 1 The division of Stratum II into three sub strata is based purely on architectural con siderations. The ceramic typology does not indicate any significant chronological differences between phases. 2 A more precise dating for the Roman oc cupation at Tel Zahara has been estab lished since the 2008 season. The chrono logical range of the occupation dates be tween 70 CE and the second half of the second century CE.</page><page sequence="9">212 NOTES AND NEWS These fills were uniformly marked by large quantities of Roman pottery, as well as by earlier sherds, and were character ised by the tip lines that marked their deliberate placement, which often resulted in a 'striped' appearance in the ground. Stratum IIB. ? No major Stratum IIB ele ments were excavated this season. Stratum IIA. ? Most of the architecture excavated in 2009 belongs to the Stratum IIA rebuild phase of the Roman occupa tion. A new Stratum IIA room was exca vated in the north-west of the area, adding to the building on the upper slope, previ ously excavated in 2007 and 2008. Inside this room there was a cobble stone paving. A large square stone with a hole in its cen tre and grooving ? possibly a drain cover in secondary use ? was laid in the centre of this cobbled surface (fig. 2). Part of the surface was cut on its western extent by a later robber trench. Additional cobble sur faces ? one with a tabun constructed above it ? were discovered to the south east of this room and outside the room on its southern side. The Roman Drainage System The initial drainage system in Stratum IIB consists of the bell-shaped, plaster-lined cistern and one channel (excavated in 2006). With the architectural additions made to the building in Stratum IIA, sev eral new channels were added (all exca vated in previous seasons). In 2009, addi tional elements of two of the Stratum IIA channels were excavated, in squares SE.A.8 and SE.B.6 (fig. 3). In both cases, the channels consisted of a thick plaster Fig. 2.

Stratum IIA drainage channel in square SE.B.6 (view to the south; photo by S. Cohen) U-shaped trough, and both were plastered directly to the sides of Stratum IIA walls. Conclusions The 2009 season at Tel Zahara uncovered further Roman period architectural remains, further delineating the character of the Roman occupation at the site. The buildings are of solid construction, and the series of drainage channels point to a care fully planned period of occupation. The ceramic remains, along with the coins, indicate that the Roman occupation at Tel Zahara dates between 70 CE and the sec ond half of the second century CE. All evi dence continues to support the hypothesis that the site functioned as a small estate during this period, most probably con nected with the larger Roman city at Beth Shean (Scythopolis). The Roman material is currently being prepared for publica tion, with an anticipated publication date in late 2010. The Hellenistic occupation at Tel Zahara consists of one large building in the eastern half of the area, with a small portion of another large structure in the north-western corner of the area. The ce ramic remains provide a tentative date of second-third centuries BCE, although this remains to be examined more fully. Next summer's excavations will focus on exca vating this Stratum III occupation at the site, recording and removing it, in order to reach the earlier occupational strata be low. Susan L.

The expedition included students from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Southern Adventist University (Chatta nooga TN), Virginia Commonwealth Uni versity (Richmond VA) and Oakland Uni versity (Rochester MI), as well as volun teers. It was lodged at the Ramot Shapira hostel. Funds were kindly provided by J.B. Silver, Benjamin Eisin, Foundation Stone, the Institute of Archaeology of Southern Adventist University and the In stitute of Archaeology of the Hebrew Uni versity of Jerusalem. The Excavations Four areas of the site were examined: Areas A, B, C and D (figs. 1-2). Area A This area is located in the centre of the site, at its summit. Even before excava tion, a large rectangular complex was visi ble. In the 2009 season, a large part of the west wing and a probing square in the east wing of the complex were excavated, revealing a fortress (Castellum). The square structure (c. 35x35 m.) was well preserved, with one of its walls exceeding 2 m. in height. The fortress consists of casemate rooms surrounding a courtyard, in which a bell-shaped water cistern and three hewn drainage channels were found. The walls were constructed of large ashlar stones, laid directly upon bedrock. The stratified material culture, mainly pottery</page><page sequence="13">216 NOTES AND NEWS and a relatively rich numismatic assem blage, point to a construction date of c. fourth century CE, with occupation up to the sixth century. Noteworthy is a com plete Late Roman glass jug found embed ded in one of the fortress walls; it clearly served as a foundation deposit. There are no towers, and theoretically, the structure could be caravanserai. How ever, its strategic location, size and solid construction, and parallels that are demon strably military, suggest that it had a mili tary function. In any case, it could have served a dual purpose as caravanserai and fortress. It was apparently part of the security system of the Eleutherpolis Aelia Capitolina road, overlooking the junction with the branch leading towards Ashkelon. It appears to correspond well to the clusters of fortresses reported from southern Samaria and the Hebron mountains from the fourth-sixth centuries CE. Interestingly, no Hellenistic remains were found in this area. A rich pottery as semblage of the Iron Age IIA was uncov ered below the Late Roman floor, directly upon bedrock. Noteworthy are the re mains of an apparently small Ottoman farm, which damaged the south-west cor ner of the Late Roman complex. A well preserved plaster kiln was excavated in the western wing of the fortress, and it seems that a similar one is located in the eastern wing as well. These large kilns may have served the inhabitants of the nearby village of Beit Nattif or Zakariyeh during the last centuries. Area This area, already excavated in the 2007 and 2008 seasons, is located in the western Fig. 3. General view of Area (the gate and north) and Area D (south of the gate)</page><page sequence="14">NOTES AND NEWS 217 Fig. 4. Area : Iron IIA gate after reconstruction part of the site (fig. 3). Two layers were found here: the lower one an Iron Age IIA city built on bedrock, including a massive four-chambered gate, a casemate city wall and houses, and the upper one Hellenistic, which in some places was built on top of the Iron IIA remains and in some places cut into them. By the end of the 2008 season, all the walls in the gate area ? Hellenistic and Iron IIA alike ? were left intact. In April 2009, the Hellenistic walls in the gate area were excavated and a Hellenistic gate was found, with a threshold constructed from three large flat stones. Below, an Iron IIA gate has been completely unearthed (fig. 4). In the 2009 season, Area was ex panded to the north, and by the end of the season, three Iron IIA houses had been completely uncovered. Each house abuts one casemate, a city plan well known in four other Iron II urban centres in Judah: Beth Shemesh, Tell Beit Mirsim, Tell en Nasbeh, and Tell Beersheba. Two drainage systems were found in the gate of Area B. The southern one is higher and relates to the threshold of the Hellenistic gate. It was found open, with a lot of Hellenistic pottery. Most of this fill was excavated in 2008, and the excavation was completed in 2009. The drain in the northern side of the gate is lower, and was still covered with the original capstones, found below Iron IIA sediment. In 2009, we opened approximately 1 metre of the drain and excavated it to bedrock, wet sift ing all the sediment, and microfauna bones were carefully collected. All the pottery from the drain is typical Iron Age</page><page sequence="15">218 NOTES AND NEWS IIA pottery. Carbonised olive pits were found as well, and were sent for radiomet rie dating. In the northern part of Area B, massive Hellenistic building activity was noticed. This later activity destroyed most of the Iron IIA building that once stood here ? the fourth building north of the gate. Area C This area is located in the south-east cor ner of the site, adjacent to the DElah Valley (fig. 5). As in Area B, two occupation lay ers were noted. An Iron Age IIA fortified city, with a four-chambered gate and a casemate city wall, was built on bedrock. Over this occupation, extensive Hellenis tic building activities had taken place. The Iron IIA gate was completely blocked in the Hellenistic period. Large, multiple room buildings were constructed over the gate, causing much damage to it. In the gate passageway, a drain was cut into bed rock; some parts of it were still covered with the original capstones. The sediment from this drain includes only Iron IIA pot tery. Olive pits collected from the drain were sent for radiometrie dating. Four casemates were excavated ? two west of the gate and two east of it. East of the gate the Iron IIA layer was well pre served, and parts of two houses were exca vated. Like in Area B, each house abuts one city-wall casemate. The floors of the houses were found with rich concentra tions of broken pottery vessels and stone tools, indicating sudden destruction. Two outstanding items were found in Area C. One is a pottery fragment of a model of a house, including architectural features and a palm tree. The other is a small glass seal depicting a lion and a standing figure. AreaD This area extends to the south of the Area gate following the casemate wall. Two casemates were excavated (fig. 3). Below topsoil they contained stone debris, heavily mixed with Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine pottery. Several coins dat ing from the Roman period were found in the fill. A thin, burnt layer was evident immediately below this fill. Below the burnt layer, and at approximately the same level as the top of the large Iron IIA case mate walls, a floor adjacent to the case mate extending to the east was dated to the Hellenistic period. A silver tetradrachm of Alexander the Great was found on it. Below the surface, another fill was exca vated, containing only Hellenistic pottery. Below this, an Iron IIA floor was reached, covering the entire interior of the case mates and the thresholds. Several restor able storage jars with thumb prints, a lamp, a chalice and other vessels were found on the floors inside, only a few centimetres above bedrock. The pottery is exclusively Iron Age IIA. The outer casemates and their fills were separated toward the east by a paral lel wall running south-north and into the baulk. A massive fill of small cobbles and earth was excavated. Below it, a Hellenis tic floor, containing a well-preserved tabun, was reached. Excavation in Area D ended before the two eastern squares were completed to bedrock. A survey team employed new Topcon GPS and Total Station equipment with ArchGIS software to provide daily top plans of each square and to experiment with three-dimensional reconstruction plans of each occupational phase. This work will continue in future seasons. Conclusions In each of the four excavation areas, com plete Iron IIA vessels were found on floors.

The site functioned as a rich urban centre. One would expect mention of a town of such importance in the biblical records; indeed, we suggest its identification with Shacarayim, mentioned twice in asso ciation with the late eleventh century BCE (1 Sam. 17:52, 1 Chron. 4:31-32) (Garfmkel and Ganor 2008). The Iron IIA city came to a sudden end. Its location on the border between Judah and the Philistine kingdom of Gath sug gests that it might have been destroyed during one of the many military clashes that took place in this area. The site was in use for a short time in the Late Persian-Early Hellenistic period, during which it was a fortified centre. The large number of metal objects and coins indicates a rich population. No restorable vessels were found in this layer, indicating that it was abandoned peacefully. During the late Roman period (fourth sixth centuries CE), the site was occupied again and a massive complex built on its summit. During its three phases of use, the site seems to have had a great military im portance. This is due to its strategic loca tion on the northern side of the 5Elah Val ley, on the main road from the Coastal Plain to Jerusalem.

Burke (Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, University of California, Los Angeles) and M. Peilst?cker (IAA). The excavations were supervised by K. Keimer and G. Pierce (UCLA graduate students); the work was carried out by UCLA undergraduates. Soundings were conducted within the visitors' centre and outside it, between the visitors' centre and Mifratz Shlomo Street to the east. The former were intended to clarify the stratigraphy related to Jacob Kaplan's excavations in Area C and to ex amine the possibility of reaching Bronze and Iron Age stratigraphie remains by means of probes within the previously ex cavated area. The excavations outside were conducted in cooperation with the IAA's request to provide oversight for ef forts by the Old Jaffa Development Com pany to reclaim space on this part of the tel without disturbing archaeological de posits. Area C was so designated by Jacob Kaplan during his 1961 and 1965 excava tions.1 Also retained were Kaplan's square designations, which could be easily identi fied on his unpublished plans.2 Since 1 Kaplan 1962: 149-150; 1966: 282- 283. 2 We would like to thank Orit Tsuf (Univer sity of Haifa), who is publishing the re</page><page sequence="18">NOTES AND NEWS 221 1965, salvage excavations in this area had been conducted by the IAA from July to September 1992, prior to the enclosure of the archaeological remains under a roof, which required the construction of a frame around the entire area so that the structure could be built (Brand 1994). This enclo sure now functions as a tourist visitors' centre, operated by the Old Jaffa Develop ment Company.3 Excavations within the Visitors ' Centre As excavation planning proceeded for the visitors' centre excavations, the identifica tion of references to specific features within Kaplan's preliminary reports led to the conclusion that a deep probe for early materials would not be fruitful in the low est area previously exposed and probed by Kaplan. Kaplan, in fact, indicated that his soundings yielded three phases of pre third-century BCE remains in this area (1962: 149). While he did not specify to what phases these remains belonged, the realisation that his sounding had been situ ated exactly where we had intended to place our own meant that a new strategy was necessary. Four probes were excavated within the lines of the conspicuous ashlar masonry dated by Kaplan to the early Hellenistic period (fig. 1), which can be traced across the entire excavation area today. Although the probes were excavated with primary reference to these wall remains, they can mains from Kaplan's excavations in Area C, for providing us with Kaplan's plans and her insights on these excavations. Tsuf also provided preliminary readings of the classical ceramics recovered during the excavations. 3 The Old Jaffa Development Company provided permission to excavate within the visitors' centre, for which we are very grateful. also be localised within Kaplan's excava tion squares: probe 1 within squares CC101 and DD 101, probes 2 and 3 within square DD101, and probe 4 spanning squares CCI00, CC101 and DD 101 (figs. 2-3). Probe 1. ? This probe was opened on a north-west to south-east orientation along the elevation of the northern ashlar wall (L.1005), which disappeared on the west into the layers of earth, and across a stepped stone feature (L. 1000/1007) that abutted the southern elevation of Wall 1005. Thus, at the outset of our excava tions there was no evidence for the west ern end of Wall 1005. Very quickly, how ever, the upper course of L. 1006, the outer face of an ashlar wall, was identified to the west (fig. 4). Eventually, this wall was completely exposed and remained stand ing to nine courses, while Wall 1005 stood even higher at 12 courses (fig. 1). These two walls appear to constitute the western and northern limits of both a first-storey room and a second-storey room above the level of the doorway at the eastern end of Wall 1005, which Kaplan had already exposed in 1961 as part of the so-called cellar or catacomb (Kaplan 1962: 149). None of the excavation records suggest that Kaplan was aware of the limits of this room; on the contrary, he left the western half of the room unexcavated. Our excava tions revealed the remains of the plaster floor that had probably covered this entire space (L.1025) at the level of the floor (approximately 19.20 m. ASL; fig. 3). Our excavations also enabled us to identify the enigmatic stepped stone struc ture (L. 1000/1007) that cut across the cen tre of this space (figs. 1, 3). This feature turned out to be nothing more than a mod ern mantle of stones (as revealed by mod ern debris just underneath these stones), probably dating from the 1970s, which</page><page sequence="19">222 NOTES AND NEWS Fig. 1. 2008 visitors' centre excavations, showing Kaplan's excavation grid (drawn by G.A. Pierce) was intended to prevent further erosion of the lower courses of an early Roman wall, laid across this room from its southern wall to its northern one, 60 cm. to the east of and parallel to L.1006. Although Kaplan exposed the early Roman wall in his 1961 excavations as the western limit of the 'cellar', he apparently did not exca vate any of the Early Roman fill deposited on its western side (L.1004, 1008, 1012), which we excavated following the re moval of the modern stepped stone struc ture. The last 50 cm. (L.1012) of this 2.18 m. deep Early Roman fill included a large quantity of dressed ashlars that had collapsed from the southern extension of Wall 1006, which is distinctly broken away from top to bottom (fig. 5). In addi tion to Hellenistic and Early Roman pot tery, the Early Roman fill produced two nearly complete lamps and a bronze bracelet (?). The excavation of probe 1 revealed the full dimensions of the central room, which</page><page sequence="20">NOTES AND NEWS 223 Fig. 2.

Probe 1 at end of excavation; note discolouration of Wall 1005, showing location of debris below L. 1000/1007 (view to the north) was constructed of ashlar headers and stretchers ? 3.40 m. along each side, with a height of c. 2.5 m. As evident along the north, east, and south elevations, already exposed by Kaplan, ledges ran along the ceiling of the first storey to the north and east, and the wooden beams of the second storey floor rested on them (fig. 1). At the base of Wall 1005, a wall of undressed stones (L.1024) was exposed, on a similar but not identical line, suggesting an earlier phase of construction. Based on the ma sonry of Wall 1024 and its comparison with the Persian masonry exposed by Kaplan in Area A, coupled with the fact that it is earlier in date than Wall 1005, this sub-floor feature is tentatively assigned to the Persian period, making it the earliest feature known in Area C. Other Probes. ? Three smaller probes were excavated in an effort to clarify stratigraphie relationships with the Helle nistic ashlar masonry building (fig. 3). Probe 2, to the north of Wall 1005, was undertaken to identify the northern face of this wall (fig. 4). It was unsuccessful, because the northern face of Wall 1005, like the western face of Wall 1006, appears to have been robbed out, col lapsed, or both. As a result, this probe was stopped shortly after it was begun. Probe 3 was undertaken to identify the west face of Wall 1006. After the exposure of two courses of the eastern elevation of L.1006, it became evident that some thing had caused the wall to buckle. Only later, during the excavation of probe 1, did it become apparent that the entire southern Fig. 5. Probe 1 showing collapsed ashlar blocks and line of break in Wall 1006; probe 3 located behind Wall 1006 (view to the west)</page><page sequence="22">NOTES AND NEWS 225</page><page sequence="23">226 NOTES AND NEWS extent of Wall 1006 had collapsed and/or been removed, from its upper courses to the level of the floor (fig. 5). The probe was also instrumental in our attempts to relate the Roman period wall at the west end of the probe to the earlier Hellenistic (?) wall (L.1006). Poorly preserved traces of a plaster floor were detected in the probe, the sub-floor fill of which (L.1010) included a fragment of an early Roman period Judaean limestone cup; no occupa tional debris, however, was encountered on the floor. Nothing else of note was en countered, and the probe was abandoned ? in order to avoid undermining Wall 1006 ? before its northern face had been identified. After the completion of probes 2 and 3 and as we were nearing the completion of probe 1, probe 4 was opened to the north of Wall 1005. Its purpose was to determine if the room to the north of Wall 1005, which was accessed through the doorway at the eastern end of Wall 1005 (fig. 1), possessed a ceiling that would need to be removed before the continuation of exca vations in 2009. Excavation revealed that no ceiling (or floor of the second storey) remained intact in this space, although a substantial amount of debris of ashlar ma sonry filled it (L. 1013; fig. 6). The probe was discontinued after excavations reached the lower edge of the stone lintel on the inside of the doorway (on the north side of Wall 1005). As seen in fig. 6, the condition of this lintel necessitated its re placement after Kaplan's excavations; un fortunately, narrow wood beams were used during earlier conservation efforts (fig. 1), which may need to be replaced be fore substantial work here can continue. Although very little pottery was recovered from this locus to permit a confident dat ing of the fill, it appears that this fill, as on the south side of Wall 1005, dates from the Early Roman period. It is uncertain how this room functioned, but it is possible that this narrow space led from the doorway north and up a set of stairs to the second storey. Fig. 6. Probe 4 to the north of Wall 1005 (view to the south-west)</page><page sequence="24">NOTES AND NEWS 227 The excavations of the 2008 season were quite successful in determining the nature and extent of the so-called third-century BCE remains that Kaplan first exposed in 1961, but which largely remain below the surface level across Area C within the vis itors' centre. As excavations proceed within the central room in which probe 1 was excavated, and within the rooms to the west of Wall 1006 and north of Wall 1005, there is tremendous potential for exposing in situ early Hellenistic remains, which Kaplan was not able to reach in this area due to the limited duration of his excavations. The character of the architec ture of the Hellenistic building (which compares well with early Hellenistic architecture at Tel Dor) and the fact that the building appears to have been filled in a single operation during the early Roman period seem to tentatively support Kaplan's proposed third-century BCE date for this structure. Nevertheless, fur ther excavation will be necessary to iden tify the nature of this structure, the func tion of its various rooms, and the precise date of its construction, use and subse quent modification, already preliminarily documented by Kaplan. Excavations East of the Visitors ' Centre In addition to the probes within the visi tors' centre, another one was opened on the east side of Qedumim Square. Although only two days of exploration were possible before the end of the exca vation season, it quickly became evident that architectural remains were present immediately below the modern paving, thus confirming Kaplan's observations regarding both Areas C and X. On the basis of Kaplan's stratigraphie sequence for Area C (see Kaplan 1962) and the rela tive levels of architecture detected within the visitors' centre, a date in the early Islamic period is likely. Unfortunately, due to the limited time available for this probe, very few ceramics were recovered; consequently, a more precise dating is not yet possible. Our findings demonstrated, however, that reclamation efforts for this portion of the site are not possible without disturbing archaeological deposits.

The Excavations (fig. 1 ) The khan building includes three wings surrounding an inner court from the south, east and north. The western wing, which appears in aerial photography of the khan from 1936, was demolished during the 1950s. Excavations were carried out in two ar eas: area C, the inner court, where we hoped to find architectural remains of ear lier structures, buried below the court, and area D, inside the northern hall, where we hoped to gain information that would help us date the initial construction of the khan. Area C: The Inner Courtyard In 2007, we found that the court was cov ered with up to 2 m. of modern refuse. The season was followed by an extensive oper ation to clear the trash and expose the orig inal floor level, using heavy machinery. We uncovered small segments of the clos ing western wall. Our goal in the 2008 season was to ex Fig. 1. Khan: plan</page><page sequence="26">NOTES AND NEWS 229 amine if there were any earlier courtyard surfaces or occupation levels below these surfaces. We also wanted to recover larger segments of the western wing and investi gate its relation to the wings of the khan. A line of four excavation squares was marked out along an east-west axis at the centre of the courtyard. The floor of the courtyard, found in all four squares, is made of packed earth, re futing our earlier assumption that the court was paved. Unfortunately, we uncovered no finds on the floor dating from the time of its use. We found only one floor dating from the nineteenth-twentieth centuries for the courtyard, in contrast to the se quence of floors found inside the northern hall, dating from the seventeenth-twenti eth centuries. A large segment of the western enclos ing wall was revealed (fig. 2). An inspec tion of the physical connection of the en closing wall to the southern wing (fig. 3) revealed that the construction of the wall was earlier. Architectural features found to the west of the wall are of structures lo cated outside or as part of the western wing of the khan. Two earlier layers were found below the court surface. The first is a stone-built installation sunk into the ground (fig. 2). It is difficult to determine its purpose. We plan to examine the relationship between the installation and the built wings of the khan. Below the installations we found a thick layer of earth debris mixed with pot tery and animal bones. From the colour of the earth, it looks as if it was fired. Two complete jugs were found resting in the debris. In the coming season, we plan to investigate whether there is a destruction layer below the courtyard. The Northern Hall (Area D) The northern hall is large (7.5x24.0 m.),</page><page sequence="27">230 NOTES AND NEWS Fig. 3. The western enclosing wall and the walls of the southern wing built against it roofed with cross-vaults and reinforced by supporting pilasters on the outside. Two stone benches were found along the north ern and southern walls of the hall (fig. 4). One entrance was in the middle of the southern wall, connecting the hall with the inner court. A second entrance might have existed in the northern wall, parallel to the southern entrance, but this is impossible to verify because the wall was breached at this point. A shaft-like window is located in the eastern wall. This uniquely-shaped window must have served for other pur poses ? perhaps as part of a manufactur ing installation for some as yet unknown product ? besides the need for light and fresh air. In 2007, we conducted a small trial dig next to the southern opening. We then ex posed the door's threshold and founda tion. Dateable material, mainly pottery sherds found in the earth fill next to the en trance, suggested that the hall had been built during the eighteenth century ? a surprising result, as our assumption was that this wing was Mamluk. This season, in order to test these re sults, we decided to open another trial pit (2.0x2.5 m.), in the south-eastern corner of the hall, just below the shaft-shaped window. The finds brought to light by the trial dig are instructive for an understand ing of the hall's use over the past three centuries. A sequence of five living surfaces was found, one on top of the other (fig. 5). All the floors abutted the southern wall of the hall ? clear proof that they are contempo rary with the wall. The floors are made of hard packed earth. Most bore only broken pieces of pottery and many animal bones. The large number of floors found one on top of the other testifies to the hall's long period of use, in the course of which floors were repaired and raised. On the earliest floor we also found ash</page><page sequence="28">Fig. 4. The northern hall before excavations (view to the east) Fig. 5. The excavated square inside the northern hall, at the end of the excavation season</page><page sequence="29">232 NOTES AND NEWS and other signs of fire and heat. This sug gests a local destruction, but larger expo sure is necessary to reach definite conclu sions. An examination of the material from the floors reveals that it all dates from the seventeenth-nineteenth centuries CE. The results verify our 2007 conclusions: that the northern hall of the khan was built in the eighteenth century CE at the earliest. It is noteworthy that the stone bench built against the southern wall of the hall covered the earlier floors, with only the last floor abutting it. Clearly, this bench was added at a very late stage during the twentieth century. Yuval Gadot and Taufik Deadle OBITUARIES Elisha Linder, the founder of the research and education in marine archaeology in Israel, passed away peacefully in his kib butz, Macagan Mikhael, on June 7, 2009, at the age of 85. Even during his graduate studies, Elisha Linder developed a profound inter est in maritime archaeology, which led him to establish, in 1961, the Undersea Exploration Society of Israel. With that society, he initiated archaeological sur veys of ancient maritime sites in Israel, such as Achziv, Akko, Athlit, Dor, Caesarea, Jaffa and Ashkelon along the Mediterranean coast, as well as Gezirath Faracun and several other shipwreck sites in the Red Sea and in the Sea of Gali lee. He was the founder and editor of the Journal of the Underwater Exploration Society. In 1971, after receiving his Ph.D. from Brandeis University in 1970, he joined the academic staff of the University of Haifa, founded the Department of the History of Maritime Civilizations, and concurrently ? with generous donations and the active support of Jacob Recanati ? he founded the Leon Recanati Center for Maritime Studies. Early in his academic activity, Elisha Linder realised that the research and in vestigations of evidence for maritime ma terial culture should be multidisciplinary, and that experts in maritime archaeology and maritime history should cooperate closely with marine geologists, marine bi ologists and physical oceanographers to retrieve reliable information from the sea floor. Consequently, he developed the aca demic curriculum of maritime civiliza tions to be multidisciplinary and interdis ciplinary and he recruited for the Depart ment of Maritime Civilizations not only archaeologists and historians, but also bi ologists and geologists. These scholars co operated closely in their teaching, in their tuition of graduate students, and in their active research. Furthermore, Elisha Linder insisted that all theses written in the department should be multidis ciplinary, requiring at least two advisors in complementary fields of expertise. In this composite approach, he preceded his gen eration in his vision of the development of these fields of science. Elisha Linder was deeply interested in the Phoenician, Hellenistic and contempo raneous shipping enterprises, and led in depth investigations of two outstanding finds in this field. The first was the 1980 discovery of a battering ram off Athlit, at tributed to a Hellenistic galley that has not yet been discovered. Large rams were known from ancient paintings to be mounted on the bows of the warships of the ancient Mediterranean, but the weight of the Athlit ram ? 465 kg. ? and the high quality of the bronze from which it was cast exceeded all expectations. The ram is exhibited at the National Maritime</page><page sequence="30">NOTES AND NEWS 233 Museum in Haifa, and several replicas are exhibited in museums around the world. Later, in 1985, a cargo vessel, dated to c. 400 BCE, was fortuitously discovered at the beach of Macagan Mikhael, some 500 m. from Elisha Linder's own doorstep. During the following 15 years, Elisha guided the scientific salvage of that ship wreck, recording the shape of the vessel and its cargo, excavating it from the sea floor, and conducting its arduous conser vation. Together with Yaacov Kahanov, he co-authored two volumes of The Macagan Mikhael Ship. The Recovery of a 2400 Year-Old Merchantman, Final Report (Jerusalem, 2003 and 2004). He tutored several graduate students using that wreck and led a complex, multidisciplinary ex pedition to explore the multi-faceted as pects of ancient shipping, as well as the preservation of ancient vessels. He also succeeded in arousing the curiosity and in terest of several benefactors, who gener ously supported the enterprise of excavat ing, preserving and presenting the unique ancient vessel. The Macagan Mikhael ship is on display at the Reuben and Edith Hecht Museum in the University of Haifa. Elisha Linder was a pioneer not only in maritime archaeology in Israel, but in his understanding that maritime research must be multidisciplinary, and that experts of the numerous fields of oceanography should combine forces to thoroughly ex plore the ways in which man has been us ing the sea for transport, communication, trade and war. His contribution to mari time archaeology and humanistic ocean ography has been internationally recog nised repeatedly. All those who appreciate the complexity of the scientific research at sea will miss him deeply.</page></plain_text>
