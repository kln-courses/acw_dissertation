<plain_text><page sequence="1">THIS IS WHERE I FOUND HER The Goddess of the Garden Frances Stahl Bernstein Aphrodite of Cyprus is presented to us by Homer, Hesiod, Euripides, and countless other poets as the goddess of Love, the goddess who aided Trojan heroes, and the goddess who offered Helen as a bribe, consequently bringing on the Trojan War. Yet this goddess was herself the product of a patriarchal culture and mythology, a product of a "heroic age." There was another Aphrodite, a Goddess not so well known, who was altogether differ ent and who recalled a much older religious tradition looking back to Paleo lithic and Neolithic times. This other great Goddess represented "a return to the realm of those powers and knowledges which, in the interval, had been waiting unattended, undeveloped, ever unknown, in that 'other mind' which is woman; the mind that in the earlier Aegean day of those lovely beings of Crete had made its sensitive statement, but in the sheerly mascu line Heroic Age had been submerged like an Atlantis."' Unlike the Aphrod ite who was a catalyst for male heroics, the power of this most ancient Goddess was in the direct, seamless, and accessible presence of nature. She dwelt in the realm of the "other mind," that of nature, woman, and the home. This is where I found her, remembered and cherished in the homes of the ancient Pompeians. For the past three years I have gone into the homes in the ancient Roman town of Pompeii, destroyed by Vesuvius in 79 C.E., to examine and identify sacred space, to interpret the wall paintings, and to study the sym bolic language, the iconography. It was not until I had read the works of Marija Gimbutas that I came to understand this other Goddess. With indebt edness and gratitude for Gimbutas's scholarship and groundbreaking work, I share now my exploration of one of the homes, the house of Venus Marina at 2.3.3 and the garden painting on its south wall.2 ' Joseph Campbell, The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology (New York: Penguin, 1976), 160. 2 I am greatly indebted to EarthWatch and to all the volunteers on this project.

These, when they came to the wooded glade on the mountainside, washed their bodies, gleaming white, in water gushing from a spring; then they came to Priam's son, bidding high with spiteful words, the rivals; the Cyprian won with her soft-spoken wiles, a delight for the hearer, but a cruel upheaval for the towers of Troy. -Euripides, Andromeda3 It began with a beauty contest. According to myth, a golden apple was tossed by Eris at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, and on it was written, "to the fairest one." Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite each claimed the prize hence the beauty contest described in the epigraph from Euripides. As the well-known classicist Jane Harrison commented, the contest was "vulgar in itself and complicated by bribery still more vulgar."4 The goddesses immedi ately fell to deceit, offering gifts to Paris, the son of King Priam of Troy and judge of this great event. Athena offered military glory and wisdom, Hera offered power and majesty, and Aphrodite offered Helen and love. In this myth, Paris had to choose among the three deities and the traits each embodied, for Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite had become "departmen tal" goddesses associated with their bribes. Further, these qualities were thank David G. Orr, Betty Jo Mayeske, and Val Woeffel for her artwork. Regarding the house number, Pompeian addresses are given three numbers: the first number indicates the region, the second the block or insula, and the third the individual structure. Thus, 2.3.3 indicates the house of Venus Marina. 3 Euripides, Andromeda 274-92, in Euripides and the Judgement of Paris, trans. T. C. W. Stinton (London: Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies, 1965), 13. It is gener ally accepted that this myth dates to at least 650 B.C.E., when the Judgment of Paris was depicted on an ivory comb from Sparta (see "Artemis Orthia," Journal of Hellenic Studies supp., vol. 5, 223 and pl. 127). The myth, however, is not considered pre-Homeric (for discussion, see Stinton, 3-4). The earliest literary reference is the Cypria ascribed to Stasinus of Cyprus circa mid-seventh century B.C.E.

Who, then, was judge of the most excellent and ideal female? It was a young male shepherd and prince. "In its current form," wrote Jane Harrison in 1903, this myth is "sufficiently patriarchal to please the taste of Olympian Zeus himself...."5 To counter the ideal Homeric hero, the victorious and unbroken male, we see now the fragmented and broken female. In the masculine dream world of this myth, the ideal female and winner of the contest was Aphrodite, known not for her wisdom or her forthright use of power but as the love goddess whose place was "in the marriage bed."6 She was cast into a powerful but limited and vicarious role. When Aphrodite did act on her own in the epics of Homer and Virgil, her role was to aid and abet the masculine will and to urge her Trojans on to greater heroic deeds. In the Judgment of Paris, a prime example of patriarchal mythology, the female is devalued in a symbolic sense that was assuredly reflected in the personal, psychological, and very real human world of ancient Greece. This myth is rooted in a male dream world that has lasted too many years.7 By the sixth century B.C.E., the Greeks had brought their culture, religion, and mythology to the people living in Italy, where the Judgment of Paris myth became widely known. From the fifth century B.C.E., the Etruscans were particularly fond of illustrating scenes from the Judgment myth and the Trojan epic in their art. As Roman religion was influenced by and conflated with that of Greece, Venus, an older Italic vegetal goddess, assumed the mythic role of Aphrodite. Venus became the love goddess who championed the Trojan cause and promoted and safeguarded her son Ae neas, conceived by the mortal Anchises. Because Venus was the deity urging great men on to fulfill their destinies, she became the goddess of conquer ing heroes.8 The Roman conqueror Lucius Cornelius Sulla, using the epithet Epaphroditus, or "favorite of Aphrodite," chose Venus as his patron. After laying siege to Pompeii, Sulla officially named the town Colonia Veneria 5 Ibid., 292. 6 Homer, Iliad 5.393-94. 7 Campbell, 157-163. 8 Both the Greek Aphrodite and the Roman Venus are complex goddesses.

Our stock therefore has at once the sanctity of kings, whose power is supreme among mortal men, and the claim to reverence which attaches to the gods, who hold sway over kings themselves."'1 Temples were conse crated in Venus's name by warring Roman generals: Pompey vowed a temple to Venus Victrix in 55 B.C.E., and Caesar promised to dedicate a temple to Venus if victorious at the Battle of Pharsalus in 50 B.C.E. Augustus, as heir of Caesar, wisely exploited his relationship with the divine Julius Caesar and his truly divine ancestor, Venus." The story was retold and the myth kept alive by Virgil in the Aeneid, written under the eye of the emperor Augustus. Venus was certainly a man's goddess in this epic, using her feminine wiles to assure the continuity of the heroic male Trojan line through Caesar and Augustus. Venus repeatedly cajoled Jupiter to intercede in her son Aeneas's favor; seduced her crippled husband, Vulcan, to forge armor making Aeneas invincible in battle; and relentlessly prodded the hero Aeneas to complete his manly tasks. The conquering Roman generals Sulla and Caesar and the emperor Augustus could not ask for a better mother than Venus. More than a mere ally of the male will, the goddess Venus had become, by the first century c.E., a pawn in the propaganda machine of the Augustan Empire. Pompeii and the House of Venus Marina The destruction of the small Roman town Pompeii by Vesuvius in 79 C.E. has provided us with a rich source of archaeological and epigraphical material about religious life. In addition to the Capitolium honoring Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva at the northern end of the forum, the town boasted impressive temples to Venus, Apollo, and Isis. Ancient Pompeii is also a valuable source in the study of Roman domestic religion, because it is possi ble to enter the ancient Pompeian homes where religious rites were once practiced daily before small household shrines, or lararia. Frequently lo cated in atria, kitchens, or enclosed gardens, these lararia took the form of 9 Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (CIL) 10.787.

The lararia especially located in gardens were often adjacent to more extensive paintings. It is one such garden painting in the Pompeian house at 2.3.3 that is the focus of this essay (see fig. 1).12 At the time of Vesuvius's eruption in 79 C.E., the house of Venus Marina (2.3.3) was being repainted and repaired, having incurred damage during the destructive earthquake of 62-63 C.E. The home itself is an impressive atrium house (see fig. 2) with a large formal dining room or oecus (5), a peristyle and garden (8), a sitting room (11), and adjoining bedrooms or cubicula. The kitchen, which once contained a lararium painting, is located at the rear (18), and two small shrine rooms or sacella are found opposite (12, 13). The painting of Venus on the south garden wall (see appendix) was completed only shortly before the eruption and hence is one of the best preserved garden paintings in Pompeii today. It should be noted that this painting was given priority over the rest of the house decoration, which remained unfinished in 79 C.E. In the house of Venus Marina, the peristyle was enclosed on the north, west, and part of the east sides by a total of nine stuccoed columns, each painted white on the top and gold on the bottom. A garden was planted in the open area set off by the peristyle, although the type of plants remains unknown. 3 A gutter ran alongside the garden to carry off rainwater. The painting, consisting of three panels (A, B, C) and totaling more than twenty-five square meters, filled the entire southern wall of the garden and peristyle. This painting was truly the focus of the household. In fact, the house was designed so that one could stand in the atrium, look through the peri 12 For information on house 2.3.3, see Amedeo Maiuri, Pompeii: Guidebook to the Museums and Monuments of Italy (Rome: Instituto Poligrafico dello Stato, 1970), 83-84 and Maiuri, Roman Painting (Geneva: Albert Skira, 1953), 7, 125; Eugenio La Rocca, Mariette de Vos, and Arnold de Vos, Pompei, Ercolano, Stabia Guida archeologiche (Milan: Arnoldo Mondadori, 1994), 258-59; Wilhelmina Jashemski, Gardens of Pompeii (New Rochelle: Caratzas Brothers, vol. 1, 1979; vol. 2, 1993), 1:63-64, 80-81, and figs. 101-102, 128-29, 203-204, and 2:84, 223, 330-31, and fig. 382; Karl Schefold, Die Wande Pompejis (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1957), 7; Irene Bragantini et al., Picture e Pavimenti di Pompei: Region 1 (Rome: Instituto Centrale per II Catalogo e La Documentazione, 1981), 223-24.

Unfortunately, identification is not possible in 2.3.3: the house was excavated in 1952.</page><page sequence="6">104 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion style, and see Venus depicted on the south garden wall. Indeed, a family member, slave, or guest could constantly view the painting unless he or she were inside one of the small bedrooms, the sitting room, or the kitchen; moving around in the house, he or she by necessity passed before the paint ing. Even guests reclining in the large formal dining room (5) could gaze at the painting through a window. Further, the area of the painting was set off as sacred space by the presence of four sacella with altars and ledges for sacrifice. The southern part of this house was most unique in its ritual use, with two shrines adjacent to the painting on the southeastern side (12, 13), a niche cut into the south westernmost panel, and a lararium painting found in the kitchen (18) at the southwestern end of the peristyle. This area to the south of the garden was very sacred, and apparently ritual was conducted in close proximity of the painting, as one of the altars was in use at the time of the eruption in 79 c.E.14 Although garden paintings similar to the one at 2.3.3 have been found in the richest and poorest of Pompeian homes, their function is not entirely understood. It is agreed that garden paintings provided an attractive envi ronment as well as extended the sense of space when painted on a back wall. Yet I also believe that some garden paintings served as sacred paintings and were a form of a religious and even unconscious expression containing archetypal symbols drawn from past memory. We will never fully know how a work of art was perceived in the classical world, yet the Sophist Philostratus (b. 190 C.E.) provides some clues. He explained in his work on the arts, Imagines, that a painted landscape scene does not merely represent the natural world but also conveys a message through iconography. Philostratus challenged the observer to move to a symbolic level for a fuller appreciation of the work of art. When praising the realistic rendering of nature, according to Philostratus, "we praise an insignificant feature of the painting and one that has to do solely with imita tion; but we should not be praising its cleverness or the sense of fitness it shows, though these [cleverness and fitness], I believe, are the most im portant elements of art."'5 In the garden painting at 2.3.3, then, we can praise the correct shape of a myrtle leaf or the coloring of a bird's feather, but to grasp the true meaning we must discover a pathway into the ancient artist's and patron's perception of nature and their relationship to the physi cal world. It is our challenge to understand this "landscape of the mind" of the ancient Pompeian by examining the imagery and symbolism. 14 Matteo Della Corte, Case ed Abitanti di Pompei (Naples: Fausto Fiorentino, 1965), 384-86. 15 Philostratus, Imagines 1.308.19-25.

Assuredly, the portrayal of a naked woman lying in a shell would trigger in the minds of Pompeians a series of images and associations, connections and thoughts about the other, much older Goddess Venus that were derived from mythol ogy and tradition. As you read the following passages, keep in mind the painting at 2.3.3. Notice how the landscape slowly becomes more than an imitation of nature and that the images bridge into a landscape of the mind connected by what Marija Gimbutas calls the "language of the Goddess." These motifs, both literary and pictorial, are drawn from the memory of the ancient Pompeian homeowner and from a tradition of images long associated with this prepatriarchal Goddess. In the literature, art, and cult practices of ancient Rome, common themes of fertility, creation, death, and rebirth ap pear often, incorporating marine, terrestrial, and chthonic qualities associ ated with the Goddess.16 This Venus was an aquatic deity, honored on islands surrounded by water, especially Cythera and Cyprus where she was born of sea foam, or in temples set on high cliffs overlooking the coast, as at Acrocorinth in Greece and Eryx in Sicily. The temple of Venus at Pompeii mirrors this theme, as it is situated on a cliff facing the southwest, overlooking the conflux of the Sarno River and the Mediterranean Sea. The Goddess is depicted with sea life and shells; dolphin, tuna, periwinkle, and scallop are sacred to her. She is often accompanied in statuary and painting by waterfowl such as the swan. She is born of the sea and never leaves the water far behind. This Goddess is set in the liquid and humid elements. In the Theogony, Hesiod narrates the birth of Aphrodite, and as this passage is the subject of the painting in 2.3.3, it is worth repeating. Aphrod ite arises from a white foam floating on the sea, "and in it there grew a maiden. First she drew near holy Cythera and from there, afterwards, she came to sea-girt Cyprus and came forth an awful and lovely goddess and grass grew up about her beneath her shapely feet. Her gods and men call Aphrodite. . . ."17 Her birth from the sea is reaffirmed in Homeric Hymn 16 See Marija Gimbutas's Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe, 6500-3500 B.C., rev. ed. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1982); The Language of the Goddess (San Fran cisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1989); and The Civilization of the Goddess: The World of Old Europe (San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 1991). Pausanias, Description of Greece 1.1.3, mentions the celestial, marine, and terrestrial qualities of Aphrodite. 17 Hesiod, Theogony 166. The source of the foam is the severed genitals of Uranus, according to Hesiod. Homer, Iliad 5.312, describes an alternate version of Aphrodite's birth, with Dione as her mother.

There the moist breath of the western wind wafted her over the waves of the loud moaning sea in soft foam, and there the gold filleted Hours welcomed her joyously. They clothed her with heavenly garments: on her head they put a fine, well-wrought crown of gold, and in her pierced ears they hung orna ments of orichalc and precious gold, and adorned her with golden necklaces over her soft neck and snow-white breasts. .. ."18 She was an ornithic Goddess frequently associated with birds, especially the dove seen resting on her head, in her hand, at her side, or held to her breast. Other birds sacred to the Goddess are the partridge, the wryneck, and the sparrow. Water birds such as the swan, goose, and duck are also often identified with her.1 She appears as mistress of the beasts in Homeric Hymn no. 5: "So she came to many-fountained Ida, the mother of wild creatures and went straight to the homestead across the mountains. After her came grey wolves, fawning on her, and grim-eyed lions; and bears and fleet leopards, ravenous for deer: and she was glad in heart to see them and put desire in their breasts so that they all mated two together, about the shadowy coombes." Other animals special to the Goddess include the pig (when associated with Adonis), ram, goat, bull, kid, lamb, and hare.20 She is at the same time an earthy yet intrinsically golden deity, "the most golden of the goddesses" being the epithet most frequently used for her. She is bedecked in gold jewelry, the most precious metal mined from the earth and one used for sacred objects. For Aphrodite, though, golden refers also to her radiant beauty and brilliance.21 This Goddess was a vegetation deity. To the Greeks, Aphrodite was a flower goddess. The myrtle, rose, poppy, pomegranate, and apple were her fruits and flowers. The myrtle, an evergreen with white flowers and black or white berries, was sacred to Aphrodite throughout the Mediterranean. It was a female sexual symbol yet also was associated with death and conse quent resurrection. The apple belonged to Aphrodite and is of mythic im portance, frequently suggesting immortality or rebirth. The rose likewise is associated with female power as the special flower of Aphrodite and Isis. Yet all fragrant blossoms are special to the Goddess: "She clothed herself with garments .. . made for her and dyed in flowers of spring-such flowers as the Seasons wear-in crocus and hyacinth and flourishing violet and the rose's lovely bloom, so sweet and delicious, and heavenly buds, the flowers 18 Homeric Hymn 6.1-10. 19 Friedrich (cited above, n. 8), 76; Farnell, 674-676, 756 n. 114. 20 Homeric Hymn 5.68-74.

In such perfumed garments Aphrodite is clothed at all seasons."2 The poet Sappho also feels the power of Aphrodite, leaving the golden home of Zeus in your bridled chariot. Beautiful swift sparrows bore you, eddying through the mid-air, their wings a-whirr, from heaven to the dark earth, and there they were Now come to me once again, and free me from these aching sorrows.

The Goddess speaks: "The holy heaven yearns to wound the earth and yearning layeth hold on the earth to join in wedlock; the rain, fallen from the amorous heaven, impregnates the earth and it bringeth forth for mankind the food for flocks and herds and Demeter's gifts; and from that moist marriage rite the woods put on their bloom. Of all these things I am the cause."24 To the Romans, Venus was the goddess of the garden. Varro named Venus patroness of the farmer, and Pliny the Elder knew Venus as guardian 22 Cypria 6.1-7.

An inscription found on a vase unearthed at Pompeii was inscribed, "Allow me pure wine; then may Venus who guards the garden love you."25 For the Romans of Campania, Venus was often worshiped in joint cults with Ceres, the grain goddess. The cults were merged at Sorrento, and the goddesses shared a woman priest at Pompeii.26 At Eryx a sacrifice of herbs was made to Venus and she was worshiped at altars scented with flowers and perfume.27 Latin authors responded to the generative powers of Venus, as in Lucre tius's following descriptive invocation. These lines were well known to Pom peians, as they were found scribbled on the walls of the ancient city in at least five locations:28 Mother of Aeneas and his race, darling of men and gods, nurturing Venus who beneath the smooth-moving heavenly signs fillest with thyself the sea full-laden with ships, the earth with her kindly fruits, since through thee every generation of living things is conceived and rising up looks on the light of the sun: from thee, 0 Goddess, from thee, the winds flee away, the clouds of heaven from thee, and thy coming; for thee the wonder-working earth puts forth sweet flowers, for thee the wide stretches of ocean laugh, and heaven grown peaceful glows with outpoured light. For as soon as the vernal face of day is made manifest, and the breeze of the teeming south wind blows fresh and free, thee first the fowls of the air proclaim, thee divine one, and thy advent, pierced to the heart by the might: next the herds go wild and dance over the rich pastures and swim across rapid rivers, so greedily does each one follow thee, held captive by thy charm, whither thou goest on to lead them. Aye, throughout seas and moun tains and sweeping torrents and the leafy dwellings of birds and verdant plains, striking soft love into the breasts of all creatures, thou dost cause them greedily to beget their generations after their kind. Since therefore thou alone dost govern the nature of things, since without thee nothing comes forth into the shining borders of light, nothing joyous and lovely is made, thee I crave as partner in writing the verses, which I essay to fashion touching the Nature of Things.... 29 Ovid also praises Venus as creatrix in the Fasti: "She created all the gods-'twere long to number them; she bestowed on seeds and trees their 25 CIL 4.2776. 6 Notizie degli scavi di antichitd (1890): 333. 27 Varro, De Re Rustica .1.1.6; Pliny, Naturalis Historia 19.50. For a discussion of Venus in the garden, see Jashemski (cited above, n. 12), 1:124-31. An unusual epithet, "Venus Fisica," appears three times at Pompeii (CIL 4.1540, 928, suppl. 2.6865) and once in Lucania (CIL 10.203). This might be a transliteration of the Greek physica. Schilling (cited above, n. 8), suggests that "Venus Fisica" refers to a natural or vegetal Goddess recalling the attributes so beautifully described by Lucretius. 28 CIL 4.3072, 3118, 3139, 3913, 4373. 29 Lucretius, De Rerum Natura 1.1-25.</page><page sequence="11">Stahl Bernstein: This is Where I Found Her 109 origins .... The same force preserves all living things under the broad bosom of the deep, and fills the waters with unnumbered fish."30 As goddess of vegetation, she was also associated with death and rebirth. Most obvious is Aphrodite's involvement with Adonis and Persephone. A myth describes Aphrodite's love affair with the mortal Adonis and hence her association with the underworld. Adonis, a most beautiful young man, was born from an incestuous union. His mother, Myrrha, was condemned with a passion for her own father, the king of Assyria. Myrrha seduced her un knowing father for nine nights during the Thesmophoria, was discovered, and was pursued until she was changed into a tree, the weeping myrrh. Nine months later Adonis emerged from the tree.31 Aphrodite fell in love with the handsome youth and entrusted him to Persephone, who refused to return him. Zeus resolved the conflict by announcing that Adonis would live four months of the year with Persephone, four with Aphrodite, and four where he chose. He was later killed while hunting, and his blood stains the anemone, whereas that of Aphrodite, who ran to his aid, stains the rose red. In the hot summer months when plants would wither and die, women climbed to their rooftops to plant the gardens of Adonis in earthen pots sown with fennel, lettuce, wheat, or barley. As the seedlings quickly germi nated and withered because of the intense heat, the women would then mourn the shriveled seedlings as the dying Adonis. At Pompeii, a wall painting shows the death of Adonis with women climbing to a roof to mourn the dying vegetation and the dying Adonis.32 A fascinating Hellenistic mime by Theocritus of the Alexandrian school describes a ritual to Adonis hosted by the wife of the pharaoh and attended by two Alexandrian women, Gorgo and Praxinoe. The mime includes a hymn to Adonis. The reference to the death of the heroes in contrast to the rebirth of Adonis is most pertinent: GORGO: Hush, Praxinoe! The Argive woman's daughter, the famous singer, is going to sing the Adonis. She won the prize last year for dirge-singing. I'm sure she'll give us something lovely. See, she's clearing her throat.

Dear to us has thine advent been, Ad onis, and dear shall it be when thou comest again.33 The Great Goddess of Old Europe Keeping this literary tradition in mind, I turn now to Marija Gimbutas's grouping of symbols. From artifacts of Old European culture, circa 7000 3500 B.C.E., Gimbutas in The Language of the Goddess identifies four inter related categories of symbols: "life-giving," "the renewing and eternal earth," "death and regeneration," and "energy and unfolding." The connec tion of the feminine and water that originated in the Paleolithic is key in Gimbutas's symbolic set of the Goddess as Life Giver. Woman was creatrix and life giver; her body was a mysterious and awesome source of life. Liquid was tied to this magical process at a very early period, for from moisture of the female, human and animal life is born and nourished. Moisture comes from a woman's body not just from her womb but from her eyes as tears, from her mouth as saliva, and from her breasts as milk. Her life-giving waters were considered essential for the survival of a people and were sa cred, worshiped as the body of Great Mother, the Creatrix. Moisture or water itself came to represent the creative process necessary for human, animal, and vegetal procreation.34 Since Paleolithic times, birds in general, and especially waterfowl, have been associated with the divine female. This rich group of symbols, common romains a la fin de la republique et aux premiers siecles de l'empire (1943; reprint, Paris: Presses Universitaires des France, 1969), 59-60. 33 Theocritus, Idylls 15, in Theocritus, Bion and Moschus, trans.

Water birds espe cially recall the close connection between aquatic and female images. The life-giving Goddess of Old Europe, Gimbutas argues, was often seen mani fest as a water bird or Bird Goddess. Even in classical Greek art and litera ture, the goddesses retained their bird attributes: Athena, her owl; Hera, her peacock; Aphrodite, her dove and sparrow. During the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods, geometric designs com prised a very special religious language, according to Gimbutas. Designs that showed the Goddess as Creatrix were often framed or engraved on statuettes. The net design, in conjunction with water imagery, appeared in the Neolithic, implying to Gimbutas that the net was a symbol of the water of life. Chevrons were symbols in Old Europe that suggested the life-giving moisture flowing from the Goddess's body and were often seen in conjunc tion with water birds and aquatic imagery. The V or chevron, often repeated to form a VV pattern, is a stylized symbol of the pubic triangle of the female, that mysterious source of creation. The second of Marija Gimbutas's categories is the "renewing and eternal earth," with symbols of fertility, potency, and abundance essential for the continuity of life constantly threatened by death. "Fertility symbols are sea sonal," writes Gimbutas, "representing dying and awakening nature. Mother Earth rises as a young goddess in all her splendor in the spring and becomes an old hag in the fall, but her spring/summer pregnancy is the holiest time there is."35 Although a pregnant female body is the most obvious image of the Earth Mother, she is earth's fertility incarnate, and everything born from the earth is born from her: "Flower, tree, stone, shell, human and animal alike are born from the earth, and all possess her strength .... The Earth Mother creates a cover for the earth that is lush, blossoming and enchanted."36 The Goddess of Death and Regeneration is the third category of Gimbu tas's study. To die and be reborn reflected the power of the Goddess and became a popular source of imagery during the Neolithic. The Bird Goddess appeared in a death guise as a vulture or owl. Birds in flight, while suggesting birth and the fecundity of nature, might also represent the souls of the dead. The Goddess was incarnate in small birds such as the cuckoo and dove. According to Gimbutas, the early Gorgon was a Goddess of Life and Death, not the later Greek monster slain by Perseus. Hence, the Gorgon mask reflected the powerful Goddess of Death and Regeneration, especially when seen in connection with birds or elongated white figures. A distinctive 3 Gimbutas, Language of the Goddess (cited above, n. 16), 139. 36 Ibid., 159.</page><page sequence="14">112 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion type of figure and symbol of death found often in graves from the Paleolithic to the Bronze Age is the thin, elongated, frontal nude white female. White, the color of bones-not black-apparently was the color associated with death. Gimbutas sees these figures as manifestations of the Goddess as Death Wielder and Regeneratrix. Birds, snakes, vegetation, the male consort, and associated geometric designs each connote birth and regeneration to Gimbutas. Male deities in antiquity such as Attis, Osiris, and Adonis, serving as consorts of the God dess, became symbols of rising and dying vegetation. Likewise, the number three had special meaning in Old Europe and retained sanctity in the classi cal era as the sacred triad of female, consort, and offspring, thus signifying death and rebirth. Many of these images and symbols that Gimbutas attri butes to the Paleolithic and Neolithic can also be found in the first century C.E. in Pompeian homes. Venus in the Garden at 2.3.3 The painting on the south garden wall of 2.3.3 measures more than twenty-five square meters and consists of three panels separated by a yellow gold border. The central panel with Venus (B) has a narrow, brown frame, whereas the left (A) and right (C) side panels are each encircled by a garland of green ivy dotted with white berries. In the center of each garland border at the top is painted a whitish mask with snakelike brown hair. Across the bottom of all three panels runs a painted golden lattice fence. Plants in a variety of green shades; white, yellow, and reddish flowers; ripening fruit; and various birds of brown, white, gray, yellow, and blue hue set on a back ground of blue sky fill the side panels. It is, however, the central panel with Venus that first draws the eye. (Refer to the appendix for a detailed descrip tion of each panel.) The association of a nude woman with water strikes the viewer immedi ately upon seeing this almost life-size painting. Venus rises from the ocean, born of water from the foam, literally a Goddess of the sea. This is clear in the painting and can't be missed as she emerges in a shell, ocean-born. In addition to the blue-green ocean in the central panel, water representations and allusions abound throughout all the panels. Fountains of varied shapes are a common type of ornamentation found in Pompeian garden paintings. The garden at 2.3.3 boasts six elegant crater or egg-shaped fountains painted on the southern and eastern walls (D-H, C). We can only visualize the actual garden complementing the six spouting fountains painted on the walls of this sacred area, with plants and possibly real splashing pools and fountains producing the sound of gurgling water to play on the senses. Imagine a chalice fountain bowl gushing forth water, and the birthing imagery is very apparent and very female. Interestingly, only</page><page sequence="15">Stahl Bernstein: This is Where I Found Her 113 one panel (A) is without a crater fountain or flowing water, and that is the panel painted with a male consort. Marine life, fish, and shells, which connote water and hence the life giving Goddess, are seen in the central panel as props of Venus herself. From the viewer's perspective, to the left of Venus and moving away from her, a dolphin breaks the water's surface. Not only is Venus reclining in a huge scallop-edged shell, but she also wears a delicate golden shell around her neck. Closer examination identifies the shell as a cowrie, representative of female genitalia. Golden shell-shaped earrings dangle from her ears. A viewer is immediately struck by the number of birds painted on these garden walls; they are seen perched or flying about in all panels. There are eight birds in panel A: two gray-brown herons, a large yellow bird perched on a tree, a smaller bird sitting on shrubbery, a song thrush on a pine, two birds in flight, and one hanging upside down, pecking at fruit. Eight birds can be seen in panel C as well: a bird sits on top of a myrtle, a large bird perches on an oleander, two herons sit astride a fence, a yellow bird drinks from a fountain while a pigeon sits on the rim, and a shrike perches on an oleander while another flies toward the fountain. Two birds, including a song thrush, can be found in panel G; a large wood pigeon and two other birds in flight are painted in panel H; two birds are found in panel F; and two birds each in panels D and E. Of special religious significance is the net design set off in a frame, symbolizing the life-giving power of the Goddess. The net motif most appar ent in these garden paintings is found incorporated in the painted fence that runs beneath all the panels. Within each small, reticulated square is possibly a stylized leaf. The fence is framed by a top rail of three painted parallel lines, which likewise have meaning to Gimbutas. From Upper Paleo lithic times, three lines appear concurrently with fish, nets, and snakes and symbolize perhaps the power that flows from the body of the Bird Goddess, the Giver and Sustainer of Life. The chevron design is found at the border of Venus's billowing cape; realistic drapery does not blow in the wind pointed in perfect chevrons. The angle of Venus's leg creates a V shape silhouetted against the background. Most obvious, the pubic area of the Goddess is a painted V. The focus on the pubic area of Venus is intentional. Since earliest times, humans have honored the birthing process and feminine power, often mak ing abstract representations of the womb and vulva, which, according to Gimbutas, were commonly depicted in the Paleolithic and Neolithic as egg shaped ovals. In early statuettes, emphasis was on the full or pregnant stom ach, full breasts, and the pubic area. In this painting, however, Venus is not giving birth but in fact is being birthed herself. Nonetheless, the emphasis is on her pelvic triangle or V shape. Scholars have commented that the painting is poorly executed and not "well done" because of the disproportion</page><page sequence="16">114 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion of the head to the larger body and the awkward angle of the legs. Yet I suggest that the purpose is not to show an accurate representation of a female body but to emphasis the pelvic area as the source of life-giving female power and sexuality. In truth, that is where the viewer's eye is drawn. Care is not placed on the distorted foot, which in myth is a disfigurement caused by Venus's husband, Vulcan. The dominant oval shape of Venus's thighs is repeated in this panel in the oval shape at the bottom of the shell and in the shell itself, an oval with a soft pink lining. The billowing drapery likewise suggests a vulvar oval shape, as do the curves of the fish and the standard carried by the cupid. The cowrie shell Venus wears around her neck mimics female genitalia. Even the oval shapes of the chalice fountains gurgling with life-giving water and surrounded by birds and vegetation draw connection to the female body, water, and the source of creation-the life-giving Goddess. An evening spent in the blossoming garden before the lushly painted scenes in house 2.3.3 must have been enchanting, invoking the fertility and abundance of the Goddess incarnate in all vegetation. Ivy, a tree with applelike fruit, a pomegranate tree in fruit, a myrtle bush, rosebushes, oleanders, daisies, and a pine with ripe cones are painted in various shades of green, together with a variety of plants that cannot be identified. Green boughs were painted even on the inside of the lararium in panel C. Just as vegetation rises and grows in the spring and flourishes in the summer, it withers and dies in the fall and winter. The metaphors for rising and dying vegetation were often youths and consorts of the Goddess: "Forest spirits and gods, dying and self-renewing vegetation gods known from the myths of historic times, may have their antecedents in deep prehistory."37 Adonis was one of these deities, birthed from a tree, living part of the year with Persephone in the underworld, beloved of Aphrodite, dying as a beauti ful youth, and causing women to mourn at the Adonia. In the southwestern panel A, an elongated white male figure stands slightly off-center before the fence. Interestingly, he is a statue of a male, with a helmet, spear and shield, in contrast to Venus in the central panel. Most scholars identify the male statue with helmet, spear and shield as Mars, although he does not appear very warlike. He may be more closely linked to Mamers, an old Italic vegetal deity, and, as I believe, conflated with Adonis, consort of the Goddess. This male figure is juxtaposed in panel C with a female symbol, the white cra ter fountain. Masks are frequently associated with death in the Roman world. Masks of ancestors were kept in small recessed areas off the atrium and were used at funerals. Three masks with large eyes and snakelike hair are painted above 37 Ibid., 175.</page><page sequence="17">Stahl Bernstein: This is Where I Found Her 115 panels H, A, and C, and mask paintings also line the walls of the peristyle on the western side. The number three is repeated in the number of panels on the south wall, the three lines on the border, and the three figures in the central panel. The three panels on the south garden wall, then, on a symbolic level convey the message of death and regeneration. In panel A the stiff, white male statue is a dying god; in panel C the chalice and water serve as birthing images. Central to the cyclical process of death and birth for vegetal, animal, and human life is the Goddess Venus seen in the middle panel. Yet this Venus is not the love and lust goddess of Homer or Virgil, nor the helper of heroes. This Goddess is much more complex, and her roots go deep into European soil. She is all-encompassing as giver of life and source of regenerative female energy suggested in each and every painted image and symbol. Further, the power of these symbols is not found in isolation but in combination as they become a "language." Within twenty five square meters of painted wall surface can be seen masks, a stiff white figure, shells, flowing water, fish, birds, waterfowl, myrtle, apple, a variety of lush vegetation, vulva shapes, the chalice, the snake, the net design, the chevron, triple lines, triple panels, triple figures, and duplicate figures of herons and amorini. Gimbutas's perception of this language of the Goddess in Old Europe should be valued. This language is archetypal, revolving around the sacred female and communicated in part on an unconscious level. And it is not a dead language, as I came to understand. While working at Pompeii for the past three years, a most interesting phenomenon surfaced, one I would like to share with you, for it was pro foundly meaningful and completely unexpected. At the dinner table in the evenings, team members began to share dreams that they had experienced after working for days in front of the wall paintings in the ancient homes. The dreams were often mythic and revolved around an image or symbol from the painted scenes, such as a dog or a labyrinth. Some of us came to realize that symbols painted more than two thousand years ago and de scribed by Gimbutas comprised, in effect, a living language that spoke to us on a dream level. To our amazement, we could understand the language and respond in dreams, interacting with the deepest and most personal aspects of our inner lives. In the dream I describe below, I experienced a joyous sense of sacred space and connection with the spirit of renewal that seemed to spring from the garden painting of Venus Marina. So, I close with my own vivid dream about a yellow bird much like the one perched on the rim of the chalice fountain in the southeastern panel: I am a young woman walking through a lush tropical jungle, following a path under trees, when a bird, very small and bright yellow with green wingtips, flies close to me. It hovers and scares me. Then it founders in air and falls right into my hands. It is alive but wounded. I stroke the yellow</page><page sequence="18">116 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion feathers, knowing that the bird needs help; it needs my healing. Now I sit inside a house perched on a hilltop and watch the mist in the valley below. I hear a scratching noise from the basement and move down the steps care fully with a flashlight. The ground is unpaved and I see movement in the dirt. It is a yellow bird wounded and in need of nurturing. I cradle the bird and dig carefully in the sacred space. I strike something my hands feel is hard, bones of an animal very old, the remains of an ancient sacrifice. Appendix: The Painted Panels in the Garden of Venus Marina I have arranged the garden paintings at 2.3.3 into eight panels, begin ning with those on the south garden wall.38 The South Garden Wall: Panels A-C Panel A Moving from the far left to the right, an oleander with pink blossoms stands next to a myrtle with white blossoms. A heron is standing next to a tree with red fruit or flowers. Then another flowering oleander is depicted, along with a pine on which perches a song thrush eating a berry, with another bird overhead in flight. A painted white statue of a nude male with helmet, spear and shield (often identified as Mars or the Italic Mamers) is surrounded by vegetation. Behind the male statue is an oleander, a tall tree with yellow fruit, more oleanders, and another heron. The panel is framed by an ivy garland with white berries, one of which is being eaten by a small bird hanging upside down. Panel B Venus is boldly painted on a giant whitish pink shell floating on the blue-green sea and accompanied by two amorini. Panel C On the left is a myrtle bush with white berries and a mound of ivy with white berries; a bird flies overhead. Next, a large bird perches on an olean der in blossom, with the heron, a fern, and a rosebush nearby. A fountain is beautifully painted on the south wall at the western end of the garden. It stands in front of the fence in the center of the painting and stands on a delicately carved, leaf-shaped pedestal. A yellow bird is perched on the left rim, drinking water from the basin, while a pigeon sits on the right rim. To the right of the fountain is a myrtle, an oleander on which a gray shrike is 38 For a complete identification and description, see Jashemski, 1:80-81, and 2:223, 330-31.</page><page sequence="19">Stahl Bernstein: This is Where I Found Her 117 perched, a heron, and a tall tree with yellow apples. Another myrtle and a clump of ivy stand next to a small lararium niche. Exterior Walls of Room 11: Panels D-F The exterior walls of the small room (11) are painted with garden scenes, although the top sections of the panels have been damaged. Panels D, E, and F on the northern and eastern walls of room 11 are beautifully painted in soft greens and blues with a reddish brown border. A lattice fence is painted along the bottom of the panels. Panel D (Northern Exterior Wall) In panel D, to the north of the window, among plants that cannot be identified stands a footed, bowl-shaped fountain with a bird perched on the right rim. Panel E (Eastern Exterior Wall) In the better-preserved panel E, a bowl-shaped fountain jetting water stands behind a fence, with a brown bird depicted on the left rim and a white bird on the right. A tree with applelike fruit is shown on the left of the fountain, a pomegranate tree in fruit stands directly behind the fountain, and a flowering myrtle bush is on the right. Roses and ivy appear in the foreground on either side of the fountain. Panel F (Eastern Exterior Wall) Panel F on the exterior wall of room 11 is only partially preserved, yet a viewer can make out a footed, bowl-shaped, square-brimmed fountain standing behind a painted fence. A bird perches on the right of this fountain. Just above the fence are yellow-orange flowers, with oleanders in the back ground. To the left of the fountain are daisies, and a tall bush with a little bird is on the right side of the panel. Exterior Walls of Room 13: Panels G-H Panels G and H are painted on a golden background with a reddish brown border and topped with a draped ivy garland. Panel G (Northern Exterior Wall) Panel G, on the north wall, contains an impressive footed, egg-shaped, whitish marble fountain with two handles at the rim. Three figures are painted on the fountain in high relief, with Minerva in the center. A crater fountain bubbles water on a pedestal in front of the fence. Behind the fence and to the left of the fountain stands a rosebush, and directly behind the fountain is a tall, thin, flowering bush with a bird sitting on a branch to the</page><page sequence="20">118 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion left. A song thrush flying toward the bush and another flowering shrub are on the right of the fountain. Panel H (Eastern Exterior Wall) In panel H, on the east wall of room 13 and to the left of the doorway, is another two-handled crater fountain jetting water. It stands in front of a fence, with shrubbery painted in the garden beyond. Directly behind the fountain appears a pine tree with many ripe cones; a large wood pigeon sits on the top, and another bird flies toward the tree.</page><page sequence="21">&lt; ~I'f?H;LB IbWBP~ X i.... ..~3~ Ar ti.
