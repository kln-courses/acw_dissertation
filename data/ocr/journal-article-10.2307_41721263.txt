<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophy and Phenomenological Research Vol. LXXXV No. 3, November 2012 Â© 2012 Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, LLC Intellectualism and the Objects of Knowledge ROBERT STALNAKER MIT Know How1 is a defense of a thesis that Jason Stanley calls " Intellectual- ism " which he characterizes as the thesis that "knowing how is a species of knowing that". I am persuaded that the thesis is true, but this still leaves me with plenty to object to in the way the thesis is developed and defended: in particular, in the way that the objects of knowledge are explained. I'll get to that, but I am going to start with an apparently superficial reservation: a small point that I think matters for the way the thesis is understood. In the second part of my comments, I will cast a critical eye on the putatively Fregean or neo-Fregean notion of a mode of presentation, as Stanley explains it. As I said, I think the thesis is true, but I don't like the label, "intellectu- alism". The thesis, as I think it should be understood, would be more accu- rately labeled "anti-intellectualism". I don't think Stanley will disagree with me here. The irony of the label, which he takes from Ryle, is not lost on him, since he has defended a different but related epistemological thesis (in his previous book, Knowledge and Practical Interests ) that is labeled "anti- intellectualism". But I think the label for the doctrine defended in this book is misleading for several reasons. Most of the discussion in epistemology, in Ryle' s time and since, presup- poses an "intellectualist" conception of knowledge: knowledge is justified true belief, painted over with a Gettier-proof coating of some kind. Knowl- edge is manifested in linguistic expression - in the assertion of what is known, and in the defense of one's assertion by giving reasons to justify one's belief. Knowledge, according to this picture, is at least in the normal case accessible to consciousness, which means that knowers have the capac- ity to articulate what they know. It would appear that paradigm cases of 1 Stanley, 2011.

Propositional knowledge resides in the space of rea- sons (to use an old Sellarsian term that John McDowell revived), while knowledge-how does not. But (a defender of intellectualism might argue), despite appearances, knowing-how does fit this picture, and does belong in the space of reasons. This is how Stanley's defense of intellectualism is often understood, and I think the critics are right that this is scarcely credi- ble. Michael Devitt, for example, in a criticism of Stanley's thesis notes that it is reasonable to ascribe certain cognitive capacities to a desert ant, "but to attribute any propositional attitudes to the ant simply on the strength of that competence seems like soft-minded anthropomorphism".2 The right response to Devitt and others who are presupposing the intellectualist picture is to agree that the paradigm cases of knowing-how do not fit the intellectualist picture of propositional knowledge, but to argue that this is because the traditional intellectualist conception is a wrongheaded account of propositional knowledge, mistaking one narrow range of cases of knowledge-that for the general case. In some cases, knowledge may be manifested in the assertion and defense of what one knows, but in general, propositional knowledge is the possession of information and the capacity to use that information to guide one's actions. The action of asserting what one knows is just one special case of an action that mani- fests one's cognitive capacity. The paradigm cases of knowing-how (according to Stanley's thesis) are also cases of the possession of infor- mation, and the capacity to access it for the purpose of guiding one's action. If we focus on knowledge-how as a species of propositional knowledge, this will be a useful corrective to the intellectualist concep- tion of knowledge. The upshot of Stanley's thesis, I am suggesting, should be the rejection of the intellectualist picture. This is why I find the thesis plausible, and important. The label, "intellectualism" originates with Ryle, but I think the view Ryle was criticizing was not simply Stanley's thesis that knowing-how is a species of knowing-that. His position is more complex. I am not going to try to defend Ryle, since he does implicitly accept the intellectualist picture of knowledge-that, but I think the more general intellectualist view that he was criticizing is a picture that Stanley should also want to reject. (That is, 1 think Ryle was right to criticize the intellectualist view of knowing-how. His mistake was to accept, or at least presuppose, an intellectualist account of knowing-that.) Ryle began his discussion of knowing-how and knowing-that by distin- guishing intelligence from intellect .3 "When we speak of the intellect ... we 2 M. Devitt, 2011. 3 The quotations from Ryle in this paragraph are all from Ryle, 1949, p. 26. BOOK SYMPOSIUM 755</page><page sequence="3">are referring primarily to that special class of operations which constitute theorizing." The main mistake, on Ryle's diagnosis, was to think that our abilities would count as capacity for intelligent behavior only if they were "somehow piloted by the intellectual grasp of true propositions. To be rational [according the intellectualist doctrine] was, therefore, to have one's non-theoretical propensities controlled by one's apprehension of truths about the conduct of life." But, Ryle counters, "Intelligent practice is not the step- child of theory." Ryle is here implicitly identifying cognitive states that involve the possession and use of information with states that are "piloted by the intellectual grasp of true propositions", and taking the "apprehension of truths about the conduct of life" to be the same as the apprehension of truths that results from theoretical reasoning, but once we reject these presuppositions, we can see that Ryle's main target is the intellectualist conception of cognitive or intelligent capacities, and that part of Ryle's view is, I think, supported by Stanley's thesis. More generally, almost all of the criticisms that Stanley discusses and responds to in the book can be seen as deriving from an intellectualist picture of propositional knowledge - one that tends to identify propositional knowledge with conscious aware- ness of a linguistic expression of a proposition that corresponds to the fact that one knows. Many critics of Stanley's thesis have been suspicious of the attempt to get substantive epistemological conclusions out of linguistic arguments about the way that the word "know" functions in natural language. Speak- ing for such critics, Stanley asks, "Why are natural language ascriptions of knowing how to do something relevant at all to inquiry into the nature of knowledge how? One might naturally hold that it is science that will discover the nature of states of knowing how to do something" (131). Stan- ley patiently (perhaps a bit sarcastically) responds to this kind of criticism by noting that the truth schema "'S' is true if and only if S" justifies us in concluding that "Ana knows how to swim" is true if and only if Ana knows how to swim, and this is reason enough to think that a correct semantic account of the sentence ascribing knowledge-how will be relevant to the nature of the state being ascribed. This seems right, as far as it goes, but it does not exclude the possibility that the concept expressed by "know" is a disjunctive one that covers two very different kinds of cognitive state, one of which is the kind of state that makes paradigm cases of "knowing-how" ascriptions true when they are true, and the other the kind of state that makes standard cases of "knowing-that" ascriptions true when they are true. I don't think this is right, but the thought that it is is bolstered by the distinction made by computer scientists and psychologists between proce- dural and declarative knowledge. Stanley discusses this distinction at length, and I agree with his argument that the declarative/procedural distinction, even if it is a clear and sound one, does not touch his modest thesis that 756 ROBERT STALNAKER</page><page sequence="4">knowing-how is a kind of propositional knowledge. Stanley argues persua- sively that one cannot identify declarative knowledge with propositional knowledge. Procedural knowledge is just as propositional as declarative knowledge, so the identification of knowing-how with procedural knowl- edge does not touch the thesis that knowing-how is a kind of knowing-that. This is all Stanley needs to defend his thesis against this objection, but I think it is worth adding that the declarative/procedural distinction is itself a conflation of several different distinctions, each of which is in need of fur- ther clarification. I am inclined to think that the distinction may be less a discovery of empirical cognitive science than an expression of an old intel- lectualist prejudice. At least it is not at all clear that cognitive science pro- vides empirical support for a distinction of this kind that plays any important theoretical role in the explanation of cognition and behavior. As Stanley notes, the distinction between procedural and declarative knowledge has its origin in computer science. The rough idea was to distin- guish knowledge that is explicitly encoded as data and knowledge that is realized in the program, or in the structure of the system. The distinction is difficult to draw in a nonarbitrary manner, even in the computer science context and it is even more problematic as drawn by psychologists and cognitive ethologists, but the idea of the distinction seems to be based on the different ways that information is stored in a system. It is also assumed that what distinguishes declarative knowledge is that it involves a conscious representation of what is known. But conscious accessibility concerns the way that knowledge may be manifested, and not the way that it is stored. Knowledge might be implicit in the sense that it is not stored in explicit linguistic form (as sentences in the belief box, say), but still be accessible to consciousness. One thing that is not accessible to consciousness is the manner in which the information we have access to is stored. Even if we assume the fanciful belief-box model of explicitly stored information, there is no reason to think that one can tell reliably whether one's ability to answer a question is the ability to retrieve a stored sentence from the belief box, or to make an easy inference from explicitly stored information, or the ability to extract the information from a more holistic distributed representa- tion. And the fact that information is not accessible, without doing a non- trivial computation does not imply that it is not explicitly stored in linguistic form, since if the belief box is big enough, search through it may be a difficult computational task. (Even if one had the entire Manhattan phone book in one's belief box, one might not know who has number 212- 466-3947 prior to a long and tedious search through what was stored there.) One might ask exactly what it means to say that something one knows is "accessible to consciousness." In normal cases, when a person exercises her knowledge of how to swim, she knows that she knows how to swim, and she is consciously aware that, in swimming, she is using her knowledge of BOOK SYMPOSIUM 757</page><page sequence="5">how to swim. What she can't do is to articulate her knowledge: to manifest it, not by swimming, but by stating in words what it is that she knows. It is not really consciousness that is at issue, but the ability to manifest one's knowledge in one particular way - in verbal expression. The intellectualist picture tends to assume that this capacity is essential to propositional knowl- edge. Stanley's thesis involves its denial. He embraces this consequence, and I agree that one should. As Stanley emphasizes, the central point of the thesis he calls "intellectu- alism" is that knowing-how is propositional knowledge: like paradigm cases of knowing-that, know how is a capacity that involves the carrying and using of information about the world. But the significance of this point depends on exactly what we mean by a proposition, or by an item of infor- mation about the world. Human beings and other animals have diverse kinds of capacities and dispositions. The cognitive capacities are those that involve having and using information. The main point of Stanley's thesis, I take it, is that knowing-how, like knowing who, what, where, why and whether is a cognitive capacity in this sense. I think this is right, but exactly what it means depends on how we explain what items of information - things that are known - are. It is facts that are known (or so I was taught); Stanley identifies facts with true propositions. But what are propositions? Stanley opts for a neo-Fregean account according to which propositions are complex objects composed of modes of presentation. I don't think this is the best way to develop his intellectualist thesis (or as I prefer to call it, his anti-intellectualist thesis). He spends a chapter defending modes of presenta- tion against a number of criticisms, but I am not persuaded that he has made sense of them. Stanley's aim in chapter 4 of his book is "to demystify ways of thinking of things (i.e. modes of presentation)" (98). He gives three reasons that "appeal to ways of thinking have been thought to be problematic," and then responds to them. The first worry is that they are "ontologically mysterious entities"; the second is that they are "'conceived in sin' - the sin of confus- ing semantic questions with metasemantic questions"; the third is, roughly, that they are widely associated with a controversial claim in the philosophy of psychology, namely (to use David Lewis's appropriately disparaging term) language-of-thoughtism. I don't think any of these characterizations gets at the real problem. The third worry (about language-of-thoughtism) we can set aside. I agree that is an independent issue. On the first worry: I don't think ontological mysteriousness is a very well focused objection. I don't myself have a clear enough idea what modes of presentation might be to know whether they are ontologically mysterious or not. The second reason for finding mode of presentation problematic comes closest to one worry I have, but the problem is not that they are conceived in sin. I have no problem with ideas that have equivocation in their origin. (The 758 ROBERT STALNAKER</page><page sequence="6">"conceived in sin" metaphor of course alludes to Quine' s criticism of modal logic, where the sin was a use-mention confusion. Quine' s historical charge about modern modal logic - about its conception - was exactly right, but the theory overcame its disreputable origin.) The problem with modes of presentation is that the equivocation persists, and I think it persists in Stan- ley's characterization of them. The equivocation is between a constituent of propositional content on the one hand, and a relation between a thinker and the content of his or her thought on the other. Stanley is explicit in saying that modes of presentation, as he understands them, are "ways of hyposta- sizing our relations to objects in virtue of which we can think about them." But these "ways" are also constituents of the propositions themselves (and since facts are true propositions, according to Stanley, constituents of facts). I don't think anything can play both of these roles, since it is part of the idea of a proposition (an idea that was important to Frege, and that is important to Stanley's general thesis) that propositions, or Thoughts, be characterizations of the way the world is, characterizations that are intelligi- ble independently of thinkers that think the Thoughts, or speakers who assert them. It seems particularly implausible to hold that a fact has as constituents, relations to thinkers and speakers who think and talk about those facts. Now while the equivocation I am worried about may have been implicit in Frege' s, most of what he said about sense is clear and unproblematic if the sense of a name is taken to be a property that identifies the referent. The sense of "Aristotle", as used by one speaker, might be the property of being the last great philosopher of antiquity, in which case "Aristotle was fond of dogs" expresses the Thought that the last great philosopher of antiquity was fond of dogs - a proposition that might have been true if someone other than Aristotle had been the last great philosopher of antiquity, and had been fond of dogs. "Hesperus is Phosphorus" expresses a contingently true proposition, on this account, in virtue of the fact that it is contingent that the thing meet- ing the condition imposed by the sense of "Hesperus" is identical to the thing meeting the condition imposed by the sense of "Phosphorus". On this understanding of sense, which I think is faithful to most of what Frege says, it is clear what a mode of presentation is, and this account of modes of pre- sentation is compatible with the idea that a proposition is something indepen- dent of its relation to the thinkers who grasp or entertain them. That Hesperus is a planet is just a different fact (on this account) from the fact that Phosphorus is a planet. This kind of account of sense will provide all that Stanley needs to distinguish clearly between differences in the content of the information known and differences in an agent's capacity to deploy the information for some purpose, or in some way. And it is compatible with a coarse-grained conception of proposition that identifies them by their truth conditions (an account that Frege himself comes close to endorsing). BOOK SYMPOSIUM 759</page><page sequence="7">But while Frege' s notion of sense can be understood in this way, neo- Fregeans such as Gareth Evans, who Stanley cites, distance themselves from this interpretation. It seems that for Evans, the sense of a singular term is not a monadic property that picks out a referent, but a binary relation, presumably between the thinker or speaker entertaining the proposition and the referent. Let's look at Evans's account of the sense of the first person singular pronoun, which Stanley discusses with approval. The sense of T, according to Evans, is a three place relation between individuals S and S', and a time t. He says "Ri [the sense of T] is an as yet unspecified relation which can only be satisfied by a triple S, S' and t if S = S'." Let's ignore the time parameter, as both Evans and Stanley do in their discussions of this relation. So we are dealing with a binary relation between individuals that can be satisfied only if the individuals are identical. Any relation meeting this condition can be factored into two independent parts: the identity rela- tion conjoined with a monadic property. So Ri(S,S') is equivalent to (S = S')&amp;F(S), for some unspecified F. I have no idea what this unspecified monadic property F is supposed to be. But more generally, I don't under- stand how a binary relation can be a mode of presentation of an individual. What role is the relation playing in determining the truth conditions of the Thought expressed? The idea seems to be that one of the terms of the rela- tion is for the thinker or speaker, and the referent is the individual that stands in the binary relation to the thinker or speaker. This notion of sense is a clear departure from Frege in a number of ways. First, sense does not determine reference; at best, sense plus the thinker or speaker determines reference. But second, for Evans, the referent is an independent constituent of the Thought: when he spells out the sense of "I am hot" as said by Hume, he includes Hume in the proposition, along with the mysterious rela- tion Ri, which is presumably just the unmysterious identity relation. It seems that the sense (the identity relation) is playing no role in the truth conditions of the proposition expressed. Perhaps it was a mistake to put the referent into the proposition as an independent component, since the speaker or thinker, plus the sense, will determine the referent. So one might say that the referent is just the individual that stands in the mode-of-presentation relation to the thinker or speaker. This gives the sense a role to play, but it results in a theory according to which propositions are not true or false absolutely, but only true or false relative to persons and times. Assuming that Evansian modes of presentation are, in the general case, relations between the thinkers and the referents of their thought, the result would be that propositions in general are person and time dependent - a very unFre- gean conclusion. The issue about modes of presentation is not a side issue for Stanley's thesis, since as the dialectic of the discussion throughout the book brings out, the resistance to his thesis is based on presuppositions about what it is 760 ROBERT ST ALNAKER</page><page sequence="8">for knowledge to be propositional. As discussed above, I agree that the intellectualist presuppositions about the nature of propositions that many of the critics make are mistaken, but I also think that the thesis will lose its bite, and its point, if the notion of a proposition is watered down so that it no longer provides a clear distinction between cognitive states and capaci- ties - dispositional states with informational content - and dispositions more generally. At the end of his discussion of ways of thinking, Stanley says: "ways of thinking are characterized in terms of dispositions speakers have both to form beliefs about objects and to engage in various actions with respect to those objects." But on the Fregean view, they are also parts of what constitute the contents of the beliefs, and the items of information possessed by agents who know how to do things. I think it is important to the thesis (that knowing-how is a species of knowing-that) that we distin- guish questions about how we deploy our knowledge from questions about the content of the knowledge we are deploying, The notion of a way of thinking, as developed by the neo-Fregeans tends to obscure this distinction, and so to dilute the thesis that Stanley is defending.
