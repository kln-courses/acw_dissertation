<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN ACCOMMODATIONAL ESTHETIC Precursor for One Legitimate Black Esthetic in African Rock Art Traditions HENRY G. MICHAUX Lenoir, North Carolina ETHNOCENTRIC INTERPRETATIONS AFRICAN ART GENIUS The many styles, metaphorical slants, idiosyncratic morpho- logies, middle-of-the-road, back-to-Africa, social realism, or other artistic predilections of contemporary Afro artists have not fully exhausted one primal base for a legitimate foundation in the development of a Black esthetic African rock art. It appears that African rock art might be an esthetic as profound in its implications as any other: it deserves some attention. Intelligence-gathering associated with the African culture eventually runs into difficulty. This is due to, not only, a lack of consistency in the interpretations of what is found, but moreover, one certainly notices the frequency of occurence of the stigma of racial arrogance associated with the various interpretations. A contempt for blackness and the pursuit of knowledge about blackness remain unequally balanced. S omehow, a contempt for blackness has a perservering capacity of greater magnitude. For in earlier efforts to understand the works of West Africa, the art of Ife and Benin, for example, the contempt for native genius in African art was documented by Leo Frobenius whose judgment revealed gross specula- tions, suggesting that these quality works were due to the JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES, Vol. 8 No. 2, December 1977 i 1977 Sage Publications, Inc. [205]</page><page sequence="2">[206] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / DECEMBER 1977 impact of European or caucasian invention (yet another unfounded simplistic rationalization). Of course, subsequent explanations modified these false assertions-the scholarship of African history and the fact of an increased amount of research in Africa have steadily chipped away these ration- alizations, if only begrudgingly. And yet today, explanations of this sort still appear frequently in the literature of African rock art. However difficult or inconsistent the findings and interpretations, very few white writers acquiesced to a neutral position, taking the art of black Africa without the ethno- centric, paternalistic qualifications-of taking it at full face value. A point of intense controversy concerns the art of Spain and purported impact on African rock art. While a majority of writers hypothesized that Spanish rock art was older than North African rock art, thereby accounting for Spanish influences on the art of Africa, Frank Willet stated: it no longer seems likely that all these manifestations of rock painting and engraving in Europe and Africa are to be con- sidered either contemporaneous or even necessarily to repre- sent a cultural continuum stretching from eastern Spain to the Cape; nor is there any evidence that the art was spread from Europe southwards across Africa [Willet, 1971: 59]. A recent publication by Burchard Brentjes tends to support this position (with some qualifications) [Brentjes, 1970]. Any student of art history might ask how the experts referred to above explain Australian rock art and its similar relations to both Spanish and African forms. The main subject of conjecture is the polychromes from Algeria. Those works coming from the Jabberen Rock Shelter in Algeria, said to have been painted by nomadic herdsmen, are representations of what is generally known as the Cattle Period or Bovidian Period. Indeed, there is a strong resemblance to the works in the caves at Altamira in Spain (5000-1200 B. C.), but this alone does not offer conclusive evidence of Spanish influence. These</page><page sequence="3">Michaux / ACCOMMODATIONAL ESTHETIC [207] polychromes reveal the "naturalism" presumed to originate with European cultures. Moreover, one common attribute of both European and African naturalistic pieces is the artist's professional representation of animal movement; the natural procession is eidetic, sensitive to every twitch of muscle and the easy gate of a bovine family seeking greener pastures or a favorite water hole. The patterning has the natural design quality of an intelligence controlled by a primordial order- magic, perhaps-but, nevertheless, exceptional in the rhythms depicted. This might be sufficient for the cause of identifying and understanding quality works of so-called primitive cultures and primitive minds, if it were not for the deleterious implications of the tone and impact of covetous minds whose ethnocentric interpretations conspire to relegate blackness to a lesser-than status. This form of cultural empiricism is tantamount to the kind of racism Western art is guilty of. What is the meaning of all this? It appears evident that the concept of primitivism disallows any practice, technology, artistic understanding, or ways of perceiving comparable to nonprimitives. it also appars evident that ther term itself, sug- gestive and obviously abused, is the reason for the great dif- ficulty presented to ethnocentrically-biased experts. In having conveniently relegated these forms to a lesser-than status by assuming that civilized artistic behavior represents advanced development-i.e., artistic behavior utilizing naturalism as a means to an end-it then follows that arrested societies must not have developed naturalism and that the arbitrariness of the term primitive automatically disallows any form of natural- ism. This is hard to explain in light of discoveries at Lascaux (disputed heavily and labeled by some as fakes); in addi- tion, there appears little evidence that naturalism is given to the logic of chronological ordination that it takes so many hundreds of years to evolve a naturalistic mode, and that in the meantime, every graphic form must of necessity be undevelop- ed or free of any naturalism. Not having a way to reconcile these faulty assertions, and because they were unfamiliar with</page><page sequence="4">[208] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / DECEMBER 1977 or knowledgeable about other forms that were naturalistic, the encounters with geometrically stylized or decorative pen- chants in other cultures differentiated these works from their own, and the experts tended to assume a natural superiority of forms created by cro-magnon artists. By virtue of the fact that naturalism was absent, Western man assumed automatically this was a measure; this ignored the issue of whether the other cultures needed or desired a naturalistic form. Finally, when encountering naturalism produced by peoples previously assumed to be primitive or nonnaturalistic, a cover-up was initiated with the assertions that caucasoid types taught these so-called primitive artists. This tactic would provide face- saving security without having to admit error no self-respect- ing expert would admit such nonsense without explaining his own foibles along other lines as well a whole mythology, it seems. Questions have arisen as to what race produced cave paintings found in Tassili, Algeria (similar to those at Alta- mira), and the rock engravings discovered in the Accasus Mountain area, Fezzan, Libaya, where Henri L'hote suggested that the tradition of painting during the Cattle Period was in- troduced by herdsmen who brought cattle to the early hunters whose art was engraving. Some ethnographers and anthro- pologists (Breuil and L'hote, 1958; Kulin, 1950) felt that en- graving preceded actual painting.' This fact tends to shadow the interpretations from several points of view. In the main, when interpreting a life-size rock engraving of a rhino-said to have been done near the Accacus Moun- tains-with its absence of fluid strength of line alone, we are left with an interpretation that assumes that: (a) the execution reveals an inherent technical difficulty and should not be easily accomplished by scribing in stone, or (b) that the absence of fluid, lineal attributes accomplished by using methods of painting would suggest a work of lesser quality- the later view implying that engravings are elementary, preceding more advanced forms of painting. The rhino's</page><page sequence="5">Michaux / ACCOMMODATIONAL ESTHETIC [209] scale as an engraving is a tremendous task requiring very efficient tools and technology. This alone would suggest that either (a) technical attributes associated with execution are not appreciated and weighted by writers like Breuil, or (b) that there is a possibility these engravings require a different system of judgment, thereby allowing them to be produced contemporaneously with the paintings in other parts of south- ern Algeria. While studyingthe rhino engraving, one is amazed not so much by its technical or photographic quality, but by the surmisable attitude of the artist. The kinship of magic, emotion, and esthetic vigor seem very close indeed. Seen in this manner, engraving appears comparable to paintings. At times, it is difficult to separate one from the other. Both tend to display the fruits of minds at similar stages of development at work using different tools. Again, all one need only do is to pick up a sharp stone and write on a wall of stone to get a greater sense of the kinesthetic feeling charged through the experience. The engraving, as a translation of imagery, has a paramount motor logic-the medium tends to invigorate the execution, corresponding to the cerebral excitement. The work, in short, could have easily been born in the mind of the painter who painted the bulls in procession at the Jabbaren Rock Shelter or the cave paintings at Tassili in Algeria, by using the measure of excitement. Detracting from the inherent quality of the artist's behavior is the expert's comment. There are suggestions that as far as these rock drawings and their origins are concerned, variations in subject matter suggest common artistic heritage and dif- ferent religious ideas. Henri L'hote (see Brentjes, 1970) sug- gested that these were produced by a people of the white race "since an engraved plaque executed from the Capsian layer in Southern Tunisia shows a figure in a style resembling that of figures in Southern Oran, and the Capsian seems to have been developed by people related to the European Cro-Magnon type" (Willet, 1971: 55).2 If the morphology of the figure offers conclusive arguments based solely on evidence</page><page sequence="6">[210] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / DECEMBER 1977 of similarity, there is an inherent question as to the validity of the notion based on the questionable premise of similarity. For, certainly, there are similarities in art throughout the world, and one is not given much to work with solely on this kind of evidence alone. Are there peculiar racial and ethno- graphic properties given to the ancient people's art works? How certain is an assertion that Mediterranean art is more fluid and natural than the works of Oceanic or Benin art? How is it possible to detect racial origins in an area frequented by so many diverse peoples having so many diverse skills? Or is this part of the race game of attributing certain desirable properties of art to Caucasians and undesirable properties of art to peoples of color? Herbert J. Foster's (1974: 175) debunking of the Egyptian Hamitic or caucasoid myth cer- tainly points up the rules of an old race game whereby ancient religious and cultural myths associated with Black Africa, and its supposedly inherent inferiority in producing little or no quality culture, describes a situation where, when coveted or desirable cultural attributes are needed, Western man has endeavored to either change the racial origin of the people or find ways to demonstrate how white influences made the quality culture. An example of this difficult problem (as- cribing certain favorable attributes to caucasoid influences or origins) might be found in reference to rock paintings of giraffes at Wadi Kessan, Fezzan, Libya. These naturalistic renditions of three giraffes striding along in a lively gallop are to somehow represent art produced by European cro-magnon types. Whether the work's genius portends artistic excellence ascribable to the ability to convey naturalistic properties in figurative art or in the animation accompanying the portra- yals, many writers have not reconciled how the fact of similar attributes or even stylistic leanings in the works found in other peoples might somehow mute the effect of their as- sertions. One other important question in this controversy over caucasoid influences in Africa is about cro-magnon influences dipping as far south as to the Tsibab Ravine (found</page><page sequence="7">Michaux / ACCOMMODATIONAL ESTHETIC [211] in the Republic of Southern Africa) where Bushman rock paintings show the flying gallop ascribed to the Wadi Kessan giraffes in North Africa. If anything, these rock paintings demonstrate more of the flying gallop Frank Willet interprets as coming from Mediterranean influences. Abbe Breuil posited the theory of Cretan influence on Bushman rock art (Brentjes, 1970: 21). Burchard Brentjes, on the other hand, asks a very important question in alluding to his dis- agreement with Breuil, that as a result of all the varying other influences probably coming from the Mediterranean mariners, then where are the Mesopotamian, Sumerian, Assyrian, or Babylon influences on southwest African Bushman art (Brentjes, 1970: 21)? He continues by stating that some of these supposed Cretan contacts with Bushman rock paintings, where the Bushman supposedly makes an attempt at drawing the Cretan bell-shaped robes, is nothing more than the super- imposed drawings of Bantu kaross (skin cloak) over the recent antelope drawings completed by Bushmen. This question will not permit the Cretan myth to stand. But, as Willet would have us believe, when horsemen arrived from the East in 1200 B.C., they brought horses, chariots, and, more importantly, Cretan influences of graphic renderings of running figures where the figures are depicted with legs fully extended in a gliding or striding action. From the interpretations, then, black Africans are unable to execute this type of graphic art. The flying gallop concept has been utilized only within a closed set. While the Bushman example from Ladybrand (Williams, 1971: 96) poses no difficulty in ascribing the work, a quality in vigor in eidetic portrayals, there appear to be difficulties in reconciling the penchant for ethnocentric avowals of preferred artistic properties given to certain peoples who happened to be caucasoid.</page><page sequence="8">[212] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / DECEMBER 1977 BLACK AFRICAN ROCK ART OF THE PAST Is Roundhead rock art really a Black African thing? It appears evident that they were in the area longer than others. Andreas Lommel (1966: 143) estimates the origin of Round- head art to about 8000 B.C. (Brentjes' estimate is from Pre- dynastic to 3000 B.C.: 72), a figure estimated for earliest West African art examples. Lommel states further: It seems, however, from the scarifications indicated on the roundheaded figures (which resemble those raised on their skin by many West Africans today) and from obvious masks of Negro type associated with some of the figures, that this Negro people who may have migrated northward from Lake Chad, while the 'Europoid' features of the larger figures of the other type suggest an origin either in Mediterranean or in the Middle East [1966: 143]. Again, the disputation is evident in Lommel's assertion that the larger figures were produced by caucasoid types. Brentjes (1970) ascribes the larger works as belonging to the Roundhead Period, where in one cave there was a picture of a man 36 feet tall, outlined in red and sparsely filled in against a white background. Brentjes suggests that the origin of these large compositions might have stemmed from the deification of one of the great apes which occurred in West Africa to inspire fear or terror-but convinced that Roundhead de- piction of women adoring such giants credits the works to a Negroid stock. Another convincing argument centers around the White Lady of Auanrhet, dubbed after the White Lady of Brandberg cited by Abbe Breuil, where Negroid features are certainly evidenced in the Roundhead artist's depiction of a beautifully designed priestess. The strong belly, the hollowed loins, the breasts like goat's udders all suffice to prove her derivation from Negroid stock. So says Henri L'hote, the discoverer of these rock paintings (Brentjes, 1970). The anatomical proportions, especially the shape of the breasts,</page><page sequence="9">Michaux / ACCOMMODATIONAL ESTHETIC [213] the similarity of scarification designs to those of West African societies, all tend to impress one with the origin of the designs. Brentjes suggests that the White Lady of Auanrhet is one of the most beautiful and only known anthropomorphic example of the ritual veneration of cattle fertility. It is often presented in rock art as an ox with a disc, a pitcher, or something similar between the horns, which are found in drawings which are widespread between the Maghret and Upper Egypt (Brentjes, 1970; 1972). But the most important point is the work's exceptionally fluid grace and decorative merit. Being located in Tassili, Algeria, has very little to do with any caucasoid influence and is perfectly a black African thing artistically competent, eidetically sensitive, and free of racial stereotypes too frequently given to Black African's inability to execute naturalistic proportions. According to Brentjes, the second period following the Roundhead period credits the Fulbe (Fulani) society with some of the masterpieces of ancient painting skills in natural- istic portrayals. "Delicate renderings of young girls and above all one of what seems to be a bridal couple rank as great art" (Brentjes, 1970: 76). The fluid and graceful depiction of two girls in the Hieros Gamos pictures from Sefar (or those at Jabbaren, Tassili) presents conclusive evidence of the folly in the racial assumptions that black Africans are in- capable of naturalistic presentations. Somehow the effort of ethnocentrically biased researchers is blunted and remains suspect when evidence was uncovered by M. Lajoux, a photo- grapher in the Henri L'hote expedition, that the original rock drawings supposedly done in the Egyptian style and published by L'hote were indeed faked. That the works belonged to the Tassili in Algeria was, without doubt, further evidenced and thoroughly supported by Lajoux's 1960-1961 photo- graphic expedition where other animal drawings of high quality were found (Brentjes, 1970: 77). Roundhead rock paintings are easily distinguished as having anatomical parts where the heads appear in a near</page><page sequence="10">[214] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / DECEMBER 1977 perfect circular form-remindful of deep-sea diver's headgear. Figures at Tin Teferiest, Tassili are sometimes placed in the Archaic Period, as are other works dating back to and before the first millenium. Projected influences of this roundhead style might be found in northeast Yorubaland. At Eshure, Ekiti, one 42 inch stone figure retains the roundhead or spherical shape alluded to as particularly black African in origin. This barber-pole-like sculpture has not only raised scarifications indicative of an ancient rite having been prac- ticed many years before the development of the statue, but that these references pecked out in pointilistic concentration are found in the White Lady of Auanrhet and the figures at Tin Teferiest, Tassili as well. Ancestors of the Roundheads must be people who now inhabit forests and savannahs around the Gulf of Guinea (Brentjes, 1970: 71) and probably Senufo of the Ivory Coast because of the similarity of masks found there and those depicted in rock drawings at Auanrhet, Tassili (southern Algeria). Other descendants of this vanquished race of rock painters might be the Fulani (Fulbe) people of the upper Volta. They were the earlier herdsmen belonging to the pastoralist group. Descendants of the copper-skinned invaders were the Barber- speaking Tuaregs of the Sahara. They were the earlier chariot- eers whose influence might account for the advent of the supposed European naturalism. AFRICAN ROCK ART TRADITIONS TODAY What about subsequent periods encompassing West African art or an extension of the rock art traditions? Henri L'hote's chariot road was used as a graphic device depicting the breadth and character of the supposed North African influences. His chariot road is marked from Tripolitania, Tassi and Hoggar to Gao on the Niger-the single-shafted chariot from the West or Morocco and the double-shafted</page><page sequence="11">Michaux / ACCOMMODATIONAL ESTHETIC [215] chariot from the East. Is there evidence of a continuing influence from early rock forms into contemporary Africa? A pause with the Dogon might be revealing. The Dogon of Mali provide a kind of test case for arguments supporting or opposing the purported Caucasoid influences from the North. Being situated south of Algeria and west of the Niger puts Mali in the center of the target area. Firstly, rock paints from the walls of a circumcision grotto, in the village of Songo, can be studied so as to determine how the society's proximity to the supposed Europoid thrusts from the north is affected. Second, there are mythological, iconographi- cal, and esthetic considerations stemming from contemporary works of the Dogon peoples which are convenient in the analysis. How much of a naturalistic tradition is found in their current art? The origins for the current practices in circumcision rites seem to have stemmed from a very ancient source. It seems the first human birth brought an event of considerable signi- ficance in the art of the Dogon. The woman kneaded by Amma (mythological deity) had intercourse with the man without having been excised. Becoming pregnant and having twins (at the same time her pains were directed toward her clitoris, which fell off in the shape of a scorpion whose venom was composed of water and blood) provided the Dogon with a history of their circumcision rites; previously, her mate had been circumcised and his foreskin was transferred into nay, a kind of lizard (Laude, 1973: 27). This produced schemas with four limbs and upraised arms which are conventional iconographs for the Dogon. There is little reference, if any, to naturalism as a primary esthetic based on their mythology. The Dogon terracotta heritage provides an estimate of some of its traditional past. The first terracottas were found near the village of Kani Konboli, where traditions say that there were four Dogon families dating from the twelfth century (Arou, Ono, Dyon, and Domno). The dates of these terracottas suggest a development of a cultural form</page><page sequence="12">[216] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / DECEMBER 1977 before the Dogon arrived at the cliffs. A blacksmith artisan caste was supposed to have brought with it from Meroe and Nubia a cultural and technological change providing a bit of information as to what happened to these peoples. This then would suggest several influences coming to this West African people-possibly in waves-some African, and some non-African. Most of this is gravely speculative, at best. According to the work of Zahan and colleagues, 44 groups comprise the Mande language group, including the Dogon, of course, from the Atlantic coast, Senegal to Dahomey, as forming a common metaphysical foundation. Finally, upon inspection, it is found that the artisan caste system throughout these peoples is indeed diverse. Moreover, and here is the important point of cultural example, iconographic richness abounds-some notions common to the Dogon, Senufo, and Bambara alike may be found. Neither of the latter groups employ certain Dogon themes with great variety and com- plexity (Laude, 1973: 27). What would be the result of the cumulative impact of these several happenings? Simply that an esthetic of profound meaning to any Afro desirous of a serious consideration of his cultural origins and a fundamental search for artistic truth results. The following is considered representative of the present-day Dogon, as taken from the studies of Jean Laude. Aside the twinship-myth principle where the ideal unity sought by Amma was at first thwarted by his mate who, exerting her masculinity (she being bi-sexual as a result of the Dogon myth), was then later defeated to allow union. The Dogon myth has provided an esthetic base comparable to, yet possibly more profound than, any in Western art, for its esthetic is not a concept of lineal development, but an all-encompassing, simultaneously diverse mode. It can be naturalistic, geometric, and abstract it is a language. It is similar in morphology to the works of Picasso, Giacometti, and the German Expressionists. It is not primitive. It contri- butes to expanding and enriching of life of those for whom</page><page sequence="13">Michaux / ACCOMMODATIONAL ESTHETIC [217] it is created, its society. The society is neither primitive nor technological it is simply another alternative to human organization. Dogon art is exemplified in the celebrated story where the Kisi farmers of Guinea who, when plowing their fields, unearthed stone statues to be readily adopted to their own cults. They then interpreted them as manifesta- tions of their own ancestors. As with most Africans, the Dogon think directly with forms. In this way, oral myths arise from sculptural works. We might say that the relationship between the object and the myth is a dialectical one: items connected to the same mythic context interact with the proliferations of meanings attached to specific forms and combinations of forms. Each sculptor combines elements and forms in new ways and thus endows the myth with new depth; he discovers new aspects of its inex- haustible profundity [Laude, 1973: 26]. The Dogon do not symbolize thought but they stimulate it. The sculptures are then ideographs or signs and are manipu- lated by the sculptor by creating new combinations from which myth springs forth. Dogan art has no prerational knowledge of experience of form: "All forms are inscribed in a system that derives from a specific language-the language of art-but this particular language corresponds to a total language that constitutes society itself as a total fact" (Laude, 1973: 21). Is this then the result of the naturalistic influences of Europe? Is this comprehensive mode peculiarly African, Euro- pean, or Asian? Depending on what bias one has to offer and how far one might wish to delve into the matter, a bit of support can be mustered for either position. The dominating concern is the most critical one-that of the artist's relation- ship with his work, not even how he fosters his own personal individuality but the sacredness of his devotion to content in form, its autonomous nature as the precursor of meaning. This is a gigantic esthetic, devoid of petty arrogances of cultural supremacy. Artistic instrumentation is mostly divine in nature if the ineffable source of artistic genius can not</page><page sequence="14">[218] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / DECEMBER 1977 find any other reasonable base. This gigantic esthetic tends to, of itself, forsake petty aping of any precisely given formal property as, for example, those which might stem directly and emphatically from caucasoid origins. Its maturity is admira- ble, and again, denies itself of the convenience of being placed willy-nilly into traditional creative modes, which is too frequently given to interpretations of African art as a whole. This, then, would leave us with the bitter taste of a poisonous diet in cultural upsmanship where racial superiority is em- phasized and that a genuine esthetic stemming from a primal source, as with black Africans, is not possible and that the rock art of the Dogon represents a saving grace to all whose cultural consciousness has been too constantly bombarded by ethno- centrically biased humanistic studies. Combined with the extant examples of Dogon 3-D creations, Dogon rock art tends to deny any simplistic rationalizations about caucasoid naturalistic traditions. BUSHMAN ART: A TEACHER TO US ALL All African rock art has been classified into four periods, for lack of anything else to deal with, and generally compara- ble to the European indices of Hunting period (Bubalus Antiquus), Cattle period (Pastoralist), Horse period (which has three sub-periods identified as Chariot, Horse, Man, and Camel), and lastly, the Camel period completes the list of major periods (Laude, 1973: 43-50). C. K. Cook has a chrono- logy for south African rock art broken into four styles be- ginning about 4000 B.C. and ending with the coming of the Europeans (Lommel, 1966: 162). Its morphology is based on a continuum of spirited animism where first the figures of man and animals were stylized, and ending with progressively livelier depictions of animals and humans. The iconography and morphology has a progressive concept of quality improve- ment stamped onto each phase down to contemporary periods. There were, however, periods in which external</page><page sequence="15">Michaux / ACCOMMODATIONAL ESTHETIC [219] forces, or alien input systems, had varying kinds of effects on the works at least, as far as experts would have us be- lieve. Even though 17 styles have been found in certain areas of Bush art (Willet, 1971: 60-61), its peak was arrived at during the seventeenth century in what was called Pre- and Post-Bantu Periods. Abbe Breuil alleges the influence of Sumerians or Egyptians on the rock art of southeast Africa. Breuil's famous White Lady of Brandberg, alluded to before, was supposed to represent a figure with a Sumerian cloak, and is, as alluded to before, in fact a fringed karosses similar to those worn by mountain Bushmen and Basuto peoples (Willet, 1971: 60). The influence was attempted but it did not stick. The White Lady of Brandberg is similar in motif to much of Bush art in the striding, acutely persistent singlemindedness of the hunter. Depicted in the form of an elegantly costumed figure, one might assume a royal personage. The elegant limbs, the elongated physique, somehow defy a proximity to the shorter Bushman. Questions arise as to whether the work was done by Bantus or by the Bushman artist's depiction of Bantus a people supposedly enemies of the Bushman. The emphasis on animated grace, the abstracted and creative economy of form all stem from an esthetic born of passion and zeal. Most other works depict varying qualities of the stride. Even in place, there is an excitement born out of a subliminal creative drive to give life. It has been found that contemporary artists have a peculiar sense of motion that they sense it even in inanimate things. This action slant has contributed overwhelmingly to Bush art. If these interpreta- tions hold true, what could possess the Bushman artist to do these works if they and the Bantus were enemies or what about a cultural setting allowing for mutual respect and do- mestic tranquility between these peoples? On the other hand, why assume that the Bushmen did the works in the first place? As a result of the similarity between the White Lady of Auanrhet and the White Lady of Brandberg, experts tend to hold on to the belief that the Franco-Cantabrian influence of the Magdalenean period fell down on the Bushman. The sense</page><page sequence="16">[220] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / DECEMBER 1977 of design, linear precision, and anatomical dynamism con- tribute to both works, being classified as the most esthetic and dynamic and pleasing work of African rock art. As far as the tag white lady is concerned, it is only an inconvenience of sorts, for in some interpretations, these are not white ladies at all-just inconvenient tags. Peculiar to both is the existence of other influences which have lost their particular imprints. Peculiar to both is a sure sense of design, vigor, and references to a very meaningful myth system. Moreover, the power and impunity of the esthetic vigor is evident. "Even today, when the Bushman race has almost been exterminated, the mission- ary Mabille says that a Bantu proverb is still current: 'The Bushman is the teacher of us all"' (Brentjes, 1970: 6). There, then, was a respect for the Bushman and that some correspon- dence between the two peoples existed is evident. Important parallels might be found in the moral esthetic of Libyan or Rhodesian rock art with that of the Dogon. When- ever the Libyan or Rhodesian artists encountered drawings completed sometime before, i.e., depiction of hands (the former in negative patterns, 9?2 inches and the latter in positive patterns, 10 inches), there was an attempt of the artist to accommodate the drawings' primal or mythical worthiness by the addition of superimposed drawings, mainly of lineal or stick figure qualities. The result was a new relationship of sorts achieving an esthetic unity not to be easily corrected by subsequent additions by other artists who might happen that way. Like the Dogon, these works have a total accomoda- tional logic of taking to itself mythological, figural, or icono- graphical motifs of the precursor. In all instances, the striding, eidetic vigor of these works represents a total synthesis one not given to crass arrogance or egocenteredness requiring defacement, or more importantly, an effort to debunk them as being less important to the creations of their own. This superimpositional moral esthetic is Bushman logic. This is logic couched in a readily available will to accommodate the natural order of things, to foster a creative accommodational mode or to maintain a profound respect for spiritual forms</page><page sequence="17">Michaux / ACCOMMODATIONAL ESTHETIC [221] coming from the past. The Bushman could teach Western man as well. To the Bushman and the Dogon, on the other hand, the forthrightness of an esthetic of immediacy dominate; the Dogon might utilize the precursor's myth as his own, and the Bushman respects the magic of the precursor who came before him by not defacing or erasing the spirits trapped within each work. Energy levels are given to the immediacy of state- ment and not a separative perception born to arrogance and given to arguments of race, cultural hierarchies, or idiosyn- cratic upsmanship. This moral esthetic might be further exemplified at the Mtoko Cave in Rhodesia, where many artists and many generations of artists are said to be responsible for the gi- gantic graffiti found there. This display of sign and symbol, man and beast, entrap and bestow esthetic sensitivities at once comparable and, second, separate to a single ethos, a behavior, even a cryptic record of creative mannerisms given to a concerted plastic mode, not in the least bit disharmonious, but emphatically suggestive of a single artist, a race, or a culture. Here, we have Bradley Tomlin, Mark Tobey, Jackson Pollock, Jake Lawrence, Charles White, and Ibrahim Salahi, or Twins-Seven-Seven rolled up into one. There is very little room for a picayune dialecticism. This is a universal artistic mode. Elemental simplicity reigns paramount in Bush art. These child-like qualities could be totemistic, mythological, iconographic, animistic, or whatever. In any event, they are inclusive of meaning, thought to be of profound significance to the artists. Whether they adopted previous designs out of respect for signs per se, or by utilizing and retaining those of some personal meaning, the fact remains that no avenue is cut off from the Bushman's imagination. The cave art at Mtoko is typical of a community effort. With figures smaller than scale to those at Lascaux and Altamira, the compositional range of 23.5 feet dominates the mind as a serial of tribal happenings of significant magnitude. This scene included a reference to signs unknown in content but organizationally apt. Symbol, sign, and myth are indeed</page><page sequence="18">[222] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / DECEMBER 1977 parts and parcels of the same bag, but, unfortunately, nine- teenth century efforts to understand Bush myth were lost to disinterest or complexity. Moreover, the resulting graphic effects are at least esthetically profound. Huts, cattle pens, or animal-headed figures (ancestor spirits of death) somehow have the delicate balance and compositional order unmatched in sensitivity. COMPARATIVE ESTHETIC OTHER AFRICAN NOTIONS Another avenue of our concern lies within the area of comparative esthetics. Extending analyses into the contem- porary arena might provide more information about an indi- genous African esthetic, and especially related to rock art. Contemporary esthetics found in other African cultures either reveal similarities to the Bushman and Dogon alike, or in- herent differences. However, contemporary esthetics in other cultures do not suggest that the cultural behavior alluded to has been cut off from its recent past-only the contrary! That a comprehensive base is possible, there is no doubt, for this is a result of a continuing tradition, augmented by a contemporary setting, the immediate perceptions of the artists, or their relation to the creative object. Comparative esthetics of the Tiv artists of central Nigeria have been attempted. Creativity, as used in our jargon, is associated with the majesty of God's original creation, and as far as the Tiv artist is concerned, is not referenced, for the artist is interested only in the result of creativity or the object itself (Fraser, 1966: 247). "Tiv are more interested in the ideas conveyed by a piece of art than they are in its manufacture, just as in their religion they are far more inter- ested in the Creation than the Creator" (1966: 248). Not only does this parallel the Dogon, but applies to the supposed magical purposes of Bush art. The thing has a primary pur- pose-an autonomous property given by the creator whose role is secondary; and all of this is to the service and majesty</page><page sequence="19">Michaux / ACCOMMODATIONAL ESTHETIC [223] of the statement itself. This might be described in Western terms according to the dictum art-for-art's-sake, or other misgivings when implicit values are placed on the final pro- duct. This esthetic is not given to infantile babblings of un- sophisticated beings who seem to be driven by forces they do not understand. These choices, of course, are available to anyone, depending upon his state of mind or purposes. Realistically and contrary to popular beliefs, these artists have demonstrated esthetic choices of varying kinds and degrees, as evidenced in contemporary studies of the Bakwele (Child and Siroto, 1971: 271) and Dogon alike. The phrase ethnographical union of man's mind resurfaces from the works of Herbert Read to signify that no one really is different after all-that similarity between cultural creations might be connected to a tenuous genealogical line of universal signi- ficance. Ibrahim Salahi, head of the School of Fine Arts at the University of Khartoum in the Sudanese Republic, was asked if he gained anything from the Slade School of Art in London. His answer was in the negative. The artist continued to say: I find when I am working certain words come to me. I usually feel nervous, almost like a chicken trying to lay an egg, when I have an idea. And then suddenly I have words that come to me; then I start chasing them, I start repeating them, humming, and then sometimes some of them appear on the work itself. I find I've done them without realizing it. Their meaning is prayer mostly. Some of it is poetry; some of it is directly from the Koran, and some of it is just things which come into my head which have no meaning at all, just words put together. And then they seem to come through me and appear on canvas [Duerden, 1970: 25]. Not unlike Mark Tobey or Bradley Tomlin, the American artists who took interest in the word sign, this artist has grappled with signs and symbols through Arabic characters. Unlike the American examples, his religion catalyzes his</page><page sequence="20">[224] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / DECEMBER 1977 artistic zeal. The written sign follows the same contemplative mysticism of Japanese calligraphy and ancient screen painting or devotion to Bushito. Moreover, the similarity between Salahi, Tobey, Tomlin, and Kline is through a release system of allowing a subliminal surfacing of felt and unknown sense states. The Bushmen's contemplative vigor enters the arena in the same fashion through certain needs for personal survival and the maintenance of his myth system. Salahi's The Woman, the Bird and the Pomegranate has the mark of Western- design morphology. This, however, may be only incidental. For the figural quality is imbued by the esoteric-the sur- real-the mythical-the sign, symbol, denatured syntax, but more often than not, the African sense of vigorous imagination couched in fraternal kinesthesia. Probably one of the most talented contemporary painters in Africa is Twins-Seven-Seven. This artist does not have the formal art background of Salahi. His training has not destroyed his freshness in interpreting Nigerian myths. The basis of his art is his belief in local myths. Like Salahi, he retains much of the temporal rhythms of his forefathers. His King Cock in Ibembe Forest is not a denial of heritage but a covetous use of it to develop a continuous creative genesis. His moral commitment to these virtues may be revealed in the devotion of the Bushmen to an accommodational esthetic. The Dogon appear the same. His style is his own. His visions are as paramount as the visions captured on rocks in Draken- berg, southwest Africa over 300 years ago. Skunder Boghossian of Ethiopa studied art in London and has had shows in New York, Paris, and Munich. His tech- nology is the technology of contemporary artists. His visions are rare; his design is superb. His mind-scapes reveal imagery cauterized by contemporary technique. His memory is fantas- tic evoking shadowy reflections of another time part cerebral and part animistic. Jimo Akolo of Nigeria studied at the University of Indiana. His genre in Man Hanging from Tree is the kind of stylism alluded to before in Dogon and Bush art behaviors. His bold designs are communicative and</page><page sequence="21">Michaux / ACCOMMODATIONAL ESTHETIC [225] have referrals to taboos, superstitions, and black magic (if one allows himself to get caught up in its coding of deathly color tones, lifeless visages, and symbols). Each of these artists (those unknown rock artists included) in his own way represents much of what might be basic in a real black esthetic. Common to all is a belief system. A system of referrals to one's personal reflections, one's psychic state, sensuous immediacy, passions, needs; a system of referrals heightened by a need to preserve heritage, even if modified to fit one's current needs; a referral system of creative flexi- bilities to forsake crass arrogance, esthetic bias, racial snob- bery, and, most important of all, a criterion esthetic basic to the end product itself-it alone must exist as a testimony to autonomous virtue. The work must speak with a vigor all of its own. Finally, the accommodational esthetic of the African rock art genius might be summed up with another artist, a poet by the name of Christopher Okigbo, who died in 1967 fighting for Biafra. He summarized what might be identified as a basis for genuine black esthetic. His metaphor is applicable to con- temporary Afro-American, Black African, or even non-black esthetic standards: All I did was to create the drums and the drums said what they liked. Personally I don't believe that I am capable of saying what the drums have said. It's only the long funeral drums that are capable of saying it, and they are capable of saying it only at that moment. So I don't think I can claim to have written the poem; all I did was to cover the drums, and to create the situation in which the drums spoke what they spoke. I think all we hear nowadays of men-of-two-worlds is a lot of nonsense. I belong, integrally, to my own society, just as, I believe, I belong also integrally to other societies than my own. The truth is that the modern African is no longer a product of an entirely indigenous culture. The modern sensi- bility, which the modern African poet is trying to express, is by its very nature complex; and it has complex values, some of which are indigenous, some exotic, some traditional, some modern. Some of these values are Christian, some non-</page><page sequence="22">[226] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / DECEMBER 1977 Christian, and I think that anybody who thinks it is possible to express consistently only one line of values, indigenous or exotic, is probably being artificial [Duerden, 1970: 25]. I think Mr. Okigbo speaks precisely to the indigenous artistry of Afro-American musical traditions-an art of undisputed clarity pointing up a genuine black esthetic. NOTES 1.
