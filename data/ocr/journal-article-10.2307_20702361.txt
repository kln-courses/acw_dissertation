<plain_text><page sequence="1">95 MAORI MATERIAL IN THE VIENNA MUSEUM. By Raymond Firth. TN the December issue of the Journal appear reproductions -*? of two Maori bone chests which form part of the Reischek collection in the Naturhistorische Museum in Vienna, in reference to which a few notes may be of interest. The illustrations of the chests, forwarded by Mr. W. J. Phillipps, who received them from Dr. R. T. Bleichsteiner, are appar ently from photographs which Dr. Bleichsteiner was kind enough to have made for me when I visited the Museum in 1926. Through his courtesy I was enabled to examine the collection in detail. The chest which is represented as fig. 1 in the Journal (no. 42,623) is in a better state of preservation than its fellow, though the carving on both is much eroded in places. That of fig. 2 (no. 42,624) has been practically effaced by decay, a little on the face of the anthropomorphic figure alone remaining, while the legs which it appears once to have possessed have disappeared. The wooden slab which would normally be attached at the back to complete such a chest is missing from the first example ; in the case of the second it exists, and is roughly attached by ties of vine and Phormium passed through three pairs of holes, thus forming a hinge. This chest contains the bones of at least two individuals, including humeri, tibiae, two pelves, and a few ribs. The exact provenance of either specimen is not stated in the catalogue; Reischek, not the least of whose virtues was his zeal as a collector, perhaps did not wish to give too precise information about the locality from which he obtained them. The note accompanying the specimens is none too definite : they are Ngapuhi, " from a hole in the north part of the North Island." The existence of these specimens in the Vienna collection has been noted previously, as by W. T. Brigham, who refers</page><page sequence="2">96 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY. to the " Ancient coffin ; a hollow log with the end carved in form of a human head: filled with cleaned bones."1 Another item of considerable interest is the body of an adult Maori with much of the flesh still preserved on the bones, as shown in fig. 1. The process has evidently been one of desiccation, not true mummification, and the posture, with knees drawn up and hands folded on the chest, is that in which a corpse was commonly trussed by the Maori prior to interment or concealment. Subsequent to the wasting away of flesh from the legs, the bones have been tied together 'with pieces of Phormium. The flesh and skin of the front of the body hangs in strips, and is of the consistency of dry bark; that of the back is in a better state of preservation. The height of the figure, thus crouching, is 85cm.; I did not determine the sex. Asso ciated with this specimen is another of similar type, but of a small child, 27.5 cm. long ; this is described as " a Maori baby mummy, limestone formation?Kawhia, April, 1882. Collector, A. Reischek, N.Z." while a further note adds that it was obtained from a hole in the limestone (eine kalkstein H?hle). The body of the adult was obtained from the same situation. According to the account of Reischek (Sterbende Welt, 174-175) he wras guided by natives?who forswore national and religious principles for money?to a limestone cave; there he found four mummies, two in good preservation. He took these by night, transporting them by short stages until they were safely over the border of the King Country. Elsewhere he observes that the tapu of such caves is " indissoluable " ; anyone who disregards it is slain?which did not seem to deter him in his project! He also records that he was told by natives of a former custom of mummifying the bodies of high chiefs by a process of sun-drying. This, however, had not been done with the specimens he obtained. These are of some importance in 1 Brigham, . P. Bishop Museum Occasional Papers, 1898, 1, 9. In Sterbende Welt (1924, p. 84) Reischek describes how, on entering a deserted hut in Marikuru pa (" Marekura " in the MS. note), Northern Wairoa,. he found two decaying carved "coffins" (S?rge), as well as a carved figure said by him to represent the chief Tirorau, which he removed (v. infra.). It is probable that the bone chests in the Vienna Museum were obtained during Reischek's visit to this northern district, rather than from the King Country, as stated in the Polynesian Journal, 1927, p. 84.</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 1.

Skinner did much to clarify. Such mummification was usually not pre meditated, but simply the result of placing the body in some crevice where the natural agents of water and calcium carbonate happened to be particularly free to act in pre serving the flesh. The Naturhistorische Museum possesses a considerable quantity of other Maori material in addition, mostly from the Reischek collection, but, as Mr. H. G. Beasley has also noted,3 the bulk of the specimens are not of very high quality, though some are of considerable value. Their interest is perhaps rather historical than ethnograhpical, consisting in the fact that many of them came into the collector's hands from important men of rank in the King Country. The collection includes the following specimens?the figure in brackets following each heading indicates the num ber of each; remarks quoted are those of Reischek, with his original spelling of native names. Weapons. Taiaha (10)?One example, 178 cm. long, is ornamented with kaka feathers and dogs' hair. " From the chief Mania poto, the principal of the Maniapoto tribe, Kotukotuko, Mokau, 1882." Another, 161 cm. in length, was obtained from Potatau at Hikurangi in 1882. All the weapons of this type are of good workmanship. Tewhatewha (8)?A specimen, 137 cm. in length, hung with a tuft of hawk's feathers and the former property of " Whitiora te Nakau," was obtained at Whatiwhatihoe in 1882 ; another, 130 cm. long, with tufts of hair of the Maori dog, came from the Whanganui district in 1886, while a third, carved on the shaft, and with the name Kourenui on the blade, was labelled as from " Dr. F. Hochstetten 1859." Spears (4)?Two, 217 cm. and 220 cm. long respectively, of a light wood, are from the Whanganui River; a third, 160 cm. long, apparently of manuka, was obtained from 2 J.P.S. 25, 123, 167-172; 26, 70-74, 98, 188-9. 3 J.P.S. 36, 84, 1927.</page><page sequence="6">98 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY. the chief Tanikera at Hikurangi in 1882. Another example, described as a " matia, fish spear,"* consists of a wooden shaft with the barbed point of a sting-ray lashed on with Phormium. The shaft had been grooved previously for another point, perhaps a bayonet. This specimen, suggestive of the common flatfish-spear, was obtained from " Ngahoni chief, Kaipara." In addition, there are three other curious objects to which the name of " Tauwhenui "f is assigned. These are each 140 cm. long, with one end pointed and round in cross-section, the other blunt and square in section. Des cribed as a " carved spear, with which they pierce (stecken) and with the four-cornered end strike (schlagen) " they were obtained from the chief Honana, of Te Kopua, in 1882. They are carved all over the surface in that unrestrained style characteristic of modern Maori work, and do not appear to represent an ancient type of weapon, perhaps being merely the product of some craftsman's whim. Hoeroa (1)?A good specimen of this comparatively rare type of weapon, it is of a brownish-yellow whalebone, 152 cm. long, carved at the base, and for a few inches on both edges toward the middle. It bears initials W. P. G. and the inscription : " only made in olden times by Ngapuhi tribe, this weapon Ngati Mahuta tribe captured in battle with the above-named tribe. King Tawhiao is the possessor, Whatiwhatihoi,$ 1882." Patu onewa (6) from various localities?A specimen of unusual shape is apparently made from a basalt adze blade, has no hole in the butt, while two small lugs on the sides of the haft spread to form a check to the grip. The haft and cutting edge are somewhat rough. Another of these weapons of more ordinary type, 37 cm. long, is stated to have been in the possession of twelve chiefs. Their names are given as : " Tehio Rai, Hanauru, Tumoke, Tamati Haia, Te Awa, Kura, Hona te Ao, Kohapo, Tawhiao, Riterangi, Manuhiri, Ponokoru, Uetawhiti. Last possessor, Whitiora te Nakau, Ngati Mahuta tribe, Hikurangi, 1882."

Three more are of whalebone, one being from Hauturu settlement, and seven, mostly poor examples, are of wood, one of the latter, of the type commonly termed wahaika, being " a finely carved weapon which Potato,f the first king, bore; from King Tawhiao." Two mere pounamu of usual form are of fairly modern workmanship. The collection also includes a model mere in kauri gum, which seems to be highly valued by the Museum authorities. Technical Appliances and Accessories. Digging Implements (9), including a ko about 7 feet long with carved wooden tread and carved top, three short implements of the pinaki type, and an old, somewhat broken specimen suggestive of a trowel! Bird-perch for snare (1) of plain workmanship, and poria, leg ring (1). Fish-hooks (27), including five large barbless wooden specimens for catching shark, three barbed wooden hooks, six of composite type, haliotis-shell and wood, a small bone specimen, and several of iron, as well as eight bone shanks. There are also eight sinkers. Pounders (12)?Nine of stone (two being from Hoch stetter, 1859), and three of wood. Tattooing Instruments (6)?Hafted, from Ngati Ma huta, with three strikers and a small box of black pigment. Fire-apparatus?Two pair of fire-sticks, new, and a carved model of human figures producing fire. Stone Tools include in one division of the collection forty-one polished adzes and six roughly chipped, of grey wacke and other material, and eighteen adzes of greenstone, one of which, over a foot long, is a fine specimen, with traces of red ochre clinging to the base and edge. In addition to a hafted chisel and four hafted adzes with modern binding there is a large series of stone flakes and several grinding * Probably powhatu (stone) : many of the spellings throughout are dubious ; the Teutonic ear did not always detect the nuances.?Ed. f The first king was not the regal tuber : Potatau is intended.?Ed.</page><page sequence="8">100 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY. stones, as well as a cord drill with wooden crosspieces for balance and a sharp point of flint. The efficacy of this implement was proved by experiment. Of minor interest is a subsidiary series of seventy-nine adzes together with a large number of stone and obsidian flakes, bones of moa, man, and the Maori dog. Gourds (2) from Whanganui, also two half-gourds with incised ornamentation, and two bark containers. Trinket-boxes (2)?One oval, 42 cm. long, termed " papa-raukura." " This piece was long in the possession of Ngati-Mahuta tribe and was handed down from chief to chief. The name of the first was Te Taupo, then Tauteka, Te Heuheu, Te Hiwikau, Tawhiao, and Whitiora te Nakau. Hikurangi, King Country."4 Lintels (3)?One (no. 7,878) well carved, another old and much battered, and the third of modern workmanship. Gable-ornaments and other carved figures (12), includ ing a figure 97 cm. high of an old cannibal, Tirorau, of Northern Wairoa, tattooed* from Marekura pa, Ngapuhi; also a head 27 cm. in height, from the runanga of the well-known chief Patara Te Tuhi of Ngati Mahuta. Canoe-ornaments?Stern-pieces (3) including the speci men illustrated in fig. 2. Prows (7) are of no great interest, three of the fretted type and the others of the simpler style of head with outstretched neck. The collection includes also two model canoes and the prow of a third. Balers (4), including the interesting specimen, fig. 3, round the interior of which is incised "KO TE KAUAE O TE P?KA." Flutes (8)?These comprise a putorino of plain work manship, bound with vine, and two other modern specimens of the same type ; three koauau of wood, one being tastefully carved ; one of bird bone and another of human arm bone. The latter is carved at both ends and is much perforated, having, in addition to three holes open for playing, five plugged on one side and two more on the other. 4 Sterbende Welt, p. 189.</page><page sequence="9">Maori Material in the Vienna Museum. 101 Personal Ornaments. Plumes?These comprise several heads of /iuta, and tufts of tail-feathers of this bird received as gifts from prominent chiefs such as Tawhiao (eleven feathers), Waha nui, Whitiora te Ngakau, uncle of the king, Hemera Rirehau (nine feathers), and Honana te Maioha; also an albatross feather tuft from Wiwini at Te Piha, and a small feather covered twig. Pendants comprise twelve tiki, mainly good examples, including four with toggle still attached ; two ornaments of hei matau type, one pekapeka, and thirty-two simple ear pendants, mostly of poor workmanship. These are all of greenstone. In addition there are four shark-tooth pendants and several bone needles of the type used as cloak-fasteners. Combs (4)?Two are of wood, one being broken, and two of bone, apparently old, one being of good workmanship. Plaited Material. Belts (3), Floor Mats (2), Garments (24) ?These latter include a rain-cape of black and yellow tags, a cloak with taniko borders and decoration of tufts of red feathers, several korotvai, two kahu kiwi, &amp; cloak with mixed feather wool decoration from " Te Uriohau tribe, Manakau," and a dog-skin cloak (" hururiko "). This garment, 99 cm. by 117 cm., is white in colour with a border of brown fringed again by white, and a further edging in which one compound is red wool. It is noted as " the last mat of its kind among the savages of the King Country." Other Objects. Other objects are kits (23), swag straps (4 sets), and a food-dish. Most of this material is from the Urewera and Ngati-Mahuta people. The collection also includes a miscellaneous assortment of flax cords purporting to be path-signs, each tribe, accord ing to the collector, having its own, which were used when the way was not clear. In addition there is a message-cord with a simple loose knot, which is of the type sent as a token from man to maiden. This last was obtained from Honana te Maioha, who was a particular friend of Reischek,</page><page sequence="10">102 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY. Not all of the material mentioned above is on display in the Museum cases, but owing to the facilities provided by Dr. Bleichsteiner, I was able to examine the Maori reserve collection also, and include its contents in my list. To him, moreover, I am indebted for his kindness in arranging for the specimens here illustrated and others to be photographed for me, while I owe much to the hospitality of Dr. Andreas Reischek, son of the naturalist, during my stay in Vienna. These notes, while making no pretence at offering an adequate study of the material, may be of interest as a record of a collection of Maori artifacts made nearly half a century ago by an interesting personality, and may perhaps be of some service to the future students of our native material culture.</page></plain_text>
