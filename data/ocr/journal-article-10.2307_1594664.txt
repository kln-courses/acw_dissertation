McKENZIE (University of Leicester, U.K.) YORUBA Orish cults have been receiving attention for a long time now, both singly, and together in more general treatments of Yoruba religion. 2 But many questions remain. For example: census figures may give an approximate number of non-Christians and non-Muslims in Western Nigeria, 3 but the number of dris&amp; cult-groups at any given point in time has never, as far as I know, been ascertained, except in the case of certain towns and cities. 4 Another question, of some significance, concerns the way the brisa -the Deities-relate to one another in the context of an overall reli- gious cosmology. Much controversy has been aroused over the question of the Supreme Deity, 5 rather less over the status and interrelationship * Note on Orthography.

Acknowledgement is gladly made of assistance given in the preliminary stages by the Research Board of the University of Leicester. 2 Noteworthy examples of these include Leo Frobenius' Die atlantische G6tter- lehre (Jena: E. Diederichs 1926) and The voice of Africa (London: Hutchison I913), and W. R.

D. O. Epega (The basis of Yoruba religion, Ebutemetta, Nigeria: Ijamido Publishers 1971) lists more than sixty. Winm. Bascom (The Yoruba of Southwestern Nigeria, New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston 1969), estimates the number of "white" deities and hill deities alone at more than a hundred. 5 Apart from the standard work of E. B. Idowu, Ol6ddimare: God in Yoruba belief (London: Longman 1962), mention should be made of C. H. Long's The West African high god: history and religious experience, History of Religion 3, 1963-64, 328-342; Pierre Verger, The Yoruba high god - a review of the sources, Odu 2, 1966, 19-4o; and Robin Horton, Conference: 'The high god in Africa', idem, 87-95.

Just as people have been content to give a notional answer to the question of the number of riSsa-201, 4o01 and so on-so too, we have tended to be content with some convenient model of the Yoruba religious cosmology which grouped the 6risa cults together in some kind of ordered way. Three kinds of model have assumed some degree of prominence. The first one, and by far the most popular and long-standing-one to which I myself adhered for some years-was roughly triangular in shape. The 6rissh occupied much of the space within the triangle, graded according to their importance and power. Below them were the imahlk, the spirits, many of whom were unpredictable and dangerous. Above the risah was Ol6run-Ol6ddiimare, the Supreme Deity, whose 'ministers' the %risI were, 6 and whose delegated power they deployed as mediators between God and mankind. A second model, outlined by Morton-Wil- liams, to some extent in reaction to the first one, 7 was more circular or spherical in shape. In the upper hemisphere the scenario was little changed: Ol6run-Ol6ddiimarei was still above the greater and lesser orisa. But there were two important modifications: two of the obrish, Ifi and f'sii, were placed in a special position to one side; and below the 6ris.'s was a group of cults more closely related to the earth spirit. These formed the earthly counterpart to the sky deities and Supreme Deity. On the surface it all looks like some kind of Iranian dualism, and it has, in fact, been likened to the latter, but I do not think the author of this model saw the same kind of radical opposition in Yoruba religion at all. Morton-\Villiams believed that the revised model accorded better with the cosmology implicit in the praise songs (oriki), chants and prayers of the ortisa cults themselves, though he did not attempt to substantiate this claim in detail. s Some years previously, however, Pierre Verger, a French scholar, had taken the trouble to collect and publish what is still perhaps the largest single collection of these oriki and chants. 9 Reflecting on this first-hand material, Verger concluded that the various 6rissh were separate deities in the full sense, juxtaposed 6 E.

Each of the three models outlined has advantages and disadvantages. The first is strong in terms of the unity and continuity of divine power, something which is certainly felt in Yoruba religion. Moreover it caters for the 'macrocosm' as well as the 'microcosm', to use terms made popular by Robin Horton some years back. 12 There is the strong tendency in this model to take account of theological speculation within the cult-groups in the direction of a more rationalised universalist monotheism. More importantly, for our purpose, it sometimes appears to have the effect of jeopardising the integrity of the individual brish cults by narrowing the true profile of attributes of the bris.t themselves. 13 Thus the microcosm may be sacrificed too much to the interests of the macrocosm. Morton-Williams' revision goes some distance towards correcting the imbalance. It restores an independent position to Onile, the earth goddess, whose cult may well have antedated those of the broisa associated with the sky. It also recognizes the special position of IAsit and Ifa for members of all the cult groups. However it is probably true to say that the 'sky' &amp;riah, e.g. Ogitn and even S~ng6, have also strong links with the earth.14 Verger would doubtless say that all the 3risa cults are really earth cults. 15 Also, If'a and E'siu are not the only brish that offer services to members of other cult-groups. 10 Ibid., p. ii, and Verger, The Yoruba high god... (1966), p. 24. 11 Verger, Notes sur le culte ...

It is not the case, thus, that Ogi'n is simply a "god of iron and war". He is also a god of fertility and the earth. Similarly with respect to their sub- ordination to O16run-O16diimari. We find, as early as 1848, that followers of Idagbe (Dangbe) near Badagry hasten to assure the Sierra Leonian William Marsh, who has reproached them concerning the 'vanity' of worshipping 'idols', that their intention was 'to worship the Almighty God through Idagbe' (CMS CA2/o67 W. Marsh, Jnl. Q.E. 25.9.1848). 14 Ogrin, for instance, is called Master of the World and Owner of the Earth (Oris Onilei) in an Ishidi chant (Verger, Notes sur le culte, 196-198). The 'active' brtiv; clearly tend to accumulate attributes. 15 P. Verger, The Yoruba high god... (1966), pp. 34f.</page><page sequence="4">192 P. R. McKenzie S~ng6, 0giin and other brist do the same. 16 Apart from these specific features, one has the feeling that the second model is almost as tightly enclosed as the first one. Verger's loose juxtaposition of different cult-groups, linked by the common belief in the power of medicinal substances conveying ask, is attractive in a number of ways: it at least gives the ris~h cults an independent status. Perhaps it over-values the importance of ask, though this does form apparently a widespread feature of the Yoruba cults. 17 Perhaps, too, it under-values the inter-relatedness of the cults and the specialization of particular cult-groups, such as Ifi and Isii. But it has the merit of providing a useful base-line for following up the suggestion put forward by Morton-Williams: namely, to look at the extent to which the oriki and chants of drigsa cults support a given cosmological model: in particular, how often they mention other drisa as well, and also O16run-Ol6duimare, the Supreme Deity, or Onilk, the earth goddess. The assumption is that these oriki and chants are speaking of what is important to the members of the particular 3risa tradition concerned. Or--to use the German proverb-Wes' das Herz voll ist, des' geht der Mund iTber. 18 If the answer should be strongly positive, this should tend to argue for a more unified cosmological model of the triangular of circular pattern. If not, then we shall have to think in terms of Verger's or some variant of this. I should like to begin with a brief reference to my own-admittedly limited-experience in 1972 and 1975 of cult celebrations of Sing6 and Onile, two &amp;risa associated with the sky and earth respectively. 19 (Further contacts with the cult-groups of Eguinguin, Orils-Oko and Ok&amp;-Oriri, Hill Divinity at Iwo, 20 do not alter the general picture 16 .Sng6 priests are concerned with all places struck by lightning; Ogrin's importance in war becomes infinite; and Frobenius discerned long ago the funda- mental importance for all 3riesd cult members of Osanyin, the 0riSh of healing with medicinal leaves. 17 One of $Sng6's praise names is "leaves are profitable indeed" (D. A. Adeniji and P. R. McKenzie, Funeral Rite of a Samng6 Priestess (manuscript), Chant 28c). 18 It was pointed out in discussion that the oriki, being traditional in form, may not represent the present beliefs of the oldris4i; but this does not detract from their normative character for the cult-group as such. The advantage of the oriki and chants over other statements by the people about their cosmology is that the oriki, being traditional 'survivals' from an earlier day are less affected by the pressures of the macrocosm. 19 D.

At the time, and afterwards as I studied the text of the oriki and chants, it became plain that Sing6 was himself the object of devotion in his own right, and that Onilk was equally the object of devotion in her cult-group as well. No other &amp;ris&amp; received attention to any great extent. In the case of the S~ng6 festivals, there were references, as we might expect, to Ifa and Ish. There was a comparison of Sing6's power with that of Ogrin, and at the end of one of the festivals, there was an oriki to Yemoja, the goddess of waters, in mythology the mother of Sing6. The purpose of this was, doubtless, to define S~ng6's place in the Urzeit, and to exert a "cooling" effect on rituals which might tend to get dangerously overheated with a "hard" or "hot" deity like S.ng6. There was however no reference at all to Ol6duimare or to Onile. In the case of the Ogboni ritual, the theme throughout was simply "Hail to the Earth Deity (HPkepea Malel)". There were brief references to Ogrin, S.ing6, S6ponna and Irok6 (a dendromorphic odrisa), that they should not harm cult members of Onile. But there was no reference to Ol6dumare. The concept of deity reflected in the cult celebrations of these two drisa in Oyo state may perhaps best be described by a term used by Friedrich Heiler, namely subjective theism. 21 However, as other bri s were mentioned in the oriki it is important to go on to qualify the kind of subjective theism of the drtisa in the light of other collections of oriki and chants. First, let us look at Verger's collection, drawn from many different parts of Yorubaland. In this truly great work, 22 Verger studied twenty-six brisa' cults, plus the figure of Ol6run. For nine of these and also for Ol6run he has included no oriki, so these we shall have to leave out of account. Of the remaining eighteen drisa, no fewer than half are themselves the sole objects of devotion, no other brifs4 being mentioned. Such include the oriki addressed to fissi, Oditdiiwi, Ositmare and Yemoja. Seven of the remaining nine have oriki that contain references to between one and three other brisa'. In some cases these are in any case usually associated, and are cited by way of defining the position of the brisat concerned. The seven include Oguin, Orany~n, Osun, Oya and S6p6nna. The last two brisa, Obatalt and Sang6, stand out from the rest in that they are associated with no fewer than eight and twelve other drtisi respectively. These two have clearly a special 21 F.

McKenzie status as heads of a cluster of associated deities. Ol6di~mare by contrast is referred to only once in an oriki of Sang6, one of the very few instances recorded in all the oriki. Onilk also does not appear in any way to have the kind of status ascribed to her by Morton-Williams. Verger records no oriki and chants for the Ifat cult group, but William Bascom more than makes up for this lack with his superb collection of verses from the Ifa corpus, likewise drawn from a very wide area. 23 He lists in full I86 'verses', some of them running into several pages each, from about one fifth of the 256 different figures of the odit. These verses contain besides a certain amount of folk-lore, references to many of the 3ris&amp; studied by Verger, and others besides. (Ten of Verger's 6risa are incidentally, not mentioned at all in Bascom's verses.) The concern with other drisa` is to be expected in a divination cult serving members of other cult-groups. What is sur- prising is the extent to which many brisit are hardly mentioned at all. No fewer than nine are mentioned only once, including Oro, Osun, Oya, Obaliifbn and Oramfe; six more are only mentioned twice, including Osanyin and Olosa; a similar number occur three times, including Sng6, Sbpbnna, the Ogb6ni and Oglin. ObtaTla, Ol6kun and Ogrin feature twice as prominently again, as do the evil spirits and the dangerous earth spirits. Then there is an enormous jump to a group of three; Orunmila, the 3rss&amp; of the Ifa cult-group itself, who appears more than forty times, and a little less in evidence, Esil and Ol6run- Ol6dilmarei. These rough statistics more than bear out Bascom's claim that for the Ifa cult-group Orunmila, I?si and Ol6diimare form a kind of trinity, or preferably, triad, in their dealings with the individual, his destiny and his ancestral guardian soul. Ol6ditmare is master of that destiny, with his home in the sky. Orunmilli knows the divine order, Esiu the divine unpredictibility; together they complement the Sky Deity forming a triangle which indeed encloses the individual and his destiny on earth, and even his pre-existence and post-existence. 24 But while this Ifti 3risa-triad assumes a special form, the other brisa~ and their cults seem not to be very closely related to it; many indeed seem to be marginal, or to be ignored altogether. 23 W. R. Bascom, Ifa divination: communication between gods and men in West Africa. Bloomington: Indiana University Press 1969. 24 Ol6duimare is referred to by Bascom as the 'God of Destiny' (The Yoruba, p. 79). In the oriki there appears to be little reference to the general belief that in extremis members of all the cult groups turn to Ol6run-Ol6duimare. Such a belief would tend to be reinforced by the influence of Ol6run-Ala (Christian and Muslim concepts) though to what extent is not clear.</page><page sequence="7">Yoruba Orisa Cults 195 Another observer of the 3drsh cults who has reported on their fes- tivals in a particular area of Oyo state, is the Austrian Ulli Beier. At i'de between 1952 and 1956 he found that the festivals of three cult groups were no longer observed, nine others he was able to describe. 25 On the whole the festivals were separate, but in one case, dancers from another cult-group played a part in the entertainment. In another case two other brisa were referred to in the oriki verses quoted. In the second town, Ilobu, 26 the aris': cults were similarly separate for the most part. The oriki extract for Erinle, the town's most important brish, was addressed solely to the hunting divinity himself. Oya was, however, seen in association with Sang6, a feature we should expect since she is his consort. Then, in addition to 1sui and Ifit, the Ibeji cult of twins seemed to be represented among the other cults, not so much in the oriki verses as in the form of visual images. The Eguinguin cult group seemed to be the most open in membership at Ilobu and also at Osogbo, numbering among its members Muslims and Christians as well. Another feature found at Ilobu was the festival of the images, which provided an opportunity for an ecumenical gathering of members of the nine cult groups of the town which had images in their shrines. Osun, Ogrin and Obitaila were not included. 27 If there is a connection between artistic and religious vitality, Ulli Beier found in this one small Yoruba town in the I950s no fewer than nine flourishing cult-groups. Ulli Beier discusses the cult-groups and the brrisa at Osogbo, not far from Ilobu, in a recent work, The Return of the Gods. 28 This study is concerned with the interesting and controversial attempt by Susanne Wenger, a convert to the brisa, to provide homes (shrines and images) for the brish to settle in, after a long period of uprootedness. Susanne, an Ogb6ni elder and a priestess of Obtailti, has also done much for the official cult of Osogbo, isun. She has given support to the brtisa not only by encouraging astonishing works of art, but also by formulating a kind of universalist bris&amp; doctrine. Her cosmology appears to be a kind of pantheism or panentheism, with Ol6di~mare as the total of the All including the brish, and with each brisa a personalization of the 25 Ulli Beier, A year of sacred festivals in one Yoruba town.

R. McKenzie universe, a kind of Verdichtung, condensation, of the forces of the universe at a certain place, seen from a certain angle. 29 Ol6dhimari is multiple Deity or Being, one at all times and places, but accessible through ritsh devotion. In the only oriki cited, the subjective theism of drisha devotion would appear to be linked with her view of inclusive, multiple Deity. I mention Susanne's views in this way since she has been enabled through her aesthetic sensitivity to penetrate more deeply than any other European known to me into the religious experience of the ol6risa&amp;, the one who 'makes orish'. 30 Finally, I would briefly mention the evidence from the fragments of oriki and chants of festivals reported on by different observers during the past twenty-five years in the Nigeria Magazine. 31 More than a dozen different 3risa are directly addressed and celebrated in the festivals recorded. Of two further festivals of sacred kings, one contains little or no mention of deities; the other, at Ondo, concerned with royal ancestors at Ondo and Ife including Oramfe, only mentions two other 3rish. Turning to the 3rits venerated directly at annual fes- tivals, five have apparently no other associates. The account of a sixth, Sang6, at Osogbo, refers only in a myth to Oya and Osun as his wives. similarly at Ife, Oris.-'l' (ObatVil), is associated explicitly only with Yemoja and Ifa. In the case of Ogt'n in Ekiti, two ,3risY and also O16run-Ol6duimare are referred to in myths. At Ede, Obittld's festival is clearly associated in well-known myths with four other rtisa and with Ol6duimare. One tutelary divinity, Ori-Oki, at Iragbeji is asso- ciated with five other drish&amp;. The Osun festival at Osogbo includes some attention given to seven other 6ri~s but no explicit reference to Ol6dui- mark. Finally, Agemo in Ijebuland stands alone and supreme, having nothing to do with the northern Yoruba 6rish. 32 We have perhaps included enough evidence to see that with more and more material the picture could be continually filled out at some point. But I believe a kind of basic pattern is emerging, though it should be left very much open-ended. We have the basic subjective 29 Ibid., 33f. 30 Cf.

We have the uniqueness of each drith. We have clusters of briS.s round a few prominents ones. We have the special cosmology of the Ifi cult-group. At one point we have Agemo, virtually eclipsing Ol6dlimare as national or Supreme Deity in Ijebu- land. Finally hovering in the background we have myths and legends of the drri~h in interaction, which we have barely hinted at, and whose complexity seems impossible to fathom. Looking back to the tidy models of Yoruba cosmology we must ask, How much of them is it possible to retain? Let us begin again with the individual oris&amp;. The extraordinary richness of Yoruba religion lies in the profusion of its 6ris&amp;, in the facility with which in the past an ritsa has formed and gathered about itself a cult-group. (Aiydlala, is a fairly recent example. 33) There follows in each case inevitably, the entry into relationships with other drish, the division into different drisar, or the coalescing with other eriss (S~ng6 and Jikita). 34 It is subjective theism, with, objectively, Deity particularized and concretized in two directions: a link on the one hand with the natural and impersonal world-hills, trees, rivers, earth, sky; and on the other with the human and personal sphere- societies, historical events, cultural and economic activities, war, farm- ing, healing, founding of cities and towns, kings, culture-heroes, ancestors, peace-makers, down to the individual's spirit double (ori). It is impossible to do justice to the whole range of risa~ but they, and even Ol6diimare and Agemo do seem to have this double aspect, the natural and the socio-historical. Examples are Ol6run, linked with the sky and with the individual's destiny, or S.ing6, associated with thunder and storms, and the royal ancestor of the Oyo kings. The picture is further complicated by the movements of peoples bringing their own brish, the expansion of empires, and above all the flexibility of the Yoruba social system which allows for a considerable element of choice for the individual, and for his being called to serve an arisa other than that of his father or mother or his compound. 35 In all these factors, there are, I believe, two underlying forces: those making for theistic particularity (Gbtterspaltung) and those making 33 J.

The social context of the cults is obviously important in establishing a clear picture of current practices.</page><page sequence="10">198 P. R. McKenzie for theistic reunification (Gottervereinigung). 36 We can see already in the oriki and chants how these opposing tendencies operate. The oriki exalts the particular 3risa, and yet the more it is exalted, the more is the tendency for the accretion of further attributes, including those of other 3riss (by communicatio idiomatum, to use the term coined by Lutheran Orthodoxy). Differing shades and nuances, his- torical particularity and uniqueness preserve the individuality of the 3risa, but most come with time to the position of being able to confer all things upon their devotees: healing, fertility of crops, children, wealth and position, solution of life's problems, fulfilment of personal destiny, and so on. (There are of course other 6risa who are so to speak consultant specialists to be called upon if necessary, such as Ifi, s.iu, Osanyin, Sang6, etc.) Thus, most if not all of the arish combine in one way or another elements of tremendum and fascinosum. They are regarded by devotees as Deity in the full sense, 37 Deity original, not borrowed, inherent not ministerial. All are Deities. The corpus of myths documents the "worldly" interaction of the 3risai and illustrates the forces making for theistic particularity and reunification. 38 But there is doubtless another law, which the 3rish are affected by, that of growth and decline. Perhaps we should say this is a law of the (rAsch cults rather than the 3rish themselves, who as divine beings can never die. The Brish grow by specialization, in providing services for others, in the case of If' and Egringfn, even for Muslims and Christ- ians. General festivals of images (o're) and-more importantly today- participation in one another's festivals also tend to foster the growth of the cults. Finally, expansion of the 3risah cults into the areas of other religions and cultures, leads to the preservation of the rissh under syncretistic forms: in Dahomey under the Vodun, and in Brazil, Cuba and Trinidad, under the forms of the Apostles and Saints. Opposed to all this, of course, is the massive onslaught of Islam, Christianity and Modernity. Summing up: what we see with the 3risa is a series of Deities sub- jected to the operation of an ever changing and dynamic configuration of forces making for particularity and for unity. The triangular cosmo- logical model, reflecting the work of theological speculation, stimulated 3G Cf. A. Bertholet's Gitterspaltung und Gittervereinigung (Tiibingen: Mohr 1933); also F.

Even the revised model is too static. We can, I believe, go farther than Verger's juxtaposed theisms, by admitting to special forms of Deity, clusters of orish, partial uniformities, but not to any complete cosmological picture. We can speak, with C. A. Long, of monotheism as "an enduring struc- ture of the religious experience itself", 39 but we ought not to begin-as Long and so many others do-from 'above', with the result that a complete metaphysical superstructure is tacitly assumed. Rather we must begin from 'below' with the experience of the brisaN cults them- selves; and content ourselves meanwhile with 'open-ended' theisms, clusters, partial configurations and above all different theologies within Yoruba traditional religious cults themselves. Some of these will want to include, and work down from, the Supreme Deity, as a fruit of theological speculation from within, others will proceed in other directions, notably by raising the 3risas to a more and more exalted position. 39 C.
