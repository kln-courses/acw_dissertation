<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PSYCHOLOGY CF THE DEMOCRATIC METAPHOR Bruce R. Pollard, Ph.D. For the purpose of systemizing public administration theory and producing a science of public administration traditional psychology does not easily resolve the democratic metaphor* However, the democratic metaphor comes into clear focus by the use of solipsiatic instrumentalism, which is a deterministic, modem thought modality in the form of a trans personal pragmatism that finds truth to be a function of evolutionary purpose* Solipsistic instrumental ism synergi2es with a pragmatic modification of Freudian psychology, which also de tendinis tic ally references to the autonomous psychoevolutionary machine whose substance is the biosphere* The autonomous psycho evolutionary machine solipsistically resolves as the paradigmatic memory system and the evolutionary economy that recapitulates the necessary stages of evolution in the form of a species specific psychic ontogenetic continuum* The psychic ontogenetic continuum infrastructures the charismatic developmental metaphors by which the autonomous evolutionary economy is geometrically applied to the territorial surrounds* The democratic metaphor is the democrat as the terminal and most efficient evolutionary program that resolves through the te rri to rial iza tion of the solipsistic frontier* It is the self object and the boundary of rational thought* The boundary of rational thought is the concern of public administration theory and the infra structure for the rational management of the governmental hierarchy by the public adminis trato r* The charge of the public administrator is the maintenance of the peace of the state by fostering a community of equals, which, in a modern democratic state, means the fostering of a rational community of equals* The modern democratic state is the most effective form of government; in that a state in the form of a rational community of equals rules by means of enlightened self interest, which terminates in the public interest* The solipsistic modification of Freudian psychology that resolves the boundary of rational thought permits his oedipal centrality to be identified as the hominal Form of Biological Motion, or the mating ritual, and as a tripartite system of controlling vector's* The vectors form the oedipal, oestrus, and objectification continuua. The oedipal vector coordinates behavior; the oestrus vector charism atically organizes by means of the romantic and paranoidal influencing machine; and the oojectification vector recapitulates the psychoevolutionary paradigm in the form psychic ontogenetic development* The objectification of the psychoevolutionary paradigm through the resolution of the ontogenetic metaphors makes possible the management of the autonomous evolutionary machine* The primary charismatic metaphor is the archetypal reproduction unit, who functions as the coordinative, infrastructural referent for the paradigmatic, ontogenetic hierarchy of perception that nonnatively controls behavior through the multiple system organization of the solipsism. The democratic metaphor emerges as an object from the f us ional, matriarchical hierarchy of perception through the mastery of the single system organization of the solipsism. The single system 1</page><page sequence="2">organization of the solipsism resolves the self as an object and functions as the modern criterion of objective Reality. The phenomenology of hierarchical control is that of the unselfconsciousness of self interest that gives the feeling of spontaneous liberty and equality to infancy In actuality it is a hierarchical continuum of individuation from the reciprocally regualted, maternally dominant unity to the mother and the infant as a function of the increasingly ineffective intra and inter objective compen sation of stress and trauma. ^he intra and inter subjective continuum arising out of the dual unity is that of the channeling of the coordinative unconsciousness in the form of partial body, partial-object equivalencies, anchored in the instrumental reality of the mother. These fus ional, homologous equivalencies of the maternal eye, mouth, limbs, body, and mind etc. take the form of a continuum of charismatic signals;, signs, symbols, and metaphors that resolves through the inter objective compen sation and accommodation of stress and trauma. The primary metaphorical equivalents of the charismatic, archetypal reproduction unit are the fraternal inseminating unit; the anthropomorphic God, as the archetypal image of the dead, devoured inseminating unit and the image of instrumental Reality: the madonna and the child; the child; the hero; the heroine, and the democratic self object. The democratic self object is the democrat who masters the infrastructure!, continuum of hierarchical control through the development of the cerebral cortex and the rationalization of the cultural ontology, which permits the self conscious integration of the solipsism and the freedom and equality of enlightened self interest. The resultant democratic metaphor is the most efficient form of the archetypal reproduction unit, in that he enjoys inter objective dominance. The cultural ontology is the being and nature of existence, developed through the socialization of artifacts in the form of units of systemized determinism. It is particlarly with the socialization of scientifically derived artifacts in the form of technology that is responsible for the progressive resolution of the metaphora and the machine age, which forces the sharing of the rationality of straight thinking. The technological freedom of the hominal monad from the totalitarian tyranny of hierarchy is Ihe consequence of the scientific reification of the projective object if ication of the instrument, which lengthens the leg, strengthens the arm, and extend the vision, etc.. Technological freedom can* be'traced'to "the Christian frustration of the mating ritual and the promise that man can find the Reality of God through self determined effort, as implied by the doctrine of predestiratioif. Cultural sexual frustration and the deterministic extension of the doctrine of predestination to the self consciousness of predestined grace is directly traceable in Western civilization the the Christian sanetification of the conjugal contact and to the Calvinistic wing of the Reformation. This dete minis tic continuity required that the conjugal contact be limited to the intentional communion with God through His reproduction in the form of the child. Calvinistic Christianity also extended 2</page><page sequence="3">the service of God to the state in the form of a hierarchy of democratic institutions to produce the frontier oriented American democracy. The asceticism of the Calvinistic state contributed to the pragmatic ontological receptivity to and the invention of new technologies, which was fortuitously assisted by the choice of alcohol as the dominant recreational drug of choice in Western civilization. Alcohol.is unlike marajuana, which increases desire and capacity; whereas, alcohol increases desire and decreases capacity. This is to say, alcohol decreases the effectiveness of traumatic avoidance learning, which nodally references to the trauma of the intra and inter subjectively-compensating and accommodating, controlling conjugal orgasm. The sense of unselfconscious community, generated by the coordinative referencing to the comfort of the archetypal reproduction unit is responsible for the primitive origins of the state, as a consanguinous community of equals. This natural tribal condition of the state generates the totalitarian sense of liberty in the form of an unselfconscious, socially replicating, psychoevolutionary hierarchy of perception. The sense of liberty givds the feeling of fusicnal equality and shared responsibility. Its ideal, operative form is that of theocracy with the inclusion of hierarchically oriented, democratic institutions. Operative oriental theocracy was approximated by the dynastic organization of China before the appearance of venereal disease in the fifteenth century and by the Lutheran wing of the Protestant Reformation. The Chinese dynasty was founded upon the Chinese family village, where the romance of incestuous sexual customs exploited the eternal, hypnotic relationship to the mother. The sexual customs of the Chinese family village included village wide orgies, some of which took place in a large dark room, where it was not possible to identify the sexual consort. The hypnotically centered Chinese family village remained a stable economic unit so long as the central government gave it protection. Without central government protection it became a helpless pawn of the local war lords. The peasant was bom, worked in the surrounding fields, and died with virtually no contact with the outside world. Stangers were stoned and even the tax collector received the same treatment whenever possible. The Lutheran approximation of hypnotically centered rule was that of the agrarian movement that centered upon the close family, as an economic unit, with the leaving of the governing of the state to the divine right of the Princes. Without the custom of primogeniture the family centered, agrarian movement supported a fragmented political economy until the Napoleonic unification of German. The governmental trance is the state of nature that channels control by means of the oestrus organization of the coordinative unconsciousness, through the conjugal elicitation of merging equality and the sense of goodness. Merging .equality and the sense of goodness reference to the collective memory of the dual unity of the archetypal mother and the infant that is replicated in the conjugal contact, where there can be no contractual equality. The merging equality of the conjugal contact makes for the romantic dreaming of the same dream at the same time, as reported by lovers. This equalizing, 3</page><page sequence="4">iinmanently oriented vector intrudes into the life space of the amnesic alcoholic when he finds that he remembers an incident that pleased his feminine companion* The organ-zing vector also infuses the criterion of action of the deliberative body as occasionally reported with humor by the press: Senator X rose to address his colleagues, acknowledged the presence of a female senator, then sat down, having forgotten what he was to say. The Polynesians do not allow women in the tribal council just as conventioning salesmen avoid the presence of women when they do not wish to impair critical communication. In other circumstances the influence of the female rigidifies hierarchy, which can master but tends to be mastered by a complex technological ontology. Stone age man grasped the conjugal aspect of the organizing control of the oestrus vector that compella all of nature, but for man and a few apes, to copulate in unison with the oestrus cycle in his cave painting. He shows the genital of the hunter to be connected to that of the waiting wcman. The dual unity and its coital reinforcement form the fundamental institution, as unconsciousness guarded by the coordinative effect of common and complementary habits. This vectorial channeling of unconsciousness gives structural value to hierarchical organization, as a function of the standardized, inter subjectively polarized normalization of stress and trauma. The values of hierarchical organization comprise the substance of morality, which reduces to the service of the coordinative comfort of the reproduction unit. Moral organization vectorially effects the evolution cf the memory system so as to form the operative implicit assumption that is rationalized by formal organization as the criterion of action. The coordinatively comforting moral infrastructure is evolutionarily projected into a continuum of geometric functioning in the form of ethics, law, power, and virtue. Ethics is the rationalization: of morality that modularly replicates in law; and the complete application of the coordinative comfort of the archetypal repro duction unit terminates in the single system organization of the solipsism. Single system organization is the resultant of the inter objective normalization of stress and trauma that permits the sustained rationalization of the solipsism so as to vectorially select the optimum course of action. This sustained picturing of solipsistic integrity is the substance of power as the knowledge of necessity and virtue to which no rules apply. In that nature takes no leaps the coordinative comfort of morality and the characterological development of virtue through the objectif ication of the integrated solipsism reference to the observed motion of the immortal one ceiled animal, which represents basic truth as the Form of Biological Motion in equilibration with the vectoring forces of the resonating, solipsistic universe* The Form of Biological Motion factors into devouring, as killing and eating; conjugation with the reversal of sexual polarity, as the stressful and traumatic partial devouring communication of territorially acquired information; and fissiioning as the means of replicating the genetic code. These factors represent the reduction of the forms of logic, as induction, deduction, and the dialectic, which metaphorically 4</page><page sequence="5">replicates in the evolution of the solipsism through synthesis and analysis with the retention of proven information. The dialectic also replicates in the hominal mating ritual through the metaphorical female thesis, male antithesis, and child synthesis; and, of course, the mating ritual factors into the oedipal, oestrus, and psychic ontogenetic vectors. The continuity of the evolutionary development of the solipsism demands that behavior vector from the unconscious of the archetypal reproduction unit, comprised of the unconscious body and the archetypal potentiation of the anatomy of the body into the consciousness to form the object representation. The consciousness pragmatically experiences the archetypes and accumulates them in the coordinative subconscious as symbols that are joined to make electrochemical maps of the inside and the outside. The storage of the symbolized object and the maping process in the subconscious forms the operative memory system in response to normative stress and probabalistic trauma. The symbolic inter subjective and inter, objective normalization of stress and trauma resolves as a semiotic system, designed to accumulate and communicate information through the detection and reduction of difference. Stress is imperfect coordination with the vectoring forces of the resonating universe that elicits consciousness. Initial consciousness is neutral and becomes increasingly pleasureful with increasing, resonating excitation. Hyper resonaticn becomes painful at the body boundary of the solipsism. Hyper resonation resolves as acute uncertainty at the instrumental limit and the life instinct. Pain is the solipsistically derived life instinct, because it protects the body from injury by triggering the traumatic avoidance response and causes the probabalistic enlargement of the solipsism* Absent the traumatic avoidance response to pain the organism is subject to unconsciousness, coma, and the pleasure of death. The traumatic avoidance response is one of two learned reactions to stimulus. They are the normative and the probabalistic. The normative response follows the statistical mean that focusses upon the traumatizing conjugal contact, which generates the probabalistic response that deviates from the mean. These responses are analogized by the normal walk and the probabalistic limp. The probabalistic limp may be normalized by the inter subjective assistance of another, or it may be normalized by the inter objective use of a cane. In the case of conjugal trauma normalization tends to proceed by way of inter subjective compensation and accom modation, terminating in a shared unconsciousness. The appearance of the uncompensated and unaccommodated traumatic avoidance response reduces to that of hyper activity and fatigue. Both are forms of hyper activity, which, when sustained, fall into the category of clinical depression. The traumatic avoidance response that is accommodated by the unconsciousness is the neutral habit. Its nodal communicating form is that of the conjugative rush, which tends to be pleasureful, but it may be painful, as in any other social intercourse. Sexual intercourse, culminating in the painful orgasmic rush is one that is neither intra nor inter subjectively normalized. It goes toward con sciousness, rather than unawareness. 5</page><page sequence="6">When the conjugative rush and contiguous drives are pleasurefully compensated and accommodated by inter subjective and inter objective processes, it is identified as romance. Paranoia is the painful and frequently destructive polarity of romance, which follows from and is accompanied by depression. tooth polarities are organised by the oestrus vector, whose force and bias is represented by the Suicidal con jugation of the genetically damaged, male polarized one celled animal. The conjugative bias of the infrastructure of organization is elegantly captured by the Hindu depiction of the Kali and Siva tantra, where Kali is the Divine Mother and the Black Goddess of Death and Siva is the Riallic God and the God of Destruction. Siva is shown as supine with an enormous erection and a smile on his face. Around him are the bones of Kali's previous lovers and a small group of children look an. Kali dances over Siva with the head of a recent lo^er in one of her four hands. In another she holds a sword. She is garlanded with skulls .and entwined with snakes. The continuum of resonating excitation associated with the socially replicating orgasmic rush goes from the uncertainty of neutral awareness, to pleasure, and to pain; and it resolves as the continuum of anxiety. The polarities of the ever present, equilibrating anxiety continuum, reflecting the rescnation of the universe and the following of its vectoring forces, corresponds to the guidance of the Freudian pleasuie-unpleasure principle and what Aristotel called desire by which all things moved toward God. The immanent locus of God is that of the archetypal mean and the repository of psychobiological pleasure in the form of the anatomy, whose physiological potentiation gives rise to the id. The Freudian ego is the operative id, which includes the unconscious, the operative memory system in the form cf the subconscious, and consciousness thatt norma tively and prohabalistically searches for the transcendental aspect of Gbd in the form of instrumental Reality. The super ego is the guilty conscience that references to the poles of the comfort, geometry, territory continuum. The solipsistic super ego is comprised of a map of the body and the outside, whose integration rewards the organism with pleasure and unconsciousness, ^he apperceptive ego is the self as an object that reduces instrumental Reality to the body image, resolved by the single system organization of the solipsism* The territorial ization of comfort is phenomenologically governed by the solipsistic sense of the id, ego, super ego, and the apperceptive ego to form instrumental truth. It is the truth that Freud referenced by means of his pleasure-unpleasure principle, which equates with the solipsistically resolved anxiety continuum. He coordinated his psychology by means of the transference of the oedipal Form of Biological Motion, which vectorially replicates as the Primal Scene, oedipal, and Primal Horde myths. Freud's conceptualization of anxiety is that of a sexual perversion and a signal. He separates anxiety from the pleasure-unpleasure principle and from the" life and death instincts, which he equates with erogeneity and the repetition compulsion. The repetition compulsion is the atavistic recapitulation of the organism's repertoire of behaviors, due to the frustration of stress and trauma, which 6</page><page sequence="7">replicates as aggression and as distressful, coordinative degeneration that goes toward death* The normative discharge of the repetition compulsion in response to stress and trauma goes toward horaeostatic equilibration and evolutionary regeneration. In that the organism always travels toward pleasure and avoids unpleasure, the Freudian motivational referent suggests that the solipsistic equivalent of the death instinct is pleasure, culminating in the coordinative unconsciousness. Deterioration of the traumatically generated anatomy of the coordinative unconsc iousness permits travel to the pleasure of death, which psychoanalytically reduces to eternal coitus with the mother* The ancient religious equivalent of eternal coitus with the archetypal mother is death as eternal life, represented by the hermaphroditic God. '^'he further implication of the solipsistic modification of Freudian psychology is that anxiety can be distinguished form fear, which is the sensation of reorient ation in the face of excessive excitation* If excessive excitation is generalized and overpowering, as often results from the technological disruption of hierarchy, the organizing vector gees toward depressive and paranoida^., free floating anxiety, that is usually very painful* The escape from massive, free: floating anxiety is by way of the repetition compusion to equilibration and regeneration or to death* Death may take the form of a.shock reaction or suicide* Anger is Hie complement of fear, in that anger is the going toward response that terminates in the maximum psychobiological pleasure of the coordinative uncon sciousness* Termination in the maximum psychobiological pleasure of the coordinative unconsciousness represents eternity in the form of the best biological fit with the vectoring forces of the resonating universe* In solipsistic configuration anxiety is the ever present life and death instinct guidance system in the form of resonating uncertainty of varying intensity, which equilibrates the dynamically interacting coordinating, organizing, and objecfifying continua* However, the objectif ication continuum going from the comfort of the coordinative unconsciousness to the territorial outside makes for the functional polarization of anxiety as separation and territorial anxiety, which can be sensed as neutral, pleasureful, and painful* Both territorial and separation anxiety terminate in the body image boundary of the solipsism, which tends to be clouded by the protecting content of the subconscious1* The subconscious connects the unconscious body to the outside in the form of a neural or representational skin, much like the phenomenon of the phantom limb* The phantom limb is the experience of the amputee. He feels as though the severed limb is still connected to his body* The severed limb remains in hi3 thoughts as an image;, and he feels pleasure and pain, arising from the phantom limb* The heural skin is a conscious aspect of the ego that replicates the perimeter of an automobile for the driver and supplies personality to clothing, implements, and habits of the absent and the dead* The imaging of the life and personality of the dead is the identification process that references to the cannibalistic food chain, which gives rise to the devouring disposal of loved ones, to the origin of the oedipally and oestrusly vectored identification with the anthropomorphic God, and to the concept of original sin* 7</page><page sequence="8">Thought processes, comprising the action of the subconsciously 3tored repre sentations of the outside,'fall into four categories. They are matrix, mystical, psychotic, and rational thought. Matrix though is polarized by the body image of the reproduction unit, whose perceptions oedipally and oestrusly reference by way of the multiple system organization of the solipsism. Itystical and psychotic thought have a multiple system reference, without a necessary object. They differ in that mystical thought is the pleasureful vehicle of romance, and psychotic thought is the painful vehicle of paranoia. Rational thought, unlike matrix, mystical, and psychotic thought, is referenced to the body image as an object by way of the territorial integration of the solipsism that terminates in a single perceptual system. Where rational thougjht is the modality of right reason, mystical and psychotic thoughts are the vehicle of the religious understanding of the spirit and the soul, which resolves as semantical ly unattached ideas and feelings. The spirit and the soul represent an extension of the continuum of coordinative unconsciousness that vectors from the experience of the amputee with the phantom limb. Self objectification, as the apperceptive ego and the boundary of rational thought, is a function of the normative terri totalization of stress and trauma. It is a characterological process that terminally generates enlightened self interest, the public interest, and love in the form of the inter objective refer encing of romance. The self object is the model of virtue as "a consequence of the single system organization of the solipsism. The single system organization of the solipsism is a dynamic, evolutionary process, subject to constant, traumatic splitting. Traumatic splitting represses the normative response, and it tends to be inter subjectively referenced to the body image of the reproduction unit by means of mystical, psychotic, and matrix thought. Traumatic splitting of the solipsism is the result of injury to the body and its image that tends to have the form of a permanent avoidance habit, much like a limp. The inter subjective normalization of the traumatic avoidacne habit takes two, closely allied, socialized forms. They are religious and social structure. The religious normalization of trauma and associated stress: is had through the rehearsal of basic truths that centrally reference to the oedipally vectored myths. The rehearsal of a myth is a rite, and the joining_of two or more rites is a ritual. The nodal ritual that infrastructures Western civilzatian is the Christian mass, representing the condensation of the oedipal vector. In effect the Christian mass ritualizes the primal, oedipally replicating institution in form of the mother and the child, which resolves as the substance of hierarchy and the ELa tonic cave*. The Freudian resolution of the religious and social normalization of stress and trauma is a pragmatic unification process based upon the premise, that all behavior in the triadic oedipal relationship is transferred to all other situations The further implication of the Freudian premise is that the oedipal dynamic vectors form the paradigmatic, psychoevolutionary hierarchy as the mating ritual of the haminal monad, which is a modualr replication of the Form of Biological Motion. Q</page><page sequence="9">The normalization of traumatic learning is complicated by its vectoring from the unconscious instrumental boundary of the solipsism* The boundary of the solipsism vibratorially reverses about the mean of the vectoring forces of the resonating universe in the form of a statistical display* The statistical display represents error in the logical progression at the instrumental limit, which takes the classical form of the paradox* The normative, paradoxical error is a propostition that is true and false at the same time* Such a terminal reversal occurs in physics with the discovery of the positive and negative universe, represented by the asymetrical dominance of matter over anti matter, and in mathematics in the form of the definition of infinity* The instrumental limit defines infinity as the greatest distance that can be imagined, plus or minus one unit of length* The body and the potentiation of the archetypes resolve as the unconscious, which makes the mody image the instrumental limit that coordintes with the outside by means of the flitting and flowing of the equilibrating subconscious* The flitting and flowing of the subconscious is perceived as the dream and the hallu cination, which reflect the information processing of the instrument by means of digital and analog measurement* The hallucination is the dream in the waking state* It is generated by replicating the sleep state through non adequate sensory input-in the form of sensory deprivation and sensory overstimulation* The deprivation of adequate and manageable sensory stimulation does not permit the differentiation of the inside from the outside or the generation of a sense of time as the period between events, except as derived from internal processes* Simultaneously, sensory: deptivation and..sensory overstimulation removes the sense of space, as that occupied by events, and creates the condition of dream like, psycho biological eternity. The deprivation of space time creates a vectorially channelled, coordinative eternity where there is little differentiation of direction, the movement of in or out of the body, or conflict* This condition represents the nature of biological unconsciousness that vectors from the barely detectable asymetry of t he resonating universe* The universal vector passes through the coordinative comfort of the reproduction unit along a psychic ontogenetic objectif ication continuum, that terminates in the rationality of her completely territorialized ^rehetype* The psychic ontogenetic objectification continuum replicates the necessary stages of the paradigmatic, psychoevolutionary hierarchy in the species specific reproductive process with the emphasis upon the perceptual differentiation of the reproduced unit form the reproduction unit* The reproduction unit represents the first metaphorical object and the initial instrumental representation of the universe. The psychic ontogenetic objectif ication continuum is the species specific psychoevolutionary paradigm, which resolves as the organismic memory system* The The developmentally evolving paradigm infrastructures the charismatic metaphors that classically program the autonomous behavior of hierarchy. The classical metaphors are the dual unity of the madonna and the child, God as the image of instrumental Reality that reduces to the Single System that encompasses all event3, the child, the hero, and the heroine* The mastery of the infrastructural control 9</page><page sequence="10">of hierarchy takes the form of the democratic self object, as the most effective and terminal metaphor. The initiating substance of the psychic ontogenetic objectification continuum is the mother, who immanently identifies with archetypal objective Reality through the cannibalistic devouring of the experimental insCTihating unit, which represents the food conservation model of reproduction that references to the food chain. Referencing to the transcendental polarity of Reality follows the imaging of the &lt;tead, devoured experimental unit. Transcendental imaging gives rise to the charismatic, anthropomorphic God, as the guiding metaphor that programs the organization of behavior toward the instrumental Reality of the psychoevolutionary progression. The consciousness of the mother that forms hierarchical organization, apexed by the imaging of the charismatic Single System that gives hope and faith to the perceptual universe, is that of a twinkling star. Twinkling star consciousness is infrastructuraHy guided by oedipally vectored separation anxiety. Oedipally vectored separation anxiety is institutionalized by means of the Oedipus complex, which has the form of the inter subjectively polarized compensation and accommodation of the traumatized oedipal vector. This process forms an institutionalized traumatic avoidant gradient of perception that is infrastructuraHy referenced to the reproduction unit. The psychic ontogenetic objectification continuum that infrastructures the classical, charismatic metaphors runs from the embrionic to the dual unity; to the paranoid position, at three months; to the depressive position, at six months; to autoeroticisai; to narcissism; to partial-body, partial-object, object constancy, at fourteen to sixteen months; and on to self objectification after the socialization of the Oedipus complex through the adolescent gang and group recapitualtion of the maternal hierarchy of perception, at about fourteen to sixteen yeara. The psychic ontogenetic continuum psychophysiological^ vectora by means of the fus ional dual unity, where the infant cannot differentiate from the mother, because of the inadequate development of the nervous, system, which is not cephalo caudally myelinated until approximately eighteen months. This inability to differ* entiate the body image from the outside is the dream like, imprinting, identific ation modality, called primary process. Primary process reductively references to the electrochemical measuring and maping of the one celled animal that does not differentiate the map of the body from the map of the outside. It represents the almost total pleasure of the psycho biological unconsciousness in the form of a unity with the universe that is evolut ionarily funded by the development of the anatomy, the potentitati on cf archetypes and the experiencing of the Archetypes to form symbols through the inter subjective and inter objective normalization of stress and trauma. Secondary process is consciousness, generated by the differentiation of the electrochemicl maps of the inside and the outside, whose transitional form tends to be fuzzy and dream like. Primary process hypnotically vectors by means of erogenous indentities from the dual unity of the mother and the polymorphous body of~the infant. The totally erogenous body of the infant equates the many body parts so that the eye, lips, breast, mouth, vagina, mother, and the father, etc. coordinatively ran to the 10</page><page sequence="11">instrumental outside. The vagina equivalency of the mouth is of particular signif icance as it gives the female two mouths by which to execute the oedipal vector; and the penis equivalency of the body and the phallus are the hypnotic channel to the outside that forms the charismatic, experienced Archetypes or symbols, whose logic terminates in the reversal. The erogeneity of the body of the infant gradually neutralizes with inter subjectively polarized development until sexual sensitivity is largely confined to the gehetals and the breast. In that genital activity in all of nature, but for man and a few apes, is commanded by the oestrus cycle, flexibility of response to the oestrus command is said to be due to the evolution of the enlarged cerebral cortex. The enlarging cerebral cortex made for the sustained differentiation of response to the oestrus cycle through the inter objectively polarized integration of the solipsism. It has been noted that in man the oestrus vector causes closely affiliated women to ovulate at the same time, and the hormonal cycle of the monogamous male follows that of his wife. In this context Freud observed that he became impotent every twenty eight days. In that the oestrus cycle is the organizer of all behavior it threads together the transference of the oedipal relationships and the psychic ontogentic objectiv ication continuum. Oestrus control is romantically reinforced by the inter subjective normalization of the stress and trauma of the coital contact; and it is displaced by depression and paranoia through the action of adventitious, trauma and by sexual over stimulation, leading to traumatic addiction. The organizing continuum runs from the dual unity via hypnotic suggestion and seduction to over stimulation. Over stimulation leads to romantic traumatic addiction, additional uncompensated and unaccommodated trauma leads to frustration in the form of depression, paranoia, and death* The normative dynamic of the organizing continuum is that of the aggressive repetition compulsion, which atavistically recapitulates the instruments repertoire of behaviors until equilibrium is effected. With equilibrium death is averted, and the repertoire of behaviors is e volutionarily recapitulated. The organizing vector classically objectifies in the dreams of the deterior ating schizophrenic as the influencing machine. He dreams that his body loses its head and becomes a coffin with legs and arms painted on it. It resembles the Egyptian sarcophagus. Eventually, the coffin becomes a box containing technology, which controls his behavior. The psychoanalytic resolution of the contents of the influencing machine is that of the penis. The box is the vagina. Together they replicate as the dual urity, death as the eternals aoitus of the mother and the child, eternal life in the form of the hermaphroditic God, and the charismatic infra structure of the classical metaphors, which are responsible for the development of tehcnology as a function of the f motivational objectif ication of the hominal instrument. Of the three vectors, the coordinator, the organizer, and the paradigmatic objectifier, the Freudian, coordinating oedipal vector is the most fundamental1. 11</page><page sequence="12">It is the most fundamental, because it coordinates by local motion positioning in references to the vectoring forces of the resonating univers, as does the behavior of the one celled animal, which resolves as the behavior of the primordial psychobiological unit# In mythological terms the oedipal vector coordinatively replicates as the Primal Scene, Oedipal, and Primal Horde myths. The raodularly replicating oedipal vecttor channels frem the dual unity oneness with the universe as the Primal Scene myth in the form of the food conservation model of reproduction in keeping with the food processing substance of Reality. It is the archetypal devouring of the insmin ating unit in consumation of ifae coital contact that is reminiscent of the implied invention of conjugation by the one celled animal in the form of partial devouring. The Primal Scene myth represents the psychobiological focus of attention that is symbolized by the fire in the Platonic cave. The oedipal vector emanates from the Primal Scene as hierarchy through the institutionalization of the Cedipus complex to for the functioning Platonic cave# Oedipla institutionalization metaphorically proceeds to the outside by means of charismatic, emblematic equivalents of fire of which the most common are the stars, the cross, the pieta, the sphinx, multiple limbs, and the feminine skirt that vails the vagina. The skirt, of course, replicates as the flag, etc.. The diverting of attention of Hie sheepish troglodytes from the fire in the Platonic cave is the mission of Plato's priest like philosopher king, who is haloed by the sun light at the mouth of the cave. His mission is the promotion of life in the green pastures. The green pastures represent the organization of and the emergence from the cave through the progressive integration of the solipsism. It is a process that the priest is incapable of completeing without the assistance of the democratic state. The priest is incapable of liberating the sheep from the controlling influence of the Platonic cave, because the vectorial organization and emergence from the cave into the freedom of the green pastures has the form of a single system organization of the solipsism, which is a technological feat that destroys the archetypal influence of the priest. Although the religious organization of the cave through the archetypal diversion of attention from the entrancing conjugal focus by means of the Single System is what makes possible the acceptance of technology, it is the transcendental integration of the cultural ontology that gives the humanistic troglodyte the advantages of rationality, peace, and modern democracy as a function of the technological enhancement of the senses and the physical capacity of the hominal monad. The technological enhancement of the senses and the physical capacity of the hominal monad lies within the responsibility of the state that fundamentally references to territorial sovereignty as a function of the integrative abrogation of the traumatically ir.stitutionaled oedipal vector. The religiously mediated, archetypal vectoring of behavior from the Primal Scene is coordinatively transferred by the oedipally oriented reproduced unit, who unknowingly kills the father and unknowingly marries ^identifies with/ the mother. ihe triadic oedipal relationship originates archetypal evil in the form of the *rk skinned, night visiting father, who separates the 'infant from the mcfther aid, thereby, releases the oedipal vector. The frustrated deman d for the aggressive 12</page><page sequence="13">destruction of the intervening, dark skinned father is the substance of the triadic Oedipus complex by which the Form of Biological Motion is traumatically transferred tc hierarchical organization by inter subjective institutionalization and displaced to the outside by inter objective resolution and abrogation. The inter subjective institutionalization of the Oedipus complex generates a disciplined hierarchy, centered upon the cannihalistically imaged, anthropomorphic God. The cannibalizing of the Father to form the anthropomorphic God resolves as original sin, for which there is an archetypal guilt that infrastructures hierarchy and replicates in ethics and law. The reductive projection of guilt resolves; the basic ^crime', which isdisobedience, qt -the deviation from the'hierarchical norm for which the ultimate punishment is banishment and the phenomenological sense of death in the form of painful separation anxiety. The inter objective displacement of the Oedipus complex through the Single System organization of the solipsism produces the state of enlightened self interest and evolutionary contractural equality, where no law applies. Oediplaly derived, dark skinned evil in the form of the coital father is the archetypal curse that stigmatizes the pigmented races, which is relieved by the rationality and pragmatism of modern democracy. The curse of the .dark skin takes its most hideous form in the civilized persecution of the Jews. The most flagrant recent excample of the archetypal persecution of the Jews by a civilized nation was that of Hitler's Germany. He prioritized the extermination of the european Jews by gradations of skin color. The less obvious factor that released the archetypal fury of the romantic German hierarchy against the Jews was their tribal organization, which is overtly based upon the eternally coital father. The totalitarianism of rigid German, social and political hierarchy represents sophisticated tribal organization, based upon thinly vailed, unrequieted love death that is allegorized by the epic romance of Siegfraid and Brunnhilde. Hitler imaged the heroic Siegfreid, and Eva Braunn, his platonic mistress, became his Brunnhilde. The dark skinned Jew unselfconsciously flaunted the frustrated romance of heroic, German organization by his tribal~credo: A man is not a man without a woman; take care of your own; and take advantage of others. The organizational picture is that of the heroic German hierarchy, infrastructurally pitted against the archetypal evil of the eternally coital father, which trans ferred to all non Germsns with the increasing efficiency of the rigid instit utionalization of the German romance. The oedipal vector has beeen historically best objectified and managed by the calvinistic branch of the Reformation, which represents organizational theory that is diametrically polarized by that of the dark skinned Jew. Its historical reference is that of King Henry TLU^a projection of the ultimate Renaissance man and the primal modern democrat that was brought into 18th century perfection by the puritanical frontiersman. The oedipal vector is the assassination modality of the troglodyte, who is not rigidly controlled by the reciprocally animating social hierarchy*. The vector came into clear focus with Mark David Chapman fs 3hooting of John Lennon. Lennon unselfconsiously modeled the archetypal romantic relationship to the mother 13</page><page sequence="14">by means of the ballad, which he both wrote and sang. Chapman shot Lennon, because he was an imposter. He was an imposter to Chapman, because Chapman identifed with Lennon1 s heroic depiction of success with the maternal, archetypal model of the heroine. However, in the failing of the hypnotic consumation of the romantic trance, Chapman found Lennon to be the intervening, archetypal Father, which released the frustrated oedipal vector. The oedipal transference is common place in social intercourse. Perhaps the most simple form of the transference, its analysis, and correction is that of the mother1 s reaction to the return of her lost child. When the child is returned to her, she takes it to her breast, and hugs it. She then places the child at arms length, compares her memory representation of the child to the perceived child, then slaps it. She slaps the child, because of her frustration in finding that the pejceived child is different frcm her memory of the fus ional dual unity. This triadic analysis is a matrix replication of the Oedipus complex and its institutionalization as social structure. The archetypal transference of oedipal violence to the more generalized social structure is accomplished by the rehearsal of the Primal Horde myth. The Primal Horde myth is that of the brother's combining in their effort to kill the father and sexually service the mother. In so doing they archetypally kill and eat the Father and Fall victim to the sibling rivalry form of the oedipal vect&amp;r. The control of the chaos of sibling rivalry is through religious ritual, designed to protect the troglodyte from the spirit and soul of the Father in the form of the jealous, anthropomorphic God. The comparatively undisplaced oedipal vector is institutionalized by the tribal organization of the stone age, Australian aborigine. The mother eats the children, and the institutionalized, tribal mother eats the old men and enemies. In this way the hierarchically institutionalized Oedipus complex resolves as the machine of war and as the mass mating ritual. The production of the mass mating ritual and its displacement, however, requires the standardization of the reproduction unit to be useful to civilization. Her standardization is not just important to the mass experience of the dual unity as the means of having a comnon memory and a common sense of goodness, but her standardization is vital to the reinforcement of the dual unity relationship in the coital contact. The displacement of the oedipal vector is accomplished by ceremony and ritual, which erogenizes relationships by transfering the feelings, intrinsic to the dual unity instittution and its coital replication. In the development of tribal organ ization the chief, at one time, de flora ted the bride by sleeping with her on the wedding night. Later, defloration was achieved by the ceremonial use of a phallus. This displacement of the oedipal vector to the chief, as the hurtful father and his polar opposite, facilitated the acceptance of the groom as a son lover, whom the bride could nurture. It is a custom that appears in the American culture in the form of a trip to the gynecologist for the surgical cutting of the hymen before the wedding night. The tribal defloration ceremony eventuated in the custom of the couvard, where 14</page><page sequence="15">the son consort husband took to his bed with the birth of a child and was given care and a special diet by the new mother. In effect the father, as the sibling inseminating unit, developed a sense of oedipal competition in reaction to the new child, which demanded the reassurance of his wife* as primitive as this custom may be, it was pa rt of the infra structural development of Egyptian civilization, which rested upon the mass production of a benign reproduction unit and a child like male within geographically secure frontiers. The more sophisticated Christian displacement of the oedipal vector is the ritual of the mass, where the communicant eats God the Father in the form of the Son. It is a ritual that, understandably finds ready acceptance among cannibals, in that it condenses archetypal organization, as found in the practices of the stone age, Australian aborigines. The importance of the mass is that it religiously distances the oedipal vector fran th? marital relationship in a way that offers the potential for independent behavior, centered upon a common metaphorical guidance system, The religious standardization and displacement of the oedipal vector contributes mightly to the efficiency and economy of a civilizatioh, because it ritualizes the coital contact as well as snactifies the marital union and its ideal dissolution through death* Of central significance is the standardization of the coital contact as it fosters the same dream at the same time, as reported by lover's. Having the the same dream at the same time is the concentric modulator of the memory system and the generator of the implicit assumption that formalizes as the driterion of action and as the- substantive reference for an economy. The efficiency of an economy turns upon the production of sophisticated metaphorical programs, and its survival effectiveness depends upon the production of the educated democrat, as the most efficient, managing metaphor. The standardization of the implicit assumption is allegorized by the solipsistic resolution and reduction of the origin of civilization, which reflects the biblical allusion to the church as a harlot. It is said that civilization began with the mass production of grain, requiring the administration of an irrigation system and the storage of grain in central granaries. It is frcm the granaries that grain was dispensed during periods of scarcity. Around the granaries grew trade. With trade came harlots. The priest followed and religiously trained the harlots. later, the granaries became temples* The solipsistic resolution and reduction of the origin of civilization in the form of the allegorical relationships between the priest and the harlot silhouettes the basic administrative charge of the priest, as the formation and standardization of the benign reproduction unit. The contribution of the harlot was the production of a common implicit assumption in her clients, so as to make for commercial economy and efficiency through mass communication* which acts to unify relationships by the detection and reduction of difference* The contribution of the priest obviates the nedd for the harlot through addiction to the standardized coital contact* The ministry of the priest goes father than the mass addiction to the standardized coital contact* If he is to contribute to the peaceful organization of the natural state in the form of the equality of the Platonic cave, he must maintain the benign reproduction unit* The maintenacne of the benign reproduction unit involves the ritualistic accommodation of the depression and paranoia of the oestrus vector, that 15</page><page sequence="16">arises from sexual and coineomitant over stimulation* TJ 3 reciprocally animating Oedipus complex that is inter subjectively normalized by the religiously standardized coital contact and by group affiliation to form the infrastructure of hierarchy is demonstrated by the experimental development of the drive and the contiguous drive. Tie apparatus for the demonstration c? the traumatization of the oedipal vector to 2&gt;rm the Oedipus complex and the development of the contiguous drive that infra ctures social hierarchy is that of a two compartment box, which a connecting doorway. One compartment is painted white, which has an electric grid in the floor. The other compartment is painted black. A. rat is introduced into the white compartment and given a mild shock. He runs into the black compartment and continues to do so when placed in the white compartment. This represents the internalization of a drive referenced to the white compartment stimulus. The white compartment stimulus evokes uncertainty at the instrumental limit, because the rat cannot determine the cause of his pain that is avoided by running into the black compartment. When the doorway to the black compartment is closed and connected to a wheel that can open it, the rat manifests white compartment anxiety in the form of rest lessness and eventually learns to open the connecting door to the black compartment by turning the wheel. The closing of the door between the white and black compartments frustrates the ratfs habitual response. The frustration of the habitual response exposes vibratory uncertainty that reduces to separation anxiety. Separation anxiety is the froce that compels compliance with the organizing oestrus vector that moves from suggestion to seduction, to over stimulation, to traumatic addiction, to depression, to paranoia, and to death. The continuum of separation anxiety is otherwise identified as the Freudian pleasure unpleasure principle and the solipsistic death live instinct. The use of a mild electrical shock to generate uncertainty at the instrumental limit is not really necessary to-.develop the addiction, the drive, or-the habit* The ha hit can 'be elicited by means of stressful expectation, as demonstrated by Skinner box experiments. The Skinner box contains a hopper that dispenses pellets of food with each pull of a lever, or the delivery of the pellet can be randomized. Rats trained to predictable feeding will cease pulling the lever when the hopper is empty* Randomly trained rats keep pulling the lever on an on and off schedule, indefinitely. Random training produces gambling behavior that can irradiate in the form of contiguous drives, which are never quite as apparent as in the case of the inveterate fisherman, who continues to buy elaborate equipment and go fishing, year after year, in the face of very poor catches. His contiguous habit complex" is also mcs t evident in the fish stories he tells, about the one that got away. Traumatic avoidance learning with dogs more adequately demonstrates the force of the generic perceptual hierarchy that is infrastructuraHy referenced to the 16</page><page sequence="17">reproduction unit by means of the institutionalized Oedipus complex* The shuttle box is used in the traumatic avoidance learning of dogs* It is a two compartment box with electrical grids in the floors. Each ceiling has a light that can be turned on as a signal, and the boxes are separated by a barrier. The barrier can be made into a wall by a taped, transparent guillotine, which is apparent when it is lowered. iL dog is introduced into one side of the shuttle box. The light on the opposite ceiling is turned on, and a subtetanizing shock is delivered through the floor grid. The dog jumps to the lighted side. He continues to jump from side to side, indef initely, with the turning on of the light on the opposite side. The extinction of the traumatic avoidance response is accomplished by altern ately having the dog jump into an electrified grid of equal shock value to the original stimulus and by lowering the guillotine so that the dog jumps at the com pleted wall and falls to the floor in a yelping, thrashing mass of motion, which may be allied to the restlessness of extreme anxiety, associated with clinical depress ion ^and paranoia* when the experimenter turns on the signal light the dog jumps with more alacrity after experiencing a subtetanizing shock in the area that would normally signify sa fety* This reinforcement demonstrates that the dog has accommodated the traumatic avoidant jump response in the coordinative unconsciousness, where there is little sense of time* This accommodation of the jump response in the timelessness of the unconscious and the subconscious produces the infrastructurally split solipsism that organizes by means of the multiple system organization of the solipsism in reference, to the archetypal reproduction unit* This consciousness can be ration alized, so as to produce an integrated picture of the outside, just so long as the organism is undisturbed by the conditioned stimulus* The matrix thought infrastructure that is generated by traumatic splitting is what controls hierarchy, which can rationalize the criterion of decision so as to form an alliance, but it cannot necessarily carry out the commitment. The eventual extinction of the jump response in the dog to the point where he will jump on command only when the guillotine is not lowered signifies the reintegration of the organization of the solipsism that will sustain rational behavior. The reintegration process is that of the territorialization of separation anxiety at the solipsistic frontier, through thrashing about on the floor of the shuttle box and experiencing further punishment, which brings the self into the consciousness through the frustration of the conditioned Form of Biological Motion* With the development of the single system organization of the solipsism the dog has become inner directed by what is called character* This is to say, he can now jump appropriately in response to the conditioned signal as a function of enlightened self interest, which speaks to the adage: Spare the rod and spoil the child. The vunerablity of the matrix institutionalization of the traumatic avoidance response in the form of social structure and the development of a contiguous value system is most profoundly and devastatingly found in the exclusion from the tribal hierarchy by the ritual of voodoo. The ritualistic exclusion from the tribe by by voodoo is called voodoo death. It involves the witch doctor1 s ceremonial 17</page><page sequence="18">recitation of incantations and the rattling of bones, designed to cause the death of the victim. The similarly impressed tribe acts as though the victim was already dead. The voodoo exclusion from the tribe denies the victim his habitual inter subjective compensation and accommodation of anxiety through socioreligious coordination. He, thereby, goes into an anxiety state, which elicits the repet ition compulsion. His pupils dilate, his nostrils widen, his pulse races, and his blood pressure rises. He may vomit, evacuate, and panic. The process goes toward hyper ventilation, dizziness, lack of coordination, shock, and death. The equivalent of the devastating exclusion form the tribe is the destruction of hierarchy, symbolically or in actuality, which may be the result of the intro duction of technology, as in the case of massive technoeconomic aid to the third world. The victim may not die, but his is likely to revolt as the means of re establishing the traditional inter subjective adjus*bnent with accompaning depressive, paranoidal, and suicidal, behavior. Cases of mass suicide as a function of the over powering threat to hierarchical organization range from the Jews at Massada, to the Japanese troops at Saipan, and to Jonestown, 1978. The Jfews committed mass suicide rather than surrender to the Romans. The Japanese troops at Saipan chose suicide over surrender to a superior American force, and the Jonestown incident, was an even more distresssing example of mass paranoia, running to suicide. The Jamestown tragedy followed from the effort to help by the Peoples Temple Church in San Francisco, headed by Jim Jones. His parish consisted of the down trodden, who could not enter the mainstream establishment. They were mostly black. The founding of Jonestown in Guyana was intended as a retreat from what was perceived as an uncaring mainstream. Congressman Leo Ryan went to Guyana as a representative of the establishment to ascertain the problem. In so doing he triggered a par anoidal reaction that resulted in the^suicide of men, women, and children, similar to the mass suicide at Massada. The significant defense against the impact of the adventitious and technological disruption of the social and governmental hierarchies is the inter objective novn alization of stress and trauma as part of the educative process, that goes toward the acculturated single system organization of the solipsism. The solipsistic defense has the form of the mastery of the oedipal and oestrus vectors through the devel opment of enlightened self interest, which terminates in the public interest and a viable, modern democracy. The alteraalte administrative defense against the disruption of hierarchy is rigidification and totalitarian control of public institutions which include the educational, judical, and military systems, as well as the central and per ipheral governmental bodies. In that the totalitarian and democratic systems can be measured by means of the psychic ontogenetic objectification continuum it is possible to develop a science of public administration, whose purpose is to keep the peace through the fostering of a community of equals. i a</page><page sequence="19">SEIECTED BIBLIOGRaPHY df Aquili, Eugene G., Laughlin, Charles, D.
