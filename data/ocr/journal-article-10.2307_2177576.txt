<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONSTITUTIVE CONSISTENCY. CONSISTENCY may be defined as the tendency of any self- determined system of activities to maintain itself.' The self involved is most concrete, namely, the reflective multipolar self-in-relations-to-other-selves of social experience. Types of consistency may be distinguished as habitual and accommodative, the former being a tendency to repeat and keep up present organization, the latter, a tendency to reorganize the reflective consciousness whenever the unity and continuity of experience demands it. The former is sameness in objects and motor proc- esses; the latter is a readiness to abandon or remodel the old object, and to readjust the self, whenever greater unity and sim- plicity or the perfect continuity of experience may need it. The result of the two tendencies is the continual revamping of con- ceptions and re-articulation of the world which actually make up the course and content of reflective experience. Reflective ex- perience is self-maintaining, and consistency is an immediate con- sciousness of that quality. The self needs a manifold content; but we also need continuity, harmony, and coherence. We need impulsiveness and spontaneity, but also the inhibition and con- trol of impulse. We need variety, but know that without unity it were mere blind confusion and chaos. These two types of self-maintenance are found in all the typical attitudes and activities of life. They appear within each of several distinguishable kinds of self-maintenance, that of judgment, of practical action, of purpose, etc. Let us, in this paper, consider the consistency which constitutes the world, the consistency of objective contents. It is a familiar fact that no content is absolutely fixed and changeless. Quality changes and objects are continually losing and acquiring their attributes. Trees, stones, stars, government's, atoms, fairies, -nothing persists except as we choose so to re- gard it. Nothing permanent is given in experience, and when 1 Cf. Journal of Phil., Psych., and Sc. Meth., Vol. III, pp. II3 and 457. 2I</page><page sequence="2">22 T H E PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. we appeal to the evidences of the senses to prove the reality of any object, we actually appeal, not to the given qualitative fac- tors of sense, but to reason or something far removed from sense. ' There is a spring beside the Hurricane trail.' ' How do you know ?' ' Because I can again go and slake my thirst from it.' But the proof does not lie in the mere qualitative content of the experience. It lies also in the postulated continuity of the exis- tence of the spring which consistency demands. This will ap- pear from the following genetic classification of contents. Content of experience may be either (i) the bare content of immediate experience, the flash of light in the night, the child's 'first' experience of the candle flame, or (2) a content which suggests other contents, as the hitching-post suggests other contents to the horse, or (3) contents which imply other con- tents having the significance of predictions and controls. The first is mere quality; the second is quality associated with other qualities empirically; the third is a manifold of qualitative con- tents organized and set over against the self as objects of reflec- tion, contents arranged in series or systems corresponding point for point to the activities of self. The first sort of content arises without meaning out of the continuum of existence. In the second an almost characterless continuum, illuminated here and there by some bright moving thing, shot through with pain, or grey-green with discomfort and hunger, has begun to break up and organize into a cosmos. Association and assimilation have begun, and those complex chains of ideas which are the simplest and most fundamental forms of thought. All contents presuppose conative attitudes and self-reference, but in neither of the two sorts of content just mentioned are these presuppositions contents. All content is the fruit of action, but in neither of these is the action self-centered or deliberate. Contents of the third order are only possible where the self has begun to function as the controlling factor of action. Self-reference is then no longer presupposed but actual. Self has become the most important determinant of the organi- zation of contents. Contents are here permanent and coherent; they are objects with the individuality and interrelatedness of a</page><page sequence="3">No. i.] CONSTITUTIVE CONSISTENCY. 23 world. But the permanence and coherence are not mere quali- ties given, like colors, in sensation. They are demands made by the self upon the recurring elements of its experience. They characterize contents which consist with the self by sharing its unity and continuity. And they are not absolute. No attribute or combination of attributes, as such, possesses unity and con- tinuity. When we ask, What is permanent? all we can say in answer is, That which recurs and abides, and this is no single nameable thing whatsoever. These traits belong to the accom- modative rather than to the habitual type of consistency. They are prospective and demanded, while qualities are retrospective and given. The latter are, as a matter of fact, never recurrent or permanent. As a principle of selection in thinking, the demand for con- sistency and self-maintenance is a prior. The object as such must consist with the self, and for this reason we find its con- sistency in it. It is not an object, but a mere fancy, unless it is continuous and harmonious with other objects in the unity of a permanent and orderly world. Constitutive consistency is ob- jective as well as a prior. Hence the scientific and philosophical ideal of absolute truth and infallible judgment. This ideal con- tains all the essentials of constitutive consistency, abstracted from the correlative demands of other kinds of consistency. It is the absolute thought, the unconditioned intelligence. We turn to it with emotions of reverence and dependence for correction, sobriety, and commendation. Like other ideals, it is both habit- ual and accommodative, both understood and mysterious. So long as unidentified objects remain in the world, the ultimate demands of constitutive consistency remain mysterious, and a part of existence remains unrelated by correspondence to the self. The infallible judgment and completely intelligible world are as fundamental in the intellectual life as the notion of a reg- ular law-abiding will is in the practical life. This defines an immediate motor attitude or passion, and it gives law to all par- ticular judgments: ' So think that the principle of your judgment may be universally available for control.' Hence the autonomy of the intellect. The infallible judgment</page><page sequence="4">24 THE PZILOSOPRICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. is really a demand of all judgment made upon itself, a demand which grows out of the fact that judgment is the controlling factor in a self-maintaining experience. Unconscious utility is perhaps the chief principle of selection in primitive thinking, but this demand for self-maintaining infallibility is as much more than unconscious utility as self-consciousness is more than an emotion of pleasantness or unpleasantness. The notion of an infallible judgment is that of one in which the ordinary tentative quality of the conjunction of fact and value is modified by the consciousness of an unerring technique. It is not the notion of a mind for which all questions are already answered, so much as that of a judgment for which all real questions are answerable, because the data of thought are known and the method of pro- cedure is familiar. The ideal judgment is a postulate, a motor attitude, a pilot star. It is a demand that judgment possess a perfect technique and that this be not in any particular case vio- lated or dethroned. If I fail to judge aright, I suffer not only inconvenience, pain, or death, but also the chagrin of incompe- tence in my own eyes. The individual recognizes not only that he would better judge aright, but also that he ought to do so. The reflective imperative is as categorical in the theoretic sphere as in the practical, and utilitarian sanctions are as hypothetical here as there. With this introduction let us take, as the first form of consti- tutive consistency, objectivity. By this we mean permanence and coherence (both of them forms of continuity) in that which con- trols action. There are other connotations in the term, to be sure, but as a constitutive form of experience this seems to be its meaning. Your genuine object must abide from hour to hour; it must be the same for others as for me; it must harmonize and cohere with all other objects in the total content of experience. In this sense, objectivity spells publicity in the content of experi- ence; and publicity is continuity. In both the child and the race the demand for continuity shows itself in assimilation. Contents of experience are assimilated to the self-type, as we have seen, before they are distinguished from the self as things. This is because objectivity depends for its origin upon what</page><page sequence="5">No. i.] CONSTITUTIVE CONSISTENCY. 25 might be called a social technique of judgment. All knowl- edge is at first anthropomorphic. Very slowly we have learned that trees do not feel, that the wind does not choose, that the sky has no passions, and that rivers flow indifferent to human good and ill. We have learned that things do not behave, like selves, in capricious and unpredictable ways. The general atti- tude of expecting certain events when other events occur, the attitude described in the mechanical conception of the world, develops slowly. In contrast to it the attitude of hesitation and uncertainty is formulated in the conception of free and teleo- logical self-determination. Both are in the end objective, but objects marked by teleological behavior are unique in this, that among them we class ourselves. Neither is objective until a technique of judgment has developed so far as to free the mind from the practice of assimilating all things to a vague wilfulness. The difference between the psychical and the physical is pri- marily a difference between two modes of behavior in objects, not a difference between an order of existence called subjective, which is absolutely distinct and independent, and another order called objective. For the purposes of the plain man, it is necessary to distinguish between the world, including his own body, and the mind. He is often more interested to know what is passing in the ' mind' of a man than to know what the latter is actually doing in the world. So the plain man constructs a system of ideas, images, purposes, impulses, motives, and dispositions be- hind the visible exterior of his fellow. He finds such a pictured world available for purposes of control in dealing with his fellow. So also the psychologist constructs a mind inside the organism, dependent on the nervous system and isolated by absolute chasms from other minds in other bodies. The mind is an instrument or tool for perfecting the organic life, each mental construct having its function in facilitating the process of adjustment. So also it is to the interest of the physiologist to conceive mental events as mere accompaniments or effects of neural events. But no one of these ways of representing mind can be taken as valid beyond the spheres of experience within which they are constructed. When we ask for the ultimate and universal relation of mind</page><page sequence="6">26 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REkIEW [VOL. XVI. and body, we are obliged to begin by rejecting the ordinary causal theories of interactionism, parallelism, and automatism, while at the same time recognizing their relative validities for the plain man, the psychologist, and the physiologist. The idea of two absolutely different worlds, the one material and the other mental, is metaphysically indefensible. Continuity is indispens- able in a world. Mind and body cannot be two absolutely dis- crete contents in experience and be equally objective. When so conceived, the former ceases to be objective at all; and this is one explanation of the subjective character of most modern ideal- ism. We have followed Descartes in regarding these two as discrete. When continuity ceases between the parts of the world, subjectivism results. It is, of course, one of the laws of consistent experience that its objects be isolated, individual, and permanent. The object of interest and attention is always unique. If it be a social or shareable thing and possess continuity, it is relatively independent of other objects, a 'this thing' distinct from 'the rest of the world.' To the plain man this may seem an exception to the law that continuity is essential to objectivity; but no mere object is absolute. The next wave of sensory impulse disturbs the equilibrium of the moment and a new object is demanded. Ex- perience contains a manifold of moments, each of which is from some point of view unique. Within each moment a dualism of retrospective and prospective factors is present, datum and idea- tum, fact and value. Each object contains both, and each cor- responds thus to the activities of the continuous self. The con- tent of the world is a manifold of correspondences between self and the rest of the world. Meanings and values are links con- necting fact with fact in the continuous context of existence. Contents are not to be conceived as absolute individuals, held together by some synthetic activity. They are rather to be regarded as an individual composed of individuals, a single world which is nevertheless manifold. Discreteness without continuity is chaos; continuity without discreteness, an empty attitude. In both its discreteness and its continuity, the self gets its own from its world. In its practical, common-sense aspect, the latter</page><page sequence="7">No. I.] CONSTITUTIVE CONSISTENG1. 27 is manifold, but in this aspect it corresponds to the interests and needs of the self. Its law may be set down as x + i, and its ex- tent is unlimited. We may even define manifoldness as mere plurality, divesting our minds of all subtlety in thinking of it, and still regard it as a form of consistency, as law of contents. It is the consistency of sensation, the need of variety, the individuality of parts. There are, however, two sorts of manifolds. Those formed according to the law X + i are on their surface discon- tinuous, like the series of whole numbers which correspond to them. Their elements are irreducible, while between any two elements there exists an infinite number of moments which do not belong to these manifolds. The transitions from element to ele- ment are not obvious. In taking an interest in any one, we ought on the face of it to exclude ourselves from all others. Such is the world as a mere manifold. Nevertheless, the flight from element to element is actual. The transitions are as familiar as the elements. The latter can- not be absolutely individual, and we set ourselves the task of in- creasing the elements to fill in the gaps and discover the missing links. This is the task of discovering continuity in discreteness, corresponding to the continuity of the self. We need another sort of manifold, one of such nature that, in being interested in any one of its parts, we do not sacrifice the rest, one of such nature that the dividing element of interest belongs to either part and to both. This is the continuous manifold. In the words of Poincare ' "A system of elements will form a continuum if we can pass from any one of them to any other by a series of consecutive elements such that each is indistinguish- able from the preceding."' In a straight line, for example, a single point divides the whole into two parts such that every point in one part lies outside the other part, the dividing point may be assigned to either part, and both the line as a whole and all its parts are infinitely divisible. Between the elements of the system of whole numbers there are points which do not fall within the system, points which are not themselves whole numbers. This system is therefore a discontinuous manifold. If these were the ' Science and Hypothesis, G. B. Halstead's tr., 1905, p. 26.</page><page sequence="8">28 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVI. only real numbers, it would follow that only those points on a straight line whose coordinates are whole numbers are real; and, in that case, the circle inscribed in a square and the diagonal of the square would not really intersect. Hence the system of real numbers described by Dedekind contains not only all whole numbers, but also all irrational or incommensurable numbers, and the real number system is continuous. Every law of causation illustrates the necessity of continuity in discreteness. The antecedent, C, and the consequent, E, must be identical so far as to make the transition from one to the other continuous, but they cannot be really identical and present a genuine sequence at all. Again, how can one body act on an- other body at a distance ? Newton held it to be impossible, and hence his corpuscular theory of light. On the other hand, how can two bodies act on each other if they are continuous? In the physical concept of contact, these two demands meet; but the mystery of the process grows on one until the word contact appears a name for our ignorance, unless we steady ourselves by the reflection that contact is consistent with the self, while neither absolute continuity nor absolute discreteness is so. The question of the reality of solids is a case in point. If real, they must be internally continuous and hence absolutely rigid. All actual solids are discrete with interstices between the parts; but then, what of the parts? Are there any irreducible parts of matter? Certainly atoms do not at present appear to be impenetrable. The arrow-argument of Zeno and others to prove that motion is not real presents the same sort of a problem. We might further ask whether force, ether, space, time, energy are continuous; and, if not, whether they are discrete. The question as to the exis- tence of other minds, and the question as to the relation of the body to the mind, reduce at last to the old alternative of con- tinuity and discreteness. We need unity, but also variety enough to save us from boredom and unconsciousness. We crave jus- tice, but know that if absolute justice were once established so as to be the natural law of human action, moral experience would cease. At one time, the ideal of scientific exactness engrosses the mind and all effort is devoted to the manyness of the many. At</page><page sequence="9">No. i.] CONSTITUTIVE CONSISTENCE 29 another, we crave system and classification, the reduction of mani- folds to single terms, the arrangement of the many in ordered series. The more continuity we find in nature, the greater the manifoldness of the ends to which she contributes in human ex- perience, the greater our freedom. The more unresolved dis- creteness there remains in nature, the fewer the ends to which the will is limited. And yet, in a world of dead monotony and sameness, a world without problems, the will would languish. There would be no more thrills and excitement. If we look for other instances of the demand for consistency and self-maintenance among the constitutive forms of the world, perhaps the most obvious is that existence at large is a contin- uous manifold, is in fact no other than the self of the world as a whole. Discontinuous existence and discontinuous self are self- contradictory terms. The judging function demands this con- tinuity as its necessary background. Existence has no gaps or chasms. The effort to think of a time when there was nothing, or a time when there will be nothing, involves the same weird paradox as the effort to think of any particular thing, say this mountain, or this government, or this mind, as nothing or com- ing from nothing. Nothing and non-being, as St. Augustine contends, prove to be something, namely, the absence of the particular thing whose negation we strive to represent. ' In the beginning God created all things out of nothing'; but the nothing was, it existed. What each thing really is, it is uncon- ditionally, continuously.' Things, on the other hand, are superficially discrete. Each is an irreducible unit. Science tries to discover in this discontin- uous world of things some principle of continuity. There must be such, as in any other case all the continuity would be sub- jective (a mark of self); all the discontinuity would be objective, 1 An interesting application of the principle that, from its own point of view, everything is continuous, is to be found in Lincoln's Inaugural Address of March 4, i86i. Speaking of the perpetuity of the Union he says: " Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination. Continue to execute all the express provisions of our National Consti- tution and the Union will endure forever -it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself."</page><page sequence="10">30 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVI. and their union in experience an absolute mystery. We relate object to object in continuous time, space, likeness, genesis, causation, ownership, purpose, energy, ether, government, mo- rality, beauty, and so on, to fill in the gaps. Existence must have a continuous content corresponding to its own continuity. Herein lies the assurance of science and the motive of all her efforts to understand. To the metaphysically inclined, on the other hand, existence must somehow possess all the variety of its content; and the effort to derive a manifold world from a barren existence has failed again and again. Back of all science and all metaphysics is the certainty that every object of thought must satisfy the paradoxical demand of consistency, viz., that it be both continuous with all other objects of thought and yet dis- tinct and separate from them. The attention lives in rhythms to which the objective manifold corresponds, but beneath attention is the universe of immediate existence. It continues in the vague self-awareness of feeling, when attention shifts. When the light of attention wanes, things pass into a realm of shades where they await a resurrection. The one abides, the many come and go. The many, as functions of past activities and present organization, are given; the one is prospective and demanded. Continuity is the assimilation of the object to self, the projected shadow of the self; discreteness is a function of organization and technique. The mind is not satisfied with either way of taking objects. From the manifold facts of the world, we pass to that continuous system of laws or principles in which and for which facts exist. Fiirsichsein is continuous, Fiiranderssein is discrete. From its own standpoint everything is continuous. It is self who sings: "They reckon ill who leave me out; When me they fly, I am the wings; 1 am the doubter and the doubt, And I the hymn the Brahmin sings." Discreteness arises from that impersonal technique which distin- guishes science from speculation and that which is from that which is to be. But we have seen that mere discreteness is mere confusion. Self-maintenance does not demand that. Accordingly, all real</page><page sequence="11">No. i.] CONSTITUTIVE CONSISTENCY 3 1 manifolds are ordered, and we shall do well to give some further attention here to the concept of order. Order is the form of con- stitutive consistency which makes those substitutions of contents possible upon which the complex experience of man and all the higher attainments of mind depend. Order and substitution con- stitute intelligibility and intelligence. Order is not necessary to the concept of manifoldness, but a manifold without order can- not exist. Even the contents of a dump-heap must take some order. Orders are of many kinds, one of the most striking and fundamental being that which existence itself takes on in reflec- tion. We have seen that existence is a continuous manifold, infinitely divisible and of such nature that any point in it divides the whole into two mutually exclusive parts. Its order is always simple; there is but one way to pass from any point in it to any other, namely, forward. No point can occupy more than one position here, and no points or parts can be interchanged. Each point has only the significance of its place before its successors and after its predecessors in the manifold. Of course this order is time. If we make the succession of moments in time corre- spond to some uniform movement in space, we establish a useful periodicity and measure of what we call the same or equal periods of time. Really, no two periods are the same, however useful it may be by social agreement to so regard them. When we represent time by a line, by the uniform flow of water in a stream or a fountain, by the motion of the hands round the dial of a clock, by the flow of sand in an hour-glass, by the movement of a shadow over a plane, and so on, such correspondences make possible certain conventional substitutions of vast importance. Immediate experience gives us no means of measuring time, as the present of immediate experience may be a minute, a day, a decade, or ten thousand years, according to the donation which gives unity to the thought. The measurement of time rests upon the convention of letting the uniform movement of a body cor- respond to the passing of time, and this also is a form of self- maintenance or consistency. Just as existence takes on the time order, so things as inde- pendent contents take on a space order. Time order, as we have</page><page sequence="12">32 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVI. seen, is not reversible; it is not necessary to the universality of existence that it should be so. The universality of an object, how- ever, implies a reversible order of infinite directions. We must be able to approach and leave an object from an infinite number of other objects or contents. This means direction, position, distance (relative terms, all of them),- in short, space. The space mani- fold is primarily an order merely. As a social, public thing, it becomes a filler-in of gaps, a continuum. Time is a simple order, but an infinite number of ways leads from point to point in space. A single point suffices to divide the temporal order, while only a line can be so divided in space. A line-will always divide a surface and a surface a solid, but there is nothing in time to corre- spond to these determinations. All orders seem to be alike in one important respect, namely, they can always be increased by the addition of one more unit to the manifold, and the method of this increase is for each order constant. By a certain determination, time becomes a minute, by another, a second, and so on, and these determinations are always possible. They are not negations, as Spinoza would have said, so much as similar transformations, in the mathematical sense of the word. The generative formula, x + i, may be said to be the law of all ordered series, the key and the symbol of intelligence, provided it be understood that i is related to x by a similar transformation. The process of ordering objects in classes according to like- nesses and differences, putting the classes into subsumptive re- lations of genera and species, is another of the fundamental forms of constitutive consistency. Each class as a whole corresponds to each of its members, so that we may do with each what we can do with every other, and do it far more conveniently than, without the classification, would have been possible. What, then, after so many centuries, is the relation of the universal to the particular? Universalia ante rem, universalia post rem, universalia in re, realism, nominalism, conceptualism, modified realism, modified nominalism, etc., - how the phrases awaken echoes of long ago! How heroically they were raised there, the battle cries of legions of devout men! How our man-</page><page sequence="13">No. I.] CONSTITUTIVE CONSISTENCY. 33 ners and institutions have been affected by them! The medieval church strove nobly to make its relation to its members one of correspondence. Strange that she should have conceived the relation so vaguely! Time is related to this moment, tree to this tree, by a transformation made possible by the organization of reflective experience and realized in judgment and action. These correspondences make possible the substitutions which econo- mize the energy and conserve the freedom of the individual. Whenever a given manifold has been made to correspond to the series of rational numbers, it is possible to use the numbers in either of three fundamental senses, the ordinal, the cardinal, and the multiplicative. Each number defines the place of its corresponding element in the series as a whole, the extent of the series up to that point and the number of times a given unit is taken to produce the series. It is always possible, by taking any one element as a conventional unit, to measure the entire mani- fold by it. All measurement rests upon conventional standards chosen for their convenience. This completes the elements of quantity and shows the method of its determination. But a manifold may vary from point to point in either of two ways. The variations may oley a definite law, or they may not. In the former case, we can calculate the quantity of vari- ation from a given standard at any given point in the manifold, and this gives us degree of intensity and extension. This is the type of all ordered physical manifolds. These are of such a nature that transitions from point to point are mediated by a series of intermediate points, none of which is distinguishable from its predecessor. Degree A may be indistinguishable from degree B, and B indistinguishable from C, while degree A is clearly distinguishable from degree C. In such cases A = B, and B = C, but A &lt; or &gt; C. The contradiction between these judgments and the law that things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other, is the chief motive for construct- ing the continua of quantitative science. Quantity is expressed by the cardinal function of numbers; degree, by their ordinal function. Quantity and degree differ in that a quantity can be divided into equal parts which can be</page><page sequence="14">34 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. recombined in any order we please without changing the original quantity, while the order of the parts of a manifold which varies regularly in degree cannot be changed without destroying the original order entirely. Two or more things are said to be equal, when they may be substituted for each other at will, when they perform the same functions. Evidently they are never equal in all respects, as in that case they would not be two things at all, but would be identically the same thing. Things are equal only for some pur- pose, and from some particular point of view. For the sake of clearness, the term is usually confined to quantitative substitu- tions and used figuratively in other cases. We may define substitution by observing that we can substi- tute whenever we can do with the elements of one manifold what we have done with the elements of another, whenever the one will serve in the fulfillment of the same purpose as the other. The letters of the alphabet may be combined in ways correspond- ing to the combinations of sounds in speech. One may arrange tickets to correspond to the seats of an auditorium, and may then do anything in the distribution of the tickets which might have been done in the distribution of seats, and do it far more conveniently. A ledger record corresponds to the incidents of a day's business; and for certain purposes the record is an eco- nomical substitute of great value. Science arranges phenomena of nature and history in groups according to the presence or absence of certain characters, and proceeds to substitute these characters for the members of the groups. Of any object we predicate all the characters of its group. Heat, light, elec- tricity, gravity, elasticity, etc., are forms of motion, and we pro- ceed to predicate of each whatever we know of motion. Science may learn to resolve one of these forms into another ad libitum, and there will then remain nothing to be accomplished in the way of establishing correspondences and discovering constitutive consistency. In general, the ideal of the rational movement in modern phi- losophy was to be able to start from any content of experience, and, following its implications as cues, to reconstruct reality.</page><page sequence="15">No. I.] CONSTITUTIVE CONSISTENCY. 3 5 Such an ideal presupposes unbroken continuity in nature and a knowledge of the relations of the continuous to the manifold everywhere. It assumes the truth of Hegel's dictum that the real is rational. It would lead us afield to discuss this dictum here. From the standpoint of this paper, the rationalist's ideal is merely an ideal, a pilot star. Reality is essentially a self-maintaining sys- tem, not a finished and completed thing. Within it conflict and discrepancy are always to be found, and it is not conceivable that the work of reorganization and readjustment should at any time be complete. In some of its aspects, in view of its necessary manifoldness, the world is multitudinous. The rationalist's world is no more needed by the mind than the empiricist's. It is as essential to the maintenance of reflective experience that the world should be discrete as that it should be continuous. Whether we insist, with the radical empiricists, that discreteness is funda- mental and continuity derived, or, with the idealists, that con- tinuity is fundamental and discreteness derived, in either case we miss the truth which develops from a critical study of reflective experience, the truth of consistency, that the one and the many are in the same sense real. A word further needs to be added regarding causation. It has been said that this is a volitional category, but there are aspects of the causal order which are presentative and constitutive rather than purposive. We have already found a correspondence be- tween cause and effect such as the constitutive law of continuity in discreteness would lead us to expect. This is formulated in the law of equivalence, and is a structural feature of the world of changing objects. Moreover, the temporal aspect of the causal relation formulated in the law of invariable sequence is constitutive rather than purposive, a demand of thought and a form of continuity. Causal relations are no more given in ex- perience than objects are given. The sequences in the world present gaps and chasms which the mind is constrained to bridge by causal relationships. Change is as characteristic of the world as permanence; indeed, it is more characteristic, and causation is only the consistency of change. The conception of nature as a closed system of causal processes and that other conception, to</page><page sequence="16">36 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. which this in connection with the law of equivalence gives rise, that the sum of all the energies of the universe is a constant, are rationalistic formulae which are not necessary to the conception of an objective world. The law of equivalence is necessary; and it is, moreover, a generalization from experience. But the view of nature as a closed system, the dogma of conservation which rests upon it, and also the law of equivalence, are not laws in the strict sense of the word and do not rest upon experience. They are useful postulates or premises of certain branches of speculative physics, and are rather purposive than constitutive. The purposive aspects of the causal nexus and of nature in gen- eral can best be treated in another connection. They have to do with the world as a whole, with the world as an individual, and raise the question whether the world is infinite. In what sense, then, is infinitude a constitutive form of consistency ? The infinite is defined in two ways in both mathematics and philosophy. Negatively and empirically, it is the unending, the unlimited. In this sense, it is not fundamentally distinct from the finite, it is an unending finite. The other is Dedekind's defini- tion. " A system is said to be infinite when it is similar to a proper part of itself: in the contrary case it is said to be a finite system." "The systems R, S are said to be similar when there exists such a similar transformation sp of S that p(s) = R. According to this definition, all manifolds produced according to the formula x + i are infinite. Upon any series of rational numbers beginning with one and containing n terms, we can always perform the operation indicated in the formula + i so that a new member of the series results. The series is therefore infinite, because it is similar to a proper part of itself. The sys- tem of rational numbers has no last term. Moreover, we can construct infinite systems of rational numbers by simply trans- forming the rational system as a whole into similar systems. Space and time are thus infinite. They are continua of such nature that beyond any limit you please a further space and time are implied. Let the unit be what it may, the operation + I or X 2 can always be performed on any series or sum of such units and the limits of space and time be thereby extended.

The oper- ation x 12 is always possible, no matter how far the process of bisection may have been carried. The same is true of series of similar objects; there is always room for one more in the series. There may always be another man, another tree, or another star, just as there may always be another whole number or another unit of space or time. The manifold objects of the world thus of themselves fall into an infin- itude of infinite series with infinite possible relations of corre- spondence between them. The work of the intellect in discover- ing such correspondences is not likely to be finished inside the life-time of any particular generation. Indeed, there will always remain as much yet to be done as at the moment when human reflection began. We may make similar observations as to causal series. The connotation of any causal law is finite; its denotation is infinite. There may always be another transformation such as that de- scribed. The process Sp in Dedekind's formula is always pos- sible. The world thus appears to be a self-transforming, self- maintaining system, which is always similar to a proper part of itself; and this is one of the deeper meanings of the law of con- sistency. In the case of ordered manifolds of the reversible type, consistency becomes infinity, and in the non-reversible type, eternity. The infinite, the infinitesimal, and the eternal are simply the ' what,' the prospective reference of the particular. Prospective space and time must consist with the orders with which experience makes us familar, and upon this basis we con- struct the definitions, axioms, and operations of geometry and number. In all the natural sciences of the present day, great emphasis is put upon exactness, meaning by the term a com- plete enumeration of the conditions under which a given law is valid, that is to say, a complete definition of the transformation y of Dedekind's formula. This being given, the law holds with the same uniformity and infinite applicability as the axioms and postulates of geometry. Thus we construct 'exact' sciences, and thus we may say that what a single object and the world of objects really are, they are eternally and immutably. The prin-</page><page sequence="18">38 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. ciples of the indestructibility of matter and the conservation of force and energy express the necessity that the world of objects be, in this sense, infinite and eternal. In the distinction between ' this' and ' the rest of the world,' the latter is always infinite in the sense in which the term has been defined; and it may mean either the future and other existence of ' this ' or the existence of other contents. No object is given as an object, and just as little is the world as a whole so given. They are always to be found, to pass hither from a realm of gray abstraction and antici- pation to warm and actual immediacy. Their infinity lies in the fact that they always may thus pass hither. We have now developed the concept of constitutive consistency and found it to contain three demands, three necessary forms of the objective contents of experience. These we may name con- tinuity, discreteness or exactness, and completeness. The first has proved to be order, and all genuine orders seem to sustain what might be called relations of one to one correspondence to their members. Each order appears to be similar to a proper part of itself. We have found that orders correspond in this fashion to each other. All thinking is a process of establishing correspondences. What the intellect seeks is not identities and differences, as scholastic logicians held, but correspondences; and we need this type of relationships, because it makes possible certain processes of substitution which economize the attention and energy of the individual in the further activities of life. Completeness or individuality is such a relation of continuity to discreteness in the object of thought as to make the latter self- maintaining and infinite. Completeness is continuity in discrete- ness 'of the type we have described as infinite. A complete thing is not an object cut off and isolated, not the 'flower in the crannied wall,' 'root and all and all in all,' but rather a complex which involves no self-destructive internal discord. Complete space is not to be conceived as all the space within a given or conceivable limit,- that is self-contradictory,- but rather such a space experience as may continue without let or hindrance from within. Complete space is Euclidian, it is also non-Euclidean; it is both tri-dimensional and hyper-dimensional. Complete space</page><page sequence="19">No. i.] CONSTITUTIVE CONSISTENCY 39 is any space possessing such internal harmony as to be infinite, that is, similar to a proper part of itself. Similarly, complete classification or description is not to be conceived as such an enumeration of attributes and relations as shall leave none remaining to be mentioned. That is as self- contradictory a conception as an all-comprehending space. It is rather a classification based on continuous principles of order such that further characterization may be reached by a process like the similar transformation of which we have spoken. Com- pleteness, the conception of objects and the world as wholes, is in some of its aspects a purposive category, a demand for economy in thought, for simplicity in the conditions of further activity. There are certain other orders such as those of economics, ethics, aesthetics, and metaphysics, which are not constitutive as continuity, discreteness, and completeness are, orders which are predominately practical or purposive. To them we may return at another time. G. A. TAWNEY.</page></plain_text>
