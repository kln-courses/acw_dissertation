<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fairness, Utility and Survival RICHARD L. TRAMMELL and THOMAS E. WREN In 'The Survival Lottery',1 John Harris invites us to consider a system whereby certain innocent persons, who will die unless they receive organ transplants, are saved by killing equally innocent donors selected at random in a computer-run lottery. Since his thought-experiment has important implications for political philosophy as well as medical ethics, it needs to be taken seriously in spite of its seeming fantasticality.2 He runs two separate lines of argument, one an appeal to utility and the other an appeal to fairness. Neither line works by itself, however; and when taken together they destroy each other, as we shall see. Harris's proposal opens with a number of suppositions: that the tech- nology of organ transplantation has been perfected, that two patients, Y and Z, are about to die because the heart and the lungs which they respectively need are not in stock or otherwise available, that neither patient is resigned to being left to die. What they wish to do is to set up a society-wide lottery whereby a donor, A, will be selected by a computer to provide the needed organs. Further-and for simplicity's sake we shall not contest this assumption here3-Harris assumes that there is no morally relevant difference between killing and letting die. A, Y and Z are all innocent; and we have the technology to decide which two of the three will live. Any appeal to the principle of non-intervention mistakenly attributed to A. H. Clough4 seems to be a denial of our responsibility to decide who will live, and simply to beg the question as to whether A has Philosophy 50, No. i9i (January I975), 8i-87. 2 Or as Robert Nozick puts it in a related context, we need to consider such questions in spite of their sounding 'slightly hysterical'.

Trammell's article, 'Saving Life and Taking Life', Journal of Philosophy 72, No. 5 (I3 March 1975), 131-I37. 4 Like most others who cite it, Harris ignores the bitterly ironic context in which Clough's famous line appears: Thou shalt not kill; but need'st not strive Officiously to keep alive.

Harris argues that such a lottery would not create the pervasive insecurity one might expect, since in a large society, as long as strict impartiality is preserved, 'ex hypothesi each person would have a better chance of living to a ripe old age if the lottery scheme were to be implemented' (p. 84). The lottery, then, is apparently justified both on utilitarian grounds-more lives are saved-and by considerations of fairness-no one is discriminated against. Except for 'practical diffi- culties', Harris sees no moral reasons, but only cultural prejudices which probably could be erased over time, for rejecting such a lottery. I. A Disconcerting Consequence of the Lottery According to Harris, Y and Z are in their desperate condition precisely because 'there are no spare organs in stock' (p. 8i). Since the technology of organ storage is obviously commensurate with that of transplantation, it seems clear that he is advocating the lottery only as a back-up system to the primary system of a society-wide general organ bank, versions of which we have even now, albeit only on a voluntary basis and for only a few organs. Obviously before we kill innocent people by lottery or any other means, we would make full use of organs from the dead, with or without permission from relatives. That the survival lottery is meant only as a back-up system to the primary system of the organ bank makes the lottery seem less outrageous-extraordinary circumstances might justify such extraordinary measures. All this seems reasonable enough. But notice the rub. Once both systems are in effect the only people who will die will be unfit donors for the organ bank, i.e. people (usually very old) whose overall condition has deteriorated drastically and irreversibly. To be a really terminal case would mean that all one's vital organs were unfit for donation to the organ bank, since otherwise one could be treated by either the primary or the back-up system. True, there would be some cases in which the brain was destroyed without all other organs being destroyed. Still, the back-up system would destroy the primacy of the organ bank. Non-lottery contributions to the organ bank would become ever more sporadic as the lottery became established, with the result that the primary system would wither away, like Marx's State. This ironic consequence may not by itself invalidate Harris's arguments; but it does expose the full significance of his proposal, viz. that the survival lottery would become the ordinary, not an extraordinary, source of transplanted organs. The fact that the lottery would swallow up, and not just supplement, the practice of organ banking, undermines any argument (such as Harris's) which begins with the assumption that the lottery would be only rarely used. 332</page><page sequence="3">Discussion 2. The Redundancy of the Lottery Harris's survival lottery is to replace what John Rawls has called the 'natural lottery' of physical circumstance. Admittedly the idea of Nature's holding a 'lottery' is anthropomorphic; but it is easy to replace the term 'natural lottery' with less picturesque, more formal expressions such as 'natural distribution' and 'natural system of undeserved inequalities'. Still, the former expression is also appropriate because in the natural distribution something very much like a game of chance or luck is opera- tive, to the exclusion of anything like earning or desert. Even Harris acknowledges this concept of 'natural fortune' when he characterizes the refusal to adopt the survival lottery as 'a decision to prefer the lives of the fortunate to those of the unfortunate' (p. 8i). From the perspective of those who win in the natural lottery, Harris's proposal will seem like a needless replay of an already impartially played lottery. It is true that Y and Z have lost in the natural lottery. But if their losing gives them the right to call for another lottery, it is difficult to see why the losers in this new lottery could not call for still another round on the ground that now they are the unfortunate who are under sentence through no fault of their own. And so on indefinitely and absurdly. Hence the present objection, which is an appeal to the principle of economy (Harris is needlessly multiplying lotteries), can also be regarded as a reductio ad absurdum to the effect that, once begun, the survival lottery leads to an infinite regress of distributions that need to be set right. 3. The Alleged Fairness of the Lottery Even if we assume that a society-wide survival lottery would not be redundant in the sense just argued, it does not follow that it would be any more fair than the original, natural distribution. We can see this by con- sidering a logical extension of Harris's thought-experiment. It seems indisputable that if the natural distribution of organs is unfair, it is unfair all through life and not simply when one is about to die. For example, suppose that for the past twenty years Y's poor heart has pre- vented him from skiing, and that Y has been miserable about this. But A's heart is strong and A skis to his heart's content. Surely if Y has a legitimate complaint, he has had it all through his life, and not just when he is about to die. The essential point is that a person's opportunities in life are closely connected to factors (especially genetic factors) that are totally beyond his control. In so far as health is determined by genetics, those with healthy bodies do not deserve them, nor do those with unhealthy bodies deserve them. Would it not be possible to rectify this situation by setting up a completely impartial lottery wherein every person, not just 22 333</page><page sequence="4">Discussion dying patients such as Y and Z, has an equal chance to obtain the best bodily organs? There are severe complications in trying even to imagine a complete society-wide redistribution of organs, because of age incompatibilities. But we can make our hypothetical case more manageable by limiting the use of a lottery to each new crop of babies. With super-technology, the hearts of all or nearly all babies might be interchangeable; thus with each new crop of babies, we could introduce a virtually complete redistribution of hearts, as well as other vital organs. The question is, would we have gained anything so far as fairness is concerned? We are still left with the same number of good hearts, medium hearts, and poor hearts; and we are still left with a situation in which no one has done anything to deserve the heart he receives. It is true that if a child asks, 'But why should I be the unlucky one with this poor heart?' we will give him a different answer than we do now. Instead of saying that his heart's condition was determined by natural chance (the genetic roulette wheel), now we will tell him that his heart's condition was determined both by natural chance and by a man-designed lottery. We might even have to say: 'The heart your parents originally gave you was a good one; but it was not fair for you to have this heart without giving anyone else a chance. In the lottery, you had as good a chance to draw this heart as anyone else did; so you have no grounds for complaint.' It is by no means clear that this reasoning either would or should be convincing to the child. Since the sum total of undeserved inequality remains the same, why should the new distribution of inequality be any fairer than the original distribution? Against this argument Y and Z might object that a man-made lottery is a process of 'pure procedural justice' and that by definition whatever the outcome of the lottery is, is fair.5 This objection might be plausible in a situation where all the involved parties voluntarily agreed to this method to solve a problem of distribution of scarce resources. But in the lottery described above, as also in that described by Harris, there is no option for all the parties involved to participate voluntarily. An effectively enforced artificial lottery, whether on children or adults, is just as ineluctable as the wheel of nature. Furthermore, if we are going to solve the problem of unmerited distribution by definition, why not call the natural distribution of health fair by definition? The distribution by nature has the advantage of being the first distribution; and we can define any existing distribution as fair if the distribution itself was not the result of unjust human acts, and if there is no way to reduce unmerited inequalities without creating new 5 Cf.

The lottery suggested by Harris does not reduce physical inequality at all, but simply shifts it around. There is still another problem with Harris's appeal to fairness. In the example of an infants' lottery mentioned above, we assumed that fairness demanded that everyone be in the lottery, and that the organs be distri- buted by a completely random process. Actually Y and Z do not seem committed to fairness defined in this way, since the instruction they would give to the computer making the selection is to find a 'suitable donor' (p. 83). The requirement of a 'suitable donor' obviously forbids a strictly random selection from the entire population. In effect such a system would be discriminating against the healthy, since only the healthy would be 'suitable donors'. Such a system would follow the manifestly unfair principle, 'Whoever gets sick first, gets to live'.6 To be strictly fair, Y would have to take whatever heart the lottery turned up, even if it were worse than his own. But then this would be no fairer than the original distribution. In short, there is no coherent view of fairness present in Harris's account. Finally, it is worth noting another interpretation of fairness which Harris does not mention and which we shall not evaluate here: namely, real equality of health as opposed to the random redistribution of existing inequalities by lottery. We can imagine a technology which could provide this real equality-say, by redistributing organs in such a way that every- one's (or nearly everyone's) natural life-span would be of the same length, ceteris paribus. Clearly, such a goal, if it could be morally justified, would require us to abandon the survival lottery in favour of the expertise of an incredibly sophisticated technology. 4. The Disutility of the Lottery Thus far we have been considering whether the survival lottery would be fair. Now we will consider what kind of organ lottery, if we are to have a lottery at all, would have highest utility. There are obvious disutilities to a society-wide lottery, among which are the following: the terror involved in the procedure of a healthy person being apprehended and sacrificed to save the sick; the harm inflicted on future generations by sacrificing those who as a class have the healthiest genes for those who as a class have the unhealthiest genes; the danger of abuse in selection processes; and the restriction of free- dom. These disutilities, as well as the cost of maintaining a society-wide lottery, could be largely avoided by allowing voluntary lotteries among the dying. 6 Does Harris realize what Y and Z are really up to here? Apparently not, for he writes, 'The problem of narrowing down the class of possible donors without discriminating unfairly against some sub-class of society is, I suspect, insoluble' (p. 86). 335</page><page sequence="6">Discussion Furthermore, such restricted lotteries would avoid the disutility of having to establish an elaborate and invidious system of exemptions from the lottery. It seems obvious that utility would require some exemptions from any society-wide lottery. It would be an absurdity if the only person who could do the transplant operation was chosen by the lottery, and then was killed, although no one was left who could perform the operation. Just as surely as utility demands that we do not sacrifice any medical person whose presence is essential to the operation (or even to other operations like it), utility also demands that we not sacrifice persons who will make important contributions to society. For example, it would be folly to sacrifice a highly trained scientist on the verge of making a dramatic breakthrough in developing an artificial heart. And it might disrupt an entire political system if in the midst of a hotly contested national election, one of the candidates should be chosen by the lottery. Another utilitarian advantage of limiting the lottery to the sick, if there is to be a survival lottery at all, is that it would eliminate (or at least vastly reduce) the disutility of having to determine responsibility for illness. Harris recognizes that responsibility for sickness is a serious complication in justifying a society-wide lottery: 'There would clearly be something unjust about killing the abstemious B so that W (whose heavy smoking has given him lung cancer) and X (whose drinking has destroyed his liver) should be preserved to over-indulge again' (p. 83). Even a determinist will see disutility in a policy which encourages people to think that if they destroy their bodies through bad habits they will then be able to save themselves by means of someone else's healthy body. Furthermore, the disutility of having to decide who is responsible is not limited to the problem concerning 'who has brought his misfortune on himself'. One would also have to decide who has not brought his misfortune on himself. Suppose that P, congenitally frail, would have had to use the lottery, except for the extremely cautious and abstemious life he has led. It would surely not be a utilitarian policy to select people like P as victims of the lottery, when if these people had been more improvident they would have been able to use the lottery! The responsibility problem extends to the right of parents to plan for their children. Suppose for example that two sets of parents know that they run a serious risk of having a defective child. One set of parents decides against the risk and uses artificial insemination by donor to have a healthy child; the other family decides to risk it and they have a seriously defective child. Surely we would not want to limit our consideration to the children alone and allow (through lottery or otherwise) for the responsible parents to have their child taken from them to save the child of the parents who decided to risk it. This consideration applies even after the children grow up. The Smiths, who have made great sacrifices to provide for the health of their child, will not take kindly to the sacrifice of their forty-year-old 336</page><page sequence="7">Discussion son to save the forty-year-old son of the Browns, who have made very little sacrifice to provide for the health of their child. 5. The Inconsistency of Fairness and Utility The above utilitarian objections to a society-wide lottery will be objected to by Y and Z on the ground that it would be unfair to restrict the survival lottery to the sick. If donors are drawn only from the ranks of the sick, why does this not discriminate against the sick? Why should the sick be the only ones in the lottery-'simply because they are so unlucky as to have diseased organs'? (pp 8i-82). But as we have seen, not even Y and Z are committed to a completely impartial lottery-they want only 'suitable donors' to be included, i.e. donors with strong hearts and good lungs. There is obvious disutility in killing someone with a heart and lungs equivalent to or only slightly better than those of the two people dying. But there is an equally obvious disutility in killing only the healthiest members of society, or in allowing essential members of society to be subject to any such risk at all. It is only because Y and Z inconsistently appeal first to utility, then to fairness, that their proposal has any plausibility at all. What Harris has overlooked is that their appeal to utility is to justify unfairness (i.e. using only suitable donors), and their appeal to fairness is to justify disutility (i.e. terror, decline in genetic quality, immense main- tenance costs, etc.). In sum, the two lines of argument are mutually destructive and not, as Harris suggests, mutually supportive. Grove City College Loyola University of Chicago 337</page></plain_text>
