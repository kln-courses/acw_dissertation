Peter Dance, The Art of Natural History. Feltham, Mddx.: Country Life Books/ Hamlyn, (1978), £22.50. The publication of a fine illustrated work is always an exciting event for collectors, book dealers and students alike. Peter Dance is the leading authority on conchology (shell collecting), and with this book must be established as one of the world's leading authori ties on illustrated works in the much broader field of natural history. The book is actually confined to zoology, and especially the zoology of 1600 to 1900 AD. Thus the work includes wood-cuts, copper and steel engraving and lithography, hand-coloured works and the development of chromolithography. The author and publisher of a book like this face some tricky problems. In partic ular, the balance between text and illustrations is quite difficult to solve. It is possible to allow the text to "lead," placing the illustrations just where it best suits the narrative, reducing the size of the illustrations and reproducing them in black and white. This is an excellent formula for academic works, and there are some famous examples: Cole's History of Comparative Anatomy, Choulant's History and Bibliography of Anatomic Illustration, Diringer's The Alphabet (1st and 2nd editions), and the many works of Agnes Arber and Charles Singer. This is the simplest solution, and from many points of view the best, because the book stays at a manageable size, the text is less fragmented and hence more readable and the price of the book is reasonable — though I should add that when these excellent books go out of print the price does rise — the first English edition of Choulant sold at Sothebys last season for £70! The most extreme alternative is to separate the illustrations entirely from the text, as did Hutchinson's with the third edition of Diringer's The Alphabet. This is a magnificent work, now in two volumes in a nice slip-case; but I find it quite unusable. I always use the second edition in practice — it really is too much to haul out a second volume, look up the index, find an illustration (and one may have to do that several times each paragraph). No, that's not a good solution. The style chosen for Dance's book by Peter Cameron the editor-designer is best known as "coffee-table". It has become the standard format for marketing illustrated works to the general public, and deserves some attention for that reason alone. In the "coffee-table" genre, the illustrations lead, while the text is secondary. First of all, these books are large (sometimes far too large or heavy to be read in an armchair — which in itself devalues the text). The page-size allows the illustrations to be produced in some thing like their original size, and in colour. Nowadays the best quality lithography produces colour of startling verity which tends to push the illustrations forward, often distracting attention from the text. The illustrations do matter a very great deal in a book like this. Most people have</page><page sequence="2">296 not (and never will) see the originals; the reproductions allow these readers to get some idea of the magnificence and subtle artistry of the originals. It may not matter that many readers will not care much or remember many of the points explained in the text. The pictures themselves are exquisite works and have an aesthetic value over and above their practical merit as scientific documents. This goes some way towards explain ing the growth in number of coffee-table books, in spite of their high prices. If, as is the case with Dance, the page layout is varied to suit the particular illustra tions at hand, then much depends on the way the details are handled. The relation between text and illustration in particular must be as close to juxtaposition as is physically possible. Of course, every important point made by the author must be illustrated. This is the weakness of the book. Too often an important work is mentioned in the text but not illustrated at all; for example, on page 19, Megenberg's Buch der Nature is, we are told, the first illustrated book to inform its readers about animals ("a significant event in the history of zoological iconography"). But no illustration is provided. This happens again and again, and it is most irritating. Some illustrations may have been omitted for reasons that seemed good at the time: they may have been thought to be too well-known, or competition for page space may have crowded some out. But that is not the whole explanation; even where the text is supported by an illustration, that illustration is physically separated from the text — sometimes even in another chapter. This is a clear design failure — close integration of text and illustration, which a work of this kind does need, has not been achieved. A complex page-layout is extremely vulnerable — unless the designer is extremely competent and has ample time to get the details right, then mistakes are bound to occur. I sense here the effects of an over-hasty production schedule: just a few months more would have made a wonderful difference. Some subtle variations in the text-illustration battle are worth noting. In particular I like Lysaght's Book of Birds, which has a classic simplicity which other designers might do well to copy. Each two-page spread is a separate unit. On one side is the illustration, on the other side is a discussion of the illustration, the artist and the book. All general discussion is placed in the Introduction. This arrangement makes the page layout simple and predictable. Predictability is actually important for readers, and a merit rather than a defect. The variation of content is quite enough. In this case I feel the Lysaght layout is better than the layout in Dance's book, which is extremely complicated, even bewildering at times. Another work worth mentioning here is Tooley and Bricker's Landmarks of Mapmaking which includes excellent fold out maps (that's a good way to recapture some of the physical size of the original), and some silly "designer's typography" — full pages set in italics with a ragged left edge. That is a good example of the extra freedom of the large page format allowing the designer to show his ignorance of the reader's needs. No discussion of the physical format of the book is complete without a look at the binding. Dance's book is without dustjacket (in the English edition). The spine is flat-backed, and the case is cloth over what are possibly vinyl boards. This style of bind ing gives the book a rather unpleasant feel to the hand, cold and unyielding. This, together with its weight (2 kg) makes fairly sure that if the text is read it will be read on a table, not held in the hand and read in a chair. Also, the flat-spine style is notoriously weak, putting excessive strain on the hinges. Anyone using his copy as a reference work or for detailed study will most likely find the hinges coming adrift inside five years: not a happy thought. Perhaps coffee-table books get less wear and tear than average ; but all in all the bind</page><page sequence="3">297 ing is pretty disappointing and fails to meet the basic criteria of functional or tactile satisfaction. At this price one should get better. What of the content? So varied and wide-ranging are the topics covered by Peter Dance that they defy any simple organization. The method chosen by Dance is to separate the historical narrative (Chapters I—VI) from the four special topics chosen for detailed study (Chapters VII—X). The historical section is strongest, as I have suggested, in the period which matters most (1600—1900), and weakest in the Classical and early Renais sance periods. It is fair to say that considerable specialized scholarship is needed for these earlier periods, and readers interested should consult the works of Cole, Arber, Singer and George Sarton if they wish to explore further the interesting but involved story of natural history illustration in the ancient world. One point which Dance picks up in Chapter II, and returns to several times, is the extreme technical difficulty of combining genuine scientific knowledge and artistic quality. The number of times one human being has mastered a real depth of understand ing of the particular species under study, and has also solved the problems of artistic expression posed by that species, must be numbered on the fingers of two hands. Leonardo, of course, is the obvious example: in his work you can see the process of inquiry at work. That is why his illustrations ring so true. They are science at work, and this is made visible by his splendid graphic facility. However, Leonardo did not publish and so had little effect on the subsequent history of biological illustration. Durer had a great effect, both when he got it perfectly right (e.g., Iiis exquisite stag beetle) and when he got it wrong (his faulty rhinoceros was copied for centuries!). Maria Merian was perhaps the first artist to master the illustration of insects (1714) and, incidentically, the only woman in the front rank of animal artists. The name best known to the public (Audubon) is not held in quite such esteem by afficionados. His designs are so striking — yet the birds have a stagey, slightly unnatural rigidity which betrays his weakness. He made progress, but did not quite master the problem of showing birds in their distinctive behaviours. Joseph Wolf is the man most collectors regard as the finest animal artist. His birds simply look alive; he has achieved that fusion of scientific observation with artistic process so completely that the seams do not show. Wolfs Gyrfalcon stares out from page 128, its soft ventral feathers and its mechanically tough wing feathers so rendered that you sense how it would feel if you touched it; and Wolf could draw mammals just as well as that. Some features of Wolfs life deserve a special mention. He spent many years of his younger life observing animals in the wild (and shooting them, incidentally) and later on he lived near and worked in the London Zoological Gardens. Thus his artistry was always informed by detailed personal observation. He was also a trained artist, attending art school after his great skill had already been recognised. This does help to explain the fusion of science and art in his work. Less obvious, but historically important, he was apprenticed to a firm of lithographers at 16, and his whole career ran parallel to the development of chromolithography. The translation of an artist's drawing into lithography was not a mechanical process. It had to be done by a hand skilled in art and knowledgeable in the new printing process. It was Wolfe's good fortune to have many of his watercolours lithographed by Joseph Smit, himself an extremely fine animal artist. The interplay between the needs of the illustrator and the constraints of the print ing process is well shown by Dance; the text is strong on printing methods, and the captions to the illustrations always give the method of reproduction of the original book.</page><page sequence="4">298 Here is an interesting contrast with Lysaght's Book of Birds. Lysaght usually goes back to the original watercolour, and thus is able to give us unpublished work (such as Wolfe's Shoebills, a luminous work of fine quality). Dance almost always reproduces the printed page, complete with creases and faults if they exist. His choice is naturally better for those of us who have an interest in methods of book production, which are after all an important part of the history of natural history illustration. In the second part of his book Dance comes to his four special topics. Chapter VII, "Mirrors to Ourselves," treats the interesting topic of anthropomorphism. Dance has an interesting theory that Audubon's birds suffer from "postures and expressions which may best be described as human ... a rattlesnake is being attacked by mocking birds, two of which seem to be showing human fear while another two evince human determination... . Even the snake glares expressively at one of the birds, and its pupils are shown, quite erroneously, as round" (p. 155). Where, where? you may ask, but as usual the illustration is nowhere to be found. Still, it is an interesting idea, and a novel one, so far as I know. In chapter VIII, "Life! Life! Life!" Dance discusses the question of accuracy and lifelike realism. It is instructive to remember that the development of artistic skill was not slow and progressive; it was erratic, with early peaks and periods of artistic degeneration (this is well shown by the history of herbals). Dance reminds us of the difficulty of draw ing animals in action before the days of photography: there are things even careful observers cannot see without instruments, and the galloping movement of a horse's legs must be the most famous pitfall in the whole field of animal artistry. We owe the solu tion to Muybridge and his camera, and before him no artist gave an accurate rendering. The humming-bird question is still a live issue ; no-one who has seen these aggressive little beasts in action, hovering an inch in front of your nose and clicking territorial threats, will ever think a frozen photograph does them justice. In "Through the Microscope" (Chapter IX) Dance deals with the aspect of natural history which comes closest to the concerns of the working scientist. Leeuwenhoek, Hooke and Swammerdam produced remarkable results (the latter two especially), but from the death of Leeuwenhoek (1723), little progress was made until the nineteenth century. Then in 1838 Ehrenberg's "Infusorienthierchen" started a whole generation of biologists investigating protozoa and rotifers. By 1880 the classification of these small organisms was essentially in its modern state. Dance does not deal with the use of the microscope for investigating the structure of tissues, but this was also developing fast. The microscope has remained an essential tool for the biologist, whereas the illustrator has been partially replaced by the camera. This latter transition is not discussed in detail. Dance closes with a discussion of popular natural history (Gosse, Rev. J. G. Wood, Rev. F. 0. Morris and the like). Some of these writer/illustrators were quite proficient, though the long production runs and poor quality-control often lead to an unsatis factory result, at least from the artistic point of view. The cause of this rapid growth in popular book production was the increased earnings of the industrial worker and the almost universal literacy which Britain had achieved by the late Victorian age. Nowadays, the function of these books is partly taken over by television, though sales of "spotter" books to schoolchildren is quite brisk. The book includes a useful appendix on techniques of print reproduction, refer ences, biographical notes and an index. There are some factual errors, but they are slight, and I shall not list them. The book is a great achievement by Dance. It has been</page><page sequence="5">299 selected by the American Book Club, and is already a great commercial success. It will be used by book collectors and dealers and, I hope, by young illustrators and designers who wish to try their hand in this strange land somewhere between art and science. References Arber, A.
