<plain_text><page sequence="1">Charles A. Beard\ the "New Physics, and Historical Relativity » Hugh I. Rodgers* Charles Austin Beard was such a provocative and seminal thinker that the passage of time has increased rather than diminished the interest of social scientists and historians in his work. Several studies have appeared in recent years dealing with the origins and development of his political, economic, social and historical thought. Beard's controversial doctrine of historical relativity received special attention in the works of Morton G. White and Cushing Strout. Both viewed Beard's relativism as an aspect of the "pragmatic revolt" in American thought.1 Certainly the pragmatic and evolutionary traditions are important for the development of relativism in Beard's thought. Carl Becker, whose ideas often anticipated and paralleled many of Beard's, noted in 1910 that men influenced * The author is a member of the Department of History, Columbus College.

Becker indicated that the truth of historical synthesis lay in its usefulness; it was "true relatively to the needs of the age which fashioned it."2 To the relativism of the prag matists a new emphasis was added during the 1920s and 1930s. This new emphasis was on the involvement of the observer with the "facts" observed. The stress on subjectivity was an important contribution of the new physics to the attack on the empirical method in historiography and the social sciences. Writing in the middle of the 1930s, Tobias Dantzig summarized the profound transformation wrought by Einstein in basic scientific assumptions by noting that modern science differed from its classical predecessor in recognizing "the anthropomorphic origin and nature of human knowledge." It was "inherently impossible" to establish "whether any universe of human discourse possessed objective reality" at all. One would never be able to assert that he had "exhaustively determined all (his) limitations and discounted all (his) foibles."3 The new science of Einstein was skeptical of objectivity and frankly admitted the subjective nature of observations and thus of knowledge itself. Cushing Strout has suggested that Charles Beard was not sufficiently aware of these developments in modern physical science to draw support from them in his struggle against determinism and objectivism in historical and social science writing.4 If true, this unawareness seems strange in view of the widespread discussion of the new doctrines. To the disgust of some physicists and the delight of others the theory of relativity provoked "strange speculations" in philosophy, ' Carl Becker, "Detachment and the Writing of History," Atlantic, CVI (October 1910), 531, 535. 3 Tobias Dantzig, Aspects of Science (New York, 1937), 279-280. * Strout, Pragmatic Revolt in American History, 160. 546</page><page sequence="3">Charles A.

He proceeded to apply the new physics to political science with rather startling results.10 Historians were also affected by the new concepts although it required the better part of a decade for Clio's votaries to adapt relativity to historiography. In 1923, Edward P. Cheyney held out to the American Historical Association the hope of an "immutable, self-existent law" in history, but by 1933, Charles A. Beard urged the same body to opt for an "act of faith."11 In the intervening decade historians questioned the idea of law in history, became increasingly skeptical about history as a science, and above all, tackled the problem of objectivity in the writing and interpretation of history. The optimistic trust in "law" collapsed rapidly. Samuel Flagg Bemis defended the old hope in 1926 when he main tained that some "future Newton" would discover a master principle by which to interpret history.12 This appeared a vain expectation as the findings of Einstein, Heisenberg, and Bohr put the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the Rule of Phase, which Henry Adams tried to apply to history, on quite shaky legal legs.13 Sir Charles Oman demonstrated •William Bennett Munro, "Physics and Politics: An Old Analogy Revisited," American Political Science Review, XXII (February 1928), 1-11.

Beard the historian's loss of certainty by declaring flatly that history was "cataclysmic and not evolutionary."14 Carl Becker, who had hinted at the lack of detachment in the writing of history before World War I, provoked a spirited debate among historians. Condemning Becker for holding that historical facts are figments of the historian's mind, Carl Stephenson trumpeted, "No fact, no history!"15 Despite such histrionics the goal of impartiality implied in Ranke's command to write history as it actually happened eluded historians. The historian selected the facts to fit whatever aim he had in mind, James Harvey Robinson announced.18 Harry Elmer Barnes maintained in 1927 that whether one tried to evaluate an historical event in terms of its own age or in terms of the present, "serious distortion" resulted. He found that "tests of the significance of historical material are relative and pragmatic. Is there no absolute and trans cendental test? Apparently not. . . ."1T Confessions of the sin of subjectivity multiplied. Generalization in history was admitted to depend on facts selected by a historian whose attitude, colored by the intellectual climate of his times, governed his interpretation of the facts.18 The papers read at the annual meeting of the American Historical Association in 1927 reflected an active interest in problems of method, relation, outlook, and philosophy of 14 Penrhyn Chave, "The Element of Chance," Nineteenth Century and After, C (September 1926), 471, 472.

Such concepts might not satisfy the spirit of another age, he stated, making the doctrine of relativity itself relative to its historical setting.20 Taylor went on to remark that written history was also a product of the "intellectual conditions (which are the actualities) of the time of its composition." But Taylor did not stop after pointing out the relativity of conditions. He approached a subjectivist position by defining knowledge as experience; each man had a different experience, therefore, different knowledge. This was the disturbing "human equation" which made the study of the facts dependent upon the observer's ability and bias.21 Carl Becker magnified the note of subjectivism sounded by Taylor when he informed the American Historical Asso ciation in 1931 that every man was his own historian.22 Becker's position was pushed to its logical conclusion the next year by Edward Maslin Hulme, who told the Pacific Coast Branch of the American Historical Association that detachment and objectivity in the writing of history was a myth. Not only time and place, but the personal character istics of the historian colored his work. Noting that even physicists now took the personal equation into account, 19 Annual Report of the American Historical Association foi· the Years 1927 and 1928 (Washington, 1929), 30-32.

Beard Hulme concluded: "Historic truth is relative and subjective, not absolute and objective."23 The cause o£ "scientific" history seemed doomed. It remained for the economic historian Charles Woolsey Cole to demonstrate a direct connection between the new physics and historiography. He did so in an essay published in 1933 entitled "The Relativity of History."24 As in the past when Newton and Darwin had provided useful patterns of thought, Cole suggested the time had come once more to draw new points of view from the "austere domain of physics." Cole found in the new physics three principles: relativity, indeterminism, and discontinuity. Upon elabor ating these principles, Cole showed that Einstein had made it clear the physical facts of time, distance, motion, and measurement had no meaning. "They are not absolute. They take on significance only when related to some frame of reference." The same thing was true of historical facts. They are made meaningful "when by order, selection, and interpretation they are related to a frame of reference."25 Facts, in other words, had the meaning which historians bestowed on them. Historians thus moved from absolute to relative truth and from pretentions of detachment to admissions of subjectivity. The debate about the nature of historical knowledge was the context in which Charles A. Beard's doctrine of historical relativity was formed. Naturally, ascertaining just when and under what circumstances an individual develops a particular line of thought is difficult at best.

Beard's associate, James Harvey Robinson, emphasized in 1904 that historical matter could be truly and impartially stated.27 Robinson and Beard hoped to make the morning paper more understandable with their Development of Modern Europe which they pointedly subtitled, An Intro duction to the Study of Current History. But granting that this aim was held, the authors asserted there would be no "distortion of the facts in order to bring them into relation to any particular conception of the present."28 The new history, pragmatic and utilitarian, did not aim at the rejection of objectivity. Beard held that the economic interpretation of history was a most excellent aid in reaching the goal of objectivity.29 In his study of the Constitution, Beard criticized the scientific historians for being overly concerned with mere classifying and arranging of facts. He proposed to explain their "proxi mate or remote causes and relations."30 Beard accepted the causal nature of history while objecting to the narrowness of the Rankean type of history writing.31 Beard was even confident that the historian might discover a law which would " Merle Curti, "Beard as Historical Critic," in Charles A.

He wrote of a fast changing world in which the confusing elements of history constantly evolved "together in terrible fascination."33 The years from 1922 to 1925 found Beard becoming skeptical about the possibility of objectivity when writing about those elements. Instead of brashly talking about explaining proximate and remote causes, Beard now found that selection of material was a most "delicate" matter. "Each of us," he admitted, "must perforce see what is behind his own eyes."34 Beard did not abandon wholesale or at once his attach ment to the old standards. In July 1925, he could still praise a volume for meeting the "requirements of exact science." 35 But in November of that same year he inquired into an author's "philosophy of values" which had determined both what he had included and what he had left out of his history.36 Beard began to deprecate the writer who made pretentions to a "Buddha-like detachment," seeing things simply as they were.37 He now preferred one who applied the standards of his own milieu when making value judg ments. In July 1926, Beard had occasion to make his first direct reference in print to the new physics when he advised historians that research into the origins of World War I would be a complicated job.

He must select a few from the number that had survived the destructive work of time and circumstance. "And any selection," Beard warned, "is an interpretation."39 By the end of 1926 Beard had moved some distance from his pre-1920 position. The historian, he now held, never used all the facts. Those he selected were picked according to the historian's system of values. The philosophy of values in part depended upon the historian's position in time and place. Impartiality in the writing of history was a pretension. Beard's attack on objective history became sharper. It was the individual historian, Beard insisted, who selected, inter preted, and made the facts come alive "for those for whom he is writing in the age for which he is writing."40 The dictum of writing history as it actually happened he blasted as a "clever saying of Ranke's," labelling it the "fruit of vain imagination." 41 He reiterated that it was the historian of a particular time and place who assigned value to the facts.42 The years of the mid-1920s during which the gradual shift in Beard's thinking occurred coincided with the publi 38 Beard, "Heroes and Villains of the World War," Current History, XXIV (July 1926), 731. 30 Eeard, "Time, Technology, and the Creative Spirit in Political Science," American Political Science Review, XXI (February 1927), 7. 10 Beard, Review of The History of British Civilization, by Esme Wing field-Stratford, New Republic, LVII (February 6, 1929), 372. 11 Beard, "Political Science," in Research in the Social Sciences: Its Fundamental Method and Objective, ed.

A new edition of Sir James Hopwood Jeans' The Mathematical Theory of Electricity and Magnetism (1925), the appearance of Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington's The Internal Constitution of the Stars (1926), and two editions of Ernest William Hobson's The Domain of Natural Science (1923 and 1926) are examples of these publications. Beard was familiar with these works. He considered the Jeans and Eddington volumes as belonging to a group of books which had "had the most influence on thought and action during the last half century."43 Beard cited the Hobson book several times in his own study of the nature of the social sciences — a work marking a critical milestone in Beard's development as theorist.44 The Jeans and Eddington books are specialized scientific treatises and are not directed to a popular audience. Both deal with Einstein's work and the relativity and quantum theories.45 Hobson attempted in his volume to explain developments in natural science and theoretical mathematics to the interested layman. Natural science, in Hobson's view, was not concerned with the nature of reality or with schemes of causation and determination. Science, like other branches of knowledge, was subjective. Its data were not absolute fact but consisted of conceptions of phenomena perceived by the senses. Hobson pointed out that whereas in the Newtonian system the scientist described the phenomena of motion by using an absolute frame of reference, in the Ein stein system all frames of reference were "on a parity" thus making for complete relativity.

Russell, after summarizing Einstein's work, remarked that the "old glad certainty" of science was gone. Natural law did not consist of immutable principles but of human conventions and statistical averages. Physicists had demonstrated the absence of causation in the natural world.47 Beard continued to take note of developments in natural science, although he complained in 1931 that physicists resembled Supreme Court Justices in the diversity of their opinions.48 Beard, by that time deeply concerned about the depression crisis, was searching for some illumination "on the strange map of life." He told an assembly of history teachers that year that historians and social scientists were being outstripped in this search by the natural scientists. Jeans had ranged over complex areas of time and space to conclude that the universe consisted, not of familiar New tonian matter, but of pure thought. Whitehead, Beard revealed, had collapsed before God as the "ultimate limita tion," while Eddington had admitted the absence of causality in the material world. The three philosopher - scientists agreed there was a basic reality of some kind underlying the appearance of life, but that it was unknowable for the most part.49 In the bewildering struggle of the Titans of science what " Hobson, Domain of Natural Science (Cambridge, England, 1923, 1926), vi, 21-22, 27, 40-42, 94-96, 180-181, 194, 336-337.

Beard could a mere historian do? Beard queried. "He knows nothing of relativity, electrons, and symbolic logic." But he went on to declare that the only discipline able to shed light on mankind's path was history. History revealed to Beard "contingency, the possibility of choices ever present in the stream of life."50 Beard stressed this point again in 1933 when he emphasized that the events of history, "the unfolding of ideas and interests in time-motion," could never be brought into a deterministic pattern.51 It was therefore possible for man to find a way out of his crises. Beard categorically proclaimed the end of determinism in the social sciences. The bondage of social scientists was the result of transferring to their field assumptions "once deemed applicable to the world of physics."52 Social processes could not be analyzed in the manner of engineering problems. For too long, Beard remonstrated early in 1933, social thinkers had been dominated by the idea that once all the facts had been assembled, conclusions would inevitably flow from them. Boldly Beard challenged, "All the facts? Obviously, an impossibility. The obtrusive facts? Obtruded on whose vision? The important facts? Important to whom and to what ends?"53 The limitations of the observer implied in these last statements came to receive more emphasis in Beard's thought. Early in 1933, Beard decried "the coming crisis in empirical method."54 He found that even in chemistry and astro physics where the observer might be supposed to stand outside the discrete things observed, the scientist brought to his study a set of ideas and emotions which colored his perception of phenomena. Much less possible was objectivity Μ Ibid., 14, 19. 51 Beard, "Written History as an Act of Faith," American Historical Review, XXXIX (January 1934), 225. a Beard, Nature of the Social Sciences, 30 n. 8.

His thoughts are parts of the thing thought about."55 Such statements indicate Beard's deepening concern about the subjective nature of knowledge. The position which historical thinking and social science theory had reached by 1933 makes Beard's famous address to the American Historical Association that year seem anti climatic. Nearly everything Beard said then had already been stated. This is true of his attack on scientific method and Rankean objectivity and of his use of the well-known phrase, "frame of reference." But the address did serve as a fitting denouement to the long discussion about philosophy and method in historiography. Beard called upon his listeners to throw off the shackles of analogies drawn from Newtonian physics and Darwinian biology. At one point he attempted, like Taylor six years earlier, to confound the doctrine of relativity itself. But Beard went on to formulate some of the classic statements of that doctrine. The scientific method was extremely limited and could never produce a science of history. The historian was not a detached, objective observer. In selecting and arranging his facts, the historian was guided "inexorably by the frame of reference" in his mind. This frame of reference included "things deemed necessary, things deemed possible, and things deemed desirable." Within this frame three conceptions of history were possible: history as meaningless chaos, a cyclic interpretation, or, the view that history moves M Beard, Nature of the Social Sciences, 16-17. John Higham concludes that while Beard learned that "many scientists thought of themselves no longer as explaining ultimate reality but rather as operating within sharp observational limits," in the long run, even after influences by European idealists, he "clung to a positivistic conception of knowledge as a structure external to the observer." See Higham, Krieger and Gilbert, History, 125, 127. Robert Allen Skotheim maintains that Beard "emphasized the subjective or relative factors" involved in the historian's work in contradistinction to the real objectivity obtaining in the work of a "true" science such as chemistry. See, Skotheim, American Intellectual Histories and Historians, 99. 558</page><page sequence="15">Charles A. Beard in some direction. There was no test of validity, no inherent logic of the data, to guide the historian in making his choice. The selection made constituted the historian's "act of faith" and conditioned the kind of history he would write.56 Beard's remarks threw into clear relief the gulf which separated historians from those halcyon days when Cheyney could speak of law. The prospect frightened some. The objectivists refused the new teaching and resolved to go down fighting with Rankean colors firmly nailed to the masthead. Beard clarified his position in the resulting con flict.57 He shrank from pushing relativism to its ultimate conclusion. He denied that history was chaos and asserted that there are not "as many schemes of reference as there are historians." Yet Beard would not retreat from his view that the idea of absolute truth in history was an illusion. Above all, Beard rejoiced that the pretension to objectivity had been "wrecked beyond repair."58 Beard was encouraged to reject the theory of mechanistic causation in history because he knew the physicists were no longer sure about causation.59 Contemporary physics, Beard found, was "chary about the use of terms cause and effect." It merely described events in the order of their occurrence.60 What could not be done in the physical could M Beard, "Written History as an Act o£ Faith," American Historical Review, XXXIX (January 1934), 228.

The data of the social sciences, Beard insisted, could not be forced into a "closed circle of deterministic sequences."81 The new science also aided Beard in his search for a solution to the impasse in empirical method. Much of the speculation in higher physics, Beard discovered, was a result of "subjective feeling rather than the outcome of objective observation."82 Modern scientists had unhesitatingly dis missed the old concept of complete objectivity. They no longer believed " 'that the eye of any beholder is disinter ested.'"63 Such admissions of subjectivism by natural scientists reinforced Beard's skepticism about objectivity in historiography and encouraged him in his bold view of written history as the historian's subjective act of faith in the future. There can be little doubt that Beard was cognizant of trends in contemporary physics and of their implications. All the ingredients of Beard's relativism — the attack upon objectivity, the denial of determinist schemes and thereby of a science of history, the frequent use of phrases like "frame of reference" — all point to the impact of the new physics. The very terminology of Beard's statements fits easily into the discourse of modern physics and its popularizers. To suggest that Beard drew upon contemporary physics does not, of course, exclude other and perhaps ultimately more important influences on his thought. The sources of Charles A. Beard's inspiration and even phraseology, how ever, were varied, and in any consideration of his relativism the contribution of Einstein's physics must be taken into account.
