<plain_text><page sequence="1">Crilse de Vers (a Soie):- MNallarmn - and the Scene of Revlslon Matthew Potoisky Despite MallarmCs recognized penchant for reworking in his later years poems written in his youth, there have been no sustained attempts to examine in what ways these revisions, in the light of his poetics of "impersonality," might offer a critique of the assumptions governing variant readings.' For insofar as any notion of the variant relies on the presupposition that the author's manifest intentions underlie any revision, MallarmCs poetic theory and practice, which call for the erasure of such intentionality, should not leave the the- ory of revision unquestioned. This paper will take up the matter of revision in terms of Mallarm6's poem "Quelle soie aux baumes de temps" (1885). The variant, or "original" version of a text is generally said to contain, in a more basic or unelaborated form, the ideas and images which the author, according to well-defined intentions, will develop and perfect in the so-called "definitive" version.2 It may be treated as a draft version which has not achieved the clarity of purpose and organic unity attributed to the final version. Or, if the variant is separated from the definitive version by a substantial period of time (as is true of most of MallarmCs revised poems), critics can com- pare the two texts for evidence of artistic or intellectual change, linking each version "horizontally" to other contemporary works by the artist, or to current intellectual trends. In either case, the vari- ant is figured as a way to reach the origin, biographical or formal, of the definitive version. The earlier text, like the early work of the artist, may be seen as a skeletal outline of the completed text which supersedes it; or it may serve as an "x-ray" that can illuminate the MLN, 110 (1995): 711-738 ?) 1995 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">MATTHEW POTOLSKY 712 inner workings and organizational scheme of the more complex and organically unified definitive text. One thus examines variants for the "embryonic" or foundational sense that they have in com- mon with the later revision, for clues aiding in the elucidation of obscurities and difficulties which characterize it. The first version, whatever its particular artistic or intellectual merits, is subjected in the light of the later version to a kind of retrospective teleology which alone can make the first version properly "first," that is, can see it as somehow lacking in relation to a more complex later ver- sion. Texts that were never revised or rewritten can be considered complete and self-contained, as opposed to those that, having been subject to new configurations, are considered essentially open and incomplete. The variant stands as the "simple" predecessor to the "complex" definitive text. Yet the other side of this equation is a praxis of reading which, seeking the "grand" ideas behind the spe- cific words, will go back to the "original" conception of the work for the basic notions that inform its completed state.3 Complexity, which in one sense suggests greater sophistication and depth, here becomes primarily ornamental, a supplementary addition to the stable themes and conceptions motivating all versions of the text. This double gesture toward poetic complexity characterizing most analyses of revision raises a crucial issue. For any study of variants relies on the assumption that something essential and un- changing may be passed from text to text, something that "survives" even extensive revisions and rewritings. Such an assumption allows one to claim that an earlier work is a variant of a later one, that the textual particularities differentiating any two or more works are chiefly incidental to their deeper and presumably motivating sim- ilarities. These similarities (for example, the recurrence of themes, a consistent imagery, or a common title) would point to a singular intention on the part of the poet to carry over some essential theme or idea, an intention that would presumably inhere in all states of the text despite, and in fact because of, any linguistic or rhetorical changes. It would further suggest the possibility that a theme could be carried from one context to another without any essential change in sense.4 The example of Mallarme presents, in this respect, something of a limit case. For with Mallarme's revisions, there is the additional complication of the "metaphysical crisis" of the 1860s and 1870s, from which he emerged, it is said, with a notion of "pure" poetry.5 Many of Mallarme's most important late poems are in fact reworked</page><page sequence="3">M L N versions of pre-crisis texts, presumably revised with the intention of bringing them into line with his new poetic vision. The syntactical and semantic difficulties introduced into these new versions are thus analyzed not simply as improvements, but as expressions of a theoretical conception. And it is this conception that has for the most part occupied critics. "Mallarme's revisions," writes Barbara Johnson in this regard, "are read as tending toward a refinement of style through the gradual suppression of reference and historicity, a transposition of fact into idea, with idea the valorized term" ("Eras- ing" 58). In the interpretive scheme Johnson describes, a scheme that characterizes Mallarm6's revisions as increasingly hermetic and idealistic, the poet's theoretical vision comes more and more to determine the shape of his poetic works. The idea, in other words, embodied in a stable thematic order and disassociated from refer- ence and materiality, would seem to be the central issue at stake in the reading of Mallarme's variants. Yet it may be asked whether this "version" of Mallarme can offer a complete or even an adequate account of his late revisions. For the very poetic theory that informs most readings of Mallarme's poetry also explicitly questions nearly all of the grounds by which a variant relationship may be established. This questioning extends from ap- parently minor details to the most consequential issues of criticism. Many of Mallarme's last poems, for example, suppress the titles he gave to earlier versions. These poems also sometimes show radical changes in vocabulary and imagery, to the point that it is difficult to tell whether they are in fact the same poem. But even more unset- tling to the conventional notion of variants is the challenge that Mallarme's writings pose to any kind of thematic criticism. As a number of critics have suggested, Mallarme's poetic practice often renders dubious the attempt to fix the meaning of any textual ele- ment outside of (or indeed even within) its specific syntactical or- der. Jacques Derrida's critique of Jean-Pierre Richard's influential thematic approach to Mallarme's poetry offers a particularly com- pelling example of the implications of this practice. According to Derrida, Richard's monumental attempt to catalogue Mallarm6's symbolic "universe" runs aground in its structural inability to ac- count for a crucial aspect of Mallarm6's themes. Normally, the liter- ary theme describes a phenomenal entity that, within the context of an author's work, gains an identifiable set of meanings and reso- nances, either personal or conceptual. Such a set of meanings, once discovered, guarantees the stability of a thematic system apart from 713</page><page sequence="4">MATTHEW POTOLSKY any specific textual instantiation. Derrida argues, however, that this definition fails to explain the effects of Mallarme's poetry. Mal- larme's themes, according to Derrida, embody both meanings and practices. The theme of whiteness, for example, "means" milk, se- men, foam, snow, paper and any number of other "white" things; but it also describes the material non-meaning of the white spaces between letters. While this non-meaning is significant, indeed cru- cial to the distinction of any theme, its significance results not from the inherent and transportable idea that it instantiates, but from the material praxis that distributes it throughout the text (252-3). Any purely thematic interpretation of Mallarme's writing, insofar as it assumes the ideality of his themes, cannot account for this pivotal element. The same critique, it might be said, should be no less true of a relationship among variants established solely on the basis of common themes.6 But perhaps the most consequential question posed by Mallar- me's poetic theory turns on the related issue of intention. Nearly all textual criticism relies for the authority of its judgments on an as- sumption about the author's intention. In the study of modern writers in particular, the critic most often (and generally reliably) identifies such intention in the final version of a work actually ap- proved by the writer. This approval would signal the writer's sense that the work corresponds to his or her intentions in producing it. But a central conceit of Mallarme's poetic theory is the poet's reso- lute impersonality in relation to the text.7 Mallarme repeatedly stresses in his later critical writings the word's independence from the manifest intentions of either writer or reader to limit its "play" in the text. "Les mots," he writes in the pivotal essay "Le Myst&amp;re dans les lettres," d'eux-memes, s'exaltent a mainte facette reconnue la plus rare ou valant pour l'esprit, centre de suspens vibratoire; qui les perqoit ind6pendam- ment de la suite ordinaire, projet6s, en parois de grotte, tant que dure leur mobilite ou principe, etant ce qui ne se dit pas du discours: prompts tous, avant extinction, a une reciprocite de feux distante ou pr6sent6e de biais comme contingence. (OEuvres completes 386) (Words, by themselves, arouse themselves at many a facet recognized the most rare or valuable for the mind, center of vibratory suspension; which perceives them independently of their common succession, pro- jected, on the walls of a cave, so long as their mobility or principle endures, being that which is not said of speech: promptly all, before extinction, to a distant reciprocity of fires or presented obliquely as contingency.) 714</page><page sequence="5">MLN Poetry, insofar as it removes language from its everyday instrumen- tal uses, sets words in new relationships, allowing them to rise up "d'eux-memes," without the conscious intention of the poet, whose mind is only the locus of this "suspens vibratoire." The word has a "mobilite" of its own which, so long as it lasts, reflects in its many facets not the poet's specific vision, but rather the other words with which it has been juxtaposed. The poet, Mallarm6 will suggest else- where, must therefore relinquish his exclusive control over the shape and meaning of the text and "cede l'initiative aux mots (cedes the initiative to words)" ((Euvres completes 366), thus banish- ing the hasard of univocal intentions. Mallarme does not suggest that the poem should be unintelligible or entirely "hermetic," nor that it lacks any meaning whatsoever; rather, he insists on a displace- ment of understanding from a strict concern with themes and psy- chological experience to the "surface" of the text, to the play of words and syntactical ambiguities.8 The "purity" of the poem is not, according to this formulation, strictly theoretical. It is not, that is, based on a preconceived or pre-existent scheme, but is performa- tive, arising from the effects produced by the text's specific configu- ration of words and sentences. The final version of such a text would, given Mallarme's claims, lie farthest in its performative ef- fects from the guiding intention of the author. The farther it lies from this intention, the more closely it would correspond to Mal- larme's theoretical ideals.9 While one may question the applicability or even the conceptual coherence of Mallarm6's hyperbolic claims for the independent power of the word, they should not be lightly dismissed either. For if, as generations of critics have argued, Mallarme's poems must be read in terms of his theoretical doctrines, then the consideration of those doctrines should not be abandoned when it comes to the matter of how and why those poems were produced. What, then, might Mallarme's new poetics have to suggest about the reading of variants, most specifically about the variants of his own poems? If Mallarme's conception of poetry renders problematic the notion of a theme or of the poet's "presence" in his text, how is one to under- stand the marked similarities in language and subject matter that link two or more poems? And how is one to read Mallarm6's own revisions of his early works, all of which tend toward greater com- plexity while clearly retaining central aspects of the "original" text? Such are the questions that confront the reader of Mallarm6's sonnet "Quelle soie aux baumes de temps," a poem at least as inter- esting for its complicated textual history as for its artistic or intellec- 715</page><page sequence="6">MATTHEW POTOLSKY tual merit, and as such an appropriate test case. Initially published in its definitive version in the Revue Independante in 1885, the poem is extant in four variant forms dating from the early 1860s. It was first written in 1863 as a rough series of Baudelairean quatrains entitled "L'Assaut" (and then slightly revised and retitled "Le cha- teau de l'Esp6rance"), and later reworked as two poems ("De l'Ori- ent passe des Temps" and "Alternative") composed in within a few months of one another sometime in 1868 and early 1869, and sent by Mallarme to various friends.10 In the most basic sense, what links "Quelle soie" with its four possible variants, is a comparison of, and choice between, a woman's hair and a weathered piece of fabric. This conceit, perhaps most familiar from Baudelaire's "La cheve- lure" (a likely inspiration for the early version), and traced by Rob- ert Greer Cohn back to Ronsard (219), is also found in a number of other poems by Mallarme written during the same period, as well as in "Igitur.""l Despite the many differences in tone and vocabulary among these texts, it is evidently this comparison that is passed as a central theme from the earliest days of the poet's production to his latest and most difficult period. And it is the presence of this theme that presumably marks all of the texts as versions of the same work. Yet there is, I would argue, another way of reading the relation- ship among these poems, a way suggested, even insisted upon, by the 1885 version. To discern this reading one must take seriously Mallarme's claims about the "initiative" of words. Here the inquiry can be restricted to one particular substitution: that concerning the "material" to which the poem compares the woman's hair. All of the versions focus on this comparison. Yet the material itself changes from text to text. In the first two versions, and in the definitive version, this material is called soie. In the two versions written in the later 1860s, the word soie is replaced by etoffe. On a thematic or referential level, this change is not terribly significant: insofar as etoffe is a more general name for a manufactured product often made of silk, the essential nature of the object referred to and of the comparison as a whole remains unchanged, and the relationship among the variants is undisturbed. Given, however, the claims of Mallarme's poetics, the substitution of soie for etoffe in the definitive version must be examined in an entirely different light. For if the poem itself concerns the choice between a piece of material and a head of hair, what is one to make of the choice of the word soie over the word etoffe? To take the question a step further, how does a thematic choice concerning material relate to the artistic choices 716</page><page sequence="7">MLN underlying the revision? Finally, what does the possibility of asking these questions suggest about the place of revision in Mallarme's works, and about the very notion of variants and variant readings? Quelle soie aux baumes de temps Ou la Chimere s'extenue Vaut la torse et native nue Que, hors de ton miroir, tu tends! Les trous de drapeaux meditants S'exaltent dans notre avenue: Moi, j'ai ta chevelure nue Pour enfouir mes yeux contents. Non! La bouche ne sera sfire De rien goufter a sa morsure, S'il ne fait, ton princier amant, Dans la considerable touffe Expirer, comme un diamant, Le cri des Gloires qu'il etouffe. (What silk (perfumed) with the balms of time / Where the Chimera exhausts itself / Is worth the twisted and native cloud (nakedness) / That you stretch out from your mirror! / The holes of the flags medita- tive / Exalt themselves in our avenue: / Me, I have your naked hair / In which to bury my contented eyes. / No! The mouth will not be sure / Of tasting anything in its bite (kiss) / If he does not make, your prince charming / In the expansive tuft / Expire, like a diamond / The cry of Glories that he stifles.) Most commentators treat "Quelle soie" as a difficult, if not espe- cially problematic love poem.12 On the most basic level it seems to present, in all of its versions, the image of the poet looking at his mistress' hair as she combs it before a mirror.13 He compares this hair first to a weathered piece of silk ("soie"; "etoffe" in earlier ver- sions), and then to flags raised outside of the room, apparently as a sign of some military celebration ("drapeaux meditants," "Le cri des Gloires").14 Choosing in favor of the hair, he plunges his face into the "considerable touffe," and either kissing or biting it ("morsure"), stifles either his own cry or a cry from the avenue and dedicates himself to the creation of the ideal poem ("comme un diamant") out of the physical moment. The two versions composed at the time Mallarm6 was working on "Igitur" do not depart significantly from this general model, at least in the quatrains. The poem thus con- cerns, according to most readers and in conformity with all of the 717</page><page sequence="8">MATTHEW POTOLSKY variants, a choice between two "objects": the silk, suggesting both artistic production (in the image of the Chimera presumably woven into it) and public glory (in the martial figure of the flags "dans notre avenue"); and the hair, suggesting sensuality and the natural order ("native," "nue"). These objects, in turn, can be understood as em- blems for the "ideas" of art and sensuality produced through the writing of the poem. The focus on the issue of choice is passed with little modification from the two earlier versions of the text. This is particularly true of the first quatrains of all of the variants, in which this issue is most directly posed. Here, for example, is the initial quatrain of the third (top) and the fourth (bottom) versions of the poem: De l'Orient passe des Temps Nulle etoffe jadis venue Ne vaut la chevelure nue Que loin des bijoux tu detends. (From the Orient passed in Times / No fabric has ever come / Worth the naked tresses / That far from the jewels you release.) De l'oubli magique venue, Nulle etoffe, musique et temps, Ne vaut la chevelure nue Que, loin des bijoux, tu detends. (From the magic forgetfulness has come / No fabric, music and time / Worth the naked tresses / That, far from the jewels, you release.) The definitive version is marked by greater syntactical ambiguity, but this is secondary to the general resemblance between the refer- ential situation of these two texts and of the definitive version. This resemblance extends to the structure and imagery of the quatrains as well. Most of the substitutions can be accounted for according to a strictly referential logic. The phrase, "aux baumes de temps" in the definitive version would seem to be a variation on "passe des Temps" in the first version and "oubli" in the second, as well as the word "venue" in both early versions. The "soie" of the later version, as was suggested above, is an apparently unproblematic substitution for "etoffe" from the two earlier versions. The "Chimere" of the 1885 text could similarly be accounted for as an exoticizing correspondence to "Orient" in the first text and "magique" in the second. The phrase "la torse et native nue" can be explained as a periphrasis for "la chevelure nue" in the two variants. Finally, the "bijoux" of the first two 718</page><page sequence="9">MLN versions would seem to be displaced in the later version onto the "diamant" of the tercets, and replaced by the more symbolically consequent "miroir" before which the poet's mistress brushes her hair. All of these substitutions can be explained in thematic terms without too many complications. In each case the substitutions of the later text are synonymous with or at least broadly similar to the words they replace. The changes would, on the whole, seem to remain essentially cosmetic. Yet this relationship does not exhaust the extent of their effect upon the poem. Indeed, far from being an entirely neutral or "inert" thematic substitution which serves only to elaborate on the "idea" that ties the variants together, Mallarm6's substitution of soie for etoffe thematizes the very possibility of such a choice. This thematization of choice, I would argue, allows another -explicitly self-referential-reading of the poem. Thematically and semantically, the exchange of soie for etoffe has little effect: both terms describe a certain material. Things are not so simple, though, if one considers the materiality of the word, in particular its sound qualities.15 For the word soie is phonologically identical to the word soit. Soit, both as a conjunction suggesting a choice, and as the third person present subjunctive suggesting a probability, a wish or a doubt (the two forms are etymologically identical), exists only within the space of a hypothesis, of alternatives, of a question broadly considered. When the hypothesis is confirmed, the alterna- tive chosen, the question answered, soit of necessity disappears. The very condition of its existence is uncertainty or doubt.16 It exists only in the "betweenness" of alternatives. And insofar as it vanishes when a decision is made, it is, strictly speaking, undecidable. This undecidability of soit is not simply something added to the poem, or a mere play on words, for it parallels the choice that structures the referential situation of the poem. Just as the thematic choice of the poem relies on soie, so every choice relies on soit. Given this homon- ymy, the single substitution of soie for etoffe in the definitive version transforms the first quatrain into a kind of mise en abyme, which exemplifies what it says: a poem about making a choice also pro- duces a potential choice between the sound and the meaning of the word soie. Soie at once "means" fabric and "says" choice. The referen- tial scene of the poem, in this respect, is at once referential and irreducibly self-referential. Indeed, rather than simply revising the poem, Mallarme here stages the very scene of revision, doubling the choice depicted in the poem with a self-referential choice between 719</page><page sequence="10">MATTHEW POTOLSKY words. The diegetic poet's choice between silk and hair (soie and chevelure) is also and at the same time the "actual" poet's choice between variants (soie and etoffe), a choice thematized by the phono- logical identity of soie and soit. The substitution of soie for etoffe in the definitive version of the poem allows a self-referential "play" of language which was not pre- sent in the earlier versions, and as such opens up the possibility of a reading not restricted to a mimetic logic. This change would seem to correspond to the theoretical demands developed in Mallarme's critical writings, which insist on just such a "play." And yet, one could object, despite its apparently disruptive nature the substitu- tion in fact makes perfect sense within the existing theory of vari- ants. Since soie and etoffe name the same object, the exchange of one for the other works in the direction of greater complexity, yet re- mains within an essentially mimetic economy. Soie, in other words, is the better "poetic" term. The new term may complicate the referen- tial situation of the poem, may even render it self-referential, but insofar as the exchange of soie for etoffe is mediated by the object they have in common, this complication can still be seen as a mere addition to the essential idea which underlies them both. The sub- stitution, however felicitous, does not go beyond the mimetic econ- omy which would continue to link the variants. Revision, in other words, remains a process of choosing between clearly defined alter- natives, a process still constrained, at bottom, by thematic concerns. If, however, one takes seriously the implications of the self- referential reading of the poem that the word soie introduces into the definitive version, then another possible economy may be pos- ited. For the self-referential reading relies not on the correspon- dence between signifier and signified (i.e. the word "silk" and the fabric it names) but on the phonetic similarity between two signi- fiers (i.e. soie and its homophone). The word soie, as a variant for etoffe, operates within two distinct economies: a referential and semantically-based economy of similarity; and a non-referential and phonetically-based economy of difference. Within the first econ- omy, soie is related to etoffe by the similarity of their referents; within the second economy, it is related to soit by virtue of its difference from other sounds. The first economy, based on meaning, is supple- mented, in the light of the self-referential reading of the poem, by an economy based on sound. In terms of Mallarme's poetic theory, neither of these two economies would be privileged, for both the referential and the non-referential effects of soie emerge from the 720</page><page sequence="11">M L N "initiative" of the word.17 According to the traditional theory of revision, which is based on stable thematic similarities, only the mimetic, referential economy would pertain to the relation between variant versions; while the non-mimetic, differential economy would belong strictly to the play of sounds within the individual text. The non-referential economy, in other words, could have no significant or serious impact on the process of revision. Yet there is a good deal of evidence throughout Mallarme's writ- ing that raises questions about such an exclusion of the material dimension of words. Many of these writings, for example, thematize the force of precisely those non-referential effects of language deemed insignificant to the process of revision. Mallarm6's poems often crystallize around what Michael Riffaterre describes as "verbal obsessions" (151): words or phrases that insistently and almost ab- surdly impose themselves upon the poet. As Albert Thibaudet sug- gests, these obsessions draw on the most physical as well as the most occult qualities of a word, but never strictly on its meaning: The word, for [Mallarme], assumes an immediate and almost hallucina- tory existence . .. Enveloped in music and mystery, a word often imposes itself upon him not by virtue of its meaning, but by virtue of its material body: its typographical form, its soul, its sonority; or by means of a secret yet more interior, which Mallarme ascribes to the singular concept- empty and familiar-of "hasard." The word simply is, and it legitimates itself, without any other justification, by its very existence. Other words are evoked and the verse, the stanza, the poem all crystallize around it. (218-19) Whether or not this process accurately describes Mallarme's compo- sitional practice, it echoes his theoretical claims about the indepen- dent power of the word. One finds numerous examples of it throughout his poetry and his prose. Just such a process, for exam- ple, shapes the poem "Mes bouquins referm6s sur le nom de Pa- phos" (1887), in which the diegetic poet evokes an entire mythical scene on the impetus of a word he has read.18 It is also the subject of the prose poem "Le Demon de l'analogie" (1864), where the pro- tagonist is haunted by the nonsense phrase "La Penulti&amp;me est morte. (The Penultimate is dead)" He compares the sound of the phrase to a wing gliding over the strings of a musical instrument, and assumes that it points to something forgotten, something "que le glorieux Souvenir certainement venait de visiter de son aile ou d'une palme. (that glorious Memory had certainly just visited with its wing or a palm branch)" (cEuvres completes 272). Although he 721</page><page sequence="12">MATTHEW POTOLSKY continues to search for this memory, the origin (and the result) of his obsession turns out to be of a different order. He soon finds that his reverie was the premonition of a scene before which he finds himself by chance: [C]'est quand je vis, levant les yeux, dans la rue des antiquaires instinc- tivement suivie, que j'6tais devant la boutique d'un luthier vendeur de vieux instruments pendus au mur, et, a terre, des palmes jaunes et les ailes enfouies en l'ombre, d'oiseaux anciens. (CEuvres completes 273) (That was when I saw, lifting my eyes, in the street of antiquary shops I had instinctively followed, that I was before the shop of a lute maker, seller of old instruments hanging from the wall, and, on the ground, some yellow palm fronds and the wings, hidden in the shadows, of an- cient birds.) What had begun as a mere verbal obsession, an unexplained fascina- tion with the sound of a seemingly meaningless phrase, here be- comes the demonic premonition of a tableau that composes itself before the poet's eyes and apart from his conscious intention. All of the apparently incidental associations provoked by the phrase have found an independent material instantiation. Although the poet has attempted to give his own meanings to the phrase, these mean- ings are uncannily supplanted by the impersonal operation of some- thing he describes as an "intervention du surnaturel (intervention of the supernatural)" (CEuvres completes 273). As Ursula Franklin suggests, with this conclusion the prose poem "not only takes the creative process as its theme, but is itself the artistic transformation of the creative process of poetry" (63). The poem both thematizes and enacts the production of a work out of a seemingly incidental verbal obsession. And insofar as the phrase bears no thematic rela- tion to the scene it instantiates, its force pertains not to its meaning, but to the associations following upon its shape and sound. The precedent of "Le Demon de l'analogie" offers support for a reading of Mallarme's revisions that would take into account the shapes and sounds of words as well as their meanings. If, as the prose poem suggests, a "work" may arise out of phonemic rather than, or in addition to, strictly thematic associations, then a revision may conceivably be produced by just the same process. Such consid- erations seemed to govern the substitution of soie for etoffe. In this instance, the phonemic association of the word soie with its homo- phone soit introduced a self-referential supplement to the problem of choice depicted in the quatrains. The sound qualities of Mal- larme's substitutions here complicate but do not seriously disrupt 722</page><page sequence="13">MLN the word's referential function. But the disappearance of the word etoffe from the definitive version might be seen to leave another trace in the poem, one that corresponds even more closely to the example of "Le Demon de l'analogie," and raises serious questions about the status of reference in the poem: etouffe, the final word of the definitive version differs from etoffe by only a single letter and a slight change in pronunciation. This word is not present in any of the variant versions of the poem, nor does it correspond to any particular image in them. Placed conspicuously as the final word in the poem, and in a verbal form that underscores its similarity in both sound and shape to etoffe, this "other" variant might be said to draw on the same "raw material"-the same etoffe-that marked the introduction of the word soie. Yet this revision would operate accord- ing to a different principle, a principle that subordinates meaning and reference to the necessities of a phonological substitution and thematic stability to empty sounds. The substitution of etouffe for etoffe cannot be explained, as could the substitution of soie for etoffe, in terms of a mimetic or even a conceptual exchange. It seems in fact to be an exchange devoid of referential significance within the context of the variants. Despite the lack of any obvious thematic resonances between etouffe and gtoffe, I would argue that the former word can and should be read as a revision of the latter. Such a reading is supported by several crucial changes the definitive version makes to the poem's tercets. These changes follow, much in the manner established by "Le D6mon de l'analogie," from a series of associations related to the word etouffe. As opposed to the self-referential reading of the poem produced by the word soie, this revision would produce a non- referential reading of the poem. In the first instance, soie retains its referential function in the poem, whereas etouffe renders that situa- tion not simply more complex, but wholly ambiguous. Here, for the sake of comparison, are the tercets from the third (top) and fourth (bottom) versions of the poem: Mais tandis que les rideaux vagues Cachent des tenebres les vagues Mortes, helas! ces beaux cheveux Lumineux en l'esprit font naitre D'atroces 6tincelles d'Etre, Mon horreur el mes d6saveux. (But while the vague curtains / Conceal from the gloom / The dead waves, alas! this beautiful / Luminous hair breeds in (my) mind / Hor- rendous sparks of Being / My horror and my disavowals.) 723</page><page sequence="14">MATTHEW POTOLSKY Non. Comme par les rideaux vagues Se heurtent du vide les vagues, Pour un fant6me les cheveux Font luxueusement renaitre La lueur parjure de l'Etre, -Son horreur, et ses desaveux. (No. As through the vague curtains / The waves tumble from the void / For a phantom the hair / Luxuriously breeds again / The faithless glimmer of Being / Its horror and its disavowals.) As even the most superficial comparison suggests, the tercets in both of the early versions are remarkably similar to each other in theme, vocabulary, rhyme scheme and even syntax. The central im- age in both is that of the hair "giving birth" ('"font naitre" and "Font . . . renaitre") to the "sparks" or the "glimmer" of Being ("Etre"). The tercets of the definitive version, however, share no imagery or even vocabulary with the variants (save the "Non!" which begins the ter- cets of the second and the definitive version), the rhyme scheme is different and the syntax much more complex: Non! La bouche ne sera sfire De rien gofter a sa morsure, S'il ne fait, ton princier amant, Dans la considerable touffe Expirer, comme un diamant, Le cri des Gloires qu'il etouffe. (No! The mouth will not be sure / Of tasting anything in its bite (kiss) / If he does not make, your prince charming / In the expansive tuft / Expire, like a diamond / The cry of Glories that he stifles.) These stanzas bear little relation to those they evidently replace. It may in fact be said that only the quatrains (or even just the first quatrain) of the definitive version remain from the earlier states of the text. The changes between the variants and the definitive ver- sion go beyond matters of structure or diction. Whereas, for exam- ple, in the early versions, the poet turns away in horror from the hair or from what it seems to represent, in the definitive version he appears to choose in favor of it. And whereas the final note of the variants is one of horror and disavowal, in the definitive version it is one of "Glory" and achievement. For the majority of critics, this almost total revision of the tercets is chiefly a sign of Mallarme's new poetic creed. In this interpreta- 724</page><page sequence="15">MLN tion, the tercets of the definitive version depict a kiss which causes the "princier amant" to breathe out ("expirer") his "cri des Gloires," and thus to create a work of art ("diamant") from the dematerialized essences of the silk and the hair. The kiss, figured as an overcoming of the problem presented by the initial choice, would suggest the rejection by the poet of the sensual or worldly pleasures in favor of the ideal creation of the poem. The choice enacted in the quatrains resolves itself in a poetic synthesis enacted in the tercets. As Gardner Davies, in a recent analysis of the poem characteristic of much opinion on this topic, writes: In the tercets, Mallarme recognizes that it is his duty as a poet, in confor- mity with the principles of Transposition, to reconcile the two images- at once analogous and contradictory-in a poetic synthesis: the notion of the flags in the passing procession, the martial music which hence- forth expresses associations of heroism; and that of the magnificent hair which represents their disavowal. Mallarme finds this synthesis in the kiss that the lover is about to place in the hair of his mistress. (Mallarme 182) The synthesis, achieved by the essentializing process of poetic "Transposition," would combine in the resulting work the "ideal" attributes of the silk and the hair from the quatrains, producing a pure notion (here, the image of the diamond).19 In this reading, the tercets become a scene of poetic creation: out of the choice presented between silk and hair, the poet forges a dialectical syn- thesis, producing from the materiality of the objects an "Idea." Be- ing the locus of this synthesis, the tercets would depict the logical outcome of the choice made in the quatrains and would be con- nected to them as the result of a poetic development, as the preservation-the Hegelian Aufhebung-productive of the poetic idea.20 But Davies' account of the tercets as the scene of a voluntary poetic synthesis leaves out a significant ambiguity introduced by the word etouffe. For it could be argued the tercets depict anything but a choice, and anything but a synthesis. And even if one grants that the tercets depict a scene of poetic creation, this scene would in no way correspond to the idealizing process offered by thematic readings of the poem. This alternative reading of the scene is signaled by a notable shift in the way the definitive version figures poetic cre- ation. The earlier versions of the poem figure it as a light ("etin- celles," "lueur") produced by the hair, a light identified with Being. In the definitive version, this light becomes a breath ("Expirer"). Inso- far as breath is a common enough figure in the lyric tradition for 725</page><page sequence="16">MATTHEW POTOLSKY poetic inspiration, this shift in imagery could, in and of itself, hardly be called disruptive. The tercets describe the poet/prince charm- ing in the act of breathing out or speaking the poem he would produce ("Expirer . .. Le cri de Gloires"). Breath, in this respect, is productive, a figure for the inspiration the poet finds in his mistress' hair. But the final line of the definitive version-"Le cri des Gloires qu'il etouffe"-also points to another interpretation of the poet's act. It suggests that the poet "stifles" or "smothers" ("etouffe") the cry of glory that he seemed to be breathing out. As such, the poem is only equivocally the product of a breath, and may just as well be the product of a suffocation. The ambiguity of the poet's action under- scores the inherent ambiguity of the word Mallarme chooses to characterize the moment of creation. Like its English equivalent, the French word "expirer," which literally refers to breathing out (from the Latin ex + spiro, meaning to breathe or blow), can also mean to breathe one's last-to die. The cry the poet breathes out is also the cry he kills. And the "morsure" that figures his act of creative synthesis is also, as Cohn has noted (220), a "mort sure."21 In this respect, what seemed initially to be a productive process shows itself to be inextricable from a destructive process, the problem of inspi- ration inextricable from that of expiration, and that of creation inextricable from death. The dialectical synthesis Davies has at- tempted to read into this passage involves not simply a distillation of essences, but a murder. The word etouffe thus renders ambiguous the image of poetic creation depicted in the tercets. On the one hand, the tercets show poetry to be the product of a synthesizing Transposition. On the other hand, one cannot escape the possibility, raised by the image of suffocation, that they also show it to be the product of a senseless death. What might creation have to do with death? Why should the idea of poetic synthesis be shadowed by a murder? While the image of death is common enough in Mallarme's poetry and theoretical statements,22 the word etouffe affects the poem not so much through its thematic significance as through the associations it "arouses" in the context of the tercets, associations largely external to the refer- ential situation depicted there. In this respect, it functions much like the phrase that haunts the poet in "Le Demon de l'analogie." In the prose poem, it will be recalled, the phrase "La P6nultieme est morte" produces a series of seemingly incidental associations, for which the poet offers various explanations. These explanations, however, prove empty as the poet looks up only to see the objects of 726</page><page sequence="17">MLN his associations made concrete in a shop window. Something similar occurs with the word etouffe. Although this word seems to be a wholly a-thematic revision of the word etoffe, a revision produced out of a sheerly phonemic association with the word it replaces, it too turns out uncannily to materialize what seems an incidental association. In this case, however, one must turn from the shop window to the dictionary. Under etouffer in Littre's Dictionnaire de la langue franfaise (a book with which Mallarm6 was very familiar), one finds the fol- lowing illustration for the first heading: To suffocate the cocoons of silk worms [Etouffer les cocons des vers d soie], to place them in a steam bath or expose them to the vapor of boiling water in order to kill the chrysalis, so that the butterfly, which would otherwise result, will not pierce the cocoon in emerging. Pierced cocoons can no longer be made into thread, because, in order to spin them, they must be placed in water where they will float to the surface. If they have been pierced, they fill up with water and sink to the bottom. The word etouffer here corresponds to a process of "textual" produc- tion in the most literal sense, a process which constitutes the basic condition underlying the comparison of silk and hair in the qua- trains.23 Without, in other words, the etouffage involved in silk pro- duction, there could be no soie. This, then, is the conjunction of creation and suffocation made literal. In order to harvest the fila- ments produced by the silk worm in its construction of a cocoon, the producer must asphyxiate the worm just before it turns into a chrysalis, before it is able to break through the cocoon and render the threads unusable for fabrication. It is only by depriving the worm of breath, by halting its metamorphosis, that the fiber can be produced. Silk production thus proceeds by a violent imposition that kills the producer in the interest of the product, and that separates the product from the purposes for which it had been created. In terms of this dictionary illustration, the substitution of etouffe for etoffe, a substitution that challenges nearly all of the criteria by which a variant would normally be determined, nevertheless estab- lishes a conceptual resonance with a thematic aspect of the poem. Yet it is a resonance that composes itself only (following the exam- ple of "Le D6mon de l'analogie") outside of the poem's immediate context. This resonance, I would argue, explicitly marks etouffe as a revision of the word etoffe. For in its incidental association with silk production, the word etouffe has at least as much to do with "mate- rial" as does the word soie. Here, however, the association pertains 727</page><page sequence="18">MATTHEW POTOLSKY not to the thematic status of any material within the poem, but to a dictionary definition. Unlike the substitution of soie for etoffe, which was mediated by a common object, the substitution of etouffe for etoffe seems initially to proceed only on the basis of sound qualities. What mediates the substitution is an implicit analogy between the production of silk and the image of poetic creation. Although this analogy clearly engages the themes of the poem, its relation is meta- phorical rather than thematic, conceptual rather than referential. It functions between the poem and the dictionary, not within the imagery of the poem itself. But if this revision deviates in its origins and effects from the expectations of most textual criticism, it conforms in almost all ways to Mallarme's theoretical claims concerning the relation between the poet and the work. In a celebrated passage from "Crise de vers," Mallarme writes of the poet's disappearance from the "texture" of his work in terms that recall the figure of breath thematized in the tercets of "Quelle soie": L'oeuvre pure implique la disparition elocutoire du poete, qui cede l'ini- tiative aux mots, par le heurt de leur inegalite mobilises; ils s'allument de reflets reciproques comme une virtuelle trainee de feux sur des pier- reries, remplacant la respiration perceptible en l'ancien souffle lyrique ou la direction personnelle enthousiaste de la phrase. (UEuvres completes 366) (The pure work implies the elocutionary disappearance of the poet, who cedes the initiative to words, mobilized by the clash of their inequality; they light up with reciprocal reflections like a virtual trail of fires over precious stones, replacing the perceptible breathing in the lyric inspira- tion of old or the enthusiastic personal control of the sentence.) In the figurative death of the poet described in this passage, one begins to discern a relationship between the poet and the silk worm. There is, it seems, an intimate connection between the "vers" suffo- cated by the silk producer, and the "vers" produced by the poet's figurative suffocation. For the reciprocal reflection of words de- scribed by this passage does not simply replace the poet, but de- prives him or her of breath ("respiration"), turning all personal en- thusiasm (from the Greek entheos, meaning inspired, filled with spirit) over to the play of language. Just as the fabrication of silk requires a necessary sacrifice of silk worms (vers ai soie), so, accord- ing to Mallarme, must the poet make a "sacrifice ... relativement a sa personnalit6 (sacrifice in relation to his personality)" in the act of 728</page><page sequence="19">MLN writing (CEuvres completes 370). And just as the silk worm is killed to free its cocoon from its natural function, so the poet must "die" as an intentional presence within the poem to free language from its instrumental functions. This figurative "death" of the poet, like the literal death of the silk worm, describes an erasure of intention, an erasure characterized here, as in "Quelle soie," by the deprivation of breath. In the context of Mallarme's poetic theory, then, the substitution of etouffe for etoffe is perhaps the most appropriate revision imagin- able. It arises not from the manifest intentions of an author, but from a play of language. And by means of its effect in the poem and the analogy it establishes between the poem and the dictionary, it enacts a model of poetry that minimizes the role of the poet in the production of meaning. What are the theoretical consequences of this improbable revision? I have suggested that Mallarm6's poetic theory and practice insist on an understanding of revision not re- stricted to thematic or referential concerns. The poem, Mallarme claims, gains its power from the play of words, a play which neces- sarily excludes the will of the poet, and relies less on thematic con- sistency than on the materiality of the text. The variations that mark a revised text should thus be seen not only as a product of the poet's initiative, but also of an "initiative" taken by the words themselves. The revisions to "Quelle soie" clearly conform to this model, but they also offer a lesson. For the two substitutions I have discussed tell two conflicting stories of revision. The initial story, arising from the substitution of soie for etoffe, depicts revision as a free choice between alternatives. The second story, however, depicts revision as a threatening, almost uncanny act, in which the author's intentions are, at least apparently, circumvented by the play of words. The co- existence of these two stories within the same text suggests the critical nature of Mallarm6's revisions. The second image of revi- sion, that is, stands not as a model to be followed, but as a critique of the limits placed on poetry by the overwhelming presence of the author. Herein lies Mallarm6's lesson for textual criticism. For Mallarme never simply rejects the notion of authorial intention. His apparent reference to the dictionary is no less intentional an expression of authorial will than his choice of the word soie over the word etoffe. And even the assertion that language has a poetic force of its own merely reshapes, rather than goes beyond, the notion of intention, as Mallarme's often anthropomorphic characterizations of words 729</page><page sequence="20">MATTHEW POTOLSKY suggest. But to say that Mallarm6 does not give up the idea of intention is not thereby to claim that his position is dishonest or inconsistent. If, for Mallarm6, the notion of intention can never wholly be overcome, it can and must be continuously questioned. Although announcements of the author's death may be premature, the authority of the Romantic author-effect clearly lies in state. But while this passing may pose problems for conventional models of textual criticism based on the establishment of authorial intention, the model of Mallarme's revisions in "Quelle soie" suggests that intention need not be the only criterion by which the relation among variant texts may be understood. The work of the textual critic, in this respect, should not cease with the voice of the author or the establishment of a single authoritative text, but should attend as well to the complicated relationships between the various states of a text and among the many resonances of even the most incidental revision. And this is only appropriate. For the work of poety, Mal- larme suggests, is as often akin to the spinning of the silk worm as it is to the bellowing of a titan, and the poet's raw material may just as well come from the pages of a dictionary as from the book of nature.

NOTES I would like to thank Ellen Burt for her invaluable help and support at every stage of this essay's writing and publication. All translations, unless otherwise noted or documented, are my own. In the case of passages translated from Mallarme's writ- ing, I have aimed less for felicity than for a literal rendering of the sentence, reproducing as closely as possible their often significant syntax. I have profitably consulted previous translations of Mallarme's poetry (by Cohn), prose poems (by Franklin), and theoretical texts (by Cook). I would like to thank Liz Constable, who made some useful last-minute suggestions on the translations. 1 For a (brief) comparative treatment of many of Mallarme's variants, and a discussion of his compositional practices, see Verdin. Verdin does not offer any significant theoretical discussion of the revisions or of the notion of variants. More recently, Laurence Porter has addressed the problem of poetic inspiration as manifested in Mallarme's late revisions. His remarks on "Quelle soie" (44) point to some of the phonetic qualities of the definitive version which I deal with here. Like Verdin, however, Porter applies the traditional assumptions of variant readings to Mallarme's poems: "As an author's revisions offer the surest clue to his or her intentions (even overt, discursive statements of purpose must be considered less definitive than the concrete evidence of variants), it is these we should examine" (28). On Mallarme's often extensive revisions of his prose texts, see Paxton. The only poem by Mallarme whose revisions have received substantial attention is "Le Pitre chatie." In his analysis of this poem, Leo Bersani suggests that Mallarme's revisions can be understood "as a model of criticism," in which the revision depicts the experience of re-reading the variant text (22). For another reading of Mallarme's revisions of "Le Pitre chatie," see Austin ("Mallarme's Reshaping"). 2 This claim is the basis of most traditional textual criticism. As Dearing argues, for example, "The goal of textual analysis is not . .. merely to provide a geneal- ogy of the states of a text, but more importantly to identify the state from which the others have descended or, if such a state is not known to be extant, then to reconstruct the latest state from which all the extant states have descended. This identified or reconstructed state is in most respects the closest we can approach to the author's original intention" (2). This original intention inheres in what textual critics call the "work" (Dearing's "identified or reconstructed state"). Whereas the "text" is a physical document and consists of a specific arrangement of words on a page (e.g. a manuscript or an edition), the "work," although discerned from available texts, is not presumed to be fully instantiated in any particular concrete form. The idea of the "work" is, in this respect, 731</page><page sequence="22">MATTHEW POTOLSKY something of a quasi-metaphysical construct, which says as much about the theoretical underpinnings of modern textual criticism as it does about the writing of literary works. My discussion of textual criticism here, however, should not be taken to suggest that the practitioners of this field are or ever have been of one mind on the question of authorial intention. Particularly among editors of classical or medieval texts, where autograph manuscripts are absent or nearly impossible to authenticate, authorial intention is often recog- nized merely as a convenient construct. Similarly, as Jerome McGann argues in his critique of the traditional methods of textual scholarship, even in modern literatures, an authorized final text may be the product of conflicting social forces that cannot be reduced to the unified intention of a single author. In- deed, as McGann suggests, the very concept of authorial intention relies on Romantic notions of an autonomous subject. It is, perhaps, no coincidence that Mallarme's potential challenge to textual criticism arises from a poetics that questions precisely these Romantic notions of the self. McGann's book may be seen as the starting point for an important and ongoing reconsideration of textual criticism, especially its reliance on authorial intention, in the light of recent theoretical advances. Many of the most useful articles in the debate over the nature and future of textual criticism may be found in the two recent collections of essays on this subject edited by Cohen, and by Bornstein and Williams. 3 This is the basic principle behind the recent development of critique genetique in France, which argues for a return to the earliest available state of a text. For a brief discussion of the origins and conceptual basis of critique genetique, see Hay. 4 This possibility is the crux of an important debate between Maurice Blanchot and Charles Mauron. Blanchot objects to Mauron's insistence on the necessity (and possibility) of paraphrasing Mallarme's poems, on rendering a "transla- tion in prose" (Mallarme l'obscur 24) as a means of dealing with their obscurity. "The primary character of poetic meaning," Blanchot writes in response, "is that it is tied, without possible alteration, to the language that manifests it.... The sense of the poem is inseparable from all of the words, from all of the movements, from all of the accents of the poem. The poem does not exist except within this entirety and it would disappear as soon as one sought to separate it from the form it has been given. What the poem means coincides exactly with what it is" (127-8). For Blanchot, the argument of a Mallarme poem (and presumably of any poem) cannot be removed from its context within the specific form that instantiates it. Any paraphrase will crucially alter the poem qua poem and thus do violence to its meaning. 5 The nature and significance of this crisis, during which Mallarme was obsessed with the notions of Nothingness and death, has been of persistent interest to critics. Occupying a period from the spring of 1866 to the early 1870s, and documented in a series of well-known letters, this crisis produced some of Mallarme's most difficult and important works (including "Herodiade" and "Igitur"), and set the basic terms for his later criticism. For the biographical background of the "crise," see Millan (123-83). Mossop (Pure 108-66) offers a scrupulous discussion of the stages and major themes of the crisis. Probably the best brief theoretical discussions of the crisis and its consequences for Mal- larme's poetry are those of Poulet (298-355) and Bersani (1-24). 6 On this score, one might compare the notion of a coherent and transportable theme to the textual critic's model of the "work" as opposed to the "text" (see note 2). 7 See, on this matter, Leo Bersani's discussion of Mallarme's often proclaimed "death." According to Bersani, Mallarme's desire to capture the "effects" of 732</page><page sequence="23">MLN things rather than the things themselves has "erased the individual subject necessary... to register such effects" (6). It is this "non-psychological phenom- enology" of the natural world which at once defines Mallarmte's poetry and renders the traditional poetic subject null and void. The "death" of the poet in turn threatens any thematic system based on authorial subjectivity: "what [Mal- larme] refers to as his death, far from being another theme in his writing, is the move which ruins the possibility of thematic understanding" (19). 8 The question of Mallarme's "obscurity" has been of persistent interest to critics, who have long sought the mythical "key" (philosophical, psychological, occult) that would unlock the "secrets" of his symbolism. To my mind, however, the most "lucid" account of this matter is BarbaraJohnson's claim that "Mallarme's famous obscurity lies not in his devious befogging of the obvious but in his radical transformation of intelligibility itself through the ceaseless production of seemingly mutually exclusive readings of the same piece of language" ("Po- etry" 69). Obscurity, for Johnson, thus consists in an excess of meaning, an irreducible multiplicity of plausible readings, and not in the concealment of any particular message "behind" occluding symbolism. For a further elabora- tion of this performative model of obscurity, see Bowie's scrupulous account of Mallarme's "difficulty" as the product of an excess of syntactical possibilities over semantic strictures. Classic discussions of Mallarme's obscurity may be found in Thibaudet (60-72), Mauron, Blanchot, and Boulay. For a broader consideration of poetic obscurity see Steiner and Read, both of whom touch on Mallarme's poetry. Mallarme's own most extended response to charges of ob- scurity is in "Le Mystere dans les lettres" (CEuvres completes 382-87), where his ironic defense is that his "contemporains ne savent pas lire (contemporaries do not know how to read)" (386). 9 The irony of Mallarme's formulation is, of course, that in thus eliding the poet's intention the poem does precisely what the theorist would intend it to do. If, that is, Mallarme's poetic theory would efface the question of authorial intention, it is able to do so only by imposing the intention of the theorist. Where the poet qua poet disappears from the text, the poet qua theorist is made all the more forcefully present. While this seeming contradiction in Mallarme's theoretical vision might lead one to question the coherence of his claims, it might also lead one to question the definitive status accorded to that vision. For the "difficulty" of Mallarme's theoretical writings to a great extent equals or even exceeds that of his poetry, suggesting that the line drawn between theory and practice is itself put into question by all of Mallarme's texts. In other words, if theory must be read as a kind of poetry, then it becomes all but impossible to distinguish the theoretical from the poetic utterance, the "pure" doctrine from its practical application. 10 The 1863 versions of this poem are interesting primarily in terms of this basic comparison, and share little else with the others; while the later two-the first sent, possibly along with an early version of the poem "Ses purs ongles," in a letter to Bonaparte Wyse on 2 July 1868, and the second only discovered post- humously, but written in the same period-are much closer to the "definitive" version in structure, vocabulary, and imagery. I shall therefore, in the interest of relative brevity, restrict my analysis to these later versions of the work. Hence- forth I will describe these as the third, fourth, and definitive versions of the poem. Complete texts of all the variants may be found in the Appendix. For a detailed commentary on and reliable texts of these poems, see Barbier and Millan's excellent edition of the Poesies. The variants discussed in the present essay were first published by Souffrin ("De l'Orient") in 1946, and Mondor ("Alternative") in 1954. To my knowledge, only two previous critics have treated 733</page><page sequence="24">MATTHEW POTOLSKY the relationship among these variants in some depth: Lawler ("'Expirer' "), and Benichou (151-63), both of whom are primarily interested in measuring what the states of the poems might say about Mallarme's artistic development. For a reading of "L'Assaut," see Gill. 11 Similar conceits describing a woman's hair may be found, among other places, in the poems "Tristesse d'ete," "La Chevelure vol d'une flamme," and "Victo- rieusement fui le suicide beau," and in the section of "Igitur" entitled "Le Minuit." Wais (595-99) and Davies both note some further echoes of such imag- ery in Mallarme's writings. On images of hair and fabric in Mallarme's poetry, see, among many other discussions, the extensive, if largely conventional, elab- orations by Soula, Richard (82-4), and Fowlie (37-48). 12 Most of the readings of this poem are in (remarkable) agreement on the gen- eral situation represented, and on the significance of the primary images and figures. See Benichou, Chisholm, Cohn, Condat, Davies, Fowlie, Hambly, Lawler ("'Expirer'"), Mauron, Mossop, Richard (83), and Soula for a representative sample of opinion on the sonnet. Austin ("Les moyens") scrupulously surveys and evaluates the major readings of the sonnet from the 1920s to the 1960s. 13 According to several commentators, among them Cohn and Wais, this mistress is specifically intended to be Mallarme's own mistress, Mery Laurent, whereas in the earlier version the woman's hair belonged to Mallarme's wife or sister. 14 As Fowlie (38) and Benichou (160) suggest, the silk may in fact represent an initial description of the flags. Condat is perhaps the only critic who has ques- tioned the generally accepted reading of the flags and the military celebration. He suggests that the sentence "Les trous de drapeaux meditants / S'exaltent dans notre avenue:" should be read as a passive, rather than as the reflexive construction it is normally supposed to be. The flags would thus be the passive agent of the verb "s'exaltent," and "trous" a metaphor for windows. Given this reading the sentence might be rendered thus: "the thoughtful flags make the windows lively in our avenue." While this reading is awkward and perhaps un- likely, it does offer a possible alternative to the traditional account, which must posit a context for its reading (namely, a military celebration) that is not evident in the poem. In the first two versions of the poem, though, the word soie refers specifically to a flag: "Ta pale chevelure ondoie / Parmi les parfums de ta peau / Comme folatre un blanc drapeau / Dont la soie au soleil blondoie. (Your pale hair billows / Among the perfumes of your skin / Like a lively white flag / Whose silk has lightened in the sun.)" (iEuvres completes 23). 15 Robert Greer Cohn has been instrumental in bringing this aspect of Mallarme's writing to the attention of scholars, especially in his discussions of Mallarme's philological textbook Les Mots anglais, which assigns a precise significance to the shapes and sounds of English words and letters. For further elaboration, see Appendix C (265-80) in Toward the Poems of Mallarme. 16 Laurence Porter also notes this phonological play, suggesting that it "adds a note of modal uncertainty, in and of itself and also by hinting at the phrase 'quelle que soit' (whatever may be)" (44). 17 Mallarme's refusal clearly to privilege the referential over the non-referential dimensions of language (or vice-versa) raises a vexing interpretive dilemma. Theoretically, any limits placed on the non-referential "play" of language would have to be wholly arbitrary. The phonological chain suggested by the homon- ymy of soie and soit should be infinite, extending not only beyond the poet's intentions, but even beyond the limits of the French language or the poet's historical frame of reference. For if, as Mallarme suggests, words alone should govern their "reciprocal reflections," then the poet's native language or histori- 734</page><page sequence="25">M L N cal context will have no absolute claim over the development of linguistic asso- ciations. At the same time, this possibility should not be taken as proof that Mallarme simply disdains the referential functions of language. As Paul de Man argues, in "Lyric and Modernity," Mallarme never gives up a belief in the ability of language to refer to an objective reality, and even the most hermetic of his symbolic systems begin and end with a natural image. In this respect, the ambi- guity of reference is the constitutive problematic of Mallarme's poetry. But it is a problematic that he seems satisfied repeatedly to enact, rather than to resolve. 18 Many other examples of this kind of verbal obsession have been noted in Mal- larme's poetry. In addition to "Mes bouquins," Thibaudet also points to the word "Palmes" as the core word of "Don du Poeme." Michael Riffaterre, in a significant reading of this poem, has suggested that its basis is not the single word "Palme," but the cliche "palmes d'Idumee," which also accounts for other images in the poem (151-63). Karlheinz Stierle adduces a purely verbal origin for the poem "Prose pour des Esseintes," which he suggests arises out of the poet's experience of the word "Anastase." The mass of critical attempts to explain the mysterious word "ptyx," in the poem "Ses purs ongles," might be taken as an almost transferrential manifestation of a Mallarmean verbal obses- sion among his readers. The word from Mallarme's poem, in this respect, would impose itself on his critics. For further elaboration on Mallarme's cult of the word, see Richard (528-36). 19 Such a process of "Transposition," Davies suggests, also governs the revision of the poem itself. The definitive version, he claims, seeks to supplant with its own synthesis the basic oppositions developed in the two earlier variants: "While conserving the opposition between the silk and the woman's hair, the poet strives to go beyond the antagonism between Being and Nothing and to achieve a synthesis corresponding more to the principles of his doctrine of Transposi- tion" (Mallarme 170). As, therefore, the tercets describe the reduction of mate- rials to essences, so the process of revision "purifies" the raw material of the variants into a definitive text. For a further elaboration of the notion of Trans- position, see Davies' essay "Mallarme's Commitment." 20 On Mallarme's potential relation to Hegelian thought, a relation assumed by Davies' reading and much discussed by scholars, see the recent studies by Lan- gan and Reynolds. See, also, Kristeva's brief but illuminating comments on the subject (534-40), as well as Derrida's remarks scattered throughout "The Dou- ble Session" (e.g. 194, 207, 219, 270). For both Kristeva and Derrida, Mallarme's Hegelianism is largely ironic, what Derrida describes as "a simulacrum" of Hegelianism, which makes use of Hegelian notions and terminology but does so in a way antithetical to systematic philosophy. The same thing might be said of Mallarme's ostensible and much-studied Platonism. 21 On this reading of the tercets, see Lawler, who suggestively notes that the poem describes "the act of composition as a kind of murder by which a cry is stifled" (Language 10). Laurence Porter also discusses the almost threatening image of creation and inspiration in Mallarme's late poetry. For Porter, Mallarme's con- stant evocations of the difficulty of writing do not specifically reflect a tortured psychological state, but enact a critique of conventional notions of poetic inspi- ration: "Mallarme calls into question not inspiration per se but the irrepressible, instinctive tendency to hypostatize inspiration, to conceive it as coming from a supernatural Beyond rather than from within ourselves" (36). This critique, according to Porter, takes the form in Mallarme's late works of a Muse always vanishing or unattainable. 22 On the image and significance of death in Mallarme's poetry and theoretical writings, see Assad, Bersani, and Favre. 735</page><page sequence="26">MATTHEW POTOLSKY 23 There are, in fact, further resonances with the process of silk production among many of the words new to the definitive version. Looking further in Littre, one discovers, for example, that the word touffe, referring in the poem to the mis- tresses hair, also turns out to be a "Maladie de vers 5a soie (sickness of silk worms)." And the word torse, also a description of the hair, has similar connec- tions to silk production, at least in terms of Littre's examples. Thus in one place he illustrates the noun form of the word as an "Operation that consists in twisting the silk passed through a bath of dye." WORKS CITED Assad, Maria L.
