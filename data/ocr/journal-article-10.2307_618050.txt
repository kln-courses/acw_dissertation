<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS superficially, that the most significant editions have been produced outside Iran. In the early 1970s it did not look as if this state of affairs would continue but, to use the kind of image dear to the poet, Time has again shown it cannot be trusted, and the first volume of what may well become the standard critical edition reaches us, having been competently type-set in London, from the United States. Six volumes of text and two of notes are planned. Vol. 1 goes up to the reign of Kaiqubad, but it is the editor's work rather than Firdausi's well-known story that needs to be reviewed. Dr. Khaliqi-Mutlaq has devoted many years to the Shdhndma and published important articles on problems of the text and on the manuscript tradition and now takes the logical step of making his results accessible to the judgement of readers in the form of a critical text based on early manu- scripts, and with systematic recording of variant readings. In its essentials the method is not applied to the Shdhndma for the first time: it is that of the Moscow edition begun under the direction of Bertels and of sections of the work edited later in Tehran, notably by the Bunyad-i Shahnama under the late Mojtaba Minovi. It is the number of manuscripts deployed and the exact knowledge and rigorous application of the canons of textual criticism that mark the new edition. The most notable single addition to the tex- tual basis is the Florence MS (F) dated 614/ 1217, initially discovered and described by A. M. Piemontese. It only contains the first half of the poem, but for that it replaces the British Library copy of 1276 (L) as our earliest witness (apart of course from the Arabic translation of Bundari, which has inevitable limitations). As opposed to the Moscow edition's 4, later 5, MSS, the new one systematically records variants from 12, and on occasion those of 3 others. All date from before 1500. The editor states that the MSS can be classified into several general groups (elsewhere he has assigned them to two major families but argued that the tradi- tion does not support Bertels' thesis of two recensions by the author); but it appears that no direct relationship exists between any of these MSS. The construction of a stemma and, a fortiori, the classic operation of reconstructing an archetype are impossible. Dr. Khaliqi- Mutlaq takes F for his base but, having criti- cized others for excessive reliance on L, is well aware that seniores are not necessarily priores. He regards F as the best MS on other grounds than that of age, for instance, its retention of older spellings and vocabulary, but does not follow it blindly and in his introduction sets forth his criteria for overriding its evidence when necessary: consensus of other MSS, agree- ment of some other MSS plus Bundari etc. He regards the most important of these as the selection of the lectio difficilior. The principle is of course an accepted one but can leave room for debate over the definition of the more diffi- cult, and here there is a tendency to assume that ' older' spellings must have been systematically used in the original. The principle of uniformity of spelling is also invoked in the editor's remarks on conjectural emendation. Judgement must vary between individual cases, and be influenced by the amount of manuscript (and other) support in each case. We can, for instance, welcome Gayumart, Tahmurat and Aghrirat and Farigis for Farangis, even if the last does not seem likely to win popularity as a girl's name. The alternatives can hardly be variants and a choice has to be made. However, to judge by the earliest surviving Persian MSS it is unlikely that the original of the Shahndma was uniformly consistent in its spellings of many words for which alternative forms are found in our MSS of it, as well as in other early texts, even if it is often possible to declare that one form is in a sense older than the other. However, the editor's approach is generally cautious and his prodigious knowledge of both the text of the Shahnama and of early Persian literature no doubt lend support to his choices in such cases. The Shdhndma is very long and there is a large quantity of early emendation and inter- polation in the best MSS we possess, caused to some extent no doubt by its use for recitation. Little wonder that solid critical work for long progressed slowly. May this new edition be completed as soon as possible, for not only is it a great advance in itself but by establishing a better text and by so clearly defining the pos- sibilities it will enable those less qualified than Dr. KhaliqT-Mutlaq to get a truer feel for the poet's style and facilitate further progress. We cannot realistically expect to see a text as the poet wrote it, but it is nevertheless possible to get nearer to that unattainable goal. A great step is now being taken towards it. The reviewer has noted a few obvious mis- prints in the text: p. 13, 1. 131. Read shdd for bud, which arises by dittography from 130; p. 17, 1. 183. kashm7r for kamshTr; p. 25, 1.70. jahan for jan; p. 67, 1. 198. khurishTdan for khurshTdan; p. 124, 1. 545. fughdnT for mughdnT; p. 141, 1. 856. yaksar for yaksarah; p. 171, 1. 133 bar ddramit for barddaramit; p. 182, 1.270. zdwul for zawdl; p. 199, 1. 522. ghabghabash for ghabghash; p. 267, 1. 1472. kard mast for mast kard. A. H. MORTON JAGAT PATI JOSHI and ASKO PARPOLA: Corpus of Indus seals and inscrip- tions. 1. Collections in India. (Annales Academiae Scientarum Fennicae, Sarja-Ser. B, Nide-Tom. 239 = Memoirs of the Archaeologi- cal Survey of India, No. 86.) xxxii, 392 pp. Helsinki: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 1987. This impressive volume is the product of close co-operation between the Finnish Academy of Sciences and the Archaeological Survey of India, reinforced by the financial support of UNESCO. The numbered pages 1-364 (black and white) and 377-392 (colour) contain high- quality photographic illustrations of Indus seals, 'tablets', and graffiti, mostly inscribed. Such reproduction in legible form of the evidence for the Indus script is of course an essential preliminary to systematic attempts at its decipherment. This could provide the solu- tion of what in recent decades has proved one of the most stubborn problems of Orientalist scholarship. It goes without saying that decipherment of the Indus script and language 567</page><page sequence="2">would illuminate a whole new epoch of the past, completing the expanding picture offered by archaeology of the South Asian world in the third millennium B.C. Further volumes, initially two, are planned to cover the Indus seals preserved in Pakistan, and those elsewhere in the world. The third volume is also to contain the detailed catalogue of the pieces illustrated in the others, including that under review. The reader's first reaction is of admiration at what can be achieved when excellent scholar- ship is supported by first-class technical assistance and facilities. The assembling of so many admirable photographs, including many new ones, from objects in various museums, was a monumental undertaking. Throughout the work, photographs both of the original seals and of their impressions are included, frequently more than one of each, so that all possibilities of lighting are exploited. These plates form a fundamental resource for those interested in problems of the Indus writing. They are equally an unrivalled repertoire for students of art-history and religion. This iconography, preoccupied especially with bovines, suggests links with that of historic India. To the celebrated ' buffalo-hored deity' (M-304), moreover, besides the standard photos (p. 75), a colour illustration is devoted (p. 382-3). The authors understandably incline (despite some dissenting voices, e.g. Doris Srinivasan, 'Unhinging Siva from the Indus civilization', JRAS, 1984, 1, 77-89), to the traditional 'Siva' identification (p. xvii). No less interesting are the three seals (M-306- p. 76 and again in colour p. 384-M-307 and M-308) depicting an 'anthropomorph' grap- pling two lions-a reflection of the 'Master of the Beasts'. This was a subject widespread in ancient Near Eastern art and often labelled 'Gilgamesh', but more probably meant to represent a deity than a 'hero triumphant'. Which deity was intended could vary according to the context, and there is no indication at present which is depicted here. A concise introduction occupies the 32 pre- liminary pages, sketching the background to the discovery of Harappan civilization. There is a valuable survey and bibliography of current research, of the significance of Indus seals for the history of cultural contacts, and of the prevailing enigma of the script. Despite gallant efforts, one is left, inevitably, with the pessi- mistic impression that there has been little effec- tive progress in decipherment since G. R. Hun- ter's Script of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro in 1934. The present book will certainly provide a stimulus for further research. Classification of the entries is arranged according to ownership, all the items here being in Indian public collec- tions. Then the succeeding levels of organiza- tion are by site-provenance, category of object, form, material, and iconography. Subjects are classified as 'unicorns', urus (= aurochs), bison, zebu, buffalo, markhor, goat, deer, rhinoceros, elephant, tiger, hare, snake, gharial, animal group, joined and composite animals, anthropomorph, tree, cult object ('manger'), ship, swastika, geometric designs, and aniconic. This arrangement allows rapid identification of specimens, and is eminently practical. Analysis of the inscriptions in relation to provenance, iconography and assumed function of the seals now becomes possible, and-will no doubt be pursued by researchers in due course. Interestingly, for example, on p. 191, H-102, the sign-group on the reverse of the seal (in intaglio, therefore a counterseal), also forms the first group of the inscription on the obverse. The same is the case with p. 79, M-318. There the element following is ' numerical', succeeded, as frequently, by a 'trident'. Similar 'numeral' groupings terminated by the 'trident' are on M-17, M-32, M-103, M-177 to 179, M-224, M-254, M-283, M-292, L-20, K-19. The trident ending has a special, perhaps exclusive, affinity for numeral groups. These are no doubt but a few of the intriguing sequences perceptible on these handsome plates, so much more easily grasped by human imagination than the blind numerals of previous computer printout. No doubt numerous leads will be suggested to future researchers. In a work on this scale, comprising 1537 items, occasional errors naturally are inevitable, though they seem com- mendably few. There is a list of corrigenda on p. 375, to which one may add the trifle that on p. 242, L-16A and L-16a (the original and its impression) appear transposed. In advance of the formal catalogue, there is a list (pp. 366- 375) of concordance, excavation and museum numbers. (The first series are those of S. Koskenniemi, A. and S. Parpola, Materials for the study of Indus script, I: a concordance to the Indus inscriptions, Helsinki 1973.) Ultimately reverse concordances of numbers will also be helpful, now easily compiled by computer spreadsheet. This book constitutes a major achievement, providing a fresh start for a study that not long ago seemed in danger of stagnating. The purposes of its distinguished sponsors have been admirably fulfilled, and readers will look forward with enthusiasm to the appearance of the succeeding volumes. A. D. H.

The work under review is another splendidly produced volume of Persian literature from the publishers of Nima Yushij's When the elephants came and Sadiq Hadayat's Patient stone in translation. It is a timely production since the fourteenth-century Persian poet and thinker, Khvaja Shams al-Din Muhammad Hafiz, of Shiraz, has only recently been reinstated in the Islamic Republic of Iran as one of the country's greatest poetical luminaries. This convenient publication should undoubtedly attract a new body of readers who may hitherto have only occasionally heard of the sage of Shiraz and who may not be well equipped linguistically to appreciate the intricacies of his poetical langu- age and the underlying philosophical ideas so dear to the Persians. HaIfiz's poetry has long stimulated great inter- est among Persian scholars in the Western world. There have been many attempts to popularize his ghazals and to attract a broader readership, but these translations have not 568 REVIEWS</page></plain_text>
