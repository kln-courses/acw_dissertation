Fox University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19174 INTRODUCTION During the past decade, from the mid- 1960s to the present, there has been a progressive outpouring of publications on the social, ethical, theological, and legal implications of developments in biomedical research and technology. The appear- ance of this now vast literature has coincided with the emergence of a new area of inquiry and action that has come to be known as bioethics.' In the words of Daniel Callahan (1973e), a philosopher-ethicist who has pioneered in this field, "Bioethics is not yet a full discipline. Most of its practitioners have wandered into the field from somewhere else, more or less inventing it as they go. . . . It is not yet a genuine discipline as that concept is usually understood in the academic and scientific communities." From its inception, bioethics has been multidimensional and cross-disciplinary in orientation and content. Formal statements about the primary participants in the discussion, research, and writing that it has entailed are likely to cite sociologists along with "physicians, biologists, psychologists, . . . lawyers, historians and philo- sophical and religious ethicists" (Walters 1975). However, an examination of the literature on bioethical issues associated with advances in medical science, technol- ogy, and therapy reveals a remarkable paucity of work by sociologists or by other social scientists in this area. The relative absence of sociological articles and books concerned with these aspects of biomedical knowledge and techniques is surprising; 'It is unclear who coined the term bioethics. Van Rensselaer Potter, a biologist who has conducted cancer research throughout his career, claims to have invented this new word and the field that goes with it (Potter 1970, 1971). Potter views bioethics as a "science of survival . . . built on the science of biology and enlarged beyond the traditional boundaries to include the most essential elements of the social sciences and the humanities with emphasis on philosophy in the strict sense, meaning 'love of wisdom' " (Potter 1971:1-2). 231</page><page sequence="2">232 FOX many of the questions of value and belief with which the bioethics literature is concerned are appropriate foci for social research as well as for philosophical, theological, medical, and legal inquiry. Furthermore, the growth of intellectual, professional, and public interest in ethical and existential issues that this literature reflects is an important sociocultural happening that merits sociological study. This review identifies some of the ways in which the new bioethical concern has been manifesting itself on the American scene during the past ten years. It then proceeds to examine certain attributes of the literature associated with this concern. Attention is focused on the sparse contribution sociologists have made to the litera- ture. In this connection, some observations on the phenomena, concepts, and issues with which sociologists of medicine have more characteristically dealt are presented. Finally, the relatively few books and articles on socioethical implications of biomedical research, therapeutic innovation, or technology written by sociologists are discussed, both from the point of view of the questions that they treat and the social circle that their authors constitute. Manifestations of Bioethical Concern The bioethical concern that has surfaced in recent years has crystallized around particular biomedical advances and cultural themes (Fox 1974b): ... Actual and anticipated developments in genetic engineering and counseling, life support systems, birth technology, population control, the implantation of human, ani- mal, and artificial organs, as well as in the modification and control of human thought and behavior are principal foci of concern. Within this framework, special attention is concentrated on the implications of amniocentesis (a procedure for detecting certain genetic disorders in utero), in vitro fertilization, the prospect of cloning (the asexual reproduction of an unlimited number of genetically identical individuals from a single parent), organ transplantation, the use of the artificial kidney machine, the development of an artificial heart, the modalities of the intensive care unit, the practice of psychosurg- ery, and the introduction of psychotropic drugs. Cross-cutting the consideration being given to these general and concrete areas of biomedical development, there is marked preoccupation with the ethicality of human experimentation under various conditions, with the proper definition of death and the human treatment of the dying, and with the presumed right of every individual and group to health and adequate health care. Certain moral and metaphysical themes recur in the discussions of all these aspects of the . .. new biology and medicine. Problems of uncertainty, meaning, of the quality of life and death, of scarcity, equity, and distributive justice, of freedom and coercion, dignity and degrada- tion, solidarity and societal community, and of the vigor with which one ought to intervene in the human condition are repeatedly mentioned. Since the mid-1960s, a number of new centers and programs have been estab- lished, whose primary reason for existence is to deal with these matters. Among the most preeminent are the Institute of Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences in Has- tings-on-the-Hudson, New York; the Joseph and Rose Kennedy Institute for the Study of Human Reproduction and Bioethics, located at Georgetown University in Washington DC; the Society for Health and Human Values in Philadelphia; the Foundation of Thanatology in New York City; the Department of Humanities</page><page sequence="3">ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY 233 program at the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine in Hershey; the Institute for the Medical Humanities at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston; the Harvard University Program on Technology and Society;2 and the Harvard Interfaculty Program in Medical Ethics. In addition, organizations such as the Euthanasia Society of America and the Euthanasia Education Fund, both in New York City, which were founded in an earlier era, have acquired greater visibil- ity during the bioethics decade. These organizations and programs and others like them have received sponsorship or support from an impressive array of private foundations, scholarly bodies and government agencies, such as the Ford, Robert Wood Johnson, Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., Andrew W. Mellon, Rockefeller, and Rus- sell Sage foundations; the National Academy of Sciences, the National Institute of Medicine; the American Academy of Sciences; the New York Academy of Sciences; the National Endowment for the Humanities; and the National Institutes of Health (Branson 1975, Fox 1974b). During the same period, a number of new guidelines and codes relevant to bioethical issues have been developed. These include the "definition of irreversible coma as the new criterion of death," proposed by the Harvard Medical School's Ad Hoc Committee to Examine the Definition of Brain Death (1968), the "Patient's Bill of Rights" presented by the American Hospital Association (1972), and the institu- tional guidelines for human research adopted by the Food and Drug Administra- tion, on the one hand, and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare-National Institutes of Health-Public Health Service complex, on the other (US Dept. Health, Educ., Welfare, Publ. Health Serv. and Natl. Inst. Health 1971, US Dept. Health, Educ., Welfare, Natl. Inst. Health 1974, US Dept. Health, Educ., Welfare 1974, Curran 1970, Frankel 1972). In addition, a series of legislative and judicial actions with bioethical import have been occurring. A number of public hearings on "ethical, social and legal implica- tions of advances in biomedical research and technology"3 have been held by the US Congress, among which the 1972 investigation into the Tuskegee syphilis study, which was partly funded by federal agencies, evoked the greatest amount of political, public, and symbolic attention (US Cong., Senate Comm. on Labor, Publ. Welfare 1973; US Dept. Health, Educ., Welfare, Publ. Health Serv. 1973). On July 12, 1974, Public Law 93-348, Title II, brought into being a temporary two-year National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. This is an eleven-person group of professionals drawn from medicine, psychophysiology, the law, theology, and philosophy, whose task is to study a 2The Harvard Program on Technology and Society, founded in 1964, terminated in 1972. As its name implies, it was not only concerned with the consequences and implications of biomedical developments, but of scientific advance and technology more generally. 3From a speech delivered in 1971 by US Senator Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota on the floor of the Senate, as he introduced a bill to establish a National Commission on Health, Science and Society. Along with Senator Mondale, other members of the United States Congress who have been consistently involved in bioethical issues include Senators James Buckley, Edward Kennedy, and Jacob Javits; and Congressmen Emilio Daddario and Paul Rogers.</page><page sequence="4">234 FOX designated set of bioethical issues. These include fetal research; the problem of obtaining informed voluntary consent for investigations in which children, prison- ers, or persons who are mentally ill or retarded are asked to participate as subjects; and the ethics of psychosurgery. In the fall of 1975, a bill to establish the commission as a permanent body, and to extend its membership and jurisdiction was introduced into the Senate. A Uniform Anatomical Gift Act has been adopted in 51 jurisdic- tions, which permits persons to donate all or parts of their bodies to be used for medical purposes after their death (Sadler, Sadler &amp; Stason 1968; Sadler &amp; Sadler 1973). Beginning with the Kansas Death Statute of 1970, eight states have passed legislation that places the new, "irreversible coma" criterion of brain death on an equal legal footing with the traditional pronouncement of death on the basis of cessation of respiratory and cardiac function (Curran 1971, Kennedy 1971, Capron &amp; Kass 1972, Capron 1973). Through its 1973 ruling on the case of Roe v. Wade, the United States Supreme Court granted the pregnant woman and the attending physician greater rights to determine whether or not an abortion will be performed. Also, in its decision on Doe v. Bolton, handed down in the same year, the Court stated that private hospitals may be barred from adopting restrictions on abortion eligibility that are more severe than those imposed by state law. During the past decade the Supreme Court has also arrived at several decisions that have advanced the "right to treatment" concept. In Rouse v. Cameron (1966), the Court ruled that an involuntarily committed patient has such a right to treatment, that the court has the responsibility to determine whether or not he (she) is receiving it, and if not, why. In the case of Wyatt v. Stickney (1971), the Court decided that programs of treatment in state mental hospitals were scientifically and medically inadequate and thus deprived patients of their constitutional rights. Defendants were given six months to implement satisfactory treatment programs. Most recently, in the case of Donaldson v. O'Connor (1974), the Court ruled against the involuntary, purely custodial confinement of untreated, mentally ill persons who are not dangerous to themselves or others, and who can live in the community with the help of family or friends. The plaintiff in this case was not only judged to have been deprived df a constitutional right to receive treatment, but he was released from the hospital and awarded damages for the 14 ?12 years in which he had been institutionalized with little or no psychiatric care or therapy. Finally, in 1975-1976 the New Jersey courts were asked for a decision in the unprecedented case of Karen Ann Quinlan, whose parents petitioned for authorization to turn off a respirator that had helped to keep her alive in a "persistent vegetative state" for almost a year. The Superior Court denied this request on the ground that it would take life from a "person who is not brain dead by present known medical criteria," and who has the constitutional "right to live," but not the "right to die" (Superior Court of New Jersey 1975). The case was appealed to the State Supreme Court, which rendered a "declaratory re- lief" judgment, grounded in the "right of privacy." Mr. Quinlan was named his daughter's guardian and empowered to discontinue the life-support apparatus, if attending physicians and the hospital ethics committee agreed that there was "no reasonable possibility" that she would return to a "cognitive, sapient state" (Su- preme Court of New Jersey 1976).</page><page sequence="5">ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY 235 Many of these developments have been accompanied by wide media coverage, generating a huge body of newspaper and magazine articles on the biomedical advances, ethical and existential issues, cultural themes, new institutions and guide- lines, and legislative and judicial actions involved. In addition, an impressive num- ber of scholarly articles and books on these matters have been published during the same ten-year period. This literature is too extensive to review systematically or to summarize,4 but various bibliographies have been published that provide useful maps to it. For example, there is the Hastings Center Bibliography of Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences (Sollitto &amp; Veatch 1973; Sollitto, Veatch &amp; Fenner 1975); the Kennedy Institute Bibliography of Bioethics (Walters 1975); and the report and annotated bibliography on Ethical Issues in Health Services, published by the De- partment of Health, Education, and Welfare (Carmody 1974). There is an array of National Library of Medicine bibliographies on particular bioethical subjects, as- sembled by its Literature Search Program (human experimentation, informed con- sent, death, psychosurgery, genetic counseling, genetic engineering, transplantation, and hemodialysis, among others).5 There are bibliographies on special bioethical topics such as abortion, genetics, hemodialysis, organ transplantation, and death and dying, compiled by authors working intensively in these areas, among which the death and dying bibliographies are the most conspicuous (Clouser &amp; Zucker 1974, Sorenson 1973, Fox &amp; Swazey 1974a, Kubler-Ross 1969, Kutscher 1969, Kalish 1970, Smith &amp; Penry 1972, McCormick 1973, Crane 1975a). Intellectual and Social Attributes of the Bioethical Literature Philosophical and theological ethicists, physicians (particularly psychiatrists), biolo- gists, and lawyers are the most prolific and prominent contributors to the literature. The ethicist authors predominate, in number and in their intellectual and public policy influence. Some of the major authors in each of these clusters are: 1.

Robitscher is a psychiatrist-lawyer, with a doctorate in jurisprudence, as well as a doctorate in medicine). 4This review article represents a responsibly comprehensive, but by no means exhaustive survey of the literature. 5These are available from the Literature Search Program, National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland 20014.</page><page sequence="6">236 FOX 3. In the lawyer group: Alexander Morgan Capron, William J. Curran, and Charles Fried.6 A majority of the authors who have made important contributions to the bioethics literature are active members either of the Hastings Institute of Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences, or of the Center for Bioethics of the Kennedy Institute. Some of them are members of both. Many of these authors received their professional educa- tion in the same schools-Yale, Johns Hopkins, Harvard, and Columbia-and those who are academics are clustered in certain universities, for example, Boston Univer- sity, Cornell, Georgetown, Princeton, and the University of Pennsylvania, as well as the ones already cited. Intellectuals of Catholic and Protestant background are more numerous and salient in the bioethics literature than intellectuals of Jewish origin. This is especially noticeable in the philosophical and theological ethicist subgroup, and the least true of the biomedical subgroup. A significant number of ethicist authors belong to the tradition of Christian ethics. Their training and orientation are more philosophical than theological. Even the theologians in this group of authors tend to develop their analyses in a philosophical rather than a theological framework. 61n the philosopher-theologian group: Sissela Bok (1970, 1973, 1974a, 1974b, 1975; Bok &amp; Behnke 1975); Daniel Callahan (1969a,b, 1970a,b, 1971a,b, 1972, 1973a,b,c,d,e,fg, 1974a,b, 1975; Callahan &amp; Gaylin 1974); K.

Several rabbis have suggested that this may be associated with the legalistic defini- tion of good and bad in orthodox Jewish tradition, which has also influenced modern, liberal Judaism. There is a vast body of laws (Mitzvot) for behavior in Jewish tradition, all of which are believed to have been commanded by God. In this framework one does something not because it is right or wrong, but because God commands it. Following the commandment is "the good," and not following it invites divine punishment.7 Although philosophers in the tradition of religious, particularly Christian, ethics have thus far had the greatest influence on the development of bioethics, this may be changing. During the past few years, the more general field of philosophical ethics has begun to pay a significant amount of attention to medical ethics. A Committee on Philosophy and Medicine has been formed within the American Philosophical Association. Its chairman is John Ladd of Brown University. The other members of the committee are H. Tristram Engelhardt Jr. (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston), Holly Goldman (University of Michigan), Samuel Gorovitz (University of Maryland), David Mayo (University of Minnesota), and William Ruddick (New York University). The increasing importance of medical ethics for philosophers is partly related to certain developments in American philosophical ethics since 1950. During the first half of the twentieth century, in the United States as in other English-speaking and -writing countries, metaethics, especially the analysis of ethical language, dominated the field. In the past 25 years, however, although work in metaethics has continued, an emphasis on normative ethics has been reintroduced into the discipline. Accord- ing to Carl Wellman (1972),8 race relations and civil rights were among the first specific moral issues on which professional philosophers focused their attention when this trend towards normative ethics began to manifest itself Philosophers next began to deal with questions of the just war, civil disobedience, and violence. Their recent work in medical ethics is a continuation and extension of this development. The philosopher, biomedical, and jurist authors cited have written about the whole gamut of bioethical concerns, but have devoted particular attention to several issues: human experimentation (especially questions of informed consent, notably problems of experimenting with fetuses); abortion (where again, the biological, legal, ethical, and human status of the fetus is one of the central questions pursued); genetic screening and counseling; and death and dying (problems of defining death, of making decisions about life-saving treatment, and of euthanasia, as well as of caring for dying patients). The bioethics literature on death and dying intersects 'Personal communication, Rabbi Martin P. Beifield Jr., Congregation Rodeph Shalom, Philadelphia, December 16, 1975. 8The analysis of "Ethics Since 1950" by Carl Wellman (Department of Philosophy, Wash- ington University, St. Louis, Missouri) contained in his article was supplemented by a personal communication, dated December 8, 1975, that I received from him.</page><page sequence="8">238 FOX with a much larger body of more popular writings on this subject that have been published in the last ten years. Exhortative, emotional, filled with personal testi- mony, often religious in tone, and sometimes cultic, these writings suggest that there is a phenomenon akin to a death and dying movement occurring in the United States, and that Elisabeth Kubler-Ross is one of its principal charismatic leaders9 (Fox 1974b). By and large, the bioethical literature is based on the assumption that the ethical and existential concern that has arisen in the biomedical sector of the society has been caused by biological and medical advances. Roy Branson (1975) states this widely held view in the following way: "In the late sixties, with the arrival of spectacular developments in medicine and biology such as heart and kidney trans- plants, and possibilities for genetic engineering, a wider public became interested in ethical issues raised by medicine and biology. A new era in the ethical reflection on medicine had begun." Partly because of their biomedical and technological deter- minism, few authors take note of the fact that some of the questions of value, belief, and meaning that have crystallized around biological and medical developments have also been central to a variety of nonmedical issues that have surfaced in American society over the past ten to fifteen years. (A number of the same cultural preoccupations and themes, for example, have appeared in the civil rights, peace, antipoverty, ecology, and women's movements). Nonetheless, the bioethics litera- ture is focused on American society and culture in ways that most authors seem to take for granted. They mention the extensive public as well as professional bioethical interest in the United States, without observing that these concerns are more mani- fest and pervasive here than in any other society. They do not ask why this is so, or whether the questions being pondered in and through bioethics have some distinc- tively American features. Thus, the literature does not deal with the possibility that the florescence of bioethics in the United States may be as much an expression of metamedical, collective conscience issues with which American society is grappling, as it is a consequence of spectacular developments in medicine and biology. Another general intellectual characteristic of the bioethical literature is the ten- dency of its contributing authors to call the religious as well as the philosophical issues associated with biomedical research and advance, ethical. Problems of mean- ing (such as "what is life?.," "what is death?.," "what is a life of quality or a death with dignity?," and "why do suffering, injustice, and inequity persist?"), that Max Weber and other social theorists consider to be the essence of religion are not distinguished from questions of normative ethics or moral philosophy. In part, this grows out of the predominance of philosophical ethics in the cognitive framework that has come to be shared by the interdisciplinary group of authors who have written about bioethical matters. It may also reflect their latent conviction that 91n her most recent talks and writings, Dr. Kubler-Ross has been presenting what she considers to be scientific evidence of a life after death, based on her interviews with many patients who "died" (showed no vital signs or brain waves), and then were "brought back to life" through heroic medical means (Kubler-Ross 1975).</page><page sequence="9">ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY 239 presenting these issues in the relatively secularized language of ethics facilitates communication between them because it transcends whatever their religious as well as disciplinary differences may be. These attributes of the bioethics literature-its social circles and social movement aspects, on the one hand, and some of its intellectual premises on the other-merit further investigation. Not only are they of interest from a sociology of knowledge point of view; they also have social policy implications. The authors, books and articles identified are influencing congressional hearings on various bioethical issues, the court's opinion in cases like that of Karen Ann Quinlan, the deliberations of bodies like the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, and the passage of legislation such as death statutes and the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act. Sociologists' Limited Contributions to Bioethics The limited contribution that sociologists have made to bioethics10 emanates largely from the prevailing intellectual orientation and the weltanschauung of present-day American sociology. Most sociologists have not chosen to concentrate on the kinds of problems with which bioethics is concerned and are unaware either that bioethics exists, or of its potential sociocultural import. This is related to sociologists' greater propensity to work in a social structural or social organizational frame of analysis than in a cultural one. In part, this preference is an artifact of the traditional conceptual emphasis of sociology, especially as it distinguishes itself from social or cultural anthropology. It is also connected with the ideological conviction held by many sociologists who espouse a critical, change-oriented, or radical approach to the field that focusing on questions of supposedly entrenched values and beliefs is inherently more conservative than being interested in what are assumed to be modifiable social structures. Along with these factors that have curtailed sociolo- gists' involvement in bioethical phenomena and issues, the lack of relevant interdis- ciplinary competence in the sociological community has been another deterrent. Some ability to handle the relationship between sociological variables, on the one 101 have not included the considerable sociological literature on population control issues and policies in what I have defined as the bioethical writings of sociologists. (The one exception I have made to this is the study of ethical aspects of population control that Donald Warwick is currently conducting under the aegis of the Institute of Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences). Sociologists like Bernard Berelson, Judith Blake, and Kingsley Davis who have written exten- sively on population matters are not cited or discussed in this review article. Some readers may consider my decision arbitrary, but I feel that it is justified on several grounds. It is true that this sociologically oriented population literature deals with certain problems treated in the bioethics literature, and that some of the work of bioethical writers like Daniel Callahan and Donald Warwick has been funded by the Population Council, of which Bernard Berelson is president. However, most of the population literature by sociologists grows out of another intellectual and social policy tradition, whose origins antedate those of bioethics, and its major authors belong to a demography-population social circle and social movement, rather than to the bioethics subculture.</page><page sequence="10">240 FOX hand, and biological, biomedical, philosophical, theological, and/or legal variables on the other, is requisite. Not many sociologists have this trained competence or seem willing to acquire it. It should also be said that the emerging field of bioethics has not been enthusiasti- cally welcoming to social scientists. One of the inadvertent consequences of the skewing of the field in the direction of philosophical and theological ethics is a tendency on the part of influential members of the bioethics circle to regard social science and its practitioners as insufficiently humanistic. A C. P. Snow-like "two cultures" split exists between the intellectual self-conceptions of the gatekeepers of bioethics and their tendency to view most social scientists, particularly sociologists, as excessively scientistic. Lawyers, biologists, and physicians in the bioethics group, as well as philosophers and theologians, share this perspective, which is institution- alized across the disciplines making the primary input to the bioethical debate and literature. Thus, the ethos of bioethics converges with that of sociology in a way that reinforces the tendency of sociologists to hold themselves aloof from this area of intellectual, moral, and politico-legal concern. The branch of sociology that one would expect to have the most affinity for an analysis of social and ethical implications of biomedical advance and technology is the sociology of medicine. And indeed, as will be seen, a number of the sociologist authors who have contributed to the bioethics literature are known for their work on medicine. However, taken as a whole, the sociology of medicine has paid little attention to topics of direct relevance to bioethics, such as the sociology of medical science; research and therapeutic innovation; the interplay between medicine, medi- cal science, religion, and magic in an advanced modern society; or the relationships between medicine and law in such a society. Rather, research and writing have been mainly devoted to the sociology of illness, medical care, the hospital, and the profession of medicine. Sociologists have published more about the patient than about the physician, the nurse, or other medical and paramedical professionals, and more about mental illness and its treatment than about physical illness. During these past ten years, when bioethics has been developing, sociologists of medicine have been most concerned with the sick role-its formulation by Talcott Parsons (1948, 1951, 1958, 1975; Parsons &amp; Fox 1952), and its phenomenology-the "labeling" of illness (Scheff 1966, 1975), the "medicalization of deviance" (Pitts 1968), and with the "professional dominance" and "organized autonomy" of physicians (Freidson 1970a,b). The literature of the past decade is a curious genre. Although it has roots in important theoretical and empirical works such as those of Parsons, Freidson, Scheff, and Goffman (1961), a good deal of what has been written in the sociology of medicine since the 1960s is social criticism rather than social science. In contrast to the literature of the 1950s, for example, which presented a rich array of concep- tual insights and firsthand empirical studies, many of the more recent publications are neither based on firsthand research, nor present original theoretical ideas. Rather, they repeatedly fault Parsons's notion of the sick role, decry the extension of the social stigmata and controls of illness to an increasing number of conditions and behaviors, denounce the monopolistic, self-regulating comportment of physi-</page><page sequence="11">ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY 241 cians, and deplore the attributes of American society that permit and encourage progressive medicalization. The Sociological-Bioethical Literature and Its Authors The handful of sociologists who have written bioethics-relevant articles and books are not uncritical of the health-illness-medicine complex as it is currently institution- alized in American society. However, in most cases, whatever criticisms they offer or recommendations they make grow out of the implications of empirical research that they or others have conducted. The number of sociologist authors who have published works that deal with the social, ethical, and existential concomitants of biomedical knowledge, technology, and their advance is so small that a nearly exhaustive list of them can easily be made. In alphabetical order, they are Bernard Barber [and with him, as coauthors, John J. Lally, Julia Loughlin Makarushka, and Daniel F. Sullivan (Barber 1970, 1973; Barber et al 1973; Lally &amp; Barber 1974)]; Daniel Bell (1973); Diana Crane (1969, 1975a,b,c; Crane &amp; Matthews 1969); Amitai Etzioni (1968, 1973a,b,c,d,e); Renee C. Fox (1957, 1959, 1960, 1970, 1974b,c; Fox &amp; Lief 1963; Fox &amp; Swazey 1974; Swazey &amp; Fox 1970; Parsons, Fox &amp; Lidz 1972); Barney G. Glaser &amp; Anselm Strauss (1965, 1968); Bradford H. Gray (1975a,b); Talcott Parsons [alone, and with Renee Fox and Victor M. Lidz (Parsons 1970; Parsons &amp; Lidz 1967; Parsons, Fox &amp; Lidz 1972)]; Roberta G. Simmons (Simmons, Fulton &amp; Fulton 1970; Simmons &amp; Najarian 1970; Simmons, Hickey, Kjellstrand &amp; Simmons 1971a,b; Simmons &amp; Simmons 1971; Simmons, Klein &amp; Thornton 1972); James R. Sorenson (1971, 1973a,b,c, 1974a,b); David Sudnow (1967); Judith P. Swazey11 (1971, 1974a,b; Swazey &amp; Fox 1970; Swazey &amp; Bessman 1971; Fox &amp; Swazey 1974); Richard M. Titmuss (1971); and Donald P. Warwick (1968, 1973, 1974a,b, 1975a,b,c; Warwick &amp; Kelman 1973). These authors are interconnected in various ways. Numerous of them received their graduate training at Columbia or Harvard, and/or have held teaching or research positions at these universities (Barber, Lally, Makarushka, Sullivan, Bell, Crane, Etzioni, Fox, Parsons, Lidz, Simmons, Swazey, and Warwick). In many instances, they were present on the same campus at overlapping times. Several of the authors are currently faculty members at the same colleges or universities (Barber and Makarushka at Barnard College; Barber and Etzioni at Columbia University; Crane, Fox, and Lidz at the University of Pennsylvania (where Parsons is currently a visiting professor); Parsons and Bell at Harvard University; Glaser and Strauss at the University of California Medical Center, San Francisco; and Sorenson and Swazey at Boston University. As their acknowledgments to one another in book prefaces, dedications and footnotes, as well as their coauthorships indicate, formal IIAlthough Judith P. Swazey is an historian of science and a biologist, a significant amount of her research and writing have been done in a sociological framework, and she is a faculty member in the Department of Socio-Medical Sciences at Boston University Medical School, which is sociological and anthropological in outlook.</page><page sequence="12">242 FOX and informal collaboration between different authors in this group has been exten- sive. In some instances, the work in progress, or already done by certain authors engendered and facilitated a project undertaken by another. To cite one such in- stance, Gray's book on Human Subjects in Medical Experimentation is a revised version of his doctoral dissertation written at Yale. As he states in the preface to his book, his "original interest in this area was stimulated by Diana Crane in her seminar in sociology of science at Yale." While planning the study on which his thesis and book are based, Gray spent time with the Research Group on Human Experimentation at Columbia University, composed of Barber, Lally, Makarushka, and Sullivan. They were gathering the data for their own book, Research on Human Subjects, and gave him the benefit of their experience to that point. Subsequently, Barber urged Gray to prepare his dissertation for publication and wrote the fore- word to his book. There are also a number of teacher-student chains in this group, like the Crane-Barber-Gray one. For instance, Parsons taught Barber, Fox, and Lidz when each was a graduate student and Barber taught Fox when she was an under- graduate. Fox, Swazey, Sorenson, and Warwick are all active members of the Hastings Institute of Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences, which provides them with face-to-face, as well as scholarly, contact. Both Barber and his colleagues, and Crane worked closely with the Russell Sage Foundation in the conception and execution of their respective books, particularly with Orville G. Brim Jr. and Howard E. Freeman. The Foundation published, as well as funded, their research. And finally, as might be expected, a considerable number of the authors in this group are known principally for their work in the sociology of medicine and/or science (Barber, Sullivan, Crane, Fox, Glaser, Strauss, Simmons, Sorenson, and Swazey). 12 This is not to imply that all the authors in this group are intellectually and interpersonally linked to one another in these ways. For example, Titmuss belongs to the British rather than to the American sociological tradition. Glaser and Strauss were trained at Chicago, Gray at Yale, Sorenson at Princeton, Sudnow at Berkeley, and Warwick at Michigan, rather than at Columbia or Harvard, and Bell has never written about medicine. But even on a surface level of analysis, there are enough similarities and interrelationships between sociologists who have contributed to the bioethics literature to suggest that they are not a randomized cross-section of the profession. The kind of a social circle they constitute, and the influence this has had on their work need further study. Unlike the bioethical articles and books of philosophers, theologians, physicians, biologists, and lawyers, most of the sociological writings in this area are based on empirical research. They present and analyze systematically collected primary as well as secondary data. Many of these sociological publications grow out of firsthand inquiries the authors themselves conducted, using survey, historical, or field meth- ods of research. The literature they have produced is rather evenly distributed 12Talcott Parsons is a special case in this regard. He is, of course, principally renowned as a theorist, but he is also one of the founders of the sociology of medicine.</page><page sequence="13">ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY 243 between so-called qualitative and quantitative approaches, and several studies have utilized both. The chief substantive topics on which the sociologist authors have concentrated are human experimentation, death and dying, organ transplantation and dialysis, and genetic screening and counseling. These are subjects that have evoked high public as well as professional interest in recent years and that, in contrast to the anticipated but still futuristic biomedical developments that have been causing concern (such as genetic engineering and behavior control) can be observed here and now. Sociologists have studied how human subjects and medical investigators, patients and their families, physicians and other medical professionals think, feel, and act in situations relevant to the illness-dying-research-therapy phenomena on which they have focused. They have described and analyzed the actual behavior of the participants in these settings, its collective patterns, the origins of these patterns, and how these behaviors are like and unlike what is generally believed to occur and what is considered to be ideal. In these respects, the sociological sector of the bioethical literature reflects the orientation and ethos of social research. It invites commentary only because it is strikingly dissimilar to the speculative, albeit system- atic, nature of most of the nonsociological bioethical writings, their greater attention to ideal than to actual patterns of behavior, and their heavy reliance on individual, rather than on institutional or aggregate case studies. Death and Dying The writings on death and dying include some of the earliest sociological explora- tions of a bioethically relevant field. They foreshadow what now seems to be a generalized American interest in how death is defined and experienced in this society, in the human as well as the technical features of the modern hospital (which, along with the nursing home, is the principal setting where death occurs), and in the degree and kind of control that the dying person, the family, and the medical team exert over the "dying trajectory" (Glaser &amp; Strauss 1968). A number of the sociological works that deal with death and dying provide detailed ethnographic accounts of what Glaser &amp; Strauss and Sudnow call the social organization of death work (Glaser &amp; Strauss 1968, Sudnow 1967), and the way it is structured by different services in various types of urban hospitals. Somewhat more material is presented on attitudes and behaviors of hospital staff members, particularly doctors and nurses, than on patients and their families; however, the stages of dying and mourning through which terminally ill patients and their rela- tives pass, their states of awareness (Glaser &amp; Strauss 1965), and their ways of coming to terms with their conditions (Fox 1959, Fox &amp; Swazey 1974) are not neglected. A common assumption in much popular and professional writing on death and dying by nonsociologists is that the denial of death is basic to American national character and culture. Given the frequency and conviction with which this point of view is stated, it is notable that none of the sociologist authors under review support this premise. Parsons &amp; Lidz explicitly argue against it (1967). However, all the</page><page sequence="14">244 FOX authors cited report on a number of conditions surrounding death in the hospital that create the impression of denial: the routinization and ritualization of the practices and procedures of hospital personnel; their outward display of efficiency, equanimity, and "do something" care; and the mutual pretext of unawareness that is often enacted by patient, family, and medical staff in the face of the uncertainties and anxieties of the dying process. These works are sensitive to the fact that the nurses and physicians who care for dying patients need special defenses and supports to help them maintain "detached concern" (Fox &amp; Lief 1963) in situations that normally arouse the deepest kind of anxiety and questioning about human suffering and mortality. Several authors give accounts of critical, symbolic cases-the dying child or youth; the suicidal, alco- holic, or "criminal" patient-that bring such questions of meaning and moral worth so acutely to the surface that institutionalized ways of dealing with death tempo- rarily break down, and with them the usual capacity of medical personnel to manage their feelings (Fox 1959, Sudnow 1967). However, all the authors seem to agree that by and large, the professional socialization process that nurses and physicians undergo and the social organization of the hospital and its daily round generate more detached than concerned care. Certain aspects of the socialization process and of the social structure of medical work are identified as particularly conducive to this process of emotional distancing and to the noncommunication and miscom- munication of the staff with colleagues, as well as dying patients and their kin that can result. Implicit in the conceptual framework of the sociological literature on death and dying is the assumption that if anything is to be done substantially to improve the ambiance of terminal care in the hospital, exhortation and conscious- ness raising will not be sufficient, and could even have unanticipated negative side effects. Rather, the medical socialization process will have to be altered in ways that affect latent as well as manifest attitudes and behavior patterns, and new organiza- tional arrangements and mechanisms will have to be devised and implemented. These are among the major recommendations that Glaser &amp; Strauss explicitly make (1968). They also advocate that "medical and nursing personnel should encourage public discussion of issues that transcend professional responsibilities for terminal care," especially the question of the circumstances under which various kinds of procedures for prolonging life should be initiated, and how long and vigorously they should be maintained (1968:258-59). With this last issue, the sociological literature opens into a consideration of the most basic cultural premises about life and death in American society. These premises, derived from the Judeo-Christian tradition, constitute a fundamental, "civil religion" substratum in the society. As formulated by Parsons, Fox &amp; Lidz (1972), this set of beliefs and values emphasizes that because human life is divinely given, it is inherently sacred and important, has absolute, inestimable worth and meaning, and should be protected and sustained. At the same time, these authors contend, this "gift of life" tradition implies that the death of the individual is not only inevitable but, "especially in the fullness of a complete life," is an obligatory way of reciprocating the original gift received (1972:37 1). This obligation to recipro- cate notwithstanding, the Parsons, Fox &amp; Lidz article, as well as the writings of</page><page sequence="15">ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY 245 Crane (1975a,b,c), Fox and Swazey (Fox &amp; Swazey 1974, Fox 1974), and Glaser &amp; Strauss all indicate that in recent years, the unqualified commandment to support and sustain life has become increasingly problematic in American society, particu- larly in the medical sector. The sanctity of life ethic has helped to push physicians, nurses and other medical professionals into a pugilistic tendency to combat death at any cost, and to define its occurrence as a personal and professional defeat. This heroically aggressive, "courage to fail" stance (Fox &amp; Swazey 1974) has been reinforced by the development of more powerfully effective forms of medical tech- nology that increase the medical team's ability to save and maintain life. However, some of the consequences of doing everything possible to keep all chronically afflicted and terminally ill patients indefinitely alive have come to be questioned. The material and psychic costs; the suffering that prolonging life under certain condi- tions may entail for the dying person, his (her) family and the medical team; and the allocation of scarce resources problems that such massive efforts pose for the entire society are now often discussed and debated. Affirmations about the right to die as well as the right to live, and about death with dignity are recurrently heard, along with queries about the quality of life of persons being maintained on artificial support systems or by other extraordinary means. A new operational definition of death (irreversible brain coma) has been proposed and is progressively being institu- tionalized. It codifies the position that although the heart may beat and respiration continue (either naturally or by artificial means), without neocortical activity and the cerebration it makes possible, essential human life does not exist. The corpus of sociological articles and books on death and dying suggests that these are all signs that a transition is taking place in American society from an absolute ethic based on the unconditional sanctity of life, to a more relativized ethic or what Weber would have called an ethic of responsibility premised on a socially as well as biologically defined conception of quality of life (Parsons, Fox &amp; Lidz 1972:402-9; Fox &amp; Swazey 1974:320-26). Diana Crane's study of what physicians do when they are faced with the treat- ment of critically ill patients documents this inference. She reports that a disparity has developed between the traditional medical ethic that advocates that treatment "be continued as long as life, defined in physiological terms, can be preserved" and the actual behavior of physicians (1975a:204). Based on extensive interviews that she conducted with physicians in several medical specialties, a total of 3189 question- naires completed by samples of internists, pediatricians, neurosurgeons, and pedia- tric heart surgeons, and on studies of the records of hospital patients, Crane concludes (1975a:199-200) that: ... physicians respond to the chronically ill or terminally ill patient not simply in terms of physiological definitions of illness but also in terms of the extent to which he is capable of interacting with others. The treatable patient is one who can interact or has the potential to interact in a meaningful way with others in his environment. The physically damaged salvageable patient whose life can be maintained for a considerable period of time is more likely to be actively treated than the severely brain-damaged patient or the patient who is in the last stages of terminal illness. The brain-damaged infant is also not defined as treatable by many physicians, since he lacks the potential to establish social</page><page sequence="16">246 FOX relationships with others. The unsalvageable infant is less likely to be treated than the salvageable infant, even if the latter is physically or mentally damaged. Consistent with the interpretation that physicians are using a social definition of life are the findings from this study which show that the family's attitude toward the brain-damaged child is an important influence upon the physician's decision to treat the child.... Although the data are not entirely consistent or conclusive on this point, it appears that social capacity rather than social value is the more important factor in the physician's decision to treat these patients. In other words, the patient's capacity or potential capacity to engage in social interaction is a more important factor in the decision to treat him than his social status or prestige. Like the other sociological authors, Crane feels that the implications of her study and of "new developments in related areas" ramify beyond the medical sector; that in changing its definition of life and death, American society is undergoing a "funda- mental (cultural) shift" (1975a: 206). However, she is concerned about some of the immediate consequences of the current stage of transition, with its "disparity be- tween formal and informal norms" regarding the treatment of critically ill patients. In her opinion, this normative discrepancy could create a reaction-formation re- sponse in the medical profession. It could lead physicians to "overstress ... the preservation of life at all costs," in an attempt to deny and control the degree of deviance from this injunction that already exists in medical practice. Crane's recom- mendation for what she considers to be this undesirable state of affairs is to "alter the formal norms" by developing medico-ethical "guidelines for the withdrawal of treatment with respect to certain specifically defined conditions" (1975a:204). What she advocates, then, as a controlled way of relaxing and qualifying the physician's absolute obligation to sustain life is not a general ethical code, but rather, concrete sets of guidelines such as those that define the condition under which irreversible coma and brain death (and thus the death of the person) can be said to have occurred. Medical Research on Human Subjects Experiment Perilous by Renee Fox bridges the sociological literature on death and on human experimentation. It also spans two quite different time periods in Ameri- can sociology, the 1950s and the 1970s. It was first published in 1959 and was reissued in 1974 in a paperback edition. On the one hand, this participant-observa- tion-based study of Ward F-Second, a clinical research unit in a renowned university hospital, is one of a number of pioneering, ethnographic studies of hospitals and hospital wards as social systems that were carried out in the 1950s. On the other hand, as Fox writes in her introduction to the paperback edition, there are several senses in which this work is "more contemporaneous now than it was at the time of its initial publication" (1959/1974:11). For, in contradistinction to the decade 1966-1976, in the period when the fieldwork for Experiment Perilous was done (1951-1954), "no first-hand sociological study of terminal illness, medical experi- mentation with human subjects, or the psychosocial dynamics of therapeutic inno- vation had ever been made. Not only was there no precedent for such an inquiry, but its legitimacy was questionable" (1959/1974:10). Furthermore, some of the medical research and therapeutic developments that took place on Ward F-Second</page><page sequence="17">ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY 247 25 years ago-notably, very early clinical trials with cardiac surgery, hemodialysis, and organ transplantation-are now in the forefront of bioethical discussion and of the contributions that sociologists are making to it. Experiment Perilous is essentially a study of the entwined problems of the patients and physicians of Ward F-Second, of their reciprocal stresses, and of the socially patterned ways that they evolved for coming to terms with these problems and stresses. Out of their common predicament of chronic and terminal illness, high medical uncertainty and risk, severe therapeutic limitation, and constant closeness to death; and in response to their dual, often conflicting roles of physician-investiga- tors and patient-subjects, the men of F-Second created a tragicomic community in which doctor and patient were collegially committed to medical research. In their more recent book Research On Human Subjects (1973), Barber, Lally, Makarushka &amp; Sullivan assert that in the universe of American institutional settings in which medical research with human subjects is carried out, the attributes of Ward F- Second are relatively rare. [Lally &amp; Barber's article, "The Compassionate Physi- cian" (1974), makes this claim in more explicit detail.] Their conclusions are based on a nationally representative questionnaire survey of 239 biomedical research institutions, and on a more intensive, comparative study (via 331 personal inter- views) conducted in a university hospital and research center on the one hand, and a community and teaching hospital on the other. Barber, Lally, and their colleagues found that in research situations where the procedures being tried are dramatically innovative, dangerous, or painful; where there is a continuing relationship between researchers and their subjects; and where the physician-investigators are responsible for caring for their subjects, who are also their patients, a Ward F-Second-type situation was likely to prevail. Under such circumstances, medical researchers do tend to be keenly aware of the risks and suffering to which they are exposing their subjects, humanly and personally con- cerned about them, and anguished by the research-therapy conflicts involved. It is in this kind of situation, too, that research physicians are most likely to live up to the highest ethical standards of human experimentation by treating their subjects as collaborators and co-adventurers, explaining the risks and benefits of the proce- dures that they ask them to undergo in scrupulous detail, making it clear to them that they can withdraw from the experiment at any time, and thereby obtaining from their subjects the most fully informed voluntary consent possible. But while acknowledging this special situation, Barber, Lally, Makarushka &amp; Sullivan contend that such "concern-producing factors" occur relatively infre- quently in biomedical research (1973:113): In most research projects ... the investigator is not faced with a decision about serious, life-threatening procedures for his patient-subjects.... there is ... evidence ... that there are mechanisms which protect investigators from emotional involvement in research by limiting their contact with their subjects. ... Much research is brief, involving simple measurements on large numbers of subjects. Much research could be, and some is, conducted without the knowledge and cooperation of the subjects. The patients' involve- ment is not necessarily conscious, long-term or painful.... (Thus,) only a minority of research projects have the characteristics of risk and patient contact which seem to make researchers aware of research ethics. ...</page><page sequence="18">248 FOX There is considerable agreement among the sociologists writing about medical experimentation that the values, attitudes, and behavior patterns of investigators and subjects are not only shaped by the interaction structures and ambience of the groups within which the research is conducted, but also by the patterned character- istics of what Fox and Swazey have called the process of "therapeutic innovation" (Fox &amp; Swazey 1974, Swazey 1974a). The three sets of phenomena that sociologist authors have identified as most strategic in this regard are problems of uncertainty and of the unknown that are inherent to medical research; the experiment-therapy or science and therapy dilemma that it entails; and the socially structured competi- tion and system of differential rewards that are involved both in the making of medical scientific discoveries and in the advancement of medical scientific careers. Bradford Gray (1975a) and Bernard Barber and his associates have focused their attention on the ways in which these and other aspects of the medical research context and role contribute to lax, even deviant standards and practices in investiga- tors' conduct with human subjects. Gray was especially impressed with the perva- sive inadequacies in the process of obtaining informed, voluntary consent from subjects that characterized the 54 projects at "Eastern University" Medical Center that he examined. In the labor-induction drug study, one of the two projects that he analyzed most intensively, out of the 51 patients involved as subjects, at the time that they began receiving an experimental drug, as many as 20 patients were un- aware that they were participants in research. On this project and on others that he explored, Gray found that the researchers had obtained many of the subjects' signatures on consent forms in a routinized, largely ritualistic way. Only "cursory, euphemistic, verbal" explanations were given to the subjects (1975a:221). A consid- erable number of them did not understand the procedures they had ostensibly agreed to undergo, the possible risks they entailed, or that they had had the option not to sign the consent form when they were asked to do so. In the labor-induction study, as in others, some subjects were not only persuaded, but pressured to partici- pate in the research project by young physicians on the house staff, acting on behalf of senior physicians conducting research, whom they were eager to please. And the quality of consent obtained from subjects who were relatively uneducated, of lower class status, clinic patients, and/or black was often dubious. In fact, persons with these social characteristics were most likely to fall into what Gray calls the category of "unaware subjects" (1975a: 128-39), and to be involved in projects where the risks were relatively high in proportion to the therapeutic benefits for the subjects them- selves or for other patients. Barber and his coauthors arrived at a similar finding in their study. Ward and clinic patients, they report, are more likely than private patients to be subjects of studies where the risks exceed the benefits. Furthermore, they add, "it is not at all clear from our data that . . . the sacrifice these patients make (provides) important scientific benefits," or that when researchers launched their high-risk studies and engaged subjects in them, they had such an intent or hope in mind (Barber et al 1973:55-57). Gray, Barber, and coauthors were especially interested in studying how various social control structures and processes affect medical researchers' sensitivity to issues of informed, voluntary consent and of the proper balance between benefit and</page><page sequence="19">ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY 249 risk, their ethical concern about their human subjects in these and other regards, and the way that they plan and actually conduct their experiments. The three major types of control that Gray, Barber et al consider are the professional socialization relevant to ethical research that physicians undergo; the patterns of informal in- teraction that characterize the collaborative groups and teams within which physi- cians generally carry out their research; and the peer group review of research with human subjects that has been made mandatory by numerous governmental and nongovernmental funding agencies during the past ten years. In many respects, Gray, Barber et al find each of these social control mechanisms inadequate, or in serious need of improvement or of more far-reaching changes, which they discuss in detail in the final chapters of their books. As this makes apparent, these books by Barber and Gray (and by Crane as well) all represent attempts to "achieve two different but interrelated purposes" (Barber et al 1973:185): First, . . . we hoped to make a contribution to sociological theory and understanding. And second, we hoped that the theory and understanding arrived at through our research would result directly in specific and useful suggestions for policy change and reform. Policy and Methodology Concerns The explicit commitment that these sociologists have made to the formulation of social criticism and policy merits comment, for this is a general, though not univer- sal, characteristic of the recent, bioethically relevant publications of sociologists. While cleaving to the conviction that their primary responsibility is to advance the theory, methodology, and knowledge base of sociology, a significant number of the sociologist authors who have been writing about bioethical topics seem to feel that they have the intellectual and social obligation to make policy suggestions based on their findings and analyses. This applied, critical, action- and change-oriented di- mension of their work appears to have several sources: the social relevance ethos that gained momentum in sociology in the 1960s and has continued into the 1970s; the degree to which bioethical issues like research with human subjects and death and dying have become matters of public interest and concern; the financial support and publishing outlet that organizations such as the Russell Sage Foundation have been providing for this sort of policy-directed research (Barber et al 1973; Crane 1975a; Katz, Capron &amp; Glass 1972; Katz &amp; Capron 1975); and these authors' shared preoccupation with the power of professions in American society and the impor- tance of insuring that they use it in a socially responsible way. Sociologists writing about the socioethical ramifications of biomedical progress have tended to see medicine as the quintessential case of such a powerful profession and of the prob- lems of social control it presents. As Bernard Barber and coauthors (1973:188) have put it: ... medicine is too important to be left to the doctors, science is too important to be left to the scientists, and biomedical research is too important to be left to the biomedical researchers. Because the consequences of professional power are too important to be left to the professionals, outsiders ask the kind of control that comes at least from having the</page><page sequence="20">250 FOX professionals make a reasonable effort to give a reasonable account of what they are doing. Immersed in their own special culture and activities, professionals often not only do not take the initiative in offering such accounts but are resistant to the requests of their clients that accounts be given... Based on their conviction that as informed outsiders they have probative insights to offer that grow out of their research findings, and out of their pre-research commitment to social system-oriented analysis and to particular paradigms such as Robert Merton's "social structure and anomie" typology, Gray, Barber et al offer their policy suggestions about medical socialization, scientific competition, research collaboration and peer-group review.13 Both of their books end with exhortations to the medical profession to work as hard on ethical problems as they have on medical scientific ones, even if that shift in priorities means slowing the tempo of biomedical advance. The Courage to Fail, by Fox &amp; Swazey (1974), deals with many of the same phenomena that concern Gray, and Barber and his coauthors, but it is a different genre of work in methodology, style, and analytic intent. It deals with medical research on human subjects in the framework of a larger interest in the process of therapeutic innovation. The book is built around an exploration of transplantation and dialysis, which is viewed as paradigmatic of the range of medical and social phenomena that accompany biomedical research and its clinical application. Trans- plantation and dialysis are also seen as both empirically and symbolically associated with a number of the metamedical, "collective conscience" issues with which American society seems to be grappling, and which are central to the bioethics movement. Because the authors are especially interested in the sociology of medical science, they concentrate somewhat more attention on research physicians engaged in the transplantation and dialysis enterprise than on patient-subjects and their families. However, firsthand data on transplant and dialysis patients are presented throughout the book, and Chapter 1 ("Gift Exchange and Gate Keeping," pp. 5-39) and Chapter 10 ("Ernie Crowfeather," pp. 280-315) are built on patient and family case materials. The entire book is composed of cases ranging in size and scope from those of individual patients, physicians, nurses, relatives, etc, to whole medical centers. These data were gathered over a period of four years, through field research (participant observation, face-to-face interviews, analysis of documents, etc), in dialysis and transplant centers located in various regions of the country. Two centers were studied more continuously and intensively than the others during this time. Fox &amp; Swazey present what Clifford Geertz has called a "thick" analytic and interpretive description of these many-faceted dialysis/transplantation, human ex- "3Bradford Gray is currently carrying out a major research project in a context that is explicitly addressed to policy analysis, recommendations, and change. He is a member of the staff of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, where he is conducting a national survey of the way that medical and nonmedical institutions review research conducted with human subjects. None of the Commis- sioners are sociologists and Gray is the only sociologist staff member.</page><page sequence="21">ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY 251 perimentation, therapeutic innovation phenomena, and of the social milieus in which they occur. Both because the work is ethnographic and because it is cultural as well as social structural in its theoretical orientation, it sets forth to a greater extent than the Barber, Crane, and Gray books the tapestry of dilemmas and ambivalences that clinical medical research and human experimentation entail. And although in certain regards it is as piercingly critical of the comportment of the medical profession in particular kinds of situations (see, for example, Chapter 7, "The Case of the Artificial Heart," pp. 149-21 1), it suggests that there may be some irreducible elements in those situations that cannot easily be changed by enlightened good will, a reformed medical socialization process, or even by new social structural arrangements. It is of some "sociology of sociology" interest to note that a work with these methodological and conceptual-interpretive attributes is more likely to be regarded by reviewers as a biased and politically conservative work that has "uncritically ... adopt(ed) the medical perspective," presenting research physicians as romantic, ethically sensitive "heroes,"14 than the type of study that the Barber, Crane, and Gray books represent. In addition, it has qualities that evoke another, more subtle set of allegations:15 ... viewing the terrain of illness from the seemingly heroic stance of the research physi- cian doing battle at the furthermost frontiers of clinical practice obscures the pained everyday world of the patients. ... Rather, the physician-borne perspective does not encourage (the authors) to conceptually chart and amplify this underworld of frustration, embitterment, dismemberment, and, on occasion, even triumph.... Theoretical, methodological, schools-of-sociology, and even world-view issues and differences are involved here that clearly go beyond the scope of this review. Transplantation and Dialysis The Courage to Fail is the one book-length sociological work about dialysis and transplantation that has thus far been published. The book on kidney transplanta- tion that Roberta Simmons is writing is not yet available, but its perspective is prefigured in her numerous coauthored articles (Simmons et al 1970, 1971, 1971 a,b, 1972). She is particularly interested in the role that the family and the physician play in the complex, often poignant process of decision making that the selection of a kidney donor and recipient entails. She also tried to trace out the long-range as well as the immediate psychosocial consequences of this extraordinary exchange for donors, recipients, their families, and the transplantation team. In addition to her microdynamic analysis of these phenomena, like Fox and Swazey she has systemat- ically reflected on some of the larger societal problems that transplantation poses. In their writings about the phenomena associated with transplantation and dial- ysis, Simmons, Swazey, and Fox (Swazey &amp; Fox 1970, Fox 1970, Fox &amp; Swazey '4Marcia Millman 1975.

Sociol. 81:417-20.</page><page sequence="22">252 FOX 1974, Swazey 1974a, Fox 1974b) highlight several interrelated socioethical issues integral to these extraordinary modes of treatment: "gift of life," quality of life, and allocation of scarce resources concerns. The "gift-exchange" aspects of organ transplantation, Simmons, Swazey, and Fox agree, constitute its most distinctive feature. A vital organ is donated by one individ- ual in order to give life to another person who is terminally ill. Like other forms of gift exchange, organ donation is structured by a set of norms that shape the feelings and behavior of both donors and recipients. These are the norms that Marcel Mauss identified and analyzed in his classic monograph The Gift (1954): the obliga- tions to give, to receive, and to repay. Failure to live up to any of these expectations produces social strains that affect the giver, the receiver, and those associated with them. As Simmons, Swazey, and Fox show, because a live as well as a cadaveric organ donation is an option in the case of renal transplantation, the dynamics of the gift exchange involved can be especially intricate.16 When a live renal transplant is contemplated, the members of the prospective recipient's family face strong norma- tive pressure to offer a gift of a kidney. A live transplant from a donor who is genetically related to the recipient and is a "good tissue match" has a better medical prognosis than a cadaveric transplant.17 In addition, the integrity, closeness, and generosity of the family and each of its members are symbolically involved in the willingness of kin to give of themselves to their dying relative in this ultimate, life-maintaining way. Under these circumstances, the possibility of a coerced or self-coerced gift of a kidney by a family member is sufficiently great for medical teams to have felt obliged to devise gatekeeping mechanisms that help them elimi- nate relatives from donorship who are subject to an inordinate amount of inner or outer pressure to give a kidney. The terminally ill patient who is offered the gift of a live kidney from a candidate-donor is under complementary normative pressure to accept it. To refuse to do so is not only life-denying in the biomedical sense, but also implies a rejection of the person who offered the live kidney and of the family unit to which the donor and recipient both belong. If the live transplant does take place, then in keeping with Mauss' paradigm, there is a sense in which the donor- recipient relationship takes on what Fox and Swazey have called a "tyrannical" dimension. The donor has made a priceless gift; the recipient has received and '6Because the kidneys are paired vital organs and one kidney can safely do the work of two, the loss of one kidney is not life-threatening. It is for this reason that the medical profession and the larger society of which it is part permit live as well as cadaveric kidney transplants to take place. The live transplantation of any other vital organ is forbidden, since its removal would cause the death of the donor. It is interesting that the desire to donate a singular vital organ is defined as unacceptably self-destructive or suicidal, rather than as a noble act of sacrifice. 17The prognosis with a live kidney transplant that is a good tissue match is better than with a cadaveric transplant because there is less likelihood that a rejection reaction will occur rapidly and with a severity that jeopardizes the functioning of the implanted organ. However, with the exception of the case of a transplant between identical twins, the eventual rejection of the transplanted organ is inevitable.</page><page sequence="23">ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY 253 accepted an inherently unreciprocable gift from the donor. The transcendent mean- ing of what has been interchanged can unite them in ways that reinforce their solidarity and enhance their mutual self-esteem without jeopardizing their auton- omy. But it is also possible that because of the unrepayable nature of the gift that binds them one to the other, the giver and the receiver may find themselves locked in a creditor-debtor vise that constricts their independence and their ability to relate to others. Swazey and Fox attach more importance to the "tyranny of the gift" concomi- tants of transplantation than does Simmons, and to the psychosocial suffering that they can involve for donors, recipients, and their families. In their view, these occur frequently, in heart and liver, as well as kidney transplants, and regardless of whether the organ donated is a live or a cadaveric one. (In the latter case a compara- ble bond is forged between the family of the deceased donor, the recipient, and his or her relatives.)18 Fox and Swazey are also more impressed than Simmons with the anthropomorphic phenomena that accompany transplantation. However animistic it may appear to be, they report, the transfer of a vital organ from one person to another often evokes the at once apprehensive and hopeful belief on the part of the recipient that along with the organ, he (she) is receiving some of the physical, social, and psychic qualities of the person who donated it. This sense that part of the donor's self has been transmitted to the recipient appears to be most pronounced with cardiac transplants, perhaps because of the special symbolic and religious meaning of the human heart in Western, Judeo-Christian tradition. Simmons does not seem to have observed many examples of these "tyrannical" and an- thropomorphic attributes of transplantation. This may be because her field research has been confined to one medical center (Minnesota) and because she has been exclusively concerned with kidney transplants. It may also be an artifact of her greater interest in the sociodynamics of transplantation than in its psychodynamics, or its cultural symbolism and meaning. Fox and Swazey analyze hemodialysis as well as transplantation in a gift- exchange framework. Whether dialysis (the use of the artificial kidney machine) is conducted in a medical center or at home, they explain, it entails the continuous exchange of life for death through the donation of time, energy, skill, and concern by persons who help run the kidney machine and attend the dialysis patient. In the case of home dialysis, this exchange is all the more remarkable because it requires and permits a lay person (usually the patient's spouse) to assume an unprecedented amount of responsibility for operating a complex life-support system. As a conse- quence, home dialysis in particular confronts patients with the problem of receiving and reciprocating a recurrent gift of life. The biomedical as well as the psychosocial side effects and sequellae of transplan- tation and dialysis raise a series of quality-of-life questions to which Simmons '8Out of their gradual recognition that the identification of the family of a deceased donor, the recipient, and his or her family may be psychologically injurious to them all, most transplant teams in the United States now keep the identity of the donor and the recipient anonymous.</page><page sequence="24">254 FOX alludes, and which Fox and Swazey discuss in detail. Underlying these questions is the immutable fact that no matter how well a patient seems to be adjusting to life with dialysis or transplantation, he is chronically dying. The gift-exchange phenomena and the quality-of-life issues related to dialysis and transplantation have implications for the third set of socioethical issues treated by Simmons, Swazey, and Fox: the allocation of scarce resources problems that these treatments present. On the most microscopic level, questions arise about whether the net balance of suffering, reprieve, and well-being for individual dialysis and transplant patients and their families justify the investment and expenditure of money, equipment, technical competence, personnel, time, hospital space, vital organs, and human concern that these particular ways of keeping terminally ill persons alive entail. On the more macroscopic level, two clusters of issues emerge. First, what proportion of such inherently scarce, precious resources should be allotted to dialysis and transplantation, as compared to other medical therapies, the treatment of other diseases, preventive medical procedures, medical research, or medical education? And second, how much should the society invest in the health- illness-medicine sector as a whole, relative to other needed and valued activities? The case of hemodialysis and kidney transplantation suggests that even if it were possible to provide the funds, materiel, professional skill, and human care to make such treatments available to all who need them, this would still not resolve many of the scarce resource problems associated with such quasi-experimental, psy- chically and fiscally expensive, life-sustaining, but not curative modes of treatment. In 1972, Public Law 92-603 was passed, which extended financial coverage under Medicare to the treatment costs of dialysis and kidney transplants. This legislation has not solved the resources problems that existed prior to its implementation. And it has opened up new, largely unanticipated scarce resources, quality-of-life and gift-exchange questions. Fox and Swazey (1974:326-27, 336-37) and other social scientists are only beginning to study their implications.'9 Laced through the writings of sociologists on death and dying, therapeutic inno- vation, human experimentation, hemodialysis, and transplantation is the ever-pre- sent question of who should have the responsibility and authority to make the kinds of decisions that each of these biomedical situations entails. As Katz &amp; Capron point out (1975:1-2), these decisions "exemplify the 'tragic choices' " that not only face individuals, but the society as a whole, in "many areas ... besides medical care." The roles that the physician-investigator, the patient-subject, the family, the profes- sions, and the state can and should play in this momentous decision making are currently being debated and reformulated in American society. The literature under review in this article both reflects and contributes to that process. Another overall characteristic of at least the sociological sector of this literature is that a particular set of concepts has played a major role in the analyses developed '"I discussed the post-Public Law 92-603 dialysis and kidney transplant situation in some detail last year, at a Clinicosociologic Conference held at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. These remarks have been published in "Long-Term Dialysis" 1975. Am. J. Med. 59:702-12.</page><page sequence="25">ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY 255 by the authors who have written on these biomedical and bioethical subjects. The principal concepts that they have used (in addition to values, norms, statuses, roles, institutions, socialization, and the like that are the building blocks of any sociologi- cal analysis) are uncertainty, detatched concern, the gift and gift exchange, the experiment-therapy dilemma, and structures and processes of social control. The repetition of these concepts in the literature derives from several sources: their applicability to certain phenomena and patterns that recur in the empirical data under examination; the current state and orientation of sociological theory; the training that this group of sociologist authors received in the limited circle of graduate departments of sociology cited earlier; and the formal and informal influ- ence that these writers have had on one another. Applied Human Genetics The final substantive area to which sociologists dealing with biomedical advance and its implications have turned their attention is applied human genetics. This is still a sketchily developed field of sociological reflection and inquiry. James Sorenson has been attempting to delineate its parameters (1971, 1973a,b) and has written the only articles on sociological aspects of genetic screening and genetic counseling that have thus far been published (1973a, 1974a,b). Judith Swazey (who is now doing col- laborative research with Sorenson on screening and counseling) has written a case study of the passage of laws in 41 states that mandate testing newborn infants for phenylketonuria (PKU), a hereditary metabolic disorder that may cause severe mental retardation (Swazey &amp; Bessman 1971a, Swazey 1971b). Amitai Etzioni has published a book entitled Genetic Fix, which is not easy to classify. In his preface to it, he explains its form and intent in this way (1973a:9-12): ... This book is not primarily a chronicle of new scientific developments; rather, it focuses on your right to know of opportunities and their consequences, your right to be in on the decisions thrust upon us, your right to decide if you want to administer the genetic fix to yourself, your next child, and-with other fellow citizens-to a nation's biological inheritance and future.... To highlight that we are in the initial phase of the age of genetic engineering, I refer to a genetic "fix"; we can now tamper with our biological inheritance, both fix it where it went wrong, and improve it (author's italics). . . . This somewhat personal volume deals chiefly with what I learned and felt when I participated in an international meeting of experts that reviewed the new scientific breakthroughs, the foundations of tomorrow's technology. It also deals with what I have tried to do about all this and how far I have gotten (not very far, let me tell you right away). Despite the disparate nature of the sociological work thus far done on human genetics and its still fragmentary state, the three social scientists who have written in this area have all focused on certain features of the current genetics situation. This is a dynamic area of frontier research (Taviss 1971:25) in biomedicine, they empha- size, that has the powerful potential to "alter man's role in evolution. ... Man is no longer limited to passive acceptance of all inherited characteristics but is rapidly expanding his technological capacity to include the active treatment, selection and elimination of many individual genetic attributes" (Sorenson 1971:1). At the same time, the field of genetics is so fraught with uncertainty that even geneticists disagree</page><page sequence="26">256 FOX about how advanced their research is now or is likely to be in the future, and about what dangers and benefits may ensue from some of the research procedures they are using or contemplating, as well as from the new knowledge and techniques that these may eventually bring forth. Against this state-of-the-art background, Etzioni, Sorenson, and Swazey have been concerned with three types of social control problems: controls to help implement already existing genetic knowledge and tech- niques; controls to regulate their human application; and what Taviss has called "anticipatory social controls" (1971:26) to forestall developments in genetic re- search and engineering that might have noxious, even perilous biological, psycholog- ical, social, and cultural consequences. As the foregoing implies, the area of genetics (like that of behavior control) tends to evoke deep apprehensions about the poten- tialities that developments in this field may have for "dangerous" tampering with the natural order, and for "sinister" politico-biological manipulation of the popula- tion by government and/or scientific groups. Etzioni, Sorenson, and Swazey are mindful of these possibilities and of the specters they arouse. At the same time they are concerned that controls instituted over genetic research, treatment, and engi- neering not be unduly hasty or subversive of the potential benefits that may come from advances in basic and applied genetics. Primary among the social control mechanisms that these authors consider is what Etzioni calls a "health ethics commission"-an interdisciplinary body whose job would be to study and make binding recommendations about the social and ethical, as well as the biological and medical implications of genetic and other forms of biomedical advance;20 biomedical legislation, such as the PKU laws, which Swazey judges to be "premature ... given the state of our knowledge about the nature and management of inherited metabolic disorders" (1971b:927-28); and the calling of a moratorium on certain types of genetic research or experimental clinical procedures whose consequences are con- sidered to be too unpredictable or hazardous (Swazey &amp; Fox 1970; Fox 1974b: 459-65).21 Genetic Screening and Counseling The second set of phenomena with which the small body of sociological writings on human genetics deals is genetic screening and counseling. Sorenson is the princi- 20Since the publication of Etzioni's book Genetic Fix, the kind of commission he enthusiasti- cally advocates has found at least one exemplification in the establishment of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research that was created under the National Research Act of July 1974. 2'A rather remarkable moratorium deferring research that entails inserting either new bacterial or viral material into bacteria (particularly Escherichia coli, a common inhabitant of the human intestines and throat) that could infect human beings was called by molecular biologists (members of the Committee on Recombinant DNA Molecules of the Assembly of Life Sciences of the National Research Council) in July 1974. They feared the unpredictably hazardous bioconsequences for humans. In May 1976, this self-imposed moratorium was still in effect, while the biological community was trying to work out guidelines for containing experiments with recombinant DNA.</page><page sequence="27">ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY 257 pal author here. He has begun to ask some preliminary, sociologically framed questions about the contours and consequences of the two new roles involved in this area, those of genetic counselor and counselee. Sorenson has been interested in the personal and professional backgrounds of counselors, their value orientations, and their attitudes; the social contexts within which counseling is done; the processes by which clients are referred or self-referred to counselors; the experiences and expectations that they bring to the counseling process; the structure and dynamics of the counselor-counselee relationship-its cognitive and attitudinal content, and the ways that it is like and unlike the traditional medical professional-patient rela- tionship; and in the marriage, reproductive, parenting, and family decisions that counselees eventually make-how they feel about these decisions, and what role the counseling transaction has played both in the formulation of these decisions and the meaning they have for counselees. As Sorenson appreciates, the counseling process takes place in a situation of high uncertainty concerning the exact nature of the roles involved, and the reliability and validity of the genetic predictions made. In the present state of genetic knowledge, in most cases the only kind of scientific and technical information that the counselor has available for counselees are probability statements about the chances of having a child with a specific genetic disorder, or probability-risk appraisals of the implications of already having given birth to a child with such a condition. Out of these systematically tentative estimates and the way they are conveyed to counselees come decisions as momentous as whether or not a couple will try to have children, whether a fetus will be brought to term or an abortion sought, and whether a family will care for and raise a child born with a severe genetic disorder or defect, or will place him (her) in an institution. The consequences of these awesome decisions for individuals, couples, children, families, particular groups in the population, medicine and the medical profession, the "gene pool," and for the social structure and value system of the entire society has only begun to be explored. Societal Significance of Biomedical and Bicethical Developments Finally, what is the overall societal significance of these various biomedical develop- ments, their effects, and the concerned interest that they have evoked? Sociologists have offered three sorts of answers to these questions. Daniel Bell (1973) would say that American society has entered its "post-indus- trial" phase, in which the "majority of the labor force is no longer engaged in agriculture or manufacturing but in services, which are defined, residually, as trade, finance, transport, health, recreation, research, education, and government"; the "professional and technical class" has become "preeminent"; "theoretical knowl- edge" is the "source of innovation and of policy formation for the society"; increas- ingly, "technological growth" is planned, assessed, and controlled; and a new "intellectual technology" has developed (1973:12-33). In such a post-industrial, essentially "technocratic society," Bell writes, "the disjunction of culture and social structure is bound to widen" (1973:480):</page><page sequence="28">258 FOX The historic justifications of bourgeois society-in the realms of religion and character -are gone. The traditional legitimacies of property and work become subordinated to bureaucratic enterprises that can justify privilege because they can turn out material goods more efficiently than other modes of production. But a technocratic society is not enno- bling. Material goods provide only transient satisfaction or an individual superiority over those with less. Yet one of the deepest human impulses is to sanctify their institutions and beliefs in order to find a meaningful purpose in their lives and to deny the meaning- lessness of death. A post-industrial society cannot provide a transcendent ethic-except for the few who devote themselves to the temple of science. And the antinomian attitude plunges one into a radical autism which, in the end, dirempts (sic) the cords of community and the sharing with others. The lack of a rooted moral belief is the cultural contradiction of the society, the deepest challenge to its survival. Richard Titmuss's analysis and societal vision are quite different. The starting point of his book, The Gift Relationship (1971), is human blood. It is a study of the "characteristics of those who give, supply or sell blood, and (it) analyzes in compara- tive terms blood transfusion and donor systems and national statistics of supply, demand, and distribution particularly in Britain and the United States." Using human blood and its mode of donation and receipt as both symbolic and indicative of larger questions of value, belief, and social policy, Titmuss argues against the "end of ideology" outlook of writers like Bell. "This study, in one small sector of human affairs," he states, "disputes both the death of ideology and the philistine resurrec- tion of economic man in social policy. It is thus concerned with the values we accord to people for what they give to strangers; not what they get out of society" (1971:13- 14). For Titmuss, the development of advanced biomedical procedures like blood transfusion demonstrates the practical necessity as well as the ethical imperative that the "freedom" and "right to give" in material and nonmaterial terms, to one's "stranger" as well as to one's "brother" be fostered by social policy. "Freedom from disability is inseparable from altruism," he concludes (1971:237-46). He also implies that certain forms of biomedical advance provide new potentialities for such altru- ism and freedom. Like Bell, Fox &amp; Swazey (1974) believe that American medicine and American society may be entering a new stage of modernity, but their study of organ transplan- tation and dialysis and their analysis of the larger biomedical and bioethical develop- ments of which these are a part lead them to a societal interpretation that is closer to Titmuss's than to Bell's (1974:334): "The theme of the gift, of freedom and obligation in the gift, of generosity and self-interest in giving reappear in our society like the resurrection of a motif long forgotten," Marcel Mauss wrote. Organ transplantation is one recent development that has again brought such issues of gift exchange and social solidarity prominently into view. Transplantation and hemodialysis also center on problems of uncertainty, meaning, life and death, scar- city, and intervention in the human condition. This is where the ultimate significance of these therapeutic innovations ... is to be found. And these questions, with which the "new biology" and medicine more generally are preoccupied, are a part of changing modern society that is increasingly concerned with such ethical and existential matters in many different domains.</page><page sequence="29">ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY 259 Literature Cited American Hospital Association. 1972.
