         <p>Agency might initially be understood as the relatively flexible wielding of means toward ends. For example, one can use a range of tools to achieve a specific goal, or one can use a specific tool to achieve a range of goals. In this way, flexibility may involve having lots of options open or having a strong say in which particular option will be acted on. And to say that one entity has more agency than another entity is to say that it has more flexibility—relatively more means and ends to choose from (in some given environment, or under some given conditions). For example, in contrast to other animals, humans seem to have a much wider array of both means and ends—where these may be alternately framed as tools and goals, beliefs and desires, or knowledge and value. Finally, with this flexibility usually comes accountability: the more agency one has over some process, the more one can be held responsible for its outcome and thereby be subject to praise or blame, reward or punishment, pride or shame.</p>
         <p>With regard to such human‐specific modes of flexibility and accountability, the classical tradition has given us several key ideas.1 First, humans make themselves, both individually and collectively. Negatively viewed, this means that their behavior is not subject to the same laws as the physical world more generally (they become relatively unpredictable); positively viewed, it means that they may have relatively unmediated access to the principles underlying their own behavior. Second, humans engage in this self‐creation under conditions that are not of their own choosing. Positively viewed, this conditional mediation may be understood as a “tradition” or “source”; negatively viewed, it may be understood as a “structure” or “shackles.” Third, humans have some species‐specific capacity that allows for this condition‐mediated self‐creation. This capacity is sometimes understood as a faculty or organ (imagination, mind, <italic>langue</italic>, consciousness, etc.) and sometimes as a facility or ergon (intersubjectivity, semiosis, culture, <italic>parole</italic>, dialogue, etc.). And finally, humans have an ethical responsibility not to let this capacity lie dormant and thus to seize control of the mediating conditions under which they create themselves.2</p>
         <p>The modern tradition has also given us several key ideas regarding agency, and they relate to the classical tradition in crosscutting ways (cf. Ahearn 2001<italic>a</italic>; Colapietro 1989). First, agency is understood as a kind of inherent human capacity, sometimes phrased as an instinct for hope or rebellion and sometimes as a faculty such as free will or choice. Such ideas are often as disheartening as they are empowering. For example, paraphrasing Gorky, conditions will never be so good that human beings will not yearn or struggle for something better, and, paraphrasing Sartre, man is condemned to choose. Second, agency is understood as a kind of resistance or reactance. From dragging one’s heels to putting up one’s fists and from obstinacy to insurgency, this sense of agency presupposes some system or antagonist that one is resisting or reacting to—be it the patriarchy, the oligarchy, the corporation, the status quo, the “man,” the military industrial complex, capitalism, colonialism, globalization, Satan, temptation, ignorance, illiteracy, injustice, communism, or one’s penchant for drink. And finally, agency is understood as a kind of mediating relationality. This last sense of agency is the most interesting and is basically a restatement of the classical tradition: we make ourselves, but not under conditions of our own choosing. This might be understood as Gramscian hegemony: having no choice about the field of options within which one may freely choose. It might be understood as a kind of two‐stroke functionalism: we desire to produce that which produces our desire. And it might be understood in terms of structuration or practice theory: the ways in which an interaction‐structuring system is continually restructured in interaction (cf. Giddens 1979, 66, and Bourdieu 1977 [1972]).</p>
         <p>Finally, there is the Baconian tradition, in which agency might be understood as just another word for knowledge and power. To paraphrase Francis Bacon—and taking the term nature to include “second nature”—if the task of knowledge is to find for a given nature the source of its coming‐to‐be, the task of power is to superinduce on a given body a new nature (Bacon 2000 [1620], 102). Michel Foucault’s (1995) famous distinction between <italic>savoir</italic> and <italic>pouvoir</italic> is grounded in this tradition, as is Ian Hacking’s (1993) distinction between representation and intervention. In this way, modern understandings of science and technology are fundamentally related to various traditions of agency.</p>
         <p>In this essay, the foregoing ideas of flexibility and accountability, on the one hand, and knowledge and power, on the other, are brought together to theorize agency in terms of a Peircean‐based theory of meaning. In particular, <italic>residential agency</italic>, which is closest to “power” and “choice,” will be defined as the degree to which one can (1) control the expression of a sign (e.g., determine where and when it may be expressed), (2) compose a sign‐object relation (e.g., determine what object a sign stands for and/or which sign stands for that object), and (3) commit to an interpretant of this sign‐object relation (e.g., determine what effect the expression of the sign will have so far as it stands for that object). <italic>Representational agency</italic>, which is closest to “knowledge” and “consciousness,” will be defined as the degree to which one can (1) thematize a process (e.g., determine what we talk about), (2) characterize a feature of this theme (e.g., determine what we say regarding what we talk about), and (3) reason with this theme‐character relation (e.g., determine what we conclude from, or use to conclude, what we say regarding what we talk about). In short, if residential agency involves having power over social, semiotic, and material processes, representational agency involves having knowledge about social, semiotic, and material processes.</p>
         <p>In this way, agency will be defined as two sets of three distinct dimensions, each variable by degree. Each of these dimensions will be motivated by a particular understanding of meaning. Various degrees of agency along any one of these dimensions will be seen to depend on semiotic properties of signs, social properties of semiotic communities, and cognitive properties of signers. Accountability will be seen to scale with the degree of agency one has over each of these dimensions. And, as implied in these definitions, agency will be shown not to necessarily (or even usually) inhere in specific people: the “one” in question can be distributed over time (now and then), space (here and there), unit (superindividual and subindividual), number (one and several), entity (human and nonhuman), and individual (Tom and Jane). Thus agency will be seen to involve processes which are multidimensional, graduated, and distributed.</p>
         <p>The next section introduces the key components of a Peircean‐based theory of meaning: sign, object, interpretant; iconic, indexical, symbolic; affective, energetic, representational. These terms and their interrelations will form the backbone of this theory. The following section defines residential agency and exemplifies its key dimensions. The next treats representational agency and relates it to Boasian notions such as “consciousness” and the nature of epistemology more generally. The next relates residential and representational agency to accountability. It treats the ways in which one’s responsibility for some process relates to one’s degree of agency over that process and the ways in which communities differ in regard to their construal of this relation.</p>

         <title>The Meaning of Meaning</title>
         <p>Semiotics is the study of semiosis, or “meaning,” a process which involves three components: <italic>signs</italic> (whatever stands for something else), <italic>objects </italic>(whatever a sign stands for), and <italic>interpretants </italic>(whatever a sign creates insofar as it stands for an object) (table 1). In particular, any <italic>semiotic process </italic>relates these three components in the following way: a sign stands for its object, on the one hand, and its interpretant, on the other, in such a way as to make the interpretant stand in relation to the object corresponding to its own relation to the object (Kockelman 2005; and see Peirce 1934, 8.332).3 What is at issue in meaningfulness, then, is not one relation between a sign and an object (qua “standing for”) but rather a relation between two such relations (qua “correspondence”). The logic of this relation between relations is shown in figure 1.<table-wrap id="tb1" position="float" seq="1">

         <p>For example, <italic>joint attention</italic> is a semiotic process. In particular, turning to observe what someone else is observing or turning to look where someone else is pointing involves an interpretant (a change of attention), an object (what the other person is attending to, or pointing toward), and a sign (the other person’s direction of attention or gesture that directs attention). As Mead (1934) noted, any <italic>interaction </italic>is a semiotic process. For example, if I pull back my fist (first phase of an action, or the sign), you duck (reaction, or the interpretant) on the assumption that my next move (second phase of action, or the object) will be to punch you. Generalizing interaction, <italic>the pair‐part structures</italic> of everyday interaction—the fact that questions are usually followed by answers, offers by acceptances, commands by undertakings, assessments by agreements, and so forth—consist of semiotic processes in which two components (the sign and interpretant) are foregrounded. In particular, a type of utterance (or action) gives rise to another type of utterance (or action) insofar as it is understood to express a proposition (or purpose).</p>
         <p>Indeed, the constituents of so‐called material culture are semiotic processes (Kockelman 2006<italic>a</italic>). For example, an <italic>affordance </italic>is a semiotic process whose sign is a natural feature, whose object is a purchase, and whose key interpretant is an action that heeds that feature or an instrument that incorporates that feature (to the extent that the feature “provides purchase”). For example, walking carefully over a frozen pond (as an action) is an interpretant of the purchase provided by ice (as an affordance) insofar as such a form of movement heeds the slipperiness of ice. An <italic>instrument </italic>is a semiotic process whose sign is an artificial entity, whose object is a function, and whose key interpretant is an action that wields that entity or another instrument that incorporates that instrument (to the extent that it “serves a function”). For example, a knife (as an instrument) is an interpretant of the function served by steel (as another instrument) insofar as such a tool incorporates the hardness and sharpness of steel. And an <italic>action </italic>is a semiotic process whose sign is a controlled behavior, whose object is a purpose, and whose key interpretant is another action that reacts to that action (qua interaction), an instrument that is realized by that action or a subsequent action (by the same actor) that incorporates that action. For example, a pie (as an instrument) provides an interpretant of the purpose of baking (as an action) insofar as it is the realization (or “objectification”) of the telos of baking.</p>
         <p>It is apparent from these examples that signs can be eye‐directions, pointing gestures, utterances, controlled behaviors, environmental features, and artificial entities. Objects can be the focus of attention, purposes, propositions, and functions. And interpretants can be other utterances, changes in attention, reactions, instruments, and heeding and wielding actions. Very few of these interpretants are “in the minds” of the interpreters, yet all of these semiotic processes embody properties normally associated with mental entities: attention, desire, purpose, propositionality, thoughts, and goals. Very few of these signs are addressed to the interpreters (in the sense of purposely expressed for the sake of their interpretants), and therefore most semiotic processes (such as wielding an instrument) are not intentionally communicative. The interpretant component of each of these semiotic processes is itself the sign component of an incipient semiotic process, and therefore the threefold relationality continues indefinitely (a point which will be seen to have fundamental implications for the distribution of agency).</p>
         <p>Given the definition of semiotic process offered above, the object of a sign is really that to which all (appropriate and effective) interpretants of that sign correspondingly relate (Kockelman 2005). Objects, then, are relatively abstract entities by definition. They should not be confused with “objects” in the Cartesian sense of <italic>res extensa</italic>, nor should they be confused with the “things” that words seem to stand for.4 Indeed, it is best to think of the object as a <italic>correspondence‐preserving projection</italic> from all interpretants of a sign. It may be more or less precise and more or less consistent, as seen by the dotted portion of figure 2.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg2" position="float" seq="2">

         <p>For example, if a cat’s purr is a sign, the object of that sign is a correspondence‐preserving projection from the set of behaviors (or interpretants) humans may or must perform (within some particular community) in the context of and because of a cat’s purr: pick it up and pet it, stroke it under the chin, exclaim “Oh, that’s so cute!”, offer a sympathetic low guttural, stay seated petting it even when one needs to pee, and so on. Needless to say, humans tend to objectify such objects by glossing them in terms of physiology (say, the “purr‐organ” has been activated), emotion (say, “She must be contented”), or purpose (say, “She wants me to continue petting her”). Similarly, saying that the object of an instrument is a function means that a function is a correspondence‐preserving projection of the ensemble of behaviors (qua interpretants) that one is (normatively) entitled or committed to do while wielding the instrument: appropriate and effective actions that one may use the instrument to undertake.</p>
         <p>In Peircean semiotics, the relation between sign and object is fundamental and is sometimes referred to as the “ground” (Parmentier 1994, 4; Peirce 1955<italic>a</italic>). Famously, in the case of <italic>symbols</italic>, this relation is arbitrary and is usually thought to reside in “convention.” Examples include words like “boy” and “run.” In the case of <italic>indices</italic>, this relation is based in spatiotemporal and/or causal contiguity. Examples include exclamations like “Ouch!” and symptoms like fever. And in the case of <italic>icons</italic>, this relation is based in similarity of qualities (such as shape, size, color, or texture). Examples include portraits and diagrams. The same object may be stood for by a symbol (say, the word “dogs”), an index (say, pointing to a dog), or an icon (say, a picture of a dog). When Saussure speaks of the “arbitrary” and the “motivated” (1983 [1916]), he is really speaking about semiotic processes whose sign‐object relations are relatively symbolic versus relatively iconic‐indexical (table 1).</p>
         <p>While many anthropologists are familiar with Peirce’s distinction between icons, indices, and symbols, most are not familiar with his threefold typology of interpretants. In particular, as inspired by Peirce, there are three basic types of interpretants (1955<italic>c</italic>, 276–77; Kockelman 2005). An <italic>affective interpretant </italic>is a change in one’s bodily state. It can range from an increase in metabolism to a blush, from a feeling of pain to a feeling of being off‐balance, from sweating to an erection. This change in bodily state is itself a sign that is potentially perceptible to the body’s owner or to others who can perceive the owner’s body. And, as signs themselves, these interpretants may lead to subsequent and perhaps more developed interpretants. <italic>Energetic interpretants</italic> involve effort and individual causality; they do not necessarily involve purpose, intention, or planning. For example, flinching at the sound of a gun is an energetic interpretant, as are craning one’s neck to see what made a sound, saluting a superior, wielding an instrument (say, pounding in a nail with a hammer), and heeding an affordance (say, tiptoeing on a creaky floor). And <italic>representational interpretants </italic>are signs with prepositional content, such as an assertion (or explicit speech act more generally). Thus, to describe someone’s movement as “He raised his hand” is to offer an interpretant of such a controlled behavior (qua sign) to the extent that it has a purpose (qua object). And therefore, while such representations are signs (that may be subsequently interpreted), they are also interpretants (of prior signs). Finally, it should be emphasized that the same sign can lead to different kinds of interpretants, sometimes simultaneously and sometimes sequentially. For example, upon being exposed to a violent image, one may blush (affective interpretant), avert one’s gaze (energetic interpretant), or say “That shocks me” (representational interpretant) (table 1).</p>
         <p>Finally, each of these three types of interpretants may be paired with a slightly more abstract double, known as an <italic>ultimate interpretant</italic> (cf. Peirce 1955<italic>c</italic>, 277). In particular, an <italic>ultimate affective interpretant </italic>is not a change in bodily state per se but rather a disposition for one’s bodily state to change. Such an interpretant, then, is not itself a sign but is evinced only in a pattern of behavior (as the exercise of that disposition). Analogously, an <italic>ultimate energetic interpretant </italic>is a disposition to behave in certain ways as evinced in purposeful and nonpurposeful behaviors. And finally, an <italic>ultimate representational interpretant</italic> is the propositional content of a representational interpretant, plus all the propositions that may be inferred from it, when all of these propositions are embodied in a change of habit, as evinced in behavior that conforms to these propositional contents. For example, a <italic>belief</italic> is the quintessential ultimate representational interpretant: in being committed to a proposition (i.e., “holding a belief”), one is also committed to any propositions that may be inferred from it, and one’s commitment to this inferentially articulated set of propositions is evinced in one’s behavior: what one is likely or unlikely to do or say insofar as it confirms or contradicts these propositional contents. These ultimate interpretants are not signs in themselves: while they dispose one toward certain behaviors (affectual, energetic, representational), they are not the behaviors per se but rather dispositions to behave in certain ways. Ultimate interpretants are therefore a very precise way of accounting for a habitus, which, in some sense, is just an ensemble of ultimate interpretants as embodied in an individual and as distributed among members of a community (cf. Bourdieu 1977 [1972]).</p>
         <p>While such a sixfold typology of interpretants may seem complicated at first, it should accord with one’s intuitions. Indeed, most emotions really involve a complicated bundling together of all these types of interpretants (Kockelman 2005, 2006<italic>b</italic>). For example, upon hearing a gunshot (as a sign), one may be suffused with adrenaline (affective interpretant); one may make a frightened face (relatively nonpurposeful energetic interpretant); one may run to see what happened (relatively purposeful energetic interpretant); and one may say “That scared the hell out of me” (representational interpretant). Moreover, one may forever tremble at the sight of the woods (ultimate affective interpretant); one may never go into that part of the woods again (ultimate energetic interpretant); and one may forever believe that the woods are filled with dangerous men (ultimate representational interpretant). In this way, most so‐called emotions may be decomposed into a bouquet of more basic and varied interpretants, and the seemingly most subjective forms of experience may be reframed in terms of their intersubjective effects.</p>
         <p>Putting all the foregoing ideas together, four sets of threefold distinctions may be identified. First, any semiotic process has three components: sign, object, interpretant. There are three kinds of sign‐object relations, or grounds: iconicity (quality), indexicality (contiguity), and symbolism (convention). And there are three kinds of interpretants: affective, energetic, and representational (along with their ultimate variants). Finally, Peirce’s categories of firstness, secondness, and thirdness (1955<italic>b</italic>), while notoriously difficult to define, are best understood as genus categories that include the foregoing categories as species (table 1). In particular, firstness is to secondness is to thirdness as sign is to object is to interpretant, as iconic is to indexical is to symbolic, as affective is to energetic is to representational. In what follows, this threefold relationship will undergird a theory of agency.</p>

               <p>Peirce’s collected writings are not only vast and complicated but also often opaque and contradictory. The following framework, then, while in the spirit of Peirce, is not to the letter. It is meant to be simple without being simplistic. A justification and elaboration of this interpretation of Peirce may be found in Kockelman (2005, 2006<italic>d</italic>), and an extension of this framework to account for economic value may be found in Kockelman (2006<italic>b</italic>). Alternative but compatible approaches to Peirce—at once technical, philosophical, ethnographic, and aesthetic—include Colapietro (1989), Daniels (1984, 1997), and Parmentier (1994).

         <title>Residential Agency</title>
         <p>
            <italic>Residential agency</italic> describes the degree to which one may control the expression of a sign, compose the relation between a sign and an object, and commit to the interpretant of this sign‐object relation.5 To <italic>control </italic>the expression of a sign means to determine its position in space and time. Loosely speaking, one determines where and when a sign is expressed. To <italic>compose </italic>the relation between a sign and an object means to determine what object is stood for by a sign and/or which sign stands for this object. Loosely speaking, one determines what meaning is expressed and/or how this meaning is expressed. And to <italic>commit </italic>to the interpretant of a sign‐object relation means to determine what effect the expression of a sign will have to the extent that it stands for a particular object. It is the degree to which one may anticipate an interpretant, where this anticipation is evinced in being surprised by and/or disposed to sanction unanticipated interpretants.6 Loosely speaking, one determines why and/or to what effect a sign is expressed.</p>
         <p>For example, controlling the expression of a sign may involve determining when and where an utterance is spoken, an instrument is wielded, or an action is undertaken. Composing a sign‐object relation may involve determining which utterance is spoken, which instrument is wielded, or which action is undertaken. And committing to an interpretant of this sign‐object relation may involve determining what effect the utterance will have when and where it is spoken, what result the instrument will have when and where it is wielded, or what the outcome of the action will be when and where it is undertaken. Phrasing all these points about residential agency in an Aristotelian idiom, the committer determines the end, the composer determines the means, and the controller determines when and where the means will be wielded for the end. In this way, one may distinguish between instigator‐based agency (control: when and where), means‐based agency (composition: what and how), and ends‐based agency (commitment: why and to what effect).</p>
         <p>As should now be clear, this theory of residential agency is grounded in Peirce’s theory of semiosis. In particular, there are three dimensions to residential agency for the same reason that there are three components to any semiotic process: control involves signs (firstness), composition involves the relation between signs and objects (secondness), and commitment involves interpretants of sign‐object relations (thirdness). Moreover, Peirce’s theory not only justifies the number of dimensions but also provides a means for determining the relative degree of agency one may have over each of these three dimensions with regard to various kinds of semiotic processes. For example, indexical signs (such as pointing) involve a relationship of spatial‐temporal contiguity with their objects. This means that such signs may be expressed only in the context of such objects, and therefore the signer has relatively less control with indices than with symbols (whose relationship with their objects is based in convention rather than contiguity). In other words, the spatial and temporal location of the objects of indices constrain the where and the when of the expression of the signs that stand for them. Indeed, not only do indices constrain one’s control over the expression of a sign but also they constrain one’s composition of the sign‐object relation. In other words, whereas symbols may be used to indicate objects that exist in or outside of the immediate context, indexical signs may be used only to indicate objects that exist in that context.</p>
         <p>For example, a relatively indexical sign like “Ouch!” must usually be said in contiguity with the pain that causes it, whereas a relatively symbolic sign like “That really hurt” may be used to talk about a painful experience anytime after it occurs (Kockelman 2003). Moreover, because of the complicated grammar and extensive vocabulary that are part and parcel of linguistic symbols, speakers of natural languages have an incredible degree of composition—which is another way of phrasing von Humboldt’s understanding of language as infinite ends (qua utterances) with finite means (qua grammar and vocabulary). For example, whereas there are a finite number of interjections for indicating pain, using the vocabulary and grammar of a language one may describe an infinite variety of different kinds of painful events, which may be more or less displaced from (or noncontiguous with) the event of speaking. In short, symbols usually allow for greater degrees of control and composition than indices.</p>
         <p>Semiotic grounds (iconic, indexical, symbolic) also constrain one’s commitment to the interpretant of one’s sign‐object relation. Mead (1934), for example, makes a famous distinction between the gestural and the symbolic (and see Vygotsky 1978). In particular, he says that “the vocal gesture becomes a significant symbol … when it has the same effect on the individual making it that it has on the individual to whom it is addressed or who explicitly responds to it, and thus involves a reference to the self of the individual making it” (p. 46). Symbols for Mead are inherently self‐reflexive signs: the signer can anticipate another’s interpretant of a sign insofar as the signer can stand in the shoes of the other and thereby expect and/or predict the other’s reaction. In this way, the symbolic for Mead is the realm of behavior in which one can seize control of one’s appearance and thereby act for the sake of others’ interpretants. All such behavior has the possibility of being intentionally communicative, even if only covertly so. For example, in Mead’s terms using a hammer to pound in a nail is gestural, whereas wielding a hammer to (covertly) inform another of one’s purpose (rather than or in addition to driving a nail through a board) is symbolic.7</p>
         <p>Crucially, while Mead’s distinction between the gestural and the symbolic relates to Peirce’s distinction between index and symbol, they should not be confused. Moreover, Mead’s terms should not be confused with the everyday meaning of gesture (say, in comparison with verbal language). Indeed, for Mead, the features of a semiotic process that really contribute to its being a symbol rather than a gesture are whether the ground (or sign‐object relation) is symbolic rather than indexical and whether the sign is symmetrically accessible to the signer’s and the interpreter’s senses. Signs with relatively conventional grounds (in Peirce’s sense) are more likely to be symbols (in Mead’s sense), and signs with relatively indexical grounds (in Peirce’s sense) are more likely to be gestures (in Mead’s sense). And by “symmetric” is meant that the sign appears to the signer and interpreter in ways that are sensibly identical: both perceive (hear, see, smell, touch) the sign in more or less the same way. For example, spoken language is relatively symmetric and a facial expression is relatively asymmetric, with sign language being somewhere in the middle. (Mirrors are one of the means we use to make relatively asymmetric signs symmetric.) In short, taking Mead’s cues, semiotic processes whose signs are relatively symmetric and whose grounds are relatively symbolic are easier to commit to than semiotic processes whose signs are relatively asymmetric and whose grounds are relatively iconic‐indexical. And commitment is crucial because it allows for self‐reflexive semiosis, in which a signer has internalized and therefore can anticipate the interpretants of others. Commitment, then, is fundamental to reflexivity as a defining feature of selfhood.</p>
         <p>As another example of the relative degrees of agency along each of these three dimensions we may turn to Peirce’s typology of interpretants. The interpretant component of a semiotic process is usually the sign component of an incipient semiotic process: interpretants, then, are usually just signs seen from a different semiotic frame. This being the case, we may examine affective, energetic, and representational interpretants—now understood as signs—from the standpoint of residential agency. In particular, relatively speaking, we have more control, composition, and commitment over representational interpretants (as signs, which stand for objects and give rise to further interpretants) than over energetic interpretants; and we have more control, composition, and commitment over energetic interpretants than over affective interpretants. And this should come as no surprise: representational interpretants are relatively symbolic (in Peirce’s and Mead’s sense) and relatively symmetric, whereas affective and energetic interpretants are relatively iconic and indexical (in Peirce’s sense), gestural (in Mead’s sense), and asymmetric. To return to an earlier example, one has less residential agency (relatively speaking) over blushing (affective interpretant) than over averting one’s eyes (energetic interpretant) or saying “That disgusts me” (representational interpretant). And, within the domain of energetic interpretants, one has less residential agency over a reaction or nonpurposeful behavior (pulling one’s hand away from a flame) than over an action or purposeful behavior (raising one’s hand to ask a question).</p>
         <p>More canonical examples of distributed residential agency include theater and performance more generally. Laurence Olivier controls or “performs” the character of Hamlet that William Shakespeare composed or “scripted” and whose interpretant (say, either the audience’s applause or Ophelia’s reaction) both Laurence and William to some shared degree committed to. Indeed, not only may different individuals at different points in space‐time inhabit these roles but different pieces of the same individual may inhabit them. For example, with psycholocation we speak metaphorically of the lips’ controlling what the mind composes and the heart commits to. Reported speech is a classic example of this kind of distributed agency. Following Goffman, I control (or “animate”) what another composed (or “authored”). Or, following Bakhtin, every utterance I make is half my own and half someone else’s. In the case of linguistic utterances, this distribution of control and composition across multiple actors at different points in space‐time is perhaps the best‐theorized mode of residential agency, and much linguistic anthropology in the last decades has focused on related issues under headings such as “authorship,” “creativity,” and “voice” (key works include Goodwin 1990, Hill 1995, and Irvine 1996).</p>
         <p>Also of particular interest to linguistic anthropologists is reference. One can investigate the degree of control and composition one has over the manner in which one refers to some entity with a noun‐phrase (when committing to the addressee’s identification of its referent): “this guy I met,” “Jack,” “the man over there,” “the guy I was telling you about,” “my first husband,” “that cad,” “this man,” “he,” ∅ (a null‐marker), and so on. In particular, the relative symmetry of the speaker’s and addressee’s horizons constrains what can be referred to and how—what the speaker can refer to (and how) as a function of what the addressee can identify (and how easily)—as a function of the way the social relation between the speaker and the addressee is currently construed. The work of Brown and Gilman (1972) on pronouns, that of Goodwin (1979) on collaborative reference, and that of Hanks (1990) on deixis is fundamental here. Much semiotic agency is at least as subtle as this, turning on the relative overlap of participants’ experiential, discursive, and cultural horizons and requiring detailed analysis of real‐time discursive practices. And this example shows that it is not usually a concrete entity—qua participant in an interaction—that determines participants’ control, composition, or commitment but rather the temporally unfolding interaction itself. In other words, the locus of agency may often rest not in the individuals but rather in their ongoing interactions and the institutions that enable these.</p>
         <p>Regarding invention or “authorship,” there is both composition and commitment. In particular, for semiotic and nonsemiotic instruments (e.g., speech acts or tools), composition may be understood as either “choice” (among a range of pregiven instruments: say, using a flat‐head or a Phillips‐head screw) or “invention” (adding to the range of pregiven instruments: say, inventing glue). For example, I can compose an utterance using words and rules that are already given, or, if I am Joyce, I can invent new words (e.g., “quark”) and/or new rules (e.g., the continuous novel). But this is also true for actions: one can “choose” out of an ensemble of known choices (walking through the woods rather than across the park to get home), or one can “invent” a new means (digging a tunnel or teleporting). Similarly, regarding commitment, one can choose from an already given ensemble of ends or one can invent a new end. For example, I can kill someone to maintain my honor, to earn a sum of money, or to extract revenge. Or, I can act for a personal value—say, to create a motiveless crime. Composition and commitment can be distinguished. For example, one may compose a theory or idea but not commit to any particular interpretant or use of it (think of Leo Szilard and fission in relation to the atomic bomb and Hiroshima). When the constituent in question is an identity, choosing versus inventing (versus mere acceptance) is often phrased in terms of authenticity—the degree to which one can compose (be it choose or invent) and commit to one’s identity (and its attendant values) rather than merely be socialized into it (Taylor 1989).</p>
         <p>To borrow an example from political economy (Kockelman 2006<italic>b</italic>), many modern commodities, such as computers, promise greater degrees of agency to their users: by being more and more portable, they allow their users more control; by being more and more personalized, they allow their users more composition; and by being more and more predictable, they allow their users more commitment. This process is now reflexive, such that consumers can now have agency over the production of the commodity in question. For example, one may virtually assemble a car, mixing and matching what kinds of features it could have and even taking the assembled features for a “test‐drive” to find out what kinds of performance it will offer. And all of this can be done, with an Internet connection, from the comfort of one’s home and prior to the actual purchase or production of the commodity in question.</p>
         <p>Finally, the foregoing has emphasized the semiotic constraints on residential agency (that is, how properties of semiotic processes enable and constrain signers’ residential agency over them). However, social constraints are just as important and, indeed, part and parcel of semiotic constraints. In particular, one cannot say just anything at any given place or time and expect it to have some particular effect. Rather, as a function of the social relation in which one is implicated, different kinds of semiotic processes are more or less permitted and more or less obligatory. In the case of explicit performative utterances, this is self‐evident: not just anyone may say, “You’re under arrest” or “I pronounce you husband and wife.” And even those people who may make such utterances may not usually make them at any time or in any place. Rather, the rights and responsibilities that make up a social status (such as priest, sheriff, mother, doctor) may often be described in terms of semiotic rights and responsibilities: what kinds of actions and utterances one may or must make as a function of the social context one is in. In this way, a key constraint on our residential agency is the kinds of social statuses we relationally inhabit to the extent that these social statuses enable and constrain semiotic processes as to their when and where (control), their what and how (composition), and their why and to what effect (commitment). In a more formal register, much of what the “law” does is regiment what kinds of actions can be performed or utterances can be made when and where, by whom, and to what effect. In other words, the law regiments the residential agency of those who inhabit different kinds of statuses in a way that is relatively unique in being explicit (laws, in contrast to norms, are articulated in language) and political (laws, in contrast to rules, are promulgated and enforced by a state).</p>
         <p>Another key aspect of the social mediation of residential agency is common in social theory: the conditions and consequences of internalizing the “gaze” of another. In particular, Bentham’s panopticon, Freud’s superego, and Nietzsche’s conscience all involve the human‐specific ability to regiment one’s own behavior as if one were being regimented by someone else (see Foucault 1978, 1995). In a Meadian idiom, all involve symbolic behavior rather than gestural behavior. And in the idiom of semiotic agency, all involve commitment: the ability to anticipate another’s interpretant (of one’s actions and utterances) and thereby come to act and utter for the sake of these interpretants—or, perhaps more often, for the sake of <italic>staving off</italic> such interpretants. In this way, we all come to act as if we were being watched—as if every move of the self were a sign subject to the interpretation of others. Thus, the panopticon—situated between physical architecture and social institution—is a condition of possibility for prisoners to commit to the interpretants of the semiotic processes in which they are implicated. Here, then, one could offer a history of architectural designs and institutional relationships—from the localized and physical to the networked and digital—that enable or constrain the commitment (control and composition) of those whose semiotic processes are implicated in them.</p>

               <p>Readers familiar with Goffman should hear echoes of his decomposition of the speaker into participant roles. In particular, in his article “Footing” (1981; and see Kockelman 2004), Goffman decomposed the notion of “speaker” into a number of more basic roles: animator, author, and principal (p. 120). The <italic>animator</italic> is “a body engaged in acoustic activity” (p. 144), the one who physically produces the utterance in question. The <italic>author</italic> is “someone who has selected the sentiments that are being expressed and the words in which they are encoded,” and the <italic>principal</italic> is “someone whose position is established by the words that are spoken, someone whose beliefs have been told, someone who is committed to what the words say.” In short, the animator says the words, the author composes the words said, and the principal shoulders responsibility for what the words say. As Goffman noted, the same individual does not necessarily inhabit all these participant roles at once. For example, in reported speech authors and principals are disambiguated from animators, and in presidential addresses principals and animators are disambiguated from authors (pp. 145–46). Thus, only when a single individual inhabits all three of Goffman’s roles do we have a prototypical speaker.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the family resemblance between them, participant roles and residential agency should not be confused. First, Goffman’s system of participant roles was designed for linguistic signs; residential agency works for any semiotic process. Second, Goffman cannot account for why his system has three terms and not two or four, one or eight. In contrast, residential agency is phrased in terms of thirdness: control the expression of a sign, compose a sign‐object relation, and commit to an interpretant of this relation. In this way, it provides a reason for the logic of its own system (in terms of a particular theory of meaning), and it provides much more precise definitions of its various dimensions. Thus, there are three dimensions to residential agency for the same reason that there are three components of any semiotic process, three types of sign‐object relations, and so forth.</p>
               <p>Third, Goffman has nothing like representational agency to go hand in hand with residential agency, and, in general, he is not theorizing agency as a larger category of social theory but theorizing particular features of interaction that occur in linguistic communication. In this sense, his theory is much narrower in scope.</p>
               <p>Fourth, while Goffman takes up incumbency (the idea that different individuals can inhabit different participant roles or that different entities can be involved in different dimensions of agency), he never takes up the crucial question of <italic>degree</italic>: that there are different degrees of control, composition, and commitment as a function of the semiotic or social process at issue. Rather, he takes the inhabitation of participant roles to be an all‐or‐nothing affair: one is an author or animator or not; one is never more or less of an author or animator. This is probably because he understands his categories as roles (animator, author, principal) and not as both roles and relations (controller and control, composer and composition, committer and commitment). Thus, an animator for Goffman is just the acoustic box (a “speaker” in Sony’s sense of the term), whereas a controller is that which determines the time and place of the expression of a sign, and control is a way of gauging the degree to which the controller determines this (which itself depends on semiotic and social factors, as just discussed).</p>
               <p>Fifth, and perhaps most important, while there is a close parallel between animator and controller, on the one hand, and author and composer, on the other, the potential parallel between principal and committer is a false one. In particular, Goffman’s notion of principal is really a way of describing who bears responsibility for the repercussions of some utterance (the principal is the one who believes what is said or intends to do what is promised), and therefore the principal is really the one who can be held accountable for the utterance. In contrast, commitment is grounded in Mead and Vygotsky’s notion of internalization: the degree to which one anticipates an interpretant, where this anticipation is evinced in being surprised by and/or disposed to sanction un‐anticipated interpretants.</p>
               <p>Indeed, it may be argued that Goffman is working with a Saussurian theory of meaning, grounded in a two‐term distinction (signifier and signified), which thereby provides two roles: animator (the one who utters the signifier) and author (the one who chooses which signifier to utter and thereby what meaning is signified). His principal is really not of the same order as these other two terms but a second‐order interpretation of the relative responsibility of the speaker for what he or she says. In other words, in bringing together animator, author, and principal as three species of a common genus, Goffman conflates two different orders of analysis: analytic categories of agency and local theories of how implication in these categories relates to the agent’s degree of accountability.</p>
               <p>In contrast, the correct move is to have three first‐order pieces (control, composition, and commitment), themselves grounded in a Peircean theory of semiosis (sign, object, interpretant) rather than a Saussurean theory of semiology (signifier, signified), and then add to them a second‐order piece: local understandings, within some semiotic community, of how one’s accountability for the outcome of some semiotic process (see below) turns on one’s degree of control, composition, and commitment over the various components of that semiotic process.</p>

               <p>Commitment is not the same as address. In particular, an <italic>addressed </italic>semiotic process is one whose interpretant a signer commits to and one whose sign is expressed for the purpose of that interpretant. In this way, address presupposes commitment but not vice versa. Address may be <italic>overt </italic>or <italic>covert </italic>depending on whether the interpreter is meant to (or may easily) infer the signer’s commitment and purpose.</p>

               <p>Indeed, it involves commitment (being able to anticipate the interpretant of another), address (purposely expressing a sign—in this case a controlled behavior—for the sake of another’s interpretant), and covert address (in which the other is not supposed to recognize one’s purpose and commitment).</p>

         <title>Representational Agency</title>
         <p>We have seen that a representation is any sign or interpretant that has a proposition for its object. While the focus so far has been on representational interpretants (for example, saying “That shocks me” upon seeing a violent image), representational signs are much more famous—as evinced in any declarative utterance: “John raised his hand,” “The dog vomited on the floor,” “My nephew has a fever,” “Electrons are charged particles,” and so forth. Indeed, such utterances are often simultaneously representational signs and interpretants. For example, the utterance “John raised his hand” is at once an interpretant of John’s action (as a semiotic process whose sign is a controlled behavior and whose object is a purpose) and a sign that may be subsequently interpreted. What is crucial about representations is that they have propositions as their objects: this means that they may be true or false and be implicated in logical relations such as induction and deduction. Not only may propositions represent the world correctly or incorrectly but also they may stand as the premises and conclusions of inferences. While most semiotic processes (such as facial expressions, instruments, and joint attention) do not have propositional contents, those that do are implicated in another mode of flexibility that may be called “representational agency.”</p>
         <p>In particular, <italic>representational agency </italic>describes the degree to which one may thematize a process, characterize a feature of this theme, and reason with this theme‐character relation. To <italic>thematize</italic> a process means to determine what the theme or topic of a propositional sign will be. Loosely speaking, one determines what the proposition is “about.” In the case of linguistic signs, this is typically called the “topic” (from an informational standpoint) and “reference” (from a functional standpoint). For example,8 the themes of the foregoing utterances were “John,” “the dog,” “my nephew,” and “electrons.” To <italic>characterize</italic> a feature of a thematized process means to determine what properties are attributed to this theme. In the case of linguistic signs, this is typically called the “focus” (from an informational standpoint) and “predication” (from a functional standpoint). For example, the characters of the foregoing utterances were “raised his hand,” “vomited on the floor,” “has a fever,” and “are charged particles.” The propositional content of a representation, then, brings together a theme and character. If a theme is what one is talking about, a character is what one is saying regarding what one is talking about.9</p>
         <p>If the dimensions of thematization and characterization determine the informational content of a proposition, the dimension of reason determines its epistemological status. In particular, what is crucial about representations is the ways in which they are caught up in knowledge. “Knowledge,” needless to say, is a tricky term. In a tradition that extends back to Plato, it will here be treated as <italic>justified true representation </italic>(cf. Brandom 1994, 202; Kockelman 2006<italic>c</italic>). The term “representation” has just been defined as a sign or interpretant with propositional content, as exemplified by everyday assertions, and “justified” means that the maker of such an assertion (or the holder of such a belief) can provide a reason for that representation if called upon by other members of some community. Justification, then, fundamentally turns on the epistemological norms of a community, and different communities have different understandings of what counts as a good reason for one’s representations. Often, what is involved is a particular kind of source event upon which the representation is based (Kockelman 2004). For example, how do I know that the dog vomited on the floor? My sister told me (and she is known to be of sound mind, sharp eyes, and good character). How do I know it will rain? I see dark clouds on the horizon (and this provides a compelling reason for such an inference in this climate given my past experience). Such source events may turn on various kinds of perception (seeing, hearing, tasting, touching), modes of report (firsthand, secondhand, thirdhand, gossip, myth), and modes of inference (deductive or inductive, sound or valid). This means that representations are not just inferentially articulated but also indexically grounded. They are caught up in both logical and causal relations.</p>
         <p>The term “true” is slightly trickier only because there are so many folk understandings of what it should be. Usually it is taken to be something like correspondence between one’s assertion and the state of affairs. As used here, however, it refers to the unchallengeability of one’s assertion in the context of one’s addressees (see Kockelman 2004). In particular, for a speaker’s representation to be “true” means that others subsequently use this representation as a reason for further representations. In this way, it licenses them to make further claims that take one’s initial representation for granted as an assumption; moreover, if called upon to justify these further claims, they may refer back to one’s initial representation as a reason (Brandom 1994; Kockelman 2006<italic>c</italic>). Thus, my representation that the dog vomited on the floor is “true” to the extent that your reaction is to ask what I cleaned it up with or to demand to know what I’ve been feeding the dog or to report the dog’s having vomited to a friend over the phone, and so forth. In this way, truth is not (primarily) a question of correspondence between an assertion and the state of affairs but rather a question of the social relation between a speaker and an addressee—in particular, the ways in which the addressee—or addressees, however distal, sundry, or unsuspecting—takes up one’s claim and thereby presumes it in subsequent actions. (Needless to say, the latter can be a function of the former, and in the case of scientific epistemic communities, we hope that it is, so this definition is in no way meant to eschew various forms of realism, as should be apparent from the indexical grounding of justification.)</p>
         <p>Finally, in cases of self‐reflexive semiosis (such as talking to oneself and thinking), mathematical demonstrations, legal arguments, political debates, and so forth, the dimension of reason may involve the most stereotypic and celebrated of logical processes: the degree to which one may use one’s current representation to infer a new representation and/or the degree to which one has used an old representation to infer one’s current representation. Here, then, reasoning is directly tied to inference—the logical (cognitive and semiotic) resources we have for moving from premises to conclusions: deduction, induction, abduction. Examples range from the <italic>Gedanken</italic> experiments of theoretical physicists to the confidence intervals of experimental psychologists, from Bayesian learning to Popper’s deductivism, from Venn diagrams to Aristotelian syllogisms. Representational agency, then, turns as much on how we argue as on what we argue about.</p>
         <p>In short, and loosely speaking, one may distinguish between theme‐based representational agency (what we are talking about), character‐based representational agency (what we are saying about what we are talking about), and reason‐based representational agency (what are we concluding from, or what we have used to conclude, what we are saying about what we are talking about). To have representational agency is to be able to refer, predicate, and infer—or, if one wants to open up the analysis to include “thinking” (and the internal representations of cognitive scientists), what we are representing, how we are representing what we are representing, and what other representations were used to infer this representation (or were inferred from this representation).</p>
         <p>The ways in which our most quotidian representations are caught up in information (theme and character) and knowledge (justified and true information) may be called <italic>the epistemology of the everyday</italic>. Very similar processes on much more elaborated scales provide the foundations for modern scientific research as well. Indeed, an episteme—in Foucault’s (1978) sense—may be couched in terms of the dimensions of representational agency: different research traditions have different objects of study (thematization), different questions they pose about these objects (characterization), and different criteria for deciding whether their answers to these questions are justified and true (reasoning).10</p>
         <p>Just as the interpretant of one semiotic process may be the sign of an incipient semiotic process and just as the character of one representation (qua focus) may be the theme of a subsequent representation (qua topic), so too may the truth of one representation be the justification for a subsequent representation. In other words, in the tradition of Hilary Putnam (1975), there is a division of residential and representational agency, as distributed across long chains of temporally, spatially, and socially distal actors and institutions.</p>
         <p>To take the simplest example of representational agency of direct relevance to linguistic anthropologists, there is <italic>metalanguage </italic>in the strict sense, as evinced in practices such as translation and glossing. Here, one thematizes a sound, word, or utterance (treating it as a sign in need of translation), one characterizes the meaning of that sign (usually in terms of other simpler or more familiar signs), and one offers a reason for one’s translation (via philology, a dictionary, regional expertise, two years of ethnographic fieldwork, and so forth). Consider (a piece of) Jakobson’s (1990) famous example: “Flicks means movies.” Here the sign “flicks” has been thematized, and the object of this sign has been characterized (“means movies”). Moreover, the speaker may be called on to justify this assertion (explaining, say, that she watched a lot of American movies in the ’60s), and the addressee may go on to presuppose this assertion, thereby treating it as true (for example, using this word to establish reference in a subsequent speech event). Needless to say, the words in question may be much more loaded than “flicks”: “terrorist,” “carcinogen,” “life,” “pornography,” “art,” “agency.” In this way, metalanguage, as one of the most obvious modes of representational agency, is manifestly political—especially when attention is shifted from its reflexive character (long of interest to linguistic anthropologists) to its propositional content (as theme and character) and epistemological status (as justified and true), and such ideas may be generalized from how we gloss words to how we interpret actions to how we ascribe mental states.</p>
         <p>Also of direct interest to linguistic anthropologists is <italic>stance‐taking</italic> (Kockelman 2004 and references therein, and see Hill and Irvine 1992). This turns on indicating how strongly one is committed to the truth of a representation (via grammatical categories such as status and complement‐taking predicates such as “believe” and “doubt”) and what source events one is using to justify one’s representation (as evinced in grammatical categories such as evidentiality and complement‐taking predicates such as “see” and “hear”). To continue with the example just given, we may use linguistic categories to indicate our stance toward a translation, and toward any representation more generally: “I suspect that `flicks' means `movies'”; “`Flicks' must mean `movies'”; “I was told that `flicks' means `movies'”; “I believe that electrons are charged particles”; “It smells like the dog vomited on the floor”; “The weatherman says it is going to rain”; and so forth. Such grammatical and lexical categories (“believe,” “suspect,” “must,” “smells like,” and so forth) are some of the key semiotic resources we have for fine‐tuning (mitigating, clarifying, hedging, announcing) the responsibility‐taking and right‐granting that is part and parcel of knowledge practices to the extent that they turn on the justification for and truthfulness of representations.</p>
         <p>As with residential agency, we may theorize various semiotic and social constraints on representational agency. Indeed, with regard to <italic>linguistic epistemes</italic>, there is a long tradition of theories in linguistic anthropology which try to account for the psychological salience of various linguistic forms (both to speakers of a language and to linguists studying languages) and thus the relationship between linguistic structure and linguistic ideology (Hill 1996; Hill and Mannheim 1992; Irvine 1989; Irvine and Gal 2000; Lucy 1992, 1993; Schieffelin, Woolard, and Kroskrity 1998; Silverstein 1981; Whorf 1956<italic>a</italic> [1937]). For example, Boas (1989 [1910], 249) suggested that linguistic and ethnologic phenomena are differentially accessible to consciousness and hence differentially amenable to knowledge:<disp-quote>
               <p>It is a characteristic of linguistic classifications that they never rise into consciousness, while other classifications, although the same unconscious origin prevails, often do rise into consciousness. It seems very plausible, for instance, that the fundamental religious notions, like the idea of will power immanent in inanimate objects, or the anthropomorphic character of animals, are in their origin just as little conscious as the fundamental ideas of language. While, however, the use of language is so automatic that the opportunity never arises for the fundamental notions to emerge into consciousness, this happens very frequently in all phenomena relating to religion.</p>
            </disp-quote>Interpreting Boas in the terms introduced here and making no distinction between ideology and knowledge, we might say that he argued that because linguistic forms (such as tense and gender) are more tacit, habitual, and obligatory than religious or cultural beliefs (regarding, say, cosmic phenomena as expressed in assertions), they are less likely to “rise into consciousness” and hence less likely to be subject to explanations (p. 250). Extending his claims, we may say that grammatical categories are not likely to be foregrounded (thematized), commented upon (characterized), or rationalized (reasoned with) by speakers. To some degree, to the extent that beliefs are often articulated through assertions, this may be understood as the claim that we have more representational agency over the contents of expression than over the means of expression—over what we say than over how we say it. Indeed, it might be phrased as follows: <italic>Any system through which we articulate experience is not itself experienced in a way that is easy to articulate</italic>. We often have very little representational agency over our systems of representation.</p>
         <p>Saussure (1983 [1916], 81) characterized a kind of <italic>diachronic unconscious:</italic> 
            <disp-quote>
               <p>The first thing which strikes one on studying linguistic facts is that the language user is unaware of their succession in time: he is dealing with a state. Hence the linguist who wishes to understand this state must rule out of consideration everything which brought that state about, and pay no attention to diachrony. Only by suppressing the past can he enter into the state of mind of the language user.</p>
            </disp-quote>Indeed, one might generalize this relative awareness of synchronic relations (versus diachronic ones) to the relative awareness of syntagmatic, or combining, relations (versus paradigmatic, or selecting, relations), the relative awareness of <italic>parole</italic>, or linguistic utterances (versus <italic>langue</italic>, or language structure), the relative awareness of value <italic>as essence</italic> (versus value <italic>through difference</italic>), and the relative awareness of <italic>signifieds</italic>, or features of objects (versus <italic>signifiers</italic>, or features of signs). In short, as phrased in terms of Saussure’s famous categories, speakers’ ability to “become conscious of” (or thematize, characterize, and reason with) manifestly linguistic semiotic processes is differentially mediated as a function of whether the semiotic process in question (or any of its components) is synchronic or diachronic, syntagmatic or paradigmatic, <italic>parole</italic>‐based or <italic>langue</italic>‐based, signified or signifier, understood as essence or understood through difference.</p>
         <p>Sapir (1985 [1927], 548) offered two key moves that parallel the foregoing interpretation of Saussure. First, he thought it was easier to thematize and characterize a single constituent or a single sign event than to articulate its relation to other constituents or to the semiotic system per se. This might be called a <italic>systemic unconscious</italic>:<disp-quote>
               <p>It is a matter of common knowledge that it is relatively easy to fix the attention on some arbitrarily selected element of experience, such as a sensation or an emotion, but that it is far from easy to become conscious of the exact place which such an element holds within a constellation of behavior. It is easy for an Australian native, for instance, to say by what kinship term he calls so and so or whether or not he may undertake such and such relations with a given individual. It is exceedingly difficult for him to give a general rule of which these specific examples of behavior are but illustrations, though all the while he acts as though the rule were perfectly well known to him.</p>
            </disp-quote>Sapir also theorized that grammatical categories of the kind Boas took to be relatively unconscious are likely to be unconsciously projected onto a speaker’s conception of the world: “One is always unconsciously finding what one is in unconscious subjection to” (1985 [1927], 549; and see Whorf 1956<italic>b</italic> [1939]). In short, speakers’ representational agency over a given domain of experience (what they notice, what they say about what they notice, and what they infer from what they say about what they notice) is influenced by the way the experience is encoded in their linguistic categories. In other words, grammatical categories are taken to be ontological ones. We may generalize this point: <italic>Properties of signs of objects are taken to be properties of objects of signs</italic>.11 In sum, Sapir argued that individual elements of systems were more subject to representational agency than systems of interrelated elements and that features of the system through which we articulate our experiences of the world are often taken to be features of the world we articulate—and thus confound our attempts to have representational agency over them.</p>
         <p>The foregoing points have characterized the ways in which speakers’ representational agency over the systems with which they speak is mediated by properties of linguistic systems themselves. However, the general logic of these arguments may be extended to account for the limits of representational agency over any other system in which humans are implicated: economic processes, kinship structures, gender relations, institutional hierarchies, political systems, psychological processes, physical domains, mathematical symbols, computer languages, and so forth. Each of these systems has physical, social, and semiotic properties which both constrain and enable our ability to thematize their constituent elements, characterize properties of these themes, and reason with these theme‐character relations. Classic ideas such as Freud’s understanding of the unconscious and Marx’s understanding of coming to consciousness may be fruitfully related to these ideas.</p>

               <p>Strictly speaking, one has representational agency over that which is being represented (e.g., some person, instrument, action, thing, or event), not over that which is being used to represent it—over which one, rather, has residential agency. In other words, representational agency involves using signs with propositional content to represent some state of affairs: it is the state of affairs over which one has representational agency.</p>

               <p>As linguists know, the status of topics and foci can be quite complicated in real‐time interaction. For the purposes of the present argument, the emphasis is on topic‐comment structure. Readers interested in seeing how these ideas relate to a more sophisticated discursive‐linguistic framework are urged to read Chafe (1998), Lambrecht (1994), and Van Valin and LaPolla (1997 chap. 5). Finally, one should consult Peirce’s related distinctions between rhematic signs, dicent signs, and argument signs (1955<italic>a</italic>, 103–4).</p>

               <label>10</label>
               <p>Several examples may further illuminate the distinction between residential and representational agency. To have representational agency over some state of affairs is to be able to offer a representation of it. For this reason, representational agency always involves residential agency: having representational agency over that which is represented involves having residential agency over that which represents it. For example, when one says “The hammer is heavy,” that over which one has representational agency is the hammer (as an instrument and hence a semiotic process without propositional content): it has been thematized and characterized, and this theme‐character relation can even be reasoned with: “I know because I weighed it” (offer a reason for it) or “So go get a lighter one” (use it as a reason). In contrast, the utterance “The hammer is heavy,” which is a representation of the hammer and its properties (and hence is itself a semiotic process with propositional content), is subject to residential agency: it was controlled, composed, and committed to. One can also have residential agency over a hammer without representational agency: to be able to control one’s wielding of it (determine when and where one picks it up), compose one’s wielding of it (picking it up rather than a sledgehammer), and commit to the effect of one’s wielding it (being surprised if the nail does not go in when hit).</p>

         <title>Agency and Accountability</title>
         <p>The foregoing sections have focused on the relative flexibility of various modes of knowledge and power and the distribution of these modes across material, social, and semiotic processes. The task for this section is to sketch the relation between flexibility and accountability. In particular, and generally speaking, the greater one’s degree of control, composition, and commitment and the greater one’s degree of thematization, characterization, and reasoning, the more responsibility and/or rights one is accorded for the result of some action or utterance. And the more responsibility or rights one is accorded for one’s utterance or action, the more one can be praised or blamed for it, the more one can feel pride or shame for it, and the more one can be rewarded or punished for it. In short, agency tends to scale with accountability.</p>
         <p>For example, much of modern Western morality (say, American and European legal and lay culture) evaluates agency by criteria that may be rendered in terms of these dimensions. In particular, the prototypic “residential agent” is usually a single human individual who inhabits all three roles at once: controller, composer, and committer. And the prototypic representational agent is usually a single human individual who inhabits all three roles at once: thematizer, characterizer, and reasoner. Depending on the semiotic process in question, we call these prototypic agents “actors,” “speakers,” and “thinkers” (even if it means, as it usually does, that we radically decontextualize the ways in which any individual act is enabled and constrained by a manifold of multiple and distal, contingent and contestable acts). Moreover, we tend to categorize and hierarchize entities as a function of the degree of agency we take them to have: human primates versus nonhuman primates, adults versus children, animals versus plants, and so forth. And we positively valorize higher degrees of agency than lower degrees of agency and hence more agentive beings over less agentive beings. For example, we may take them to be more worthy of our respect. Indeed, it is precisely agency’s relation to responsibility and rights, ontology and evaluation, selfhood and statehood, which makes Western scholars interested in it in the first place.</p>
         <p>However, while accountability may tend to scale with these dimensions, it need not. Indeed, one should inquire into local understandings of the various factors summarized earlier: dimensions, degrees, division, and distribution. Various communities will differentially weight such factors when assessing the accountability of some entity for the outcome of some semiotic process in which the entity is implicated: whether it can be praised or blamed, rewarded or punished, subject to pride or shame. In Western legal institutions, for example, responsibility for some action and/or rights over the product realized by some action usually turn on having a “choice” with regard to undertaking that action. Here, then, is where local theories of “agency” intersect with the foregoing theory of agency, and it is one of the reasons the assessment of agency is so important to academics. In this way, and quite importantly, one must take into account not only the semiotic and social theory of agency offered here (delimiting the relevant dimensions of any sign system) but also local understandings of the relation between agency and accountability: the local theories (however tacit) and practices (however subtle) by which a community assesses the relative agency of its members to the extent that they are to be held accountable. Here is where local legal institutions, pecuniary measures, parenting techniques, metaphysical theories, ethnopsychologies, and so forth, will come to the fore.</p>
         <p>For examples of some relatively subtle ways in which this is done, we may turn to Ahearn (2000, 2001<italic>a</italic>, 2001<italic>b</italic>), Duranti (1994, 2004), and Talmy (2000), who have theorized how our descriptions of our own and others’ behavior—that is, our representational interpretants of our own and others’ actions—turn on grammatical and lexical categories which encode semantic features related to animacy, causality, control, and volition. That is, the linguistic resources we use to represent the behavior of others—be it in political speeches, marriage narratives, or love letters—always already construe that behavior in agentive terms (broadly defined). Saying “I broke the vase” versus “The vase broke” versus “The vase broke on me” construes the speaker’s (and hence the actor’s) agency over the event in different ways and may thereby license others to attribute different degrees of accountability—as evinced in, say, whether or not they require one to replace the broken vase. In short, as these scholars have shown, through the attribution of accountability enabled by the construal of agency, the most subtle of grammatical and literary processes may have the starkest of affective and political repercussions (Kockelman [2002] undertakes an Ahearn‐ and Duranti‐inspired approach). The work of these scholars thereby complements the approach outlined here.</p>
         <p>Indeed, even in Western legal and lay culture an actor’s accountability need not scale with all these dimensions equally but may be decided on the basis of one or two of them. For example, when we speak of the “hangman’s guilt,” we are describing the fact that an individual may take responsibility and therefore feel guilty (though not necessarily be punished) for an action in which the individual was only the controller (merely “pushing the button”) and not even accorded much control (say, the time and place were fixed by the state). Or, for readers familiar with the Winchester Mystery House, a roadside attraction near San Jose, California, there is Mrs. Winchester’s guilt because her husband invented guns that were used to kill others (embodied in the mysterious architectural ambiguities of her house, which were designed to ward off ghosts of people slain by those guns). In this case, it was her husband who composed the means (not herself) and neither she nor her husband who controlled their wielding or committed to their ends. There is killing the messenger: while we acknowledge its senselessness, we also note its frequent occurrence. And there is Oedipus: while his sleeping with his mother and his killing of his father were unintentional (or uncommitted to, under that interpretation, though controlled and composed), he felt guilty enough to blind himself for those actions. And there are the various key events from the <italic>Iliad</italic>: a hero on the battlefield is considered praiseworthy because of some great achievement (say, vanquishing a foe) even though this achievement was due to the fact that a god had possessed him and acted through him for the god’s own purpose (cf. Taylor 1989 on afflatus). To reiterate: one must distinguish between the analytic categories offered here (the dimensions, degrees, division, and distribution of agency) and local understandings of accountability as a function of one’s relative agency (often couched in terms such as “choice,” “intention,” “premeditation,” “free will,” and “self‐consciousness”).</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Agency has been theorized in terms of flexibility and accountability, on the one hand, and knowledge and power, on the other. This theory has tried to illuminate agency from a number of perspectives, allowing one to study the distribution of agency in and across real‐time social, semiotic, and material processes. In particular, the foregoing definitions allow one to investigate various <italic>dimensions</italic> of agency—control, composition, commitment; thematization, characterization, and reason—without squashing them together as a single, unspecified quality. Along any one of these dimensions, they allow one to determine constraints on and conditions for various <italic>degrees </italic>of agency and to calibrate and compare these degrees with some precision. They allow one to investigate the <italic>division </italic>of incumbency across these dimensions: who or what is the controller, composer, and committer; who or what is the thematizer, characterizer, and reasoner. And they allow one to investigate the <italic>distribution </italic>of this incumbency across time (now and then), space (here and there), entity (human or nonhuman), unit (superindividual or subindividual), individual (Jack or Jill), and number (single individual or several individuals). In short, while the stakes of agency—as outlined in the classical, modern, and Baconian traditions—remain the same, agency itself has been retheorized in a way that strives to be analytically precise, empirically tractable, and metaphysically satisfying.</p>
