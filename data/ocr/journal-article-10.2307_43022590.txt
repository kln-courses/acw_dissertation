And they are dangerous. - Thomas King (Cherokee), The Truth about Stories Although at first glance, the books under review may seem to lack con- tinuity, from an indigenous perspective that does not separate knowledge into disciplines, these titles are quite complementary and have much to offer those who write, teach, and critique the West and its literatures. American Indian Literary Nationalism and Muting White Noise build the- ory with an insistence on theory's implications for the real world while the two works of social history document themes central to the argu- ment for Indian literary nationalism, such as erasure, absence, agency, transformation, and the power of story as the site of resistance. Stories are powerful, as Cherokee writer Thomas King says in The Truth about Stories: A Native Narrative (2005); they have the power to destroy life and to give it, as these four works illustrate. Acoma poet and scholar Simon Ortiz asserts that story is the only way that event and experience can become significant in the peoples' own terms. American Indian Literary Nationalism begins with a foreword by poet/essayist Simon Ortiz, followed by a preface written by the three authors, then a chapter each by scholar/critic Jace Weaver (Cherokee), scholar/novelist Craig Womack (Creek), and scholar Robert Warrior (Osage). Abenaki scholar Lisa Brooks writes an afterword, and Ortiz's highly influential 1981 M ELUS essay "Towards a National Indian Literature: Cultural Authenticity in Nationalism" provides the volume with its appendix. The book has several aims. First, it commemorates Ortiz's above-cited essay in which he contends that over hundreds of years of European- imposed languages and traditions have been made Indian through the creative process; that Native people have responded creatively to forced colonization and that "this response has been one of resistance. . . . [I]t Western American Literature 42.4 (Winter 2008): 427-35.</page><page sequence="3">428 Western American Literature Winter 2008 is this literature based upon continuing resistance, which has given a particularly nationalistic character to the Native American voice" (257). Ortiz's essay is the touchstone for the second aim of the volume: Weaver, Womack, and Warrior's theories on a Native literary national- ism that they explore and explain in their respective chapters. Brooks then describes her own sense of the meaning and value of Native liter- ary nationalism. Finally, a third aim of the book, especially for Weaver and Womack, is to respond to Elvira Pulitano's 2003 book Toward a Native American Critical Theory y in which she dismisses and actually misreads the work of Weaver, Womack, and Warrior as inferior, inadequate, and "wrong" for their failure to embrace "hybridity" as the main reality of contemporary Native writers' identities and literary works. Pulitano lauds Greg Sarris, Louis Owens, and especially Gerald Vizenor as exemplars of the kind of cosmopolitan, postmodern, hybrid work that marks what she considers the best contemporary Native literature (see her book as well as six reviews of it in American Indian Quarterly [Spring 2005]). We understand the necessity and responsibility the authors have in responding to Pulitano; for in a highly colonizing manner, a non-Native (actually European) critic with the authority of the academy behind her is telling Natives and non- Natives alike what makes an "Indian" as well as "good" Indian literature. That Pulitano admits to not actually knowing Indian people other than through texts is astonishing. Though the authors of this essay review are also non-Native teachers and critics of Native literature, we have difficulty imagining teaching Native American studies without the personal rela- tionships we have established with Native people, including tribal elders, young natural resources managers, artists, storytellers, and writers who visit our classrooms, or without lending a hand to tribal communities on campus and in our region when asked. Quite powerfully and effectively, Weaver and Womack especially, use their response to Pulitano to explain the importance of American Indian nationalism. The authors make clear they are not advocating that Native American literary scholarship be conducted only by Native people, but that Native epistemologies and sources should be privileged (a belief espoused by James Cox and many other non-Native critics of Native literature) and that Native criticism should further the sovereignty and self-determination of Native communities, a widely recognized goal of Native American studies. In his chapter, Weaver writes that the pres- sure for critics of Native literatures to utilize European or cosmopolitan theories is intense: "We are being pushed into a postmodern boarding school, where instead of Christian conversion and vocational skills,</page><page sequence="4">JOHNSON AND JOHNSON 429 assimilation requires that we all embrace our hybridity and mixed-blood identities, and high theory replaces English as the language that must be spoken" (30). Weaver discusses the "two prongs" of American Indian literary nationalism: first, "the consideration of Native American lit- erary output as separate and distinct from other national literatures"; and second, "a criticism of that literature that supports not only its distinct identity but also sees itself as attempting to serve the interest of indigenes and their communities, in particular the support of Native nations and their own separate sovereignties" (15). While responding to Pulitano's claims about his book on Creek literary traditions, Red on Red (1999), Womack discusses the theme of transformation. He posits that it is quite possible that Native peoples and their traditions have influenced Europeans - and even the novel - as much as Europeans have influenced Native Americans, and he asserts forcefully that English is an American Indian language that Native people have been using for hundreds of years (119-20). In a discussion of early twentieth-century Creek writer Alexander Posey, Womack asserts that "transformation may more accurately describe the way Indian people adopt and adapt literary forms than hybridity" (160). Womack is witty in his defense of the study of tribally specific literatures, and at his best when at the end of the chapter he names ten "flexible tenets for a compassionate American Indian literary nationalism" (168). These tenets suggest the importance of careful historicizing, acknowledging the relationship between literatures and the lived realities of Indian com- munities and advocating for Native communities while not uncritically submitting to tribes (168-74). In this chapter, Warrior is highly inspired and influenced by his teacher Edward Said and Said's conception of an "enlightened nation- alism" (181). Above all, Warrior emphasizes the importance of dissent among Native intellectuals in trying to address Native problems and in the theorizing of Native literary nationalism: "My understanding of what it has meant to be Osage now and in history does not involve walking lockstep with others or their ideas. . . . The criticism for which I am advocating here is deeply marked by the conditions of modernity, but that does not mean that criticism came to native people only with the arrival of the modern in the form of colonialism. Various forms of deliberation, critical judgment, dissent, and intellectual independence have existed among Native people, I believe, for eons" (207). Finally, Brooks, in "At the Gathering Place," eloquently defines American Indian literary nationalism. Native nations and a Native intellectual tradition exist as long as tribal people are gathering together</page><page sequence="5">430 Western American Literature Winter 2008 in dialogue. She argues that tribally specific criticism, such as Womack's and her own work on Abenaki literary traditions, enriches the field and encourages Native students to join the conversation. Perhaps most impor- tant, Brooks contends that hybridity theory does not account for the centrality of land to Natives and the relationship between land and Native community: "As envisioned herein, American Indian Literary Nationalism is a dynamic model that posits the existence of a field of Native American literature and supports (but does not advocate exclusively for) scholarship that draws on theoretical and epistemological models that arise from indig- enous languages and literatures, as well as the many, varied, complex, and changing modes in which Native nations have operated on the ground, in particular places, over a wide expanse of time" (244). Brooks echoes the theme of adaptation and transformation rather than hybridity as a way of understanding Native lifeways and literatures, helping to make American Indian Literary Nationalism a powerful, provocative, and valuable contribu- tion to the study of Native literature and Native American studies. James Cox's Muting White Noise: Native American and European American Novel Traditions is exciting, insightful, and highly accessible and will be valuable to all teachers of Native and Euro-American lit- eratures. Cox demonstrates how numerous canonical Euro-American- authored texts create narratives of doom that erase Indians and argues that the Native American novel has historically responded to these nar- ratives of conquest and erasure (95-99). Native writers revise Eurowestern texts in ways that can actually unmake colonialism. Cox argues that cul- tures are guided by the stories they tell, and for Euro-Americans those stories have historically been of domination and conquest (the Bible, the Columbus mythology, The Last of the Mohicans , for example). Cox, who is non-Native, argues that colonialism and colonial texts demonstrate a failure of the imagination, the failure to imagine alternatives to violence and domination. The white noise in his title comes from Sherman Alexie's use of the late-night static on the television screen; Cox asserts that Alexie "identifies a direct correlation between popular culture pro- ductions - such as films, television programs, pop songs, New Age books, radio talk shows, and mystery novels - and the many forms of violence perpetrated against contemporary Native people" (146). Cox takes seriously the claims of numerous Native scholars that their work can and should privilege "Native sources in the reading of novels by Native authors, [which] then uses the work of these Native authors as a critical lens through which to read the traditional and revised European American literary canon" (5). Cox investigates how particular Native writers revise Eurowestern texts with a focus on early</page><page sequence="6">Johnson and Johnson 431 twentieth-century novelists John Rollin Ridge (Cherokee), Mourning Dove (Okanogan), and DArcy McNickle (enrolled Salish), and contem- porary novelists Thomas King (Cherokee), Gerald Vizenor (Chippewa), and Sherman Alexie (Coeur dAlene/Spokane): "In a novel such as Green Grass , Running Water ; and in much of the work of Gerald Vizenor and Sherman Alexie, the frequent critical allusions by Native authors to non-Native texts such as the bible become intensive revisions of these narratives" (61). Cox then does "red readings" - a term he borrows from Jill Carter (Anishinabe) - of Euro-American canonical writers such as James Fenimore Cooper, Herman Melville, Jack London, and Frank Norris. Red readings foreground issues of importance to Native people, communities, and sovereignty. Instead of focusing on what non-Native authors' depictions of Indians tell us about Euro-Americans, "Natives writers focus on the present and their presence, on survival and resistance ... red readings also focus on the many ways that non-Native authors foreclose on an Indian future and imagine an inevitable Native absence from the landscape" (12). Most provocatively, Cox questions the unstable nature of conquest: "Perhaps the most consistent definition of conquest in the U.S. colonial context is the domination of this part of the world by Eurowestern sto- ries" (253, 252). He argues that the terms conquest and victory "are far too limiting to provide a clear understanding of the cultural and historical contexts of colonialism in the Americas" and that "with their con- stant suspicion and frequent revision of the textual narration of Native absence, Native storytellers reject the idea that a conquest ever took place" (253). In fact, Cox argues, "the only conquest that occurred is the one in the colonial text" (254). Native texts demonstrate that the "nar- ratives of annihilation and absence" in Eurowestern texts do not reflect Native reality. As seen through the work of Native novelists, Indians are not victims but imaginative, compassionate survivors who tell stories that "empower and nourish" (255). Like novels, popular films shape and reflect the beliefs and values of the audiences who view them. This hegemonic process seldom includes a (re)shaping of beliefs and values, but, rather, films mostly assure the audience that social/cultural realities are a reflection of the prevailing ideology. In Killing the Indian Maiden: Images of Native American Women in Film , M. Elise Marrubio's careful, scholarly examination of Native American film images from the early silent film era to the 1990s in the United States provides a critical analysis of film techniques - camera angles, close-ups, lighting, composition, backdrops, costumes - and simul- taneously constructs a critique of how film images of Indian women served</page><page sequence="7">432 Western American Literature Winter 2008 (and continue to serve) the "nationalizing myths" central to the ideology of American exceptionalism and Manifest Destiny (8), Marrubio begins her analysis with the emergence of "The Celluloid Maiden," a cultural icon more complex than the limited representation of Native women as "squaws." The author attributes the power of this specific image to its "multidimensionality and longevity" and proceeds to provide detailed discussions of three film images, "The Celluloid Princess," "The Sexualized Maiden," and "The Hybrid Celluloid Maiden" (4). As the author states in her introductory chapter, these are not simply Hollywood's representation of a romanticized, tragic icon, but images that reinforce "cultural narratives of nation building and national identity" (21). Thus, the author provides the reader with a detailed and well-crafted analysis of social/cultural/racial history through her critical discussion of film images of Native women. The representation of the Celluloid Princess sets the pattern for the images of Native women that evolve as the film industry reflects chang- ing social values and practices. According to the author, the Celluloid Princess and her descendants are typified in film representation(s) of Pocahontas due, in part, to her "reaUife narrative which contains many parallels to the Princess image" (13). A short list of these parallels include her conversion to Christianity, her saving the white-male-hero figure, her marriage to a white man, and her ultimate sacrifice - death. The author expands on these criteria throughout the text as she dis- cusses the "princess" image as "anthropomorphic" and "primitive" (168). In her discussion of the character Sonseehray in Broken Arrow (1950), the author points out the earlier film images that are elaborated upon in the 1950s. She writes, "Accentuating the qualities of goodness and innocence found in the silent-period figures but erasing the hint of taint attached to the earlier figure's sexual freedom, the film heightens the figure's exotic status" (66). In each section of the book, the author employs a set of crite- ria - innocence, edenesque imagery, assimilation, romanticized cultural identity, sacrifice for the "superior" goals of progress and reason - and discusses how this iconography is (re)presented and (re) inscribed by the film industry. In the concluding chapter, Marrubio argues they are challenged and/or disrupted in a handful of films - Thunderheart (1992), Silent Tongues (1993), Incident at Oglala (1992), and films made by tribally affiliated producers, Naturally Native (1999), Grand Avenue (1996), Smoke Signals (1998) - however, she claims that "perhaps the most obvious evidence of the figure's power and reliance resides in its emergence in a cluster of films released from the late 1980s through the</page><page sequence="8">Johnson and Johnson 433 1990s: including Black Robe ( 1991 ) and A River Runs Through It (1992)" (222). In the concluding discussion, the resilience and hegemony of images, especially in popular culture venues such as film, are articulated as an existing presence in societies constructed on racial and economic disparities. In making this case, Marrubio places her text in a wider, deeper discussion of racialized images in the (re)construction of imperi- alism and colonialism in our society: "Looking back over the past ninety years of images, one is struck by how often the figure chafes against the most liberal aims of the film" (220). The reflections and intersections of regimes of power should come as no surprise to those who use a critical theory lens to study historic periods - totalizing systems must present a unified image of "reality." The intersections of race and power are central in Sam A. Maddra's Hostiles ? The Lakota Ghost Dance and Buffalo Bill's Wild West This highly readable book provides an account of historic and symbolic events in 1891 and 1892 surrounding the newly formed reservation system on the Plains and the ideology-laden wrestling match between policy makers and social reformers in Washington, DC, that comes to a head in the pageantry of Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West shows. Relying upon news- paper accounts, primarily from the British press, personal and profes- sional correspondence between power brokers and social reformers, and provocative interviews with Sioux leaders who played themselves in the Wild West shows, Maddra's book is a rich and nuanced examination of both an emerging Indian policy embedded within the larger goals of nation-building in the United States and an articulate rendering of tribal resistance to and transformation of these goals. Central to the events (re)viewed in this text is the careful exami- nation of the role of the Ghost Dance as a tribal response to cultural genocide and the evolving legitimation and enforcement of assimila- tionist ideologies by the governing bodies - the Department of War, the Department of the Interior, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs - as well as a number of lobbying groups such as Friends of the Indians. Also highly involved in this scramble to design and control an Indian policy that would solidify the claims to illegal land grabs supported by military actions were a myriad of Protestant denominations intent upon dividing up the newly formed reservation into Christian(izing) missions and breaking the hold on existing missions by the Catholic Church. Maddra's analysis of the Ghost Dance not as simply a desperate response to cultural and spiritual genocide but as an adaptive performance pro- vides a much more nuanced and complex discussion of assimilation than the old binaries of colonized/colonizer.</page><page sequence="9">434 WESTERN AMERICAN LITERATURE WINTER 2008 Maddra positions the Plains tribes as limited negotiators rather than as defeated victims. The Ghost Dance, in the words of Short Bull, a Lakota who traveled to Nevada to speak to Wovoka (Paiute) about the ceremony, was a blend of Christian and indigenous beliefs. Maddra argues that despite its redemptive, not combative, focus, the Ghost Dance was viewed as an uprising, and the military force used to quell it resulted in the jailing of twenty- three Lakota and Sioux "hostiles" and precipitated the massacre known as Wounded Knee. At this point in Maddra's story, the intersection of popular culture and governmental policies occurs. The twenty-three "hostiles" were remanded to Colonel Wild Bill Cody and became performers in his Wild West show. Essential to the show was its claim of authenticity; European audiences were only interested in "real Indians." As Maddra states, "It is hard to imagine how Buffalo Bill's Wild West could have continued without Indian performers, for they were crucial to Cody's narrative of the conquest of America" (83). The Wild West show depended upon "hostiles" to draw in audiences and maintain its very profitable business, but the twenty- three prisoners grasped the opportunities available to them as members of this traveling show. The prisoners were given two choices: remain imprisoned at Fort Sheridan or "accompany Cody for one year, receive a wage of up to $50 a month, plus expenses, and then be returned to the agency without further consequence" (101). Ironically, Cody's advertis- ing claim that his show had the "most hostile" of the Plains Indians fueled the ongoing debate between social progressives and the paternal- istic Christian reformers who editorialized that any/all performances by the prisoners would be viewed by "hostile" as well as by peace-loving Indians as rewards for "evildoers" (108). Seeing the Ghost Dance and the Wild West shows from a critical position that insists on agency, self-actualization, and adaptation on the part of tribal people during the Reservation Era and relying on the nar- ratives of tribal figures such as Short Bull, Porcupine, and Kicking Bear, who participated in both performances, Maddra constructs a fascinating account of stories we thought we knew. He introduces the words of the dancers describing the pride in their performances and negotiating skills for wages that provide the reader with a very clear view of a rich and detailed example of adaptation and autonomy. Representations of Ghost Dancers and "hostile" Indians sold tickets all over Europe and provided an income for the tribal participants. And, yet, both of these images do more to mystify than to clarify if the narrative does not include the point of view of the Indian participants. The author's description of the</page><page sequence="10">JOHNSON AND JOHNSON 435 dancers' and riders' experiences in Europe generates an image of asser- tive equestrians who always understood the notion and execution of a performance and their monetary worth. The author interrupts many previous accounts of the Wild West shows and the Ghost Dance, pro- viding an excellent example of what can happen when Indian literary nationalism is used as a reading lens. We learn from these diverse and powerful books the importance of story and who gets to tell it.
