<plain_text><page sequence="1">Controlling Passion The Turn-of-the-Century Wallpaper Dilemma Jan Jennings CHANGES IN CULTURAL NORMS and in the production and marketing of con- sumer goods in the 1890 to 1i910o period allowed women to assume moral guardianship for their homes. Women's magazines, mail-order cat- alogues, and advice books disseminated sugges- tions for the decoration of the home interior. Manufacturers recognized housewives as a pri- mary target for sales, and new marketing strate- gies helped to fill American middle- and working- class homes with ready-made, mass-produced ob- jects. In the midst of this changing homescape, wall- paper, a seemingly benign material, became the object of friction between two groups who vied for the attention of the female consumer: manu- facturers and domestic reformers. At the turn of the century, manufacturers flooded the market with ornately patterned wallpapers and resorted to various means of tempting women to purchase these products. Tastemakers and domestic re- formers countered by characterizing such wallpa- per as a moral problem. Their criticisms, how- ever, were nothing new. In 1876, the editor of Harper's Bazar had even claimed that "Indiana di- vorce laws may be perhaps directly traced to some frightful inharmoniousness in wall-paper."1 By the 189os, these conflicting positions on wallpa- per reflected divergent values regarding new pat- terns of production, consumption, and family life. This essay considers the rhetorical dimen- sions of these cultural and commercial forces and suggests ways in which women either succumbed to sensuality or resisted it. Photographs offer evi- dence of feminine reactions to the dualistic mes- sages. From the middle of the nineteenth century forward, women had been encouraged to express their moral guardianship of their family's charac- ter through tasteful decoration. Mother imparted values indirectly by providing home surroundings through which family members could find tran- scendent meanings; in choosing objects, colors, and textures, a woman acted out her role as teacher through her tasteful arrangements: "The beautiful picture or softly tinted wall, the peaceful drapery may perhaps be the means of opening some fount of wisdom, else closely sealed, or touching some sensitive nerve of thought, other- wise dormant." Until well into the twentieth cen- tury, authors of advice literature argued that the Jan Jennings is associate professor in the Department of De- sign and Environmental Analysis, Cornell University. A U.S.D.A. Hatch grant and a Start Award from the College of Human Ecology, Cornell University, facilitated research of this article.

Appearing solely in wealthy homes at first, it eventually became an everyday treat- ment. Judging by articles that appeared in American builders' journals, such as "The Selection of Wall-Paper," Manufacturer and Builder 1, no. 3 (March 1869): 71; "The Plates," Carpentry and Building to (December 1888): 248; "Bad Effects in Wall Paper," Carpentry and Building to (December 1888): 263; "The Plates," Carpentry and Building 11 (September 1889): 172.

In 1915, home economist Ellen H. Richards could still argue that "a Home must stand for one's self," showing the taste and cultivation of its occupants.2 The Ornamental Aesthetic Prior to 188o, many households had done with- out wallpaper, calcimining their walls white. In 1869, however, a builder's journal stated that "one of the most important features in the deco- ration of the interior of dwelling-houses is the adorning of rooms by means of wall-paper." The year 1890 represented the height of popularity for an aesthetic derived from the various revival styles of nineteenth-century architecture. Parlors, upholstery, and decorative arts objects of this pe- riod were described by their manufacturers as "'rich' in appearance, 'elaborated,' well 'fin- ished,' 'elegant,' and 'ornamental' "; they were praised for their detail, for their "softened" or "softening" effect, and finally for their contribu- tion to the "refinement" of a room. This aes- thetic of refinement cut across categories of culture and society, linking commercialized prod- ucts such as wallpaper with genteel behavior fos- tered by etiquette manuals. Home economist Martha Van Rensselaer described the aesthetic in retrospect as a "complex mingling" of materials and arrangements, over-decorated to show off bric-a-brac. The constellation of effects that de- scribes the ornamental system of design pro- duced a layered interior in which the outcome of the design was cumulative.s Fig. 1. Postcard photograph of woman in wallpapered room, ca. 1910. (Private collection.) As we see in the photograph of an unidenti- fied woman posing in a corner of her home (fig. 1), the decor indicates the accumulation of the ornamental aesthetic: large-scale floor, ceiling, and wallpaper patterns and a door casing of lay- ered moldings. The three-part wallpaper design suggests an indoor garden setting: stylized motifs 2 As quoted in Henry T. Williams and Mrs. C. S.

Aesthetic is defined as "the set of guiding constructs for appre- ciating the world perceived by the senses, rather than the criticism of taste" (Katherine C. Grier, Culture and Comfort: People, Parlors, and Upholstery, z850-z93o [Rochester, N.Y: Strong Museum, 1988], p. 136). On the aesthetic of refinement, see Grier, Culture and Comfort, p. 132. In a study of American railroad architecture between 1815 and 1914, Caroll L. V. Meeks argues that "nine- teenth-century art and architecture combined a formal vocabu- lary of 'picturesqueness' with selective restatement of the orna- mental vocabulary of past historical styles." The formal qualities of the "special mode of vision" that he christened "picturesque eclecticism" were variations in silhouette and surface treatment, a sense of movement in masses and outline (which often took the form of asymmetry), visual intricacy, and roughness (or emphatic texture) (cited in Grier, Culture and Comfort, p. 154).

By the turn of the century, the use of wallpa- per to fulfill the ornamental aesthetic was com- monplace. Typically, walls were organized in two ways. One arrangement consisted of a high base- board of two or three pieces of wood, a wainscot, a large section of the wall that was papered (the filling or field), and a wallpaper frieze. In an alter- nate arrangement, if wallpaper covered the entire wall (baseboard to ceiling), as it does in figure i, the motifs in each layer would be different, and the ceiling finish, whether paper or plaster, added a fourth motif. The common technique of combining three different designs of various scales in a range of bright colorways for ceilings, borders, and side walls (sometimes with textured finishes such as embossing and even glitter), em- boldened walls as backgrounds for other home furnishings.4 Photographs of everyday rooms indicate that a large number of American middle-class and working-class families perceived paper with large and set designs as a suitable background for a wide range of two- and three-dimensional effects. In figure i, a framed landscape picture overlays the papered wall. Adjacent to the frame and above the woman's head hangs a calendar de- picting a classical figure, with her gown off the shoulder and a garland on her head. The practice of hanging pictures on top of ornamental wallpa- per may have become common because women saw their paper as artful and their walls as a gal- lery; the paper, portrait, and frame became a con- stellation of artful objects. The appeal of a paper pattern that divided motifs into "separate spots" may have been the perception that the individ- ual motif was a figure of art.5 Taken together, "spotty" walls acted as a decorative arts collection of two-dimensional printed figures cohabiting with other objects. Home economists and social workers urged women to use reproduction art on their walls. Such reformers, Van Rensselaer among them, re- lied on a familiar theme: "Pictures not alone adorn the home, but stand for development of character." Van Rensselaer believed that pictures "educate the taste to the beauty in one's own community." She counseled women to cut repro- ductions from good magazines because they have "better pictures suitable for framing than were accessible in any inexpensive form twenty-five years ago."'6 More ephemeral images-calendars, magazine pages, and postcards-also hung on parlor walls alongside framed portraits, reproduc- tion art, and commemorative plaques. As reformers urged women to identify with their wallpaper, they implied that a woman should make a personal investment. If the paper she chose reflected herself, then the addition of personal artifacts enlivened and enforced the ef- fect, making the wall akin to looking in a mirror. A personalized wall of large-pattern wallpaper overlaid with family portraits and reproduction art helped to fill a room with people and orna- ment. When a woman, possibly Mrs. William North, posed for a photograph in her St. Paul home sometime around i 900 (fig. 2), she mimicked an engraving from Clarence Cook, House Beautiful (fig. 3). In the book Cook shows a woman in a comfortable chair, with her feet on a stool, read- ing a book. She is framed by arrangements of pot- tery and objects of art, which need not be expen- sive, in the case ofJapanese paintings of birds and flowers. The woman in figure 2 exudes the con- fidence of someone in charge of her family's character and her environment. Arranged above her head is a shrine of memorabilia-framed portraits, a bust of a classical figure, a fan opened 4 Sears, Roebuck pointed out that wallpaper's "cleanliness, durability, variety, and beauty are beyond question. There is no method of treating the walls that pleases so constantly, providing care be used in selecting the papers" (Sears, Roebuck, and Com- pany, Wall Paper Samples [Chicago, 1901], n.p.). Wallpapers at the turn of the century gleamed with iridescence-gold, gold bronze, bronze, and silver and green bronze papers were common. Sears's special 7-cent paper had "a cream background with beautiful scrolls in two shades of green, with gold outline" (Sears, Roebuck, and Company, 1902 Catalogue [Chicago, 1902], p. 906). 5 The precedent of hanging pictures on top of tapestry can be seen in W. H. Pyne's watercolors (David Watkin, The Royal Inte- riors ofRegency England from Watercolours First Published by W H. Pyne in 1817-182o [London:J. M. Dent and Sons, 1984], p. 18). Clar- ence Cook raised the possibility of individual motifs as figures of art in his nineteenth-century guide, What Shall We Do with Our Walls? (New York: Warren Fuller, 1881), p. 10o9, suggesting that wallpaper had two prospects: to retreat as a background for pic- tures and objects or to present itself as ornament. 6 Martha Van Rensselaer, "Decoration in the Farm Home," Cornell Reading-CourseforFarms' Wives i, no. 2 (December o 902): 28, 29. She suggested pictures of rural life for the walls of farm- houses. Sears and city art stores made framed reproduction art available to many Americans. In 1902 Sears offered an engraving of horse heads, studies in flowers and fruits, three "handsome" colored photographs, and "our special $1.95 facsimile of a genu- ine water color" (Sears, z9o2 Catalogue, p. 768). They also sold sentimental and historic scenes: a watercolor of a pastoral land- scape with farmhouse, an artograph of an agrarian scene with a farm couple and oxen, and a mother and child in peasant dress gathering sheaves of wheat.</page><page sequence="4">246 Winterthur Portfolio 3 :4 Fig. 2. A woman and her shrine of memorabilia, ca. 1900oo. (Minnesota Historical Society.) This is possi- bly the William North residence, 730 E. 4th St., St. Paul, Minn. for display, a prize-winning ribbon, and unframed portrait photographs that are tucked under the shelf, over and around one another. Her portrait suggests how women aligned themselves physi- cally with the images they arranged and how dec- orous both wall and woman were to be. Passive walls became the sites for active shrines, trans- forming the wall into an intimate screen with a proportional scale akin to a decorative object.7 Women may have been attempting to calm showy paper patterns with their overlay of cultural im- ages and objects that represented their more per- sonal selves or the faces of those important to them. Although ornamental wallpaper met the "de- mand felt for a decoration suited to the require- ments of the prevailing style in architecture," tastemakers and reformers in the late nineteenth century began to urge an alternative aesthetic.8 Dissatisfied with previous design values, they called on the moral position established by John Ruskin and William Morris in the English arts and crafts movement. Ruskin and Morris's rejection of industrially produced goods, their support for craft and appropriate use of materials, and their belief in simplicity as an all-encompassing aes- thetic found some acceptance in the United 7 Clarence Cook, The House Beautiful (New York: Scribner, Armstrong, 1878), pl. 40. According to a 1907 study by Caroline Frear Burk, the tendency to collect and arrange objects begins in girlhood. Burk studied the psychological instinct for collecting in 1,214 children and adolescents from Santa Barbara and Santa Rosa, Calif. Of the sample, girls collected photographs, pictures, and Kodak prints more than boys did. Some collections were ex- clusively gender oriented; only girls collected calling cards, invita- tions, tintypes, and posters. Although girls and boys did not clas- sify their collections by variety or kind, the collected objects were "kept together" in some form--in a drawer, on a shelf, or fas- tened on cloth, paper, or ribbons (Caroline Frear Burk, "The Collecting Instinct," in G. Stanley Hall, ed., Aspects of Child Life and Education [Boston: Ginn, 1907], pp. 207, 212, 216). A shrine had its model in the middle-class parlor. Occupants created com- plete "shrines into which is placed all that is most precious" in the realm of education, high culture, sentiment, and domesticity (Grier, Culture and Comfort, p. 59). 8 "The Plates," (1888), p. 248.</page><page sequence="5">Controlling Passion 247 Fig. 3.

The movement became a new arbiter of taste and presented a rational approach to design for progressive thinkers who sought to redefine women's role in the home environment. In the United States, however, the English arts and crafts movement's stylistic inclinations to- ward the Gothic and neoclassical became re- duced to generalized artistic effects at the hands of market-conscious distributors. Catalogue com- panies, millwork companies, and builders' jour- nals used the term artistic to describe a number of individual products or ensembles inspired by design reformers, all of which used natural mate- rials and a color palette of natural tones. The ar- tistic interior depended on a two-part wall com- position, roughly divided into a one-quarter/ three-quarters wall or a one-third/two-thirds wall with a high dado or plate rail dividing the two. In 1909 the Remien and Kuhnert Company of Chicago showed a dining room with a trellis-pat- tern ceiling paper and a two-part artistic wall com- position favored by progressive reformers (fig. 4). The top one-third of the wall received a vertically oriented motif of naturalistic vine and blossom; the bottom two-thirds repeated the vertical delin- eation in a darker material. Recognizing the established role of house- wives as decisionmakers for most interior decora- tion, especially furniture and furnishings, wallpa- per manufacturers in the 1890 to 191go period resorted to various marketing techniques to tempt ordinary women to purchase their prod- ucts. One marketing scheme used by manufactur- ers and catalogue entrepreneurs such as Sears, Roebuck and Montgomery Ward encouraged women to hang their own paper. In so doing, manufacturers were following the lead of home economists who counseled women to take action: if the wallpaper was "very bad in color or pattern ... take it off and repaper the walls. It is not diffi- cult work, and many a woman has done it."o10 Early twentieth-centurywallpaper sample books from Sears and Montgomery Ward provide clues about gender roles and paperhanging in the ordi- nary home. The 190o8 Sears catalogue cover shows a man and a woman installing new wallpa- per." The woman stands with her back to the viewer, her body almost centered on the page. To her left, the man stands on scaffolding, towering above her head as he hangs the border. Standing with her hands on her hips (and presumably with her legs wide), she assumes a masculine pose. Her forceful posture is rigid, with all her attention fo- cused on supervising him. Visually, her stance dominates his superior elevation. Although she is clearly in charge, she does not do the actual work. The following year, Sears shifted their cover depiction from an anonymous male worker and his female supervisor to a husband and wife work- ing as a team.'2 A cutaway view from the wallpap- ered wall in the foreground through a windowlike opening reveals the space where the work is being done. The impression is akin to a candid snap- shot of an intimate domestic scene. Once again, the male figure remains in the background, but this time he places only one foot on the ladder. 9 "Use of Mouldings in Decoration," Carpentry and Building 19 (September 1906): 686-89; "Modern Picture Friezes," Ameri- can Carpenter and Builder (October 1906): 818-21. 10May Haggenbotham, "The House Beautiful," in Lucy Langdon Williams Wilson, ed., Handbook of Domestic Science and Household Arts for Use in Elementary Schools: A Manual for Teachers (New York: Macmillan Co., 1900), p. 21. 11 Sears, Roebuck, and Company, WallPaper (Chicago, 1908), cover. 12 Sears, Roebuck, and Company, WallPaper (Chicago, 19o9), cover.</page><page sequence="6">248 Winterthur Portfolio 3 z:4 Fig. 4.

Her figure dominates the fore- ground. She faces out, donned in an apron, past- ing a panel. With their backs to each other, they are confident in each other's skills. Her hand is light in the application of glue. She smiles; wall- papering is an easy job. Sears's cover illustrations and wallpaper man- uals pictured men climbing make-do scaffolds (boxes or kitchen chairs with boards between them) to hang borders. Women's work usually re- mained on the ground. However, in the 191o0 "how to hang wall paper" section of Montgomery Ward's sample book, a woman ascends to the higher plane. She is shown as a paperhanger in all six illustrations, even putting on a border (fig. 5).13 By 1915, Sears took the issue of men's and women's roles in buying paper and hanging it for granted; it was never represented again on a cover. When women became paperhangers, they gained another level of control over the appear- ance of rooms. Even though paperhanging was a skilled trade practiced by carpenters and paint- ers, wallpaper had a make-do quality about it that encouraged women to transform their rooms themselves. They could handle everything in- volved in changing walls, from selecting wallpa- per to installing it. Pattern, color, and ornament changed the perception of domestic space-flat, blank wall surfaces in every room offered women opportunities to control the nature of the wall it- self as a conceptual space. When housewives lay- ered their walls with ornamental designs and overlaid paper patterns with personalized arti- facts, such as photographs and mementos, the in- animate wall became a site for the expression of design values and for revealing economic status and aspirations. Between 1890 and 1910, manu- facturers therefore stepped up their sales appeals to the female customer.14 13 Montgomery Ward, Wall Paper at Wholesale Prices: Newest Styles for z91o (Chicago, 1910), pp. 1-7. Kate Sanborn leads us to believe that hanging wallpaper in the home was historically a family affair. She tells the story that George Washington, Lafa- yette, and Lafayette's aide-de-camp hung paper at Mount Vernon when Martha lamented she would not have it up in time for an important ball (Kate Sanborn, Old Time Wallpapers [Greenwich, Conn.: Literary Collector Press, 19o5], p. 63). 14 In a 1903 advertisement for Wall Papers and Wall Coverings: How to Select and Hang Them, Arthur Seymour Jennings acknowl- edged that paper was selected and hung by "decorators, paper- hangers, architects, builders, and house-owners" (Carpentry and Building 16 [July 1903]: xiii).</page><page sequence="7">Controlling Passion 249 Fig. 5. Woman hanging a border. From Montgomery Ward, Wall Paper at Wholesale Prices: Newest Styles for I91o (Chicago, 1910), p. 7. (Private collection.) The Marketing of Wallpaper as Sensuous Temptations The Alfred Peats wallpaper company of New York and Chicago took advantage of the popularity of women's magazines to reach "people of artistic taste," advertising their "prize-winning designs" in Ladies' World and Ladies' Home Journal. With a special rhetorical appeal, the company employed style language rarely used by Sears or Montgom- ery Ward to demonstrate that their "papers are all high class." They advertised "Tapestry, Dam- ask,... Louis IV, Empire,... Embossed Leather," noting that they had "over 2,ooo,ooo rolls of other papers carried in stock." Despite the style references, costs were not high-as little as three cents per roll.'5 Like the makers of other home furnishings such as architectural millwork, furniture, textiles, and floor coverings, wallpaper manufacturers is- sued bound catalogues illustrating their products in carefully chosen settings. These catalogues to the trade had a booklike format. Covers received special attention, pages were numbered, and color reproduction was used extensively. Poten- tial customers went to businesses to look at the catalogues and to make their choices away from the sites of installation. Trade catalogues were designed to make an ordinary material such as wallpaper appear as de- sirable as possible. The 1913 catalogue of Becker, Smith, and Page is a good example of the sales presentations that were intended to tantalize women with artfully arranged settings. The visual appeal began with a special hand-sewn cover of heavy parchmentlike paper delineated with an embossed, beaded border. A gold embossed seal with the company's name and catalogue date was placed slightly above center. With irregular edges, it appeared as a wax impression. The over- all message of the cover was of handmade, aged, and artful products.'6 The inside pages of the catalogue use three different graphic formats to reinforce the cover's (and the products') expression. In the first sec- tion, black and white one-point perspectives dom- inate each page. The line quality is sharp, and the shadows are so crisply rendered that the illustra- tions appear almost as elevational drawings. Each illustration contains three items: a single piece of furniture, such as a cabinet or table; an object as- sociated with the furniture's function, such as a vase; and a flat, wallpapered plane. The represen- tation isolates the wallpaper, the furniture, and the objects as precious artifacts with the aim of portraying their beauty and their relationship to one another. The second tack offers a more cus- tomary trade-catalogue representation in its two- point color perspectives of room settings. The array of objects and furniture pushes the papered wall further into the background, making wallpa- per an actor in a scene, rather than the star. The catalogue concludes with several pages devoted to groups of wallpaper designs. Each is composed of five squares, one in each corner and one cen- tered. Although each square contains a different 1'5 "Alfred Peats 1898 Prize Wall Paper," Ladies' World 19, no. 3 (March 1898): 23; "Alfred Peats Prize Wall Papers," Ladies' Home Journal 13, no. 3 (February 1896): 28. 16 Becker, Smith, and Page, 1gr3 (Philadelphia, 1913), pp. 1- 28.</page><page sequence="8">250 Winterthur Portfolio 3 :4 design, the designs are related by color, texture, and border treatment."7 Another catalogue type was the idea book, dis- tributed by drugstores that also sold wallpaper. Presented as complimentary gifts to customers, these books varied in size and number of pages, but all illustrated room settings rendered as color perspectives. Vignettes of ideal rooms published in both trade catalogues and idea books sug- gested combinations of elements that would be appropriate. The catalogues were visual provoca- tions, approximating a scene that might become real if the viewer bought the product and had enough imagination and skill to "build the pic- ture."'8 In addition to catalogues, trade cards were a popular marketing tool. They were mailed to po- tential customers by manufacturers' sales repre- sentatives during the first quarter of the twentieth century, attempting to create a more direct rela- tionship between buyer and salesman. The cards were akin to catalogue illustrations that pictured wallpaper in a room context. Like postcards, trade cards were printed as a single color plate on one side, with the back side used for a customer's address and a handwritten or printed message. The cards mailed by H. Birge and Sons in g o7 were vertically oriented with approximately a quarter of an inch margin at the top of the color plate and an inch of white space below, allowing the sales representative to write a brief message. S. A. Maxwell and Company issued trade cards during the same years as Birge but with pre- printed messages on the front and back sides of the cards. One card reads: "There's No Accom- plishment like good taste in dress or in your home. Attractive wall paper often succeeds where the finest furnishings have failed. We have the lat- est styles in Wall Paper."19 Some surviving trade cards provide glimpses into the relationship between business owners and clients. On January 12, 1910, George Shearer, a representative of the Western Wall Pa- per Company, sent a trade card to Mrs. H. Youse, Rural Route, Bunkerhill, Kansas. The reproduc- tion on the front of the card represented "The Home Beautiful" of one of the patterns shown in the comprehensive i 910 line of decorative wall- papers. On the back Shearer typed, "I have se- cured the agency for the decorative offering of the Western Wall Paper Co. I make interior dec- orating a special study, and, upon receipt of your request, I will call and show you the above line, their helpful book on interior decorations, 'Home Beautiful,' and offer suggestions on ap- propriate harmonious, and modern decorations for your home. Respectfully yours." Shearer signed his name in pencil.20 On the cold January day that the trade post- card arrived, unsolicited, at Mrs. Youse's home, multiple market forces swirled around like snow- flakes in a storm. Manufacturers hoped the card would have the capacity to coax Youse into a two- dimensional response much like the two sides of the card. The front suggested wallpaper as the background of an ideal home life-a cozy living room with fireplace, bookshelves, comfortable chairs, and color-coordinated furnishings. Shear- er's note on the back of the card was intended to capture Youse as a special client by offering his knowledge and service especially to her. Shearer's note to Youse elucidates one of the most fearsome challenges to a woman in her re- sponsibility to select wallpaper-how to deal with the salesman in person. In an 1896 article in La- dies' World, Frances E. Fryatt counseled that an- other woman should accompany the shopper "to stand by you and counteract the persuasions of the salesman. . . . If you have no knowledge of color or design, or the harmony of things, and put yourself unhesitatingly in the hands of the wall paper salesman, and he is clever and you are not worried by money limitations, the way is easy. The clever salesman will tell exactly what will suit your house. It makes no difference that he has 17 Becker, Smith, and Page, 1913, pp. 1-28. 18 Modern Wall Papers: '915 Idea Book (Ithaca, N.Y.: F. H. War- ner, 1915) comprises 14 vignettes of bedrooms, living rooms, and dining rooms. Each design has a trade name (the Loring, the Pas- telle, the Symphony), but the brand of paper, stock numbers, and prices are unidentified. The Rexall Store in West Union, Iowa, offered a hand-size paperback idea book, Interiors (Chicago: Fairthorn Co., n.d), which contains 7 color plates of interiors with an equal amount of text explaining the positive attributes of wall- paper as well as Rexall's expertise in helping customers make se- lections.

His chief concern is to sell the paper, so he soon finds how much you are willing to pay per roll."21 According to Fryatt, a salesman will show a shopper "everything there is in the store.., book after book until you become so bewildered by the multitudinous designs that you are glad to fall back on the salesman's superior judgment." Fry- att continued that women should have "a precon- ceived scheme" and "know what is, and what is not, agreeable, soothing, appropriate and alto- gether desirable." Fifteen years later, Helen Bink- erd Young restated the challenge, counseling that women should possess more knowledge than any male adviser, salesman, or paperhanger. Before deciding on the decoration for any particular room, one must first size up the situation. The paper hanger is not the person who can best decide whether your walls shall be this color or that, light or dark, plain or figured, for these things depend upon home condi- tions that he knows nothing about. The home-maker knows, as the decorator cannot know, for what the room is used, whether it is naturally light or dark, sunny or sunless, high or low, large or small, and what colors are present in woodwork, floor and furnishings. These are the considerations that should influence in- terior decoration.22 For the aesthetically turbulent period from 1890 to 1 910 o, few differences separated the tastes of small-town merchants or trade families from those of rural families. By the latter decades of the nineteenth cen- tury, plainswomen like Youse had begun to rely heavily upon mail-order catalogues. Sears, Roe- buck and Montgomery Ward first offered wallpa- per designs in their general merchandise cata- logues but at the turn of the century began publishing separate sample books. Sample books were smaller than they are today. Ward's 1910 version measured about 6 inches by 8 inches and contained forty-one designs. In 1902 Sears adver- tised their "big" wallpaper book as 18 inches square and about 11/2 inches thick. Occasionally, an elevation illustrating the side wall design was printed on the back of a sample. Elevations were especially helpful in seeing the whole wall since designs were just cut from a larger sample. For especially large patterns-medallions, scrolls, scenes, and panels-a small sample did not show the entire motif. For example, Ward's pattern number i610, the Empire Crown design, ap- peared in their sample book as a creamy, green mottled paper, the "ground" design between the panels of "green and gold with a narrow band of red to give it life" (fig. 6). The company fur- nished an elevation since they suggested that the tulip border be installed at the base. While a sam- ple was more immediate than a color perspective, it required imagining how the paper would look multiplied on all four walls of a room. With the sample book, women experienced firsthand the sensuous qualities of the material. If they wanted a variety of selections from different companies, they looked at books in a wallpaper store.23 Even before the proliferation of sample books, wallpaper manufacturers had initiated a sales ploy to place wallpaper in women's hands. Adver- tising in women's magazines, companies offered free samples of papers by mail. In 1893 the Charles M. N. Killen Company of Philadelphia ran an advertisement in Ladies' Home Companion. In a large typeface it announced "WALL PAPERS FREE!: on receipt of 5 cents for postage, we will mail the largest and best selected line of samples and lowest prices in the U.S. with instructions How to Paper."'24 The "high-class" Alfred Peats prize wallpapers were also available. Samples that arrived by mail could be viewed at leisure, reduc- 21 Frances E. Fryatt, "Selecting a Wall Paper," Ladies' World 17, no. 5 (May 1896): 20o. 22 Fryatt, "Selecting a Wall Paper," p. 2o. In a warning to women, a House Beautiful writer characterized a wallpaper dealer as a "hypocrite" who assures a shopper that "the things you like are stylish or very popular" ("At the Paper Hanger's," House Beautiful 5, no. 1 [December 1898]: 26).

The Sears and Montgomery Ward books also showed various moldings as well as supplies and equipment avail- able for purchase. As many new products came on the market, Sears used the front-matter section of sample books to announce goods for sale. By format, though, all sample books consisted of wallpaper designs bound together. Descriptive characteristics, such as the design number and cost per double roll and per single yard, were printed on the back of each sample (Sears, Wall Paper [19o8], p. 20); Sears, Roebuck, and Company, High-Grade Wall Papers: Season z9z5 (Chicago, 1915), pp. 9-11.

(Private collection.) ing the pressures of direct sales in a store. At- home samples also allowed women to examine the designs in relation to the colors, textures, and patterns of other furnishings. By the late nineteenth century, the responsi- bility to relate and to control all the decorative elements in the domestic interior rested upon or- dinary women who were inundated with a whirling mass of multiple choices presented in many media. Wallpaper selection was "one of the most arduous undertakings connected with home furnishing" because it challenged women to re- sist the sensuous character of the material itself, the abundance of designs in the marketplace, and the ploys of the salesman."25 To the buying public, manufacturers suc- ceeded in promoting wallpaper as a facile mate- rial capable of bridging two conflicting design systems: an ornamental aesthetic-with a predi- lection for decorative motifs, layered surfaces, and three-dimensional modeling-and an artistic aesthetic that respected the composition of line and plane. From 1890 to 1910o, sample books grew fatter with more design choices, trade cards flew through the mail, and more salesmen made their way through women's doors. Defining the Wallpaper Dilemma At the turn of the century, reformers worried about the lack of taste and fashion exhibited in women's wallpaper choices. Tastemakers, home economists, and other progressives countered the industry's apparently successful seduction of na- ive home decorators by warning women to take control of their walls. In magazine articles and home economics tracts, they expressed worries about the sensuousness of wallpaper as a material, 25 Fryatt, "Selecting a Wall Paper," p. 20o.</page><page sequence="11">Controlling Passion 253 the problems in making proper choices amid an abundance of hundreds of tempting designs, and the lure of the salesman's pitch. In this unlikely conflict, two domains were at stake: one moral, the other economic. Before the hostilities ended, the propaganda from both sides became fierce; the market coerced, and the advisers railed. Two waves of reformers criticized wallpaper. From 1870 to 1896, tastemakers such as Henry T. Williams and Mrs. C. S. Jones, Clarence Cook, Candace Wheeler, and Frances E. Fryatt, among others, wrote prescriptively about taste in books and magazines aimed at the middle and upper classes. The second wave of reformers, from 1897 to 191 1, reiterated the nineteenth-century philos- ophy that architecture and home decoration ex- erted a formative effect on the family's moral character. These reformers included new female voices-home economists as well as social work- ers and women activists who also saw themselves as experts about wall decoration."26 College-trained professional women and fac- ulty in home economics programs were inter- ested in teaching women practical and standard- ized housekeeping practices. Their rhetoric rested on scientific substance and reliability. They employed a new medium-the home economics manual used as texts in high school and college courses and sold popularly in bookstores-to reach a large population of middle-class women. Ellen Richards's The Cost of Living as Modified by Sanitary Science was in print continuously from 1899 to 1915 and boasted a third printing of 8,oo000 copies. Maria Parloa's Home Economics: A Practical Guide in Every Branch of Housekeeping sold well from 1898 to 1919.27 In 1900 Martha Van Rensselaer established extension work among farmers' wives through Cornell University's college of agriculture. She began with Reading-Courses for Farmers' Wives, which combined new techniques with well-estab- lished means of agricultural education. Although Van Rensselaer was responsible for the first brief about household decoration, all subsequent Cor- nell bulletins about the house and its furnishings were written by Helen Binkerd Young, a 1900 graduate of Cornell's architecture program. Young took the lead in intensifying the rhetorical argument against particular characteristics of wallpaper. She also restated the old argument: "The spirit of the interior of the house is as vital as the spirit of a person. It must be a simple, ster- ling expression of the life within; otherwise it is a mere chaos of wood and textile.""28 Home economists believed that in order to be- come intelligent consumers, women should be educated in art principles and housing design. In- fluenced aesthetically by the English arts and crafts movement, educators quoted Morris and referenced Japanese design as models that avoided the "complex mingling" of the orna- mental aesthetic. Characterizing overly decorated walls as those "clamoring for notice," they pressed the idea that modest walls were quiet and plain. The concept that beauty could be achieved by simplicity and utility suited the home econo- mists' practical goals of easy-to-clean houses and furnishings that did not overtax the family bud- get. In promoting an artistic aesthetic, reformers offered it as the basis for a rational approach to design and disdained wallpaper as the epitome of manufactured goods that lacked taste.29 Wallpaper reformers identified two general categories of problems. First, the accessibility of wallpaper meant that women from a wide range 26 Williams and Jones, Beautiful Homes, p. 3; Cook, What Shall We Do With Our Walls?; Candace Wheeler, "Decoration of Walls," The Outlook 52 (November 2, 1895): 706; Fryatt, "Selecting a Wall Paper," p. 20. 27 Richards, Cost of Living, p. 135; Maria Parloa, Home Econom- ics: A Practical Guide in Every Branch of Housekeeping (New York: Century Company, 1910o), p. 21. 28 For a biography of Van Rensselaer and a description of pro- gressive farmhouse design at the turn of the century, see Sally McMurry, Families and Farmhouses in Nineteenth-Century America: Ver- nacular Design and Social Change (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988), pp. 209-19.

Extension bulletins were written eventually by many of the early land-grant colleges, from the State College for Women in Denton, Texas, to the Kansas State Agricultural College in Manhattan. However, Cornell's series, from 1902 to 1916, was responsible for most of the bulletins about household decoration. Iowa State College made its entry in 1913 with Home Furnishing in 1914 Ohio State University offered Home Decoration.

Alymyra (Weiss) Eichlin, Norwalk, Conn., 1902. (Private collection.) of social backgrounds in diverse geographic loca- tions could readily obtain it. Manufacturers' mar- keting made sure that women knew wallpaper was less expensive than other wall finishes and fur- nishings and offered a variety of venues for shop- ping. Further, women could and did do their own paperhanging. But accessibility also meant that a large number of women possessed the opportu- nity to make poor choices, especially if they were confronted by a salesman. Second, wallpaper manufacturers perpetuated the ornamental aes- thetic that home economists and other progres- sives attempted to eradicate. In 19go2 Van Renssel- aer summarized the problem: "The amount of wall decoration and the great number of designs in wall paper are very nearly our undoing in try- ing to preserve artistic simplicity."'3 Home econo- mists, linking artistic taste to the notion of ratio- nal consumption, attacked the popular taste as unsuitably passionate and set themselves up as in- termediaries between maker and consumer. Reformers' admonitions crossed class lines, from the middle class to rural women to the work- ing-class immigrant; all women, regardless of their class status, income, or geographic location were believed to be susceptible to the sensuous qualities of wallpaper. Like many other consumer goods, wallpaper's affordability and availability helped to democratize the American interior and to blur the apparent boundaries of social class. In 1902 the fashionable Weiss family of Norwalk, Connecticut, posed their only daughter, Almyra, with her dolls and toys in front of their parlor wall (fig. 7). The bold design of the Weiss's parlor is strikingly similar to that of a Slavic family parlor near Pittsburgh, shown in a 1910o photograph that was published in a study of steelworkers' fam- ilies and their domestic and milltown life. The au- thor describes the parlor as belonging to one of the oldest inhabitants of that Slavic community. 3So Van Rensselaer, "Decoration in the Farm Home," p. 25.</page><page sequence="13">Controlling Passion 255 The "well-to-do" Slavic family decorated their walls in vivid color to relieve the severity of the room. The wide range in materials and prices of paper hangings, from the cheapest pulps to the Japanese leathers, were available for houses of all classes and for all conditions of life. The same sense of fashion in wallpaper purchased by the merchant Weiss family could be achieved by a first-generation immigrant mill family.31 Reformers taught both the middle-class pro- fessional woman and the working-class working girl that large patterns for walls were not just un- fashionable and tasteless but anathema to the new rules of equanimity in domestic politics and the development of the new modern woman. The era's new female voluntary associations and social activists included the discussion of walls in their domestic education of working-class, immigrant, and poor women. Jane Addams, who in 1889 es- tablished the settlement-house movement in Chicago, believed in their educational potential. Clients of her Hull-House could borrow repro- ductions of European masterpieces to hang in their rooms, a strategy designed to wean them from an insistence on garish, unhealthy wall- paper. In a guide to planning, "Housekeeping Centers," housing reformer Mabel Kittredge de- fined the new aesthetic for tenements-unclut- tered furniture surfaces, iron beds, nonuphol- stered chairs. Walls were to be painted, not papered, because of paper's tendency to harbor vermin. Reformers who influenced workers' home environments also used the new aesthetic to promote social improvement and cultural ho- mogeneity. 32 While reformers thought of wallpaper as an evil, working women regarded it as a privilege possible with prosperity. An occupant of U.S. Steel company housing in Gary, Indiana, argued with the company decorator over the interior treatment of her house. On the outside, the house remained like all the rest in the row, but indoors, using stencil designs, she painted the walls with borders at the top and panels running down to the floor, replicating in paint the bor- ders and backgrounds of wallpaper design.33 Women in frontier and rural homes also changed wall surfaces with decoration. Western historian Glenda Riley argues that even on the frontier, the primary focus of women's lives was domestic. Women schooled in nineteenth-cen- tury principles of domesticity were hesitant to abandon them, even though the standards they sought were difficult to achieve. Women in the prairie region of Iowa, western Indiana, northern Missouri, and parts of Illinois and Minnesota turned their humble soddies into "elegant dug- outs" with the use of wallpaper, newspaper, or whitewash.34 To counter the market forces perpetuating or- namental paper, reformers turned to a previous criticism, citing the unhealthy effects of wallpaper in general and the ill effects of color in particular. As early as 1869, W. W. Hall, a New York medical doctor, had established color as a health hazard. He warned women to use no paper that had a fuzzy green color because it was composed of ar- senic, "capable of causing convulsions and fatal disease in a single night. Children have been taken extremely ill after playing a few hours in a small room covered with paper which had consid- erable green-colored patterns on it." The argu- ment had a certain validity, as bright green wall- paper contained an arsenic pigment known as Paris Green. Nineteenth-century Michigan con- 31Although the middle class is often described as the non- manual sector (downtown businessmen, retailers, owners and su- perintendents of manufacturing establishments, and clerks), this definition does not always account for class perceptions in small towns and dispersed farm communities of the Midwest and West (Stuart M. Blumin, The Emergence of the Middle Class: Social Experi- ence in the American City, r76o-19oo [New York: Cambridge Uni- versity Press, 1989], p. 310 o). Margaret F. Byington, Homestead: The Households of a Mill Town (New York: Charities Publication Com- mittee, 1910), supp. foll. p. 152. Social scientists even used wallpa- per as a measure of middle-class domestic imagery. In The Negro American Family (1909; reprint, Cambridge: M.I.T. Press, 1970), PP. 54-80, W. E. B. Du Bois characterizes the interior furnishings of village homes, city homes, and city homes of the "better class." 32Jane Addams, "Art Work," as cited in Allen F.

Kedzie showed that Paris Green was weakly bonded to the paper and came off in the form of a fine dust, which floated in the air and was inhaled by the occupants of a room. The more dust inhaled, the more severe the symptoms of arsenic poisoning: bronchitis, rheu- matism, loss of weight, severe headaches, and de- bility leading to death. Since Paris Green was a popular color in widespread use, Kedzie bought eighty rolls of the arsenic-impregnated wallpaper in 1874, bound them into books, and sent copies to one hundred libraries in the state of Michigan. The volume, Shadows from the Walls of Death, con- tained eight pages of wallpaper with the deadly pigment.35 Turn-of-the-century reformers extended Hall's finding by arguing that the colors of wallpaper could affect the mental health of family members. Candace Wheeler suggested that "color is the be- neficent angel or the malicious devil of the house. Properly understood and successfully en- treated, it is the most powerful mental influence of the home; but if totally disregarded or igno- rantly dealt with, it is able to introduce an ele- ment of unrest, to refuse healing to tired nerves and overtasked energies, to stir up anger and mal- ice and all unseen enemies that lie in wait for vic- tims of weakness and fatigue." The color red gen- erated a long-lasting criticism; red papers appeared as a popular wall color from the 186os forward and remained consistently in sample books. Writing for Ladies' World in 1896, Fryatt stated her view: "The writer was shown yesterday a paper vivid with red color. After looking at it for an instant, she did not wonder that bulls and turkeys are maddened at the sight of this color. The red must have been of the aniline order, for to the sensitively endowed organs of sight, aniline colors, even aniline blues and greens and yellows, still more aniline reds, seem palpitatingly instinct with aggressive life. Beware of the color that has this property; it is hurtful to the eye, and fades to an ugly condition." Young later suggested that "color experiments have been tried on folks sick and well..,. colors that are strongly red have been found to be somewhat exciting."''36 From 1890 to 1910, manufacturers ignored the advice writers and produced at least one red wallpaper in every sample book. Montgomery Ward's 1910o book featured "a beautiful red" pa- per: "This is one of the finest red papers we have ever offered as owing to the design it can be uti- lized for most any room or style of decoration. The narrow stripes are printed in green and gold which expand about every six inches into gold roses and green leaves. Room moldings 11/2 inches wide in gold to match this paper. It is just the paper for a lower third in a Hall or Dining Room.""'7 Their paper demonstrates how manu- facturers blurred aesthetic lines to sell more pa- per. They recommended their paper for a two- part wall composition appropriate to the artistic aesthetic in 1910o. However, no artistic paper would have been bright red with gold accents. Warnings about the health detriments of red turned to suggestions about color theory. In gen- eral, most sages agreed that colors should harmo- nize. In 1890 Frank Smith, a plan book architect, stated that the woodwork's color and texture should coordinate with the paper. For example, "for maple, use a yellow, wavy-colored paper with a ceiling paper of a bluish tint and a little gilt." By 1911 Young advocated hues that came from nature and suggested soft colors for all large sur- faces such as walls. In a Lesson for the Farm Home, she illustrates her ideas for "an harmonious cor- ner in a north room. Walls and furnishings in soft browns and tans, with bits of color furnished in pillows and picture."''38 Young wanted women to rely on nature to counteract the forces of the market. 35 Critics prior to the 189os characterized wallpaper as "the invention of laziness and filth; they conceal dirt and noisomeness of every description" (W. W. Hall, The Guide-Board to Health, Peace, and Competence; or, The Road to Happy Old Age [Springfield, Mass.: D. E. Fisk, 1869], p. 683). However, through the years, wallpaper manufacturers made some inroads in the logic that wallpaper was not so dirty because it was easily replaceable.

Muted colors (and demeanor) were suggested for genteel men and respectable women. These be- liefs survived into the twentieth century: "You can generally tell what kind of wall paper a woman will like by the way she is dressed. ... If she wears quiet and subdued colors, then there is no use showing her strong colorings and flashy designs, but if she is loud and gay in her dress, then she will buy wall paper that will fairly scream at you." Increasingly though, the fashionable colors for wallpaper were based on colors for dress goods: "Women always select colors for their back- ground that they think will harmonize well with their dress and themselves.""9 The Animated Wall While the problem of unhealthful colors formed the first criticism of ornamental wallpaper, a sec- ond fault involved inappropriate patterns. This objection was nothing new. Realistic representa- tions of natural forms in upholstery and carpet had been a subject of mid nineteenth-century tastemakers. In High Life in New York (1854), Mrs. Ann S. Stephens ridiculed the fashionable dining room where the "figgers" on the parlor carpet "were so allfired gaudy." However, between 1890o and 1910, naturalistic representations of flowers, fruit, and landscapes still suited the popular taste and were commonly used in wallpaper designs. Young's extension course lessons used design the- ory to explain why contrasting patterns and natu- ralistic representation were inappropriate for walls: "Since a wall is a flat surface, designs should be flatly represented so as to lie tight to the wall. They should represent only two dimen- sions, length and breadth, not thickness. All shaded moldings or designs of any kind that imi- tate rounded forms are false in principle. A natu- ral rose or an actual grape vine crawling through an actual trellis is not good decoration. A floral Fig. 8. Wallpaper sample.

(Private collection.) wall paper should suggest to us the idea of a rose or other growth adapted to use on a flat surface- not a confusion of lifelike flowers bulging from the wall." Conventionalized design, which was central to the artistic aesthetic, was to be simple in form and color and applied in an orderly ar- rangement. Actual representation, like the paper with "green grapes perfectly colored" in Mont- gomery Ward's 1910 line (fig. 8), belonged only in pictures and statuary, and "even then it should not be so realistic in detail that we can see every wrinkle in a face or read the labels on all the books in the picture. Good art, in both pictures and decoration must leave something to the imagination." 40 Medallions and shield-shape and scroll pat- terns with "scrolly outline" were defined by Young as frivolous, meaningless, and a common type of distressing pattern. Young objected to the 39 John F.

(Private collection.) large size of the motif (approximately the same size as Alymyra Weiss's head and hat, see fig. 7) and also criticized the distance between motifs: "Figures should not be too far apart, else we are continuously surprised at each repetition and never get used to the idea." She recommended an allover pattern that was connected rather than one composed of separate spots. Motifs such as scrolls and medallions produced contrasts that made spotty walls, as seen in figure 9. Young con- cluded that "about seventy-five per cent of fig- ured wall papers are on the wrong principle; therefore, when in doubt about a pattern, choose a plain one."41 The preferred wall was a quiet wall, defined by the principles of simplicity, often interpreted as plainness. In 1881 Cook stated that quietness was not "dull or undecided in its tint. It should har- monize with the pictures and objects and diffuse the tone of the objects that hang upon it, but it should not be subordinate to them, neither over- crowding them nor making them look like iso- lated spots."42 Between 1890 and 1910, writers who assessed women's choices for paper vehemently de- nounced walls that did not "hold their place" and brightly colored and spottily patterned walls that "crowded" a room. The rhetoric escalated to language describing walls anthropomor- phically. Van Rensselaer's bulletin for farmers' wives suggests that visitors should not be struck by wall decorations. Wheeler complained, "It is to wallpaper that we owe most of the disturbing and mistaken decoration of our walls. Bunches of flowers seem to start out from every plan of sur- face, making it impossible to dodge them; or zig- zag forms writhe in platoons along the walls, until the unhappy occupant might almost as well be struggling with a nightmare." Young restated the lesson for farm women: "There is small encour- agement for relaxation in the sight of walls flaring 41 Young, "Household Decoration," p. 48. 42 Cook, What Shall We Do With Our Walls? pp. 17, 18.</page><page sequence="17">Controlling Passion 259 with color, writhing with scrolls, or peering with spots."43 In making wallpaper anthropomorphic, ad- vice writers equated the material with a living be- ing-a monster. They gave the monster a mascu- line temperament-bold, aggressive, strong, and overbearing. The most despised motifs were those associated with masculine warfare, the shields of armed combat, and the medallions of victory. In the final stages of the wallpaper con- flict, criticism swelled with gender-biased remarks laced with sexual innuendo. "A floral wall paper should not contain a confusion of lifelike flowers bulging from the wall." Ladies' World described a paper that "fairly glowed and throbbed with the viv- idness of its red coloring." When salesmen actu- ally crossed thresholds into private homes, en- counters between housewife and outsider were described like a seduction scene in a dime novel. Recall Fryatt's warning: the housewife became "so bewildered" that she "fell back on his judg- ment." If you "put yourself unhesitatingly in the hands of a salesman, and he is clever . .. theway is easy" (fig. io).44 Such rhetoric makes an interesting case for understanding the cultural complexities and in- terrelationships of popular sources such as wom- en's magazines, university extension bulletins, and feminist literature in the 1890 to 1915 pe- riod. It is not entirely clear when advice writers began to equate wallpaper with human beings, but in 1881 Cook described wallpaper: "No pa- per is 'good' in itself alone, its goodness, like that of human beings, is entirely relative." To Cook, quiet paper was the opposite of "staring or pro- nounced." In 1892 Charlotte Perkins Gilman's wallpaper descriptions in "The Yellow Wall Pa- per" borrowed from early critics: the "pattern is pronounced enough to constantly irritate ..., a florid arabesque, reminding one of a fungus." Gilman, like home economists and other domes- tic reformers of the Victorian era, believed in the emotional effect of the interior environment. Picking up Cook's analogy, she expanded the metaphor into a living creature: "The pattern lolls like a broken neck and two bulbous eyes stare at you upside down . . . up and down and sideways Fig. 1o. Postcard courting scene sent by Maurice, Lou- isville, Ky., to Miss Lillian Crowe, Woodbury, Ky., July 26, 19go7. (Private collection.) they crawl, and those absurd, unblinking eyes are everywhere. . . . This paper looks to me as if it knew what a vicious influence it had!" Gilman em- boldened the animation with action verbs: "It slaps you in the face, it knocks you down, and tram- ples upon you .. . It creeps all over the house. I find it hoveringin the dining-room, skulking in the parlor, hiding in the hall, lying in wait for me on the stairs."45 43Young, "Household Decoration," p. 45.

"The Yellow Wall-Paper," written in 1890o and published in 1892, re- ceived the widest critical acclaim of any of the nearly 200 short stories Gilman produced during her lifetime. Born into a family heritage of reformers, Gilman was the great-niece of author and abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe and the great-granddaughter of the influential preacher Lyman Beecher. In 1898 with the pub- lication of Women and Economics, her seminal and most famous work, Gilman quickly achieved an international reputation. Trans- lated into seven languages, the book established her as the author- ity on the relationship between female sexual oppression and eco- nomic dependence on men (Denise D. Knight, ed., "The Yellow Wall-Paper" and Selected Stories of Charlotte Perkins Gilman [Newark: University of Delaware Press, 1994], pp. I I, 16, 18, 6, 13).</page><page sequence="18">260 Winterthur Portfolio 3 z:4 When Gilman made wallpaper a metaphor for madness, it appears that she chose the material deliberately. She read women's magazines and witnessed both the groundswell for the ornamen- tal aesthetic and the subsequent criticism against it. Further, Gilman herself knew the principles of art; she had been trained in drawing and painting at the Rhode Island School of Design. She de- scribed her yellow paper as belonging to the orna- mental system: "bloated curves and flourishes" with "a frieze that adds wonderfully to the confu- sion." The female character stated, "I never saw a worse paper in my life. One of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin ... I know a little of the principle of design, and I know this thing was not arranged on any laws of radiation, or alternation, or repetition, or symme- try, or anything else that I ever heard of."'46 Gilman's fiction stands alongside that of tastemakers and progressive reformers who at- tempted to proselytize readers, but she separated herself philosophically from either camp. Her so- cialist and feminist ideology maintained that women who engaged in domestic housework to make their homes presentable perpetuated their subservient status and, in effect, transformed themselves into "house slaves," a topic she ad- dressed in Women and Economics and The Home: Its Work and Influence. She viewed the literature of her contemporaries with disdain, citing the limi- tations imposed by women's magazines. Over- looking her class bias, she insisted they were "not truly for women at all, but only for dressmakers, cooks, nurses, houseservants, and those who need books on etiquette.... These housekeeper's man- uals are not the literature of the new women." After the publication of "Yellow Wall-Paper," tastemakers and reformers eagerly adopted Gil- man's imagery-"I never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before"-to make a be- nign material come dangerously alive. In 1895 Wheeler stated that bad paper was akin to "strug- gling with a nightmare."'47 In 1911 Young, an architect in the home economist's camp, restated the language of Cook, Gilman, Fryatt, and Van Rensselaer as practical advice for farm women. When she wrote about "writhing" paper patterns, she imitated Gilman's "undulating wallpaper." Gilman's characteriza- tion of the yellow wallpaper as possessing odd fea- tures-"I can see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure"''-was echoed by Young: "Avoid se- lecting patterns that, viewed from a distance, sug- gest queer faces, human shapes, or other absurdi- ties. If a pattern suggests an odd resemblance once it is likely to do so again."48 Animating wallpaper into a metaphorical beast harshened and intensified previous criti- cisms based on good taste or art principles. Re- formers now counterposed desire with fear, esca- lating this rhetoric by equating wallpaper purchases with women's behavior generally. Irre- sponsible consumption was equal to inappropri- ate behavior and deserved admonition. This stance intended to scare a modest woman away from any passionate decision she might make hastily, perhaps on the basis of the sensuousness of the material. Logic followed: if a housewife acted irresponsibly about wallpaper, then her home, and, consequently, her family, would suf- fer for her mistake. By inference, if a woman's pa- pered walls were respectable, then she was too (see figs. 2, 3). The fact that the walls of a home were such a large and visible part of the house meant that visitors could tell immediately upon entry whether they were appropriate. The solution to the wallpaper dilemma in the minds of many reformers revolved around issues of control. Women were called on to curb their desire for colorful, ornately patterned wallpaper and to replace desire with preference. In this sce- nario, women acted as rational consumers on be- half of their families' welfare rather than react- ing to their own desires or the enticements of the market. Acting on choice derived from self- control reaffirmed women's moral authority in the home. Nineteenth-century etiquette books stressed the need to act with restraint in public and in urban centers. Middle-class women were coached to control their bodies by minimizing ex- 46 At the age of eighteen, Gilman may have considered herself a designer; she worked part-time teaching drawing, sold hand- painted stationery, and created advertising cards (Knight, "Yellow Wall-Paper, "p. i1).

On page 11, the protagonist states another design concept: "There is lack of sequence." 47 For more on Gilman and her publications, see Knight, "Yel- low Wall-Paper, "pp. 6, 25.

Gilman's story describes a woman who becomes increasingly exhausted because the yellow wallpaper possessed so much energy. In recommending plain paper over a figured one, Young reasoned that plainness was less tiring (Knight, "Yellow Wall-Paper," p. 3); Young, "Household Decoration," p. 53.

How- ever, changes were afoot. "By the end of the cen- tury, a sexual revolution was beginning, in which middle-class women moved about with fewer con- straints, encouraged by the development of the growing consumer economy in which they played such an indispensable role."49 Yet, as late as 1915, exercising control of self continued as a recurrent theme in home econom- ics manuals. Richards posed the concept of "con- scious choice." Like other home economists, she urged women to exercise their authority: "Mine own home, mine to control, to experiment with, mine for success or failure." She feared the ease with which money could be spent: "The habits of living for today..,. have taken away the incentive to thoughtful foresight and have blinded the purse-holders to the inevitable consequences of savage-like recklessness."''5 In Richards' view, lack of fiscal restraint resulted in reckless self-gratifi- cation. Applying restraint, holding emotions in check, and curbing desire constituted a virtuous life. The physical control and self-discipline de- manded by nineteenth-century etiquette were supported by equally exacting standards of emo- tional control. Middle-class women were confined to a significantly more restricted range of emo- tional expression than males and given special re- sponsibility to provide charm and comfort as part of the price of their subordination.51 Gilman and the domestic reformers estab- lished a classical dialectic stance pitting passion against reason. According to Greek thinkers, rea- son was a voluntary activity of the self-directed mind. Unlike emotion, reason permitted plan- ning and controlling actions. Emotion was con- sidered to be an unpredictable response, incom- patible with intelligent judgment. When people reacted with emotion, they were thought to re- gress to primitive, animal natures. At the turn of the century, uncontrolled and excessive sexual passion was seen as a cause of insanity, which sup- posedly had a higher incidence in females. In the delineation of gender roles, women were thought to be governed more by sentiment and emotion than men and to be more prone to emotional breakdown. Based on her own breakdown (but written with "embellishments and additions"), Gilman's protagonist in "The Yellow Wall-Paper" is slowly driven mad by her physician-husband while undergoing the rest-cure treatment from depression associated with postpartum syndrome. Gilman explores various themes of madness in her story. Her surrogate expressed nineteenth- century societal beliefs that anything stimulating was not appropriate for a modest woman: "I be- lieve that congenial work, with excitement and change, would do me good." Yet, admonished by her husband not to "neglect self-control, . . . I take pains to control myself. . . . He says that... a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency." Gilman cast her emotive heroine against the rea- soned rationality of her physician-husband, "practical in the extreme," and a sister-in-law who was a "perfect and enthusiastic house- keeper.' ''52 Harmony ruled as the primary recommenda- tion to temper passion, and not just in social life. It was transposed into the realm of wall decor. Even Gilman, who proclaimed her independence from house decoration, employed the ideals of re- strained beauty: "Innate lack of beauty in the home could be countered by Unity, Harmony, that unerring law of relation which keeps the past true to the whole-never too much here or there-all balanced and at rest: Restraint; no riot- ous excess, no rush from inadequacy to profu- sion."53 Advice writers agreed that wallpaper should be more like a woman-subdued and modest, co- operative rather than competitive. If a woman took the high plane by creating harmony and bal- ance in her interpersonal family relations, she could also achieve a harmonious combination of home objects. Good wallpaper was a metaphor for the virtues of femininity-unity, harmony, 49 Kasson, Rudeness and Civility, pp. 130-31. 50 Richards, Cost of Living, p. 135. Possessing good taste also meant restraint rather than freedom; see F. Schuyler Matthews, "Artistic Household," Ladies' Home Journal lo, no. 11 (October 1893): 25. Wheeler defined a woman of good taste as educated and possessing a cultivated power of selection (Candace Wheeler, Principles of Home Decoration with PracticalExamples [New York: Dou- bleday, 1903], p. 13).

Identifying a "clamoring for notice" as a male trait, Young concluded: "It is chiefly on the walls that we must rely for uniting our whole interior scheme . . . we must avoid the use of bright colors and showy patterns; these have no place in the modest home."54 Expelling bold wall- paper symbolically diminished masculine author- ity in both the home and the marketplace. Taking Advice Although reformers created an overblown rheto- ric about wallpaper and rational consumption (perhaps to counteract their own fears that women were prone to act on their passions), there is some evidence of popular resistance to reformers' admonitions against ornamental wall- paper and personal walls. First, until well after 1910o, manufacturers continued successfully to produce and sell the types of paper designs found most objectionable by the advocates of the new artistic aesthetic. Second, based on a small sample of dated interior photographs, women who hung "inappropriate" wallpaper of the 1880s and 189os did not replace it with more "correct" de- signs in the early twentieth century (see fig. 7). Although manufacturers and tastemakers encour- aged women to change and renew wall surfaces frequently, because it was less costly than remod- eling, wallpaper may have lasted on walls for many years.55 The photographic evidence is sketchy. When undated photographs are exam- ined, it is difficult to determine if the wallpaper is at the height of fashion or a ten- year-old treat- ment. A sequence of photographs of modest houses over time is also lacking. Given the time period, from 1890 to 1910o, there were increasing opportunities for the dis- semination of reformers' messages to reach women in regions far outside of Northeast. Women in the plains and prairie states received published advice from reformers such as Fryatt through magazines published on the East Coast. With the admission of women into the land-grant colleges, programs in home economics, taught by professional women with a mission, had been in- troduced in the 187os. By 1914 home economics was taught in grade schools and high schools in more than 3,500 towns and cities, throughout all states."56 Geographic location, away from north- eastern centers of reform, alone does not provide a substantial answer as to why some women sus- tained the ornamental aesthetic and its wallpa- pers past its prime. One answer may lie in the flawed dialectic strategy that reformers constructed. Posing mas- culine reason against feminine passion, they en- deavored to teach women to become rational housekeepers and consumers. Rationality was seen as akin to independent thought and action, but each group, depending on their motives, de- fined independence differently. Some, such as Gilman, labeled the woman/houseservant as too dependent on a man and her household for her definition of self: a "poor, care-hardened, home- dwarfed creature."57 Young defined indepen- dence in terms of being an informed consumer, one not susceptible to a salesman's wiles. It seems that reformers overlooked the reality that many women did possess self-confidence about making their own consumption choices in their house- hold, and, seen from their point of view, that self-confidence was a form of independence. Re- formers also ignored the power of traditional conceptions of femininity in the cultural con- struction of the period. As women papered floral motifs and layered the flowers with pictures of loved ones, they created a familiar feminine inte- rior domain. When reformers sought to banish the parlor for a more useful living room and the ornamental aesthetic for an artistic one, they used a narrow definition of functionality as a guideline for deco- ration. Ignoring the symbolism of furnishings, this conception limited itself solely to what was physically useful. Middle-class women in the early twentieth century retained their parlors because they thought more highly of their objects with sentimental associations than they did of new definitions of function. Based on photographs of the period, the parlor remained a site for a riot- ous overlay of decoration from the combined ef- 54 Young, "Household Decoration," p. 45. 55 Sears has retained no business records of the number of rolls produced or sold. Cook, What Shall We Do with Our Walls? p. 7, and Young, "Household Decoration," p. 49, counseled that "growing tired of a wall covering is nearly always an admission that it is designed on a wrong principle. If we wish really to be economic we should use wall coverings that will stand the test of satisfaction for a long period of time." 56 For a history of the home economics movements, see An- derson, Definitive Themes, pp. 1-1o. 57 Gilman is cited in Polly Wynn Allen, Building Domestic Lib- erty: Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Architectural Feminism (Amherst: Uni- versity of Massachusetts Press, 1988), p. 70o.

(Private collection.) fect of papered walls and ceilings, floor coverings, furnishings, and wall art.58 While advisers were urging homemakers to make rational design choices and manufacturers were tempting female consumers with more mar- ket choices, ordinary women had their own issues regarding control. To a large extent, women's daily lives were organized by monotonous rou- tines of good housekeeping. When nineteenth- century women recorded their lives in diaries, they wrote about the day-to-day tasks, the jars of jam put up and counted, the laundry washed, and the floors scrubbed. The practical tone in which everyday experiences were related indicates to some extent the control women had over their lives-the inner life of the psyche and the domes- tic scene."59 Regulated by daily tasks and disciplined by standards of moral living, women sought to con- trol the interior life of their selves and their households. However, western women learned that they had little control over the landscape out- side their windows. The isolation and desolation many women felt as they moved outside of the cultured Northeast could not be abated totally by proper furnishings. Sears sold wallpaper to women in remote places to decorate bare rooms and en- hance the solitary sameness of lives. In attempting to make a modest home, women such as DoraAlden of Eaton Rapids, Michigan, acted out a piece of America's social history. Alden established a rela- tionship with her walls and her rooms; she inter- acted with product literature and direct sales, and she probably read more than one piece of ad- vice about putting her home together (fig. i 1). 58 Grier, Culture and Comfort, pp. 62, 68, 69. Not all home economists agreed on the subject of ornamental wallpaper. In 1900oo May Haggenbotham recommended "a somewhat rich fig- ured paper" for the hall (Haggenbotham, "House Beautiful," p. 12). 9 In April 1894 Gertrude Vansant kept a diary of her family's 6-week, 550-mile trip in a covered wagon across the high plains of Texas. As matter-of-factly as she could, she recorded the meals eaten, the supplies bought, and the toothache of her sister, Eddie. The exasperating events of the trip read like enumerations. The passions of life and the tensions of relationships received little due; see Gertrude Vansant Redfearn, "Diary of the Trip to Texas: A Journey to the Far West- 1894," Panhandle-Plains Historical Re- view 43 (1970): 20-36.</page><page sequence="22">264 Winterthur Portfolio 3 I:4 From the postcard photograph she sent a New York aunt, it appears that Alden took control of her domestic life. Her walls, furniture, and furnishings appear deliberately chosen and arranged, fashionable but not altogether har- monious. Even with all that, the charms of a well- designed home could not compensate for soli- tude. "Dear Auntie. I got your letter O.K. We are all well. This is me in my sitting room. I got one of the cards of the last reunion. It is nice you were all there. I am looking for my mother here next week. I get pretty lonesome here."60 As we consider photographs of real women in their houses, we see walls treated as mosaics of color, pattern, and memorabilia. Despite the pub- lic debate about what women wanted and what was good for them, many women chose to retain ornamentation over simplicity on their walls. Re- garded by reformers as cluttered and crammed with the furnishings and objects of manufacture, nevertheless, the ornamental aesthetic endured well into the twentieth century largely because of its capacity to fill up empty spaces: "Bright or gayly papered walls have a way of crowding into a ,,61 room."61 Women may have escaped the realities of their home life or the landscape around them by con- ceptualizing their walls as interior gardens (see figs. 1, 7). Mixtures of "conflicting figures" ani- mated the interior in just the manner Van Rens- selaer and Young warned. Flowers sprung forward into rooms; reds and greens trimmed in gold brightened and enclosed interior spaces against the harsh landscape outside the windows. The wall as simulated garden effects provided a suit- able metaphor for the idealized images of homes depicted in magazines and catalogues (see figs. 4, 6, 8). Planting, weeding, and harvesting indicated the moral, harmonious, and healthful life women were to provide their families indoors. Ornamen- tal papers and animated walls remained popular because they expressed the feminine emotive state, an exuberant and vibrant "backside of their heart" that modest women would not dare pro- ject outdoors.62 Wallpaper was a powerful material; it ex- panded the opportunity for women to experi- ment with architectural and spatial perception, expanding or shrinking a room's dimensions. Through wallpaper, a woman could make her own internal landscape, and it could be as wild and colorful as she liked because she was express- ing a vitality of her own spirit. The act of shop- ping, sifting through myriad designs, making de- cisions, and installing wallpaper empowered women to experiment with their own houses in ways that were impossible with furnishings that could not be easily purchased or replaced. A woman learned that walls created an arena she could control by deciding how animated, how personal, or how modest she wanted them to be. The wallpaper dilemma reveals more about the cultural themes of the period than it does about taste, fashion, or social class. The friction between manufacturers and reformers offers one example of the way middle-class and small-town and rural women evaluated their circumstances, suppliers, and surroundings and how they adapted local references to the advice they read. The rhetorical arguments over wallpaper carried nineteenth-century issues of morality in the do- mestic interior into the twentieth century. 6 Postcard photograph, written September 22, 1913, by Dora Alden and postmarked September 23. 61 Young, "Household Decoration," p. 45. 62 Van Rensselaer, "Decoration in the Farm Home," p. 26. For a modern interpretation of feminine emotions: "What I fear and desire most in this world is passion.

It is not neutral. It reveals the backside of my heart" (Terry Tempest Williams, "Earth," Desert Quartet [New York: Pantheon Books, 1995], p. 5).</page></plain_text>
