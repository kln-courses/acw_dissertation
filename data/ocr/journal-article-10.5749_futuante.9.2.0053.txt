<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Peter C. van Wyck An Archive of Threat History cannot occur without the event of language [and]  without the corresponding emergence of an image. — Eduardo Cadava, Words of Light: Theses on the  Photography of History 1. Radium Gilbert. Photograph by 1. Invitation author. Several months ago I received a curious invitation. Could you  please make something like “a mutant crossing of Robert  Smithson’s ‘Monuments of Passaic’/‘Mirror Travels in the  Yucatan’ crossed with Chris Marker’s La Jetée?” wrote a curious  and complimentary journal editor. What a lovely, perfect, and  vexing image. And what a perfect impossibility. Marker’s poetic  photographic essay and Smithson’s geopoetics. Something  that might “account for your journey across both books, and  which would consist of your photographs and images for High- way of the Atom and Signs of Danger (and some that didn’t  make it into those books?), as well as some of the designs pro- duced for the WIPP monument that appear in Signs of Danger?”  In other words, “tennis courts, highways, plaques, maps, trees,  barges, warning signs, stones, obelisks, deserts, symbols,  drawings.” No stray dogs. No suckling pigs. I confess that the analogy here may be less along  the Marker/Smithson axis and more reminiscent of Hollis  Frampton. This would perhaps convey the parallel but disjunc- tive itineraries of the images and the text that follow. 2.

A history written not with lightning, but close; a history  written with the energy of restless, recalcitrant matter, matter  seeking its own repose, struggling toward the mute lifeless- ness of lead. I wish to convey some small piece of the story of the  nuclear, at least as I have been following it. For this, to para- phrase Stengers, is not simply a matter of power but an affair  of a process or processes that one must follow.1 If I were to try to situate myself in relation to all of this,  it might be to say that my concern has been about the con- stellation of effects wrought by atomic and nuclear threats  and disaster. In particular, I am interested in aspects of  memory in relation to traumatic transformations of place,  of landscape. What follows is an unfinished text, in relation to the curi- ous invitation, driven by images (some of which have appeared  in print, others not) taken from two book projects: Signs of  Danger: Waste, Trauma, and Nuclear Threat, and Highway of  the Atom. This is not so much a dialogue with the images as it  is a set of reflections or captions occasioned by the images. I  should point out— although this will be clear— that I am not  a photographer. My photographs are simply vague testimony,  bookmarks, gestures, and suggestions. 54 </page> <page sequence="3"> 3. Fused Sand. NWT Archives/ 3. Site Busse/N-1979-052: 4877. Great Bear Lake in Canada’s Northwest Territories is a vast  inland sea, nearly thirty- one thousand square kilometers. On  the far eastern shore, where no one lives today, just below  where the tree- line cuts across the immense glacial body of the  lake, carved into barely fathomable depths sometime in the  late Pleistocene, at the far end of what is now called McTavish  Arm, buttressed in ancient granites by the very western edge of  the Precambrian Shield, lies Port Radium. This land, home to  the Sahtú Dene for some number of millennia, is also a site of  considerable significance to Canada’s atomic history. A point  of origin, one might say, where a frontier economy, with its  currency of fur, shifted awkwardly toward the very contempo- rary projects of an atomic modernity. From here, on Great Bear  Lake, uranium ore was transported south by river and rail, leak- ing as it went, for processing at Port Hope, Ontario, and then  into the productive centers of World War II— The Manhattan  Project as it is conventionally known— subsequently extending  itself over the clear morning skies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,  and back again into the Dene community at Déline in the form  of cancers, stories, addictions, and depression. 4. Field Note: Yellowknife, August 2004 The morning spent with a Borgesian map of Great Bear Lake, by  the Mundy Map Company of Edmonton. It was produced about  the time that the radium boom took place on Great Bear Lake.  Probably 1931 or so. There is no date. It was produced quickly,  55 </page> <page sequence="4"> 4.

You could smell it, they said. 5. Punctum And then this. Taken at Port Radium in the 1930s, this image  like many in the archive, is undated. The people, unnamed. This one though, is striking. It is hard to know how to ad- dress it. A simple staged photograph. The snow makes it look  like spring. Both reading. One, a look of consternation, or is  it disbelief? The other, partially perched on a shipping drum,  with a look of amusement, delight. They do not appear to be  Dene; the parkas suggest they are Inuit, visitors from (further)  north, the Inuvialuit region.2 Perhaps the Coppermine area.  Why were they there? They may have had been visiting Caribou  Point— Edaiila, as the Dene call it— one of four headlands that  physically divide the arms of Great Bear Lake.3 In any case, from there it would have been just a short trek  across the ice to Port Radium. Seeking to know more about these anonymous people  posed at the site of the radium and uranium mine, I inquired  with the archive in Yellowknife. Could they, I asked, take a  56 </page> <page sequence="5"> closer look at the negative and tell me perhaps the date on the  Astro- Digest (it looks like it appears on the lower right of the  cover), and was there any other information about the image  itself or the unnamed readers pictured? A couple of hours later,  I received this reply: Hi. The only caption we have was added by the Archivist: [Unidentified man and woman reading magazines at  Port Radium.] And it’s actually a print so I’m not able to make out  the cover information either, sorry. So much for that. What is it that strikes me here? The  glasses? The pose? Their anonymity? The heavy gloves? The  likelihood that neither of them would possess the mode of  literacy that now pervaded their place. The advertisement for  the notorious border- blaster radio station XEAW. The chill- ing dramatic irony of the just- visible supertitle, “Tomorrow’s  Headlines.”4 It’s none of this, exactly. Or it’s all of it, and that they  were there, and that the photographer wanted to bring  together in such a way two “marginal curiosities.” A perfect  performance of the interesting yet ultimately fruitless re- search cul- de- sac. 6.

Eldorado Another way to tell this story is one that begins (or ends) at a  place quite far from here, at Library and Archives Canada where  there is a vast repository of such objects as one might wish to  relay into concepts. Of particular interest to me, this archive is  home to some thirty-f our meters of objects— more often called  records— belonging to Eldorado Nuclear Limited. From the terra nullius of the mid- Depression Canadian  North, Eldorado was to invent a decidedly modern North,  not once but twice, from a site on Great Bear Lake, at a place  known to some as Port Radium. From this place, Eldorado pio- neered two uniquely modern Canadian staples— staples that  created strange loops between the premodern fur- trade routes  and the very deadly projects of atomic modernity. This particular North began in 1930 with one of the richest  mines in the world— a “mineral museum,” it was called, featur- ing an abécédaire of minerals and metals, but most valuable of  all was the radium-b earing pitchblende. At the time, radium—  the most valuable commodity on earth— was held to be a sub- stance of miraculous power; it was action at a distance, a tonic  for health, scourge of the cancerous cell. And in the second  instance, this time at the dawn of the Second World War— with  an Eldorado transformed and fortified as a Corporation of the  Crown— as an Allied source of strategic uranium, ore that made  its transformed debut at Alamogordo in July of 1945, and then  reprised shortly thereafter, over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The aptly named Eldorado archive is a kind of black box,  a grail, on the Highway of the Atom. Largely inaccessible to  researchers since the time of its deposit, it contains papers—  the reports, minutes, and drafts, the marginalia and maps, and  photographs, sketches, tables, and figures— that collectively  58 </page> <page sequence="7"> might, one could imagine, divulge something about the details  of Canada’s involvement in a war effort to invent something  that promised to eradicate war itself. It is thus a repository— a fantastic abridgment of testi- monies and stories— of considerable interest to those who  may wish to understand this time through the optic of what  was kept and concealed, of the remains. And although I have  barely begun to traverse this potlatch of objects, what I know  already is what is not contained in this archive, or what is made  present only as an absence, as the inductive terminus of a via  negativa. Like so many projects that have and continue to take  place in the North of Canada, this archival absence refers  to the stories of those people who actually live there, who  labored on the Highway of the Atom, who watched as their  lands were contorted into a site of “national self- realization.”  Yet their story, their stories, remain closed for us in different  ways as well. Of course they are inaccessible, if by that we  mean geographically remote; a pious and ironic alibi. But more  than this, they are closed because we have not had ears with  which to hear them. But this wasn’t just a story of the dynamics of margin  and center in the development of a staple (although it is  certainly that). Nor is it just a vignette within the larger arc  of Canada’s atomic history (although it is that, too). There is  more. The Dene never really realized what they were up to.  There were white guys and machines; it was very busy, and  there was money. In any case, having already undergone the  catastrophe of the church, and finding themselves more or  less permanently ensconced in a village, the mining was just  another thing happening on their land. It wasn’t until much,  much later— the 1990s— that the Dene came to realize that the  project they had become involved in was in fact killing them  and had culminated in the massacre of over 227,000 Japanese  civilians and 30,000 or so Korean laborers. 8. Noeme The blind field is in some way constituted by something that  remains outside of the image. Or perhaps just certain im- ages— “a kind of subtle beyond— as if the image launched de- sire beyond what it permits us to see.”5 Beyond the image, yet  occasioned by it. Its lineage does not derive from the operator/ photographer/author/tourist/agent/whatever. It begins there,  one might suppose, but this beginning is also the moment of  its occlusion. Nor does it derive from the ontological claims of  the noeme; always in some manner a dispute about the im- age’s motivation, its mode of indexicality. Where Peirce might  point to a “blind compulsion,” evoking an existential bond,  59 </page> <page sequence="8"> 8.

Wounds To approach the history of the nuclear is in a way to deal with a  blind field of culture. In “A Difficulty in the Path of Psychoanalysis,” Freud wrote  about the great wounds of Western civilization, that is, the  wounds that undermined the “universal narcissism of men”—  the “three severe blows from the researches of science.”7 The  first had to do with the dwelling- place, earth, the oikos, and its  place in the cosmos as its unmoving center. This, he said, is as- sociated in our minds with the name and work of Copernicus . . .  [the] first blow, was thus, the cosmological one.”8 The second wound concerns animals, and the gulf pre- sumed between our nature and theirs. “We all know,” wrote  Freud, “that little more than half a century ago Charles Dar- win and his collaborators . . . put an end to this presumption  on the part of man.”9 This was the second great wound, the  biological blow. The third, the most wounding of all, he thought, was psy- chological in nature. This, of course was his own theory of the  unconscious. Scandalously, the ego is not master in its own  house.10 The cosmological, the biological, and the psychological.  The oikos wounded; the exception effaced; the subject divided.  And with this trinity of injury, one can posit a fourth. With the  advent of the nuclear, the security of the future— as a pact of  temporal continuity— is rendered an anachronous piece of  60 </page> <page sequence="9"> 9. MV Radium King. NWT Archives/ Busse/N-1979-052: 0615. social mythology (if not outright abolished) in two key senses.  First, as the future itself is no longer secure from threats of a  nuclear or toxic origin. No guarantees. The decisive accident  may already have taken place. And paradoxically, because of  this, the future itself comes under the dominion of the present  as the projective field of its ethical responsibility— a tempo- ral pact that we know very well is always and already broken.  A responsibility that hinges not on our continuity but on the  security of the future from placeless, toxic matter! The fourth wound we may say, is ontological. 10. Disaster Until quite recently the Dene of Great Bear Lake, and many  others along the Highway, knew nothing of radioactivity. Why  would they? How would one even translate such a concept? In  Inuktitut language, I am told, the concept of half- life translates  as half-h uman. In Slavey, the language of the Dene, there are  just no words to translate this. Today, that is, by now, many  other translations have been invented, some conceptual and  linguistic, and some decidedly material and corporeal. This of  course is only one sense of translate. For the Dene, as it appears to me at a distance, all of this  was instrumental in a process of completely resignifying the  preceding half century. Memory itself came under siege by a  knowledge that had the power to rewrite and resignify. It is not  that the pieces started to fall into place; there were just pieces.  Falling. An imperceptible tide of suspicion washed over the  past. In a stroke, lives lived in and around the mine, on the  61 </page> <page sequence="10"> 10. Earth Angel.

The health and abundance of fish and  game, the unimaginably vast lake, the land, upon which every- thing depends— all this was thrown into question. Domestic  life, the very intimacy of the home, the oikos, was also and  retroactively contaminated. Families began to recall that they  had been living with radioactive ore dust, ore bags repurposed  for domestic and sanitary uses, contaminated building materi- als scavenged and used elsewhere. Details gathered new and  grave significance. Dust and dirt became “tailings.” Hands not  washed became precautions not taken. Caribou and fish were  freighted with risk. Even, and perhaps particularly, the deaths  of those who had already passed were no longer secure. Sym- bolic death was denied to the dead. In this way, the past, their past, was itself rendered toxic  by virtue of a retroactive catastrophe of knowledge, a traumatic  reversal toward events not experienced as traumatic in the first  place. If we are to say that to experience a trauma is to experi- ence a causeless effect (causeless, because the traumatic  event exceeds the subject’s capacity to experience it in the first  place), then in this case there was, until recently, in a sense  neither cause or effect. Time and knowledge delivered both: not a history of disas- ter but history as disaster. 62 </page> <page sequence="11"> 11. Pochon’s Lab. 11. Gift The story also begins in the future. A future organized by the  present, of course. This could be in the great American desert,  at a nuclear waste burial site, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant,  WIPP, it’s called, where transuranic nuclear waste is now being  interred with the promise of its security from human intrusion  for three hundred generations. Ten thousand years. In the rear- view mirror, this would be the end of the last glaciation, more  or less. Or Finland, where the negative gift of the nuclear waste  requires the countergift of one hundred thousand years. Or perhaps it will begin in Japan in the Fukushima Prefec- ture where a little over a year ago a catastrophic clusterfuck  of events began to unfold, leaving us to watch a remarkable  global exercise in crowdsourcing, involving thousands of  people doing the research and analysis to try to understand a  situation in which the perpetrator, TEPCO, was also the prime  source of information, and where the regulatory function  concerned with safety is subservient to regulatory function  concerned with the promotion of nuclear power.11 63 </page> <page sequence="12"> 12. Landscape of Thorns, WIPP Design— 12. Accident concept by Michael Brill and art by At the time I was writing Signs of Danger, there were then two  Safdar Abidi. great nuclear indices— Three Mile Island (1979) and Chernobyl  (1986). Hiroshima and Nagasaki are a kind of third index,  concatenated in a proprietary piece of geo-e thical disavowal,  a mendacious metonymy. In North America, at least, these  events stand as repressed adventures particular to wartime  endeavors. In a word, they were not accidents.12 Today, things  have changed, although it is at this point difficult to say pre- cisely how. It has certainly become clear that an earthquake-  and-t sunami zone, crowded with 127 million people, is a risky  site for fifty- four aging nuclear reactors (only one of which is  presently in operation, one notes). And this anxiety of course reverberates elsewhere: in  the United States for example there are twenty- three identi- cal Fukushima- style GE Mark- 1 reactors at sixteen sites— in  Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota,  Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania,  and Vermont. 13.

Photograph towns— the Gnome detonation involved a three- kiloton nuclear  by author. device buried 1184 feet below ground in sedimentary salt. The  detonation was met with great local fanfare, featuring Edward  Teller giving an inspirational talk at the high school in Carlsbad,  and busses to bring more than five hundred visitors to observe  the event. Teller’s cheerleading for peaceful nukes was well  honed; he had previously lured a crowd in Alaska by saying  that nuclear explosives could be so controlled as to dig a har- bor in the shape of a polar bear, if desired.”13 The experiment took place on December 1, 1961. And  although it was intended as a fully contained explosion, within  several minutes of the detonation vapor began venting into the  atmosphere, sending a radioactive cloud across the region.14  It wasn’t until 1977 that the Department of Energy began to  decontaminate the site.15 An hour down the road, you can have lunch under- ground— at the “spectacular” Carlsbad Caverns, run by the  National Parks Service. 14. WIPP The corresponding problem for which the WIPP is now the  answer in perpetuity began as a pressing bureaucratic problem  in the 1950s, when Congress realized that the steady growth of  military nuclear infrastructure made no provision whatsoever  for the disposal of its nuclear wastes. Over the next decades,  technical and geo- scientific research suggested that a perma- nent repository was called for and, furthermore, that one of a  65 </page> <page sequence="14"> 14.

Wastes from commercial reactors has been handled differ- ently. Yucca Mountain was to have been the long- term storage  site. It could have contained seventy thousand metric tons of  spent fuel, slightly more than what is already stored at reactor  sites across the nation. But in 2010, 10 billion dollars later and  in the face of irresolvable design and environmental problems,  President Obama canceled the program. For the WIPP, no one was particularly concerned that  the interred waste be recoverable; the main concern was  that the geological matrix be predictably stable over a (very)  long period of time. The EPA, which became responsible for  the oversight of any nuclear waste disposal, subsequently  added a layer of complexity to the decidedly material prob- lem of stability and (relative) permanence. They decreed that  any waste repository must be marked with signs— the “most  permanent markers”— the purpose of which would be to deter  “inadvertent human intrusion” into the repository for a regula- tory period of ten thousand years. An impossible duration of  future— exceeding the very accumulation of past (if that’s the  right word), of historical past; and a purely arbitrary legislated  duration from the point of view of the toxicity of the materials  to be interred. 66 </page> <page sequence="15"> 15. WIPP Sign. Photograph by author. 15. Future What began as a more or less technical question of telluric  certitudes permuted into a cluster of semiotic aporias. 16. Threat Nuclear threats are awkward and dangerous and lively and  very difficult to picture. Like “natural” disasters, they can- not be adequately contained within an arithmetic of risk and  proba bility. As ecological threats— issuing in part from techno- social practices— they threaten the very basis of what supports  organic life, and they threaten too the very symbolic universe  within which threat itself has meaning. Such threats are, there- fore, irreducibly ethical as well. Traditionally we would say that risk is the term that medi- ates between cost and benefit. Risk, above all, is calculable.  To speak of ecological risks we must also allow that there  exists some degree of objective ground upon which to make  a comparison between costs and benefits. But to evaluate  a cost, one must have a conceptual grasp of its lineaments;  one must be able to point to an activity and say this exceeds,  in its distributive character, any possible benefit. But no such  judgment can be made on the order of costs and benefits. Such  judgments operate on incommensurables. Effects can exceed  causes temporally, spatially, and proportionally. Small cause.  Big effect. Has the disaster already happened? Unmoored from these coordinates, effects run amuck.  Causally, the picture can exceed any standard image of a  forensic accounting: not simply a complex and cascading  67 </page> <page sequence="16"> 16. Eldorado, Port Hope. Photograph causality in which causes cause causes to cause causes  by author. (Wilden)— which ultimately remains a (big) causality in linear  mode— but a situation in which, I would argue, figuring cau- sality as such becomes less important than the ability, and the  call, to creatively intervene within and among effects. A call for  writing, “or thought, or research, or critique— so that our posi- tion as respondents to a crisis is not simply one of observing  from a safe distance, but of being caught up in the machina- tions of the event.”16 What is dangerous and what is safe, what dosage is haz- ardous and what is not— such thresholds and limits obscure  the fact that they are at foremost creatures of politics and not  of the laboratory; objects of persuasion, not measurement.  Ecological threats are chimerical. 17. Signs In the media universe, the ongoing tragic events in Japan  spawned a kind of new comparative arithmetic of nuclear  disaster. Fukushima equals Three Mile Island plus a stagger- ingly large earthquake and equally staggering tsunami. Or,  Fukushima equals Chernobyl, minus its graphite and insanely  dangerous reactor design. It’s not Chernobyl, Japanese authori- ties were chanting for weeks even as the International Nuclear  Event Scale ratcheted up to seven, and the unmistakable signa- ture of fission isotopes scattered across Japan and the Pacific,  and then North America and beyond.

For the Japanese, there was nothing there, nothing to be  “seen,” leaving them dependent on others (the same others,  that is, the same institutions that produced the threats) to de- termine the appropriate semiotic means (instrumentation) with  which to represent it back to them, and for them. Just signs, in  the wind.17 Quipped an Oregon dairy farmer a few weeks into the  event, “for the time being, we produce cheesium.” 18. Tsunami Japan. One of the world’s most nuclearized nations, a na- tion that in every conceivable way has internalized the atom,  attempted to master its traumatic history with the atom, as  producer, champion, as apologist, as perpetrator, and, as  victim, again.18 (I didn’t realize when I was working on Highway of the  Atom what a straight, strong,and strange line there is between  Japan’s victim past and its atomic present.) And, living as they do at the tectonic confluence poeti- cally known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, they are also one of the  world’s most-p repared nations for large seismic events. 69 </page> <page sequence="18"> 18. Bikini. Photograph by author. Yet the unimaginable arrived, predictably— the land  lurched into motion, matter feigning liquid; moments later, a  horrifying gesture of ocean— with a run- up height of over 120  feet in places— disavowed the land entirely; the black box of  containment of the reactors became (and perhaps remains)  transparent to their environments. A restive catfish and a feral dragon— the absolute repose  of the inorganic belongs not to the earth but only to death. 19. Field Note: Tsiigehtchic (Arctic Red River)— 6 August 2005 The Norweta, the Mackenzie river boat I have been travelling  on, arrives mid-d ay. Fourteen eagles sunning themselves at  the mouth of the river. I think it was fourteen (notwithstanding  Borges’ Argumentum Ornithologicum). I can find no fish being  smoked. No bales tied and waiting for transport to Aklavik (all  that Innis saw on his visit). It is hot. There is an inviting pond on  the large delta area at the confluence of the Red and Mackenzie  rivers. High above stands the village. Walking through town,  I stop and speak with an old woman who is standing near the  church. I ask her about swimming in this pond. “No,” she says,  and then tells me a long story. After one of the innumerable  battles between the Gwitch’in and the Inuit, scores of Inuit were  thrown into the lake, the wounded to drown, and all the bod- ies were just left in the lake. Ever since this time, she said, the  eagles wait for the bodies to rise, but all that emerge are ghosts.  The lake is full of ghosts, too full, so there is just no room to  swim. She uses a Slavey word to describe when this happened;  I think it means the really long- ago time. Too many ghosts. 70 </page> <page sequence="19"> 19. Radium Charles. Photograph by In the wake of their realization— as it appears to me, at  author. least— the Dene came to interpret their role in what seems to  me a most complex manner; that is, as both accomplice and  victim. One can see something of this in stories that have circu- lated in recent years. I paraphrase a story told by the late George Blondin that  references an ancient Dene prohibition about the very site of  Port Radium:19 The Dene had always known it was bad medicine to  travel in front of the area now known as Port Radium; it was  said that loud noises came from within it. For some reason a  group of Dene hunters had camped there, and in the morn- ing the medicine man told them of his dream in which he  saw white people going into a large hole in the ground with  machines. He saw boats on the lake and huge flying birds  loaded with things. They were making something long, like a  stick, which they dropped on people, burning everyone. This  was the future, he said, and it will happen long after we are  all dead.20 In counterpoint to the if only we had listened to what we  already knew tone of this story, another began circulating— a  kind of creation story— in which the genesis of the mine itself  was predicated on a theft of a pitchblende- bearing rock. In this  story it is Gilbert Labine— the main protagonist in white mining  mythology— who steals a rock by trickery from a Dene man  by the name of Bayonne. The rock unlocked the secret of the  radium and uranium, for which the Dene, of course, were never  compensated. Victim and accomplice. 71 </page> <page sequence="20"> To the former they sought recognition and compensation  from the government of Canada. Their land claim negotiations  were underway, and this needed to be a piece of accounting.21 But to the latter they disavowed the vortex of history and  archive, and also the vortical administrative discussions of  sovereignty, rights, and self- government, and moved directly  into the ethical. In 1998, on the anniversary of the bombings of  Nagasaki and Hiroshima, the Dene did something exemplary,  unthinkable: they organized a formal expedition to Japan to  make a call for peace and apologize to the hibakusha (the  bomb survivors) for their role: their labor, their complicity,  unknowing as it was, and foremost, their land— the territorial  archive that was now indelibly stained with the record of their  collusion. But more than all of the tragic details that came to light—  the stories of white and Dene children playing in sandboxes  filled with uranium mine tailing, discarded ore sacks used to  repair tents and clothing, the contaminated materials, the  accidents and spills— more than all of this, the apology on the  part of the Dene is incomprehensible, unfathomable.22 Taking  responsibility for an other. A singular work of cultural care. Of  mourning. What was being acted upon, insofar as I can comprehend  any of this, was a kind of imperative, an ethical imperative.  Perhaps it really is the case that the ethical and the traumatic  spring from the same place, from the same wound; for the  Dene, the historical trauma is invented in the same instant as  an ethical proceeding is undertaken.23 It’s complicated. The ar- chive ratified a memory of a trauma never experienced as such,  and the Dene saw in their own suffering an ethical inducement  toward a responsibility for the other. The mind reels; or mine  does. 20. Homonym Recently I was invited to attend and respond to a screening of  Into Eternity, Michael Madsen’s documentary. This film is about  a site in Finland where an extremely large underground storage  facility for high- level nuclear waste is being hewn into stable,  crystalline granite rock. The film— which falls perhaps a bit too much to the side of  aestheticizing the political— is a beautiful piece of Scandina- vian poetics: part Bergman, with the formal self- consciousness  of something one might identify as Jeff Wall. It tells the story of  the Finnish initiative to inter its commercial high- level nuclear  wastes on the island of Olkiluoto (ookal oh- tow)— adjacent to  the Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant. An amendment to the Na- tion’s Nuclear Energy Act in 1994 specified that “Nuclear waste  generated in connection with or as a result of use of nuclear  72 </page> <page sequence="21"> 20.

Photograph by author. energy in Finland shall be handled, stored, and permanently  disposed of in Finland.”24 Onkalo, they say, is a Finnish word for hiding place—  although in a more direct translation, it means cavity or cave.25  It is a massive, private- sector project that, when complete  around 2020, will, over a period of one hundred years, be filled  with thousands of specially designed copper canisters of highly  radioactive spent fuel. The site itself is now in the early phase of bedrock charac- terization. But if the correct constituencies and bodies can be  persuaded of the stability of the rock, and if it can obtain the  many licensing and permitting clearances it must receive, then  the final question will be is how it needs to be marked. What manner of sign is appropriate for a one- hundred-  thousand- year repository? A hiding place, almost sure to be forgotten, Onkalo— the  duration of its mandate— an order of magnitude beyond that  of the WIPP. 21. Keeping Place As Jonathan Bordo put it, Let me call a site of memory that in principle gives  dominance to living witnesses a “keeping place” and  thus distinguish it from all those depositories of memory  where preservation takes precedence over recollection—  museums, galleries, archives, and so on. . . . “Keeping  place” as a designation opens up the possibility for a  73 </page> <page sequence="22"> 21. Bunk house, Port Radium. NWT division between a heritage or generalized legacy, and  Archives/Bruce Hunter/N- 1998-015: a lieu de mémoire, requiring interested, engaged, and  0070. culturally specific custodian- witnesses . . . Such sites  are marked by a continuing contestation over custodian- ship between a hegemonic state- sanctioned practice of  memory that acts as if there are no living witnesses, and  practices of memory that acknowledge living witnesses  who claim these traces to be theirs to curate.26 Of course, this is it, isn’t it? The living witness, imperiled  through the practices themselves— the accident— through  a custodial practice (and public secret) that disavows any  witness, and through a pure temporality that makes the very  possibility of a living witness almost, but not quite, unfathom- able. Here we are dealing with telluric time, the time of the  biosphere. Madsen said, Even if the cave is never marked in any sense, it will be a  sign itself. The very construction will be a sign. Deep into  time, even the canisters will be gone, but there will still be  the scars in the bedrock. . . . The bedrock will still have this  hollow, spiral, triangular entry. There will be these sym- metrical deposits of high- level or radioactive material. . . .  So any creature in the future will understand that this has  been made. In this sense it will always be a sign.27 74 </page> <page sequence="23"> Well, yes and no. It is what Peirce would call a Firstness—  just a quality, not yet an index. An index in suspension. No  interpretant. The sign is in no relation with its object that could  reveal something to us. To anyone. Other than the assertion:  Here! An anthropomorphic trace. 22. Tennis Court, Port Radium. 22. Emphatic Geography Photograph by author. At Port Radium, there is an abandoned tennis court. It stands  atop the sheer granite cliffs right at the point where they  plunge into the blue unfathomable depths of Great Bear Lake.  This court, this ruin, is surfaced in a remarkable concrete  made from pulverized uranium mine tailings. It overlooks  another ruin: the decommissioned— that is, bulldozed and  abandoned— uranium mine. Homo ludens meets Homo faber.  It is difficult to convey the strangeness of standing there, listen- ing to a Geiger counter rendering sonorous the material history  of this place. Translating the abstract invisibility of energetic  matter seeking its own repose . . .28 An emphatic geography, as I would come to call it. 75 </page> <page sequence="24"> 23. Plaque, Port Radium. Photograph by author. 24. Whale, Port Radium. Photograph by author. 23. Recto Detail of the bronze plaque affixed to a five- foot concrete  marker at Port Radium. It tells the story of Gilbert Labine, the  radium discovery, the wartime switch to uranium, the bomb—   no mention of its purpose, no mention of Japan— its signifi- cance to the mining community and to the North. 24. Verso The other side of the monument contains two more bronze  plaques and one inscription— all interlopers. The first is a com- memorative plaque for John Zigarlick of Echo Bay Mines, who  reinvented Eldorado’s abandoned uranium mine as a high-  grade silver mine in 1963. Beneath this, incredibly, another plaque to Zigarlick’s wife,  “A true Northern Hostess” and a “Proud Northerner.” I have no idea what the third inscription is. It looks like a  whale. 25. Stones The Sanriku coastline of northeastern Japan has a particular  geomorphology that amplifies the tsunamis that regularly  engulf it. In 1896, a thirty- three- meter wave. Twenty-t hree meters in 1933. 869, 901, 1585, 1611, 1677, 1689, 1793, 1836, 1896  (Meiji 29), 1933 (Showa 8) And in 1993 a thirty- meter wave poured over Okushira  Island. Again and again. Then, March 2011. And yet, as if the wall of tsunami rocketing toward the coast  was not enough, the coastline itself— in a kind of elastic re- bound toward the epicenter— the coast itself sunk about three  76 </page> <page sequence="25"> 25. Hwy 62, New Mexico. Photograph feet, as though bowing toward the oncoming water, rendering  by author. the already modest tsunami defenses three feet lower. Within minutes of the second wave’s arrival— which eas- ily surmounted the thirty- three- foot seawall— the Fukushima  Daiichi plant was in a state of total station blackout. They were  literally in the dark. Twenty thousand people died that day, perhaps more.  More than this is speculation. The glow boys, jumpers, Fuku- shima 50, nuclear samurai, dose fodder, gamma sponges— all  the sacrificial cleanup labor at the nuclear plant— the eighty  thousand evacuees, the exclusion zone. The virtual body count  for what has become the most expensive “natural” disaster in  history— estimates vary but figures approaching $310 billion  are not uncommon. In the days and weeks following the tsunami, even as the  nuclear disaster eclipsed the coastal crisis, something remark- able happened. Survivors began to rediscover “gnarled stone tablets”—  I’m quoting Evan Osnos, here, from a piece in the New Yorker—  “Some of them hundreds of years old, which had been left  by . . . ancestors at precise points along the shore to indicate  the high-w ater marks of previous tsunamis. The inscriptions  implored future generations never to build closer to the water  again.”29 Writes Japanese poet Mariko Nagai: 77 </page> <page sequence="26"> The warning did come in time, but some did not remem- ber. The warning blared after the earthquake, the tsunami  warning that came out of nearly every village and town  hall, There is a tsunami warning, please evacuate to high  ground. This is a tsunami warning, please evacuate to  high ground. They were too used to it, too used to the  warnings that came nearly every year, the warning that did  not amount to anything more than a mere splash. Those  who did not heed the warning went back to retrieve their  memories, their past, what they deemed important . . . They did not remember that this coastline has been  plagued with the angry waves as long as written words have  existed, each devastation chiseled into stones. It is grief im- pressed upon the pages and stone tablets that dot the coast of  Sanriku area. It is regrets contained in these words, regrets that  translate into warnings for the future, for the present. But some  had forgotten. So instead, they went home, thinking they have  enough time.30 What is the threshold— the semiotic dosage— in the pres- ent, to ensure the transmission to the future? If you remind us  too much, we will not listen, and thus forget. And if you do not  remind us, there will have been nothing to listen to, and we  26.

With the thought of devastation of the great  tsunami, Remember never to build houses below this  marker. Both in Meiji 29 and Showa 8, the waves came to  this very point. And the entire village was destroyed; only  two survived in Meiji 29, and four in Showa 8. No matter  how many years may pass, do not forget this warning.31 Do not forget this warning. Another emphatic geography. Tsunami stones they are called. 26. Two Contrasting Markers 1. In Canada’s Northwest Territories, mining regulations specify  that, “Where, because of the presence of a body of water or any  other natural obstruction in an area . . . it is not practicable or  permitted to erect one of the four legal posts required by sub- section 14(1), a witness post shall be erected on each boundary  line . . . as near as possible to the place where the legal post  would otherwise have been erected.”32 2. In Japan, near the Anraku temple in Hiroshima, there is  a plaque to commemorate a Ginkgo tree survivor of the atomic  bomb. The tree itself is very old, grown from a cutting taken  78 </page> <page sequence="27"> from a twelfth-c entury tree at Zenpuku Temple in Tokyo. It  reads: “This Gingko withstood the atomic bombing on August  6th, 1945. There are still scorch marks on the upper part of the  trunk from the blast.”33 The temple, destroyed on that August  day, was rebuilt around the tree, to protect it. Witness post. A figure. An interesting thought. — Montréal, June 2012 Biography Peter C. van Wyck is professor of communication studies and Media Studies gradu- ate program director in the Department of Communication Studies at Concordia  University in Montréal. His academic formation is broadly interdisciplinary, with  training in forestry, ecological theory, philosophy, cultural studies, and environ- mental and communication theory. His abiding research interests are in the theo- retical and practical relations among culture, environment, landscape, and memory.  His two recent monographs— Signs of Danger: Waste, Trauma, and Nuclear Threat  (Minnesota, 2004), and Highway of the Atom (2010)— were both the recipient of the  Gertrude J. Robinson book award for the best new book in communication studies,  awarded annually by the Canadian Communication Association. Notes 1 Isabelle Stengers, The Invention of Modern Science, trans.

These have  all been made in a religious context. But Onkalo is purely, sort of profane, there are  no such concerns involved in the facility.
