<plain_text><page sequence="1">Timothy O. Benson: Raoul Hausmann and Berlin Dada. Ann Arbor, Michigan: UMI Research Press, 1987. 280 pages. From «Dadasein» to «Dada-merika,» the provocative and emancipatory potential of Dada continues to fascinate the imagination. Whereas the self-referentiality of such slogans (actually, titles of art works) illustrates what was recognized at the time as «the aggressive power and propagandist«: force of the word» (r 68), it was in the visual arts rather than the verbal - or in a combination of the two - that Dada achieved its greatest effects. Benson, himself an art historian, investigates the early history of concrete art forms between 1915 and 1920, with particular focus on Dadaism in Berlin and its primary exponent, Raoul Hausmann. The book gives only cursory considera tion to the seminal Zurich movement, which is unfortunate since Dada was an avowedly international phenomenon with repercussions also in Paris and New York as well as in Hanover and Cologne. But within the Berlin setting Benson offers a straightforward account, precise analyses, and brief but insightful interpretations, all in marked contrast to writers on Dada who exuberantly imitate the object of analysis.</page><page sequence="2">248 Besprechungen/Reviews 95 black-and-white illustrations of art works provide the basis for his commentary, and numerous quotations (all rendered in English) from manifestos and journals of the period furnish documentation. That the goal of the Dadaists was not only to shock bourgeois sensibilities but also to promote social change is evident from the theoretical writings of Hausmann and others, as outlined in Benson's introduction and throughout. Although the Dadaists noisily renounced the spirituality and the abstraction of the Expressionists, they also, in this view, yearned for unity and wholeness, and they thus rebuilt an eclectic myth of the New Man and Utopian egalitarian community. This secular mysticism of «cosmic consciousness,» as the author terms it, rejected the anthropomorphic perspective of man as the center and with it the notion of emotional empathy and aesthetic aura, replacing it with a view of culture in its purely concrete, that is, material existence. The «new materiality» did not entail endorsement of philosophical mate rialism but was regarded rather as a means for concretizing the tensions and exposing the contradictions of materialistic, militaristic society and its sham ideals. In pursuit of synthesis the Dadaists cherished contradiction, and Benson wisely makes no attempt to resolve the paradoxes but simply presents them in their full array. Dadaism in Berlin is seen to have begun in 1917 when Richard Huelsenbeck came to the city from Zurich. Hausmann was the theorist, the «Dadasoph,» of the group which included also Johannes Baader, Hannah Hoch, George Grosz, John Heartfield (pseudonym for Herzfelde), and others. Benson points out the difficulty in distin guishing between individual and collaborative achievement, and he also discusses the borrowings and appropriations as well as the innovations and inventions in the artists' search for new forms and unique materials. Hausmann's development from 1910 to 1924 is the red thread, and the author traces his evolution from woodcut, lithography, typography, and optophonetic poetry to collage and particularly the Klebebilder (glued overlay) and Plastik (assemblage). The major contribution of Berlin Dada is seen in the photomontage, as developed by Hausmann and others between 1918 and 1920; by using the photograph as raw material together with other visual and verbal compositional elements they sought to create «an explosion of viewpoints and jumbled pictorial planes» (182). Irony, parody, and satire were the prime weapons in this critique of culture, and the carnivalization expressed itself also in cabaret, happenings, and various types of performance art. The climactic exhibition took place in 1920, after which Dadaism dissolved and Hausmann turned to what he called the «new optics» and Constructivism. Thus Benson presents a sympathetic, yet critical history of the anarchistic anti-art movement, and he also suggests reasons for its currency at the time and thenceforth. Dadaism, he finds, sought a dialogue with vernacular culture on its own terms by incorporating aspects from the domains of fashion, the cinema, advertising, techno logy, and everyday life in urban, industrial society. In doing so the artists sought to expose the arbitrary and contradictory nature of conventional values through wit, humor, and ridicule, for which no target was sacred; but the method behind the madness was to allow for the shaping of new cognitive structures beyond the morass to which «humanism» had or has led. Benson provides an important philosophical</page><page sequence="3">Besprechungen/Reviews 249 dimension to what is often dismissed as merely superficial, outrageous protest, and the book offers a stimulating retrospective on the course of twentieth-century culture.
