<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 3  A Synecdoche  The three metaphors of Russian Formalist theory, decisive as  they were in their proponents' thinking, still do not account for  perhaps the most fundamental Formalist conception : the notion  of language as the material of poetry. "Insofar as the material of  poetry is the word,"  Zirmunskij wrote, "the classification of ver­ bal phenomena provided by linguistics should be the basis for a  systematically constructed poetics. Because the artistic goal  transforms each of these phenomena into a poetic device, every  chapter of theoretical poetics should correspond to a chapter  from the science of language. " 1 Language thus generated a  fourth Formalist model. But the trope underlying it was not a  metaphor, as in the cases of the mechanistic, morphological , and  systemic models. These posited a similarity between the literary  work and a machine, organism, and hierarchical system, respec­ tively, but the model described by Zirmunskij is a synecdoche, a  pars pro toto relationship. It substitutes language-the material of  verbal art-for art itself, and linguistics-the science of lan­ guage-for literary studies.  The linguistic model , as this theoretical synecdoche might be  termed, has its roots in the early Formalist preoccupation with  1 .

The importance of this notion for the entire  Formalist enterprise cannot be overstated . Pavel Medvedev, a  Marxist critic of the movement, quite correctly claimed that the  "hypothesis of the distinctness of poetic language is the basis  upon which the entire Russian Formalist method is built. "2 The  Formalists themselves were aware of the privileged status of this  concept. Indignant at the label of "Formalism" foisted upon  them, these young literary scholars proudly presented them­ selves as students of poetic language and even as linguists . The  names of their two original groups, the Society for the Study of  Poetic Language and the Moscow Linguistic Circle, and the title  of their first two collective publications, Studies in the Theory of  Poetic Language, clearly indicate the image they strove to project  at the inception of the movement. 3  The acceptance of any concept among the whole Formalist  membership was never a simple matter and "poetic language"  was no exception. Because of the inherent heterogeneity of the  movement and the fluidity of its concepts over time, the For­ malists never reached a general definition of either poetic lan­ guage or the linguistic frame of reference for its description.  Moreover, as Formalist theorizing unfolded, the fortunes of the  linguistic model in general and the notion of poetic language in  particular fluctuated widely. OPOJAZ's initial infatuation with  the two gave way to a sharp backlash in the early twenties. But  just as the stock of the linguistic model was dipping in Pe­ tersburg, it was rising in Moscow. Obviously, the idea of a single  theoretical synecdoche in Russian Formalism is an oversimplifi­ cation. In fact, this fourth model encompasses several distinct  theories, each of which treated literature as the art of language  and used methods borrowed from linguistics. In the discussion  that follows, I shall attempt to describe some of the most impor­ tant currents among them.  2 .

Wishing to portray the incomprehensibility , the  illogicality of life and its terror or mystery, they  resort (as ever, as always ! )  to "clear, precise" com­ mon language. [ . . . ]  We were the first to say that for portraying the  new and the future completely new words and new  combinations are necessary.  This striking newness will come through the com­ bination of words according to their own immanent  laws revealed to the poet and not according to the  rules of logic or grammar, as has been the case  before us.  -ALEKSEJ KRUCENYCH,   "The New Paths of  the Word"  "Poetic language" was already a loaded term by the time it  entered Formalist discourse . Aleksandr Potebnja ( 1 835- 1 89 1 ) ,  the heir to the tradition of Humboldtian linguistics , was the first  to introduce the distinction between poetic and prosaic language  into Russian philology.4 The Formalists' attitude toward their  4.

Stempel (Munich, 1 972 ) ,  p. xiv.  </page> <page sequence="4"> A Synecdoche  "precursor" was rather ambivalent, however. Their willingness  to borrow from him implied a respect extended to no other  nineteenth-century Russian philologist but Veselovskij .  Still they  criticized Potebnja's work violently in order to differentiate them­ selves from him, and especially from his numerous epigones.  The Symbolist literary critic D. Filosofov, the first reviewer of  OPOJAZ's 1 9 1 6  collective publication, described this dialectic  relationship : "All the contributors to this new collection are in a  sense Potebnja's pupils. They know him by heart ; they live off  the late scholar's ideas . But they are not arrested in them. They  reexamine the mysterious correlations of sound and representa­ tion and in doing so they focus their entire attention on sound.  But in the end they make clear that sound, even 'nonarticulated'  sound, generates representation. They speak of the magic of  sound, the magic of words."5  The Formalist departure from Potebnja should not be viewed  merely as a struggle for recognition. Though a powerful and  prolific thinker, Potebnja was often more suggestive than clear,  and in his elaborate handling of topics he often multiplied the  definitions of even his most cherished concepts . The opposition  between prosaic and poetic language is a case in point. Some­ times it is presented as a simple formal dichotomy between prose  and poetry, and at others , as a psychological antinomy between  prosaic and poetic thought. In the latter case, the presence of a  mental image is the essential feature of the poetic, and "poetic  thinking" is defined as "thinking in which the image is impor­ tant. "6 When the distinction is made on formal grounds, the  differential feature is a matter of function ; prose is thus "lan­ guage oriented solely toward practical aims or serving as an  expression of scholarship."7  Despite these inconsistencies, Potebnja'� poetics did rest on  certain basic assumptions. The word and/or poetic work consists  of three parts : the outer form (the perceptible aspect) , the  5 .  "Magija slov," Rel' , no. 265 (September 26, 1 9 1 6) ,  3 .   6 .

Ibid . ,  p. 102 .   </page> <page sequence="5"> Russian Formalism  meaning (the intelligible aspect) , and the inner form or repre­ sentation (the tropological link between the two) .  The crucial  member of this triad is inner form, a notion heavily dependent  upon certain ideas from psychology. In agreement with the  atomistic theory of association so popular in his time, Potebnja  treated mental life as an aggregate of simple sensory elements .  For him, the perceptual identity of an object (what he termed its  "image") was guaranteed by the persistence of a simple charac­ teristic through whatever contextual modification the object un­ dergoes. Language follows this model when a distinctive charac­ teristic motivates an object's designation, that is, when the object  is named according to this feature. But though thought and  language coincide here, this is not a case of inner form proper.  Only a single sensory image has provided the link between the  outer form and meaning, whereas the inner form is an umbrella  for a multitude of such images ; in Potebnja's words ,  "it is not an  image of an object but an image of an image, that is, a represen­ tation."8  As a metaconcept, inner form is endowed with the power that  a single image lacks : it links outer forms and meanings that were  originally connected to diverse sensory images. In this respect,  the inner form of language is the crossroads of the old and the  new. As the "nearest etymological meaning of a word,"  it stands  for the linguistic past, but as the tertium comparationis that gener­ ates the figurative transformations of a word, it is the agent of  the future .9 Because of this creative potential , the inner lin­ guistic form became the central category of Potebnja's poetics.  Without denying salience to the other two components of the  word, Potebnja found the eidos of poetic language in its poly­ semy, the capacity of its inner form to evoke multiple meanings .  Stated in quasi-mathematical terms, "the general formula of po­ etry (or art) is : 'A ( image) &lt; X (meaning)' ;  that is, there is always  an inequality between image and meaning because A is smaller  8.

To establish an equality between A and X would destroy  poeticity ; i .e . ,  it would either turn the image into a prosaic sig­ nification of a particular phenomenon devoid of relation to any­ thing else or it would turn the image into a scientific fact and the  meaning into a law." 1 0  The Formalist redefinition of poetic language represents a  considerable departure from Potebnja's basic position. This de­ parture, however, was not solely motivated by theoretical con­ cerns but also by the current poetic practice. Some of the early  Formalists entered the Russian intellectual scene not as disin­ terested observers or commentators , but as proponents and in­ terpreters of Futurism, the most flamboyant artistic movement  of their generation. The rise of Futurism in the early teens was  directly linked to the decline of another movement that had  dominated Russian letters for nearly two decades-Symbolism.  The great poet-theoreticians of this movement had exploited  Potebnja's philology as the theoretical springboard for their own  poetics. In Roman Jakobson's words, "the Symbolists canonized  Potebnja ." 1 1  Thus, the Futurist onslaught against Symbolism in­ volved at the same time a "de-canonization" of Potebnja, a  search for new theoretical foundations upon which to construct  their poetics.  Of the various groups in Russia calling themselves Furturists ,  the most iconoclastic was known as H ylaea, and it was with this  group that the Formalists were most closely allied, both person­ ally and in terms of a shared artistic sensibility. Hylaea's mem­ bership included the Burljuk brothers , Chlebnikov, Krucenych,  and Majakovskij . In the unceasing stream of public appearances,  manifestos, and joint publications, all orchestrated to epater les  bourgeois, the Hylaeans declared the art of the past dead and  presented themselves as the only true champions of the artistic  future. Their incompatibility with Potebnja's system is obvious at  first glance. Disdaining the cognitive function of art ( "thinking  1 0. Iz zapisok, p. 1 00.  1 1 .

Artworks,  according to Chlebnikov and Krucenych, ought to be "as if writ­ ten with difficulty and read with difficulty, less comfortable than  blacked boots or a truck in a sitting room," their language "re­ sembling if anything a saw or a savage's poisoned arrow." 1 2  Against the historicism of Potebnja's poetic word (that is, its  etymological meaning) , the Hylaeans' manifesto ,  "A Slap in the  Face of Public Taste, "  proclaimed the poet's right to an "in­ superable hatred for the language that existed before him." 1 3  They ridiculed the entire psychologistic bias of the previous  poetics . Poetry, they insisted, is not a mirror of the soul but "the  unfolding of the word as such. "  Or in more epigrammatic form,  "The work of art is the art of the word. " 14  This conception of verbal art was obviously reflected in the  earliest, mechanistic model. Key notions such as de-familiariza­ tion or the absolute split between art and byt are direct projec­ tions of Futurist poetics onto Formalist literary theory. The no­ tion of poetic language was most profoundly influenced by the  Futurist concept of zaum' .  Coined by Krucenych, the term desig­ nated a special tongue that defied the rules of common sense :  transrational language . Zaum' attacked the very heart of Poteb­ nja's aesthetic system-the identification of poeticity with the in­ ner form of language, since this "ultimate" language of verbal  art was without inner form. Its two main exponents among the  Hylaeans, Krucenych and Chlebnikov, disagreed about which of  the remaining parts of the verbal parcel--outer form or mean­ ing-was instrumental in zaum' . As Vladimir Markov has ob­ served, "for Krucenych [zaum' ] was a free, but often emotionally  expressive , combination of sound, devoid of full meaning; for  Chlebnikov, it was basic meaning expressed in the purest and  most direct way ." 1 5  1 2 .

"A new content,"  he proclaimed , "is born only when new  expressive devices , new forms, are achieved. Once there is a new  form, the new content follows. Thus, the form determines the  content. " 1 6  Consequently, it was not the ideas or things present­ ed by the literary work that were important, but the mechanism  of this presentation itself. Because this mechanism is above all  linguistic, Krucenych spoke of two types of language : rational  common language governed by extralinguistic requirements, a ve­ hicle of meaning; and self-sufficient transrational language gov­ erned by its own rules , "whose words do not have a definite  meaning. " 1 7   This indefiniteness o f  meaning in zaum' is quite different  from Potebnja's poetic polysemy. The quantitative imbalance  occurs not between the inner form of the word and its meaning,  but between the meaning and the word as such, that is, its outer  form. Moreover, transrational language reverses the ratio of  Potebnja's formula : in zaum' sound always is greater than mean­ ing. Krucenych wrote, "We declared in art : THE WORD IS  BROADER THAN ITS MEANING. The word (and the sounds  composing it) is not merely curtailed thought, not merely logic ,  but above all the transrational (its mystical and aesthetic compo­ ;  I nents) . "  1 8  Hence, transrational language is literally language  I that goes beyond reason,  that addresses the nonrational human faculties . To achieve this objective, the poet is free to dissolve l   t language into elements that lack any logical meaning, or to com­bine these elements into nonsensical neologisms. The poet can  i also emulate the types of zaum' existing outside verbal art. One  I especialiy favored by Krucenych was the glossolalia of religious  l sectarians speaking the "language of the holy spirit . "  There was  }  1 6.

To those familiar with the  impenetrable hermeticism of Chlebnikov's texts, this might  come as a surprise . But understanding was never an issue for  him. "Verses," he wrote, "may be comprehensible or incompre­ hensible, but they ought to be good, ought to be truthful [istoven­ nyj] . "2 1 To be transrational for Chlebnikov meant to go beyond  ordinary reason,  but only to express the higher reason that he  believed language inevitably embodied. Potebnja's notion of in­ ner form was thus suspect, for it posited merely a figurative link  between sound and meaning. Chlebnikov's zaum', in contrast,  was a quest for the direct, unmediated meaning of sound.  In his study of Chlebnikovian zaum', Ronald Vroon has identi­ fied four such linguistic structures :  the languages of the "stars ,"   "Gods," and "birds," and "sound-painting." He maintains that  each of these tackles the issue of pure meaning in a different  way.22  For instance, the "language of the stars"-Chlebnikov's  favorite-is based on the same kind of argument for the natural  origin of names that Plato credits to Cratylus .  It assigns a distinct  spatiogeometric meaning to virtually all Russian consonants.  This zaum', Chlebnikov believed, was not an arbitrary construc­ tion but a faithful reconstruction of the original language of  mankind, of which our present-day tongues are mere shadows .  In rough terms, the rift between Krucenych and Chlebnikov  over zaum' corresponds to the conflicting theories of poetic lan­ guage in the Formalist movement. OPOJAZ's early concern for  poetic sound and its emotive qualities betrays Krucenych's influ- i 9. According to the title page and a note inside, Krucenych's i 9 1 3  collection  Piglets (Porosjata) was coauthored by an eleven-year-old, Zina V.  20.

We shall now look more closely at the earlier  of these two tendencies , those of OPOJAZ.  In 1 9 1 6, Viktor Sklovskij undertook the first direct critique of  Potebaja's poetics. "Imagery, or symbolism," he insisted , "is not  what differentiates poetic from prosaic language. Poetic lan­ guage differs from prosaic language in the perceptibility of its  structure ."23 Sklovskij's strategy here is quite obvious :  he is re­ vising Potebnja's dichotomy between poetic and prosaic lan­ guage according to the specifications of his mechanistic model.  The special perceptibility of poetic language drains our mental  energy and de-familiarizes our perception of language in gener­ al. This essential feature of poetic language is explained by its  artistic telos. "If we study poetic speech . . . w e encounter the  same symptom of the artistic everywhere : that it was created  intentionally to de-automatize perception and that the author's  goal was to call attention to this ; that it was made 'artificially' in  such a way that perception lingers over it, thus reaching its  greatest possible intensity and duration." The direct opposite of  this "hampered and tortuous" speech is automatized prosaic lan­ guage. "Prose is normal speech: economical , easy, regular (the  dea prorsa is the goddess of regular, uncomplicated delivery) . "24  It is significant that while Sklovskij's treatment of poetic lan­ guage rejects Potebnja's, it retains his fundamental dichotomy of  poetic and prosaic language. Here we witness yet another exam­ ple of the peculiar contradiction in the mechanistic model men­ tioned earlier ; namely, its propensity for merging the most radi­ cal stance with a traditional conceptual framework. This mar­ riage of the old and the new tends to generate problems. The  opposition between poetry and prose would appear to coincide  with Sklovskij's distinction between art and byt. But if this were  the case, poetic speech, with its patent goal of de-familiarization,  23 .  "Potebnja," Poetika: Sborniki po teorii poetileskogo jazyka (Petersburg, 1 9 1 9) ,   P· 4 ·   24. "Iskusstvo, kak priem," ibid . ,  pp. 1 1 2- 1 3 .  14 7   </page> <page sequence="11"> Russian Formalism  would be the only discourse to use language purposively, and  prosaic speech, as a phenomenon of byt, would be governed  purely by causality. As Sklovskij himself showed, "economical,  easy, and regular" speech might also be used for the sake of de­ familiarization .  This is the case of artistic prose that renders  extraliterary reality strange in the process of its verbal represen­ tation. In this way, one is forced to speak of not two but three  types of language : the poetic , which makes strange our percep­ tion of language itself, the prosaic-artistic , which does the same  to the perception of reality, and the prosaic proper, that is,  normal everyday language. Yet according to the logic of Sklov­ skij 's model, the first two types are clearly different from the  third . Whereas the two differ in what they de-familiarize, they  are united through their common artistic goal. Normal everyday  language, in contrast, belongs to byt. This fact, however, is com­ pletely lost in the simple opposition of prose and poetry that  Sklovskij inherited from Potebnja. Thus, it was necessary to  readjust Potebnja's original opposition in such a way that the line  between literature and nonliterature would be drawn more  clearly .  This task was performed by another OPOJAZ member, the  linguist Lev Jakubinskij , who was responsible for introducing  the distinction between poetic and practical language into liter­ ary theory. In linguistics , Jakubinskij argued, the opposition be­ tween the teleological and the causal can be suspended, because  every utterance, whether poetic or not, pursues some objective.  From this perspective, language can be conceptualized as a  means-end structure serving particular goals. This view of lan­ guage is similar to the functional classification of linguistic  sounds advanced by the Kazan ' School to which Jakubinskij 's  teacher, Baudoin de Courtenay ( 1 845- 1 929) ,  belonged.25 It is  also parallel to the thesis propounded by Franz Brentano's fol- 25. Cf. , for example, R. Jakobson, "The Kazan' School of Polish Linguistics  and Its Place in the International Development of Phonology," Selected Writings,  vol. 2 (The Hague, 1 97 1 ) , p. 399; and "Efforts toward a Means-Ends Model of  Language in Interwar Continental Linguistics ," ibid . ,  p. 524.   </page> <page sequence="12"> A Synecdoche  lower, the philosopher Anton Marty ( 1 847- 1 9 1 4) ,  concerning  the teleological origin of language as a means of human commu­ nication. Jakubinskij , however, avoided the psychologism of  Marty's teleology, which treated intention in terms of a con­ scious subject. For Jakubinskij , it was not the subjective inten­ tions of the speaker but the objective correlation of linguistic  means and ends that distinguished poetic from practical lan­ guage.  "Linguistic phenomena," Jakubinskij argued, "should be clas­ sified, among other ways, from the standpoint of the goal for  which the speaker exploits the verbal material in a given case. If   he uses i t  for the purely practical goal of communication, we are  dealing with the system of practical language, in which linguistic  representations (sounds, morphemes, etc . )  have no value in  themselves but serve merely as a means of communication. Other  linguistic systems are conceivable (and exist) in which the prac­ tical goal retreats into the background and linguistic combina­ tions acquire a value in themselves. . . . I conditionally call this  system verse [stichotvornyj] language."26  Jakubinskij's distinction between language as a means of com­ munication and language as a self-valuable end should remind  us of Krucenych's distinction between common language and  zaum' . This parallel becomes even more pronounced when jak­ ubinskij goes on to discuss the difference between practical and  poetic language in terms of the opposition between sound and  meaning. "In practical language the semantic aspect of the word  (its meaning) is more prominent than its sound aspect . . . .  de­ tails of pronunciation reach our consciousness only if they serve  to differentiate the meaning of words . . . . T hus, various consid­ erations compel us to recognize that in practical language sounds  26. "O zvukach stichotvornogo jazyka," Poetika, p. 37 .  It is important to stress  that Jakubinskij himself conceived of "verse language" simply as a "special case  of poetic language" ( "Skoplenie odinakovych plavnych v prakticeskom i poet­ iceskom jazykach," ibid . ,  p. 54). As I shall show later, this seemingly subtle  difference developed into an important argument against the entire linguistic  model.  r49  l  t  </page> <page sequence="13"> Russian Formalism  do not attract our attention. It is the other way around in verse  language. There, one can claim that sounds enter the bright  field of consciousness and do attract our attention. "27  This foregrounding of sound profoundly affects the structure  of poetic language . Krucenych's statement that zaum' combines  words "according to their immanent laws . . . a nd not according  to the rules of logic and grammar" is relevant. Jakubinskij too  claims that poetic and practical language are demarcated by an­ tithetical combinatory laws. He states that the liquid consonants  (r, l) tend to cluster in poetic language, whereas in practical  language they are almost always randomly dispersed. If in prac­ tical language adjacent syllables contain the same liquid, this  consonant will either be dropped altogether in one of them or  replaced by another liquid . For the "clustering of the same liqui­ ds impedes pronunciation (even causing stammering) and violates  the usual tempo of speech, thus willy-nilly directing the attention of  the speaker toward the phonic aspect of the utterance . . . .  [ I t]  violates the automatism which is so essential to practical lan­ guage. "28 Poetic language, on the other hand, which aims at  focusing attention on sounds themselves, not only tolerates the  clustering of the same liquids but deliberately produces such  clusters.  Jakubinskij 's equation of poetic language with zaum' goes even  further. In his 1 92 1 essay, "Where Does Verse Come From?" he  argues that the concern for the sound of an utterance to the  neglect of its content links poetic language to other types of  discourse that defy normal reason. For example, "first of all , [in]  the dream . . . t he association of words according to their sound  may determine the dream content. Second, in mental illness some  patients utter entire tirades that are relatively unconnected in  their content (as they ought to be) yet obviously linked in their  sound, and often in meter. Third, in states of ecstasy, for instance  among religious sectarians," utterances often contain "sound  27. "O zvukach stichotvornogo jazyka," p. 38.  28. "Skoplenie odinakovych plavnych," p. 52 .   150  </page> <page sequence="14"> A Synecdoche  repetition and meter. "29 In a rather startling move, Jakubinskij  invoked Freud's authority to claim that verse as well as the other  three kinds of abnormal language are in fact the first stage of  infantile language emerging from the subconscious in moments  of weakened rational control. Thus, he answers the question  raised in the title of his article by claiming that "verse comes  from infantile babble,"  providing a psychoanalytic explanation  for Krucenych's transrational language.   Jakubinskij was not the only Formalist to conceive of poetic  language as a particular manifestation of zaum', though the oth­ ers usually did not invoke a psychoanalytic frame of reference.  Not surprisingly, Viktor Sklovskij was one of the most powerful  voices advocating the exclusion of semantics from verbal art.  "We must ask," he wrote, "whether words have meaning even in  language that is not overtly transrational but simply poetic, or  whether this belief is a mere fiction-the result of our inatten­ tiveness ."30 In a speech to the Futurists at the Stray Dog, a  Petersburg cabaret, Sklovskij spoke of transrational experiments  in terms borrowed from Potebnja and the Symbolists. He com­ pared zaum', for example, to the foreign languages used in litur­ gical services .  "The religious poetry of almost all nations was  written in such a semiunderstandable language : Church Slav­ onic, Latin , Sumerian (which died out in the twentieth century  B.c.  but was used as a religious language until the third century) ,  and the German of the Russian Pietists [stundisty] . "3 1  Later  Sklovskij dropped such "metaphysical" explanations and pre­ ferred to speak instead of the "sweetness of verse on our lips ,"   the de-automatized movement of our speech organs producing  unusual phonic patterns.32 "Maybe," he mused, "the greatest  part of the pleasure caused by poetry lies in its articulatory as­ pect, in the peculiar dance of the speech organs ."33  29 .

Once  poetic language is purged of meaning, verbal art can quite con­ veniently be described in terms of another nonthematic art. Mu­ sic-the art of pure sound-is an obvious parallel ; that is, if  literature is nothing but a striking organization of phonic mate­ rial , the poetic text is very much like a musical composition. Osip  Brik, another contributor to the early OPOJAZ collections, de­ clared that "poetic language is musical language" and attempted  to describe a major principle of the phonic organization of verse  that had so far escaped the attention of other investigators . 34  Brik proceeded from the same assumption as Jakubinskij ,  namely, that poetic utterances are composed according to cer­ tain combinatory rules that are phonic in nature. For Jak­ ubinskij , this was the clustering of liquids, but Brik went beyond  this in two respects. First of all, he did not stop with liquids ,  but  included all the consonants . Second and more important, he was  not interested merely in isolated consonantal patterns but in the  reiteration of these patterns throughout the poetic text .  Tradi­ tional literary studies, according to Brik, merely paid lip service  to the phonic aspect of poetic language and recorded only the  most obvious cases of speech sound repetition : rhyme, asso­ nance, alliteration ,  onomatopoeia. But these are merely an "ob­ vious manifestation, a special case of fundamental euphonic  laws ,"  and there are other cases that follow these laws but remain  unnoticed. 35 Brik's essay studied one of these-the recurrence  of consonantal patterns-as it appeared, for example, in this  Puskin line :  Vezuvij zev otkryl . . .   (Vesuvius opened its gorge)36  Brik termed this type of consonantal reiteration "sound repeti­ tion" and attempted not only to provide a typology of such repe- 34.

Using literally hundreds of  lines from Puskin and Lermontov Brik demonstrated that sound  repetition permeates even the most canonical of Russian poetry.  Another contributor to the early OPOJAZ volumes, Boris  Kusner, argued that the treatment of poetic language in terms  of the other arts, for example , dance and music, is natural be­ cause their materials have something in common. They are tem­ poral rather than spatial media. "But," Kusner warns, "despite  their shared sound material, one can speak of verse music only  metonymically. Here the term music no longer signifies a given  art but the basic material of its works-sound."37 This figure of  speech is therefore not productive for poetics, Kuiiner argues,  for musical and poetic sounds are incompatible phenomena.  The former are tones (toniruju5lie zvuki) , sounds correlated ac­ cording to precise scales and intervals ,  whereas the latter are  merely sonorous sounds (soniruju5lie zvuki) whose actual phonic  values are largely arbitrary. Music and poetry can, however, be  related metaphorically, through the similarity of their artistic  forms, that is, the precisely calculated organization of sound  material. These "sonorous chords"-the repetitions of particu­ lar sounds and their groups in a poetic work-are what Kuiiner  sets out to study.  But how do Kusner's "sonorous chords" differ from Brik's  "sound repetitions"? First of all, in the way they are described :  Brik presents his repetitions as objective phonic structures,  whereas Kuiiner is concerned with the constitution of the  "chords" in the perceiver's consciousness. Second, Brik's treat­ ment of the poetic sound stratum is quite atomistic : he deals with  a couple of isolated lines each time. For Kuiiner, on the other  hand, the "sonorous chords" are the property of an entire  poem. Of all the factors that create a rhythmical impression on  the perceiver ,  Kusner focuses on two : the articulation of speech  37. "O zvukovoj storone poetieeskoj reCi," Sbomiki po teorii poeticeskogo jazyka,  vol. I ,  P· 43·   153  </page> <page sequence="17"> Russian Formalism  into syllables , and the segmentation of the continuous utterance  into verse lines. In this way each speech sound is assigned a  precise place within a two-dimensional grid based on its position  vis-a-vis the other syllables of the line and vis-a-vis correspond­ ing syllables in other lines. The resulting grid of verse positions  accounts for the distribution of all speech sounds in the poetic  text, thus enabling Kusner to detect any patterns that they might  form-the sonorous chords.  The Formalists discussed so far tackled the category of poetic  language as a primarily phonic phenomenon. Their preoccupa­ tion with poetic sound was chiefly inspired by Krucenych's con­ cept of zaum' -language contemptuous of everyday rationality  and semantics. It must be stressed that even though Krucenych  scoffed at language that merely conveys thought, he conceived  of transrational language as something more than mere sound.  The unfolding of the "self-valuable word" was only one aspect  of zaum' , for the destruction of syntax and grammar still served  a particular objective . A normally structured utterance , Kru­ cenych reasoned, contains a logical meaning that transmits  thought into words. The deformed zaum',  on the other hand,  lacks such a definite meaning, but precisely because of this its  words can express directly the noncognitive components of the  poet's consciousness . "The clear and decisive evidence for the  fact that until now the word has been in shackles is its subordina­ tion to sense. Until now it has been maintained that 'thought  dictates laws to the word and not the other way around. '  We  have pointed out this mistake and provided a free language,  transrational and ecumenical . The path of previous artists led  through thought to the word ; ours leads through the word to  direct apprehension. "38  Krucenych,  however, failed to explain in any cogent way ei­ ther the mechanism for this immediate apprehension or its ob­ ject. His point might be expected to carry rhetorical weight with­ in a poetic manifesto but certainly not elsewhere . Yet it caught  38. "Novye puti slova," pp. 65-66.  154  </page> <page sequence="18"> A Synecdoche  the fancy of the Formalists, who argued against Potebnja's iden­ tification of poetic language with inner linguistic form. From  their point of view, Krucenych's zaum' was the best evidence that  verbal art can do quite well without any images. To sustain this  argument they had to translate Krucenych's statements about  the direct expressivity of outer poetic form into more scholarly  terms.  Here they could turn to a theory of another member of the  Kazan' School , Mikolaj Kruszewski ( 1 85 1 - 1 887) .  In studying  the universal laws of association operating in language, Krus­ zewski had argued that "the coexistence of the two aspects of the  word-its external appearance and its meaning-rests on an as­ sociation based on contiguity which binds these two aspects ' into  an inseparable pair. '  But to our memory 'such a binding seems  weak and insufficient ;  it must be supported by an association to  another word based on similarity . ' " This dual linkage of each  verbal unit is the engine that drives linguistic change.  Kruszewski depicts the process of linguistic evolution as "an  eternal antagonism between a progressive force determined by  associations based on similarity and a conservative one deter­ mined by associations based on contiguity. "39  Kruszewski's two types of association correspond in turn to  two figures of speech : metaphor and metonymy. The ingenious  Sklovskij used this tropological distinction in attacking Potebnja.   He claimed that not only poetic but prosaic language might  involve inner linguistic form, that is, the figurative transference  of meaning. But it is necessary to distinguish between two differ­ ent figures of speech : the "conservative" metonymy, based on  contiguity, and the "progressive" metaphor, based on sim­ ilarity. Given the bias of Sklovskian aesthetics toward novelty in  art it is not surprising that he considered the metaphor as the  only truly poetic trope. Metonymy is merely the "practical  means of thinking, of conceptualizing objects" and as such it  39. R. Jakobson, "Znacenie Krusevskogo v razvitii nauki o jazyke," Selected  Writings, vol . 2 , pp. 436-37 .   IJJ  </page> <page sequence="19"> Russian Formalism  characterizes prosaic language, but metaphor is the "means for  intensifying perception" and hence the essence of poetic lan­ guage. To illustrate, calling someone "a hat" simply because he  happens to wear one is to evoke a prosaic image-trope, whereas  the same designation for a helpless, languid fellow would be a  poetic figure. 40  Despite Sklovskij 's criticism, however, he was still operating  with Potebnja's concept of inner form. The metaphoric designa­ tion that he described involved a cognitive tertium comparationis­ a mental construct linking the outer form of the word with its  figurative meaning, as in "helplessness" and "sloppiness" in his  "hat" example. But the Formalists inspired by Krucenych's  zaum' were not much concerned with traditional poetic tropes.  Rather, they looked for cases of what Roman Jakobson aptly  termed "negative inner form," that is, "words which so to speak  seek their meaning," or, put differently , words with a directly  expressive outer form.4 1  One hypothesis about the immediate emotive value of poetic  sound was enunciated by Lev Jakubinskij . He approvingly  quoted the observation of the famous French Indo-Europeanist  Antoine Meillet ( 1 866- 1 936) that in "practical language there is  no inner link between the sound of the words and their meanings.  Their link is determined by an association based on contiguity and is  factual, not natural . "42 This is so because in practical language ·.  sounds merely serve to differentiate meaning. The foreground­ ing of sound that is proper to poetic language, however, changes  the picture . In such language, "because our attention is attracted  by sounds, an emotive attitude is aroused toward them. This  circumstance," Jakubinskij stressed, "is very important for deter­ mining the interrelations of the phonic and semantic aspects of  speech in verse language. "43 Here the two are linked by the  relation of similarity . Jakubinskij's notion of similarity is, howev- 40. "Iskusstvo, kak priem," p. 103 .   4 1 .

Ibid.  </page> <page sequence="20"> A Synecdoche  er, somewhat different from that of Kruszewski : what is similar in  poetic language is the emotive charge belonging to the phonic  and semantic aspects of the word . "The emotions evoked by  certain sounds and their combinations can take various courses :  'pleasure-displeasure, '  'arousal-satisfaction, '  'tension-resolution. '   I t  i s  also absolutely clear that the emotions triggered by sounds  should not take a course antithetical to the emotions triggered by the  'content' of the poem (and vice versa) . . . . T hus, the poet selects  sounds and combinations that emotionally correspond to images  valued by him for some reason,  or, vice versa, he selects images  that emotionally correspond to sounds and combinations that are  significant for some reason in the given circumstances ."44  In addition to the emotive charge of sounds, the similarity of  the phonic and semantic aspects of poetic language is provided  by what Jakubinskij called the "capacity of the speech organs for  expressive movements ."45 There is, he believed, a curious  juncture of emotions and language in our facial expressions .   The movement of our facial muscles can be caused on the one  hand by our emotions, and on the other, by the articulation of  speech sounds . In practical language, where the phone is just a  means, speech sounds can be modified to accommodate the  emotions .  This is impossible, however, in language dominated  by sound. Thus, in verbal art the poet is forced to "select words  whose sounds are pronounced through movements of the  speech organs corresponding roughly to given expressive move­ ments . . . .  Broadly speaking, if the poet experiences emotions  pertaining to a smile (a stretching of the lips sideways) , then he  naturally will avoid sounds articulated by pushing the lips for­ ward (e.g. , u, o) ."46  Another theory of die direct expressiveness of linguistic  sound was formulated by a specialist in Far Eastern languages,  Evgenij Polivanov, in an essay dealing with a phenomenon that  he termed "sound gesture. "  This essay constituted a partial dis- 44. Ibid . ,  p. 45· 45· Ibid .  46. Ibid . ,  p. 48. 15 7   </page> <page sequence="21"> Russian Formalism  putation of Jakubinskij's views. Polivanov began by dividing all  the means of linguistic expression into two by now familiar cate­ gories : the one completely arbitrary and conventional, for exam­ ple, the phonic structure of the Russian word for table­ s+ t+o+ l-which in itself does not suggest its meaning; the other  motivated and natural, such as the intonation that expresses  emotional states and seems to be immediately understandable to  anyone, even to animals. Gestures-nonlinguistic means of ex­ pression that often accompany emotive language-are prime  examples of the latter category. They convey emotions in the  most direct fashion.  Very soon, however, Polivanov undercut this simple opposi­ tion. As he argued, both motivated and arbitrary linguistic ex­ pressions are in fact conventional-deriving from the relation of  contiguity between expressions and their meanings . "If we know  that a given extralinguistic phenomenon is expressed through a  particular intonation or gesture, the origin of this knowledge  can be simply explained by the fact that we have always or often  observed such an emotion accompanied by the given intonation  or gesture . Thus, we have learned this link in precisely the same  fashion as we learned the link between the phonic sequence  s+ t+o+ l  and the representation of table, for this sequence was  always used by the speaker when the thought of table was pre­ sent. "47 Therefore, the difference between so-called natural and  conventional linguistic expressions is not absolute but rather a  matter of degree, an admixture of the two principles.  If all means of expression were placed on a scale from "con­ ventional" to "natural ,"  the closest to the natural , in Polivanov's  opinion, would be mimetic gestures that copy objects or actions  and seem spontaneously comprehensible to everyone. Well  aware that the process of reproduction is always conventional ,  Polivanov calls these gestures "potentially natural. "  The ques­ tion, then, is whether language contains any "phonic sequences  (combinations of vowels and consonants in a certain order)  4 7 .  "Po povodu 'zvukovych zestov' japonskogo jazyka," ibid . ,  p .  30.  </page> <page sequence="22"> A Synecdoche  whose role is analogous to that of potentially natural gestures. "48  The answer is yes , as Polivanov illustrates with numerous Ja­ panese onomatopoetic words imitating sounds, and reduplica­ tive words imitating the repetition of an action or the recurrence  of a phenomenon. By analogy with "mimetic gestures," Pol­ ivanov termed these imitative linguistic expressions "sound  gestures."  Polivanov departed from Jakubinskij both in denying that  emotions are the vehicle of the direct expressiveness of linguistic  sounds, and in not considering the connection between sound  gestures and verbal art.49 In some respects, however, the two  Formalists shared common ground . First of all, Polivanov  claimed that sound gestures and children's language were relat­ ed . "Japanese 'sound gestures' can be regarded in general as the  principle of a special , childish morphology that has retained its  right to existence in the language of adults . "50 In addition, both  Jakubinskij and Polivanov believed that a substantial phonic dif­ ference, which has its roots in pronunciation, existed between  poetic language and sound gestures on the one hand, and · prac­ tical or normal language on the other. For Jakubinskij , the clus­ tering of liquids impedes pronunciation, thus attracting atten­ tion to the sounds themselves . Polivanov observed that in  Japanese onomatopoetic and reduplicative words the phoneme  [p] occurred, which has disappeared from contemporary Ja­ panese except in loan words ; the "nasal g" [q.J is also found in  initial position in these words, though otherwise it occurs only  medially or finally . Such aberrations, Polivanov believed, are  48. Ibid . ,  p. 3 1 .   49. Nevertheless, this connection is implied by the fact that Polivanov's essay  appeared in the OPOJAZ Studies in the Theory of Poetic Language. Viktor Sklovskij  wrote , "The observation that in Japanese poetic language there are sounds  which do not exist in practical Japanese was most likely the first actual indication  that these two languages are divergent" ("Iskusstvo, kak priem," p. 1 04) .  Still, it  seems far-fetched to claim, as Ladislav Matejka does, that Polivanov wrote about  Japanese poetry ( ''The Formal Method and Linguistics," Readings in Russian  Poetics: Formalist and Structuralist Views, ed. L. Matejka and K. Pomorska [Ann  Arbor, Mich. ,  1 978] ,  p. 282) .   50 .

In nor­ mal words, as a matter of fact, it does not make any difference  which phonic complexes express a particular idea . . . .  But ob­ viously for 'onomatopoetic' words, some links between the ex­ pressed representations and particular sounds are important."5 1  Thus, Polivanov concludes, the p in normal language can easily  be replaced by any other speech sound, but it must be retained  in words imitating, for example, the puffing of tobacco smoke or  the sound of a flute .  The Formalists , to be sure, did not claim originality in dis­ covering the importance of oral articulation in language and  verbal art. They refe rred to such nineteenth-century scholars as  the German psychologist Wilhelm Wundt ( 1 832-920) or the  Polish classical philologist Tadeusz Zielinski ( 1 859- 1944), who  had made similar observations about pronunciation as the  bridge between sound and meaning.52 But the Formalists' in­ terest in the articulatory aspect of language was most likely trig­ gered by the rise of Ohrenphilologi,e in the German literary studies  of Eduard Sievers ( 1 850- 1 932 ) ,  his pupil Franz Saran ( 1 866- 1 93 1 ) , and others . In contrast to traditional Augenphilologi,e,  which analyzed the text primarily as a visual or graphic man­ ifestation, Sievers's "aural philology" emphasized the acoustic  aspect of the text. Of particular interest were the involuntary  motor reactions (movements of the diaphragm, bodily motions,  facial expressions, and gestures) accompanying an utterance ,  which, in their opinion, were decisive in articulating the phonic  substance of language.  There are several reasons that Ohrenphilologi,e was so attractive  to the OPOJAZ Formalists. First of all, even though its overall  5 i .  Ibid . ,  p. 34.  52. In an appendix to the first volume of the OPOJAZ Sborniki appeared a  Russian translation of segments of M. Grammont's Le vers fraru;ais and K.  Nyrop's Grammaire historique de la langue fran(aise that discussed the expressive  quality of linguistic sound stemming in part from its articulatory properties (see  Sborniki po teorii poeticeskogo jazyka, vol. 1 ,  pp. 5 1 -7 1 ) .  1 60  </page> <page sequence="24"> A Synecdoche  outlook and goals were incompatible with those of the Russian  Futurists whom the Formalists found so congenial, their respec­ tive views of literature coincided on one important point, name­ ly, that sound is central to poetry. Earlier I mentioned that Kru­ cenych attributed poetic value to foreign languages unknown to  him as one source of his zaum' (see note 20) .  In a striking corre­ spondence Saran wrote : "the theoretician of verse . . . o ught to  adopt toward verse the attitude of a foreigner who listens to it  without knowing the language in which it is written. "53 Jakobson  considered this statement an epitome of the Ohrenphilological  outlook.  Like Ohrenphilologi,e, OPOJAZ was essentially positivistic, at­ tempting to establish a new science of literature that would "turn  to the facts and push aside general systems and problems."54 In  this "new fervor of scientific positivism," sound was considered  the only concrete reality of verbal art, for meaning, in its  ephemerality, was only a subjective mental construct that could  not be pinned down with any certitude. An earlier linguist and  teacher of some of the OPOJAZ members, Lev Scerba ( 1 880- 1 944) ,  had expressed this view in his introduction to a "linguistic  commentary [tolkovanie]" on one of Puskin's poems that was pri­ marily a directive for the proper oral delivery of this text.55 In it,  Scerba argued that "all semantic observations can only be subjec­ tive," whereas the analysis of poetic sound, especially in the oral  reading of a text, can attain to some degree the objectivity of a  laboratory experiment. 56 This claim to scientific objectivity is  reflected in the title of an informative article on Ohrenphilologi,e  53 .

"57 This esteem for the methods  of "aural philology" extended beyond the early stage of For­ malism.58 Aside from the German literary theorist Oskar Walzel  ( 1 864- 1 944) , Sievers and Saran were the only honorary mem­ bers of the Section for Verbal Arts at the State Institute for the  History of the Arts, the institution that absorbed OPOJAZ in the  twenties . 59  Of the contributors to the OPOJAZ Studies, the closest to  Ohrenphilologie was Boris Ejchenbaum. His affinity to this ap­ proach was most likely a function of his age. Born in 1 886,  Ejchenbaum began his literary studies before the advent of For­ malism. Thus, he did not always share the Bohemian proclivities  of some of the younger members of OPOJAZ, apparently more  impressed by sober scholarship than the vague notions of Futur­ ism. The scientism of Ohrenphilologie coincided with Ejchen­ baum's own orientation, as recorded in his diary entry of J anu­ ary 1 9 1 9 : "Proceeding from Rickert, one realizes that the  methods of the natural sciences must be applied to the history of  the arts . . . w hen we deal with the 'nature' of the material from  which the work is made. In [this field] the construction of laws  and definitions is quite conceivable . "60 Moreover, Ejchenbaum  held that the material of verbal art is the oral word.

We think that the writer writes. But it is not always so, and in the  realm of the artistic word it is more often just the opposite. The  German philologists (Sievers, Saran, et al . )  began to argue a few  years ago that the philology of the "eye" (Augenphilologie) must be  replaced by its "aural" counterpart (Ohrenphilologie) .  This is an  extremely fertile idea which has already yielded interesting re­ sults in the domain of verse . . . . S uch an "aural" analysis , howev­ er, is also fruitful for the study of artistic prose. The bases [of this  form] are also marked by its origin in the oral skaz which influ­ ences not only its syntactic structure and the selection and com­ bination of its words, but its very composition.G I  The untranslatable term skaz (akin to the Russian verb skazat' ,  to tell) subsequently gained wide currency in Slavic literary stud­ ies. It  was the focal point of Ejchenbaum's Formalist debut, his  analysis of Gogol's short story, "The Overcoat." Skaz designated  a particular narrative technique in which the elements of oral  delivery play a crucial role. The structure of Gogol's story,  Ejchenbaum claimed, in not organized according to the laws of  the plot but rather by a "certain system of varied expressive­ articulatory facial gestures ."62 In a later study devoted to the  Akmeist poet Anna Achmatova, Ejchenbaum applied the notion  of the articulatory gesture to poetry as well . His thesis was that  Achmatova's poetry "is oriented toward the process of pronun­ ciation,  of expressive [mimiceskij] pronunciation ."63 This orienta­ tion is manifested in the frequent occurrences of what Ejchen­ baum termed the "expressive quality of speech [recevaja mimika]. " He  showed how the repetition of the 'Same or similar vowels or the  juxtaposition of contrasting ones forces the reader to move his  lips in a particular way so that the "words come to be perceived  not as 'sounds' and not as articulation in general but as an ex­ pressive [mimiceski]] motion.

As Ejchenbaum himself observed, the  teens for the Petersburg Formalists were "years of struggle and  polemics ,"  so that "many of the principles [they] advanced dur­ ing these years of intensive struggle with their adversaries were  not merely scholarly principles but paradoxical slogans exagger­ ated for polemical and contrastive purposes. The failure to take  this into account, to treat the 1 9 1 6- 1 92 1 works of OPOJAZ as  strictly scholarly, would be to ignore history."65 The stock-taking  that followed this period of Sturm und Drang was to lead to an  intensive reexamination of the earlier position. The linguistic  approach to verbal art and the key notion of poetic language  were among the first to undergo this scrutiny.  Ejchenbaum himself launched this critique. He commended  the recent confluence of poetics with linguistics as a healthy  counterbalance to the traditional domination of poetics by psy­ chology or sociology. "But," he warned,  a rapprochement with a neighboring discipline can be genuinely  fruitful only if it does not lead to a new submission. In associating  with linguistics , poetics ought to retain its independence. For lin­ guistics, a poetic work is a "phenomenon of language" that fur­ nishes interesting material for the study of phonetic, syntactic, or  semantic issues. Linguistic observations about poetic language en­ rich the general science of language with new phenomena that occur  only rarely in normal "practical speech. "  The literary theoreti­ cian, however fruitful he may find linguistic methods to be,  should pose his questions in a completely different way. What  emerges here is the distinction between the concepts of language  and style, linguistic phenomenon and stylistic device. Linguistics be­ longs among the natural sciences, poetics among the humanities  [nauki o duche] . Linguistics classifies poetic language as one of its  varieties ;  it differentiates among them according to their goals  merely to classify the phenomena of language as functions .  Poet­ ics begins with the separation of poetic language from other lin­ guistic phenomena as an activity set toward a particular goal . And  6,tj. "Teorija 'formal 'nogo metoda,"' p. 1 3 2 .   </page> <page sequence="28"> A Synecdoche  even though this goal cannot be defined with any precision ,  its  symptoms are apparent. In this way, poetics is built on the foun­ dation of a teleological principle and thus proceeds from the  notion of the device; linguistics, like all natural sciences, deals with  the category of causality and therefo.re proceeds from the notion  of the phenomenon as such. 66  Linguistically oriented Formalists tended to dismiss this state­ ment of Ejchenbaum's as a relic of nineteenth-century schol­ arship. Viktor Vinogradov, for example, claimed that "both the  inclusion of linguistics among the natural sciences and the dis­ regard for the teleological principle in it are widespread but  incorrect, narrow-minded ideas . "67  Ejchenbaum was not the only Formalist in the early twenties to  clash with the concept of poetic language and the linguistic ap­ proach to literature so central to OPOJAZ. In a proposal for a  monograph on Evgenij Onegi.n, J urij Tynjanov listed as one of his  topics, "Why poetic language is not a poetic dialect and does not  belong completely within descriptive linguistics ."68 Thus,  Ejchenbaum's (and Tynjanov's) dissent from the other For­ malists cannot be simply swept aside.  Any characterization of Ejchenbaum's position will depend on  what we make of his concept of the device . At first glance , his  contrasting of poetic teleology with linguistic causality may ap­ pear to be another version of Sklovskij's mechanistic model .  However, Ejchenbaum speaks of stylistics and linguistics, and  contrasts the stylistic device with the linguistic phenomenon. In  this respect his polemics recalls Zirmunskij's critique of the  mechanistic metaphor discussed in the preceding chapter. It was  precisely through the notion of style that Zirmunskij reformu­ lated the functional definition of the device. From his stand­ point, style is a principle of unity determined by the overall  artistic goal , which ascribes to each device a specific role within  66.

The device is thus not an a priori, indepen­ dent monad of artistic form for the morphologists, but a func­ tionally integrated element of the work. In the same way,  though from a different theoretical perspective, Tynjanov ar­ gued against an atomistic approach to the device . In his systemic  metaphor, the identity of each element is a function of the hier­ archical relations within the work and the higher systems in  which the element participates.  I t  is obvious that Ejchenbaum's rejection of the linguistic model  was motivated by similar considerations. For the linguist, he  believed, poetic and practical language are nothing but abstrac­ tions. In separating the two, the student of language might classi­ fy them, "among other ways" (Jakubinskij's words), according to  their respective goals. To do so, however, is only a heuristic  procedure, a matter of choice, as Jakubinskij himself demon­ strated when in 1 9 2 2  he rejected the goal as an inadequate  criterion and proposed to classify utterances according to their  actual forms.69 Students of literature, however, do not have this  choice, for they deal with concrete literary works , that is, inten­ tionally created poetic wholes. From their perspective, the on­ tological difference between poetic and practical language (for  example, the clustering of the same liquids) or between sound  gestures and normal linguistic usage (for example, the occur­ rence of the speech sound p) is unimportant. It  is not the presence  or. absence of these particular features that concerned Ejchen­ baum as a literary scholar, but their functional place in the liter­ ary work. "Poetic language," he argued, "is characterized solely  by a particular set toward certain elements of speech and a  specific utilization of them."70  In  more abstract terms, it might be said that the two factions in  OPOJAZ used different "logics ."  Those advocating the linguistic  model were quite dose to the mechanists in casting their catego�  ries in the form of polar oppositions. Their critics shunned this  69.

Thus, the linguist Jakubinskij ,  inspired by the Futurists' zaum', split all linguistic behavior into  two incompatible classes : poetic language oriented solely toward  the phonic aspect of speech, and its opposite, practical language  set towan:l the semantic aspect of speech. His critic, Ejchen­ baum, though considering this a powerful working hypothesis ,  claimed that it was not supported by the facts . Commenting on  practical language, he wrote, "It is quite doubtful that there  actually exists a type of speech in which our attitude toward the  word would be totally mechanical , in which the word would be  exclusively a 'sign. '  Forms such as oratory, for instance, re­ gardless of their 'practical' character, are in many respects quite  close to poetic language."7 1 And Zirmunskij criticized the abso­ lutism of the opposite category, poetic language, conceived as a  purely phonic structure. "If the poet really wanted to affect us  by mere sounds he would take up music ." Poetry "does not  affect the listener by sound as such but by sounding words, i .e . ,   sounds tied to meaning."72  Though Zirmunskij and Ejchenbaum both conceived of style  as the functional integration of elements in an artistic whole,  they disagreed on the nature of this integration. Zirmunskij ,  faithful to his organic metaphor, favored a static notion of the  whole in which elements were harmoniously related. Ejchen­ baum, in contrast, prepared the way for the systemic metaphor  by advocating a more dynamic view. According to him, the unity  of a work was a fragile equilibrium of elements struggling for  domination. I dwelt on this difference in the preceding chapter  and repeat it only to avoid the false impression that Zirmunskij  and Ejchenbaum were speaking the same language. In fact, Zir­ munskij's criticism of those conflating literature and music was  not addressed to the linguistically inclined OPOJAZ members at  all but to Ejchenbaum, in a review of Ejchenbaum's book The  7 1 .

In this work Ejchenbaum had  formulated his dynamic notion of the poetic whole as a struggle  between the organizing element (the dominant of the work) and  the other subordinate elements constituting this whole . He illus­ trated his position with lyric poems in which the dominant into­ nation deformed all the other aspects of language, including  semantics , to its needs.   The deformation of semantics that Ejchenbaum discussed, de­ spite Zirmunskij's claims to the contrary, was quite different  from that described by the early OPOJAZ members . We recall  that they treated poetic language as sound that might but need  not be accompanied by a cognitive meaning. Ejchenbaum was  concerned not with the presence or absence of meaning in a  particular verbal construction, but rather with its function there,  a function determining its hierarchical position relative to the  other elements of the construction. In other words, for him,  meaning is always involved in a verbal construction, but some­ times it is subordinate to other elements and at other times it  dominates them. Oratory , Ejchenbaum argued, may fore­ ground the phonic aspect of language for the sake of persua­ sion, whereas artistic prose may be quite indifferent to sound if  its goal requires this.  Joining Ejchenbaum against Jakubinskij 's separation of poetic  from practical language was Boris Tomasevskij , who wrote, "In­ stead of the clear, though perhaps terminologically unfortunate  opposition of the old scholastic theory, 'poetry' and 'prose, '  we,  following a linguistic path, have advanced another opposition:   'practical' versus 'artistic' language. This opposition, however,  does not cover all aspects of a verbal composition. It  pertains  solely to the sphere of language and, secondly, does not coincide  with the bounds of 'poetry' and 'prose. '  For the 'prosaic' perhaps  as much as the 'poetic' should be contrasted to 'practical' lan­ guage ."73  73 .

He proceeded from Potebnja's original  opposition between poetic and prosaic language, but replaced  the second element with "practical language," which he consid­ ered more appropriate. His critics proceeded in the opposite  fashion ; they retained "prosaic language" and replaced the  other element of the opposition with what they claimed to be the  more accurate concept of "verse language." In the introduction  to his pioneering 1 924 monograph, The Problem of Verse Lan­ guage, Tynjanov explained this step:  "The notion of 'poetic lan­ guage' put forth not so long ago is today in a crisis which is  undoubtedly caused by the broad and diffuse character of this  psychological-linguistic concept. The term 'poetry' that had long  existed in our language and scholarship has now lost its concrete  scope and content and gained an evaluative tinge. In this book I  shall analyze the specific concept of verse (in opposition to the  concept of prose) and the specific features of verse language. "74  These conceptual shifts were not solely a matter of termi­ nology. By substituting the notion of practical language for Pot­ ebnja's "prose," Jakubinskij was redefining the category of the  poetic . The same was true of his critics. Their opposition be­ tween verse and prose is not equivalent to the earlier dichotomy  of poetry and prose. The early OPOJAZ members ignored  verse, considering verse rhythm just one of many artistic devices  that de-familiarize the sound stratum of language, whereas their  74.

In this passage Tyn­ janov insists on a subtle but untranslatable difference between two synonymic  adjectives stichotvornyj and stichovoj, both rendered in English as "verse ." His  preference for stichovoj most likely can be attributed to the fact that jakubinskij ,   who conceived of  "verse language" as  a mere subcategory of  "poetic language,"  used stichotvornyj (see note 26 above). For this reason, it is quite surprising that  stichotvornyj, rejected by Tynjanov, should have appeared in the very title of his  book. Tynjanov's correspondence reveals, however, that this title was chosen by  his publisher who was apprehensive about the original title Problema stichovoj  semantiki (see Tynjanov's letter to Lev Lune of January 14 ,  1 924, reprinted in  Novy} iurnal, no. 83 [ 1 966], 142 ) .   </page> <page sequence="33"> Russian Formalism  critics argued that verse and prose occur in both literature and  byt. 75 What these two forms represent is not the opposition of art  to nonart, but two different principles of verbal construction,  or  what Tynjanov called functions. Tomasevskij wrote in his com­ . prehensive Russian Versification that "the difference between  prose and verse rests in the fact that in verse the phonic imper­ ative [zvukovoe zadanie] dominates the semantic one and in prose  the semantic dominates the phonic one. Everything boils down  to the relative role of these two origins . "76 Similarly , Tynjanov  argued that "it would be premature to conclude that verse form  differs from prose form merely because in verse the external  sign of the word plays the exclusive role whereas in prose such a  role is performed by its meaning." He concluded, "Prose and  poetry, it seems, do not differ from each other in their imma­ nent phonation and in the consequent set toward sound in poet­ ry and semantics in prose, but rather in the way these two ele­ ments interact :  how the semantic aspect of prose deforms its  phonic aspect (the mental set toward the semantic) and how  verse deforms the meaning of the word."77  In short, the linguistic model and its fundamental concept,  poetic language, underwent a criticism within OPOJAZ in the  early twenties that entailed a significant shift in the scholarly  endeavors of the group. Of course, this shift was not a total  abandonment of the previous Formalist tradition .  Those who  rejected the "vague" and "inadequate" concept of poetic lan­ guage followed the path established by their predecessors in one  75.  In  the conclusion to his "Art as Device," Sklovskij promised to devote a  special book to the problems of rhythm. This plan never materialized, however,  perhaps because Sklovskij considered poetic rhythm nothing but a deformation  of prosaic rhythm, a deformation that must remain unpredictable and hence  unsystematizable in order to carry out its de-familiarizing function ( "lskustvo,  kak priem," p.  1 1 4) .   76.

The principles of Russian versification the Formalists inher­ ited were those of the great poet-theoreticians of the Symbolist  generation, A. Belyj and V. Brjusov. Though innovative in their  approach to the study of verse (Belyj , for instance, was the first  1 .

In their eyes , the three major fail­ ings of Symbolist metrics were as follows : first, an atomistic ap­ proach to verse; next, the separation of meter from rhythm; and  finally, prosodic egocentrism.  The Symbolists considered the  foot the minimal unit of verse. Unable to detect any overall  gestalt in the verse under study, they arbitrarily analyzed even  the most regular verse into heterogeneous feet. This blindness  to the holistic nature of verse stemmed from their divorce of  meter from rhythm. They insisted that meter was an ideal  scheme existing prior to verse, whereas rhythm was the actual  pattern of deviations from this scheme. Because the Symbolists  attributed aesthetic value precisely to such deviations, in their  own analyses they purposely sought to segment verse into as  many different kinds of feet as possible.  To avoid the problems of Symbolist metrics, Brik's study did  away with the concept of meter entirely. Instead it treated  rhythm as the motoric or kinetic precondition of verse. "As a  scholarly term, rhythm means a particular formation of the  motor processes . . . m otion shaped in a particular way."3  Rhythmic shaping is a function of quantity (the increase or  decrease in motion) and duration (the continuity or discreteness  of motion) .  The projection of rhythm onto verbal material-the  kinetic organization of an utterance in terms of stresses and  intervals--constitutes what Brik terms the "rhythmical impulse."   This impulse organizes the verse as a whole, a fact that had elu­ ded the Symbolist theoreticians. Only if we know the rhythmical  movement of the entire poem can we correctly identify its small­ er units. Brik takes as an illustration a line from Puskin, which in  isolation seems dactylic but within the poem as a whole turns out  to be trochaic . He concludes, "one should not speak of strong  and light syllables [downbeats and upbeats] but of stressed and  unstressed ones. Theoretically, any syllable can be stressed or  unstressed ; everything depends on the rhythmical impulse. "4  3. "Ritm i sintaksis, "  Novyj Lef, i 927 ,  no. 3, 1 6.  4. Ibid . ,  i 7 .   r 73  </page> <page sequence="37"> Russian Formalism  Brik's statement clearly reflects the iconoclastic attitude of his  Hylaean friends toward traditional accentual-syllabic versifica­ tion. As they wrote in 1 9 1 3 , "we stopped seeking meters in the  · schoolbooks ; every motion generates a new, free rhythm for the  poet."5 To achieve such total rhythmical freedom, Futurist poets  manipulated language in a particular way, as they themselves  admitted. They "disregarded grammatical rules" and "shattered  syntax."  It soon became evident to Brik, however, that the ma­ jority of Russian verse is written in more traditional language  than zaum',  language whose words are units of meaning com­ bined semantically as well as prosodically .  To account for the semantic constraint upon the rhythmical  impulse in ordinary Russian verse, Brik returned to the concept  of syntax disdained by the Futurists. "Syntax," he wrote, "is the  system of combining words in ordinary language. As long as  verse language does not abandon the essential laws of prosaic  syntax these laws are obligatory for it."6 Thus, the relationship  of sound and meaning in verse is necessarily complex; it is al­ ways a compromise between rhythmical and syntactic considera­ tions. A verse line, in Brik's opinion, is the minimal implementa­ tion of this rhythmical-syntactic compromise. It  is a unit  separated from the rest of the utterance to which it belongs on  the basis of its prosodic features, but at the same time containing  syntactic connections among its elements . "A rhythmical-syntac­ tic word combination differs from a purely syntactic one in that  it incorporates words into a fixed rhythmical unit (a line) ; it  differs from a purely rhythmical combination in that it links  words not only phonetically but semantically ."7 Rhythmical and  syntactic requirements may coincide in verse, as when a line is a  complete sentence, or they may clash, for example, in caesuras  or enjambments . In either case, words in verse are always subject  to two sets of combinatory rules.  5.  D. Burljuk, et al. ,  Sadok sudej I I  (St Petersburg, 1 9 1 3) ,  reprinted in V.

Ibid.  1 74  </page> <page sequence="38"> A Synecdoche  The value of Brik's essay for Formalist metrics lay in its firm  grasp of the structuring principle of verse. This grasp, however,  was achieved only at the cost of considerable oversimplification,  and all subsequent Formalist studies of the topic complicated  Brik's clear-cut picture. Its first limitation was its equation of the  vehicle of rhythm with word stress alone. Obviously, in addition  to the stress within an isolated word there are a variety of  stresses belonging to higher syntactic units . Once this premise is  accepted, syntax can no longer be seen in simple opposition to  rhythm as meaning versus sound. Syntax actually consists of  both phonic and semantic strata . Furthermore, the phonology  of syntax cannot be limited to the intensity of the voice (syntactic  stress) .  The voice also has pitch, whose modulation creates syn­ tactic intonation. It was this aspect of verse that Ejchenbaum  examined in his study of the melodics of Russian lyric poetry.  Ejchenbaum divided the lyric into three categories according  to the role played in each by intonation. In the declamatory (rhet­ orical) lyric, intonation supports the logical structure of the text;  in the conversational lyric it serves to link the verse to everyday  language. In both these types of lyric , intonation is subordinate  to other verse elements . In the third lyric type, intonation per­ forms a more significant function. This is the singable (napevnyj)  lyric, which purposely imitates musical melody. In such poetry  "we observe not a simple alternation of speech intonations but a  developed system of intonation that determines the composition of  the poem more than its verbal themes ."8 Only such intonational  schemes-symmetries, repetitions, or cadences--can in Ejchen­ baum's view be called melodics proper. Here intonation ceases  to be a mere epiphenomenon and becomes the organizing prin­ ciple of verse-its dominant.  The semantic aspect of syntax is subordinated to intonation in  this type of lyric. For example, Vasilij Zukovskij , a Russian poet  of the first half of the nineteenth century, exploited the syntactic  patterns of emotive language for melodic ends. Some of his  8. Melodika russkogo liriceskogo sticha (Petersburg, 1 922 ) ,  p. g.  r 75  </page> <page sequence="39"> Russian F onnalism  poems are merely a series of interrogative sentences combined  with exclamations. Afanasij Fet ( 1 820- 1 892 ) ,  in contrast, built  his melodics on intonational emphasis. To attain it he inverted  word order, repeated lexical items in significant positions (ana­ phora, epiphora) and employed syntactic parallelism.  With such  cases in mind, Ejchenbaum concluded that the "analysis of the  melodic style in which the role of intonation is obvious suggests  the need for a study of the role it plays in verse in general . "9  The strength and the disadvantage of Ejchenbaum's study lie  in its specialization. His scheme convincingly illustrated the idea  that verse is a hierarchical structure and called attention to one  hitherto neglected element of this structure. But given its au­ thor's mistrust of linguistics , the concept of syntax with which it  operated was vague, to say the least. Furthermore, by focusing  on intonation, it inevitably slighted other important factors. A  study of melodics cannot substitute for a general theory of verse .  The formulation of such a theory was left to the other  Formalists .  In 1 9 1 9 , at a lecture before the Moscow Linguistic Circle ,  Boris Tomasevskij defined the role of rhythm in verse as the  "distribution of expirational energy within the limits of one  wave-the verse . " 1 0  This definition is broad enough to subsume  both Brik's rhythmical impulse and Ejchenbaum's melodics. In  addition to "lexical-accentual" (slovesno-udarnyJ) and "intona­ tional-syntactic" (intonacionno-frazovoj) rhythm, Tomasevskij  spoke of "harmonic" rhythm. 1 1  Borrowed from the French lin­ guist Maurice Grammont ( 1 866- 1 946) , "harmony" designates  the relation between speech sound distribution and the rhyth­ mical organization of the line. In verse, according to  Tomasevskij , "harmony fulfills a twofold task: first, dissimila­ tion-the segmentation of speech into rhythmical periods ; sec­ ond , assimilation-the evocation of the idea that the segments  thus marked are analogous ." 1 2   9 .

On the  one hand, it demarcates one rhythmical unit (a line) from the  text, and on the other, it renders the two lines analogous  through the repetition of sounds. But rhyme is not the only such  phenomenon in verse. As Brik argued, verse is always marked  by the orchestration of speech sounds. Using Puskin's and Ler­ montov's poems as examples, he showed how thoroughly poetry  is permeated with sound repetition.  Tomasevskij's attitude toward sound repetition differed con­ siderably from Brik's. Tomasevskij was not interested in repeti­ tion as a manifestation of the "fundamental euphonic laws" of  poetic language, but as a functional element of rhythmically  organized speech. In the Russian trochaic tetrameter, he ar­ gued, even feet carry stress more often than odd ones and the  line tends to break into two colons each composed of one strong  and one weak foot. This rhythmical partition of the line is un­ derscored by the distribution of vowels in Puskin's verse (where  each downbeat is stressed) :   On imel odno viden 'e  o--e o--e  (He had a single vision) l 3   This, of course, is just  one instance of the correlation of speech  sound repetition and verse rhythm, and Tomasevskij provides  many others to support his thesis that "verse 'harmony' belongs  fully within the theory of rhythm." 1 4  Not only was Tomasevskij's theory of verse rhythm more in­ clusive than that of the other OPOJAZ members, but it was  constructed from the standpoint of the perceiving subject. 1 5 In   discussing harmonic rhythm, for example, he  stressed its capaci­ ty for evoking the idea of analogy in the subject. In this respect  he departed considerably from both Brik and Ejchenbaum. Brik  1 3 .  Ibid . ,  p. 23 .   14 .  Ibid . ,  p. 24 .   1 5 .  For a detailed discussion of this topic see M.  Cervenka, "Rytmicky im­ puls ," pp. 73-84.  1 77   </page> <page sequence="41"> Russian Formalism  arrived at his concept of the rhythmical impulse from the per­ spective of the creating subject. The kinetic organization of the  verse (the regular distribution of word stresses in it) engenders  motor processes that are present during its generation.  The per­ ceiver merely re-presents this original motion in his or her read­ ing. It might seem that Ohrenphilologie had reversed this hier­ archy in stressing the aural perception of verse, so that the  perceiving subject was its point of departure as well, but this  shift was purely a heuristic device. Sievers's experiments with  recitation in fact served as the basis for reconstructing what he  took to be the correct authorial reading. And Ejchenbaum delib­ erately bracketed off the act of perception, seeking only the  "objective" preconditions of verse melodics that he identified  with syntax: "Independent of individual nuances in reading,  syntactic structure is a totally objective fact and syntactic intona­ tion, within the bounds of our requirements , is obligatory ." 1 6   This reduction of  verse to its "objective" preconditions was  clearly unacceptable to Tomasevskij . "We do not recognize verse  through immediate perception," he argued in the opening para­ graph of Russian Versification. " 'Verse-quality' [priznak stichotvor­ nosti] is generated not solely from the objective attributes of  poetic language, but from the conditions of its artistic percep­ tion as well , from the hearer's judgment about it based on his  taste . " 1 7 Thus, the starting point of metrics should not be  rhythm as such but its constitution in the perceiver's conscious­ ness.  At the most abstract level, rhythm is experienced when a  "phenomenon becomes arranged in 'periods' that are perceived  as 'isochronous , '  whereas in objective time they may be un­ equal ."  1 8 This is  a generalization of Tomasevskij's observations  on the twofold task of "harmonic rhythm" discussed earlier. The  constitution of rhythm in the perceiver's consciousness has both  dissimilative and assimilative aspects. It dissolves the utterance  16 .  Melodika russkogo lirileskogo sticha, p. 1 6.  1 7 .

In terms of the inner experience of time, this act can be  described as a continuous interplay of expectations and fulfill­ ments. The reading of a "long series of repeated, analogous  lines creates a sort of rhythmical inertia in the perceiver, a  scheme of 'prosodic expectations . '  " 1 9 Expectation alone is insuf­ ficient for the arousal of rhythm in consciousness : "Regularity  distinguishes rhythmical speech from unorganized, unregulated  speech only if the formed complex of phonic phenomena . . .   recurs and is perceived as similar, thus enforcing in perception  the sensation of this 'regularity . ' " :.fhe fulfillment of expecta­ tions, the " 'recognition' at every moment of a recurring reg­ ularity ," must accompany the original expectation for the  emergence of rhythm in the perceiver's consciousness. 20  Conceptualized so generally, however, the notion of rhythm  clearly exceeds the sphere of metrics. The experience of rhythm  as just described occurs not only in poetry but in the other  temporal arts , as well as in extra-artistic areas. Second, "rhythm"  in Tomasevskij's usage refers to the "objective" stratum of rhyth­ mical experience, the real phonic sequence that the perceiver  faces. In its actual physical heterogeneity, this stratum inevitably  defies systematic description. According to Tomasevskij ,  "rhythm can only be concrete, can be based only on the elements  of phonation that we hear or actually take into account in both  rhythmical and nonrhythmical speech. "2 1 In this respect, rhythm  is a singular phenomenon : every utterance, every line, can have  its own rhythm based on the repetition of any phonic element. In  relation to verse, Tomasevskij prefers not to use the term  "rhythm" but to speak instead of the "rhythmical impulse. "   As I pointed out  earlier, the concept of the rhythmical impulse  was introduced into Formalist terminology by Osip Brik. With  Tomasevskij , however, it acquired quite a different meanmg.  19.

The isochronism of verse periods im­ plies a selection among phonic features, the designation of those  to be considered equal . Tomasevskij calls these "rhythm-creating  elements ."  Thus , verse, in "dissolving itself into periods that are  subjectively evaluated as equivalent, maintains the law common  to all periods and orders its rhythm-creating elements analo­ gously . "22 This reduction of all phonic data to those that are  rhythm-creating, and hence regularly repeated throughout a  poem, limits considerably the number of rhythmical possibilities  and provides the perceiver with a grid or skeletal structure within  which the interplay of expectations and fulfillments takes place.  _ For under these conditions "rhythm is perceived against the  background of an average rhythmical scheme, the most frequent,  most expected one. We shall call this rhythmical expectation  created in our perception by the aggregate effect of a series of  recited lines, this 'general idea' about the rhythmical character of  a poem, the rhythmical impulse. "23  It must be stressed, however, that Tomasevskij distinguished  rhythm in general from the rhythmical impulse proper to verse  not only on intrinsic criteria. The heterogeneous phonic ele­ ments whose repetition constitutes rhythm lack a social and his­ torical dimension. As rhythm occurs outside language, virtually  any phonic feature can serve as its vehicle , but verse language is a  linguistic phenomenon and its repertoire of rhythm-creating  elements is necessarily restricted by the social nature of language .  "Language," in Tomasevskij's view, "is what links the speaker to  the hearer. The speaker not only utters words but also listens to  them, and the hearer is not absolutely passive in his listening.  Language is apprehended because the hearer knows it. The  2 2 .  "Ritm prozy," p. 260.  23.

The  most passive listening is always 'accompanied by an activity­ inner speech. Thus, reception and production inextricably com­ prise any linguistic fact. Only those features copresent in pronun­ ciation and perception can be essential to language . Only this  link-the consonance of the utterer and the hearer-is real lan­ guage. "24 In terms of the theory of verse , not every linguistic  idiosyncrasy of interlocutors (such as a poet's stammer) , but only  those that are obligatory for both utterer and hearer, can become  rhythm-creating elements in verse. This premise was elaborated  in detail by Jakobson in a book on Czech metrics written about the  same time as Tomasevskij's remarks (see below pp. 238-40) . It   became the cornerstone of his phonological metrics, which  Tomasevskij himself embraced in the mid- 1 92os.  The social nature of literature and the history of verse impose  another constraint on the selection of rhythm-creating elements .  In encountering a poem, for example, hearers or readers are  usually not a tabula rasa, innocent minds exposed to verse for the ,  first time. Almost always they carry with them the memory of  their previous dealings with poems, a backlog of literary educa­ tion, tradition,  and so forth. The fact that they are willing to see  the various lines of a poem as comparable, even if quite dissimilar,  indicates that the constitution of the rhythmical impulse has at its  basis some canonized set of rhythmical conventions . This for  Tomasevskij is "meter."  Metrical norms function similarly to  linguistic ones in the perception of verse rhythm. They "make the  comparison [of verse units] easier by highlighting those features  whose apprehension yields material for appraising the equiv­ alence of speech periods. The goal of these norms is to provide a  prearranged system for organizing the system of phonations, that neces­ sary conventionality which links the poet with his audience and  helps his rhythmical intentions to be perceived."25  24. "Problema stichotvornogo ritma," p. 30.  25. Ibid . ,  p.  i 1 .   </page> <page sequence="45"> Russian F onnalism  In using the concept of meter, however, Tomasevskij did not  revert to the Symbolist dichotomy of meter and rhythm. For him,  the two were not absolutely distinct: "It is clear that the study of a  norm cannot be separated from the study of actual possibilities ,  the concrete forms of the phenomenon that are subject to this  norm."26 The actual implementation of a metrical norm is not a  series of deviations from an untenable ideal but a set of tenden­ cies complying to one degree or another with this norm. Thus,  Tomasevskij's i 9 1 9  study of Puskin's iambic pentameter mea­ sures statistically the tendency of syllables to be stressed. As might  be expected, odd syllables are stressed only exceptionally ; even  ones are much more frequently stressed, but even these are not  stressed equally . Only the last syllable (or the penultimate one in  feminine endings) carries an obligatory stress, because "this sylla- ·  ble is the boundary of the rhythmical series (the line) and subse­ quent syllables . . . d o not continue this series but lie outside of  it. "27 On all the other even syllables, stress is distributed accord­ ing to poetic style. Puskin's iamb differs in this respect from the  iambs of other nineteenth-century poets, and even the propor­ tion of stressed syllables varies in different stages of his career.  Tomasevskij 's conception of meter also differs from the Sym­ bolists' in its relativism. Different languages inevitably employ  different prosodic elements as vehicles of the "same meter." And  even within a single poetic tradition the metrical system changes  in time. The change is triggered by shifts in the hierarchy of what  Tomasevskij calls primary and secondary features of verse. A  primary feature is a regular distribution of one phonic element  canonized by a given metrical convention. "Thus, in classical  [Russian] metrics, the canonized element of sound ordered ac­ cording to the metrical norms is accent ."28 Because verse lan­ guage is a complex structure of correlated elements, the can­ onized ordering of one phonic feature entails the regular  distribution of others. This patterning, though often vague or  26 .  "Stich i ritm : Metodologiceskie zameeanija," 0 stiche: Stat'i, pp. 53-54.  27. "Pjatistopnyj jamb Puskina," p. 1 4 1 .   28 .  "Problema stichotvornogo ritma," p .  8 .   </page> <page sequence="46"> A Synecdoche  subliminal , creates the secondary features of verse, that is, its  actual rhythm. Such a clear-cut distinction between primary and  secondary features exists only at the moment when a particular  metrical system is generally accepted as the only one possible.  When its authority begins to be questioned , the secondary fea­ tures come to the fore. Poets realize that "it is possible to write  verse governed only by secondary features, that an utterance can  sound like verse even without meter. "29 Ultimately such a situation  leads to the abandonment of the previous metrical norm and the  establishment of one of the secondary features as a rhythm­ creating element.  Given the paramount role of meter in generating the rhyth­ mical impulse, it is not remarkable that Tomasevskij considered it  the "specific differentia of verse vis-a-vis prose."30 But insofar as  he defined verse as the implementation of a specific metrical  norm, he was unable to account for its overall unity . It was  impossible for him to say what iambic and trochaic verse have in  common, or, given the geographical and historical relativity of  meters, what the connection is between, say, iambic verse in  different languages or different historical periods .  Therefore,   Tomasevskij introduced the concept of verse language, which  unites metrically disparate verse on the basis of other shared  properties .  For instance, "in contemporary European practice  the custom was established of writing verse in even lines differ­ entiated by capital letters , and to print prose in continuous lines  without breaks. Despite the heterogeneity of graphia and living  speech, this fact is significant, because there are specific linguistic  associations with writing. The segmentation of the utterance into  'lines, ' periods whose phonic potential is comparable or even  identical in very simple cases, is evidently the distinctive feature  of verse language."3 1  This fact, however, does not imply that prose written as verse  will always and everywhere be perceived as such, or vice versa.  29.

I r83  </page> <page sequence="47"> Russian Formalism  The customary graphic arrangement merely signals to the Euro­ pean reader one formal difference between verse and prose , but  does not establish either of them. Only the projection of an  utterance against the current metrical norm can do that. For  Tomasevskij meter is a relative category ; therefore, "there is no  hard boundary between prose and verse ."32  Tomasevskij 's claim was almost immediately challenged by  Jurij Tynjanov, who devoted an entire monograph entitled The  Problem of Verse Language to discovering a factor capable of differ­ entiating verse from prose. However, Tynjanov's argument with  Tomasevskij did not involve a radically different view of verse  language. As I shall show, the two were quite close on many  essential issues, but the logic of Tynjanov's systemic metaphor  and his insights into the semantic dimension of verse led him to  different conclusions.  As I argued in the preceding chapter, the key concept of  Tynjanov's poetics was the literary system. Understood as a hier­ archical set of variables, it consisted of a series of correlated  subsystems (for example, genres) ,  which in turn consisted  of individual work-systems. Tynjanov related the interdepen­ dent variables through the concept of "function." Thus, every  work exhibits a particular function-a correlation of the domi­ nant constructive factor with the subordinate material . This  function, dubbed by Tynjanov the "principle of construction,"  goes beyond the level of the single work. It  unites individual  works into literary subsystems-interdependent variables in the  overall literary system. This system is not simply a logical con­ struct; it has a historical correlate-the series of actual literary  forms evolving in time. 33 These forms are not just accidents of  history that cannot be systematically studied ; they are embodi­ ments of specific functions and their continuity or change is  32 .

From this perspective, the Formalist Tynjanov held that verse  language should not be treated as a form alone, but also as a  function. The fact that poetry, unlike prose, has long been writ­ ten in even lines betrays a fundamental functional difference  between them. For Tynjanov, verse and prose were the two most  general literary subsystems constituted through the inversion of  their respective principles of construction. "In verse the pivotal  constructive factor is rhythm and the material (in a broad sense) is  the semantic grouping; in prose the constructive factor is the seman­ tic grouping (the plot) and the material is the rhythmical (in the  broad sense) elements of the word. "34 The opposition between  prose and poetry is thus not absolute but a function of the literary  system as a whole. As the system evolves, the "time may come  when it will be inessential whether a work is written in verse or  prose, but as long as the distinction between prose and poetry  remains palpable, their two contrastive principles of construction  coexist within the literary system. 35  Because by definition the principle of construction is always a  correlation of two elements-in the case of verse, rhythm and  meaning--one cannot adequately describe verse by describing  only its dominant component, rhythm. On this point Tynjanov  departs significantly from Tomasevskij , who confined his poetic  study to metrics, a "discipline . . . s tudying the principles that  underlie the ordering of actual rhythm."36 Tynjanov believed the  theory of verse language must also include verse semantics, which  is a "discipline concerned with the meanings of words and verbal  groups, and their evolution and shift in poetry."37 The deforma­ tion of meaning in verse distinguishes it from prose as signifi- 34.

According to Tynjanov,  "prose and poetry are enclosed semantic categories ;  prosaic  meaning is always distinct from poetic meaning, and conse­ quently poetic syntax and even its vocabulary are also essentially  different from those of prose. "38 By systematically examining the  meaning of the lexical units that make up verse, Tynjanov went  beyond the other OPOJAZ members who (beginning with Brik)  claimed they were including semantics within their schemes. In  fact, these Formalists reduced semantics to syntax, the rules for  combining words into more complex meaningful wholes , and  neglected the actual lexical content of the words involved.  Tynjanov's treatment of rhythm, however, did not differ  much from that of the other Formalists . In conceiving of it pri­ marily as a "motor-energic" phenomenon, he was quite close to  Brik. Instead of speaking of verse isochronism (whether objec­ tive or subjective) ,  he treated rhythmical segmentation as a  quantity of labor or energy expended. 39 As we have seen, the  idea of verbal art as energy-extensive language was the basis for  Sklovskij's conception of artistic de-familiarization, but in his  purposive explanation of art the significance of rhythm lay in its  effect upon the perceiver.  Rhythmical irregularities were sup­ posed to frustrate the reader's expectations, thus requiring  more effort on his or her part. In Tynjanov's systemic meta­ phor, on the other hand, rhythm participates in the constructive  function-a hierarchical correlation with other elements of the  work. Here the labor involved in the rhythmical organization of  verse seems to be the energy source for the ongoing struggle for  domination of its elements.  Tynjanov's conception of rhythm was perfectly in keeping  with his overall antisubstantialist position .  As energy, rhythm  cannot be identified with any of the phonic elements constitut­ ing verse . Rather, it is a system-a dynamic interplay of many  factors : " 'Rhythm' [is] the entire dynamics of the poem compris- 38. "O kompozicii Evgenija Onegina," ibid . ,  p. 55.  39.

"40 Among  these, Tynjanov claimed, meter plays the dominant role. Al­ though this apparently echoes Tomasevskij's belief in the para­ mount significance of meter for verse, a closer scrutiny reveals a  difference. In Tynjanov's view, what dominates rhythm is not  meter as a system of regularly alternating prosodic features, but  rather the "principle of meter, "  in other words, the "dynamic  grouping of verbal material according to a prosodic feature .  Most elementary and basic to this is the singling out of some  metrical group as a unit. This act also prepares dynamically for  the isolation of a subsequent, similar group. If this metrical  preparation is realized we get a metrical system."4 1 Even if this  preparation is not realized in the subsequent group, even if the  metrical system is absent (as in free verse) ,  we are still dealing  with verse language. " 'Unrealized preparation' is also a dyna­ mizing instance. Meter is preserved in the form of a metrical  impulse. Every 'nonrealization' involves a metrical regrouping:  either as a coordination of the two units (carried out pro­ gressively) or as a subordination (carried out regressively) . . . .   Here the meter as a system is replaced by meter as a dynamic  principle, namely, the set toward meter, the equivalent of  meter. "42  As the term "metrical impulse" indicates, Tynjanov's "meter"  covered what Tomasevskij perceived to be two separate catego­ ries. In the sense of "metrical system," it coincided roughly with  Tomasevskij's notion of meter, but as the "equivalent of meter,"  it overlapped with Tomasevskij's "rhythmical impulse." For  Tomasevskij the rhythmical impulse alone could not constitute  verse ; for Tynjanov the principle of meter would .43 This vari- 40. "Ob osnovach kino," Poetika, istorija literatury, kino, p. 34 1 .   4 1 .  Problema stichotvornogo jazyka, p .  30.  42. Ibid.  43. Apparently in the mid-twenties, perhaps under Tynjanov's influence,  Tomasevskij modified his position somewhat. Thus in 1 925 he was willing to  concede that "Majakovskij 's verse is constrained merely by its rhythmical im­ pulse" ("Stich i ritm," p. 59).  </page> <page sequence="51"> Russian Formalism  ance reflects the difference in Tomasevskij 's and Tynjanov's ori­ entations. Tomasevskij proceeded from concrete verse forms,  concentrating on their heterogeneity, whereas Tynjanov pro­ ceeded from the general category of the literary system. Striving  to discover the identity of verse as a function within this overall  system, Tynjanov concentrated on what poems have in common.  Naturally then, Tynjanov rejected features that were charac­ teristic of verse at one point but later disappeared. Meter, in the  sense of a prosodic system, was such a case . "In a certain literary  system the function of verse was fulfilled by the formal element  of meter. But prose diversified and evolved, and so did verse.  The diversification of one type of [sound-meaning] correlation  involves, or better, is linked to the diversification of another type  of correlation. The rise of metrical prose (with Andrej Belyj )  was  connected to the transference of the verse function from meter  to other features of verse that were often secondary or concomi­ tant, such as the rhythm-demarcating verse units, particular syn­ tactic forms, or vocabulary. The function of prose or verse re­ mains, but the formal elements fulfilling it are different."44  Thus, in a seeming paradox, Tynjanov reversed the hierarchy  between central and peripheral features as markers of verse .  Because central features are always the prime victims of histor­ ical change, the identity of a verse system lies in its peripheral  features, in those elements that despite changes in the center  continue to distinguish it from prose. "The principle of con­ struction is revealed not in the maximum conditions comprising  it, but in the minimal ones. For it is obvious that these minimal  conditions are the ones intrinsic to the given construction and in  them we should seek the key to the specific character of the  construction. "45 Free verse, then, belongs to the verse system  despite the fact that it does not correspond to any metrical sys­ tem. By segmenting a continuous utterance into rhythmical pe­ riods it transforms the verbal material according to the same  principle as metrically regular verse.  44. "O literaturnoj evoljucii ," p. 59.  45.  Problema stichotvornogo jazyka, p. i 7 .   188  </page> <page sequence="52"> A Synecdoche  There is, however, one important difference between free  verse and more traditional verse forms. In metrically regular  verse , recurrent rhythmical units tend to be smaller than those  of free verse. They are the syllable, foot, and hemistich, whereas  in verse organized solely by the metrical principle, the basic unit  is the entire line. In the absence of any prosodic system, the only  marker of such a unit is its graphic form. In free verse "graphics  plays a special role, for it stands not only for the rhythm but for  the metrical unit as well. Here graphics is the signal of a line , of  rhythm, and by the same token of metrical dynamics-the indis­ pensable condition of rhythm."46 For this reason, Tynjanov, un­ like Tomasevskij , ascribed major importance to the graphic  form of verse. Graphic form provides the minimal conditions  for the rise of rhythm as the dominant factor of verse construc­ I\  tion. Tynjanov believed that not only rhythm, the constructive fac­tor of verse, was reducible to its graphic form, but the subordi­nate material-that is , the semantic groups within it, was as well .  i In Puskin's poetry, for example, a series of dots sometimes re­places a line or a group of lines, as in the original version of the  i  l1i  thirteenth stanza of "To the Sea" :    The world has emptied . . . . . .  .  Here, three and one-half lines of dots serve as the graphic equiv­ alent of the same expanse of words. This substitution is purely  graphic ; no oral rendition is possible. The voice has at its dis­ posal only a pause-a silence indicating the absence of words.  The graphic equivalent signals the presence of this absence, and  in doing so carries the metrical energy of the verse. "Obviously,  the successive segmentation and reunification of metrical ele­ ments . . . d oes not occur [here]. The meter is given only as a  46. Ibid . ,  p. 3 i .   </page> <page sequence="53"> Russian Formalism  sign, a potential that is hard to detect. To us, however, the frag­ ment and the dots are equal to the entire stanza and we perceive  the lines of the following stanza . . . p recisely as the following  stanza. That is, a stanza has elapsed between the fragment com­ mencing the stanza discussed and the next stanza, and the frag­ ment carries the metrical energy of the whole stanza."47 As long  as the semantically empty dots serve the constructive principle  and fulfill the function of actual words, they are a minimal  equivalent of the material in the verse construction.  Earlier I suggested that Tynjanov conceived of verse rhythm  as a system composed not only of the dominant meter but of  other rhythmical factors . The most important of these are sound  repetition and rhyme, which Tomasevskij included under the  rubric of harmonic rhythm, as we have seen. For Tomasevskij ,  sound repetition and rhyme operate on the principle of expecta­ tion and fulfillment, thus performing the twofold task of rhyth­ mical dissimilation and assimilation. Tynjanov considered them  only secondary rhythmical factors because the proportion of  progressive and regressive forces they command differs from  that of meter. In meter, the progressive force is most important.  It in itself is capable of generating rhythm, as in free verse ,  where the regressive realization of the initial expectation is for­ ever frustrated. The perception of sound repetition is just the  opposite. It lacks all progressive force or, as Tynjanov cautiously  added in a footnote, it "is extremely weak. "48 We usually do not  expect a sound to be repeated. In rhyme, on the other hand,  both forces-regressive and progressive-operate. Neverthe­ less, Tynjanov argues that here regression is the primary factor.  This claim may require some clarification. One could object  that in a regularly rhymed and strophically organized poem the  progressive force is paramount: the reader has every expecta­ tion of the recurrence of a rhyming ending. For Tynjanov, how­ ever, this situation merely shows rhyme under maximal condi- 47. Ibid . ,  p .  24.  48. Ibid . ,  p .  i 28 .   </page> <page sequence="54"> A Synecdoche  tions. In texts with looser rhyme and strophic schemes, the  reader's expectation that some subsequent lines will conclude  with a group of sounds similar to those he or she is presently  perceiving drops considerably. Tynjanov illustrates this claim  with a poem of Tjutcev's in which a rhyme separated by five  verse lines passes by virtually unnoticed. 49 What accounts for  the weak effect of this rhyme is the lack of expectation on the  reader's part, for he or she realizes it only regressively, and then  only if he or she has retained the first rhyming ending over an  interval of five lines . Rhyme, moreover, is secondary to meter  because it depends on prior metrical segmentation :  the rhyming  sounds occupy the same positions within lines that have already  been metrically delimited .  I All utterances organized according to the constructive princi­ I ple of verse just outlined exhibit, according to Tynjanov, four \ essential features . 50 The first he calls the unity of the verse sequence [rjad] , which is created by metrically isolating a particular seg­I  ment from the continuous speech chain. Through this segmen­tation the second property of verse language arises, namely, the density of the verse sequence. The isolation of a metrical segment  i from its linguistic context brings its constitutive elements closer  I together: new connections among them, nonexistent before this  segmentation, are established. This explains "why the quan­ titative content of a verse sequence must be limited . A unit that is  quantitatively excessive either loses its boundaries or itself be­ comes segmented into other units . In both cases, however, it  ceases to be a unit."5 1 The unity and density of the verse se­ quence generate the third feature of verse construction-the dy­ namization of the verbal material. The segmentation of an utter­ ance int� recurring rhythmical units makes the semantic units  similar to each other not only because of their meanings but also  because of their phonic and grammatical features, position in  the line, and so forth . In the progressive-regressive buildup of  l 49. Ibid . ,  p. 34. J  50. Ibid . ,  p. 47. 5 1 .  Ibid . ,  p. 39.  '\ I  191     </page> <page sequence="55"> Russian Formalism  the line , words and their groupings cease to be mere carriers of  infinitely repeatable meanings and turn into heterogeneous en­ tities whose multiple facets are constantly foregrounded in the  ongoing process of rhythmical permutation.  The most difficult to grasp of Tynjanov's four features of  verse construction is the successivity of its verbal material. In the first  place, he opposes it to the simultaneity of the verbal material of  prose. Language is a temporal medium, so the verbal material of  any speech construction must be successive . In Tynjanov's  usage, however, the words "successivity" and "simultaneity" re­ fer not to the medium itself but to the mode of its perception .  In  prose, the dominant set toward semantics prevents us from per­ ceiving the utterance as a process. The successivity of its ele­ ments is there merely to help us grasp the meaning of the utter­ ance in its totality . This perception of wholeness occurs only  after the utterance is finished and we retain all of its elements in  our consciousness as a simultaneous whole . In verse, with its  dynamized verbal material, the goal sought is not a simultaneous  meaning but the sequence itself, the rhythmical unfolding of the  verbal material. Such speech is perceived as a process-a contin­ uous correlation of different facets of language whose hetero­ geneity resists any final semantic summation.  But amazingly , at the same time Tynjanov claims that in prose  "time is perceptible ,"  whereas in verse "time is not perceptible at  all ."52 Here we are confronted by apparent oxymorons : the  "temporal simultaneity" of prose and the "atemporal suc­ cessivity" of verse . This contradictory notion arises from the fact  that Tynjanov was really talking about two different temporal  strata : the temporality involved in the perception of the artistic  medium and the temporality of the extralinguistic semantic  groupings that occur in it. This extralinguistic temporal stratum  is especially important in prose, where such groupings are the  dominant constructive factor. Through a series of gradual se- 52. Ibid . ,  p .  i 1 9 .  </page> <page sequence="56"> A Synecdoche  mantic buildups, the reader constitutes characters and events  whose causal-temporal relations (the story) present one tem­ poral flux. In addition to the indirect experience of temporal  flow presented in the story lfabula) , the reader experiences di­ rectly the flux of the plot (sjuiet) . That the reader is simul­ taneously aware of both of them is apparent in Gogol's short •  story "The Nose," in which the "decelerated . . . n arrative about  the barber Ivan Jakovlevic eating bread and onions produces a  comical effect because too much of the (literary) time is devoted  to it."53 In verse language dominated by rhythm, semantics (in  the broad sehse) is merely a subordinate material . The con­ stitutive elements of verse construction are organized primarily  through their rhythmical permutations, and the experience of  time in the story-plot interaction is largely missing. Moreover,  as these permutations are an ongoing process, there are no  breaks in its perception dividing the temporal continuum into  "now" and "then" points . Every moment is simultaneously a  function of its future (progressive preparation) and its past (the  regressive realization of a previous preparation) . Tynjanov's  claim about the imperceptibility of time in poetry refers there­ fore to the fact that the unfolding of an entire verse construction  takes place in a single perceptual "now" suspended from the  temporal flow.  The discussion of temporal perception in prose and verse  occurs in the second half of Tynjanov's monograph , which is  concerned with the· effects of verse construction on lexical mean­ ing. The fact that he originally planned to call his book The  Problem of Verse Semantics indicates how crucial he considered this  part to be. The nearly six decades that have passed since its  publication have rendered Tynjanov's many revolutionary in­ sights about verse semantics commonplaces in modern literary  scholarship, but within the context of Russian Formalism their  value is unquestionable. And though Tynjanov's metrics often  depended upon discoveries made by other members of the  53. Ibid . 193  </page> <page sequence="57"> Russian Formalism  movement, his study of verse semantics is without any doubt an  original contribution to Formalist poetics .54  Tynjanov's analysis of verse meaning was firmly rooted in his  systemic metaphor, according to which every phenomenon is  relational. For semantics this meant that "it is not necessary to  proceed from the word as the single indivisible element of verbal  art, to regard it as the 'bricks with which an edifice is built . '  This  element is analyzable into much finer 'verbal elements. "'55 Hence,  as with rhythm, verbal meaning is a system of hierarchically  correlated factors-semantic features.  The first distinction Tynjanov drew was that between the  "basic feature" and the "secondary features" of semantics. A  basic feature is a general lexical category common to all the  usages of a word and hence guaranteeing its semantic identity .  This identity is purely semantic, for though homophones share  the same outer form, they do not share their basic semantic  feature. Drawing a parallel with phonology, Tynjanov saw the  "concept of the basic feature in semantics as analogous to that of  the phoneme."56  The secondary features of meaning can be divided into the  "vacillating" and the "steady. "  The former are a function of the  immediate linguistic context in which the word appears . Every  speech construction semantically colors the words which com­ pose it by furnishing them with (slightly) different connota­ tions. Steady secondary features are a function of a broader  social context: the milieu from which the word comes (slangs,  dialects , and so forth) .  Tynjanov calls it the "lexical coloring of  the word" and claims that it is "discernible only outside the activity  and situation which it characterizes. " Finally , in synthetic languages  like Russian, words are usually composed of two parts : the "ref- 54. This, of course, does not mean that Tynjanov's semantic theory is without  any intellectual predecessors.

The unity and density of the verse sequence is perhaps  the most obvious cause of such a semantic shift. In a verse con­ struction the rhythmical and semantic divisions need not coin­ cide, and syntactically related words may be separated by metri­ cal bou11daries. Enjambment is a case in point. A word separated  from its context and incorporated into a metrical sequence gains  strong new connotations because of the density of the sequence.  An interaction of rhythm and semantics also occurs within  segments smaller than the line, for example, feet and syllables.  If  a line is composed of words whose boundaries coincide with  foot boundaries, every word turns into a rhythmical unit (a foot)  and its syntactic relation to other words weakens . Such word-feet  tend to be perceived as if in isolation, so that their basic semantic  features are intensified . 58 Caesura, an obligatory word bound­ ary after a particular syllable, is another rhythmical division ca­ pable of interfering with semantics if, for example, the concomi­ tant intonational pause divides words that are syntactically  closely related. Thus , in Lermontov's line  No ne s toboj I ja serdcem govorju  (But not to  you I with my heart I speak)  such a pause (accompanied by a seeming parallelism of the two  hemistychs) even leads to a misreading (a "secondary semasio­ logization" in Tynjanov's terms), attested to by the fact that two  years after the poet's death this line was printed as :  No ne s toboj , I -ja s serdcem govorju  57 · Ibid . ,  pp .  56-57 ;  p. 58 ;  p. 56.  58.

It  results from the strong influence of liturgical Church Slavonic  on literary Russian. Lomonosov's linguistic reform of the eigh­ teenth century and his theory of three styles identified the high  style with the use of Church Slavonic vocabulary . Although in  modern Russian this factor has decreased considerably, there  are still many cases in which a poet can play on the synonymity  or homonymity of Russian and Church Slavonic words. Lexical  coloring can even become a dominant semantic feature when  the Church Slavonic word is no longer understandable to the  reader but still carries the lofty, liturgical connotations belong­ ing to that tongue. Vocabulary drawn from other foreign lan­ guages, proper names characterizing foreign cultures , or even  Russian words connected to a particular region, trade, or milieu  fulfill a similar function.  All of them foreground secondary fea­ tures in the words with which they comprise a verse sequence.  In addition to the semantic features that I have discussed so  far, the word consists of referential and formal parts . Their  relation, or more precisely, the change in this relation caused by  rhythm, is equally important for verse semantics. Here second­ ary rhythmical factors-sound repetition and rhyme-play a  central role . Needless to say, for Tynjanov these devices are  complex phenomena, and in studying them he takes into ac­ count the proximity of repeated sounds and rhymes, their rela­ tionship to meter, the quantity and quality of the sounds uti­ lized, the part of the word in which they occur, and the general  character of the word. 50  Sound repetitions affect lexical meaning in many ways, for  instance , through the mimetic and expressive sound patterns  that the early Formalists found espec!ally intriguing.

Ibid . ,  pp. 102 and 1 09 .   196  </page> <page sequence="60"> A Synecdoche  however, was less interested in this direct link between the phon­ ic and semantic aspects of individual words than in their rela­ tionship in words interlocked in a verse sequence . For example,  his commentary on the line  Unylaja pora, ocej ocarovan 'e  (Doleful time, the charm of eyes)  provides a good explanation of this phenomenon. " 'Ocej ocaro­ van' e' is a group united both metrically and phonically, and we  perceive the sounds ocej, oea- as comparable . This perception  involves two successive moments : the recognition in the word  ocarovan ' e [charm] of an element from the previous word and the  uniting of the two words into a group. In this , the referential  l part of the word ocarovan ' e becomes colored through its strong linkage to the referential part of ocej [eyes] . It  is as if the first stage in the redistribution of the referential and formal parts . . .  had taken place, in this case, as though we derived ocarovan' e from the  t root oci. "6 1 l Obviously, sound repetitions need not be limited to con­l tiguous words. They may permeate an entire verse construction ;  by  rendering words phonically similar they dynamize their ver­l  bal material, and through a regressive movement make this ma­terial successive . Summing up the role of sound repetition in verse semantics , Tynjanov wrote that its "evocation of the vac­illating features of meaning (through the redistribution of the  l referential and formal parts of the word) and transformation of the utterance into an amalgamated, correlated whole, cause me  to view them as a particular kind of rhythmical metaphor. "62  The role of rhyme in verse semantics is to some degree similar  to that of sound repetition .  There are, however, certain dif­ ferences between the two, the stronger progressive force of  rhyme being the most important. Because of the anticipation  raised by the first rhyming member, rhyme is capable of de- 6 i .  Ibid . ,  p. 1 07 .   62 .

Put differently, the very play  on the fulfillment or frustration of expectations in an actual  rhyme can of itself motivate the unfolding of a lyrical "plot"  outside of any story. The poem seems to come about only as an  exercise in rhyming. Moreover, because of their fixed positions,  rhyming words tend to retain their relative independence : they  do not interpenetrate or amalgamate as do words in a sound  repetition. "The moment of juxtaposition, comparison, " wrote  Tynjanov, "is so important that I view rhyme as a particular kind  of rhythmical simile with a partial change in the rhyming mem­ ber's basic feature or the foregrounding of its vacillating fea­ tures. I ts significance as a powerful semantic lever is beyond any  doubt."63  Tynjanov's The Problem of Verse Language was the most signifi­ cant criticism of the early OPOJAZ notion of poetic language  and the linguistic model that underlies it. Yet, despite such for­ midable opposition, the linguistic model and its key notion of  poetic language did not vanish from Formalist discourse. Quite  the contrary : this synecdoche not only survived the movement  that spawned it, but after receiving a powerful boost from  Prague Structuralism during the thirties and forties, continued  into the present day. The reemergence of this theoretical model  after its OPOJAZ critique was the work of the second wing of the  Formalist movement whose institutionalized center was the  Moscow Linguistic Circle. In particular, the genius of the vice­ chairman of this group, Roman Jakobson, invested the linguistic  model with a depth and sophistication that it had lacked in the  early days of OPOJAZ. We now arrive at the complex topic of  Jakobsonian poetics .  63.

In July of  i 920 he left Russia for Czechoslovakia, and with the exception  of a handful of articles all his major works were published out­ side his native land. His stay abroad, which only subsequently  turned into permanent exile, did not in the beginning preclude  scholarly or personal contact with the Formalists he had left  behind. His works were read in Russia and his ideas had an  impact on several members of the movement. But the scholarly  and political situation in Bohemia was quite different from that  of Russia, and as time passed the difference grew. By the late  twenties all the other Formalists discussed so far had yielded to  Epigraph: When I say : "a flower!"  then from that forgetfulness to which my  voice consigns all floral form, something different from the usual calyces arises,  something all music, essence, and softness : the flower which is absent from all  bouquets (Quoted from Mallarme: Selected Prose Poems, Essays, and Letters, ed. and  tr. B. Cook [Baltimore, i 956] ) .   199  </page> <page sequence="63"> Russian Formalism  official pressure and abandoned either their scholarly careers or  their earlier theoretical views, whereas Jakobson's intellectual  history does not contain any such caesura. This is not to say that  his ideas stood still . In fact, as his research progressed, his ap­ proach to linguistics and poetics evolved into a wholly new schol­ arly paradigm that in i 929 he christened "Structuralism."  1 This development, unlike that of his former comrades, was not the  result of an abrupt leap that negated an earlier position; rather,  it was a series of gradual changes-an expansion of intellectual  horizons �nd a shift in theoretical emphasis.  I t  is this very continuity in Jakobson's thought that makes my  account of it rather difficult. Because of its organic develop­ ment, it is impossible to pinpoint with any precision the moment  at which jakobson's Formalist period ended and his Structuralist  phase began. And while it is obvious that his linguistic model was  an integral part of the Russian movement, it is equally indisputa­ ble that a refined version of it informed Structuralist poetics as  well . For these reasons, if I am to remain within the strict limits  of my topic of Russian Formalism, I cannot treat Jakobson's  approach to verbal art adequately ; yet any serious attempt at a  full analysis will lead me far astray.  To escape this dilemma, my treatment of the Jakobsonian  model will be somewhat more arbitrary than that of the others I  have discussed . As a way of stressing the Formalist quality of  J akobson's notion of poetic language I shall focus on his booklet  on Chlebnikov "written in May, i 9 1 9 , in Moscow as an introduc­ tion to Chlebnikov's Collected Works in preparation" and pub­ lished some two years later in Prague.2 The Chlebnikov book  contains in nuce most of Jakobson's ideas about verbal art, but as  it is not a full-fledged theory of literature but only a preliminary  sketch (nabrosok) ,  I shall extract from it the basic principles that  came to underlie Jakobson's "literary science."  At the same time,  because many of the notions vaguely hinted at in the Chlebnikov  I .  "Romanticke vseslovanstvi-nov� slavistika," Cin I ( 1 929) ,  1 1.  2. N. S.

As Elmar Holenstein has argued persuasively, among the in­ tellectual movements that shaped Jakobson's theoretical out­ look, Husserlian phenomenology occupied an especially promi­ nent position. Jakobson's acquaintance with this subject dated  back to his student days at Moscow University in the mid-teens,  as shown in the epistemological assumptions behind his earliest  project in the new literary science. His conception of literary  studies closely parallels the procedures of eidetic phenomenol­ ogy, which in Holenstein's account "is concerned with the grasp  of the essential features common to objects of the same catego­ ry. "3 Accordingly, Jakobson believed that the literary scholar  should bracket off the phenomenal heterogeneity of poetic  works and focus on the underlying essence that endows them  with their categorical identity. As he succinctly put it, "the object  of literary science is not literature but literariness , i .e . ,  what  makes a given work a literary work."4  Jakobson's conception of this eidos yielded the first principle of  his new poetics. It  is the "set [ustanovka] toward expression," he  wrote, "that I designate as the only factor essential for poetry."5  Holenstein calls this principle "phenomenological" in that it  defines poetry in terms of a perceiver's mental set, thus follow­ ing the basic premise of phenomenology that no object can be  studied "in itself' but only as it is apperceived by an experienc­ ing or observing subject.6 As we have seen, however, both  Tomasevskij and Tynjanov advocated that the study of verse  3.

Thus, if I  were to follow Holenstein's suggestion fully I would have to  extend the label "phenomenological" to designate their metrical  studies as well . However, for me, what is phenomenological in  Jakobson's formulation is not the mental set alone but its qualifi­ cation as the "set toward expression. " That Jakobson himself con­ sidered this qualification crucial is obvious from his suggestion  that his method of literary study be called "expressionist. "7 It  would seem vital, then, to approach the phenomenological  nature of Jakobson's poetics through the concept of the  express10n.  The expression (Ausdruck) ,  a notion that Husserl advanced  with great rigor in "Investigation I" of his Logical Investigations,  served as the cornerstone of his search for a universalist semiotic  theory. For Husserl , only a repeatable sign, a sign that retains its  essential self-sameness under all circumstances, can serve as a  vehicle of logical thought capable of embodying truth. The psy­ chologistic and physicalistic doctrines of representation preva­ lent in his day failed to account for the ideal nature of the logical  sign. By reducing it to a mere representamen of the mental  states it indicates or the objectivities it denotes they opened the  sign's identity to the vicissitudes of the phenomenal world. Radi­ cally stated, if every significative act posits the sign in a new and  unrepeatable spatiotemporal nexus, each of these acts inevitably  turns the sign into a unique, nonidentical event.  To avoid the relativism inherent in all naturalistic semiot­ ics , Husserl divided signs into two incompatible categories : ( i )   the expression, identified as "each instance or part o f  speech"  and "each sign . . . e ssentially of the same sort" that are capable  of remaining self-same regardless of the actual context ; and ( 2 )   the indication (Anzeichen) , which i s  any sign lacking such identity  and hence merely representing a fluctuating state of affairs.8  7 .

Thus , Husserl was forced to analyze the internal structure  of the expression to discover a factor resistant to contextual  change. "In the case of a name [for example], we distinguish  between what it 'shows forth' (i .e . ,  a mental state) and what it  means. And again between what it means (the sense or 'content'  of its naming presentation) and what it names (the object of that  presentation) . "9 Both the "showing forth" and the "naming" are  contingent upon empirical reality and thus cannot retain their  sameness in repetition. Only the "content of an expression's  naming presentation," the "meaning" (Bedeutung) of the lin­ guistic sign, is independent of the phenomenal context. It is  therefore this lexical meaning inherent in the word prior to its  representing other entities that endows the expression with its  identity and distinguishes it from the indication.  This distinction has a direct bearing on J akobson's probe into  the essence of verbal art. To the three functions of the name­ showing forth, naming, and meaning--c- orrespond Jakobson's  three goal-oriented verbal activities,  or more precisely,  func­ tional dialects-the emotive, the practical , and the poetic. He  argued against the claims of F. T. Marinelli, the leader of the  Italian Futurists , that their experiments in poetry were in fact  perfect vehicles for the modern sensibility. Jakobson agreed that  "in both emotive and poetic language, linguistic representations  (both phonetic and semantic) attract attention to themselves ; the  bond between sound and meaning in them is closer, more inti­ mate ."  However, "these facts exhaust what emotive and poetic  language have in common." 1 ° For Jakobson, emotive language  was a clear-cut case of the communicative use of language. By  intimating a speaker's mental state, an emotive utterance refers  g. Ibid . ,  p. 2 76.  IO .  Novejfaja russkaja poezija, p. IO .   2 03  </page> <page sequence="67"> Russian Fo nnalism  to a phenomenal entity very much as practical language speaks  of an objective state of affairs . But "the poetic word is to a  certain degree objectless" ;  it "lacks what Husserl terms dinglicher  Bezug. "11 Poetic language stands apart from the other two func­ tional dialects because the "communicative function inherent in  practical and emotive language is minimal in it." Thus , "poetry,  which is nothing but an utterance set toward the expression, is gov­ erned by its own immanent laws . " 1 2  The suspension of representation in verbal art profoundly  affects the way the poetic utterance operates. Whereas in its  communicative function the word is a mere transparent vehicle  for the signification of other, nonlinguistic entities, in poetry the  word itself, its internal structure, occupies center stage. Grigorij  Vinokur-another influential member of the Moscow Linguistic  Circle-drew attention to this fact. "A poetic creation," he  claimed, "is work with a word that is no longer a mere sign but a  thing endowed with its own structure, whose elements are re­ evaluated and regrouped in every new poetic utterance . . . .  if  the communicative function makes social intercourse possible  through the word, the poetic function informs the perceiver  about the very structure of the word, shows him the elements  that compose its structure, enriches his mind with knowledge of  a new object-the word. The poetic function tells us through the  word what the word is, whereas through the other functions of  the word we learn about objects ontologically different from the  word : other functions tell us through the word about something  else ." 1 3   Jakobson's conversion o f  the Husserlian expression from a  logical to an aesthetic category was unorthodox, to say the least,  and generated certain problems that had to be solved as his  I I .

By ren­ dering the expression the key notion in his poetics, Jakobson  staked out the territory of this discipline beyond the two oppos­ ing camps of contemporary Russian literary study. The ex­ pressionist model rejected the transrational theory of poetic lan­ guage propounded by early OPOJAZ, but avoided slipping into  the pre-Formalist notion of the literary work as an undistorted  mirror of either the poet's soul or the social reality it depicted .  With the expressionist model Jakobson could deny that the art­ work was a mere psychological or sociological document without  implying that it was therefore devoid of meaning. If poetry, as  another critic of the transrational model , Jurij Tynjanov, wrote,  "does not operate . . . w ith the word but with the expression, "  meaning is still always a component of its structure. 1 5  Earlier I suggested that the theoretical gulf between the Pe­ tersburg and Moscow Formalists on the issue of poetic language  corresponds in some degree to the two notions of zaum' among  the Futurists . For Krucenych, who inspired the founding mem­ bers of OPOJAZ, transrational language was an attempt at liber­ ating linguistic sound from the yoke of rationality ; for Chleb­ nikov, the subject of Jakobson's first book, it was a return to an  original language of pure rationality . "It is possible to say,"  Chlebnikov argued, "that everyday language is the shadow of  14 .  Although Jakobson's definition of  verbal art proved to be  quite workable  for distinguishing poetic language from its emotive and practical counterparts,  because of its origin in logic it tended to obliterate the difference between poetic  language and another functional dialect which Jakobson later termed "meta­ language." Viktor Sklovskij , for example, when analyzing authorial meta­ discourse in Don Quixote, viewed it as a manifestation of the "set toward 'ex­ pression' which is so typical in art" ("Kak sdelan Don-Kichot," 0 teorii prozy  [Moscow, 1 925] ,  p. 85). Thus Jakobson and some other Prague Structuralists  were eventually forced to come up with a secondary criterion to distinguish the  metalinguistic from the poetic set toward expression; see, for example, J .

" 1 6   And the proper domicile o f  this pure word, as h e  observed  elsewhere, is the human mind : "besides the language of words  there is a mute language of concepts composed of mental units  (a tissue of concepts governing the language of words) . " 1 7 Or, in  an anthropomorphic metaphor, "the word is a face with a hat  tilted over it. The rational [myslimoe] in it precedes the verbal , the  aural . " 1 8 From Chlebnikov's standpoint, therefore, verbal art as  the art of the word is forever caught in the conceptual web  generated by rationality , is always permeated with cognitive  meanmgs.  Such a view of verbal art, however, has in recent years become  somewhat unpopular. It exhibits what the French philosopher,  Jacques Derrida, calls a "logocentric" bias, for it conceives of the  linguistic sign as an instrument of reason. This bias , Derrida  argues, has its roots in the "Western metaphysics of presence,"   which forged the image of the sign as  an instance of logos, the  signification of Truth . Whatever Chlebnikov's reasons might  have been for elevating rational meaning in the verbal parcel,  Jakobson's seem somewhat less metaphysical than Derrida  would suggest. They stem from another conviction of his-un­ expected perhaps, given his phenomenological orientation­ that literature is a social institution, a consensus among the  members of a particular collectivity. Jakobson believed that po­ etic works are intersubjective signs involving some form of ra­ tionality which he conceptualized as the (imperfect) sharing of  cognitive meanings. The OPOJAZ theorists who emphasized the  transrational components of poetic language (the emotive and  so forth) had in J akobson's opinion lost sight of the social nature  of verbal art. His i 92 2  comparison of the Moscow and Pe­ tersburg branches of the Formalist movement makes this point  unequivocally : "Whereas the former [the Moscow branch] ar­ gues that the historical development of artistic forms has a so- 1 6.

" 1 9  Thus, accepting Derrida's  notion of the "instituted trace"20 as a substitute for the concept  of the sign (damaged beyond repair by its millennia-long mar­ riage to the Western metaphysics of presence) ,  one might say  that Jakobson's "logocentrism" stems at least in part from his  taking too seriously the fact that the trace is instituted. For what  else does the act of instituting a trace achieve but some form of  presence, that is, a consensus among those whose vested power  or interest enables them to promulgate one trace as opposed to  another and those who recognize the others' efforts as an accom­ plished fact? Anyone like Jakobson, who had experienced revo­ lution and civil war, would be well aware of the brutal force by  which such a consensus is brought about.2 1  Physically enforced  presence hardly qualifies as metaphysical .  Rejecting the social determinism of pre-Formalist literary the­ ory, but maintaining nevertheless that literature is essentially  social , Jakobson formulated a rather unusual view of "literary  sociology."  Here the second, "linguistic ," principle of the ex­ pressionistic model becomes relevant. This principle projects the  social dimension of literature into its linguistic material . If verbal  art, in contrast to communicative discourse, directs our attention  to the internal structure of language, poetic forms are above all  linguistic forms. Thus, in Jakobson's words, "poetry is language  in its aesthetic function."22 Because language is for him the so­ cial institution par excellence-a set of rules obligatory for the  members of a particular speech community-verbal art cannot  1 9.

"The theory of poetic language," Jakobson declared,  "can be developed only if poetry is treated as a social fact, if a  poetic dialectology of its own kind is established ."23  To appreciate Jakobson's linguistic model fully it is necessary  to introduce his overall concept of language. The great Swiss  linguist, Ferdinand de Saussure, exerted the most decisive influ­ ence on the young Jakobson. As Jakobson recollected in 1 956,  he gained his first insights into Saussurean linguistics through  Saussure's student Sergej Karcevskij , "who in 1 9 1 7- 1 9 1 9, dur­ ing his short-lived return to Russia, fired the young generation  of Moscow linguists with the Cours de linguistique generate. "24  Jakobson would have found Saussure's theory of language  especially stimulating because the main problem it tackled-the  identity of the linguistic sign:_was also the central theme of  Husserl's "Investigation I . "  The solution the Swiss linguist had  to offer was, however, quite different. We have seen that Hus­ serl found the meaning of the expression to be the vehicle of its  sameness .  But this step only raised the further question, "what is  the nature of that meaning?" To answer it Husserl was forced,  first, to come up with a situation in which the word would func­ tion as a pure meaning free of any indicative relations, and then  to account for the self-sameness of meaning in repetition, its  identity in every actual situation belonging under this heading.  He fixed on the mental soliloquy to meet the first condition. In  an interior monologue the subject knows what he means ; his  words do not serve him as indicators of his thought. Instead , in  the directly experienced unity of the significatory act, the mean­ ing of the expression merges with the subject's meaning-inten­ tion. This , however, does not imply that for Husserl meaning  was a totally subjective entity : if it were, meaning would dissipate  into a multiplicity of meaning-intending acts and so would lack  any essential sameness. In addition to its intuitive presence in  one's consciousness , meaning had to exist intersubjectively for  23. Ibid . ,  p. 5. 24.

All subjective  meaning-intentions would thus be merely tokens of a type, their  identity being the ideal self-sameness of the members of a class .   What connects the Swiss linguist to the German philosopher is   Saussure's mentalist stance. The starting point of Saussure's  "semiology" was not the word in its physical existence but its  representation in the subject's consciousness .  The two con­ stitutive elements of the linguistic sign (the signifier and the  signified) are not the actual sound and referent whose mate­ riality renders them unique, but instead infinitely repeatable  mental representations-the "sound image" and the "concept. "  Like Husserl, Saussure is not a subjectivist, for such a stance  would subvert the issue of semiotic identity from the very start.  But unlike Husserl, who relegated the intersubjective sameness  of the sign to the ideal realm of universal objects , Saussure  sought it in the social nature of language.   The basic postulate of Saussurean linguistics is  that every phe­ nomenon of language has a strictly dualistic existence. On the  one hand, it is a component of an actual utterance by an indi­ vidual speaker (parole) , and on the other it is an element within  the potential and socially shared system of language (langue) .  Concrete utterances are nothing but particularized instances of  the preexistent system, its implementations in physical, hetero­ geneous matter. In its purely material being every utterance  inevitably differs, if ever so slightly, from any other one ; there­ fore the sameness of a linguistic sign cannot be a fact of parole.  The situation, however, is radically different with langue. It is  a homogeneous system of purely linguistic relations devoid of  any physical substance, sheer form articulating sound images  and concepts into linguistic units . The value of every such unit is  precisely circumscribed by its incorporation into this differential  grid . Moreover, though entirely conventional, at any given mo­ ment langue is fixed and obligatory for all users of a language.  Thus, the sameness of the linguistic sign, which cannot be dis­ cerned in its manifold material manifestations, is a function of  </page> <page sequence="73"> Russian Formalism  the linguistic system. The sign retains its identity through repeti­ tions only because each of its occurrences is an embodiment of  the self-same unit of langue. Needless to say, for Saussure the  science of language should concern itself solely with this internal  system of language. Eschewing the traditional preoccupation of  linguists with cultural or natural phenomena contingent upon  language, he declared : "the true and unique object of linguistics is  language studied in and for itself. "25  Though he accepted Saussure's postulate of the social nature  of language, Jakobson was quite uneasy about the abstract char­ acter Saussure ascribed to it. From his point of view, the trace­ to return once more to Derrida's terminology-is never in­ stituted at random but rather for some particular purpose. In  other words,  language, he believed, i s  preeminently a means­ end structure allowing the user to achieve particular goals.  Earlier I mentioned a similar notion of language advocated by  the Petersburger Jakubinskij . The two Formalists differed in an  important respect, however. For Jakubinskij ,  the classification of  utterances according to telos was only a heuristic device, possible  but definitely not the exclusive possibility . For Jakobson, in con­ trast, language existed in no other mode than as a means to a  particular end, so that the teleological view was the only one  possible . Furthermore, in accord with the strict binary structure  of his transrational model, Jakubinskij recognized only two  functional dialects-practical language, in which sounds are  mere means , and poetic language, in which they are ends. This  bifurcation of language was unacceptable to Jakobson because it  juxtaposed sound and meaning as two incompatible phenome­ na. His own classification (inspired by Husserl) proceeded from  the actual speech situation, allotting an appurtenant function to  each of the indispensable components of the situation-the  speaker, the referent, and the sign . For Jakobson, sound and  meaning coexist in every functional dialect; only their rela­ tionship is a variable.  25. Course in General Linguistics, tr. and ed. W. Baskin (New York, 1 959), p. 232 .   2 10  </page> <page sequence="74"> A Synecdoche  Maintaining his means-end model for better or for worse,  Jakobson challenged Saussure's credo that linguistics was con­ cerned solely with language "in and for itself." "Language," Jak­ obson argued , "according to the correct definition of contempo­ rary French linguists , is a system of conventional values, very  much like a pack of cards . But because of this, it would be wrong  to analyze it without taking into account the multiplicity of possi­ ble tasks without which the system does not exist. Just as we have  no rules for a universal card game valid equally for rummy,  poker, and card-house building, linguistic rules can be deter­ mined only for a system defined by its goal . "26 What is under  attack here is not langue per se, but Saussure's notion of it as a  homogeneous system uniformly governing each and every ut­ terance. Instead, Jakobson conceives of language as a set of  functional dialects each with its own system of rules structured  in the way best suited to its specific goals.  Of course, the division of langue into functional dialects pre­ sents some problems of its own, the unity of the national lan­ guage being perhaps the most important. It would seem reason­ able to argue, for instance, that a Russian poem has more in  common with utterances belonging to other Russian functional  dialects than with a poem, let us say, in English . To account for  this unity in variety, Vinokur proposed a modification of Saus­ sure's rigid dualism of langue and parole. Between the social sys­ tem of a language and its individual utterances, he posited sets  of "stylistic" norms, each governing one particular type of goal­ oriented verbal behavior. These norms, pertaining only to spe­ cific usages of a language, are less general than the norms of  langue, but at the same time they are shared by at least some  speakers of a language. Like langue, they are social .  Viewed through this conceptual prism, every utterance, poetic  or otherwise, is simultaneously governed by two normative sys­ tems : a general langue and a particular style . "The word taken as  26.

"Taken in itself, of course, each empirically concrete utterance  (poetic ones included) is asocial. But the point is that stylistics in  general and poetics in particular study these concrete utterances  as elements of a specific system that is superimposed upon the  system of language proper. An utterance is an individual, cre­ ative, volitional act. But several of these acts are no longer mere­ ly a sum total of individual acts but a system endowed with a  purpose, a significance , that is generally valid within perhaps  narrow, yet surely social, limits . This system of poetic utterances  is, in fact, the genuine object of poetics."28  Although Jakobson did not at first discuss the unity of func­ tional dialects as fully as Vinokur, his occasional statements on  the subject reveal a more critical attitude toward Saussure. He  rejected the notion of a homogeneous langue equally imple­ mented in every utterance, instead conceiving of a national lan­ guage as a "system of systems," a hierarchically organized struc­ ture of functional dialects each with its own langue. Within such  a structure, each dialect is only relatively autonomous. Practical  language is the most basic or, according to Jakobson's later ter­ minology, the unmarked dialect. Every member of the speech  community is inevitably competent in it, for through it one com­ municates one's everyday business. As the most universal func­ tional dialect, practical language creates the background against  which the utterances of all other dialects are perceived. As Jak­ obson argued in the Prague Linguistic Circle's i929  "Theses,"   "From a synchronic standpoint, poetic language has the form of  27 . "Poetika, lingvistika, sociologija ," 1 09. 28. Ibid . ,  1 1 1 .  2 1 2   </page> <page sequence="76"> A Synecdoche  a poetic utterance (parole) and hence of an individual creative act  evaluated both against the backdrop of the immediate poetic  tradition (poetic langue) and against that of the contemporary  practical [sdelovaci] language."29  A poetic utterance is perceived against the background of  practical language because the two are functional dialects and  not foreign languages. They share most of their linguistic ele­ ments and mechanisms, differing only in their methods of ex­ ploiting them. Arguing against J akubinskij's definition of poetic  language as a particular phonetic feature, Jakobson wrote, "The  clustering of liquids is possible in both practical and poetic lan­ guage, but in the former it is causal whereas in the latter . . .  [it  is] goal-oriented ; i .e . ,  they are two essentially different phe­ nomena. "30 At this point, the concept of the "device" enters  Jakobson's critical vocabulary. The clustering of liquids and  other striking organizations of verbal material in poetry are not,  as in other linguistic processes, mere accidents , but means to a  specific end . They disrupt the communicative function of the  verbal sign and in this way redirect attention from the subjective  or objective realities signified to the internal structure of the sign  itself. The langue of poetic language, the "immanent laws" gov­ erning this dialect, can thus be seen as a system of poetic devices .  Hence Jakobson's oft-quoted slogan that "if the science of liter­ ature wishes to become scientific it must recognize the 'device' as  its sole 'hero . '  "3 1  This statement obviously suggests Sklovskij 's mechanistic met­ aphor, in which the device, if not the sole hero, was definitely  one of the main protagonists . The affinity between Sklovskij and  Jakobson here is undeniable ; however, there are several impor- 29.

To maintain  Jakobson's earlier nomenclature I have translated "sdelovaci" as "practical" in­ stead of the more correct "communicative. "  By the late twenties, however, Jak­ obson expanded his functional dialectology and "practical language" became a  subcategory of the more general "communicative language."  30. 0 cesskom stiche preimu.Scestvenno v sopostavlenii s russkim (Berlin, i 923) ,  p. i 7. 3 i .

One of these, concerning  the linguistic versus extralinguistic nature of the artistic device,  was discussed in the preceding chapter. A second difference is  that for Sklovskij , the device functioned to de-familiarize, and  hence was crucial to the process of artistic perception. For Jak­ obson, however, the devi�e was important to the process of artis­ tic signification:  a poetic utterance de-familiarizes language be­ cause of its peculiar semiotic status, because it does not refer in  the manner of communicative utterances. Finally, the two For­ malists approached the device with different epistemological  economies. Sklovskij clearly multiplied the entities designated as  devices , cataloguing as many different varieties as possible . Jak­ obson,  in accord with his general phenomenological orientation,  was decidedly reductivist. Rather than describing the manifold  heterogeneity of poetic devices he strove to isolate a few elemen­ tary structuring principles implemented in all of them.  What are these basic principles that govern every poetic utter­ ance? Because the "set toward expression" renders prominent  the internal structure of the word, verbal art operates with the  constitutive elements of this structure-phonic and prosodic fac­ tors, morphemes of all types, semantic features-which play  only a subsidiary role in communicative language. From this  point of view, poetic praxis is the restructuring of an utterance  to bring to the foreground the constitutive elements of lan­ guage. This goal is achieved through two correlated processes :  the uncoupling of the speech chain into its basic linguistic ele­ ments, and their reassemblage into new patterns determined by  some form of equivalence. As Jakobson wrote, "in poetry, the  role of mechanical associations is minimized, for the dissociation  of verbal elements is the exclusive goal. The dissociated frag­ ments are [then] easily regrouped into new combinations ."32  This view was subsequently reiterated by Vinokur, for whom  the "specificity of the poetic tendency" in language "ultimately  boils down to the dissolution of a linguistic structure into its  32 .  Ibid . ,  p. 4 i .   </page> <page sequence="78"> A Synecdoche  elements , which are then recombined. But here, in contrast to  the language system proper, the relations among the parts are  reshuffled and displaced and thus the very significance, the valency,  the linguistic value of these constitutive parts are laid bare and precisely  calculated. "33  This dual process of analysis and resynthesis operates, accord­ ing to Jakobson, at all levels of poetic language. Analysis occurs  in such devices as the rhythmical splitting of the word, poetic  etymologizing, and "accentual dissimilation," that is, the reac­ centuation of a word or the juxtaposition of accentual doublets .  Resynthesis is implemented in such devices as "rhyme, asso­ nance and alliteration (or repetition)" and "all forms of paral­ lelism : partial parallelism-the simile ; parallelism unfolding in  time-the metamorphosis ; [and] parallelism reduced to a  point-the metaphor. "34  The poetic restructuring of an utterance not only affects the  individual strata of language, but establishes new relations  among them. Most importantly it realigns the link between  sound and meaning. Throughout this chapter I have noted the  keen interest of the Formalists in the similarity of poetic sound  to what it signifies . Jakobson was no exception. He also believed  that in poetic language "the link between sound and meaning is  closer, more intimate . . . i nsofar as the habitual associations  based on contiguity retreat to the background."35 Earlier we saw  OPOJAZ's preoccupation with expressive and mimetic sound  metaphors and Tynjanov's study of the semantic amalgamation  of similar sounding words within a verse line. Jakobson de­ scribed yet another similarity between the phonic and semantic  aspects of poetic language, which might be characterized as the  thematization of sound . It occurs when the phonic structure of  several semantically disparate words is repeated in the key word  of an utterance. A Russian proverb mentioned by Jakobson is a  good illustration:  33 . "Poetika, lingvistika, sociologija," 1 09. 34. Novejsaja russkaja poezija, pp. 47-48.  35 · Ibid . ,  P· JO .   2 15  </page> <page sequence="79"> Russian Formalism  Sila solomu !omit  (Power breaks the straw)  Here "two members of a construction intersect in the third  one ."36 The key word soloma (straw) contains both the conso­ nants of the initial word sila (power) and the root of the final  verb lomit (breaks) .  This sound equivalence creates a semantic  rapprochement among the words composing the sequence .  The poetic restructuring of an utterance not only disrupts its  communicative function, but affects poetic perception through a  third principle of expressionist poetics, which might be called  "Futurist" (in accord with Holenstein's terminology) .37 The  nonreferential poetic word transforms our attitude to language ;  it makes what seemed intimately familiar into something strange  and unknown. According to the "Futurist" principle, the dis­ tinctive feature of verbal art as a type of linguistic behavior is  that it de-familiarizes language and renders its forms unusual.  Like Sklovskij ,  Jakobson insisted that poetic "form exists only  insofar as we feel it, as we sense the resistance of the material, as  we wonder whether we face prose or verse."38 Hence de-famil­ iarization is a historical process in which all three dimensions of  time interpenetrate. As the "unknown is comprehensible and  striking only against the background of the known,"39 so de­ familiarization necessarily involves the past: the old automatized  forms that serve as a backdrop to the new perception.  At the  same time, the novelty of the present poetic forms is merely  transitory. "There comes a time,"  wrote Jakobson, "when tradi­ tional poetic language ossifies, ceases to be palpable and be­ comes outlived like a ritual or a sacred text whose very lapses are  considered holy . . . . t he form masters the material, the material  becomes fully dominated by its form, the form turns into a ster- 36. Ibid . ,  p. 5 1 .  For a more detailed discussion of this proverb see Jakobson's essay, "Quest for the Essence of Language," Diogenes 5 1  ( 1 965), 32-33.   37 .

Yet this future de-famil­ iarization is contrastively related to the forms now becoming  automatized, and these present forms, as the cause of the subse­ quent development, contain the seeds of the future within them.  Moreover, Jakobson held that de-familiarization takes place  not among isolated poetic phenomena but among phenomena  integrated into structures corresponding to literary schools ,  groups, movements, or even individuals . Thus, like langue, the  system of poetic language is not homogeneous. Rather, it com­ prises various subsystems interlocked in an ongoing historical  struggle. Jakobson describes this process in terms of geograph­ ical linguistics.  "From this point of view, Puskin is the center of  the poetic culture of a particular time with a particular zone of  influence. The poetic dialects of one zone gravitating toward the  cultural center of another can be subdivided, like the dialects of  practical language, into : transitional dialects, dialects with a·  transitory tendency, and mixed dialects . The first have adopted  a group of canons from the center toward which they gravitate ;  the second have adopted certain poetic tendencies from it; and  the third, only individual heterogeneous elements-devices. Fi­ nally, one must take into account conservative archaic dialects ,  whose centers of gravity belong to the past ."4 1  The de-familiarization of language is not fully exhausted by  the interaction of old and new poetic forms. I noted previously  that in the expressionist model, poetic language is closely related  to another functional dialect-practical language . Within this  dialect too a historical clash goes on between the conservative  tendency of standard literary language to preserve traditional  forms and the innovative tendency within living colloquial  speech to generate new ones. Russian poets , according to Jakob­ son, have always exploited the creative potential of colloquial  speech for the sake of de-familiarization. "From Simeon Polockij  4� lb�d. 4 1 .  Ibid . ,  pp .  5-6.  2 1 7   </page> <page sequence="81"> Russian Formalism  on, through Lomonosov, Derfavin, Puskin, Nekrasov, and Ma­ jakovskij , Russian poetry has continuously adopted newer and  newer elements of the living language . "42 Raw, uncultivated col­ loquialisms replace old poetisms-turned-cliches to render the  medium of verbal art vivid once again.  The Futurist principle introduces another facet denied by  Saussure into the language system: time. In Saussure's Course,  langue is defined as atemporal, and linguistic change as asys­ temic. The motivation for this decision is obvious :  concern over  the identity of the sign. Once different stages of langue are in­ cluded in one system, the precise value of linguistic units is com­ promised. By functioning simultaneously in different relational  grids,  their identity becomes ambiguous. Moreover, Saussure  maintained that the impulse for change came not from within  the homogeneous system of language, but only from without it,  through the accidental destructive intervention of extra­ linguistic factors . Therefore he split the science of language into  its synchronic and diachronic branches and identified the study of  langue solely with the former.  But can we actually purge a linguistic system of its history?  The Jakobsonian de-familiarization of poetic language would  argue against it. This process inevitably brings together past,  present, and future states of the system. Moreover, the resulting  mutations are not caused by accidents external to the system but  by its immanent need for constant rejuvenation. True, in Jakob­ son's opinion, the impulse for change is greater in poetic lan­ guage than in other functional dialects, but synchrony and di­ achrony interpenetrate in other linguistic systems as well.  Hence, a langue devoid of temporality would be a fiction. In   every synchronous linguistic system "there are styles of pronun­ ciation, grammatical variants , phrases, which are interpreted by  a collectivity of speaking subjects as belonging to and appropri­ ate to a generation of older people, and others which are consid­ ered the prerogative of youth, the latest fashion." Besides these  42. Ibid . ,  p .  30. 2 I 8   </page> <page sequence="82"> A Synecdoche  time-marked variants, Jakobson argues, diachrony mingles with  synchrony because of the functional heterogeneity of the lin­ guistic system. "The most characteristic form of the projection  of diachrony into synchrony is the attribution of a different  function to the two terms of a change ; thus, two phonological  stages are judged as attributes of two functional dialects , two  'styles. '  The characteristic form of the projection of synchrony  into diachrony, on the other hand , is the generalization of a  style ; two styles become two [developmental] stages."43  The difference between Saussure's and Jakobson's notions of  the linguistic system might be represented as shown in the  diagram.  Saussure Jakobson  c  '-.,-.'  D d  Saussure's diagram contains the following coordinates : "( 1 )  the  axis of simultaneity (AB) ,  which stands for the relations of coexist­ ing things , from which the intervention of time is excluded, and  (2 )  the axis of succession (CD) , on which only one thing can be  considered at a time but upon which are located all the things on  43.

"44 The system of lan­ guage, then, is the geometric point at which the two axes inter­ sect.  For Jakobson, as my diagram suggests, the axis of simultaneity  (ab) is impregnated with history, for in language at every mo­ ment a number of time-marked variants (archaisms, modern­ isms) always co-occur. By the same token, the axis of succession  (cd) contains more than one element at a time. Language con­ sists of several systems of functional dialects each involving a  number of subsystems linked both synchronically and diachron­ ically. Thus, rather than a hie et nunc point, the Jakobsonian  linguistic system is a field comprising homogeneous and hetero­ geneous elements .  What my diagram omits , however, is the profoundly dialectic  nature of Jakobson's linguistics, which makes any separation of  the system from its history impossible a priori . According to this  view, language is not a harmonious, symmetrical whole but an  ongoing struggle between revolutionary tendencies aiming to  alter the status quo and their conservative counterparts set on  preserving it. At any moment the system is both balanced and  imbalanced ;  it is simultaneously a state and a mutation. The  ruptures in previous equilibriums coexist with the equilibriums  that mended these ruptures, and all of them point to subsequent  changes that will redress this situation in the future. This dialec­ tic conception of language also contradicts Saussure's claim that  the causes of linguistic change are necessarily extrasystemic and  hence accidental. For Jakobson, linguistic development is trig­ gered by internal contradictions within language, and as such is  subject to the rules of the system. External factors, therefore, are  neither accidental nor destructive to langue. They are able to  penetrate and affect it only if they satisfy some of its internal  demands,  that is, only if they correspond to the developmental  tendencies of the system itself.  To return to verbal art, de-familiarization there according to  44. Course in General Linguistics, p. 80. 2 2 0  </page> <page sequence="84"> A Synecdoche  Jakobson operates on three planes . "We perceive every fact of  contemporary poetic language in necessary relation to three fac­ . tors : the current poetic tradition,  contemporary practical lan- guage, and the prior poetic tendency."45 In the case of Chleb­ nikov-the poet with whomjakobson's booklet was concerned­ the poetic tendency of the immediate past was Russian Sym­ bolism. Whereas Symbolist poetry strove to emulate music,  Chlebnikov considered the word the only proper material of  verbal art. His zaum' -speech transcending the utilitarian ra­ tionality of practical language-had no counterpart in Symbolist  poetry. Equally new was his penchant for what the Formalists  termed the "laying bare of devices,"  that is, the pure unfolding  of verbal material in poetic constructions lacking any psychologi­ cal , natural, or metaphysical motivation.46 And in contrast to the  predominantly lyrical mode of Symbolist poetry, Chlebnikov re­ turned to the epic genre. In jakobson's assessment, "Chlebnikov  gave us a new epos, the first genuinely epic creations after many  decades of drought."47  Central to Chlebnikov's rebellion against the Symbolists was  his use of the Russian vernacular. "Most of Chlebnikov's work,"  Jakobson observed , "is written in language derived from collo­ quial speech. "48 This introduction of colloquialisms into poetry  was a deliberate challenge to the Symbolist dogma that the pro­ fane language of the mob is incompatible with the sacred lan­ guage of poets . According to Vjaeeslav Ivanov, an outstanding  poet-theoretician of this movement, "in all ages in which poetry  has flourished as an art, poetic language has been contrasted to  the colloquial, common language. Both singers and the people  loved its differences and peculiarities-singers, as their pre­ rogative, a liturgical or imperial robe ; the crowd, as a national  treasure and cult. "49  45.

There were at least two antipodal tendencies within Russian  post-Symbolist poetry : the archaizing of Akmeists such as N. S .   Gumilev and 0. E .  Mandel 'stam, who sought inspiration in the  poetic tradition of past ages, and the iconoclasm of Futurists  such as Chlebnikov, who claimed that they were inventing the  art of an epoch yet to come. And even within Futurism there was  a distinct struggle between the old and the new, as manifested in  the writings of its three leading figures, Majakovskij ,  Pasternak,  and Chlebnikov. Jakobson described this conflict as follows : "In  the evolution of Russian post-Symbolist poetry Majakovskij per­ sonifies the Sturm und Drang, Chlebnikov the most clear-cut,  characteristic conquests , and Pasternak the link of this new art  with Symbolism. "50  This sketch of the Futurist movement is a good illustration of  Jakobson's dialectic conception of the linguistic (poetic) system  as a synchronous state containing conservative tendencies point­ ing toward the past and revolutionary tendencies pointing to the  future. The de-familiarization of language in verbal art is not a  simple unilateral progression in which every new work leaves all  previous ones automatized . The interaction of old and new is  instead an oscillation, a seesaw movement, as the contemporary  literary reception of the three Russian Futurists verifies . "De­ spite the fact that Chlebnikov's poetic personality crystallized  prior to Majakovskij 's and, in turn, Majakovskij's before Paster­ nak's . . . t he reader brought up on Symbolism was willing to  accept Pasternak first, then he stumbled over Majakovskij ,  and  only after conquering him was he ready to begin the strenuous  siege of Chlebnikov's fortress . "5 1   Chlebnikov's belated critical recognition, eloquently described  by Jakobson, is a function of what might be called the dialogic  nature of the literary process : the spatiotemporal gap between  50.

Here we reach a crucial contradiction,  for to conceive of the poetic utterance as dialogic is utterly in­ consistent with Husserl's or Saussure's semiotic concept underly­ ing the expressionist model .  Husserl's contempt for the dialogic form of language was ab­ solute. Once the word is addressed to someone and leaves the  safe haven of a single consciousness ,  its identity is totally com­ promised, for "all expressions in communicative speech func­ tion as indications ."52 Saussurean linguistics is equally mono­ logical. It  relegates any actual verbal intercourse to the sphere of  parole and focuses solely on langue-the set of all linguistic ele­ ments at a given moment which are uniformly internalized by  the speech community.  And because Saussure deemed language  prior to thought, the linguistic system is not merely a seamless  semiotic web connecting all individual minds but their identical  content as well. Thus, even though his Course begins with a dis­ cussion of the speech-circuit through a schematized dialogue  between Mr. A. and Mr. B, ultimately these gentlemen are noth­ ing but two identical instances of a hypostasized social con­ sciousness, two interchangeable voices in a single monologue,  two terminals whose semiotic input and output are one.  Saussure's postulate that the linguistics of langue is possible  only if the distance between the interlocutors is obliterated had  repercussions among the Russian Formalists . Those who paid  attention to the dialogic form of language turned against the  notion of system, whereas those concerned with system ignored  the dialogic. Jakubinskij and Tynjanov are the two most obvious  representatives of these opposite tendencies. In his 1 923  essay  "On Dialogic Speech," Jakubinskij rejected the teleological view  that divided language into functional dialects according to their  respective goals (though he himself had earlier propounded one  variant of this view) because he considered it too abstract for the  classification of concrete utterances . This classification, Jak­ ubinskij insisted, must proceed from the linguistics of parole,  52 .  Logical Investigations, vol. 1, p. 277 .   2 23  </page> <page sequence="87"> Russian Formalism  actual discourse . Accordingly, he drew the criteria for his classi­ fication from the two characteristics of every human interaction :  the type of contact between the subjects (immediate/mediated)  and the directionality of the information flow (alternating/  continuous) .  To the immediate (face-to-face) form of human interaction correspond  immediate farms of verbal interaction. These are characterized by the  immediate visual and aural perception of the speaker. To medi­ ated interaction corresponds ,  for example , the written form of an  utterance. Correlated with the alternating forms of interactions  involving a relatively quick exchange of actions and reactions  between interacting individuals is the dialogic form of linguistic  intercourse . And for the continuous form we have the monologic  form of utterance.53  J akubinskij believed that m contrast to the "artificial" mono­ logue, dialogue is the "natural" form of language and that the  "dialogic form is, in fact, almost always linked to the immediate  form of interaction. "54 As a result he concentrated on the oral  dialogue and described various linguistic , paralinguistic, and so­ cial features of such exchanges.  Fruitful as it might be for the study of dialogue in general,  Jakubinskij's approach was incapable of dealing with what I have  termed the dialogic quality of the literary process .  From a purely  formal standpoint, the literary work is nothing but a mediated  continuous communication, the monologue of an absent author  read by a passive audience. The curious delayed reaction to  Chlebnikov's work (as described by Jakobson) suggests that the  relationship between the author and reader is much more com- 53.

The concept of dialogue gained a rather prominent status in  the subsequent development of Russian intellectual life as a rallying point for the  scholars connected with Michail Bachtin. But with their negative attitude toward  Formalism,  the Bachtinians approached dialogue from a different perspective .  They saw it primarily as a metalinguistic phenomenon-a chain of utterances  commenting upon each other from different points of view. Thus, for the Bach­ tinians, dialogue was a predominantly ideological phenomenon.  2 24  </page> <page sequence="88"> A Synecdoche  plex. The literary audience is not merely a sounding board for  the poet's words : its choice of reading matter, the timing of its  choice, and so forth are, in fact, the audience's replies to the  author's poetic message. Clearly, such replies are a function not  only of the actual literary discourse but of the socially shared  literary system as well, the poetic tradition that conditions the  reader's interaction with the text.  Tynjanov opposed Jakubinskij in that he built his model spe­ cifically on the notion of the system. In doing so, he, like Saus­ sure, collapsed the space between author and reader. Because  he believed that a work's identity is determined by its evolution­ ary position within a literary system, this gap is irrelevant to its  identity and is simply another name for the work's alienation, its  inauthenticity . Paying attention to it merely subverts the sys­ temic metaphor and leads to subjectivism and psychologism, to a  "naive evaluation," which instead of viewing the " 'value' of a  given literary phenomenon . . . i n its 'developmental signifi­ cance and character, ' " arbitrarily "transfers the value from one  era-system to another. "55  Despite the fact that Tynjanov conceives of the era-system as a  diachronic lamination of several contrastive principles of con­ struction, there seems to be no gap between the author and the  reader within it. A "literary fact" is identical for everybody.  "Whereas a hard definition of literature is more and more difficult  to make,' '  Tynjanov claimed, "every contemporary can point his  finger at what is a literary fact. "56 But once again, the reaction of  the Russian reading public to Chlebnikov's experiments contra­ dicts this assertion.  By refusing to read them, the majority of  Chlebnikov's contemporaries indicated that for them his works  belonged among the facts of byt, somewhere between infantile  babble and the ravings of a madman; only a miniscule minority  considered them literary works. Thus , even within a single era­ system, one person's literary fact is not necessarily another's .  55. "O literaturnoj evoljucii," Archaisty i novatory, pp. 3 1 -32 .   56 .

Jakobson's expressionist model stands between Jakubinskij 's  and Tynjanov's.  It  acknowledges the dialogic relationship be­ tween the artist and audience but accommodates it within a  shared system of artistic conventions. Jakobson explored the  difference between the subjects involved in the artistic process in  his essay "On Realism in Art," published the same year as his  Chlebnikov pamphlet. The notion of realism, because of its ap­ parent simplicity, offered especially fertile ground for debunk­ ing the monologic view of art. According to the simplest defini­ tion, realism is an "artistic movement that strives for the closest  possible representation of reality, for maximal probability . "  But  within a dialogic context, "representation" and "probability" ac­ quire a curious duality : "On the one hand we deal with an inten­ tion, a goal ; that is, a work is realistic if the author conceived of  it as probable (meaning A) ; on the other hand, a work is real­ istic if I, the judging subject, perceive it as probable (meaning  B) . "57  The difference between the author and the perceiver de­ scribed by Jakobson need not, however, lead to the subjectivism  that Tynjanov feared. The degree of realistic probability is not  totally idiosyncratic ; it is measured against the background of a  given artistic tradition,  the socially valid norms for representa­ tion in art. Thus, authorial realism can be subdivided into "A 1 =  the tendency to deform a given artistic canon, interpreted as an  approximation to reality" and "A2 = the conservative tendency  within the bounds of a given artistic tradition, interpreted as  faithfulness to reality ."  The same holds for the perceiver. In the  "meaning B I  [he] is a revolutionary vis-a-vis the given artistic  conventions, who comprehends their deformation as an approx­ imation of reality . "  In "meaning B2 [he] is a conservative who  sees the deformation of the artistic conventions as a shortchang­ ing of reality. "58  57 .  "O realismu v umeni," Cerven 4 ( 1 92 1 ) , 3o i .   58 .  Ibid . ,  302 .  2 2 6   </page> <page sequence="90"> A Synecdoche  Jakobson succeeded in accommodating the spatiotemporal  gap between the participants in the artistic process within the  concept of system because of his dialectic outlook. As I argued  earlier, he conceived of the system not as a homogeneous langue  but as an ongoing struggle among antithetical tendencies and  heterogeneous elements . Moreover, the system was not inter­ nalized uniformly and totally by every subject. Rather, each indi­ vidual appropriated only a particular segment of it. From this  perspective, the author is neither identical to nor absolutely dis­ tinct from the reader. Despite the fact that the two are separate,  insofar as they share a similar attitude to past artistic canons they  are closer to each other than two contemporaneous authors who  represent opposing artistic tendencies. At the same time, conser­ vatives and revolutionaries are not unrelated either, although  their connection is a negative one. They embody the thesis and  antithesis of a single artistic state and as such they are insepara­ bly bound to each other within the given system.  One important problem arises with this argument. The in­ terplay of sameness and difference occurs within the limits of a  system. But what are the limits of the system, or in other words,  how far apart can an author and reader be before they cease to  share anything (whether positive or negative) ?  This problem is  aggravated by the particular modality of literary discourse-its  written form. Once a work is fixed in a permanent substance, it  can transcend the moment of its origin and become available to a  distant reader, projected against a poetic system that is radically  different from the one that generated it. When Jakobson and  another Moscow Circle exile in Prague, Petr Bogatyrev, com­ pared high literature and folk poetry, they discovered that the  primary difference between the two is their respective utilization  of permanent and transient linguistic substances-writing and  speech.  Their findings, published in "Folklore as a Special Form of  Creativity,"  can be summarized as follows . A literary work is  usually written,  so its existence does not coincide with its accept­ ance by the reading public . It can be ignored by the author's  contemporaries and become popular decades or even centuries  </page> <page sequence="91"> Russian Formalism  later. This fact explains the considerable freedom of the writer  in respect to the poetic canon of his or her time. The writer may  not only emulate or reject it, but ignore it totally. "In the domain  of political economy,"  Bogatyrev and Jakobson wrote, "so-called  production for the market provides a close parallel to the rela­ tionship of literature to the consumer. "  In folklore, on the other  hand, this relationship "is closer to 'production on demand. '  "59  A folkloric work, framed in the transient oral medium, comes  into existence only when accepted by the community. In fact, it  is nothing but a potential set of norms, a living artistic tradition,  which persists in the collective memory of a given group to be  actualized in every individual performance. Any innovations in­ troduced by these performances can survive only if they corre­ spond to the immanent developmental tendencies of the nor­ mative structure, and fulfill a collective demand. Asocial aberra­ tions are rejected and, unrecorded, they vanish without a trace.  The performer's attitude toward his or her creation reflects this  state of affairs . The performer exercises a "preventive cen­ sorship" and voluntarily conforms to the collective tradition.   Projected into Saussurean terminology , the difference be­ tween oral and written poetic works thus corresponds to the  opposition of langue and parole. Bogatyrev and Jakobson wrote :  The role of the performer of folkloric works may not be identi­ fied with that of either the reader, the reciter, or the author of  literary works. From the folklore performer's standpoint, the  work is a fact of langue, i .e . ,  an extrapersonal, given fact inde­ pendent of the performer, even if the fact allows for deformation  and the introduction of new poetic and quotidian material. To  the author of a work of literature, the work appears as a fact of  parole. It is not given a priori , but is subject to an individual  realization .  There is simply a set of artworks effective at a given  moment. The new work of art is to be created and perceived  against the background of their formal requisites (in that the new  work of art appropriates some forms, transforms others , and  rejects still others) .60  59.

Ibid . ,  p. 905 .  2 2 8   </page> <page sequence="92"> A Synecdoche  This is a radical statement; indeed, it is seemingly at odds with  Jakobson's notion of verbal art as a social institution. "As a fact  of parole, " the poetic work is above all a unique and individual  product definitionally exceeding the linguistic system of a given  collectivity. One could argue that I am reading too much into  Bogatyrev and Jakobson's essay. As its title suggests, it does not  pretend to deal with the entire literary process but only with its  production.  Such a reduction is possible because the principal  topic of the piece is folklore, in which creation and reception  coincide. Had the two authors dealt with literary reception, the  issue of poetic langue would have inevitably emerged.  This objection does not invalidate the point I made earlier,  however. If, as Bogatyrev and Jakobson argue, high literature is  unlike folklore in the separation of its production and reception,   then written literary texts must eventually outlive the system that  spawned them, only to be "misread" by later audiences sub­ scribing to totally different poetic canons . And considering the  actual conditions of the literary process, one might wonder how  things could be otherwise. This was, of course, in part the point  Sklovskij made in his article on Puskin, discussed in the preced­ ing chapter. Jakobson, like most of the other Formalists , rejected  the radical relativism of Sklovskij's Rezepzionsiisthetik. In his book­ let on Chlebnikov, he assailed the aesthetic egocentrism of old­ fashioned critics who "usually impose upon the past current  modes of poetic production" for negating the social nature of  verbal art. 6 1   To check the relativism creeping into his expressionist model,  Jakobson had to deal with two problems : the need to bridge the  gap between author and reader, that is, to find a system obliga­ tory for the two parties ; and the need to neutralize the written  substance of literature, whose permanence opens the identity of  the literary work to the vicissitudes of history. These problems  turned out to be two sides of the same coin, and a single solution  proposed by Jakobson took care of both of them.  6 i .  Novejsaja russkaja poezija, p. 5.  </page> <page sequence="93"> Russian Formalism  The path that led Jakobson into this difficulty is worth consid­ ering. The starting point of his poetics, we recall , was the con­ cept of the expression-a sign whose self-sameness was absolute.  Jakobson departed from Husserl, however, in conceiving of this  semiotic identity in terms of a Saussurean "social consciousness" ;   he then further relativized it by breaking up langue into histor­ ically changing functional dialects . Among these, poetic lan­ guage, propelled by its need for incessant de-familiarization,  exhibited the highest degree of change and thus, ironically, was  the least reliable guarantor of long-term semiotic identity .  To mitigate the tension between phenomenological stability  and Futurist instability in the aesthetic sign Jakobson's strategy  was to turn to language itself, a move I call the "linguistic princi­ ple" of his poetics. For him, the literary work is always perceived  against the background of contemporary practical language. Po­ etic language, to appropriate Vinokur's "Marxist" lingo, is a  mere superstructure built upon this normative basis ; the aes­ thetic efficacy of a literary work is founded upon it. Once the  author and audience cease to share the system of practical lan­ guage, the text can no longer function poetically. Jakobson  made this point clear in the introduction to his edition of two  Czech poetic compositions of the early fourteenth century : "Lit­ erary works are so connected with language, they are linguistic  facts to such a degree that the distance between the linguistic  structure giving rise to the medieval poem and modern lin­ guistic usage is a serious hindrance to its living perception .  It is  easier to perceive the aesthetic value of an ancient painting or  building than to live out the linguistic consciousness of a writer  or a reader from that period . This explains why the resurrection  of the medieval poetic work as an aesthetically experienced fact  lags behind our surmounting of the merely archaeological ap­ proach to the medieval visual arts . "62  This argument, of course, has its roots in Jakobson's "logo- 62. "Dve staroceske skladby o smrti ," Spor d'USe s telem. 0 nebezpeenem casu smrti  (Prague, i 927 ) ,  p. g.  23 0  </page> <page sequence="94"> A Synecdoche  centric" notion of language, according to which every linguistic  fact is a vehicle for intersubjective, cognitive meanings. A poetic  utterance, as an expression, is a prime example of such a sign.  The same holds for communicative utterances. They differ  from expressions not in being without such meanings, but in  subordinating them to the referential functions they carry out.  This intrinsic bond between the two functional dialects limits the  possible spatiotemporal displacement of the literary work that  threatened its identity. Therefore, the writer and the reader  cannot be totally isolated from each other as long as they share a  language. They might subscribe to different literary canons, but  the more conservative system of practical language is still com­ mon to them. Thus, the "misreading" of a work, its projection  against. a set of poetic norms totally alien to it, still implies that  the work makes sense as an utterance. Such a misreading is  qualitatively different from the simple incomprehension that  occurs when a work is produced in a language unknown to the  reader.  At this point, however, it might appear that Jakobson would  like to have it both ways. He claims that "every word of poetic  language is in essence phonically and semantically deformed vis­ a-vis practical language" and thus he can speak of "language in  its aesthetic function" as a specific dialect "governed by its own  immanent laws. "63 Yet at the same time he maintains that in  some respects poetic utterances are not totally unlike those ful­ filling a communicative function.  Ultimately though, Jakobson comes down on the side of non­ uniqueness. If verbal art is the "organized violence of poetic  form upon language,"  such violence is necessarily circumscribed  by certain limits, and these are the limits of language itself. 64 A  poetic form cannot distort its material to such a degree that it  loses its linguistic nature. There is a sacrosanct structure under­ lying all functional dialects and rendering articulated sounds  63. Novejfaja russkaja poezija, p. 47.  64. 0 cesskom stiche, p.  1 6.  23 1  </page> <page sequence="95"> Russian Formalism  (even the Futurist zaum' )  linguistic facts . This structure is the  phonological system of a given national language. It was thus  phonology that Jakobson chose as the key to the self-sameness of  the literary sign.  For Saussure, the study of phonology outlined in his Course  was an important aspect of linguistic science. This discipline was  charged with the task of examining the verbal signifier outside  its historical development. It proceeded from the premise  Jacques Derrida has termed "phonocentrism," namely, the view  that the spoken word is the original , authentic form of lan­ guage. 65 Phonocentrism counters the infinite spatiotemporal  dislocation of the sign that relativizes its identity by eliminating  the cause of this slippage-written language. In Saussurean lin­ guistics, the absolute self-sameness of the verbal sign is guaran­ teed by its participation in the synchronic system of langue inter­ nalized uniformly by every member of the speech community.  Because of its transience, intangibility, and absolute proximity to  the speaking subject, voice is much better suited to embodying  the signifier than writing is . Fixed in permanent and tangible  matter, the inscription falls outside the purely mental langue,  and hence is subject to the vagaries of external forces . The nu­ merous discrepancies between pronunciation and spelling, in  Saussure's opinion, reveal the inability of the graphic substance  to represent faithfully the internal system of language. Whether  flukes of history, geography, or false etymology, they lead to a  single conclusion: "writing obscures language; it is not a guise  for language but a disguise ."66  It  is, however, obvious that in its raw physical heterogeneity  the phone cannot participate in the system of language as Saus­ sure conceives of it. Its amorphous multiplicity must be reduced  to a limited inventory of elements which can be incorporated  into the relational grid of langue. Here Saussure's phonocen­ trism merges with his logocentric view, according to which voice  65. See, for example, Of Grammatology, pp. 27-44 .  66. Course in General Linguistics, p. 30.  23 2  </page> <page sequence="96"> A Synecdoche  is solely the vehicle of reason and has no value outside this  relationship. "Sound," as he sees it, "is only the instrument of  thought; by itself it has no existence."67 The phoneme-the  minimal unit of the signifier-is, therefore, defined through its  relation to the signified-the rational meaning it expresses.  "The important thing in the word is not sound alone but the  phonic differences that make it possible to distinguish this word  from all others, for differences carry signification."68 Thus, the  phoneme is nothing but a speech sound that is capable of differ­ entiating morphemes. Saussure illustrates this point with the  Russian speech sound t. It can be pronounced in a number of  ways : aspirated, palatalized, and so forth. The aspirated variant,  though acoustically quite distinct, does not differentiate mean­ ing in Russian and, hence, is not an element of its phonological  system. The palatalized t, on the other hand, as a verbal desi­ nence, signals an infinitive form of the Russian verb, in contrast  to the nonpalatalized t which in the same position indicates the  third person singular form, and therefore is a phoneme.  This approach to phonology provided Jakobson with a solu­ tion to the two possible sources of relativism within his ex­ pressionist model. By proclaiming the voice to be the original  substance of language, phonology eliminated one cause of the  spatiotemporal dislocation of the literary work : its written form.  As a mere secondary representation of sound, the written text  must always relate to the primary substance-voice-whose basic  structure is provided by the phonological system of a given  language.  Phonology also takes care of the second cause of semiotic slip­ page-the distance between the participants in the literary pro­ cess. Of the multitude of norms making up language, the pho­ nological system is the most obligatory, the one the interlocutors  must share if any intercourse at all is to take place. This postulate  stems from the Saussurean conception of language as a semiotic  67. Ibid . ,  p. 8.  68. Ibid . ,  p. 1 1 8 .   233  </page> <page sequence="97"> Russian Formalism  system whose significatory mechanism is by definition double­ tiered. Full-fledged signs or signifiers that carry meaning re­ quire the existence of smaller sound elements which do not sig­ nify in themselves but serve to differentiate the signifiers of  unlike meanings. These meaning-differentiating elements , or  phonemes, thus constitute the most elementary linguistic sys­ tem, which is indispensable to the semiotic functioning of lan­ guage. In other words, according to this view there can be no  language without a phonemic system. Therefore, poetic violence  cannot deform this system in any significant way, or verbal art  would lose its linguistic nature and become a "variety of less than  perfect vocal music ."69  The. phonological conception of the linguistic signifier en­ abled Jakobson to treat poetic sound in a way radically different  from the transrational model of OPOJAZ. Even if the phonic  stratum of poetic language is deformed on purpose , its relation  to cognitive meaning is not eliminated, for verbal art "operates  not with sounds but with phonemes, i .e . ,  acoustic representa­ tions capable of being associated with semantic representa­ tions. "70 Even utterances that "deliberately strive to avoid any  relationship with a given practical language" (such as the zaum'  of the Russian Futurists) cannot escape the constraints of pho­ nology, "for insofar as [a given practical language] exists and a  phonetic tradition is present, transrational language is as distinct  from prelingual onomatopoeias as a nude contemporary Euro­ pean is from a naked troglodyte."7 1  Jakobson's claim extended not only to poetic production but  to reception as well. Once a subject internalizes the phonological  69. Novejfaja russkaja poezija, p. 48. A special problem that deserves more  attention than I can devote to it here is the historical changeability of phonemic  systems. In contrast to Saussure, Jakobson maintained that these systems evolve.  At the same time, he regarded this change as purely phenomenal, not affecting  their "deep structures"-the universal and absolute inventory of hierarchically  correlated distinctive features that in one way or another is implemented in  every actual phonological system.  70. Novejfaja russkaja poezija, p. 48.  7 1 .  Ibid . ,  p. 67 .  234  </page> <page sequence="98"> A Synecdoche  system, he or she perceives every linguistic sound in terms of it.  Here the expressionist model diverges from the purely acoustic  approach to poetry characteristic of Ohrenphilologi,e and its For­ malist followers . Arguing against one of its basic postulates pro­ pounded by Saran-that the "theoretician of verse . . . o ught to  adopt toward verse the attitude of a foreigner who listens to it  without knowing the language"-Jakobson wrote : "Not a single  person perceives the sound form of poetry in his native tongue,  its rhythm in particular, as Saran's foreigner does . Indeed, even  this foreigner is fictitious ; even his perception would not be  purely acoustic. He would merely approach the foreign utter­ ance from the standpoint of his own phonological system, with  his own phonological habits . He would, so to speak, trans­ phonologize this utterance. "72  Jakobson did not stop at criticizing older conceptions of poetic  sound ; he advanced his own theories about the phonic organiza­ tion of poetry. The most ambitious was the project of a "pho­ nological prosody" launched in a comparative study of Czech  and Russian verse in 1 923 .  Earlier we encountered the polariza­ tion of the OPOJAZ membership on the issue of poetic language  as opposed to verse language. Those on the side of poetic lan­ guage considered rhythm just one among many devices charac­ terizing poetic language, and hence largely ignored it, whereas  the others rejected the notion of poetic language as too vague,  and focused on the specific problems of verse rhythm. The ex­ pressionist model, however, managed to bring these two per­ spectives together by integrating versification into the overall  study of poetic language .  Jakobson's discussion of verse was indirectly a polemic against  Brik's identification of verse with the single device of rhythm.  According to Jakobson, the mere presence of rhythm in an ut­ terance does not render it poetic , for rhythm may equally occur  in practical language. It  is the role rhythm performs in these  functional dialects that differs. "The dynamic rhythm of prac- 72. 0 cesskom stiche, p. 2 1 .   235  </page> <page sequence="99"> Russian Formalism  tical language is a process that automatizes exhalation during an  utterance. In contrast, poetic rhythm is one of the ways to de­ automatize the utterance . It is the prerequisite of the [mental]  set toward the time of the utterance, what the German psychol­ ogists call the experiencing of time (Zeiterlebnis) .  The division of  an utterance into subjectively equal segments, the rhythmical  inertia that makes us expect the repetition of a specific signal at a  specific moment, the repetition of this signal that foregrounds  that signalized sound vis-a-vis its neighbors , all of this is missing  in practical language, where time is not experienced."73  This delimitation of practical and poetic rhythm proceeds  from the same principles that Jakobson employed to distinguish  poetic language from the other functional dialects . What is in­ volved, first of all, is the phenomenological principle : verse trig­ gers a particular set toward the utterance in the perceiving sub­ ject. Its temporal dimension, which in communicative discourse  is irrelevant, becomes the center of attention in verse language .  According to Jakobson, "poetic time is a typical Erwartungszeit;  after a particular period expires we expect a particular signal .  This time superimposed upon the utterance subjectively trans­ forms it. "74 What is in question here is another manifestation of  the Futurist principle . By foregrounding a feature which in  practical language is merely a means toward a communicative  end, verse de-familiarizes the verbal medium and renders prom­ inent the internal structure of the verbal sign . Moreover, this  transformation employs a particular variant of the two basic  devices operating in every poetic utterance. The speech chain is  dissolved into rhythm-creating elements only to be reassembled  on the basis of their regular repetition.   At this point, i t  might appear that Jakobson's phonological  prosody does not differ significantly from the other Formalists'  positions on verse. Viktor Sklovskij , for example, arguing  against Spencer's conception of rhythm as an energy-saving  mechanism, had already pointed out the difference between  73. Ibid . ,  pp. 1 7- 1 8 .  74. Ibid . ,  p. 1 9 .   </page> <page sequence="100"> A Synecdoche  prosaic and poetic rhythm-between the regular rhythm of a  work song, which by automatizing movements tends to save la­ bor, and the violation of this rhythm in art for the sake of de­ familiarized, difficult perception. 75 One could also draw a paral­ lel between Tynjanov's and Jakobson's discussions of the tern- .  porality of verse language . Tomasevskij's redefinition of the  "rhythmical impulse" is also quite close to Jakobson's under­ standing of verse perception as the pendulum-like process of  expectations and fulfillments aroused in a perceiver's con­ sciousness by the regular recurrence of rhythm-creating ele­ ments.  As I observed earlier, the Formalists never reached an agree­ ment as to what those rhythm-creating elements were. Tyn­ janov's graphic approach, according to which the ultimate  source of poetic rhythm is the visual property of the verse line,  was rejected by other Formalists as too simplistic to have any  explanatory value. Tomasevskij wrote that in verse, "graphics is  merely a sign, not unlike punctuation, that expresses other lin­ guistic correlations but only sometimes is the sole objective evi­ dence of these correlations (as when it happens that only punc­ tuation makes a sentence understandable) .  For often the other  factors are so powerful that graphics becomes redundant and  merely accompanies an utterance that is understandable without  it. Thus, Puskin's classic verses will remain such even if printed  as prose."76 It is the various prosodic features existing in lan­ guage, Tomasevskij asserted, whose regular alternations create  the rhythmical impulse. But even though he seemed intuitively  aware of what these features were, he failed to specify them, and  went on to embrace Jakobson's phonological prosody, which  provided a coherent and simple hypothesis about the nature of  the rhythm-creating elements in verse. 77  75.

This organization, moreover, must be rooted in the phonologi­ cal system of a particular language. Given the resistance of this  system to poetic violation, the linguistic principle leads to two  conclusions : first, verse deforms above all the extraphonemic  elements of language, and second, it is the inviolable pho­ nological elements that provide the organizational base for this  violence. That is, phonological features are those hitherto elu­ sive rhythm-creating elements .  Earlier I tried to show how the differences among the various  Formalist theories of verse were conditioned by their points of  departure. The same applies to Jakobson.  The other members  of the movement dealt primarily with Russian verse : Jakobson's  orientation was comparative. As an exile in Prague, he was in  fact Saran's foreigner forced to experience poetry in an alien  language . Indeed, it was this experience that convinced him of  the intimate link between verse and language. While the other  Formalists considered prosodic features such as stress non­ problematic , Jakobson, transplanted into a foreign linguistic  milieu, directly witnessed their relativity . This relativity was es­ pecially evident because Czech and Russian are so similar. At  first glance Puskin's line appears almost identical to its Czech  translation :   Russian : Burja mgloju nebo kroet  Czech : Boute mlhou nebe kryje78  And yet an actual reading reveals a tremendous prosodic dif­ ference between them. This difference, Jakobson argues , results  from the dissimilarity of the Czech and Russian phonological  systems. While both languages contain dynamic stress, only in  Russian is it a phonological element; for example, muka (tor- 78. 0 lefskom stiche, pp. 46-47.

Czech stress, on the other hand, always falls on the initial syllable  of the word and, therefore, is nonphonemic. But vocalic length  differentiates words in Czech, for example, byt (apartment) and  by:t (to be) , something it cannot do in Russian, where vocalic  length is obligatorily bound to stress.  Given Jakobson's premise that the rhythm-creating elements  must be phonologically based, it might appear that the dif­ ference between Czech and Russian prosody lies in the fact that  the former is quantitative (tied to vocalic length) ,  whereas the  latter is accentual (tied to word stress) , but, with the exception of  the early nineteenth century when a few attempts at quantitative  metrics appeared, modern Czech verse, like Russian verse, has  been based on the regular alternation of stressed and unstressed  syllables .  Accordingly, Jakobson introduced another phonologi­ cal element into his theory-word boundary. Just as Russian  quantity always coincides with stress, Czech stress (fixed on the  initial syllable of the word) always coincides with word bound­ ary. Therefore, Jakobson concluded, not stress but word bound­ ary is the rhythm-creating element in Czech verse.79  The foregoing discussion yields the following typology of  phonic phenomena that play a role in the constitution of verse:   "( 1 ) the phonological basis of rhythm, (2 )  concomitant extra­ phonemic elements, and (3) autonomous phonological elements ,  or more precisely,  phonological elements that in a given poetic  language are not a factor in the rhythmical inertia. "80 The pro­ found difference between the Czech and Russian systems of  versification becomes obvious if we superimpose this grid upon  the prosodic features with which they operate : stress, quantity,  and word boundary.  79. This is the most controversial point in Jakobson's theory. For the oppos­ ing view, which maintains that stress rather than word boundary constitutes the  prosodic basis of Czech verse, see, for example, J. Mukatovsky, "Roman Jakob­ son : Zaklady leskeho verse, " Na5e fel lo ( 1 926) ,  2 1 7-20; or M.

First of all, Jakobson argues,  they differ in their dis­ tribution of quantity . In the Russian original, following the reg­ ular trochaic alternation of stresses, every odd syllable is long,  whereas in the Czech version only the first and fourth syllables  with the diphthong ou are quantitatively different from the rest.  Second, because Russian stress is free, the fact that every word in  Puskin's line is disyllabic is "perceived as an episodic coincidence  of the normally autonomous word boundary with the rhyth­ mical inertia. "  In Czech, on the other hand, with its fixed stress  and with "word boundary the basic rhythm-creating factor . . .  the quoted line in respect to its word boundaries is canonical. "82  This example illustrates the plausibility of Jakobson's hypoth­ esis about the close link between the prosodic and phonological  systems. It would be wrong to interpret this link in a totally  deterministic fashion, to say that one particular phonological  system inevitably gives rise to one particular system of versifica­ tion. On the contrary, as the history of Czech verse has shown,  the early nineteenth century witnessed a struggle between quan­ titative and accentual (or, more precisely, accentual-syllabic)  prosodies, both based on different phonological elements coex­ isting in Czech. Thus, the actual victory of accentual-syllabic  verse cannot be explained in terms of phonology. This was the  conclusion Jakobson reached in the final paragraph of his study :   "I think that a versification system can never be totally deduced  S i .

If a versification system is the unknown  X, and what is given to us are only the prosodic elements of the  language, we can arrive merely at an indeterminate equation,  i .e . , the possibility of several values for the X. An explanation for  the historical choice of this or that solution from among the  several possible ones involves factors that are outside the pho­ netics of the given language, namely, the present poetic tradi­ tion, the relationship of the given poetic movement to this tradi­ tion, and cultural influences ."83  This conclusion was not at variance with the universalistic  thrust of the expressionist model . Despite its possible hetero­ morphism, the essence of verse is still provided by the pho­ nological system of the language underlying it, the ultimate sys­ tem connecting the participants of the literary process. But, as  Stephen Rudy has observed, Jakobson's conclusion contains the  seeds of the full subsequent development ofJ akobsonian poetics :  "It anticipates his later realization that literature is part of a  'system of systems' and its study necessitates a 'correlation be­ tween the literary series and other historical series . '  "84 The  quotation within Rudy's passage is taken from the nine-point  thesis written in i 928  by Tynjanov, the leading theoretician of the  then-defunct OPOJAZ, and Jakobson, the vice-chairman of the  newly established Prague Linguistic Circle . These theses are gen­ erally recognized as marking the end of the Formalist era and the  beginning of a new stage of literary studies that emerged in  Prague under the name of Structuralism. 85  83.
