<plain_text><page sequence="1">94 MISCELLANEA CATULLUS LXIV 287-88 285 confestim Penios adest, viridantia Tempe, Tempe, quae silvae cingunt super impendentes, t Minosim linquens doris celebranda chor?is. ???? acuos: namque ille tulit radicitus altas fagos ac recto proceras stipite laurus 290 non sine nutanti platano lentaque sorore fiammati Phaethontis et aeria cupressu. Such is W. Eisenhut's forbidding Teubner text (1983) of these two lines. If fools would still rush in, there is also his initial and even more forbidding note on them: versus multum vexati insanabiles videntur. I shall be brief). In leaving Tempe to attend Peleus' wedding, Peneus may have exposed or abandoned the place to some sort of activity which his presence there normally discouraged. For linquens, "abandoning (to)", one may compare Virg. Aen. V. 795, socios ignotae linquere terrae, X 559, alitibus linquere feris, and Sen. Med. 618, liquit indocto regimen magistro2); and for linquens ... celebranda, Kroll compared Cic. Fam. 16.12.1, et patriam ipsam vel diripien- dam vel inflammandam reliquimus3). Peneus is an aquatic deity, the god of a mighty river4), so that if any group of people could be imagined?with due poetic exaggeration?to welcome his departure and relish his absence, it would surely be the vinosi, the lovers of wine, who traditionally resent the mixing and dilution of their wine with water5). Aquam foras, vinum introl So cries Trimalchio (Petr. 52.7)6), and this is how Catullus himself denounces water in XXVII, his sole drinking song: 5 at vos quo lubet hinc abite, lymphae, vini pernicies, et ad severos migrate: hic merus est Thyonianus. There, lymphae (5) perhaps should be capitalised, as M. C. J. Putnam pro- posed: the poet addresses the Lymphae, the water-spirits, and the conceit will then be that their "departure leaves the world of straight alcohol with- out any menace?hic merus est Thyonianus1*7). By the same sort of conceit, the departure of Peneus from Tempe will have left it to the celebrations of the vinosi, for even when he is apparently quite anthropomorphic?and away from his river attending a wedding?Peneus and his waters must be considered one and the same in power and spirit; in a sense, the river itself has come to the wedding8). I would suggest, then, that in line 287 we should read vinosis for MSS minosim, along with Madvig's duris for MSS doris: vinosis linquens duris celebrandis chor?is 'leaving (Tempe) to the wine-lovers, to be thronged with their clumsy dances' For vinosus in poetry, see Plaut. Cure. 79, (Leaena) vinosissima est; Hor. Epist. I 13.14, vinosa ... Pyrria; I 19.6, vinosus Homerus; ??. Fast. Ill 765, Mnemosyne, Vol. XLII, Fase 1-2 (1989)</page><page sequence="2">MISCELLANEA 95 vinosior aetas; ??. Am. Ill 1.17, vinosa ... conviv?a; Juv. IX 113, {nec derit qui...) miseram vinosus inebriet aurem. And for the substantive use of the masculine plural, as proposed, compare Cicero's use of the similar vinolentus in Tuse. V 118, ne sobrius in violentiam vinolentorum incidat9). Cor- ruption of vinosis lin- to minosim lin- would have been encouraged by earlier references in the poem to Ariadne (60, Minois, and 247, Minoidi) and to Minos (85, Minoa) and the Minotaur (79, Minotauro). For the clumsy dances of drunken revellers {duris ... chor?is), compare Ov. Fast. Ill 537 (on the feast of Anna Perenna), et ducunt p?sito duras cratere choreas10). In the next line, the standard correction of Fs non acuos {acc- in 0) is Bergk's non vacuos ( = Baptista Guarinus' non vacuus, published in Alex. Guarinus' edition of 1521), which is supposed to mean "not empty- handed". In fact, the OLD cites this very line, so emended, for vacuus = "Bearing or conveying nothing" (s.v., 4). Yet the parallels are few and late: Stat. Silv. I 3.82, qui numquam vacui prodistis in aethera, rami; Juv. X 22, cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator; Apul. Met. VI 18, non vacua debebis per illas tenebras incedere, sed off as ... gestare11). Thus there might seem to be good grounds for Eisenhut's decision not to accept non vacuos, and for his desparing ]non acuos. But non vacuos is palaeographically very attractive, and some sort of meiotic reference to Peneus' busyness would appear to be needed before namque ille tulit.... I suggest therefore that non vacuos is right, but that vacuos means "at leisure" or "free from work" (OLD, s.v., II)12). The point then will be that, although he has left his regular duties behind in Tempe to attend the wedding13), Peneus is not "idle" or "free from work", for he has brought with him an assortment oftall trees (288-91), and has been busy placing them far and wide around the house (292-93, haec circum sedes late contexta locavitj vestibulum ut molli velatum fronde virerei).
