<plain_text><page sequence="1">Academy of Management Journal SPECIAL RESEARCH FORUM CALL FOR PAPERS BUILDING BRIDGES ACROSS LEVELS Guest Editors: Paul Beamish, Michael Hitt, Susan Jackson, and John Mathieu On the basis of a network analysis of Academy members' divisional memberships, Pearce (2003) expressed concern that the Academy is becoming a bifurcated organization, with the vast majority of members participating in either macro- or micro oriented divisions, but rarely both at the same time. This possibility could be interpreted as a cause for alarm within the Academy's scholarly community. By focusing our attention on narrow subsets of the broad fields of management and organization stud ies, we limit our ability to understand organiza tions as total systems and to conduct research to determine more viable ways of improving them. One of the most frequent recommendations for improving research in the management and organi zational sciences is to build bridges across different levels of theory and analysis so that we might better understand the holistic and interrelated nature of complex organizations: A continuing and frequently stated challenge. . .is to forge a stronger link between the macro and micro parts of the field. ... A focus on only the macro side or only the micro side of the organizational studies coin, as it were, will keep giving us an incomplete and ultimately unsatisfying picture. (Porter, 1996) Despite the historical tradition and contemporary relevance of organizational systems theory, its influ ence is merely metaphorical. The system is sliced into organization, group, and individual levels, each level the province of different disciplines, theories, and approaches. The organization may be an inte grated system, but organizational science is not. (Kozlowski &amp; Klein, 2000) As the field has grown and elaborated new perspec tives, it has continually been threatened with becoming not so much a new integrated semi discipline as a set of independent, self-congratulatory cultures of comprehension. (March, 1996) The strength and comparative advantage of organi zational behavior lies in the diversity of the para digms considered under its big tent. . .our challenge is to transform these differences into greater insight regarding the complexity of organizational behavior. (Rousseau, 2000) Many other scholars have made similar calls for research that crosses disciplinary boundaries and levels of analysis (e.g., see Rousseau, 1985; Cap pelli &amp; Sherer, 1991; Barney, 1992; Hackman, 2003). Nevertheless, empirical research that re flects these views remains scarce. A recent survey of AMJ board members suggests that many Academy members want AMJ to help create the greater insight championed by scholars such as these by encouraging a careful balance? and wherever possible, an integration?of macro and micro perspectives. Academy members look to AMJ and the other Academy journals (AMR, AME, and AMLE) for a broad view of how their own area of specialization contributes to a bigger picture of organizational phenomena. At the same time, they hope to learn how developments in other, related disciplines (e.g., psychology, sociology, economics, political science) contribute to an improved under standing of organization. This special research forum is designed to move us closer to the goal of holistic learning and insight by encouraging research that spans levels of theory and analysis (national, organization, team/unit/group and individual), bridges the subdisciplines within management, and links management research to other disciplines. Our special interest is in bridging macro (e.g., nation, organization) and micro (e.g., subsidiary, group/ team/unit, individual) areas of study. We encour age papers that extend current paradigms by in tegrating macro and micro theories across the subdisciplines of management or between man agement and other disciplines. TYPES OF RESEARCH SOUGHT We expect this special forum to be of interest to scholars from all Academy of Management divi sions. We encourage scholars from different AOM divisions and those who are working at different levels of analysis to engage in cooperative research ventures for this special research forum. We have a special interest in cooperative ventures that result in frame-breaking research. Types of studies sought include (but are not limited to) the following: Research designed to assess whether a particular phenomenon generalizes across individual, group, organizational, and/or national levels (for an example, see Staw, Sandelands &amp; Dutton, 1981), or to determine functional relationships 1183</page><page sequence="2">1184 Academy of Management Journal December among constructs in the same content domain at different levels of analysis (see Rousseau, 1985; Chan, 1998). Cross-level research in which differences in or ganization-level policies and practices are re lated to differential attitudes, behaviors, and out comes at lower levels (e.g., see Klein, 1980), or where aggregate employee attitudes are shown to relate to organizational outcomes (e.g., see Den nison, 1990). Cross-level research that examines relationships between organization-level phenomena (e.g., firm financial performance) and sublevel phe nomena (employee attitudes) over time (see, e.g., Schneider, Hanges, Smith, &amp; Salvaggio, 2002), thus illuminating causal or interactive processes. Cross-level research that examines relationships between networked organizations or alliance partners and intrafirm phenomena (e.g., Almeida &amp; Phene, 2004; Yamin &amp; Otto, 2004). Cross-level research that examines how differ ences in national cultures and institutional ar rangements influence the dynamics of interfirm (e.g., Gamble, 2003), firm-level (e.g., Hitt, Dacin, Levitas, Arregle, &amp; Borza, 2000), and subsidiary/ affiliate-level phenomena (Makino, Isobe, &amp; Chan, 2004). Case studies of momentous events that illumi nate the cross-level dynamics of organizational change or reactions to crisis (e.g., Dutton &amp; Duk erich, 1991). Innovative studies that apply micro theories to phenomena that have traditionally been exam ined through a macro lens (e.g., Carpenter &amp; Westphal, 2001), or that apply macro theories to lower-level phenomena. These innovative stud ies extend to the integration of micro and macro theories that might change our understanding of micro or macro activities or that might allow us to examine new and important research ques tions regarding behavioral or organizational phenomena. This list is merely suggestive of the range of top ics appropriate for this Special Research Forum on Building Bridges across Levels. Good discussions of cross-level theory and methods and other ideas can be found in Kozlowski and Klein (2000) and in Chen, Mathieu, and Bliese (2004).

Most theory development and articulation within management and organizational studies have proceeded through the use of verbal argumentation. Many notable excep tions nonetheless exist. Simulations have usefully identified some of the counter intuitive advantages of learning slowly (ex ploration), demonstrated that ecological competition may not remove inefficient or ganizational forms from the population, and examined why moderate levels of interde pendence between the operations of an organization may form the basis of compet itive advantage (replication without imita tion). Formal mathematical modeling has uncovered surprising implications regard ing such topics as the formation of status hierarchies and for theories such as organi zational ecology. And recent logical formal izations have identified several implicit as sumptions and new implications for both contingency theory and organizational ecol ogy Through this special topic forum we hope to encourage new theory development and the articulation of new implications of exist ing theory concerning organizational phe nomena via the use of formal methods: mathematical models, simulations, and for mal logical models. We seek papers that confront core management issues and that generate substantive new insights. Formal approaches to theory building pro vide tools for translating theoretical ideas into a formal language that requires precise definitions and statements of assumptions. This precise language allows researchers to go beyond intuition to draw on a wealth of analytical and computational tools in under standing the implications of a set of govern ing assumptions. These tools allow theorists not only to check their logic but to develop a wide range of testable implications. Speci fying assumptions and the relationships be tween them also facilitates the elaboration and extension of theories and findings. Formal modeling papers should contain novel results proved using appropriate methods with the necessary assumptions and analytical objects clearly identified. Simulations should produce new theory or elaborate new derivations from existing the ory. Because one of our objectives is to expand the audience for formal theory, prospective authors should write their papers in a fash ion that is both rigorous and accessible to the uninitiated. We will favor submissions that present their findings and supporting arguments in a manner that allows readers without specialized training in the formal method to interpret and follow. For example, in addition to the formal proofs, authors should depict their results graphically or in clude verbal versions of their propositions and the intuition behind them. In this re spect, we strongly encourage prospective authors to think creatively regarding how to open their work to a wider audience. Papers deemed inaccessible to the readership of AMR may be returned without review. Although not exhaustive, the following set of research questions includes issues that one could address through simulation or for mal modeling: Where do fads and fashions come from? How does endogenous sampling influ ence decision making? How do the population dynamics of buy ers and suppliers influence one an other? 1186</page><page sequence="5">How does group composition affect the efficiency and innovativeness of teams? What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a firm to have a compet itive advantage? How do selection processes at different levels (e.g., within and across firms) in teract? How does the optimal organization structure vary with the task environ ment? Where do interorganizational networks come from, and how do they affect firm performance? Under what conditions can incumbent organizations successfully adapt to en vironmental change?

ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT CODE OF ETHICAL CONDUCT CREDO We believe in discovering, sharing, and applying man agerial knowledge. PREAMBLE Our professional goals are to enhance the learning of students, colleagues, and others and to improve the ef fectiveness of organizations through our teaching, re search, and practice of management. We have five major responsibilities: 1. To our students?Relationships with students require respect, fairness, and caring, along with recognition of our commitment to the subject matter and to teaching excellence. 2. To managerial knowledge?Prudence in research de sign, human subject use, confidentiality, result report ing, and proper attribution of work is a necessity. 3. To the Academy of Management and the larger pro fessional environment?Support of the Academy's mission and objectives, service to the Academy and our institutions, and the recognition of the dignity and personal worth of colleagues are required. 4. To both managers and the practice of management? Exchange of ideas and information between the aca demic and organizational communities is essential. 5. To all people with whom we live and work in the world community?Sensitivity to other people, to di verse cultures, to the needs of the poor and disadvan taged, to ethical issues, and to newly emerging ethical dilemmas is required. STUDENT RELATIONSHIPS In our roles as educators, the central principles that underlie appropriate student-educator relationships are professionalism, respect, fairness, and concern. Striving for teaching excellence. It is the duty of Acad emy members who are educators to prepare themselves carefully. Maintenance of current knowledge in the field requires a broad understanding of management theories, research and practice, and use of current classroom ma terials. Educators should have or develop expertise in the areas in which they teach. Effective teaching requires sufficient time allocated to preparation, clear classroom communication, timely grading, and a willingness to pro vide an explanation of a student's grade. Educators should act as role models in their relationships. They should also sensitize students to the ethical dimensions of management. In addition, educators have an obligation to present material without conscious bias and to make their own relevant biases known to their students. Edu cators should attempt to evaluate their teaching through some appropriate outcome assessment method which goes beyond concept retention. Showing respect for students. It is the duty of Acad emy members who are educators to show appropriate respect for students' feelings, interests, needs, contribu tions, and intellectual freedom. Students' right to privacy requires maintaining the confidentiality of academic records and private communications, unless disclosure is mandated by law, institutional policy, or morally com pelling purpose. Educators must avoid manipulation, co ercion, or exploitation of students (especially acts di rected at securing monetary, ego, or sexual gratification) and should demonstrate a sensitivity to cultural and personal diversity by avoiding racial, sexual, religious, and ethnic discrimination. Maintenance of objectivity and fairness. It is the duty of Academy members who are educators to treat students equitably. Fair treatment of students requires explicitly explaining and adhering to academic requirements and standards. Any subsequent change in these requirements or standards, either of the institution or in an individual course, should appropriately recognize the impact on students. Impartiality, objectivity, and fairness are re quired in all dealings with students. Examinations should be carefully prepared and written work graded in an impartial manner. Educators should scrupulously avoid entering any overly personal relationship or ac cepting any gift or favor which might influence, or ap pear to influence, an objective evaluation of a student's work. Appropriate evaluation of student performance re quires test design, assignments, and testing conditions which minimize the possibility of academic misconduct. It is the educator's responsibility to pursue appropriate disciplinary action if necessary. Counseling of students. It is the duty of Academy members to be helpful and sensitive in counseling stu dents. When serving as academic advisors, members must be knowledgeable about academic requirements and should communicate these clearly and fully to advi sees. Educators may play critical roles in a variety of counseling situations. This requires careful analysis of the student and situation and calls for special expertise and competence. Counseling advice should be identified as an expression of the member's own opinion. Letters of recommendation require candor and fairness. Members should not make insupportable statements or fail to dis close material facts. ADVANCEMENT OF MANAGERIAL KNOWLEDGE The research of Academy members should be done honestly, have a clear purpose, show respect for the rights of all individuals and organizations, efficiently use resources, and advance knowledge in the field. 1188</page><page sequence="7">2005 Code of Ethical Conduct 1189 Conducting and reporting. It is the duty of Academy members conducting research to design, implement, an alyze, report, and present their findings rigorously. Re search rigor includes careful design, execution, analysis, interpretation of results, and retention of data. Presenta tion of research should include a treatment of the data that is honest and that reveals both strengths and weak nesses of findings. When important alternate hypotheses or explanations exist, they should be noted, and data that disconfirm hypotheses should be acknowledged. Author ship and credit should be shared in correct proportion to the various parties' contributions. Whether published or not, ideas or concepts derived from others should be acknowledged, as should advice and assistance received. Many management-related journals have policies prohib iting or restricting potential articles from being reviewed concurrently in other outlets. These policies should be closely observed or there should be explicit discussion with the relevant journal editors concerning the intended multiple submissions. More than one report of essen tially the same data and results should not be published unless the reports are explicitly directed to different au diences through different types of outlets. When several separate but related reports result from a single study, the existence of the different reports should be made known to the relevant journal editors and the reports should reference each other. Reviewer comments should be con sidered thoughtfully before a manuscript is submitted to a different journal. Participants. It is the duty of Academy members to preserve and protect the privacy, dignity, well-being, and freedom of research participants. This duty requires both careful research design and informed consent from all participants. Risks and the possibility of harm to research participants must be carefully considered and, to the extent possible, these must be minimized. When there is a degree of risk or potential harm inherent in the re search, potential participants?organizations as well as individuals?must be informed. Informed consent means explaining to potential participants the purposes and nature of the research so they can freely choose whether or not to become involved. Such explanations include warning of possible harm and providing explicit oppor tunities to refuse to participate and to terminate partici pation at any time. Because students and employees are particularly subject to possible coercion, even when un intended, special care must be taken in obtaining their informed consent. Third-party review is one means of protecting the interests of research participants. Research plans involving human participants should be reviewed by an appropriate third party, such as a university human subjects committee or a focus group of potential partici pants. Questions regarding confidentiality or anonymity must be resolved between researcher and potential re search participants, both individuals and organizations; if confidentiality or anonymity is requested, this must be honored. Deception should be minimized and, when necessary, the degree and effects must be mitigated as much as possible. Researchers should carefully weigh the gains achieved against the cost in human dignity. To the extent that concealment or deception is necessary, the researcher must provide a full and accurate explana tion to participants at the conclusion of the study, in cluding counseling, if appropriate. Dissemination. It is the duty of journal editors and reviewers to exercise their position of privilege in a con fidential, unbiased, prompt, constructive, and sensitive manner. They have a duty to judge manuscripts only on their scholarly merits. Conflicts of interest may arise when a reviewer is in basic disagreement with the re search approach or the line of research represented by a manuscript. In such cases, the reviewer should consult with the journal editor to decide whether to accept or decline to review the manuscript. Protecting intellectual property is a responsibility of the reviewer and the edi tor. The content of a manuscript is the property of its authors. It is therefore inappropriate to use ideas or show another person a manuscript one has been asked to re view without the explicit permission of its authors. Ad vice regarding specific, limited aspects of the manuscript may be sought from qualified colleagues so long as the author's intellectual property remains secure. Sharing of reviewing responsibilities is inappropriate. The review is the sole responsibility of the person to whom it was assigned by the journal editor. In particular, students and colleagues should not be asked to prepare reviews unless the journal's editor has given explicit approval. Anyone contributing to a review should receive formal recogni tion. Constructive review means providing critiques and comments in a spirit of collegiality with thoroughness, timeliness, compassion, and respect, and in ways in tended to improve the quality of the manuscript. Grants and contracts. It is the duty of Academy mem bers to accurately represent themselves and their pro posed projects and to manage those projects as promised. Representation means accurate disclosure of one's level of expertise and expected actual involvement, the out comes that can be reasonably expected, the realistic funding level needed, and potential conflicts of interest. Grant and contract management requires independence and objectivity such that one does not compromise one's responsibilities or create conflicts of interest. One must also manage time and budget responsibly and use the funds as promised unless permission is explicitly granted to do otherwise. THE ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT AND THE LARGER PROFESSIONAL ENVIRONMENT The Mission Statement of the Academy describes member benefits and professional opportunities of mem bers which impose corresponding duties and service re sponsibilities. Sharing and dissemination of information. To encour age meaningful exchange, Academy members should fos ter a climate of free interchange and constructive criti cism within the Academy and be willing to share research findings and insights fully with other members. Academy participation. The Academy is a voluntary association whose existence and operations are depen dent on cooperation, involvement, and leadership from</page><page sequence="8">1190 Academy of Management Journal December its members. Members should abide by the constitution, bylaws, policies, and codes of the Academy. Members should consider offering their time and talent to carry out activities necessary to maintain the Academy and its functions. Officers and members should fulfill their Academy obligations and responsibilities in a timely, diligent, and sensitive manner, without regard to friend ships or personal gain. Members should honor all pro fessional commitments, including presentation of ac cepted papers and participation in scheduled roles as chair, discussant, or panel member. If absence from a scheduled meeting is unavoidable, members must con tact appropriate individuals and pursue suitable alterna tive arrangements. One should consider the impact one's projects or activities may have on the integrity or repu tation of the Academy, and one should not engage in such projects or activities that may have possible nega tive implications. Members should not imply that their work is sanctioned by the Academy unless an appropri ate Academy body has specifically done so. Commitment to professional standards of conduct. By this code, the Academy provides ongoing ethical guid ance for its members. Members should work to raise the consciousness of other members concerning ethical re sponsibilities, and they should encourage acceptance of these responsibilities. Members should notify appropri ate Academy officers or committees regarding the prac tices or actions of members they believe may violate Academy regulations or general standards of ethical con duct. In this manner, the aspirational and educational goals of this code are served through discussion of the ethical dilemmas and values of our profession. Strengthening and renewal of the Academy. The Academy of Management must have continuous infu sions of members and new points of view to remain viable and relevant as a professional association. Mem bers may contribute by encouraging all eligible individ uals to participate in the Academy and by assisting new and prospective members in developing their skills, knowledge, and understanding of their professional ob ligations. The professional environment for many Academy members includes the university community. The cen tral values which underlie appropriate university partic ipation are understanding, involvement, respect, fair ness, and the pursuit of knowledge. Participation in university leadership. Professors should take an active interest in university governance. Professors should be aware of university policies that affect the dissemination of policies. Professors should endeavor to positively influence policies relating to the quality of education and service to students. Active or ganizational involvement requires exercise of personal voting rights and respect for such rights of others, with out regard to rank or tenure. Professors should evaluate colleagues for purposes of promotion or tenure on the basis of appropriate academic criteria that are fairly weighted in accordance with standards understood by the faculty and the subject of evaluation. It is the duty of Academy members to treat their colleagues with respect and fairness. Members should safeguard confidential personal matters and avoid disclosing opinions ex pressed, attribution of statements, voting behavior, and outcomes. Members should address misunderstandings and conflicts with those directly involved and avoid speculative criticism that might damage the reputations of individuals or groups. When speaking or acting out side their university roles, professors should avoid cre ating the impression that they are speaking or acting for their university or its administration. Professors should dispose of complimentary books requested from publish ers by a manner other than sale. All Academy members, whether affiliated with a uni versity, business, governmental, service, or consulting organization, have an obligation to interact with others in a professional manner. Membership in the professional community. It is the duty of Academy members to interact with others in our community in a manner that recognizes individual dig nity and merit. The responsible professional promotes and protects the rights of individuals without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, handicap, sex, sex ual orientation, age, political beliefs, or academic ideol ogy, and refrains from sexual harassment. In the spirit of intellectual inquiry, the professional should welcome suggestions and complaints openly without reprisal. Members should ensure that outside activities do not significantly diminish their availability and energy to meet their institutional obligations. MANAGERS AND THE PRACTICE OF MANAGEMENT Consulting with client organizations ("clients") has the potential for enriching the teaching and practice of management, for translating theory into practice, and for furthering research and community service. To maximize such potential benefits, it is essential that members who consult be guided by the ideals of competence, integrity, and objectivity. Credentials and capabilities. It is the duty of consult ants to represent their credentials and capabilities in an accurate and objective manner. Consultants shall accept only those assignments for which they have appropriate expertise. Consultants shall refrain from exaggerating their professional qualifications to secure prospective assignments. Consultants shall examine any factors (e.g., prior experience, capabilities, other commitments) that might limit their judgment or objectivity in carrying out an assignment. University endorsement of the consulting activities of Academy members should not be repre sented or implied to potential clients unless the assign ment is formally under university sponsorship or is so approved. Obligations to clients. Consultants have a duty to ful fill their obligations to their present and prospective clients in a professionally responsible and timely man ner. Consultants shall place the highest possible priority on their clients' interests. Consultants shall avoid or withdraw from situations in which their clients' interests come into serious conflict with their own. Consultants</page><page sequence="9">2005 Code of Ethical Conduct 1191 shall not serve two or more competing clients without the consent of all parties. Consultants shall fully inform their clients. This means presenting results or advice in an unbiased manner and discussing fully with the client the values, risks, and limitations of the recommenda tions. Client relations. Consultants must fulfill duties of con fidentiality and efficiency as part of the relationship with their clients. Consultants shall maintain confidentiality with respect to their clients' identities and the assign ments undertaken unless granted permission by the cli ent. Consultants should exercise concern for the protec tion of clients employees and other stakeholders by maintaining, in particular, appropriate confidentiality. Consultants shall not take personal or financial advan tage of confidential information acquired as a result of their professional relationships or provide the basis upon which others may take such advantage. Consultants should meet their time commitments and conserve the resources utilized. Remuneration. It is the duty of consultants to negoti ate clear and mutually accepted remuneration agree ments for their services. Consultants shall provide a re alistic estimate of the fees to be charged in advance of assignments. Fees charged shall be commensurate with the services performed. Societal responsibilities. Consultants have a duty to uphold the legal and moral obligations of the society in which they function. Consultants should report to the appropriate authorities any unlawful activities that may have been uncovered during the course of engagements except where their functional professional code directs otherwise. Students and employees. It is the duty of the consul tant to safeguard student and employee rights when they are involved in consulting assignments. Consultants may involve students in work generated by engagements, es pecially if such work possesses learning potential, but students must not be coerced into participation. When they are so involved, students, as well as employees, should be fairly compensated and be made aware of the nature of the work they are doing. THE WORLD COMMUNITY As citizens of the world community, Academy mem bers may have much to contribute in shaping global consciousness by their teaching, research, and service. World view. Academy members have a duty to con sider their responsibilities to the world community. In their role as educators, members of the Academy can play a vital role in encouraging a broader horizon for decision making by viewing issues from a multiplicity of perspectives, including the perspectives of those who are least advantaged. As researchers, members of the Acad emy should consider, where appropriate, increasing their exposure to other cultures via travel, study, and research. Where appropriate, the research might highlight the re sponsible stewardship of the Earth's resources. In addi tion, members should take as a challenge the ongoing task of identifying evolving ethical issues by listening to those whose welfare is affected and by exploring the interaction of people and technology. In fulfilling their service responsibilities, members of the Academy should consider how they might lend their time and talent to enhance the world community through involvement in uncompensated public service. SEXUAL HARASSMENT The Academy of Management and its members are committed to providing academic environments that are free of sexual harassment and all forms of sexual intim idation and exploitation. Sexual harassment consists of unwelcome sexual ad vances, requests for sexual favors, and other visual, ver bal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: 1. It is implicitly or explicitly suggested that submission to or rejection of the conduct will be a factor in aca demic employment, admission, evaluation, or partic ipation in an academic activity. 2. The conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with an individual's academic or work performance, by creating an intimidating, hostile, offensive, or oth erwise unacceptable educational or work environ ment. The determination of what constitutes sexual harass ment depends upon the specific facts and the context in which conduct occurs. Sexual harassment takes many forms: subtle and indirect or blatant and overt; conduct affecting an individual of the opposite or same sex; be tween peers or between individuals in a hierarchical relationship; between teacher and student. Regardless of the intentions of the actor, the key question is always whether the conduct is unwelcome to the individual to whom it is directed. There are special risks in any consensual sexual or romantic relationship between individuals in inherently unequal positions (such as student and faculty, or junior and senior faculty). Relationships in which one party is in a position to review the work or influence the career of the other may constitute sexual harassment when that relationship gives undue access or advantage, restricts opportunities, or creates a hostile and unacceptable en vironment for others in the work or classroom environ ments. Furthermore, such relationships may be less con sensual than the individual whose position confers power believes, because of the complex and subtle effects of that power. Moreover, circumstances may change and conduct that was previously welcome may become un welcome. Even when both parties have consented at the outset to a romantic involvement, subsequent unwel come conduct may constitute sexual harassment.</page><page sequence="10">? Academy of Management Journal 2005, Vol. 48, No. 6, 1192-1195. Academy of Management Journal STYLE GUIDE FOR AUTHORS This "Style Guide for Authors" covers the format and language you should use for AMJ. To learn about desirable length and content for submissions, see "Information for Contributors," in each issue and at http://www.aom.pace.edu/amj/submission. html. For "Style Guide for Authors" on the Web, see http://aom.pace.edu/amJnew/style_guide.html. Manuscript Submission and Format Submit manuscripts to the editor, Sara Rynes, at amJ-srynes@uiowa.edu. See "Instructions for Elec tronic Submission," http://aom.pace.edu/amJIelec tronic.html. Please use Times Roman 12-point type and the 8V2 X 11 page setting; place page numbers in the upper right corner; and leave top and side margins of at least one inch. Publication Accepted papers are copy-edited and retyped. Authors review edits and proofread their work. AMJ's copy editor-production manager will con tact you after the editor assigns your work to an issue. Expect some time lag between acceptance and this contact. If your work is accepted, please keep the editor (amj-srynes@uiowa.edu) and the copy editor (pdoliner@twcny.rr.com) informed of changes in your contact information and long absences. Front Pages Address. Under the title of your work, list au thors' names, affiliations, and complete addresses. Example: AN EXCELLENT STUDY A. A. MANAGEMENT SCHOLAR Current University School and/or Department Building and/or Street City, State, Zip Code Tel: (000) 000-0000 Fax: (000) 000-0000 e-mail: scholar@univ.edu Acknowledgment. If you wish to acknowledge financial support or other assistance, add a note at the bottom of page 1, your title page. Abstract. An abstract of no more than 100 words and the title of the work go on page 2. Back Pages Group references and any appendixes, tables, and figures at the end of your manuscript. Continue your page numbering. Headings and Sections AMJ uses only three levels of headings. Use bold face for all three. Main headings (all capital letters; centered) are first. Second-level headings (title-style letters; flush left) are next. Third-level headings (first letter of first word capitalized; indented; italicized; and run into paragraph) are next. Don't skip steps: no second-level headings before you use a first-level heading, for instance. Use sec ond- and third-level headings in sets of two or more. Examples: METHODS [1st level] Data and Sample [2nd level] Measures [2nd level] Independent variable. [3rd level] Dependent variables. [3rd level] Footnotes Use footnotes, not endnotes. Hypotheses Fully and separately state each hypothesis you tested separately. Give it a distinct number (Hy pothesis 1) or number-letter (Hypothesis la) label. Set hypotheses off in indented blocks, in italic type. Examples: Hypothesis la. Concise writing has a positive relation ship to publication. Hypothesis lb. Following AMJ's "Style Guide for Au thors" has a positive relationship to publication. Language Technical terms. Help your work to be accessible to AMJ's wide-ranging readership. Define key techni cal terms. A technical term is a word or phrase that is not in a general-use dictionary with the meaning you (or even you and other published scholars) ascribe to 1192</page><page sequence="11">2005 Style Guide for Authors 1193 it. Put quotation marks around the first appearance in your paper of each technical term, or define it. Abbreviations. Avoid using them for the names of concepts. Use ordinary words for variable names?not code names or other abbreviations. Use the same name for a variable throughout your text, tables, figures, and appendixes. Names of organizations and research instruments may be abbreviated, but give the full name the first time you mention one of these. Names of software and some databases may be abbreviated. Reporting math. Do not "talk in math" in regular text. Use words. For instance, "We surveyed 100 employees," not "We surveyed n = 100 employees" and "We used a chi-square test to evaluate fit," not "We used a x2 test." Do use symbols and numbers to report results and give formulas. Italicize letters that are custom arily italicized [p, r, b, F, Z, and so forth). Use boldface italic for vectors. Put spaces around equals signs, minus signs, etc. Illustrative results within text go in parentheses. Introduce them with complete sentences. Example: One coefficient for the interaction was significant (model 3: ? = 0.06, p &lt; .05; model 5: ? = 1.06). Keep equations in your running text unless they contain oversized symbols or division, and/or are very important in your research. Examples: Run-in equation?We used Craig's (1992: 20) distance formula (d = xyz). Displayed equation? Pv(Yt = ytxt) =-y?T^&gt; (1) where Yt is. . . . Define each new term in all equations. Sexist or biased language. Avoid language that might be interpreted as denigrating. Do not use "he" or "she" exclusively. Using the plural? changing "the manager . . . he" to "managers . . . they"?is one solution; using "he or she" ("him or her") is another. Active voice and first person. Write in the active voice ("They did it") instead of the passive voice ("It was done") to make it easy for readers to see who did what. Use the first person ("I" or "we") to describe what you, or you and your coauthors, did. Examples: Passive (less desirable)?Two items were found to lack factor validity by Earley (1989). Active (more desirable)?Earley (1989) found that two items lacked factor validity. Third person (less desirable)?The author developed three new items. First person (more desirable)?I developed three new items. Anthropomorphism. Do not describe inanimate entities (models, theories, firms, and so forth) as acting in ways only humans can act. Appendixes Present long but essential methodological de tails, such as the calculation of measures, in an appendix or appendixes. Be concise. Avoid exact reproductions of surveys. Label appendixes "APPENDIX A," "APPENDIX B," and so forth. A substantive title, such as "Items in Scales," should follow. Label tables within ap pendixes "Table Al," "Bl," and so forth. Tables and Figures Look at tables and figures in published issues of AMJ to see preferred formats. For each table or figure, center "TABLE" or "FIG URE" with a number ("1," "2," etc.) at the top of the page. Put the title under this, also centered and boldface, but in upper- and lower-case letters. Number tables and figures consecutively (one se ries for tables, one for figures). Place them at the end of your manuscript, but indicate the position of each in the text as follows: Insert Table 2 about here Each table or figure needs an introductory sentence in your text. More on tables. Use more than one page if needed. Do not squeeze material onto one page by shrinking type. Don't use code names and abbrevi ations. Example: Desirable variable name?Profitability Undesirable variable name?PRFT Each table should report one type of analysis (which is identified in the title), and each vertical column and horizontal row should contain only one type of data. Report only two decimal places for all statistics. Place correlation coefficients in the lower-left cor ners of their tables.</page><page sequence="12">1194 Academy of Management Journal December Use superscript small letters to designate table footnotes. A lettered footnote may be used to sum marize significance levels: a All values greater than ... are significant at. . .. Or report significance levels in separate footnotes placed in a stack under your regular table footnotes. Example: tp &lt; .10 *p &lt; .05 **p &lt; .01 More on figures. Figures, unlike tables, have graphics. Make sure your figures will print out clearly so that they can be scanned. Do not use color. Use the same full variable names you use in your text and tables. Citations These are your in-text, in parentheses, identifi cations of other research. Every work that has a citation needs to have a corresponding reference (see "References," below). Examples: Name and year?Several studies (Adams, 1994; Bern stein, 1988, 1992; Celias, 2000a, 2000b) support this conclusion. Year only?But Van Dorn and Xavier (2001) presented conflicting evidence. Order. Order citations alphabetically. Designate two or more works by one author (or by an identical group of authors) published in the same year by adding "a," "b," and so forth, after the year. See the "name and year" example above. Multiple authors. If a work has two authors, give both names every time you cite it. For three through six authors, give all names the first time, then use "et al." in citations. Examples: First citation? (Foster, Whittington, Tucker, Horner, Hubbard, &amp; Grimm, 2000). Subsequent citation?(Foster et al., 2000). For seven or more authors, use "et al." even for the first citation. (But the corresponding reference should give all the names.) Page numbers in citations. Use this format: Writing a book is "a long and arduous task" (Lee, 1998: 3). Citation with no author. For an article with no author, cite the periodical as author. Example: Periodical as author?Analysts predicted an increase in service jobs {Wall Street Journal, 1999). For reports, handbooks, and the like, cite the "cor porate author" that produced them. Example: Organization as author?Analysts predict an increase in service jobs in the U.S. Industrial Outlook (U.S. Depart ment of Commerce, 1992). Such sources can also be identified informally. No corresponding reference will then be needed. Example: Informal citation?According to the 1999 U.S. Industrial Outlook, published by the U.S. Department of Com merce, service jobs will increase. Electronic sources. Use a regular citation (author, year) if you can identify an author of one of the types discussed above (human, periodical, or cor porate). If not, give the Web address that was your source in parentheses. No corresponding reference need be used in the latter case. References References are your entries in the alphabetical list at the end of your article or research note. This list should include only work you have cited. Order. Alphabetize references by the last name of a sole author, a first author, or an editor, or by the name of a corporate author (for instance, U.S. Cen sus Bureau) or periodical (such as the Wall Street Journal) if there is no human author or editor. Or der works by an identical author by year of publi cation, listing the earliest first. If the years of pub lication are also the same, differentiate entries by adding small letters ("a," "b," etc.) after the years. Repeat the author's name for each entry. Books. Follow this form: Last names, initials (separated by a space). Year. Title (Boldface italic, capitalize only the first letter of the first word and of the first word after a long dash or colon.) City where published: Name of publisher. (For small U.S. and Canadian cities, follow the name of the city with the postal abbreviation for the state or province; for small cities in other countries, give the full name of the country.)
