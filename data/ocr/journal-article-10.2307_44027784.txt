<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THING-LIABILITY (SACHHAFTUNG) IN EARLY LAW Geoffrey MacCormack* The two main theories place "thing-liability" at different points on the evolutionary graph. One puts it at the beginning and assumes that primitive man's instincts led him to seek revenge on an animal or object which had harmed him or his property or killed a member of his family (l). Hence the only obligation placed in the earliest law on the owner of an animal or object which had caused harm was to surrender it to the victim or his kin so that revenge might be exacted. As man became less primitive and more rational his mental horizons changed. He ceased to see the animal or object which had caused harm as itself a wrongdoer exposed to revenge; instead he looked at the owner of the animal or object and placed upon him an obligation to pay compensation for the harm caused, an obligation that might be avoided through the surrender of the animal or object. The other theory assumes, by contrast, that the starting point of legal development was the strict liability placed on the owner of the animal or object that had done harm (2). It appears to be based on a notion of causality ascribed to primitive man according to which harm caused by an animal or object is held to be caused by its owner. Hence he is placed under the same obligation he would have incurred had he himself committed the deed resulting in death or injury or damage. In the course of time the owner's liability becomes less strict. He is able to free himself from obligation by delivery of the animal or object which has caused the harm to the victim or his kin so that revenge may be exacted (3). ♦Professor of Jurisprudence, University of Aberdeen.

(3) I have over-simplified my account of these theories. Nor have I drawn attention to what appear to be inconsistencies in the view put forward by individual writers. Brunner, for example, certainly supposes that the animal was surrendered for the purpose of exac- tion of revenge and possibly (though this is less clear) holds the same view of the sur- rendered object. Yet he concludes his account with the statement: "Sucht man nach einem gemeinsamen Ausgangspunkt für die Auslieferung des Knechtes, des Haustieres und lebloser Gegenstande, so liegt die Vermutung nahe, dass ihr die Idee eines Opfers zugrunde liege, welches in Totschlagsfällen der Seele des Getöteten dargebracht werden sollte" C Deutsche Rechtsgeschichte II, cited note 1, 732). It is not at all clear that exac- tion of revenge and sacrifice to the soul of the deceased are the same, though compare Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law II, 2nd ed., 474, referring to Brunner.</page><page sequence="2">On Thing-Liability in Early Law 323 Either theory seems to me to founder on two basic difficulties. In the first place, there is the assumption that one can construct a clearly defined evolutionary progress holding good for all primitive and archaic societies. Whether one starts with the liability of the animal and object ( Sachhaftung ) or with the^ liability of the owner ( Herrenhaftung ) the mistake is to assume that everywhere a given state of affairs obtained, to be gradually replaced through defined stages by a less "primitive", more progressive state of affairs. The existing evidence does not suffi- ciently prove any such unilineal evolution and a priori grounds based on suppositions concerning primitive mentality are highly dangerous if not worthless. In the second place, the actual states of affairs upon which the theories focus lack empirical grounding. Both attribute importance, although in different ways, to the exaction of revenge and yet it is not at all clear from the evidence cited that revenge has anything to do with the matter at all. Part of the trouble, one suspects, is that it is very rare to find any thought given to the question, what exactly is meant by revenge? Other notions such as causality, atonement or expiation, pol- lution and sacrifice may also be invoked by protagonists of either theory. Again, one has to say that it is often very difficult to know precisely what is meant by recourse to these notions and where one can give some con- tent to the notion there usually appears a conspicuous lack of clear evidence. I have cited the evolutionary approach to the liability of animals and things not because I wish to examine it in detail but because I think it is an excellent illustration of the two main defects that characterise treatments of the topic: over-generalization and an uncritical use of assumptions about 'primitive' mentality. Many archaic legal systems contain rules which specify the fate of an animal or object that has killed or injured someone or otherwise caused harm. It is possible to say that under all these rules liability is imposed upon the animal or object. Hence one obtains the impression of a common factor, namely that of liability, and this in turn suggests the notion that there is some common reason accounting for or explaining liability such as the desire to inflict revenge. However, the essential point to remember is that the ascription of liability to an animal or object is simply a convenient way of referring, by implication, to a rule specifying its fate where it has caused harm. From the fact of liability alone one can deduce neither the actual fate of the animal or object nor the reason for it. As will be suggested below, the better procedure is to look at the rules relating to liability of animals and objects as far as possible in the context of the legal system to which they belong, and not to assume at the start of the investigation that the same reasons in all cases have prompted the enactment of the rules of the dif- ferent systems. No doubt there are similarities to be found in the content of the rules and no doubt in some cases the same reason will explain the development of the rules. But the latter point requires a greater degree of demonstration than it is usually accorded.</page><page sequence="3">324 The Irish Jurist, 1984 Equally desirable is the exercise of discrimination in the choice of reason advanced. If one comes to the conclusion that some notion, for example, vengeance or expiation, underlies a particular rule, it is not enough to introduce the notion as though it itself were perfectly self- evident. When we speak of vengeance are we thinking of the expression of an instinct or desire to harm something that has harmed us, typified in the kick given to a stone we have tripped over? Or are we thinking in a more dispassionate way of retaliation for a wrong, and, if so, what is to be understood by wrong? Does it involve the idea of personal guilt and so depend on the attribution of "souls" or "spirits" to animals and things (4)1 Is the flogging administered to the Hellespont on the orders of Xerxes to be regarded as the expression of a feeling of anger, as the punishment of the waters for their misbehaviour or as a symbolic act expressing the ruler's dissatisfaction with the progress of the campaign and at the same time relieving feelings of frustration (5)1 Similarly, the notions of "expiation" or "atonement" are shorthand ways of referring to complex sets of beliefs that may themselves be expressed by a further set of difficult terms such as contagion, purity, impurity, pollution, sacrifice and the anger of the gods. To cite expiation or atonement as an explanation for a rule is really no explanation unless the beliefs which give content to these notions are made clear. Even where some account of the relevant beliefs is given the explanation cannot be deemed satisfac- tory unless an attempt is made to show that the people who developed and operated the rule in fact held these beliefs. The question of proof is frequently made particularly difficult because the main or only evidence available to ascertain the nature of the beliefs is the very rule which is to be explained through the beliefs. Before these points are expanded and illustrated it may be as well to dispose of one preliminary matter, namely the extent to which assistance is to be derived from the customs of "primitive" people. Although I think that problems of archaic law may frequently receive illumination from a study of so-called primitive peoples of the present day or recent past, attempts of this sort which so far have been made in the context of liability of animals and things have not been happy. The reason is that the material cited as evidence of "primitive" custom has been drawn from uncritical compilations written before the era of modern (4) Cf. Holmes, Common Law , II; B.W. Leist, Graeco-italische Rechtsgeschichte (1884), 345 ne; Brunner, Forschungen , 516 n.4; G. Glotz, La solidarité de la famille dans le droit criminel en Grèce (1904, reprinted 1973), 178ff; R.

Hence the practice described cannot be relied upon as evidencing the belief for which it is instanced. One illustration may be given. In 1803 John Macrae wrote of the Kukis, a people from North Eastern India, in the following terms: "... like all savage people, [they] are of a most vindictive disposi- tion: blood must always be shed for blood; if a tiger even kills any of them, near a village, the whole tribe is up in arms, and goes in pursuit of the animal; when, if he is killed, the family of the deceased gives a feast of his flesh, in revenge of his having killed their relation. And should the tribe fail to destroy the tiger, in this first general pursuit of him, the family of the deceased must still continue the chase; for until they have killed either this, or some other tiger, and have given a feast of his flesh, they are in disgrace in the village, and not associated with by the rest of the inhabitants. In like manner, if a tiger destroys one of a hunting party, or of a party of warriors on a hostile excursion, neither the one nor the other (whatever their success may have been) can return to the village, without being disgraced, unless they kill the tiger. A more striking instance still of this revengeful spirit of retaliation is, that if a man should happen to be killed by an accidental fall from a tree, all his relations assemble, and cut it down; and however large it may be, they reduce it to chips, which they scatter in the winds, for having, as they say, been the cause of the death of their brother" (6). This passage is often cited not merely as evidence of the general practice followed by primitive peoples in inflicting vengeance on animals and objects which have caused harm but also as support for a "revenge" interpretation of rules found in some early codes. However, it cannot be regarded as reliable evidence even for the beliefs of the Kukis since there is no indication that the author made any proper investigation into this question (7). It is of still less value for a reconstruction of the beliefs that explain, for example, some of the provisions of the early Germanic codes. Investigations of tribal societies may well in the future yield interesting results of help in the reconstruction of the ideas underlying the liability of animals and things (8). But the material found in nine- teenth century accounts is more likely to mislead than illuminate. (6) I have transcribed the passage from Frazer, Folk-Lore III , 415f. It has had a con- siderable vogue. See also Tylor, Primitive Culture , 286 (cited from volume I of the 1958 reprint entitled The Origins of Culture ); Holmes, Common Law , 19; E.

(7) This is subject to some qualification as I have not been able to see the original account.

I have not attempted to compile an exhaustive list of the rules imposing liability on animals and objects. Since the crucial fact for the understanding of the data is the fate of the animal or object which has caused harm, I have classified the rules in accordance with this criterion and selected examples to illustrate the types of fate accorded the animal or object. I survey first the rules relating to animals, noting only those which can in some sense be said to make the animal liable for its act. The fate most frequently provided for the animal is that of surrender to the victim or his kin. This may obtain whether the animal has killed or injured someone or caused damage to property. It may operate in conjunction with, or as an alter- native to, a monetary payment or payment of some other kind. Several relevant provisions are found in the early Germanic laws. Those pro- mulgated by King Alfred for the Kingdom of Wessex in the latter part of the ninth century A.D. provide that where a beast injures a man its owner is to hand it over to the victim or come to terms with him (9). On the continent the two Frankish codes of the sixth century, the lex Salica and the lex Ribuaria which it influenced, both provide that where a quadruped kills a man it is to be handed over to the kin of the deceased as half the wergeld due, the other half to be paid by the owner (io). Among the Svears of Central Sweden the rule obtained that where an animal killed a man its owner was required to hand it over to the kin together with a payment (li). Among the East Goths in a different part of Sweden the rule was different. The owner of the animal was required to make payment to the kin but in lieu of payment the animal itself might be delivered unless it was a dog (12). The early Norse codes (13) provide that where an animal injures a man the owner is to hand it over to the vic- tim or, if he refuses to do so, to pay compensation as though he had (9) Alfred 24 (F.L. Attenborough, The Laws of the Earliest English Kings (1922), 75). (10) Lex Salica 36; Lex Ribuaria 46. The rule found in the Visigothic code of the late sev- enth century A.D. that the owner of an animal which injured a person or other animal ought to surrender it or pay compensation is probably derived from Roman law. See P.D. King, Law and Society in the Visigothic Kingdom (1972), 219 citing 8.4.12; 8.4.7. The same may be said of the rule of the Burgundian code providing that where one animal injures another the owner is to hand it over to the owner of the injured animal (18, and compare K.F Drew, The Burgundian Code (1949, reprinted 1972) 35 and n.2).

Roman law from at least as early as the Twelve Tables in the middle of the fifth century B.C. required the owner of an animal which had caused damage to surrender it to the victim or pay compensation (14). An obscure rule of Athenian law attributed to Solon in the early 6th century B.C. may have stated that a dog which had bitten someone should be delivered to him (15). Finally, one may cite two provisions from Scots law. A rule known in the thirteenth century pro- vided that if a horse killed someone with its hind feet, nothing was due to the kin of the person slain except the fourth part of the horse or a fourth part of its value (16). Balfour in the sixteenth century records a rule that the owner of any beast which harms a person is to pay compen- sation or surrender it to the victim (17). In other rules the primary obligation placed upon the owner of an animal which had killed or injured a person or caused damage is to kill it or drive it away. The Norse codes in particular contemplate the disposal of the offending animal. The Gulathing Law provided that the owner of a beast which had killed someone should "dispose" of it: should he keep and feed it, he is to pay a sum of money to the kin of the deceased (18). Another provision states that the owner of a dog that has bitten someone else's cattle may escape the obligation to pay a certain proportion of the value of the injured cattle if he "disposes" of the dog (79;. It seems also to be inferable from a section of the Frostathing Law that the owner of an animal that had injured a man might escape the obligation to deliver it to the victim if he "renounced ownership", presumably by driving the animal away and refusing to feed it (20). The effect of these rules is to release the owner from any obli- gation to the victim or his kin provided he kills or drives away the animal that has caused harm. A rather different series of rules looks at the matter from the point of view of the owner's liability in the future for harm done by an animal he knows to be dangerous. One of King Alfred's laws establishes the penalty to be paid in the case of injury by a dog where its master has kept it although he knows that it has inflicted injuries in the past (21). The Visigothic code also established a penalty to be paid by an owner whose dog had killed or injured someone where he (14) XII Tables 8.6 (Ulp. D.9.1.1.pr). (15) Plutarch, Solon 23.4.

The rules so far summarised look at the question of obligation purely as between the owner of the animal and the victim or his kin. Either the victim or his kin may be said to have a right to the animal or to payment, or the owner may be said to release himself from the obligation to sur- render the animal or to make a payment by killing or expelling it. Other rules take a different standpoint and involve the community or the state in the disposal of the animal. Considerable variation in the type of involvement is found. English law in the Norman period developed the institution of the deodand under which an animal which had caused the death of a human was forfeit to the crown, its value to be applied for pious uses (23). Scots law at one time had a similar rule. A source pre- serving the law of the fourteenth century provides that a fractious horse which throws and kills its rider is forfeit to the king (24). The archaic laws of the Near East illustrate a more drastic involvement on the part of the community. The best-known example is the biblical prescription relating to the goring ox (25). It seems as though members of the com- munity all take part in the stoning of the ox which has killed one of them. An obscure provision of the Hittite laws, perhaps of the thirteenth cen- tury B.C., provides that anyone who "sows seed upon seed" is to be yoked to oxen and torn apart and the oxen themselves are to be killed (26). A further example may be supplied by a rule belonging to the earliest Roman law, antedating the Twelve Tables, according to which a person who ploughs up a boundary stone is to be sacer together with the oxen (27). It is generally thought that the oxen were to be put to death. Sometimes the involvement of the community is signified in a par- ticularly solemn and formal manner as where the animal is put on trial, a verdict and sentence pronounced. In Athens the Court of the Prytaneion tried animals which had killed a human being. It is not known what fate a convicted animal incurred; possibly it was killed and its body cast beyond the frontiers (28). Most cases of the trial of animals come from Europe in the Middle Ages.

Domestic animals which had killed or seriously injured a human were tried in the ordinary courts and if con- victed were publicly executed. Such trials are found mainly in the period from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century and most frequently in France. On the other hand, ecclesiastical procedures were directed against species such as rats, mice, insects, locusts, or birds which con- stituted a menace. They were designed to prevent damage from taking place and, to this end, inflicted the penalties of curse and excommunica- tion. These procedures go back to the twelfth century and are found for several centuries thereafter. The material on the "liability" of inanimate objects is less extensive perhaps because most archaic legal systems recognise the element of "accident" or "chance" involved. A financial penalty is commonly imposed on the owner but generally less than would be payable if he had deliberately done the harm in question (30). However, rules which specify the fate of the object itself do occur. It is rare to find a rule requiring the object which has caused harm to be handed over to the vic- tim or his kin. One of the enactments contained in the Laws of Alfred provides that where one man kills another unintentionally by allowing a tree to fall on him while they are engaged in a common task, the tree is to be given to the dead man's kin (31). More frequently, one comes across rules whose point seems to be that an object which has caused the death of a human should be removed from human use. An early Norman col- lection of laws, the leges Henrici primi, in a case where A has taken B's weapons and killed someone or perhaps even caused some injury, implies that the weapons are "unclean"and not to be used by the owner until compensation has been paid (32). The same collection adopts a provision of the lex Ribuaria stating that where a man has been killed by a beam or other man-made object no compensation is payable unless someone appropriates the auctor inter fectionis to his own use (33). The notion that an object which has caused the death of a human should be removed from human use may underlie another rule developed at about the same period of English legal history. Where a man's death was accidentally (29) Von Amira, cited note 1 . See also Frazer, Folk-Lore III, chapter 6, and the material presented in E.P. Evans, The Criminal Prosecution and Capital Punishment of Animals (1906). (30) Cf. for example Gulathing Law, 169, 172-5 (Larson, Norwegian Laws , 135-6); lex Saxonum 54, 59; lex Frisionum 69; lex Gundababa 18.2; edictus Rothari 138, 144-5, 387. (31) Alfred 13 (Attenborough, Laws of the Earliest English Kings , 71). The rule reappears in the leges Henrici primi (90.6) and in that collection is followed by a rule (90.6a) stating that the same applies in the case of any object manufactured by man. However the latter statement forms the introduction of a provision stating that if a man has been killed in this way he is not to be paid for unless someone appropriates to his own use the auctor inter fectionis. Hence it is not clear whether the law primarily required the handing over of the object to the victim or his kin or was merely concerned with the imposition of a payment where the object was in fact used by someone.

Likewise, where one person deliberately killed another, the weapon, for example sword or dagger, was also forfeited to the crown and appears to have been treated as deodand (34). The most dramatic example of the liability of an object is furnished by the trials conducted in the Athenian court of the Prytaneion (35). If someone threw an object at another and killed him, the object itself was brought to trial if the person responsible was unknown or could not be found. Likewise if, without human intervention, a person was killed when an object fell on him, the object itself was tried. In both cases con- viction entailed the casting of the object beyond the frontiers of the state. Again, the rules about trial and conviction seem to be directed at secur- ing the removal of the object from human use. It is now time to review the views found in the literature, both ancient and modern, on the nature of the liability attaching to animals and objects. The variety of explanations found, at first sight, appears rather bewildering. They do, however, divide into two broad groups. In one the explanation offered focuses overtly upon the "primitive" and invokes a mode of thought or type of belief supposed to be characteristic of primitive peoples. A consequence is that the explanation is alien to the understanding of modern man. It is intelligible to him in the sense that he can understand how the mode of thought or belief in question could have been held. But at the same time it rests upon premises which to him are intrinsically erroneous, meaningless or absurd. By contrast, the other group contains explanations which make sense to modern man both in that he can comprehend how they could come to be held and in that they accord with his own perception of the universe, of the behaviour of man, animals and things and, in particular, of the relationship between cause and effect. Explanations from the first group lay particular stress upon the notions of vengeance and expiation. But other notions such as sacrifice, exorcism and causality may also play a role. The notion most generally found is that of vengeance, but it is not always applied in the same way. A writer who assumes that a primitive people wished to take vengeance on an animal or object which had caused death and therefore provided that it be handed over to the kin of the deceased may assume that the basis for the desire is instinct. A person, so this line of argument runs, naturally wishes to strike or destroy something which has hurt him or a (34) See footnote 23. Finkelstein, Temple Law Quarterly 46 (1973), 229 n. 194, points out that the forfeiture of the weapon used in deliberate killing is not to be explained as an application of the law of deodand but is a consequence of the rule that all the pro- perty of a felon might be confiscated by the crown. However, the early sources do not distinguish between forfeiture in the case of accidental death and that in the case of deliberate killing. Even in the later law where A killed a man with a sword belong- ing to B the sword was forfeit as deodand: Sir. E. Coke, The Third Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England (1797), ch. ix. (35) See note 28.</page><page sequence="10">On Thing-Liability in Early Law 331 close kinsman. Not until he has obtained such personal satisfaction will he obtain peace of mind (36). Hence the purpose of the delivery of the object or animal to him is to allow him to obtain personal satisfaction by treating it in any way he likes. However, the approach taken may reflect a different emphasis in that it is derived from the writer's belief that primitive peoples have an animistic conception of the universe. A thorough-going doctrine of animism may be maintained in which primitive peoples are thought to have ascribed "souls" or "spirits" not only to animals but also to inanimate objects (37). On this view, animals and things are treated rather like humans. The "spirit" dwelling in them should ensure that they behave properly and, in particular, that they refrain from killing or injuring humans. In so far as it fails in this duty it is to blame; the animal or thing has behaved wrongly and incurred guilt. Hence delivery to the victim or his kin constitutes the punishment of the animal or object. This point of view is perhaps more characteristic of the treatment of animals in early law than that of things. Part of the attraction of the "vengeance" theories is that they appear to explain the rule that the animal or object is handed over to the victim or his kin and not left for disposal by the community as such (38). Where the community is involved one is more likely to find explanations framed in terms of expiation or even sacrifice (39). The notion of expiation is related to the notion of pollution, and this in turn to the notion of the anger of the gods. However, the exact way in which these notions are related is usually far from clear. Sometimes one has the impression that the community is "polluted" by the presence of the animal or thing which has caused death simply in the sense that the gods are angry and will manifest their anger in a way detrimental to the community unless the animal or thing is removed or perhaps "sacrificed" to them. On this view pollution is understood to mean the fact that the gods are angry with the community. Yet logic appears to demand that the anger of the gods is a consequence of the pollution which has occurred. I shall attribute the more logical approach to writers who invoke the notions of pollution and atonement without further explanation. Pollution itself on this view is a complex notion. Its essence appears to be the fact that the animal or object has infringed the scheme of things established by the gods for the universe. More specifically, they have infringed a rule whose (36) Holmes, Common Law , lOf; von Amira, "Thierstrafen und Thierprocesse", cited note 1, 587f; Girard, Mélanges de droit romain II, 360f; Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law II , 2nd ed., 474; Frazer, Folk-Lore III, 444f: Glanville Williams, Liability for Animals , 9, 266.

Among these rules is that prohibiting the killing of a human; there are, of course, others as, for example, the rule of the early Romans prohibiting the displacement of boundary stones. Disturbance of the divinely established order is expressed in the language of purity. The community becomes "impure", "unclean" or "polluted". Therefore, the gods are angry and will express their anger in some unpleasant way unless the cause of the "impurity" or "pollution" is removed. Removal of the cause of pollution is expressed as expiation or atone- ment. It may take the form of physical expulsion from the community as in the case of the object convicted in the Prytaneion which is flung beyond the frontiers. Or the belief may prevail that the community may be purified and the anger of the gods averted only through the dedication to them of the animal or object which has disturbed the divinely ordained pattern. In the case of an animal, dedication may entail that it be put to death; it is said to be "sacrified" to the gods. Recourse to "primitive" notions of causality may also be made by way of explanation. Indeed, the animistic theories already referred to are derived in part from a conviction that primitive man attributes the behaviour of natural phenomena and animals to spirits dwelling within them. But a different type of causal belief may also be cited as an explanation of the "primitive" rules. This is the belief that an individual has "caused" a death or injury wherever it has been brought about by an animal or object which he owns. On this view, surrender of the animal or object to the victim or his kin is regarded as a mitigation of the original rule which required the owner to make the payment appropriate for loss of life or for the particular injury inflicted (40). The explanations falling into the second group attempt to find some element in the states of affair under consideration which appears rational to the investigator. One approach has been to suggest that liability is imposed on the owner rather than the animal or object which has caused death either because he is deemed to have been at fault in the control exercised over the animal or object or because he is made strictly liable in order to encourage him to exercise proper care and control (41). Alternatively, the concession is made, at least in the case of the animal, that it is liable, incurs guilt and suffers punishment. However, the notions of guilt and punishment should not be understood as they are when applied to humans. What is meant is that the animal is guilty in an objec- tive not a subjective sense. It has infringed a rule prohibiting the killing or injuring of persons or the inflicting of damage on their property and is guilty because it has caused death, injury or damage, not because it has (40) Cf.

So far as I can see modern investigators have not adopted this approach.</page><page sequence="12">On Thing-Liability in Early Law 333 exhibited a particular mental attitude (42). Cases in which the community are involved either in the trial of an animal or object or in securing its removal have attracted a variety of utilitarian explanations. The biblical rule concerning the goring ox has been interpreted as the means adopted by the community of ridding itself of a dangerous animal, that is, the ox is to be driven from the community by stoning (43). The trials held in the Prytaneion have been treated as analogous to proceedings in a modern coroner's court. Their purpose is to establish the cause of death and to take measures that will prevent a recurrence of the incident (44). What is one to make of this medley of opinion? At the outset it is helpful to keep in mind a basic distinction. A modern investigator may examine an institution or rule belonging to an early society and decide that it possesses certain functions. And in fact this may be a perfectly reasonable conclusion, granted that the point of view adopted is that of the external investigator. But it is quite another matter to determine the view held by those who participated in the society and operated the institution or rule. Their view may not have coincided with that of the modern investigator. There is no harm in the latter expressing his view of the function of a rule or institution provided he makes it clear that it is his view and not necessarily that of the members of the society in question. But possibilities of misunderstanding occur when it is not made clear whether the view expressed is the investigator's own opinion of the function of the rules or is his reconstruction of the opinion of those who operated the rule. Thus one might argue that the stoning of the goring ox rid the community of a dangerous animal or that the trial of objects and animals in the Prytaneion allowed the cause of death to be deter- mined and preventive measures taken for the future. But it by no means follows that those who stoned the ox or conducted the trial looked upon the matter in this light; or perhaps one should say looked upon it solely in this light. I am concerned-not so much with attempts to make sense of the rules of liability in terms that would be regarded reasonable today as with the recovery of the original attitudes to the extent that this may be possible. In conducting this inquiry one is faced with a double problem. There is, first, the obvious difficulty of evidence: how does one establish attitudes held by the members of a society that existed many centuries before one's own? The other problem is raised by the word "original". One may find that a particular rule is contained in a code promulgated at a certain time. One may suspect that the rule as it appears in the code is not the same (42) Cf. Lisowski and Condanari-Micheler, cited note 65. (43) T.H.

Once this position is asserted there is the possibility that the attitudes of the people have changed between the time of the hypothetical original rule and the time of the code in which a version of it appears. For example, some Frankish codes contain a rule providing that where an animal kills someone surrender of the animal may count as a propor- tion of the wergeld due. In this form the rule looks as though it treats surrender of the animal as compensation (45); the victim or his kin receive something of value and therefore are not entitled to the whole wergeld. However, if the assumption is made that at an earlier stage the rule simply provided for the surrender of the animal (an assumption, of course, for which there is no proof), one cannot equally assume that sur- render in this case was deemed to be compensation. The most sensible way of minimising the problems of the investigation is to confine each rule to the context in which it appears and to resist the temptation to reconstruct an earlier or more "primitive" form of the rule. Thus, in relation to the Frankish codes, it seems to me that one should deal only with the rules as found in the codes and not postulate an earlier version according to which the animal was required to be sur- rendered to the victim or his kin. With this in mind, I propose to look at some of the rules which have already been mentioned, not with the intention of offering a final solution but in the hope of making clear some of the issues that need to be considered. I turn first to the two laws from the Anglo-Saxon period contained in King Alfred's code, one dealing with death caused by a tree, the other with injury caused by an animal. It is probably a mistake to consider these provisions in isolation; they should be related to the other provi- sions in the code which deal with the killing and injury of humans. Where one person kills another, the basic principle operated by the code is that the former and his kin should pay the latter's price or wergeld to his kin. This principle is not as such stated but underlies the particular cases which are dealt with. Where a person inflicts an injury on another, the code establishes in detail the amount which is to be paid by way of compensation, listing a wide range of possible injuries and fixing the amount appropriate to each. In all these cases the assumption appears to be that one person has directly by his own act killed or injured another. There is little reference to the degree of fault necessary to establish liability (46). Generally speaking, deliberately inflicted death or injury appears to be envisaged, but it is possible that the same compensa- tion was payable even though there was no malice except where obvious justifications like self-defence could be pleaded. In other words, cases of accidentally or carelessly caused death or injury may, from the point of (45) Lex Salica 36: Lex Ribuaria 46. (46) Cf., however, Alfred 36 (Attenborough, Laws of the Earliest English Kings, 81) which exempts a man from blame if another runs onto the point of a spear he is carrying provided the spear is carried level on the shoulder with the point to the rear.</page><page sequence="14">On Thing-Liability in Early Law 335 view of payment of compensation, have been treated in the same way as that deliberately caused provided the act was clearly that of the person made liable (47). Problems, however, arose in certain cases where death or injury has occurred and yet could not be clearly attributed to the act of any par- ticular persons. All such cases may not have been treated in the laws, but some were of sufficient importance, perhaps because of the frequency of their occurrence, for regulation to be necessary. It is from this point of view that the "liability" of the tree and the animal should be regarded. Where a group of woodcutters were engaged in felling trees and a tree falls and kills one of them, the act which causes death is the fall of the tree and is not something directly done to the person killed by any par- ticular individual. Hence the case is not one which requires the payment of wergeld. On the other hand, it is not thought fair that the kin should be without all compensation; the most appropriate form this can take is in the provision of the object which has caused the death. The kin are entitled to remove and keep the tree which presumably is of some value (48). The same considerations apply to injuries caused by animals which are owned. The injury is not the act of the owner and so he cannot be made liable for payment of compensation in the normal way through the operation of the fixed tariff system. The law provides, again approp- riately, that he should hand over the animal or make some other arrangement with the victim (49). How, then, should one explain the dif- ferent rule established by the code for injuries caused by dogs? The owner is to pay a fixed sum by way of compensation and if he keeps the dog and it subsequently injures someone again the amount payable is increased (50). The answer lies, I think, in the degree of control which a (47) See generally Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law I, 2nd ed., 46f, 52f. (48) Alfred 13. This provision is sometimes explained in terms of revenge to be taken on the tree: Holmes, Common Law , 19; F. Liebermann, Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen 7/(1906), 301, Baum 6; Brunner, Deutsche Rechtsgeschichte II, 2nd ed., 731 and n.40, and compare Forschungen , 522. Glanville Williams, Liability for Animals, 267 remarks: "Here the tree is regarded as being primarily liable for the death and must be surrendered in expiation". Apparently, expiation is used in the sense of delivery for exaction of revenge. Cf. also Finkelstein, Temple Law Quarterly 46 (1973), 181 where the delivery of the tree is explained "not as a true restitution for the damage done, but as a ransom by the owner of the wrong-doing chattel in order to forestall further action by the injured party". (49) Alfred 24. Liebermann cites this as an example of Tierstrafe by which he means the delivery of the animal for the exaction of revenge. Cf. the reference given in the preceding note together with the entry under Tierstrafe 2 at 684 of the same volume. Glanville Williams, op. cit., 27 If assumes that this is a correct interpretation of the original rule though he adds that the position may have been different in the time of Alfred. However, he argues that the beast cannot have been intended as compensation because the obligation on the owner was either to surrender it or pay its value. As to this two points may be made. First, it is not clear that the law specifies the value of the beast rather than some other agreed payment, and second, even if the reference were to the value of the beast, it is not shown how this could not be deemed compensa- tion once this term is not restricted to the making good of an economic loss by pay- ment of an equivalent. See further on this below. (50) Alfred 23, on which cf. Glanville Williams, op. cit., 274f.</page><page sequence="15">336 The Irish Jurist , 1984 master is expected to maintain over his dogs. He has a much closer con- nection with his dogs than he does, say, with the beasts in the field. Con- sequently, it is not unreasonable to treat the act of the dog as in effect his own act and impose an obligation to pay a fixed monetary compensa- tion. Yet the case is not the same as that in which a person inflicts a wound, and so the compensation is related not to the nature of the injury but to the seriousness of the owner's failure to control his dogs. In these provisions it is difficult to see any notion of vengeance or any trace of an animistic doctrine according to which the tree and the animal are believed to contain "souls" responsible for their acts. Further, it is possible to see why the tree or animal is to be handed over to the victim or his kin, or, at least, why neither was removed from human use. The case of the tree is particularly interesting from this point of view because a human was in fact killed. However, the circumstances under which the tree falls shows that there was nothing 4 'unnatural" or "inexplicable" in the accident. The tree fell only because it was chopped down by humans and hence there is no reason to remove it from human contact because in falling it killed someone. One does not know the fate of an animal that had killed. It is possible that it was itself killed or driven away. But even if this were the position one can see that the infliction of an injury by an animal need not have been treated in the same way. The regulations relating to a dog that has bitten a man (51) imply that if the owner drives it away after it has bitten he will not be liable for subsequent bitings. In this case the explanation for the rule is probably that a man who know- ingly keeps a dangerous animal should be made liable for harm that it causes; that is, liability is based upon personal fault. The leges Henrici primi contain several provisions on the liability of a person for harm done by his weapons. Among these occur references to weapons being "clean" or "free from guilt". Thus where someone appropriates another's weapons and causes injury with them the owner is not to accept them back until they are clean (in omnis calumpnia munda) (52). It appears that they became "clean" when compensation had been paid for the injury. With this may be compared the position obtaining where a "man-made object" (manufictilis) has accidentally caused someone's death. No compensation is to be paid unless someone puts the object to his own use (53). The idea behind these provisions seems to be that the weapons which caused death or injury are "unclean" in the sense that they are debarred from human use (54). One might, of course, hold that the idea is to be distinguished from the pic- (51) The law probably does not contemplate a case of killing but the matter is doubtful. See Glanville Williams, op. cit., 274 n.5. (52) 87.2c and cf. 87.3 (Downer, Leges Henrici Primi, 265). (53) 90.6a (Downer, op. cit., 281). (54) Cf. the remarks of Brunner, Forschungen , 521; Deutsche Rechtsgeschichte II, 2nd ed. 73 If, though the Norse superstition which he cites does not seem completely in point as there is no reason to suppose that the weapons were treated as idols endowed with a "holy" power.</page><page sequence="16">On Thing-Liability in Early Law 337 turesque language in which it is clothed. The notion of being "unclean" may be taken simply as a way of saying that the object should not be used until payment of compensation has been made. But I think there is more to the idea than this. In the case of the "man-made object" causing death the rule appears to contemplate that no compensation need be made; only if someone does use the object does he incur the obligation to pay compensation. It is not unlikely that the person who used the object was deemed to adopt the "guilt" attaching to it. Consequently, description of the object as impure is not merely indirect expression of the fact that it may not be used until its owner or possessor pays compen- sation. It seems to me probable that at the basis of the idea of impurity is an instinctive aversion to an object that has caused the death of a person. In the case of the "man-made object" one can see that the dominant wish may have been to place it beyond the sphere of human contact. At least this would be so where the death caused by the object was not due in part to the type of human intervention illustrated in the case of the woodcutters. However, such a desire was sensibly tempered by economic considerations. If the object was useful to man, a means was found by which it could be reclaimed for human use. Use was held to entail the acceptance of responsibility for the death, and hence the user was placed in the normal position of a man who had killed: he incurred the obliga- tion to pay the appropriate wergeld. The position in the case of the weapon is not quite the same. The function of a weapon is to kill or injure. Hence there may not be the same strong desire to exclude it from human contact. However, where the death or injury has been caused without justification, in particular through a deliberate act, the idea is present that the weapon, as impure, should not be used again until com- pensation has been paid. Possibly the same notion of instinctive aversion applies but there is certainly an expectancy that the weapon will be used again, and so the emphasis is placed not upon its departure from the human sphere but upon the obligation of the person who wielded it to pay compensation. The significant point is that the weapon was taken by someone without the owner's permission. There was a possibility that it might be used to kill or injure and then be abandoned. To this extent it might be approximated to the position of the "man-made object". If the person who took the weapon could not be found, the position is that the owner would want it back and yet it should not be placed into human circulation again until compensation had been paid. The law may have had the effect in many cases of compelling the owner to pay if he wanted his weapon back. The earliest authority on the English law of deodands is Bracton. When dealing with the hue and cry to be raised on the discovery of a felony, he distinguishes the case of a man who has been crushed or drowned or has died in some other way from misadventure. In this case the hue should be raised but there need be no pursuit since the malefactor</page><page sequence="17">338 The Irish Jurist , 1984 or 4 'bane" has been arrested (55). The noun "la bane" is a version of the Anglo-Saxon word bana used in the laws to denote slayer. The records of the cases heard in England before the justices in eyre in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries show many instances of weapons, carts, cauldrons, boats, animals, mill-stones and other objects being declared forfeit to the crown on the ground that they have caused someone's death. No distinction is made between the case in which the death has been brought about accidentally, as through a fall from a horse or a boat, and that in which it has been caused deliberately by use of a weapon (56). Early writers on the common law appear to have explained deodands in religious terms as property to be used for the benefit of the soul of the deceased or the souls of the king's ancestors (57). This is still the point of view represented by Blackstone although he supplies an additional reason for the forfeiture of animals, namely that their owners have in fact been at fault (58). However, more modern authorities have attempt- ed to uncover the "originar' idea underlying the institution, and emphasised the "guilt" attaching to the object or animal which has caused death. Thus Pollock and Maitland, founding on the words of Bracton, state: "In accordance with ancient ideas this bane, we take it, would nave gone to the kinsmen of the slain; the owner would have purchased his peace by a surrender of the noxal thing; but what we have said above about intestacy (ii. 356) will prepare us to see that in the thir- teenth century the claim of a soul which has been hurried out of this world outweighs the claim of the dead man's kinsfolk, and in the past they will have received the bane, not as a compensation for the loss that they have suffered, but rather as an object upon which their vengeance must be wreaked before thé dead man will lie in peace" (59). I am not sure that it is possible now to uncover the complex processes that may have contributed to the development of the law of deodands. But some observations may be made. The earliest time for which any knowledge is available is that of Bracton. Therefore, the most one can (55) Bracton, De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae, 116.

There is, it is true, some justification for the postulation of a still earlier period in which the animal or object was handed over to the kin of the person slain. The provisions from the laws of Alfred already considered may provide some support for such an hypothesis. Nevertheless, I do not think one is warranted in supposing a line of development under which the regular surrender of the animal or object to the kin of the deceased was replaced by its forfeiture to the crown as deodand. One cannot be sure that in the pre-Bractonian period animals or objects causing death were regularly surrendered to the kin of the deceased. It is a mistake to generalise from the particular cases put in the earlier laws. Equally, one might point to indications in the leges Henrici primi that the object caus- ing death was to be barred from future human use, and treat this as an indication of the basis out of which developed the institution of the deodand. Again, however, any such inference or postulated line of development should be avoided. There is insufficient evidence on which to construct any evolution of the type from X to Y, where X stands for some single state of affairs, whether surrender to kin or removal from human use. Can anything be inferred of the way Bracton himself understood the deodand? Although he spoke of it as 'malefactor' or 'bane', one cannot properly deduce that he regarded it in any 'primitive' light by ascribing 'guilt' to it or assuming that it had behaved in some way like a human. He is discussing basically the hue and cry raised against those suspected of having committed a felony, and contrasts the position where death has been caused through misadventure. A parallel is drawn between the human malefactor and the animal or object to which the term 'bane' is applied. It is the juxtaposition of the case of misadventure with that of felony that probably accounts for Bracton's use of language. Indeed, one may note that in another, corrupt passage he appears to attribute the cause of death not so much to the animal or object as to a person who has behaved foolishly (60). Personally, if one is to search for ideas or beliefs underlying the rule about deodands, I would prefer that which holds the animal or object should be removed from human use to that which treats it as a 'guilty' object to be handed over to the kin for the exaction of vengeance. However, it does not seem possible to draw any firm conclusion (61). (60) Bracton, 137, and compare the Thorne edition, cited note 55, 384 and notes 21-2, referring to the different interpretation of Pollock and Maitland, op. cit., 474n. (61) Cf. what has been written by the most recent investigator of the subject; "the real rationale for the deodand institution lay in the assumption by the state ... of the role of vicar of transcendent concerns and values, superseding the Church in most of its authority in these domains. Foremost among these is the belief in the transcendental value of human life . . . When, however, a human life has been taken . . . the Crown annexed to itself the prerogative of representing the divine authority to which the cor- porate community believed itself to be ultimately answerable" (Finkelstein, Temple Law Quarterly 46 (1973), 183 and see also his remarks at 2490.</page><page sequence="19">340 The Irish Jurist, 1984 The provisions of the lex Salica and lex Ribuaria which provide for the delivery of an animal which has killed a man to the kin and treat this as equivalent to payment of half the man's wergeld are readily explicable in terms of compensation. This is shown by the correlation made in the laws between the animal and a certain proportion of the wergeld (62). The Swedish and Norse laws provide a more complicated assortment of data. Several situations may be distinguished. Svear law requires the animal which has killed and a payment to be handed over to the kin of the victim. The East Gothic law permits the delivery of the animal in lieu of payment. In Norway the laws allow delivery of the animal which has injured a person but may have permitted the owner to escape any obliga- tion if he refused to feed the animal. But where the animal has killed the Gulathing law provides that it is to be driven away and further provides that the owner of a dog which has bitten another's cattle may escape the obligation to pay compensation if he drives it away. It is worth observing, in the first place, that there is nothing to suggest that the underlying idea was the delivery of the animal to the victim or his kin for the purpose of the exaction of revenge. Animals were valuable commodities and hence furnished an appropriate means by which a vic- tim might be compensated for his injury or his kin for his loss. The fact that it was always the beast causing the harm that was delivered does not show that the idea of revenge predominated, or that the idea of compen- sation is to be excluded. The word compensation is itself somewhat vague. Nowadays, one thinks of compensation as the making good of the economic loss suffered by a person. An equivalence is presupposed between the extent of the loss and the amount of the return. However, compensation may also be used in the sense of a payment made in money or goods to a person who has been wronged where either the amount or the kind of payment is such that it is deemed to be an appropriate return. What constitutes an appropriate return is not necessarily determined purely by economic considerations. In societies which do not have developed or sophisticated economies it is a perfectly natural sequence of thought to treat the animal which has caused the harm as itself the appropriate return. That even so some adjustment might be possible is shown not only by the provisions of the lex Salica and lex Ribuaria but also by the Svear law requiring, in a case of death, payment as well as delivery of the animal. The old Norse rule which places upon the owner of an animal that has killed a human the obligation to drive it away or make a payment to the (62) J. Grimm, Deutsche Rechtsaltertümer //, 4th ed. (1922), 234 comments on these pro- visions: "wahrscheinlich damit die verwandten des getödteten das verhasste thier umbringen könnten, mit dessen lebendigen besitz ihren gewis nicht gedient war". It is true that an animal that had once killed a human might be regarded as too dangerous to be allowed to live but one cannot be quite sure about this. Whether the animal was put to death or not may well have depended upon the circumstances in which the person had been killed. In any case even a dead animal might possess some value.</page><page sequence="20">On Thing-Liability in Early Law 341 kin is difficult to interpret. No details are mentioned which suggest that the animal was regarded as an object of abhorrence to be expelled from the human community. From this point of view it is perhaps significant that the initiative rests with the owner alone; the community itself is not involved in the disposal erf the animal. Yet one cannot be sure that the practical need to remove a dangerous animal was the only factor accounting for the rule. It is possible that some causal notion is present such as the notion that the owner is deemed to have caused the death and so be responsible for it unless he dissociates himself from the actual instrument (63). The case of the dog that has bitten cattle is also difficult. Certainly, it is unlikely that any instinct of revulsion or aversion deter- mined the fate of the dog. There may again have been some combination of a belief that the deed of the dog was the deed of the owner unless he ceased to feed it, and the need to remove a dangerous animal. Early Roman law has two provisions relevant to the liability of animals. The first permits the noxal surrender of a quadruped which has committed pauperies and the second (very different in character) declares sacer the oxen (together with their driver) which have dislodged a boun- dary stone. The dominant view with respect to pauperies is still probably the conviction that originally, that is, at some archaic period prior to the Twelve Tables, the animal was believed to be guilty in that it was activated by a 'demon' or 'spirit' and hence was to be delivered to the kin for the exaction of revenge (64). To some extent this view is depend- ent on the once prevalent but now obsolete theory of animism according to which primitive peoples endowed the phenomena of the universe with spirits. But even if the animistic part is discarded, there still remains the notion of surrender for revenge (65). Again one finds it impossible to ascertain the attitudes characteristic of early Roman society. But there are demonstrable economic considerations which detract from the (63) The lex Gundobada 18.1 states: Si quodcunque animal quolibet casu, aul morsus canis homini mortem intulerit, iubemus etiam inter Burgundiones antiquam exinde calumpnian removeri, quia quod casus operator, non debet ad dampnum aut inquietudine *n hominis pertinere.

Other writers are prepared to speak of the guilt and punishment of an animal and of the exaction of revenge, but emphasise that the animal is not regarded as having a will; rather it is a question of 'objectively wrong* behaviour in that the animal has broken the law by causing damage.

Domestic quadrupeds were a valuable species of property in Rome at the time of the Twelve Tables, and, indeed, the fur- ther one goes back in time the more valuable, relatively, they would have been. If one adds to this fact the consideration that the owner had not himself caused the damage, it does not seem strange that the most appropriate compensation for the damage done by the animal was represented by the animal itself (66). One could note further that pauperies was concerned with damage to property, including injuries to slaves, but originally did not concern the death or injury of a free per- son (67). If an animal killed or injured a free person it is possible that it was killed; it might, at any rate in the case of injury, have been handed over to the victim. But there is no ground for believing that the notion of revenge on the animal would have determined its fate. Interpretation of the provision relating to the oxen who plough up a boundary stone depends upon the meaning assigned to sacer . The view most often found is that the oxen became forfeit to the angry gods; they now belong to the gods, should be killed and despatched to them. This view may be expressed in the language of expiation, sacrifice or punish- ment (68) and yields again the conclusion that the animal was believed to have acted wrongly in much the same way as a human. There is too much supposition in this view. It is not really clear what were the conse- quences of becoming sacer. Certainly, the basic idea seems to have been that the oxen had trespassed upon or infringed the domain of the gods and hence were now removed from the human sphere. But what is not clear are the practical consequences of such a state. The oxen may have been turned adrift from the community or they might have passed into ownership of the priests or they might have been redeemable by their owner for some payment (69). Under these circumstances it is highly doubtful whether one can apply to the case of the oxen ideas of guilt or punishment. Even if one were to speak of expiation or sacrifice on the assumption that the oxen were devoted to the gods and killed, one cannot deduce the existence of a belief that the animals possess spirits or have the capacity to distinguish between right and wrong. In so far as there has been an act committed which angers the gods the appropriate means of atonement is presented by the animals engaged in the act (70). (66) Cf. Modrzejewski, cited note 64, 188f; Lebigre, cited note 65, 17f. (67) The action was later extended to cover injuries to a free person. Cf. Gaius D.9.1.3 and Lebigre, op. cit., 24 n.5; B.S.

The salient factors are that objects thrown by someone who was not known or could not be found or objects which had fallen on someone or animals were tried in this court where a person had been killed, that conviction of an object entailed its being cast beyond the frontiers and that conviction of an animal probably entailed its being put to death and also cast beyond the frontiers (71). Of these the most significant for the determination of the ideas underlying the procedure is the ultimate fate of the object or animal. Casting beyond the frontiers suggests that the main purpose of the trial was to secure the exclusion from human use, or at least the community's use, of an object or animal which had brought about the death of a human. Although this conclusion may readily be inferred from the data, a further question less easily resolved arises. Why was it necessary that the object or animal be excluded from human use? Is it because human life stands under the pro- tection of the gods? On this view an object or animal which had caused death in circumstances where no human could be made responsible may be regarded as arousing their anger. The consequences of the divine anger may be averted only through the banishment of the cause from the community (72). I cannot say that I find appealing an explanation of this type. Or at least it is not satisfactory as a comprehensive explanation. The reason is that it overlooks what appears to be a more basic or natural fact, namely the instinctive aversion to something which has caused the death of a human, and the consequent need to remove it from the com- munity. In the case of an animal there is a further fact which has an obvious relevance. An animal which has once killed may do so again and needs to be removed as a danger to the community. There still remains the point that the object and animal are made the subject of a trial in a court presided over by certain officials whose functions were mainly religious ( basileus and phylobasileus). Does one need to see in this procedure a solemn investigation by those charged to ensure that the state is kept free from pollution? If one understands by pollution the notion that the killing infringes the scheme of things developed and approved by the gods and hence calls forth their anger, one cannot say that this notion played no part in the Athenian concep- tion of the court's role. But it by no means follows that the same notion determined the treatment accorded animals and objects which had killed. The accounts of the court's jurisdiction which have been preserved sug- gest that its primary function was to investigate cases of death caused by (71) Plato, Laws , 873E. (72) This may be in part what writers who speak of pollution mean (MacDowell, Athenian Homicide Law , ch. xiv; Harrison, Law of Athens I, 43). See also von Amira, 'Thierstrafen und thierprocesse", cited note 1, Sili; Diill, ZSS 61 (1941), 7ff; Finkelstein, Temple Law Quarterly 46 (1973), 229 n.l93; J.

Poliakov (1975), 91f.</page><page sequence="23">344 The Irish Jurist , 1984 a human who was unknown or was known but could not be found (73). It is not surprising that the same venue was chosen for the investigation of death brought about by a non-human agency. Even if one assumes that the notion of pollution is applied to the killing of a human by another, one ought not to assume it was equally applicable or applicable in the same way where a human had been killed by an object or animal. It is necessary to distinguish the instinctive aversion to an object which has caused the death of a human from the concept of pollution. This is not to say that the instinct may not have played a part in the formulation of the scheme of things regarded as specifically enjoined by the gods. Not very much is to be made of the law ascribed by Plutarch to Solon according to which a dog that had bitten someone is to be fastened into a collar or yoke and delivered up, presumably to the injured person. The law does not seem to have contemplated cases in which the dog killed a person; otherwise the trial in the Prytaneion would appear to be the appropriate procedure. It is not possible to determine whether the point of the law was to hand over the dog as compensation to the victim or whether it was designed as a public order measure to keep vicious dogs under control. Of the Near Eastern laws that most discussed in the present context is the biblical provision on the goring ox; when an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be clear (74). A wide range of opinion is to be found in the literature. Sometimes the ox is assumed to have been treated much as a human, that is, punished as a murderer (75); sometimes its stoning is regarded more as a cult act by which expiation is made and the anger of the gods averted (76), and sometimes a frankly utilitarian explanation is invoked based upon the necessity of removing a dangerous animal from the community (77). Again the problem is one of assessing the degree of plausibility possessed by these various explana- tions. All to some extent depend upon presumptions which cannot directly be proved or disproved. However, the first two explanations seem to me of relatively little weight since they are derived from assump- tions concerning the nature of animals or the relationship between animals and the gods for which there is really no evidence. It is not poss- ible to demonstrate the existence of the particular beliefs which form the content of the assumptions. Nor, of course, is it possible to prove that the people who operated the rule thought of it as derived from the need to rid the community of a danger. But there is intrinsically a greater degree of plausibility about the utilitarian approach since it is necessary (73) Cf. the remarks of D. Daube, Roman Law: Linguistic, Social and Philosophical Aspects (1969), 168. (74) Exodus 21.28. (75) G.R. Driver and J.C. Miles, The Babylonian Laws I (1952), 444.

However, I am not sure that one should rest content with this purely practical consideration. It may have played some part in the deter- mination of the fate meted out to the ox. But probably the more basic or primary notion was that which looked upon an ox (or perhaps any other domestic animal) that had taken life with a particular abhorrence; there was an instinctive revulsion manifested in the exclusion of the ox from the human community. Nor can one ignore the possibility that some specific belief with respect to the attitude of God may have prevailed even though one is unable to determine with certainty the con- tent of such a belief (78). The Hittite laws contain a series of provisions which have been inter- preted in terms of revenge and punishment directed against a guilty animal (79). But I think it can fairly readily be seen that the particular provisions do not really warrant such an interpretation. Thus it is pro- vided that where oxen stray into a field the owner may yoke and use them for one day before returning them (80), that where a pig strays into another's property and the owner strikes it so that it dies he shall return the body to its owner (81). Both seem to be intelligible as they stand. Use of the oxen for a day is an appropriate means of compensation for the trespass; the rule about the pig seems designed to specify the conse- quences of a resort to self-help in which the pig is killed. Another pro- vision presents more of a problem. In the translation of E. Neufeld it reads: "If anyone sows seeds upon seeds, they shall put him to a plough and they shall harness a yoke of oxen directing the face of this one this way, and the face of that one that way. The man shall die and the oxen shall die, and he who first sowed the field shall take it" (82). It does not seem that the oxen to which the sower is yoked are those which have been employed in sowing the land. Hence one cannot assume that the oxen were put to death because they participated in the offence of sowing the land and hence incurred punishment for a wrongful act. Rather, the idea seems to be that the oxen are to be killed because they can no longer be part of the community as they have been used to kill one of its members. In other words, much the same idea may be present as in the case of the biblical goring ox. Sometimes the explanation is offered that the oxen have become 'impure' through contact with the offender and hence are to be put to death (83). This may be getting at the same idea but I think it preferable to put the emphasis on the con- (78) See the instructive remarks of Modrzejewski, "Hommes et bêtes", cited note 72, lOOf and compare Finkelstein, Temple Law Quarterly 46 (1973), 180f.

Almost certainly no single factor can account for this phenomena. Von Amira deduces from the circumstances of trial and execution that the animal was punished and concludes that it was regarded as a wrongdoer to whom a wrongful intention was ascribed (84). He cites support for this view from an early French source but points out that other views are represented in the later sources* for example, that all trace and memory of the evil deed should be removed and that owners should be induced to exercise greater care in the control of their animals. Generally, he argues that a progression can be seen from the view that the animal itself is punished to the view that the owner is punished. He rejects the idea that the source of the medieval trials is to be found in the archaic Germanic rules requiring delivery of the animal to the victim or his kin for the exaction of revenge, because similar rules are still found existing alongside those providing for the public trial and execution of animals. The inspiration for the latter rules lies in the biblical lex dei exemplified in the case of the goring ox. Biblical law treated the stoning of the animal as a ťcult acť. According to von Amira the medieval conception was different in that it treated the animal as a wrongdoer subject to punishment. The ecclesiastical procedures and sanctions against plagues of rats and the like he interprets in a different fashion. These are essentially magical processes designed to counter the harm threatened by the souls of men or demons believed to dwell in the animals. I am not competent to pass a final judgment on von Amira's conclusions, but some appear to be more plausible than others. I think he is right in rejecting a "revenge" basis for the trials, but I cannot see the force of an argument which postulates a specific connection between the biblical and the medieval rules (85). What is common to both is the fact of community involvement in the disposal of the animal. To me what this suggests is that both in biblical and medieval times the underlying factor was the need to rid the community of an animal which had killed a human. The need itself is probably derived from two elements, the instinctive aversion to the agent of death and the fear that the animal might kill others, although it is impossible to be sure what weight at any given time was attached to either element. The point is that the means to dispose of the animal is dependent upon the social conditions which prevail in the community. In biblical times it was sufficient for the families concerned and their neighbours to take concerted action and stone the ox. On the other hand, the countries of (84) See generally von Amira, "Thierstrafen und Thierprocesse", cited note 1. (85) Cf. however, Brunner, Deutsche Rechtsgeschichte II, 2nd ed., 730 n. 37; Wester- marck, Moral Ideas I, 255ff (where there is a useful survey of the various interpreta- tions that have been given of the medieval animal trials).</page><page sequence="26">On Thing-Liability in Early Law 347 medieval Europe had elaborate court structures and it is both appropriate and natural for the community to utilise these as the mechanism for the disposal of an animal. I do not think von Amira's explanation of the ecclesiastical procedures is at all convincing. There does not seem to be any evidence for the notion that souls were believed to dwell in the animals or that the procedures were magical, whatever that might mean (86). The question again resolves itself into a considera- tion of the means available to a community to counter a particular type of menace. Hordes of destructive creatures could not physically be driven away or destroyed. The only force to which they might be amenable was the non-physical represented by curse and excommunica- tion. Furthermore, the solemn ecclesiastical procedures may have had a useful symbolic function in that they expressed in a striking fashion the concern and worry of the community, thus also providing important psychological relief. Some concluding and perhaps speculative points may be extracted from the discussion. Where the people involved are the owner of the animal or object which has caused harm and the victim or his kin, I have suggested that the delivery of the animal or object by the former to the latter is to be understood as a form of compensation. By this I mean that the people who participate in the delivery themselves look upon the animal or object as compensation. Part of the difficulty ex- perienced in accepting such a conclusion lies in the word com- pensation itself. It cannot express the payment of goods or money of the same economic value as the loss suffered. Nor should this seem at all surprising. Such a calculation would be impossible in the case of the death of a person and even in that of an injury inflicted on him. One cannot invoke 'loss of earnings' or 'medical expenses' as one can for economically more sophisticated societies. What one does find in early Germanic society is the placing of a fixed value (wergeld) upon a person's life and the operation-of a tariff by which certain fixed payments are due for certain types of injury. However this system was designed primarily for the case in which one person had killed or injured another. It might be applied to, or adopted in, a case where the death or injury had been caused by an animal or object owned by someone (87). But there was still the fact that it was not the owner of the animal or object who had himself killed or injured. Hence not all of the early Germanic systems applied the rules that determined what was to be paid where one human had killed or injured another. Instead, they determined the payment, at least in part, by reference to the animal or object which had caused the death or injury. (86) Cf. Westermarck, op. cit., 255 n.3. (87) Cf. lex Saxonum, 54-60; lex Frisionum, Tit. Ilia, 68-9; lex Gundobada 18.2; edictum Rothari, 138, 325-6, 387; lex Alamannoum, Pactus III, 17, 18; Lib. II, 76.2.3; Karolina , 74.1; Gulathing Law, 169, 172-5.</page><page sequence="27">348 The Irish Jurist, 1984 Against this background the reason for the surrender of the animal or object readily becomes apparent. Granted that the victim or his kin is to receive some payment and granted that a fixed wergeld or tariff system is not to be applied, the most natural and appropriate payment is supplied by the very animal or object that caused the harm. I use the phrase 'natural and appropriate' for two reasons. In the first place the victim or his kin acquires what may be regarded as a self-evident or natural claim to the tangible cause of the harm, and in the second place that cause is likely to possess an economic value in that it can be put to a productive use. Hence the victim or his kin in realising the naturally acquired claim at the same time receives a payment of value. An animal, especially an ox, bull or horse, might possess a considerable value and it is significant that in the one clear case of the surrender of an object (the tree) its utility is also obvious. What happened to an animal surrendered to the victim or his kin may well have depended upon the circumstances in which the harm had been caused. In cases of damage to property or relatively minor physical injuries to a human the animal was no doubt kept and put to its normal use. A problem would arise, however, where the animal had killed or seriously injured someone. If it was a viciously dangerous beast it prob- ably was killed, not in order to exact vengeance, but to ensure that no one else was killed. Yet even where the animal had killed a person the circumstances might show that it was not of a viciously dangerous character; an accident may have happened through the fault of the victim or in some other way which did not disclose a vicious propensity on its part. In such circumstances there appears to be no reason why the animal should not have been kept and put to its normal use. Some communities while still treating the matter as one between the owner and the victim or his kin adopted a different solution. The former incurred the obligation to surrender the animal or make other payment only if he kept and continued to feed it after it had killed or injured someone or caused damage. One might say that the primary obligation on the owner was to expel the animal from his homestead. What underlies this obligation seems to be the need to dissociate himself from the deed. In other words, it is probable that the act of the animal was treated as the act of the owner unless he took immediate and unequivocal steps to relinquish any connection with it. This notion is perfectly intelligible even if one hesitates to fasten anything so elaborate as a doctrine of causality upon the communities concerned. Where the fate of an animal or object which has caused harm, especially through the death of a person, is not left to the owner and the victim or his kin but is determined by the intervention of the community itself, or at least a larger body of persons than those immediately affected by the incident, a rather different point of view is disclosed. The object of intervention by the community is the removal of something which poses a threat to it. An animal which has once killed is an obvious</page><page sequence="28">On Thing-Liability in Early Law 349 threat in that it may kill again. However, it is not certain that the mere need to remove a physical danger is at the root of the community's intervention. There is no such threat, for example, where an inanimate object has caused someone's death. I have suggested that a more relevant factor is the instinctive aversion aroused by the instrument of an individual's death. In a small, closely knit community the death of anyone is a matter of concern to all. However, the instinct of aversion is not likely to be present, or at any rate intensely felt, in all cases. Where someone dies through old age or is killed in battle with the enemy, the death is natural and may not arouse an instinct of aversion with respect to the means. If death has resulted from an occurrence which appears to be unnatural such as an attack from an animal, accidentally falling on a weapon, or even being stabbed by a member of the same community, the instrumentality is likely to be regarded with horror and revulsion. The outcome of such a feeling is the removal of the death-dealing person, animal or object from the community. I have spoken of instinct of aversion rather than pollution because the latter term implies to me a complex set of beliefs concerning the rela- tionship or interaction between the divine and human worlds. It is quite possible that any given community will maintain a set of beliefs which either its own members or an investigator may appropriately describe in terms of pollution. But I do not think that it is permissible to invoke a doctrine of pollution every time one finds the community taking action to remove an animal or object that has killed one of its members. Such a doctrine may in fact provide an explanation, but its existence should be demonstrated independently of the data which it is invoked to explain. I do not want to maintain that there is any particular evolutionary relationship between the three core notions I have utilised: the making of compensation, the instinct of aversion and the causal connection postulated between owner and act of animal. It cannot be shown that every society has passed through stages each marked by the prevalence of one of those notions or that a hierarchy between them can be established such that in every society a stage characterised by the instinct of aversion precedes that characterised by the postulation of a causal connection or recognition of the importance of compensation. It is possible that in any given society at any given time more than one of these notions is present. Yet it is true that, on the whole, as societies become economically more complex and educationally more sophisticated, certain changes occur. The instinct of aversion, although still present, is given less practical effect, the causal connection between the owner and the act of his animal ceases to be an assumption, and more consideration is given to the question of fault on the former's part, and the economic benefit of com- pensation assumes a much greater prominence.</page></plain_text>
