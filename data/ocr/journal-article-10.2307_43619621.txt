<plain_text><page sequence="1">A holistic perspective for environmental education This article is derived from working papers of the US Office of Environmental Education. The ideas expressed do not necessarily reflect the opinions of that office. I know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not take it from them, but to inform their discretion. (Thomas Jefferson, September 28, 1820) The Congress, recognizing the profound impact of man's activity on the interrelations of all components of the natural environment, particularly the profound influences of population growth, high-density urbanization, industrial expansion, resource exploitation, and new and expanding technological advances and recognizing further the critical importance of restoring and maintaining environmental quality to the overall welfare and development of man, declares that it is the continuing policy of the Federal Government in cooperation with State and local governments, and other concerned public and private organizations, to use all practicable means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated to foster and promote the general welfare, to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans. (Sec. 101, Declaration of National Environmental Policy, National Environmental Protection Act, 1969). The Environmental Education Act in this context thus provides a necessary counterpart and instrument for achieving meaningful implementation of the national environmental policy (table 1). Its goal is to develop the basic educational resources and opportunities required for citizens to acquire the knowledge and skills which will enable them to participate in the decision-making process, whether it be at local, state, regional, national or global levels. If the hard decisions are to be made by society as a whole, then more effective communication is needed among citizens and lawmakers, professionals and laymen, and between all sectors of interest in the society. The challenge to the Office of Environmental Education is to develop resources and strategies for more effective education of the adult working and voting-age population as well as for formal training programs. The design and implementation of resources and learning activities for the adult requires the serious reexamination of the processes through which adults, as contrasted with children, learn most effectively, where the ultimate purpose of the educational experience is in large measure reeducation for survival in a world of increasingly complex demands and interdependency among factors which contribute to the quality of human life. Similarly restructuring formal educational programs also requires study of the basic principles. Ralph B. Tyler1 has examined this process of educational reform from the perspective of modern learning theory and practice and provides a rationale for an integrated, holistic approach. He poses the major questions which must be addressed by the educator, curriculum developer, teacher and the broader community, if an educational program is to be planned for some specified purpose and if efforts for continued improvement are to be made (table 2). All too often, particularly in formal education systems, basically sound contextual and substantive instructional objectives, for environmental education purposes, are merely superimposed or added on to existing curricula and operational structures, for which the objectives and strategies are usually more circumscribed, and sometimes competitive, or even contradictory. For example, many proposals will describe learning objectives which constitute understanding of the complex social, economic and environmental causes and consequences of water pollution, then proceed to outline a plan for minor modification of the biology curriculum, by a team of teachers (to be selected), representative of various disciplines, who will meet for six weeks over the summer. Beyond the idea The idea of environmental education is well known and widely supported but its implications and characteristics have been somewhat elusive and less than clearly understood. 252 E k is tics 246.

"The term environmental education' means the educational process dealing with man s relationship with his natural and man-made surroundings, and includes the relation of population, pollution, resource allocation and depletion, conservation, transportation, technology, economic impact, and urban and rural planning to the total human environment. 2. "Emphasis shall be placed on the development of skills and insights needed to understand the structure, requirements, and impact within and among various environmental entities, systems and subsystems. 3. "... financial assistance will be provided for projects invol- ving participants in inquiries into both the specific and general environmental implications of human activities and their short- and long-range effect on societal resources and general public policy." 4. "Thus the environmental education process is multifaceted. multidisciplinary. and issue- or problem-oriented. Otherwise worthwhile but specialized and narrowly defined educational approaches . . . which normally tend to exclude consideration of mutually reinforcing social, physical, cultural, and policy implication ... do not adequately meet the scope and purposes of the act. 5. "The project will help participants recognize the immediate and long-term environmental and education impact of personal and occupational decisions and policies (eg, local, national, and international implication)." 6. "... the process of environmental education helps fhe learner perceive and understand environmental principles and prob- lems . . . identify and evaluate the possible alternative solu- tions . . . and assess their benefits and risks." 7. "Each environmental education activity partakes of particular aspects of these areas [disciplines, institutions, environmental concepts and problems], fusing them in a manner that makes a great comprehension and understanding of contemporary environmental issues and problems possible by bringing about deeper awareness of relevant interrelationships 8. "Environmental education activities . . . demand as well that the tools of the various disciplines be used in a highly integrative manner." 9. "The areas [environmental inquiry] themselves are separately defined for the sake of convenience only; in reality, they are all interconnected. It is this interwoven quality and the balances and relationships among areas that environmental education deals with.'' 10. "One of the chief goals of environmental education is to help us learn how to proceed as a society toward a condition of 'productive harmony' with our environment 11. "Such a process can give us the knowledge to change course where necessary, minimize undesirable effects, and maintain a dynamic, productive, and healthy relationship with our envi- ronment." The act emphasizes the following points: • A concept of environment which includes the entire experiential milieu of man, encompassing all things, both abstract and concrete - society, institutions, the plethora of artifacts created by man through his technologies, the forms of collective experience we call cultures, ways of life, history, and the accumulated dreams and memories of people. • The interrelatedness of "systems" aspects of environment, environmental problems, and environmental impact. • The need for policies concerned with long- range or future consequences as well as immediate impacts of plans and activities on environmental quality. • The need to consider psychosocial, economic, cultural and other subject (man-centered or perceived) factors in addressing physical environment problems. • The need for informed public participation in and support of policies and programs concerned with environmental quality. • The need for new educational approaches capable of dealing with holistic problems in holistic contexts. Educators, not unlike other technical experts, must make use of the best thinking and tools of all professions, disciplines and groups in identifying Table 2 Basic principles of curriculum and instruction (after Ralph B. Tyler) 1. What educational purposes should the school seek to attain? • Studies of the learners themselves as a source of educational objectives • Studies of contemporary life outside the school • Suggestions about objectives from subject specialists • Use of philosophy in selecting objectives • Use^of a psychology of learning in selecting objectives • Stating objectives in a form to be helpful in selecting learning experiences and in guiding teaching 2. How can learning experiences be selected which are likely to be useful in attaining these objectives? • Meaning of the term "learning experience" • General principles in selecting learning experiences • Illustrations of the characteristics of learning experiences useful in attaining various types of objectives 3. How can learning experiences be organized for effective instruction: • What is meant by "organization" • Criteria for effective organization • Elements to be organized • Organizing principles • Organizing structure • Process of planning a unit of organization 4. How can the effectiveness of learning experiences be evaluated? • Need for evaluation • Basic notions regarding evaluation • Evaluation procedures • Using the results of evaluation • Other values and uses of evaluation procedures. Ekistics 246, May 1976 253</page><page sequence="3">and synthesizing what is known, and create fertile ground for the "invention" of new knowledge and experience - for innovation. The synthesis, if it is to be meaningful either intellectually or operationally, must have a context, a structure. An example of the relevance of context and structure in achieving the purposes of environmental education is the seemingly insurmountable problem encountered in attempting to approach the broader concerns of environmental education from the perspective of the "man-made" environment. While the specific problems are many and varied, a prevailing factor is the inadequate treatment (or inability to determine an appropriate treatment) of man as an integral part of, but primary concern in the study of the environmental complex. Efforts have ranged from the view of man as an element of no greater or lesser importance than trees, flowers, air, water, and so on; man as the manipulator, owner and master of his surroundings; to man as the polluter or problem in an otherwise good if not perfect place or world. In the absence of context, these and any other views are equally valid but equally useless for educational purposes. But promising approaches are evolving and being tested in a number of fields. Particularly in realms of planning and geography, conceptual structures which seem to possess the interdisciplinary utility and transferability required for environmental education have emerged. Organizing concepts In Toward a General Theory of Planning , H. Ozbekhan2 provides an overview of the epistemologica! foundations and characteristics of an approach to planning which synthesizes an anthropocentric view of world order with the holistic structure and methodology of general systems theory. Ozbekhan analyzes the failure of the technoscientific approaches, which predominate our present perception of reality and are still largely governed by the world view of nineteenth century industrialism. Ozbekhan examines the hypotheses of a new conception of world order and the relationship of man/environment which provides a possible framework for pursuit of rational action toward effecting changes in the environment which are favorable to man. Asserting that the environment, or reality for present and future mankind, is primarily of our own making, it becomes necessary, for purposes of perceiving and correcting undesirable imbalances in the dynamic interrelationship of man and environment, to conceive a purpose and structure for this interactivity which goes beyond the idea of ecology and biological processes and assigns organizing function and primacy to human potential for self-correcting action according to valued ends. Again, such an approach seems to be within reach through the principles and constructs of general systems theory. Achievement of environmental education goals occurs at the normative and purposive levels through interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary innovation.3 Typically, it focuses on large social and man/ environment systems, ekistics, and a variety of "joint systems" of society and technology. Few of the domains at this level have yet found valid frameworks - ekistics may be farthest advanced in this respect - and the current concepts of law and macro- economics hardly meet the interdisciplinary challenge posed to them in the technological era. It is at this level that the broad conceptualization of man's active role in shaping his own and the planet's future enfolds. The "organizing language" ought to be anthropology in its most profound sense, the science of how to create an anthropomorphic world and how mankind may become capable of surviving dyoamically changing environments. That most of anthropology today is not much more than an empirical behavioral science illuminates drastically the confusion created in modern sciences by the traditional cultural postulate of "knowledge per se" and the corresponding emphasis on empiricism. It appears futile to discuss what, in the education/ innovation system, should be called science and what not. In a narrow, positivistic sense, the notion of science applies only to the lowest systems level. Whether this science is organized and coordinated again by science or by categories of thought, which are given other names, is a matter of arbitrary definition. The horizontal "organizing languages" of logic, cybernetics, planning and anthropology, in order of increasing systemicity, intermesh with the vertical "organizing languages" of general systems theory (deductive) and organization theory (inductive). If the education/innovation system is viewed as a purposive system for the self-renewal of society, we should, in Ozbekhan's words, "be able to investigate in a more orderly way than has hitherto been possible, whether methodologies arising from anthropology and general systems theory - both of which deal with phenomena that pertain to whole groups - might not be forged into a methodological structure for planning." With such a structure for planning it will then be possible to link the normative, pragmatic, and empirical levels in an interdisciplinary way and ultimately aim at a genuine trans- disciplinary coordination, that is, at managing the education/innovation system in an integral way. Human settlements To be concerned with the man-made environment as defined in holistic thinking and emerging models for planning and education, means addressing squarely the problems and issues inherent in the process of urbanization or otherwise altering patterns of human settlement and social structure. Spencer Havlick, in The Urban Organism 4 - building on the holistic conceptual structure of ekistics - describes the significance and implication of regarding the large city as a "natural" resource* that in the absence of wise interdisciplinary conservation 254 Ekistics 246, May 1976</page><page sequence="4">measures is threatened with extinction - for which the consequences to society and quality of human life would be pervasive and profound. By viewing urbanization as a dynamic process through which materials, people and ideas are synthesized and transformed for man's use and service, it is seen that urban organism yields certain, presumably highly valued, utilities to man in the form of goods, services and reservoirs of information otherwise unavailable in scattered settlements. Havlick stresses the importance in this conception of "urban conservation" of regarding people and man-made systems and aspirations as an integral part of the urban organism as well as its beneficiaries. It thus becomes imperative for education in the broadest sense to equip the citizenry with the knowledge, skills and experience to participate meaningfully in decision-making influencing management of resources for man. Ever since Kuhn wrote his Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962)5 social theorists have been using the concept of alternative paradigms to juxtapose different ways of perceiving and interpreting reality. Unfortunately, no widely accepted paradigm for inquiry on human settlements development has yet emerged. Lacking any acceptable theory which is more than a convenient and simplistic integration of perspectives borrowed from sociology, political science, architecture, and other disciplines, both scholars and builders are at odds on how to interpret and appreciate the complexity of the human settlement morphology.6 In the absence of a contemporary paradigm for inquiry, they resort to a rationality dominated by economic growth, and wasteful use of human and natural resources, at the expense of humanistic goals and ideals guided by the ecological and self-realization ethics. The ability, however, of the dominant economic rationality paradigm to bring about a truly humane settlement is held increasingly in question. There appears to be a contemporary view of the societal situation, as represented for example by the Environmental Education Act discussed previously, which seems to be based on the following two interrelated assumptions: • Assumption 1 : The world is becoming rapidly more and more interdependent and intersensitive; one way of visualizing this phenomenon is through the "image of the future" represented by the Ecumenopolis of C.A. Doxiadis7 which is gradually becoming a reality. However, the convergent crises of worldwide inflation, the ideological schisms, the energy crunch, and the looming food shortages may represent insurmountable barriers to the emergence of a global symbiotic and heterogeneous human settlement. • Assumption 2: To surmount the barriers to the emergence of Ecumenopolis we need to invent new concepts, new methods, and new institutions. We need, in other words, a new policy science paradigm that will facilitate the transition from an era dominated by economic growth rationality, wasteful consumption, and meaningless affluence, to an era of anticipatory democracy, cooperation (symbiosis), and restraint. In the context of these two assumptions, the implications of the act are that citizens, decision makers, and policy makers must internalize the contemporary situation as represented by such geographic phenomena as the emergence of a number of megalopolises throughout the world. To understand, explain, and plan the quality of life within these new entities we need a contemporary methodology. Ekistics, as the new science of human settlements, represents a new paradigm. The rapid concentration of people into megalopolises has to some degree aggravated and produced many of our continuous urban problems of congestion, pollution, ill health, crime, loss of community identification, and governmental fragmentation. While we seem to be tending towards much greater levels of population agglomeration, opinion polls inform us that an absolute majority of the Western people would prefer to live at a much smaller scale of community. Thus, a major dilemma emerges: on the one hand, projections suggest continued growth of population concentrations; on the other hand, there are indications that these trends are neither preferred nor perhaps desirable for the quality of life of a substantial proportion of the people. When we ask if there is an "optimum" city size, we are really asking: what is the urban scale most conducive to the realization of some desired quality of life? Since the reality perceptions of people's desirable life styles are diverse, it follows that the policy planning process should be embedded into a nested hierarchy of human settlements (as represented graphically by the ekistic grid) that satisfies the needs and values of all people. Megalopolises offer desirable life styles - such as socioeconomic diversity, cultural options and amenities, anonymity, and opportunities for personal achievement - for many people. For others, they represent undesirable entities because they give rise to such attributes as underlying homogeneity yielding a superficial diversity, alienation of the citizenry, too much competition, and so on. Assuming that large complex population agglomerations, such as megalopolises and eventually Ecumenopolis, represent the inevitable settlements of the future (as some people, including Doxiadis, claim), the principal issue is how do we proceed to adapt our institutions and our methodologies in order to better plan the life styles of the generationslhat will be living in these large complex systems. In a recent report prepared for the National Science Foundation by the Stanford Research Institute, a number of very interesting properties for large systems have been identified by the researchers:» Ekistics 246, May 1976 255</page><page sequence="5">• Large systems may grow to a point where they yield diminishing returns to scale - particularly when considered from an overall socio- economic perspective; • Large "successful" systems, premised upon plentiful resources, can become unsuccessful when confronted with scarce resources; • As system size increases, interdependence increases and, in turn, vulnerability of the system to damaging perturbations increases; • The highly specialized work roles implied by the division of labor found in large urban systems may contribute to worker boredom, absenteeism, lowered productivity, and lower product quality; • Large systems are generally complex and that complexity, in turn, limits the rate of effective acquisition and use of knowledge. • As the effective comprehension of highly complex issues becomes more difficult for the policy maker, decision maker, and citizen, increasing reliance is placed upon specialist/ experts, that is, persons who are essential to the system but are not responsible and accountable. • For those who cannot specialize, given their mandated broad focus of concern (for instance, the mayor of a city), complexity reduces the comprehensibility of the system being governed and increases the likelihood of attempting to employ simple solutions to solve difficult problems. Given the continuously increasing complexity of human settlements, a reasonable course of action is to design and implement a learning system capable of dealing with complexity. Ekistics and environmental education Ekistics, as the science of human settlements, is dedicated to improving our ability to understand, explain, appreciate, and share our contemporary human settlement reality situation. Inbrder to achieve this objective we must begin to operationalize through legislation such as the Environmental Education Act the following two propositions: 1. Human settlements are fundamentally different entities (or systems) from the physical or mechanical systems with which traditional science and engineering have largely concerned themselves; 2. The methodology for human settlement development must differ substantially from the methodologies applicable in more conventional disciplines such as economics, architecture, and law. In fact, the methodology should transcend disciplinary boundaries and must be based on a process of public participation linked to an instrument for explicating and integrating diverse reality perceptions.9 These two propositions represent a very significant agenda for ekistics. Since the science of human settlements can embrace all the diverse episte- mologies which manifest themselves at different geographic locations of the globe, we can envision the gradual establishment around the globe of diverse cultural networks symbiotically interconnected through a common language.
