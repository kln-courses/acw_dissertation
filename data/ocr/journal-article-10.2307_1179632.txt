<plain_text><page sequence="1">Beyond Criticism: The Authority of the School Text CARMEN LUKE, SUZANNE DE CASTELL, and ALLAN LUKE Simon Fraser University Any general statement is like a cheque drawn from a bank. Its value depends on what is there to meet it. Ezra Pound (1934) Orientation: Olson on Texts and Schooling Research and literature on the nature and function of the school text, predominantly the concern of curriculum developers and educational psychologists, has been narrowly focused on the efficient delivery of reading skills and disciplinary knowledge. During the 1970s, David R. Olson began to formulate an interdisciplinary research orientation on the educational nature and function of textual knowledge (Bruner and Olson, 1977; Olson, 1977a). In On the Language and Authority of Textbooks (1980), Olson develops his general discussion of the cognitive and cultural "bias" of print to explain the force and meaning of a specific genre of text, the school textbook. Our purpose in this article is to critically explore Olson's view of the school text, focusing on the distinctive communicational constraints of both the school text and the classroom context. To this end we will examine the textbook's mode of discourse, the techniques of text construction, its material quality, and the institutional practices which circumscribe it. We take note of Michel Foucault's explanation (1972), which we share, that "the statement," textual or spoken, embodies an authority and meaning only insofar as it exists in a "discursive field"- a field of use and exchange. To say that statements are residual ... is not to say that they remain in the field of memory, or that it is possible to rediscover what they meant; but it means that they are preserved by virtue of a number of supports and material techniques (of which the book is, of course, only one example), in accordance with certain types of institutions (which are not the same in the case of a religious ? 1983 by the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education.

This also means that they are invested in techniques that put them into operation, in practices that derive from them, in the social relations that they form, or, through those relations, modify. [our italics; Foucault, 1972, p. 123] Since the advent of typography and the subsequent rise of mass schooling, society's valid statements have been encoded in and transmitted through books (Eisenstein, 1979; Innis, 1951; Ivins, 1953). When we refer to "curricular knowledge," that which is intentionally transmitted in the classroom, we are generally referring to knowledge within the school textbook. Despite historically differing educational aims and in- structional approaches, the school text continues to embody the "au- thorized version of society's valid knowledge" (Olson, 1980, p. 192). In accordance with changing epistemology, ideology, and disciplinary knowledge, textbooks are the products of changing techniques which lead to periodic revision, reediting, obsolescence, and replacement of texts. Yet the text qua text has remained constant-a fixed locus within the schooling system from which the means and ends of instruction are derived. It is claimed that the reason for the enduring centrality of texts to education resides in the distinctive intellectual processing required to extract information from textual language, information which can be preserved because of the permanence of print. Olson draws attention to similarities between ritualized speech in traditional oral societies, and written texts in literate societies, showing that both are ways of "putting ideas and beliefs above criticism," and that both "serve an important archival function in preserving what the society takes to be 'true' and 'valid' knowledge ... from which rules of thought and action may be derived." (p. 191) Olson argues that "any archival form, being traditionally or historically grounded, calls for comprehension and production strat- egies somewhat different from those employed in everyday speech, skills that may require sustained 'education' for their acquisition" (p. 195). Access to textual knowledge requires an educated sensitivity to the dif- ferences between "what is said," literally, as in print, and "what is meant," figuratively, as in speech (p. 191). The significant role of textbooks in education, then, is a function of their ability to "make meanings more explicit" in a manner which places those meanings "above criticism." Olson explains that Although never completely successful, these texts are an attempt to construct statements in which the literal meaning is an adequate reflection of the speaker's intentions, and which, as a result, preserve their meanings across speakers and situations. [1980, p. 190] Since education aims to transmit to each new generation "culturally sig- nificant knowledge," then, textbooks are an ideal format. Olson suggests this is so for reasons intrinsic to texts: "their linguistic forms per se" (p. 190). The distinctive language of textbooks involves, according to Olson, "an emphasis on definitions of terms ... on meanings formalized 112</page><page sequence="3">AUTHORITY OF THE SCHOOL TEXT through a specification of criterial features and strict word boundaries." Secondly, he notes "an emphasis on complete and unmarked grammatical forms, typically well-formed declarative sentences," and thirdly, an em- phasis on "explicit logical structure relating clauses and sentences" (p. 190). These structural elements enable textbooks to model "the bias of writing towards explicit, autonomous meanings." Because texts are explicit, and because they preserve "the very words," they maintain historically grounded culturally significant information in a durable and objectified form across time and space (Innis, 1951). In this sense, then, the information to be acquired is "in the text" (Olson, 1980, p. 192). Olson then specifies the "social relations expressed and maintained by written text" as "authorized" valid knowledge which the student must master. Having already shown how the language of texts is different from the oral language of the child, so that a new and difficult set of cognitive and linguistic skills must be mastered before the student can criticize the text, Olson draws attention to the disjunction between the reader and the text author as an additional source of authority. Written texts separate the speech from the speaker, and thereby give texts a kind of "transcendental" status (p. 192). Olson explains, "Recall that as long as the speech originates with the current speaker, his listeners know that it is just his assertion, and that as a result it is apt to reflect his knowledge, his interests. ... Hence his utterances are open to criticism" (p. 192). Intrinsic to textual language, then, is what Olson views as "a device for managing authority." The separation of the speech from the speaker/ author, which is an intrinsic feature of the written text, tends to make the words "impersonal, objective, and above criticism." The centrality of textbooks to schooling, then, derives from the authority of texts, and, for Olson, text authority has two main sources. First, par- ticular linguistic structures make texts explicit, albeit inaccessible, until those structures have been mastered by the student. Second, texts appear "above criticism" because of the separation of the speaker from the speech, and the corresponding dissociation of the speaker from the reader, so providing an impression of textual objectivity and neutral validity. Olson's is a valuable contribution to understanding the discursive power of the school text; indeed, he draws our attention to the need for in- terdisciplinary perspectives on curricular texts not addressed by Tylerian pre- and posttest evaluation. However, his primarily linguistic analysis of school texts needs to be supplemented by a description of the social situations specific to schooling. Hence we may see how textual form and institutional context together constitute text authority. To this end, a critical stance will be taken towards each of Olson's major claims as a preliminary to elaborating those social relations which, we argue, more fully account for text authority. First, then, we ask whether it is indeed the case that texts are (ideally) explicit, and that knowledge is (ideally) "in the text." And second, we question whether it is primarily from the separation of the speaker/author and the speech/text that school texts derive their authority. 113</page><page sequence="4">LUKE, DE CASTELL, AND LUKE/CI Is the Meaning in the Text? The syntactic and discursive form, and the lexical content of school texts do indeed frame school knowledge in a form associated with neutral objectivity. The pedagogical danger of the scientific "framing" of edu- cational knowledge is that it will undermine, rather than enhance, the student reader's capacity to criticize; that, once in the classroom, textual authority will become textual authoritarianism precluding criticism. Au- thors of disciplinary texts (e.g., math and science books) strive for clarity of meaning, for explicit and unambiguous presentation of factual data; authors of basal readers strive for unambiguous narratives and tightly controlled syntactic and semantic structures, less likely to be misunderstood by readers and, as Olson notes, to "delimit possible interpretations." Olson sees the school text as an extension of the tradition of the em- pirical scientific essay. Royal Society prose style, epitomized in the phil- osophic treatises of Locke and Hume, set as its goal a "return back to the primitive purity and shortness, when man delivered so many things, almost in an equal number of words" (Sprat, 1667/1966, 391-392). Fou- cault (1977) offers a description of this movement: In the 17th and 18th centuries, a totally new conception was developed when scientific texts were accepted on their own merits and positioned within an autonomous and coherent conceptual system of established truths and methods of verification. Authentification no longer required reference to the individual who had produced them; the role of the author disappeared as an index of truthfulness. [1977, p. 126] How successful was this scientific tradition in influencing English prose style? The authors of 17th and 18th century scientific essays aspired to a completeness within the text itself, such that all salient information, all relevant premises, as well as the logical structure by which they were interrelated, were so clearly explicit that no outside, extra textual reference was required for full comprehension of the text. But whatever the as- pirations and pretensions of empirical philosophers and scientists, his- torical reflection and conceptual analysis tell us that the ideal of a self- contained, totally explicit text is naive and impossible. Arguing for this neutral, logically explicit character of modern text- books, Olson notes that the prose style of Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689/1969) "well represents the intellectual bias that orig- inated at that time and to a large extent characterizes our present use of language" (Olson, 1977a, p. 268). Yet several historians (Willey, 1937; Purvner, 1967) have argued that this tradition had less impact on the form of modern prose than commonly thought. In The Royal Society: Concept and Creation (1967), Purvner notes that Though the English language may have derived something more from this idiom of science than Sprat predicted, it is not from this source that modern English has taken its character, The prose form which did emerge triumphantly during the second half of the seventeenth century, the style of which Dryden was the great exponent, was not characterized by scientific starkness. Its out- standing quality was not plainness but flexibility. [1967, p. 99] 114</page><page sequence="5">AUTHORITY OF THE SCHOOL TEXT Thus, 17th century scientific prose spawned a parallel tradition of allusive and satirical prose, exemplified in the essays and broadsides of Swift, Addison and Steele, and Johnson, arguably as rich and historically sig- nificant (Kenner, 1962). To claim that the school text, either disciplinary or literary, is a descendent of Royal Society style is to ignore the continuing place of nonscientific literary prose in the education of children. Most intermediate and secondary language arts texts, for instance, still attempt to capture a richness, flexibility and allusiveness of textual language, as reflected in the selection of a wide range of literary and journalistic prose styles. It is possible as well to critique the notion of a totally explicit and logically entailed text on conceptual grounds. Every disciplinary text necessarily presupposes reference to the discipline which makes up its historical and contemporary context. In the absence of such context, the text itself cannot possibly "say what it means." The premises of an argument may be clearly stated, yet what counts as a relevant premise varies from one discipline to the next. We rely on background disciplinary knowledge in order to know why this premise counts as a premise in every generic case. The logical structure of an argument may be explicitly stated, yet what counts as an argument varies across disciplines-similarly with concepts and their interrelations, discipline-specific lexical usage, and so on. In most cases, we do not fully understand any particular text until we have some concept of the discipline into which it fits, and in which it has its sense and significance. Conversely, we do not understand the discipline ade- quately until we are familiar with the historical works which make it up. In the case of the educational text, students are reliant on previous courses, readings, and teacher explanation: the cumulative background knowledge which makes pursuit of the text's propositional and linguistic features possible in the first place. Similarly, many literary critics express an increasing skepticism of the possibility of determining a fixed and correct meaning based on the formal "intrinsic" properties of the text. Fish (1980), for instance, argues that the reader's experience of the text is contingent on strategies learned from an "interpretive community." The claim here is that no text is un- situated: that the text is "rewritten" with each reading. This reader-driven theory of the acquisition of textual knowledge is perhaps extreme, im- plying as it does that interpretations and interpretive communities wholly determine the meaning of the written text. However, developments in speech act (Fish, 1980; Searle, 1975), rhetorical (Burke, 1957), and semiotic (Scholes, 1977) theories of literature compel a reconsideration of the belief shared by advocates of scientific prose and the New Criticism alike: that the meaning is in the text, and can be determined solely by reference to the text. Thus, post-New Criticism literary theory draws our attention to the background knowledge of the reader and the social situation of the act of reading as determinants of meaning, interpretation, and criticism. These observations regarding the historical evolution of modern prose, the disciplinary background knowledge of the reader, and the situation 115</page><page sequence="6">LUKE, DE CASTELL, AND LUKE/CI or context of interpretation all indicate that knowledge is not, nor could it be, "in the text" solus. Arguing against the concept of self-contained and self-justifying curricular knowledge, Esland (1971) notes that "the problems which are thought to reside in a body of knowledge ... are themselves socially constructed" (our italics, 1971, p. 77). Moreover, the claim to "autonomous" explicitness is ideological in its attempt to render controversial epistemic assumptions about the institutional selection, framing, distribution and control of curricular knowledge as taken for granted (Young, 1971; Apple, 1971; Taxel, 1981). With this in mind, we must look critically at Olson's concept of the nature of school texts. Unlike literary works and disciplinary text, text- books have a technical structure which punctuates the text, and thereby constrains what can count as authorized textual content. As a result, "what is true in a school book may not be true", for example, "in a work of historical research" (Austin, 1962, p. 143). Today, as in the recent past, the techniques of curriculum development are evaluation driven, so that what counts as curricular knowledge is largely a function of how and by what criteria the acquisition of text knowledge is evaluated (Hamilton, 1978). To facilitate instruction and assessment, it is common for school textbooks, and this includes literary works, to frame ideational and skill components into sections that are familiar to us all. Recall, for instance, finding at the end of chapters pages entitled "concepts and ideas," "im- portant words," "things to do," "fact quizzes," chapter summaries, and, most commonly, "comprehension questions" which guide and delimit our experience of the text. This editorial compartmentalization, aided by graphics and layout formats, reflects a very different discourse structure than that described in Olson's analysis. The intentional sectioning and punctuating of information reinforces the apparently "neutral" character of the information, and serves distinct instructional ends. But it is not at all the same information as it would be, were it in a linguistic form which derived its authority from the words themselves rather than the various "markers" inserted by authors and editors for instructional pur- poses. That is to say, it is this controlled and coded structure of school texts which constrains what is to count as "being in the text." Very different information is rendered explicit, with the textbook's editorial and graphic format modifying as it does the reader's response to the prose itself. How then can we say, as a generalization, that, like other texts, school texts preserve "the very words" of the author/speaker "across generations and cultures?" The notion of the school text as an idealized (explicit) prose does not account for the discourse structure of many basal readers and prescribed course books currently in use. Similarly, Olson's analysis requires a further specification of the crucial difference between the "text per se" and the text in use: more specifically, the text in use in the rule-bound classroom. For the student reader is constrained by a variety of contextual factors extrinsic to the text, but intrinsic to the social structure of schools. These are very different from the contextual constraints on the reader of popular novels, the literary critic, and the scientist. 116</page><page sequence="7">AUTHORITY OF THE SCHOOL TEXT The Text in Use Undoubtedly, the school text must be examined for its intrinsic linguistic features. Techniques for assessing readability, lexical cohesion, propo- sitional coherence, and story grammars are necessary hermeneutics to determine the relative accessibility of textual knowledge. However, if we are concerned with the actual sources of text authority, we must consider the extratextual and interactional practices which mediate its educational use. In The Pragmatics of Human Communication (1967), Watzlawick, Beavin, and Jackson point out the dangers in methodological isolation of an object from its context. A phenomenon remains inexplicable so long as the range of observation is not wide enough to include the context in which the phenomenon occurs. Failure to realize the intricacies of the relationships between an event and the matrix in which it takes place . . . either confronts the observer with something "mys- terious" or induces him to attribute to his object of study certain properties which the object may not possess. [our italics, 1967, p. 21] There is little "mystery" about what happens to the text once in class- room use. The student's apprehension of textual content and form is controlled by curricular, instructional, and administrative guidelines and objectives which have at least as much to do with institutional consid- erations as cultural and linguistic ones. How and what the student learns from the text is highly dependent on the specific manner in which the text is taught; instructional practices delimit the pragmatic context within which the text is read and interpreted. Teaching of the text has taken very different forms in different ed- ucational epochs. For instance, in late 19th and early 20th century Classicist and 3R's instruction, school texts were primarily literary works and it was assumed that learning the text was best assured through rote mem- orization and oral recitation of the printed word. Educational progres- sivism deemphasized text-centered learning and called for silent reading and "learning by doing" instruction; texts featured "interesting" stories about local situations. The text was not abandoned, but was to be inter- preted and "experienced" through interactive projects and discussions (de Castell and Luke, 1982). Hence much of what would yet be seen as textbook knowledge was acquired in largely oral dialogical settings, rather than through a monological confrontation with the text, as under Classicist methods. Today's paradigm text is the programmed instructional manual; students learn "skills" rather than organic bodies of literature and dis- ciplinary knowledge. The text is taught through the guise of multimedia approaches; lesson packages channel learning of the printed word through games, films, skill level workbooks, and prepared activity worksheets (Lorimer, 1981). This remains, indeed, teaching the text-yet the media of instruction are now so diverse that, in effect, different sets of discourse structures, both within and outside of the text, are conveyed to students. Teaching of the text, moreover, takes various forms within the same historical period. Anyon's (1981) comparison of the curriculum and the "curriculum in use" indicates that the same text may yield different 117</page><page sequence="8">LUKE, DE CASTELL, AND LUKE/CI meanings and themes according to variations in social context. As a result, "students of different social class backgrounds are likely to be exposed to qualitatively different types of educational knowledge" (p. 3). By contrast, Olson's analysis is framed in terms of the student reader's unmediated confrontation with the text. We need to recognize, however, that the student's relationship with the text is by no means personal and unmediated. Historically, teaching of the text has always been the teacher's primary function. This presumes that the text necessitates skilled inter- pretation, so that a mediator is required between textual knowledge and the preliterate, unschooled student. This mediated relationship is anal- ogous to that of the lay and deity in the Middle Ages, which required authoritative scriptural exegesis (Eisenstein, 1979; Graff, 1982). The Medieval Great Chain of Being involved a hierarchical structure of me- diation between the biblical text and the common person, and called upon the talents of elite literati (Chaytor, 1966). Similarly, teachers are the modern day arbiters of textual knowledge. They are the elders, the "clerics" who initiate children not only into the prescribed knowledge of an era, but also into the literate processes requisite to the acquisition and application of that knowledge. Moreover, it is from teachers that students acquire not only a corpus of knowledge and skills, but also an attitude towards learning-in literary terms, a "sensibility" towards the text. In this respect, the teacher is like the literary critic, an arbiter of questions of style, aesthetic taste, propositional validity, and rhetorical force, who provides student readers with a running metatextual commentary with which to process the text. Thus, the school text is always the object of teacher mediation. One instructs with and through the text; a student confronts textual knowledge via teacher mediation. In the classroom situation, the text is the locus of information exchange. Inasmuch as the text for a particular subject, theme, or topic constrains the content of classroom information exchange, so does the teacher mediate the exchange between student and text. And within this communicational system of the classroom-a system supporting a particular structure of information exchange-the student assumes an acquiescent, nonauthoritative status in relation to both text and teacher. Conventional classroom discourse is about the text, based on the text, or directed by it. Teachers introduce the text: explaining, discussing, and assessing comprehension of both form and content. Although more commonly, instructional methods and objectives are externally directed by teacher's guides and curricular guidelines, teachers individually in- terpret both mode of instruction and textual knowledge. Probably much to the dismay of curriculum developers who seek to "teacherproof" in- structional systems, when teachers read to children they cannot help but intonate, pause, and discuss in an individually selective manner. As Elbaz (1981) has noted, teachers are not "passive transmitters of knowledge". Tacitly and intentionally, teachers will emphasize and deemphasize, select and exclude. This teacher interpretation of what is to be learned from the text helps define for the student what must be acquired as text knowledge. Partly, this is because students soon learn that what a teacher 118</page><page sequence="9">AUTHORITY OF THE SCHOOL TEXT selects and emphasizes in a text will most likely be tested. Tests, exam- inations, and daily reinforcement of "correct" student response, reflect a particular "reading" of the text-a distinct and often idiosyncratic interpretation of what is important and valuable within it. In this context of use, then, the text is necessarily reconstituted in an operational sense by a prior pedagogical reading, which may or may not "preserve the very words" of the authored text. Author, Authority, and Authorization Ideally, textual discourse, print, is more open to criticism than speech, utterance (Goody, 1977; Olson, 1977a). The permanence of written lan- guage allows it to be reread and more closely scrutinized than language used in speech. Textual information can be assimilated and compared within and between texts; the permanent character of writing enables the reader to critically comment upon the text. In dialogue, however, the hearer cannot catalogue in memory with any reliable precision the linear sequencing of data, the logical argumentation of the speaker. Hence, it is more difficult to detect inconsistencies or contradictions in speech. Goody, Olson, and McLuhan (1962) furthermore argue that exposure to textual media biases the reader's cognitive processing in favor of the linear representation of logical, analytical thought. It would appear, then, that the school text should lend itself to critical analysis and skepticism on the part of student readers, particularly in the absence of direct speaker/ author immediacy. In most school situations, however, neither text nor teacher utterance is criticized forcefully, much less critically analyzed. We may explain the latter phenomenon by reference to the institutional authority relations which place the student in subordinate status to the teacher. And in part, we may accept Olson's explanation that the views teachers express may be seen, not as their own (and hence open to crit- icism) but as those of the text-the text transformed into utterance. How may we explain this failure to criticize the text, particularly in light of the arguments supporting the inherently criticizable character of textual knowledge? Olson draws our attention to the "more highly educated or especially the members of a professional group or academic peer group" (p. 193) who, of course, typically criticize texts. But, he explains, To ask a question, to make an assertion, to issue a command, or to make a pronouncement, you must have the right within some relevant social group. The same is true, we suggest, for the right to criticism and dissent ... [1980, p. 193] Students are not within the appropriate and sanctioned social group, then, to be entitled to criticize the school text. In classroom discourse, students' claims to an equally authoritative "reading" of the text as that of the teacher lack legitimate status, becoming "misinvocations" (Austin, 1962): speech acts undermined by the speakers' lack of legal status. So 119</page><page sequence="10">LUKE, DE CASTELL, AND LUKE/CI it would seem that what situates texts "above criticism" has less to do with authorial absence. The explanation lies, rather, in the social relations governing the production and use of texts. Olson explains that "students and audiences, and especially .. . teachers . . . because their words are neither their own nor originate with a known member of their peer group, lack the right to criticism" (p. 194). The conditions of exclusion from "rightful" criticism imply a correlative condition of inclusion, granting the "right" to criticize the school text. Olson writes: Once admitted to a peer group, the written work of peers is again taken as an expression of the views of the individual who wrote them; the author and the text are reunited, so to speak. And anything that could now be said directly to the author as an equal (and perhaps even more) can now be said/written against his text. That is, a peer group both invites the possibility of criticism and reunites the author with his writing. Membership in that peer group comes at least in part from being a participant in that particular form of discourse, that is, through becoming a writer. [1980 p. 194] This condition of inclusion in the "peer group" whose right it is to criticize the text is, however, a limited explanation of the criticism of the school text, because it idealizes the relation of author, text, and reader which occurs in the context of the school. Author, text, and reader stand in different relation where texts derive their authority from being "au- thorized" rather than "authored." Let us examine this claim further. Olson parallels the relationship of speaker/utterance/hearer with that of author/text/reader. Within this schema, to accept or criticize the utterance, the hearer consults or questions the speaker. To accept or criticize the text, on the other hand, the reader consults or questions the author necessarily on the basis of the authored text. Both situations presuppose that the authority to adjudicate questions of meaning rests with the originator of the text or utterance. Utterance gives us access to the speaker as, in the sense explained by Olson, "one among equals." We have "rightful" access to the author if, according to Olson, we have gained admission to the relevant interpretive community, part of that condition involving the ability to write a (critical) text of the relevant quality and kind. However, what counts as the relevant kind or level of critical "rewriting" in the case of school textbooks is different from that of other generic types of texts. With the separation of reading and writing as distinct areas of classroom instruction, admission to a peer group (i.e., grade level, reading group, or stream) is more often granted on the basis of an achievement test score than the student's capacity to write "against the text." Furthermore, the authority of the textbook comes, not in virtue of its authorial origin, but in virtue of its having been au- thorized by an administrative source, whose authority in turn is institu- tionally bound and not solely based on authorial peer group membership. The school text, unlike most other print information, such as scholarly journals, mass paperbacks, magazines and newspapers, is unique in its culturally stipulated role of authority. The legal enforcement and sanction of public schooling ensures not only a universal right to education, but 120</page><page sequence="11">AUTHORITY OF THE SCHOOL TEXT also enforces participation. Thus, the textbook has a legally assured captive audience. Government prescribed and authorized texts constitute a common, almost universally shared experiential and linguistic basis upon which each generation's fundamental literacy and knowledge are based. Indeed, while a given textbook may not be as widely circulated as, say, Time or Reading Research Quarterly, it is universally (i.e., regionally) taught and experienced. Almost all children who attended North American schools between 1950 and 1960, for example, read about Dick and Jane, Spot and Puff. In contrast, the adult's out of school acquisition of knowl- edge from print is an individually selective process which is not guided by the institutional rules and teacher interpretation which mediate knowledge acquired from prescribed print in schools. Foucault argues that even the same text, or statement, is transformed when used in a particular institutional context: Similarly, between the text of a Constitution, or a will, or a religious revelation, and all the manuscripts or printed copies that reproduce them exactly, with the same writing, in the same characters, and on similar substances, one cannot say that there is an equivalence: on the one hand there are the statements themselves, and on the other their reproduction ... (their) identity varies with a complex set of material institutions ... [1971, p. 103] If the identity of a textual statement, its meaning and authority, is de- pendent upon an epistemic "ground" and institutional support, then the conditions for criticism are likewise derivative. As Anyon's (1981) study shows, class-differentiated treatments of the text result in extreme vari- ations in students' conceptions of the nature, validity, and criticizability of "school knowledge." Through what literate and epistemic achievement, then, could the "right" to criticize, or to gain entry into the "peer group" be had? In fact, neither literate ability nor scholarly achievement could be sufficient conditions for this right. The "authorization" which is the actual ground of the authority of the school text is completely contingent in relation to those conditions identified by Olson's analysis. That is to say, the con- ditions specified by Olson as reasons for the text being "above criticism" do not fully explain or justify that status; they function instead to legitimate as "above criticism" institutional mechanisms which are in fact beyond criticism. The Textbook as Icon In his explication of "the social relations expressed and maintained by written texts" (p. 192), Olson suggests that "... it may be because children assume that textbooks have greater authority that they are willing to devote serious and prolonged study to books, rather than simply reading them" (p. 193). He is referring to the communicational devices, structurally inherent in written language, which "may make the words impersonal, objective and above criticism"-specifically, the separation of speech from 121</page><page sequence="12">LUKE, DE CASTELL, AND LUKE/CI the speaker. Olson additionally notes that "it is the role of books in our culture that makes them an ultimate authority in matters of dispute." Why should we presuppose that "children assume that textbooks have greater authority" (our italics), when we know with certainty that this is what children are taught to believe? Olson's claim for the authority of texts is largely based on differences between oral and written codes such that the absence of the speaker renders the text immune from criticism. But as he points out, the institutional authority relation between student and teacher parallels the status difference between reader and writer. And why should we suppose that the student's belief in the authority of texts derives from the intrinsic structural features of written language or from cultural tradition, rather than from the nature of school authority relations? The point is, of course, that we cannot explain text authority exclusive from school authorization. Our inquiry on textbooks must be, to cite Watzlawick et al. (1967) again, "extended to include the effects ... on others, their reactions to it, and the context in which this all takes place" (p. 21). We must extend our focus from "the artificially isolated monad to the relationship between the parts of a wider system." Surely, it is within the context of the classroom that a systemic, rather than a structural analysis of the authority must be sought. By taking the classroom situation into account, then that context can be specified more concretely than a broad reference to "the culture" will allow. Since teacher, text, and student are hierarchically situated in the authority network of the school, it is by reference to this system that we can specify how teachers "manage" texts and sustain their own status as beyond criticism. First of all, we must not overlook the function of the text as a material artifact. If we consider the text exclusively as a linguistic form, we may fail to see the ways in which the text has status as an icon, as a material artifact. Literary critic Christopher Caudwell (1936/1971) argued that the separation of the text from its social context had led to a critical neglect of the text's actual existence as a material object. As such, the text must be seen as the object of social and economic regulation: from the composing and editorial process to actual mass dissemination and use. The text has a physical presence. As a piece of school and therefore public property, and as a medium of instruction and interaction, the text must be examined within the institutional context. If we observe children in school working with textbooks, it becomes obvious that much of their response is to text qua social object: a thing to be ritually cared for and venerated, but also scribbled in, slammed against lockers, and hidden from teachers and other students. Teachers often use the text as an exemplary lesson in the value of private and government property. The status of the text, then, is self-serving. The teacher in a sense uses the text to objectify institutional rules, from which his/her authority, not incidentally, is also derived. In schools, students quickly learn what can and cannot be done to the text as part of the rite of "learning the role of the student" (Apple, 1979, p. 51). School books are school property. Respect for adults, including teachers, and respect for public property are fundamental attitudinal and behavioral requisites 122</page><page sequence="13">AUTHORITY OF THE SCHOOL TEXT for appropriate conduct within the school. The teacher often makes the link between school property and private ownership explicit, admonishing students that "your parents' tax dollars pay for these books!" Marking school books is penalized, or at least reprimanded. Covering school books with protective, often commercially supplied jackets is an annual ritual, a performance praised as showing proper "respect" for the text. When a text is lost, damaged, or "defaced"-the term itself a tacit recognition of the anthropomorphic status of the text-the students must either reimburse the school or their report cards may be withheld. Students do not receive a grade, confirmation that they have acquired text knowl- edge, until "penance" has been done for disrespecting the text. The material value of the text, then, in conjunction with its unrivaled status as legitimate school knowledge, is greatly facilitated and reinforced by the institutional rules designed to protect and enhance the authority of the text. Student-written commentary about the institution and teachers is invariably found in the graffiti which defaces books-from the casual moustache on an eminent figure, to direct anti-institutional invective. In this manner, the text is a material component of schooling more open to learner criticism than the rule embodying teacher whom the student must confront in classroom dialogue. "Doing violence to the text" can be a uniquely personal and private act of criticism between the student and teacher, one for which the student will not be held responsible until textbook collection day. For oral defiance, however, the student is held immediately responsible. Thus the text stands as an iconic marker of authority, both a symbol and agent of institutional power, and so becomes a "transferred" object of student resistance to institutional constraints. And it is the teacher who embodies explicit and overt authority over the text. Teacher and Text Identity In classical education, this would have meant the teacher's epistemic au- thority with respect to the text, his/her superior knowledge of text content and form. As textbooks come to be more and more often 'purpose built' by psychologists, curriculum developers, and other professional "experts," it is increasingly less a matter of epistemic authority (on the text) and more a matter of "dejure" authority (over the text). Teachers, by virtue of the institutionally defined authority of their role, still control the text. At the start of the school year, teachers preside over the rituals of text distribution. Students have little or no say in the selection of texts. Despite regional variation in text selection procedures, in the estimation of many students, it is the teacher, not the district or regional department, who decides what books shall be used. Students are aware that different kinds of students are allocated different kinds of texts, yet this "differential distribution of classroom knowledge," documented by Apple (1979, p. 50) and Keddie (1971), is almost always the decision of the teacher. Teachers, furthermore, indicate which books may be taken home, when, 123</page><page sequence="14">LUKE, DE CASTELL, AND LUKE/CI and in what order. At the end of the school year, when the text content has supposedly been mastered, the text is withdrawn. The teacher collects the text, and students literally lose their relationship with it, to be faced once more with a new set of texts, a new set of boundaries which reestablish relations of teacher/text authority and student subordination. But how is this primacy of teacher over text authority achieved in the classroom? The school text, being of apparently "transcendental" quality, has no fixed point of view, which of course contributes to its alleged neutrality and objective authority. Nonetheless, texts embody an implicit ideological point of view which, even if evident to some teachers, is not apparent to learners. The absence of authorial "signature" (Barthes, 1977), the lack of an explicitly personal world view, coupled with the afore- mentioned system of rules in support of its validity and authority, render the text beyond criticism. Since information extracted from the text is not associated with an identifiable speaker/author intent, but rather is more readily associated with a teacher's explanations, claims, or opinions about the text, the teacher becomes for the student a surrogate author. The teacher speaks on behalf of the text and interprets the world view expressed in the text, much as the cleric spoke for God, and the oral poet spoke for tradition and cultural norms. Unlike other texts, students identify textbooks with courses and teachers. Text authors are often anonymous or corporate "absentee" authors. Teachers unwittingly reinforce this by referring to Ginn 720, "the Gage text," or "the socials book," rather than to their actual authors. Thus, for students, authorship is more often irrelevant than a distinctive source of textual authority, and that irrelevance gives rise to yet another level of institutional misnomers which detach the text even further from the author (e.g., "the blue reader", "your skilpak"). The school text is thus more closely associated with a corpus of 'indisputable' disciplinary or lesson content, than with a potentially fallible author. And it is even more tightly associated with the teacher in charge of that subject matter. For it is the teacher/mediator who explains text ma- terial, who directs dialogue about a text, who indicates closure of a lesson, and who, in this sense, embodies and reconstitutes the text in use. Finally, it is the teacher who tests student performance in modes of textual ex- egesis, be they decoding, recall, comprehension, or formal criticism. Thus teachers are in fact, and by status, in command of textual knowledge. As such, text and teacher can be seen to co-constitute a domain of knowl- edge, and to co-constitute one authoritative identity. The Curriculum is Not in the Text It is our contention that the effectiveness of the textbook is, above all, dependent on its status as part of a comprehensive and rule-bound in- stitutional order. The student responds to the text as but another element of the larger institution as much as she/he responds to the actual language and content of the textbook per se. Over the last decade, reading re- 124</page><page sequence="15">AUTHORITY OF THE SCHOOL TEXT searchers have maintained that the student's responses to the text are conditioned by prior knowledge, coded into ideational schemata (An- derson, Spiro, and Anderson, 1977). One implication of schema theories is that the student's cultural and class background, as well as common sense knowledge based outside of the school (Olson, 1977b), affect his/ her ability to apprehend and assimilate textual knowledge. Consistently overlooked, however, is the student's schematic knowledge of the school, classroom, and teacher, which conditions reactions to all aspects of the schooling process, a principal one of which is the school text. It seems clear, however, that in order to take into account "the context in which the phenomenon occurs," we must also focus on both the de jure (legitimated) and defacto (actual) status of teacher and textbook in the classroom. The power of the "word" of the textbook is premised on the social rules governing the environment of the reader, as much as on the intrinsic structural and linguistic features of the text. We have argued for a more interactive and pragmatic explanation of text apprehension, whereby meaning is contingent on the interaction between the reader's prior knowledge, the institutional setting within which the reading task is situated, the teacher who teaches the text, and the distinctive features of the textbook per se. This relationship, we have noted, is delimited and constrained by the rules of schooling which position teacher, text, and student in hierarchical levels of power and authority. We began this article with an explication of Olson's claims regarding the authority of the textbook. We found that Olson's analysis of text authority as residing primarily in the intrinsic linguistic features of a text does not fully account for the authority of textbooks in schools. None- theless, Olson's contribution makes an expanded dialogue possible, one which addresses questions of curricular authority and power from semiotic (Foucault, 1972, 1977, 1980; Barthes, 1977) and communicational (Watzlawick et al., 1967; Wilden, 1980, 1982) perspectives not widely acknowledged by curriculum developers and implementers. Our intent has been to draw attention to Olson's work, and extend it by examining the role of the textbook in the context of school praxis. The school textbook is currently the object of exhaustive research, development, marketing, and implementation. Curriculum designers and reading psychologists are continually altering, adjusting, and redesigning texts in search of more effective ways of conveying textual knowledge. In light of this relatively recent enthusiasm, it is instructive to recognize that the curriculum-its form and content, its validity and authority- is not "in the text."' NOTES 1. The authors would like to thank David Olson for his critical remarks on earlier versions of this article. He has commented that the "institution is mirrored in the text" and has suggested that we should conclude with: "the curriculum ... is mirrored in the text." This would, however, contradict the basic thesis of this article, that the context of the curriculum in use reconstitutes the text, trans- forming it into other than its literal form. 125</page><page sequence="16">LUKE, DE CASTELL, AND LUKE/CI REFERENCES ANDERSON, R.
