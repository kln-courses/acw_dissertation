My design relied on some of the hall- marks of traditional Igbo uli body drawing and wall painting, namely, the simplification of forms (mostly abstract and cur- vilinear) and the balancing of marks with large open spaces.1 On seeing the work, a visiting British professor of music had the immediate response, "Reminds me of Joan Miró." Of course, he did not know about uli , nor about the project spearheaded by Uche Okeke at Nsukka to study indigenous art traditions as a necessary step for Nigerian contemporary artists in their inevitable interactions with other traditions. Now, contrast that incident with another that took place about a decade later at the University of Ibadan. The mother of Nigerian poet Niyi Osundare walked into his office and stopped abruptly. She stood there and gazed steadily at a reproduction of my ink drawing The Road to Abuja hanging on the wall. Then, simultaneously tracing lines in the air with her finger and looking at the picture, she asked her son in Yoruba, "Isn't that the type of marking we did in the village?" My journey has been one of seeking the right idiom to convey more satisfactorily my creative impulses. In the cata- log of my 1988 exhibition at the National Gallery of Zimba- bwe, Harare, I noted, "The aesthetic strategies of Igbo uli and the linear symbolism of nsibidi writing have been deployed for a largely satirical exposition of the African condition."2 I have studied and analyzed Igbo drawing and painting for many years, compared them with the Chinese tradition; spent time in the field recording and studying Igbo epics and minstrels; group-written four plays as a member of the Odunke Com- munity of Artists,3 founded during the Biafran War. I have traveled widely in different parts of the world, looking at the arts and cultures of many peoples. In the same spirit that European modernists borrowed from African sculpture and Japanese woodblock prints to revitalize their work and, by ex- tension, their tradition, I am open to using ideas or media from anywhere to advance my own work. For me, tradition is com- plex, flexible, and multilayered - both horizontally and verti- cally. One can perhaps see this reflected at another level, in my own marriage in 1982. First, there was a traditional ceremony (as portrayed in Chinua Achebe's novel Things Fall Apart) in my wife's village, followed by a "white" Christian wedding on my university campus and then a civil one at the marriage registry - an illustration of Ali Mazrui's "triple heritage."4 The Nsukka group of artists that I am associated with5 views the recourse to indigenous tradition as aligning with the Igbo aphorism "A na-esi n'uno a di mma, welu a pu ezi" (Charity begins at home) and complementing the ideology of "If you want to get a good view of a masquerader dancing, you do not stand in one place." This means that tradition is neither static nor rigidly localized. A traveler absorbs novel elements from other locations and melds them to the familiar; with time the foreign is seamlessly domesticated, giving rise to the new traditional. The Nsukka project was influenced by the con- cept of "Natural Synthesis" - the unforced blending of the best in indigenous and foreign art traditions - as espoused by Uche Okeke, Bruce Onobrakpeya, Demas Nwoko, Yusuf Grillo, Okechukwu Odita, Simon Okeke, and other members of the Art Society, a group of young college students at the then Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology, Za- ria, just before Nigeria's independence in 1960. Despite the multiple and diverse sources from which I have borrowed, however, Igbo aesthetics remains central to my work. It is the view of many Igbo cultural producers that talent emanates from God, the Earth Goddess, and "the Owner of Art," as is encapsulated in a statement by Okafo Okefi of Agulu that the sculptor bodies forth what "the grasses on the earth reveal to him."6 The Igbo refer to visual art as "ife nkili" (spectacle, something to be looked at [for pleasure]), and artists often use the expression "icho mma" (literally, to search for beauty, to decorate, to beautify) to describe aspects of their work. Mma also means "good" or "goodness." In addition, art has a functional or instrumental component, be it sculpture, pottery, textiles, masking, or minstrelsy. In gen- eral, both entertainment and message are central to the creative endeavor.7 How these twin elements are handled differs from artist to artist, for, as the traditional uli artists would say, "Uli di n'aka n'aka" ( Uli varies from hand to hand).8 This is a variant of the broader saying "Ike di n'awaja n'awsya" (Power runs in many channels),9 an acknowledg- ment of the multiplicity of individual endowment and spe- cialization. I see my art as the subconscious side of me working in concert with the deliberative or intellectual. Rhythms of the Threshold (Fig. 1), executed directly in the manner of a tra- ditional uli artist drawing on the human body without eras- ing, shows the lyrical manipulation of pure line, suggestive gestures, open spaces, and elaborate detailing. Some of these qualities are evident in the last segment of the large painting Where Something Stands . . . (2007). In addition to the abstract patterns ( akika ) and the spiral motifs (agwolagwo) derived from the uli repertoire, as well as the large nsibidi sign for mirror at the top right, I have introduced lines from Chris- topher Okigbo, Wole Soyinka, and Nnamdi Azikiwe in my ongoing exploration of image and calligraphic text. Apart from Igbo arts, my art and poetry benefited also from the examples of my predecessors, especially Uche Okeke, Ibra- him el Salahi, and Christopher Okigbo, who themselves learned from and enriched their own traditions. Looking ahead, I envisage that my practice will continue to be driven by a respect for the past and an awareness of myself, of my specific location temporally and geographically.</page><page sequence="3">520 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2013 VOLUME XCV NUMBER 4 Obiora Udechukwu is an artist and poet.

The first Odunke play, Veneration to Udo, group-written and performed in Biafra, was very critical of corruption in high places, and many peo- ple thought that members of Odunke would be arrested and detained. In the "Author's Note" to his novel Toads of War (London: Heinemann, 1979), [vii], Eddie Iroh remarked: "In writing this second volume of a trilogy I have drawn great inspiration from the Odunke Community of Artistes, whose lyrical insight into the civil war period remains a very significant creative appraisal of this tragic interlude. I express my utmost gratitude to them for the permission to adapt their dance-drama, Venera- tion to Udo, for this novel as well as the use of their various poems." In a note, Iroh added, "With a courage uncommon at the time, the play boldly attacked the decadence and perversion of the new nation, indict- ing the messiahs, the prodigals, the toads of war, the greedy disaster mil- lionaires who festered in the misery of war" (95 n. 3). 4.

In much the same way that the Chinese traditionally classified painters, reserving the highest or "divine" class ( shen ) for those whose works exuded an inexorable, mysterious aspect ( qi or ch'i, "life energy," "vital force") over and above the mastery of form and technique, the Igbo see certain art- ists as channels for the expression of the supernatural. Among the Mande, blacksmiths, sculptors, and other artists are held in awe because they can manipulate nyama, the life force. As the novelist Chinua Achebe (1930-2013) always claimed, storytelling chose him, not the other way around. 7.

" John Brewer At Cambridge University in the 1960s, my fellow students and I were implacably hostile to "tradition." We reveled in Quen- tin Skinner's denunciations from the podium of the British conservative philosopher and doyen of the National Review, Michael Oakeshott, whose critique of rationality and plaudits for change tempered by practice and tradition struck us as at once hopelessly limited and, in an easily heard echo of Ed- mund Burke, deeply opposed to any sort of rationally justi- fied radical innovation. Oakeshott and Burke were deemed to offer a descriptive and prescriptive account of change as a process of reverential accretion that we wanted (in somewhat contradictory fashion) both to deny and ignore. It is obvious, then, that we saw "tradition" as an unwelcome constraint, mortmain , the suffocating dead hand of our ancestors. This was pretty blind, as well as a sign of the times, because it threatened to inhibit us from addressing properly questions about the processes of artistic, political, and social change. Our case against the invocation of tradition - that it served as a means of avoiding those very same questions - still appears to me a telling one, though our own position, in retrospect, looks little better. All of which is to say that the tenor of these remarks is that claims based on "tradition," "traditions," and "the traditional" are worthy objects of scholarly criticism, but that "tradition" has very limited value as a term of critical analysis. This may seem provocative; it is intended to be so. But just think about the ways in which the term is used. As often as not the concept is platitudinous, flabby, and capa- cious - for example, in the use of such phrases as "the West- ern Tradition" in art, the Christian, Islamic, Chinese, Euro- pean, and so on, tradition.1 It provides a useful, often heuristic holdall that when put under any serious analytic pressure splits at the seams. When the term is used more specifically, as by those seeking to create a genealogy or canon - for example, in F. R. Leavis's The Great Tradition (1948) - it is frequently tendentious. When used as a precise descriptor, it often turns out to be little more than an elegant variation for "conventional or customary practices /values," as in Thomas Kuhn's discussion of "tradition-bound" scientific research,2 or as something more aptly described as a genre or style. It also serves as a shorthand reminder of the self-evident point that much artistic and intellectual facture refers - in a multitude of ways - back to its precursors. Of course, "tradi- tion" carries more freight than the term "convention," and it's the perlocutionary force (to use J. L. Austin's term) of the term's employment that raises red flags for me. To say of a belief or a practice that it is a tradition is to give it not just a certain character - to claim that its origins lie in an (ill-defined) past - but to invest it with a certain symbolic importance and to assert that its strengths lie in its continuity with the past, and that that continuity constitutes a part of its</page><page sequence="4">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: TRADITION 521 validation. Eric Hobsbawm makes this point in functionalist terms in his introduction to The Invention of Tradition (1983), the collected volume he and Terence Ranger edited. Tradi- tion making, he argued, was a means of legitimating certain practices and beliefs, of creating continuities, in order to cope with processes of rapid social change; its objects were the making of Gemeinschaft, the fabrication of certain sorts of community, the legitimation of (sometimes novel) institu- tions, and the inculcation of values, all of which laid claim to be traditional, and therefore legitimate and worthy of con- servation and transmission. Such claims, he emphasized, were more frequently made in "modern," as opposed to "customary" societies, but were not peculiar to them. Tradi- tion may not have been an invention of "modernity," but it has had a huge investment in the concept to which it is symbiotically tied. Think of "heritage," the commodity ver- sion of tradition, and "nostalgia," a modern disease that takes the form of hankering for a world we have apparently lost but, in fact, we never had. The great strength of The Invention of Tradition was that it demystified the transhistorical claim for tradition (s) to have existed "time out of mind" or since "time immemorial," and that it also dispelled the spatial miasma that surrounds the location of tradition, by administering a strong dose of history, reminding us that both the category "tradition" as well as many so-called traditions were rooted in specific and identifiable circumstances and chronologies, and that the continuities they claimed were, in Hobsbawm' s word, frequently "factitious."3 Hobsbawm and Ranger were interested in the creation of tradition (s), but much of the scholarship about artistic and literary practice, even when (perhaps especially when) enam- ored of the concept of tradition, has been concerned with what the literary critic Walter Jackson Bate called "the burden of the past." Here the play is not so much between traditional and modern as between traditional and original. In T. S. Eliot's 1919 essay "Tradition and the Individual Talent" and Harold Bloom's enormously influential, psychoanalytically informed study The Anxiety of Influence : A Theory of Poetry (1974), and in many an art historical monograph devoted to a single artist, we are presented with different accounts of how innovation and creativity, even genius, works. This has the virtue of grappling with the knotty question of the pro- cesses by which change and invention occur, though it is usually rather crudely formulated as a task of distinguishing plodding sheep from swift-footed goats, those who are over- awed by their predecessors and follow meekly in their foot- steps and those who succeed in surpassing or overtaking their predecessors, creating something new: thus, Eliot talks of "immature" and "mature" poets and Bloom of "poets" and "strong poets." These heroic accounts of creativity - whether, as in Eliot's case, as an act of creative self-effacement or "depersonalization" or, as with Bloom, through a series of confrontational misreadings of poetic forefathers - depend heavily on an idea of tradition, as seen from the artist's point of view. This sort of analysis is, of course, not new and can be found in the extremely rich classical and Renaissance discus- sions of imitation and aemulatio as mechanisms for cultural inheritance and transmission, though these tend to be more rigorous because less concerned with "a tradition" than with the relations between particular individuals or between par- ticular works. Transmission is a process whose recuperation enables us to answer the questions of how, why, and through whom it has occurred and to examine what has changed in the process. The range of possible answers to these questions is extraor- dinarily broad. Temporally linear models of cultural trans- mission embodied in the term "tradition" seem a rather parsimonious account of cultural and intellectual exchange and lock us into binaries shaped by concepts of innovation and originality. In short, "tradition" is mere reification, albeit, as Hobsbawm and his colleagues demonstrated, one of a most powerful kind.

Clarke Tradition can be defined as the practice of transmitting or handing down information, beliefs, and customs from one generation to another. In art history it is enacted layer upon layer, text upon text, image upon image: a process of aggre- gation. Printing, as visual art or as text on the page, played a seminal role in the transmission of tradition in Germany from Gutenberg on, and was especially significant following unification in 1871. Two artists making prints and writing books in the 1890s and early 1900s, Max Klinger and Max Liebermann, reveal how artists with different formal and methodological agendas revived and channeled the past in surprisingly interconnected ways. The etching revival that swept through Europe during the last half of the nineteenth century was, as its name indicates,</page><page sequence="5">522 ART bulletin December 2013 volume xcv number 4 1 Max Klinger, Battling Centaurs , etching and aquatint on paper, 16V£ X 10% in.

(artwork in the public domain; photograph by Michael Agee) looking back, as it "revived" a medium inextricably linked to the past. The etching revival in Germany, which gained mo- mentum in the 1880s and continued through the turn of the century, was supported economically by the state in a post- unification effort to teach and promote this purportedly urdeutsch medium. The raw woodcut style of the German Expressionists has long been understood as the pinnacle of graphic modernity after the turn of the century. However, their predecessors Klinger and Liebermann enacted similarly radical graphic programs, in both print and printed word, although their imagery and style may appear less progressive. During the 1890s, print production became a lively topic of debate in German art journals and the popular press. "Orig- inal" prints, created by the painter-printmaker, were pro- moted in contrast to "reproductive" prints, which were con- descendingly characterized as slavish copies and threatened by the encroachment of photography despite their popularity with a mass audience. Etchings were described by forward- thinking art writers as containing a poetic and subjective content that allowed viewers to project their own imaginative, intellectual readings onto the work of art. Imagination, intel- lect, and emotion were tied to the poet, the musician, and the graphic artist, who were considered the most spontaneously creative. Moreover, these forms of cultural production were understood as part of Germany's heritage, which was less the case for painting. Klinger, a painter, sculptor, and printmaker, won critical acclaim through his print series. Each of the fourteen port- folios, published between 1879 and 1915, was subtitled with opus numbers, thereby directly associating his prints with music. The fourth was titled Intermezzi , a musical term con- noting "in between." The montagelike excerpts that form the series of twelve prints included Battling Centaurs (Fig. 1), a work that exemplifies Klinger' s richly textured imagery. Bat- tling Centaurs depicts two beasts fighting over a dead rabbit as the magisterial German Alps rise up behind them. The artist frequendy incorporated motifs from antiquity, such as the centaur, impregnating them with issues relevant to contem- porary trends in literature, science, music, and philosophy. Klinger transformed motifs inherited through tradition into sociocritical weapons. Intermezzi contained many of Klinger' s hallmark visual and textual preoccupations, including Dar- winian evolution and Schopenhauerian pessimism. He sug- gestively complicated tradition, constructing subversive mes- sages of irony and desire within a high degree of formal realism, perhaps making his prints more palatable to the bourgeois market whose mores he critiqued.1 Max Liebermann, the powerful artist, collector, and co- founder of the Berlin Secession, turned to printmaking with a different formal vocabulary but no less complex relation to tradition. Displaying an Impressionist-inspired facture, Liebermann's prints have largely been considered as exten- sions of his paintings, repetitions of painted motifs in etched form. But during his lifetime, Liebermann's prints were con- nected (by himself and others) to the German past and to creative ideation, whereas his paintings were described (often in anti-Semitic terms) as French-inflected and derivative. Prints such as In the Pasture (Near Delden in Holland ) (Fig. 2), made in a combination of etching, soft-ground, and drypoint, self-consciously linked the artist to his second home in Hol- land and to the production of its most famous printmaker, Rembrandt. In the 1890s, Rembrandt was being co-opted as German by authors such as Julius Langbehn in his polemic Rembrandt as Educator (1890). While art critics allied Lieber- mann's oil paintings to nature via Impressionism and the hum- ble peasants he depicted, his prints were understood as mani- festations of his personality and individuality, the same terms used to describe Klinger's diametrically opposed imagery. Klinger and Liebermann each published important texts to promote and explain their art, especially their graphic pro- duction. Klinger's 1891 treatise Painting and Drawing cham- pioned the intellectual and creative drive behind drawn art (what he called Griffelkunst ), discussing prints and drawings as vehicles for invention and social criticism.2 His text was a descendant of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing' s seminal Laocoön, which differentiated painting from poetry, whereas Klinger distinguished graphic art from painting. Klinger argued that drawn art was most suitable for representing artistic personality via the world of fantasy and the imagination, enabling the artist to evoke a spiritual world akin to poetry and music. Above all,</page><page sequence="6">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: TRADITION 523 2 Max Liebermann, In the Pasture ( Near Delden in Holland), 1891, etching, soft- ground, and drypoint on paper, 7% X 9V4 in.

(artwork in the public domain) Klinger celebrated the subjectivity of drawn art, which offered the freedom to express one's interior world-view. Liebermann, writing a decade later, likewise considered drawing (and, by extension, printmaking) as the ultimate site of artistic creativity. As he argued in the 1901 catalog fore- word to the Berlin Secession's first "black-and-white" exhibi- tion: "a sketch provides the most immediate insight into [the artist's] creativity. Drawings undoubtedly make greater de- mands on the collaborative imagination of the viewer. . . . But only the viewer who has penetrated the hieroglyphics of the drawing will fully understand the completed work of art."3 Liebermann similarly built his artistic theories on German tradition and Romantic aesthetics, describing his own project as inextricably linked to imagination and poetry. He further elaborated on these ideas in a series of articles written be- tween 1904 and 1916 and published as Fantasy in Painting (1916), frequently invoking Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Lessing. Whereas Klinger subscribed to Lessing's notion of the poetic and imaginative as manifested in the "thought of the idea," Liebermann disagreed with Lessing and saw imagination manifested in the "thought of reality." One stressed content over form and the other form over content. Regardless of the differences in their imagery and formal styles, Klinger and Liebermann each described the drawn, printed, written, and etched line as revelatory of the inner thoughts of the artist/ author. The transmission of ideas through line - for artists, art historians, and philosophers - was a way to transform tradition into a living, modern idiom. This was a particularly national trait, a way to negotiate history while transforming the present, allowing culture to evolve continuously out of a shared, if illusory, sense of the past. Jay A.

Tapati Guha-Thakurta The idea of "tradition" once rose like a colossus over the field of Indian art history. As an idea embodying the antiquity and pedigree of the "nation," its authority remained firmly in place through the years in which the modern discipline emerged from its foundations in colonial scholarship and institutions to assert its status as an independent, nationalized</page><page sequence="7">524 ART bulletin December 2013 volume xcv number 4 1 Bhabatosh Sutar, Durga Puja installation, October 2012, Naktala Udayan Sangha Puja, Calcutta, enclosure with giant winged butterflies, made with wood, steel rods, wire mesh, and embossed cloth (photograph by the author, provided by the visual archives of the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta) domain of knowledge. At the same time, given the indeter- minacy and elasticity of the term, "tradition" would become one of the most intensely debated themes in Indian art historiography. Its meaning could be seamlessly expanded to cover the entire art of the past or to signify a religious dispen- sation and a spiritual aesthetic as the unique attributes of India's artistic classicism. It could be used to introduce specific stylistic conventions or treatises on architecture, sculpture, or painting, to scrutinize the vast complex of divine and secular iconogra- phies of Indian art, to break up the broad geographic unit of the "national" into an evolving grid of regional, vernacular styles, or to look beneath the canons of the "classical" or the "imperial" for the country's "living" heritage of crafts, ritual, and folk arts. In its most generalized usage and abstracted form, "tradition" is what best defined the "Indianness" of Indian art - that trou- bling yet never fully discarded concept that served its prime polemical ends at the turn of the twentieth century in coun- tering the hegemony of Western art and giving the nation's art its own rightful place in the global sphere. As an oppositional category, the "traditional" also acquired its main heuristic value in sharp contradistinction to the time and place of the "modern." Here, the field can be seen to have been continually split between the "traditional" and the "modern" along an overlapping set of temporal, normative, and social registers. So, for instance, it was clearly from the vantage perspective of modernity that the chronology of traditional periods, styles, and schools of Indian art could be constructed and given their elaborate art historical classifica- tions, distinguishing between major and minor genres, be- tween imperial and subimperial/regional trends, and be- tween India's deep archaeological antiquity and her continuing vernacular traditions of building, sculpting, or painting. By the same logic, it was only through a pointed sense of historical distance from all that constituted its "pre- modern" past that different phases and movements of the nation's modern art history could unfold, create its reserve pool of visual traditions to revive and reclaim, and define its own autochthonous twentieth-century narratives of modern- ism. Equally important was the social division that came into being in the sphere of practice between those who would take on the vocation of "artist" in modern India and the vast anonymous collective of those who were the temple builders, masons, sculptors, or painters of the past or those who car- ried on their work as the hereditary artisans, craftspeople, and folk practitioners of the day. From the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the modern lineage of the "art- ist" in India would be etched in pointed distinction from the heredity and milieu of these "traditional" art practices of the past and the present - whether they be of the temple sculptor and idol maker, the miniaturist and court painter, the fabri- cators of India's world-famous handicrafts, or the maker of tribal objects and wall paintings. These ideological formations of the "traditional" and the "modern" are now part of the distant past of Indian art history. In laying out this brief schematic framework, I be- came aware of how far back this also pushes into my own past of art historical research, done largely over the 1980s and 1990s, when I had worked, first, on the early colonial and nationalist contexts of the making of a new "Indian art" in modern Bengal, and later on the disciplinary and institu- tional apparatus of archaeology, art history, and museums in colonial and postcolonial India. The new scholarship of the past two decades has moved far from these deeply embedded polarities and divisions (which were once the constitutive core of the discipline) to radically dismande the overarching category of the "traditional" and relocate it within a series of historically contextual usages in art production and patron- age in different periods and regions.</page><page sequence="8">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: TRADITION 525 One of its most powerful thrusts, for instance, has been to pitch the weight of the "traditional" outside the time frame of the "premodern" into the popular image complexes of mod- ern and contemporary India - to show how a changing ico- nography of India's religious and mythological pantheon has grown out of the thick mesh of modern technologies of mass-production and circulation, linking the representa- tional idioms of the cheap picture print with the imaging devices of photography, cinema, or the latest digital media. In recent times, as Indian art history underwent its anthro- pologizing turn and reinvented its profile as "visual studies," its object worlds expanded provocatively to embrace a wid- ening range of productions and practices of the present - from popular calendar art to public religious and political statuary, from mega Hindu temple complexes that deploy the latest exhibitory technologies to folk art forms that confi- dently negotiate global themes and the international art market. In each case, we have been brought face to face with new creeds of images and image makers that fall between the traditional/ modern, religious/ secular, or artist/ artisan bi- naries. In each case, "tradition" (in the sense of inherited formal conventions, iconographies, or community practice) is made freshly serviceable for the current sectarian politics of caste, language, and region, even as it gears up to meet the new demands of mass spectatorship and corporate publici- ties. It is within this rapidly mutating field that I would also locate my current ethnographic engagement with a contem- porary genre of "festival art" that has grown around Bengal's annual autumnal celebrations centered on the worship of the goddess Durga. My "notes from the field" here remain steeped in the thick layers of a vernacular tradition of, first, the emergent iconography of the goddess, where Durga's martial image as slayer of the buffalo demon blends with her maternal image of a married daughter returning to her pa- rental home every year with her four divine children, and, second, a hereditary practice of anthropomorphic image making in alluvial clay that dates back to the eighteenth century, if not earlier. My main concern has been with the way this iconographie and sculpting tradition is being cre- atively ťeworked in the cause of a new urban "public" art, as the ritual occasion of the Durga Pujas in the city of Calcutta has transformed itself into a weeklong exhibitory event, de- signed for popular touring and viewing. The field today is filled with aspirant artists (many from backgrounds barely distinguishable from those of artisans and craftsmen) who have today taken to Durga Puja designing as a lucrative profession and are creating their own signature-style Durga images and pavilion enclosures to attract competition awards and corporate sponsors (Figs. 1,2). Why do they choose to invest such intensity of artistic aspirations and so many months of thought and labor into these ephemeral displays? What sustains the name and claims of "art" within the body of the religious event and this space of mass festivity? How does the goddess assume her concurrent identities as a devotional 2 Bhabatosh Sutar, Durga Puja installation, October 2012, Naktala Udayan Sangha Puja, Calcutta, synchronized iconography of a winged goddess Durga, clay sculpture (photograph by the author, provided by the visual archives of the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta) object, an advertising brand image, and a collectible work of art in the life of the festival? What enables such open-ended transactions between avowedly "sacred" and "secular" worlds of image making and reception? Tradition, I would argue, remains an ever-fertile ground of the present where each such question sown can yield a bounty of answers, and where many of the given provenances of "artist," "art object," or "art viewer" can be dug up and tossed around to redefine the scope of Indian art history.

But he respects tradition. Not only does he respect it, he looks upon it as upon something real and objective which has to be studied and, if necessary, reinstated."1 If we situate this text historically in the year in which it was first published - 1940 - it is quite clear that it not only refers to academic issues, but it also defines an ideolog- ical position. Panofsky pleads for the values of the Western tradition of enlightenment and democracy, which at this time were under immediate threat from the dictatorships of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. However, considered as a general characteristic of the task of art history, it becomes more problematic. Panofsky' s characterization reads as a tra- ditionalist appeal to the humanist to devote his or her energy to preserve and defend the enduring values that tradition carries, even if there is also a demand to look critically at authority per se. One can ask, though, if the art historian as humanist does not have a broader and more critical task. The word "tradition" is insidious. It belongs to our familiar, everyday vocabulary, and it simultaneously holds a great va- riety of connotations that make it quite difficult to define. In its basic, etymological form, the meaning of tradition appears to be unproblematic: it can be derived directly from the Latin traditio , which, according to Edward Shils, was "a mode of transferring the ownership of private property in Roman Law," whereas nowadays it means "whatever is persistent or recurrent through transmission, regardless of the substance or institutional setting."2 To define one's practice as part of a tradition is, then, to pass on values of a long-established and continuing pattern of cultural beliefs or practices (state- ments, legends, customs, information, and so forth) . Accord- ingly, the word "tradition" embraces the trivia of everyday life as well as the fundamental issues that define one's worldview. But it seems clear that the problem with the word "tradition" is not so much its definition as its function: how it is used, in what context it occurs, with what purposes - or, in short, what the word does (as J. L. Austin could have put it) . It is possible to distinguish at least two basic functions brought to bear by the word "tradition," whatever the con- text: first, that it identifies a temporal continuity , and second, that it marks a distinction. Whether we are talking about a tradition or manifesting a tradition, the concept includes two elements that serve as cornerstones in any production of meaning, identity, and context. Here we also touch on the core of the ideological aspects of the word: as it performs a distinction that discriminates what is included in a designated context from what is excluded, it creates rituals and attributes that tie us together and separate "us" from "them." At the core of the meaning of the word "tradition" there is a figure of thought that seems to be common to any kind of produc- tion of personal, cultural, or academic identity, as well as a derogatory denial of anything or anyone outside the borders of the distinction. If such an attitude operates in an unre- flected way, it could, obviously, constitute a profound ethical and/ or epistemological problem. The use and reuse of tradition in the modern era can be seen as both a passive and an active attitude: as an unreflec- tive approach to relate to things as they have always been comprehended or as an active reaction to a perceived threat and a means of defense. Hans-Georg Gadamer understands the enhancement and defense of tradition in the Romantic movement as a conscious opposition to the Enlightenment's emphasis on progress, science, observability, and objectivity.3 These two movements could be perceived as two fundamen- tal and dissonant modes of what we define as modernity. It is pointless to try to delegitimize any one of them as reaction- ary, as they are intertwined in every cultural, philosophical, or ideological direction that is not considered to be revolution- ary. From this perspective it is possible to understand Panof- sky's plea for a traditionalistic approach as a way to define a situation in which the open society makes use of Tradition as a bulwark against oppression and tyranny as well as a neces- sary transmission of the scientific progressivity of the Enlight- enment. Such an approach has proved to be crucial, not least in the last decades, in the political, social, and academic fields, where economic cuts have gone hand in hand with the rise of populist and nationalist forces. The open society is not to be taken for granted, neither in 1940 nor in 2013. Still, it seems to me that the stipulation of a context - whether of the Western tradition of the open society or of the idea of an antiauthoritarian academic ideal - as something to be taken for granted is doubtful. Instead, context should be conceived as something always in need of redefinition and argument. In my opinion, we ought to bring the views of both Panof- sky and Gadamer closer to the idea of the emancipatory function of science and scholarly traditions that Jürgen Ha- bermas enunciates in his definition of "Knowledge-constitu- tive interests" in his Frankfurt inaugural address of 1965.4 He stipulates a distinction between natural science, humanities, and social sciences in order to highlight the progressive nature of the latter (the field in which he himself was about to attain a chair) at the expense of the others - in particular, the humanities, which he defines stereotypically, according to the hermeneutic views of the day, as a tradition-laden branch of conservation and mediation. Here we enter the realm of critical theory of the 1970s and the alternative directions and canons of the New Art History and visual studies in the following decades. As opposed to Panofsky' s iconological stance for the development of art history in the postwar era, one could address Roland Barthes's "Rhétorique de l'image" as a similarly canonical perspective for the for- mation of visual studies in the 1990s: where the former asks what the image means, the latter asks how it means; where the former talks about intrinsic meaning, the latter examines meaning as a cultural and ideological construction; where the former defines the goal of interpretation as reaching the artwork' s core of meaning, the latter outlines its task as understanding the context in which meaning is established</page><page sequence="10">and normalized; where the former comprehends the goal for the humanities as transmitting the content of Tradition, the latter perceives that goal as the exposure and analysis of the ideological context of the image and tradition.5 In this intellectual showdown, it is perhaps easy enough to sympathize with Barthes's perspective. At the same time, I cannot but feel ambivalence toward this comparison. What is at stake here is not some kind of a judgment about whether one intellectual position is more radical than another, whether you like or dislike Tradition as such, but to what extent one obtains an awareness and capacity for critical reflection on one's own intellectual and ideological position. A consciousness of this type could be called critical historiog- raphy. Critical historiography regards Tradition - and, actu- ally, all kinds of traditions - as something real, as something one is obliged to investigate. In addition, the task of a critical historiography is to examine critically the premises taken for granted in each tradition - and, ultimately, to reflect deeply on those premises for one's own intellectual position. Such a critically reflexive approach is, to my mind, a tradition a humanist has to respect and, if necessary, to reinstate. NOTES FROM THE FIELD: TRADITION 527 Hans Hayden is J. A.

Horowitz The concept of "tradition," when not used in the narrowly anthropological sense as a synonym for folkways, has nowa- days an ineluctable fustiness about it. Anyone who uses it in its normative sense, as a source of justification for judgment and action, is in danger of being dragged backward into a way of thinking that is traditional in the narrowly anthropological sense. No doubt there are many reasons for the deliques- cence of tradition, but here are two. First, "tradition" serves a synthetic function insofar as it enables us to build structures of meaning out of a welter of historical materials. We are, however, currently living through a time of grand and festive dispersal, in which the worry over chaos and confusion that motivated caretakers of tradition has to all appearances lost its bite. David Joselit, for example, argues in his recent lec- tures After Art that to understand art in our global and digital world we must turn away-from Walter Benjamin's thesis that ours is the age of the decay of art's aura, which melancholi- cally maintains an orientation toward and from the past, and instead treat art as circulating anarchically in decentered distribution networks.1 In Joselit's view, analyzing art in the space of tradition is, if not exactly wrong, at least untimely. Second, tradition building, like its sister practice of canon formation, seeks to shore up meaning against the passing of time, the drift of memory, and the heaping up of catastrophe. Insofar as no tradition can do its work without a principle of conservation that saves only some (objects, events, ideas) from the flood of historical change, tradition building has fallen under the equally principled suspicion of capricious selectivity and exclusivity. We find a compelling instance of the refusal to choose at the Museum of Modern Art's Invent- ing Abstraction, 1 910-1 925.2 The first work of art we see at the exhibition is Pablo Picasso's Woman with Mandolin , a nearly abstract painting of 1910 that, almost in the last ditch, shores up diagrammatically its disappearing referentiality. The image that greets us, however, is the curators' wall chart of the dense network of relationships out of which the world of abstract art emerged. The contrast is striking: Picasso's painting struggles to embody the idea of a world the artist is not sure he can capture, while the curators' network-image replaces the nar- ration of the historical world with intensities and lines of force that, although perhaps searchable, are not navigable. The arrogance of locating works within a tradition - which is really nothing more than the arrogance of judgment - is forbidden in our posttraditional atmosphere of indifferent, which is to say largely academic, egali tarianism. Yet two considerations, one analytic and the other ethico- political, ought to make us hesitate before acquiescing to relegate the concept of tradition to the dustbin of history. The analytic point first. Even if everything solid has melted into air, the neglect of the relation of art to tradition threat- ens to leave our understanding of our present moment un- anchored not merely from the traditions that have, let us grant, ceased to nourish us, but also from the history that has ex hypothesi proven to be the universal solvent of techniques of transmission. Let us recall that tradition in its normative sense is not simply a fancy name for the past but for the past constituted as a cognitive, ethical, and political authority in the here and now. Whether one leans toward the Eliotic view of tradition as what an artist subserves in order to unlock artistic power in the present or the contrary and stormier Bloomian view of tradition as what an artist must, on threat of losing artistic power, reshape by revolting against, tradition is</page><page sequence="11">528 ART bulletin December 2013 volume xcv number 4 the medium that delivers the past's authoritative self-under- standings to the present and in which the present tests and discovers its own formative powers. This is the thought Karl Marx had in mind when, in order to discredit the idea that we can be free in our thinking while unfree in our lives, he asserted that "men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under cir- cumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past."3 Marx's dialectical point is that the terms in which we come to grips with our present condition are themselves transmitted by the same history with which we struggle. To think histor- ically about the present requires analyzing not just our cur- rent historical moment but also the conditions and resources of thinking itself as artifacts (products, relics, ruins) of pre- vious human struggles. Even if the present of and in which we try to make sense is oddly detached from its own history, we still need to apprehend our sense-making apparatus as inher- ited. Tossing the concept of tradition overboard in the face of the very real transformations of contemporary modes of meaning making yields, in this light, not freedom from his- tory but cognitive powerlessness to reflect on it. On pain of generating a phonier universal than the concept of tradition ever was, we must continue to find ways to understand the history that has washed us up on these shores with this set of analytic tools. Looked at from this materialist point of view, "tradition" names not some particular inheritance from the past, not the Classical Tradition or the Marxist Tradition or what have you, but more broadly the way we take up our inescapably histor- ical nature. It designates not the past as such but the past as inherited and reshaped by creatures with culture and mem- ory. And this brings us to the ethico-political reason to slow ourselves down before acceding to the mad rush of the future. Tradition refers to how the past is taken up in the light and shadow of the present day. Such a thought invites us to consider that tradition does not really designate the past at all but the persistence of the past in the present and future. Tradition is the unwilled power of the past that, not having finished its business in its own time, offers us here and now the occasion to turn it to new purposes. ("Tradition" and "treason," it is worth recalling, share a common root; to carry away what has been left behind is also to betray it.) Tradition, then, is not simply the inert past but the past sublimated into artifacts, images, and ideas that are on the march. No one has grasped this better than that fustiest of thinkers, Matthew Arnold, who attributed the passing of the political authority of the European aristocracy to that class's "fail[ure] to appre- ciate justly, or even to take into their mind, the instinct pushing the masses towards expansion and fuller life." Ar- nold concludes the thought by saying, "It is the old story of the incapacity of the aristocracies for ideas, the secret of their want of success in modern times."4 Tradition as mutability grounds both traditional and nontraditional understandings of the past - grounds nontraditional understandings, I would even say, only insofar as it also grounds traditional under- standings. Only when authority circulates as tradition is it ripe for the taking. Gregg M. Horowitz is professor of philosophy and chair of Social Science and Cultural Studies at Pratt Institute.

Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann In Goethe's Faust Margarete (Gretchen) asks, "Nun sag, wie hast du's mit der Religion?" ("Now tell me, how do you stand with religion?") When Faust equivocates, her question "Do you believe in God?" gets right to the heart of the matter, and forces him to deflect her further with more rationalizing generalizations. After Gretchen has left the scene, Mephis- topheles enters and says pointedly that the sort of answer that would have pleased her was one "nach altem Brauch."1 Gretchen 's question not only causes Faust discomfiture but also directly brings up a notion of "tradition." For art history, tradition is a Gretchenfrage. Tradition, often defined as something handed down or copied from one person or generation to another, has helped art historians describe and classify patterns and series of images and objects and to provide a measure against which innovation can be judged. Art historians have long talked about traditions of style or representation.2 Traditions of discourse might be said to define the field, because arguments are situated in the context of ongoing discussions of problems; in contrast, while efforts may be made to establish normative or categorical definitions of art and its history, they cannot possibly always hold against change in time. Yet, tellingly, even in the ex- panded edition of Critical Terms for Art History tradition did not merit mention.3 There are many reasons tradition raises uncomfortable questions. The discourses of art criticism and art history</page><page sequence="12">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: TRADITION 52Q emerged while Enlightenment thinkers were subjecting tra- ditional ideas and beliefs - including religion, the point of the Gretchenfrage - to rational critique. As an outcome of the revolutions of the late eighteenth century many of the insti- tutions, ways of thinking, and social bonds of the ancien régime came to an end. The historicist and historical deter- minist presuppositions inherent in many fields, including art history, that developed in the nineteenth and early twentieth century did not leave much place for the assumption of a transhistorical element of continuity as implied by tradition, on the one hand;4 on the other, art history often deployed diachronic notions of nations and peoples that have been fully discredited.5 Modernist thought and practice have fur- ther severed connections with the past. Moreover, as writers of a postmodernist and poststructuralist disposition have stressed, traditions are hardly unified and coherent but in- stead are contingent, hybrid, and shared as well. "Radical discontinuities and ruptures, the suppressions and recover- ies" have become evident even in the Greco-Roman heritage that once seemed to hold together European culture; the very term "tradition" seems to pose such problems that the learned editors of a massive recent guide to the classical tradition did not attempt to define it.6 The coexistence of multiple temporalities and the combi- nation of cultural traditions in the same work are, however, hardly new discoveries.7 Complexities of temporality and tra- dition have also been the stock-in-trade of art historians, including two thinkers who have recently garnered consider- able attention in discussions of these themes. Aby Warburg certainly dealt with the discontinuities of tradition, beginning with his dissertation, when he began to ask why and how bewegtes Beiwerk transcended time and place, ultimately an- swering with the "pathos formula." Warburg also wrote about how traditions are "international," how images travel and combine traces from apparently the most disparate sources: in his treatment of the Palazzo Schifanoia in Ferrara he explicated how astral images appearing in Italian art derive from Indian and Arabic transformations of Greco-Roman astrology.8 Nevertheless, the titles of the professorship held by Warburg's close associates Fritz Saxl and Gertrud Bing and those who have followed as directors of the Warburg Institute indicate that Warburg's creation has been received as being centrally concerned with the classical tradition.9 George Kubier, whose Shape of Time opened up new ways of thinking about temporal discontinuities, was, however, simultaneously extremely concerned with chronology, and he envisioned the contemporaneity of monuments that might seem to be sep- arate stages in disparate series.10 At the same time, Kubier wrote about the "fiber-like struc- ture of temporal stages," and also compared the continuous production of art to the "fiber of the weft thread which is woven strongly with the warp formed by . . . the various insti- tutional functions, political, economic, and military" in the "cloth in progress" that is civilization.11 Such descriptions may in the end help explain why, to paraphrase Meyer Scha- pira, a theory of tradition adequate to the psychological and historical problems has still to be created.12 Along with spe- cific studies, metaphor and poetry may be more appropriate than attempts to supply nomothetic definitions for the place of tradition in the vast geographic and temporal weave of art.13 They give voice to an unwritten philosophy of human history.14 Another passage from Faust readily comes to mind: "Grau, teurer Freund, ist alle Theorie /und grün des Lebens goldner Baum" (Gray, dear friend, is all theory and green Life's golden tree).15 Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann , Frederick Marquand Professor of Art and Archaeology, Princeton University , has published widely on historiography , geography of art , and art history from 1450 to 1800 , most recently , Arcimboldo: Visual Jokes, Natural History, and Still-Life Painting.

Archaeologists, for example, have pointed to the importance of mud to the development of pottery, to the domestication of plants and animals, and to the formation of settled societies,2 while anthropologists, art historians, and architectural historians have begun to examine the selective take-up of materials in the making of social worlds and the creation of civilizations.3 From an overt concern with the social forms of art, a power- ful, but by no means new, question has emerged, enthralling social and historical sciences alike, directed at the nature of empathy with a shared manifold of ideas, attitudes, and vo- cabularies that is carried within bundles of materials.4 Cul- tures of materials, we no longer dare to deny, are good to think with when it comes to understanding how societies recognize one another and remember themselves.5 Following David Pye, materials are widely assumed to act as a constraint on technical processes and social imagination.6 Preoccupied with overcoming such constraints, we rarely en- tertain the prospect that the seizing of a material is never random but follows a logic that never targets one material in isolation, instead proceeding relationally via the perception of bundles of materials,7 whether they are at hand or not. This logic shapes not just the selection and take-up of materials but also the relative mobility of materials and their substitu- tion by other materials over time - raising interesting ques- tions about the boundaries of cultures of materials and their civilizational importance. Material translation, the process by which materials are substituted for one another, brings to the fore the power of relational thought at work in materials selection. Materials are a foothold for thought, tangible threads along which thought can extend itself, and can be held as memory in much the same way as gestures and numbers. We know that materials have their own measure, their character- istic weight, malleability, durability, transformational capac- ity, and elective affinity with other materials. When materials are substituted in manufacture, the action- and thought- oriented relational measure of materials becomes overt, as quantities are transformed into qualities and are made avail- able to conscious elaboration. Material translation is most straightforwardly perceived when a new material is chosen to do the same job as an existing one. The technical term for this is skeuomorphism. In short, a skeuomorph is an artifact that is made from some new material that is taking on (inheriting) characteristics of the original material that the artifact was made in, even though these may no longer serve any function. The Welling- ton boot is the best example of material agency made visible through acts of translation, in that the seam at the back of the rubber boot makes visible the joining of the original leather. It is via the quite unnecessary seam at the back of the boot, rather than its own material, shape, or function, that the Wellington boot "works" as an affect-laden actor among our footware - one that we tend to keep, even if old and battered. It is, however, arguably the action invited by the material and its relation to other possible actions, not the material itself, that is putting body, mind, and world into a certain relation with one another. An instance is the take-up of colored woven cloth in the Oceania of the late nineteenth century, selected by allowing existing gestures of the body and calculations of the mind to be translated from fibrous planar materials into a new medium. The material translation of fibrous bark into woven cloth, however, also brought with it ways of inhabiting this material technology. New modes of deportment, new relational actions - washing, drying, and flattening - began to inform new intersubjective relations, new networks of exchange, and new cosmologies of divest- ment that are intuitively recognized and shared.8 Cloth began to be harnessed for purposes of material translation when the figurative representation of the connec- tion between two concepts, the visible and the invisible, first came under threat in Polynesia with the arrival of Christian- ity. Patchworks known as tifaifai/ tivaivai are today the iconic markers of identity across the islands of Hawaii, Tahiti, and the Cook Islands. A taunga or gift - a must-have at every wedding, birthday, and funeral and the main gauge of com- munity relations - extends the mind of the maker tangibly to all those through whose hands it passes, creating huge net- works in its wake. If we look at tivaivai as a tradition that connects persons to one another via the act of exchange, we have just half the story. The power to connect in fact lies in the associative force of this rather nonfunctional piecework - made from material you cannot wash and using a mode of assemblage of time-consuming effort, always done by hand and involving careful calculation. The patchwork quilt calls up beneath its folds another, now invisible, material, refer- encing in its embellishment a culture of materials whose rela- tional logic is absent, yet not forgotten. Cultures of materials, the tivaivai teaches us, are composed not just of what is used and consumed but also of what may merely be remembered.

Loh How does one begin to write about "tradition" if not with a quote? In an old house in Paris that was covered with vines . . . Here is where the majority of those who were children, who have children, or have ever watched over small children in the United States will know that the next lines can only unfold as such: . . . lived twelve little girls in two straight lines. In two straight lines they broke their bread And brushed their teeth and went to bed. They smiled at the good and frowned at the bad, Sometimes they were very sad. They left the house at half past nine In two straight lines in rain or shine - The smallest one was Madeline.1 This is the opening of Ludwig Bemelmans's story Madeline ; this is the very stuff of tradition - the things that impress themselves on our tender young memories. Long after we have all grown up and become serious art historians, the words "In an old house in Paris" will still evoke a distant time when those words (and words from other storybooks, like Margaret Wise Brown's Goodnight Moon or Dr. Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham) represented the small sum of our cultural knowledge about the large world beyond ourselves. Connoisseurs might direct the reader's attention to Bemel- mans's beloved Central Park paintings, which still grace the walls of the bar that bears the artist's name in the Carlyle Hotel in New York City. Biographers might note that Bemel- mans was the child of Belgian and German parents and made his way in the United States after World War I. Wikipedia can even detail the site of his burial plot in Arlington National Cemetery: section 43, grave 2618. But all of this is, in a sense, beside the point. Tradition is not founded on data, but on the spectral presence of the past that suddenly erupts, often when we least expect it to, in our everyday lives. Tradition (like children) thrives when we lavish attention on it. Some- times tradition can be unruly, obstinate, and resistant, but (again, as with children) it is our duty to embrace it all the same and try to help it find its way in a world that is of our making. Occasionally, too, it teaches us something extraordi- nary about that world. A few days shy of Christmas some years ago, I found myself at 54, Rue du Château, standing before what I had expected to be an old house in Paris (just like in the books of my childhood) . Let me retrace my steps: earlier that morning, in the deserted study room of the Musée du Louvre, I had visited a bizarre drawing by Bartolomeo Passerroti of a dis- section scene supervised by a group of identifiable Renais- sance art stars (Fig. 1). In the center, Michelangelo converses with Sebastiano del Piombo while Raphael lectures a group of attentive artists, and Titian lurks in the background, like a grumpy adolescent, with another gang.2 Here and now I am thinking of the beginning of Roland Barthes's Camera Lucida , where he is looking at a photograph of Napoléon's brother and is struck in that instance: "I am looking at eyes that looked at the emperor."3 For Barthes the "that-has-been" was specific to photography, but for the historian, the "ça-a-été" haunts all objects. Then and there - Thursday, December 22, 2011 - I was holding a sheet of paper once held by Passerotti, an all-but-forgotten specter who was the founder of one of the first informal art schools in Bologna and the teacher of the Carracci. As in the atemporal space of a sacra conversazione , artists of dif- ferent generations gather together in his sketch for what might be described figuratively as an early modern "exqui- site corpse."4 By the time Passerotti made the drawing, in the late six- teenth century, most of the men portrayed in the gathering were themselves already gone. The melancholic encounter with such an illustrious pantheon of ghosts left me feeling bereft; like a Proustian cliché, I began to wander the streets of the fourteenth arrondissement in search of Marcel Du- hamel' s house at 54, Rue du Château, where the Surrealists were said to have gathered to compose the mythical cadavre exquis. By all accounts, Duhamel' s residence was a haven for young artists in his circle. In the interwar years, he worked as a hotel manager and generously paid the rent that kept his</page><page sequence="15">532 ART bulletin December 2013 volume xcv number 4 1 Alone with a drawing by Bartolomeo Passerotti in the Département des Arts Graphiques, Musée du Louvre, Paris, Thursday, December 22, 2011 (photo- graph by the author) creative (but largely unemployed) friends off the streets. But on that chilly late December afternoon, standing at the top of this historic site just off the roundabout at the Place de Catalogne beyond Montparnasse Cemetery, I was confronted instead by a banal building dressed up in cookie-cutter orna- ments (as if a modern block had arrived at an architectural costume party in Renaissance gear). No house, no vines; it hardly even looked like Paris. In this amnesiac lieu de mémoire, I - the belated time traveler - was mysteriously greeted in- stead by a sign that bore my name and yet was not my name: Pizzeria via Maria (Fig. 2). They smiled at the good and frowned at the bad, some- times they were very sad . . . Loss. Disappointment. Frustration. Surprise. Enchantment. This is the historian's affective journey. Some part of me - the ghost in me - couldn't help but laugh. The Surrealists would undoubtedly have relished the fateful desecration of their residence by these large yellow and green letters that pronounced a foreign name floating above a kidney-colored canopy, and this play of chance somewhat fortuitously brought me - the foiled historian - in a second unscripted move, back to the Louvre just on the other side of the River Seine where in a locked cabinet Passerotti's drawing was preserved. Reflecting back on the Anatomy Lesson : the intimacy and creative collectivity that must have animated those exhilarat- ing nocturnal meetings in Duhamel' s drawing room in the mid-1920s suddenly endowed on Passerotti's image a new sense of sympathetic attachment that allowed both traditions to vibrate more intensely in each other's presence. By the time the Surrealists were mounting their revolution, the hopeful dream of the early modern art academies (forged by</page><page sequence="16">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: TRADITION 533 2 54, Rue du Château, Paris, Thursday, December 22, 2011 (photograph by the author) 3 "But the biggest surprise by far - on her stomach was a scarf ' from Ludwig Bemelmans's Madeline , New York: Simon and Schuster, 1939 (photograph by Gabriel Loh) men like Passerotti) had become obscured by centuries of institutional interference, and the Utopian corpus academicus as portrayed in the Louvre drawing had faded into a history of which the young men at 54, Rue du Château had long since lost sight. And yet . . . despite the cultural, economic, political, and philosophical specificities that would sequester them in their respective historical moments, both traditions were bound by the same dream of artistic fraternity and collective creativity: In two straight lines they broke their bread And brushed their teeth and went to bed.</page><page sequence="17">534 ART bulletin December 2013 volume xcv number 4 Two straight lines might not necessarily converge, but occa- sionally there is one, often the smallest one, who unexpect- edly rises up and scrambles the order, producing new con- figurations and sympathies hitherto unseen (Fig. 3). Moreover, a continuous line does not have to be unidirec- tional like the linearity of a master narrative. Sometimes a line, even a straight one, crosses back and over on itself, accumulating in dense ink blots, skipping across the surface, or retracing its own steps; risk and time are always a factor.5 Like Duhamel's house, which is lost to us today, this punc- tum caecum gets to the heart of the historian's task: we must strive to see the ghosts of the past in the forms of the present, and vice versa, to comprehend the aspiration of the Surrealist revolution as shadows of a reform or as lines in a continuous drawing - an exquisite corpse - begun centuries ago by someone like Passerotti.6 Tradition is an exquisite haunting. The time of ghosts is always out of joint, just as the past and the future are always already the haunted present tense of tradition.7 "In an old house in Paris that was covered with vines" a man who is now a phantom once divined: "The future belongs to ghosts! . . . long live ghosts!"8 To be sure, tradition is born from the sympathetic attachments that we keep for the specters of our own distant childhoods, ghosts that we nourish and that nurture us in return. Tradition is an exquisite corpse. Maria H. Loh is a Reader in the Department of History of Art at University College London and the Willis F.

Phillips Until the 1980s the authenticity of Native North American art was defined according to a construct of the traditional as premodern and immutable. Modernist primi tivism was tradi- tion's other face, enforcing adherence to certain media, styles, and modes of production.1 Johannes Fabian termed the imaginary time associated with representations of Indig- enous peoples the "ethnographic present," and his 1983 identification of the "allochronism" and "denial of coeval- ness" produced by modernist anthropological discourse pro- vided analytic clarity for a postcolonial project of deconstruc- tion.2 Since the mid-1980s this project has proceeded in two registers, one a scholarly and reflexive critique of anthropological and art historical discourses, and the other a critical reimaging pursued by Native North American artists. In a 1986 essay, J. C. H. King succinctly summarized the circularity of modern attempts to distinguish the traditional and the nontraditional in Native American art: The concept of the "nontraditional" . . . reflects stereo- typed ideas about Indians and expectations of art appro- priate to noble savages untainted by Western society, which in turn altered (if it did not devastate) their ideal products. This judgment is, in the end, of no use since it is based on unworkable ideal types of what Indians should be in order to be traditional [which] depend on the imposition of Western standards on Indian art.3 He showed how patterns of collecting had resulted in a lack of basic documentation needed to attribute works of art to times, places, and individual artists. Scholarly work is begin- ning to restore some of this information, and we now under- stand more about the ways that Native American artists have negotiated received traditions and the larger processes of change, hybridization, and reinvention that Indigenous arts, like all art traditions, have undergone. In tandem, contemporary Native American artists have been grappling with the pervasive stereotypes inscribed by representations of American Indians in Western art and pop- ular culture. These images have worked together with past collecting practices to fix the Indian in a frozen past, cut off from modern, urban worlds and their institutions - including art schools and museums. Onondaga photographer Jeffrey Thomas's series A Conversation with Edward Curtis and Cree</page><page sequence="18">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: TRADITION 535 artist Kent Monkman's repaintings of the nineteenth-century corpus of artists such as George Catlin, Charles Russell, Fred- eric Remington, and others exemplify the critical engage- ment of Native American artists with this tradition. Curtis intended the photographs that fill the twenty vol- umes of The North American Indian (1907-30) to "form a comprehensive and permanent record of all the important tribes of the United States and Alaska that still retain to a considerable degree their primitive customs and traditions."4 He produced his intensely romantic images by staging reen- actments of traditional life and carefully excising any indica- tion that his subjects inhabited a modern world. Thomas recalls the beginning of his engagement with Curtis in 1984 during a walk through downtown Toronto with his young son Bear: I noticed a brick wall spray painted with the words "Cul- ture Revolution." I stopped at the wall to photograph, but decided instead to have Bear pose next to the graffito so that he could have a memento of our day. Once I devel- oped the print in my darkroom. . . . the unexpected con- vergence of visual elements changed my view of the urban landscape. . . . Bear was wearing a baseball cap with an image of an Indian man by the name of Two Moons made by Edward S. Curtis in 1910. Two Moons was a respected Cheyenne leader and a participant in the infamous battle of The Little Big Horn in 1876. Together the image of Two Moons with the words culture revolution, made me realize that if I was going to make the invisible urban- Indian visible, I had to take on the role of an intervention- ist.5 The photograph (Fig. 1) launched Thomas's series A Con- versation with Edward Curtis, realized through juxtapositions of Curtis' s images and his own. In 2005 this conversation entered a new register with a second series, Rebinding the North American Indian, in which Thomas continues the series where Curtis had left it off, by adding his own paired images as new, consecutively numbered plates. Plate 724, for example, shows us Two Moons next to a teenage Bear in an urban-industrial setting (Fig. 2). Rather than a deconstructive dismantling, Thomas's dip- tychs reveal the complex cross-cultural resonances of a now shared body of mass-circulated images. Such pairings imply a measure of acceptance, a recognition that Curtis's images have penetrated too deeply to be merely dismissed. The psychic toll exacted by the stereotype is redeemed in part by Thomas's recognition of the indexicality of Curtis's images, which he sees as traces - often unique and therefore pre- cious - of ancestral lives. His juxtapositions initiate a mutual interrogation, each acknowledging the entangled elements of truth and fiction present in each of the images. Monkman came to art world attention during the 1990s with a series of meticulously executed repaintings of the romantic nineteenth-century depictions of Indian life that are the beaux arts equivalents of Curtis's photographs. His key strategy of subversion is a homoerotic inversion of the messages of white male dominance these paintings convey. White men appear in the positions usually occupied by Indi- ans; eroticized, seduced, and objectified, they become disem- 1 Jeffrey Thomas, Culture Revolution , 1984, pigment print on archival paper, 17 X 22 in. (43.2 X 55.9 cm). Collection of the artist (artwork © Jeffrey Thomas) powered, passive, and mesmerized. More recently, Monkman has extended his strategy of inversion to the full span of canonical Western art. His 2012 series Modern Love is per- haps his most comprehensive engagement yet.6 In each of the giclée prints, an artist, represented as Umberto Boccio- ni 's sculpture Unique Forms of Continuity in Space , sits at an easel, painting a modernist work while the male Indian model from whom he works reclines in the pose of the Barberini Faun. In each of the twenty-five images in the series, Monkman varies the model's state of dress and nudity (Roman armor, fringed hide leggings) , the painting style of the image on the canvas (Joan Miró, Pablo Picasso, Mark Rothko), the objects displayed in the room (Northwest Coast masks, classical weapons, animal skulls). As in his other re- paintings, Monkman takes control of the art historical narra- tive through tricksterish transformations that manifest the magic powers of Indigenous "tradition" - and the equally magic powers of artists. Thomas's and Monkman's works exorcize the paralyzing force exerted by tradition when defined from the outside at the same time that they affirm the shared frames of reference of our increasingly global art world. For Dipesh Chakrabarty, this decolonizing and globalizing shift requires that we "pro- vincialize 'Europe.' " We must "see the modern as inevitably contested" and "write over the given and privileged narratives of citizenship other narratives of human connections that draw sustenance from dreamt-up pasts and futures where collectivities are defined neither by the rituals of citizenship nor by the nightmare of 'tradition' that 'modernity' creates."7 Yet, at the same time, the recovery of traditions suppressed by assimilationist colonial policies is a priority for Indigenous Americans. Mark Salber Phillips's argument about the mal- leability of tradition helps to resolve this contradiction. He makes an important distinction between a reactionary tradi- tionalism and a more liberal view of traditions as continuities of engagement that "can be constituted or reconstituted on the basis of acts of rupture as well as of renewal."8 Such a view</page><page sequence="19">536 ART bulletin December 2013 volume xcv number 4 Plate 724 Sense of Self 2 Thomas, Sense of Self 2009, from Rebinding the North American Indian , Volume 21 , pigment print on archival paper, 45 X 36 in.

Robert Goldwater wrote in 1938: "since tradition matters primarily for its contrastive value, it is always modernity, not traditionality, that re- quires specific analysis" ( Primitivism in Modern Art [New York: Vintage Books, 1967], 17). Susan Stanford Friedman has reiterated the point: "Modernity and tradition are relational concepts that modernity pro- duces to cut itself off from the past, to distinguish the 'now' from the 'then.' Modernity invents tradition, suppresses its own continuities with the past, and often produces nostalgia for what has been seemingly lost" ("Periodizing Modernism: Postcolonial Modernities and the Space/Time Borders of Modernist Studies," Modernism /Modernity 13, no. 3 [Septem- ber 2006] : 434) .

Regine Prange Even if an artwork breaks with tradition, it acquires its value by successfully following and modifying an accepted tradition of art production. In the Renaissance, the reference to clas- sical antiquity legitimated the modern idea of the artist as an autonomous, creative subject, while the perceived ideal of classical sculpture demonstrated the necessity of breaking with the formula of Byzantine art. Classicism recommended the imitation of antique sculpture and architecture over the empirical study of nature. In this way, it maintained a meta- physical synthesis of individuality and divine authority, un- derpinned by a concept of universal truth. Mediated by the fine arts, this concept of universal truth was not abandoned but transformed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Promoted by the feudal lords and representing their sover- eignty, classicism was gradually appropriated and revised by a newly established academic practice located in universities and museums, themselves institutions of the liberal civic state. German authors, such as the philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling, the art historian Karl Friedrich von Rumohr, and the architect Gottfried Semper, contributed considerably to this transformative process. In effect, an anthropological and psychological "translation" of normative classicist ideals was effected to fit industrial societ- ies and their democratic structures. Absolute harmony could no longer be derived from handcrafted imitation, since the handcrafted was increasingly created by machines. Instead, and more than ever before, absolute harmony had to be explained by inner, unconscious forces of genius. The classi- cal idea of form was consequently replaced by an ideal per- ception. What Ernst Gombrich termed "the preference for the primitive"1 accompanied the epistemological shift from natura naturata , the static nucleus of classicist art theory, to natura naturans , which conceived of the artist's activity as a process of perception and production. The scholarly focus of the Viennese art historian Alois Riegl on late antiquity grew out of this context. It followed</page><page sequence="21">538 ART bulletin December 2013 volume xcv number 4 1 Emperor Justinian /, Bishop Maximinus , and Attendants , ca. 547 CE, mosaic, San Vitale, Ravenna, north wall of the apse (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Cameraphoto Arte, Venice, provided by Art Resource, NY) the Romantic réévaluation of the Middle Ages and it widely agreed with Semper's and Adolf von Hildebrand's anthropo- logical definition of art production, which viewed the making of art in relation to natural laws of perception and to social and aesthetic needs. Riegl's rehabilitation of late antiquity (which had been languishing as a period of "degeneration") was motivated by his idea of the evolutionary process of the Kunstwollen, the form- and style-producing artistic will, which moved from a primitive tactile mode of perception to an advanced, premodern, "optical" mode in which spatial values were experienced only by the mind. In his book of 1901, Spätrömische Kunstindustrie , Riegl analyzed the main features of the art and art industry of late antiquity. Between the lines, he also described the characteristics of the art contemporary to his time, namely, Impressionism and Symbolism. To align past and present as Riegl implies, the tradition of the antique had to be suited to modern aesthetics. In other words, the tradition of the antique had to emerge from the dissolution of anthropocentric rules of perspective and narration. In Spätrömische Kunstindustrie , Riegl examined nothing less than the modernist tension between illusionary space and material flatness. In order to solve this tension, he did not look at Roman reliefs, architecture, or ornament as such. Rather, he concentrated his attention on the way an artwork expresses a tactile or optical mode of seeing, and he consid- ered the movement from one mode to the other as a histor- ical schema. Riegl observed that antique art, corresponding to the tactile mode of seeing, was generally restricted to the plane and that it "strove for the representation of individual unifying shapes via a rhythmic composition on the plane."2 Without questioning this restriction to the plane, he argued that the late Roman Kunstwollen generated an abstract quality of space. Form was related to and unified in space rather than the reverse. The intensified isolation of form in space led "the hitherto neutral shapeless ground" to be elevated "to an artistic one, that is, to an individual unity of a finished pow- erful shape."3 Not surprisingly, the climax of the late antique Kunstwollen is the "emancipation of the interval, ground, and space."4 According to Riegl, figures represented directly fac- ing the spectator, as in the famous mosaics at Ravenna (Fig. 1), have separated from the plane in order to become spa- tialized. Riegl' s anachronism held true until Abstract Expression- ism and Post-painterly Abstraction. Both these styles are con- sidered the outcome of a continuous modern tradition, be- ginning with Impressionism (Fig. 2). Riegl had discovered the antique origins of Impressionism and Symbolism in the linear and coloristic rhythm of Roman art. Jackson Pollock's linear and coloristic painting Autumn Rhythm (Fig. 3) appears to conform still to Riegl's description. Pollock's promoter Clement Greenberg employed Riegl's term "opticality" to characterize an evolutionary model of art history, with the goal of the autonomy of art. Instead of representing reality, Greenberg argued, painting should represent its own essen- tial quality - flatness. In terms still appropriate to Riegl's definition of the protomodernist features of the art of late antiquity, Greenberg claimed that spatial expression is nev- ertheless obligatory: "The flatness towards which Modernist painting orients itself can never be an absolute flatness. The heightened sensitivity of the picture plane may no longer permit sculptural illusion, or trompe-VoeiU but it does and must permit optical illusion. The first mark made on a canvas destroys its literal and utter flatness."5 It is well known that Minimalism aimed at the complete negation of spatial illusion and that painting was finally aban- doned in favor of the object. The arrival of Pop art seemed to make clear, moreover, that Greenberg' s Rieglian construc- tion was a false one. Greenberg' s formalistic approach, cul-</page><page sequence="22">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: TRADITION 539 2 Max Liebermann, Judengasse in Amsterdam , 1905, oil on canvas, 1534 X 21% in. (40 X 55 cm).

Yet Riegl's message (one might call this the ideological function of his historiography) is still valid and legible: Riegl's interpretation of the late Roman art industry as a tradition of the modern autonomy of line and color - an autonomy beyond figura- tion - was the first step in the generalized appropriation of all styles and the leveling of high and low that characterize postmodern strategies of art production. Claiming the "lev- elling of ground and the individual shapes," Riegl's optical impulse foregrounds the depthlessness that Frederic Jame- son pronounces the cultural logic of late capitalism, namely, its ability to abolish the hermeneutic model of depth and the idea of the "subject as a monadlike container."6 Today, the gesture of anachronism has become a rhetorical means of citation in art itself. Its master, Jeff Koons, employs the mod- els of classicism again in his work Antiquity 3 (Fig. 4) - this time, as part of a collage painting whose hypermediated surfaces imitate the technologies of digitization.7 By combin- ing three sculptures of Venus on a flat "expressionist" paint- ing with erotic and childhood figures and toys - a woman (Gretchen Mol) posing with an inflatable pool dolphin and an inflatable monkey - Koons presents the ambition of the art historian's magisterial gaze. Its truth is evident. The ab- sence of history's depth generates the pleasures of opticality.

Alessandra Russo "The peculiarity of 'invented' traditions is that the continuity with it is largely fictitious. In short, they are responses to novel situations." The reflection proposed by Eric Hobsbawm in his introduction to The Invention of Tradition1 is a provoking point of departure to think about the invention of artistic traditions in the context of the Iberian expansion between the fifteenth and the seventeenth centuries. The novel situ- ations produced by the contact and clash between travelers, conquistadors, missionaries, naturalists, and a panoply of discrete societies in Africa, Asia, the Americas - and in Eu- rope itself - had as one of the most tangible results the creation of local canons (we could say, art histories) recog- nizable in terms of forms, materials, meanings, and uses. Missionaries, travelers, conquistadors, and collectors were the authors of these narratives that continuously fluctuate be- tween the attentive recording of the artistic customs suppos- edly shared by the people encountered in situ or read about from afar - artistic customs and ingenium in most cases taken as a sign of their rationality, hence capability of being Chris- tianized - and the praise of unique artifacts that precisely because of their uniqueness could be equated to or even surpass the most marvelous creations known at the time. Yet parallel to the ongoing effort of establishing a chart of the artistic variety of the world, new objects were continuously produced, challenging the way in which they could be de- scribed, fixed, and defined - challenging the ongoing inven- tion of local traditions.2 To think about "tradition" in terms of the invention and construction of this concept as irrigated by the novelty of historical situations opens up the possibility to critically read these narratives, such as a passage written in Macao about 1620 by the Portuguese Jesuit João Rodrigues. He arrived in Japan at the age of fifteen, in 1577, never to return to his native country. In his new homeland, he perfectly mastered the Japanese language, working as an interpreter and writing two grammars on the language. In his lifetime, Rodrigues saw the progressive consolidation of a Japanese unitary state after a long period of civil war between local daimyo , or regional</page><page sequence="24">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: TRADITION 541 1 Tseng Kwong Chi, Kamakura, Japan, 1988 , showing the Buddha, 1252, from the Expeditionary Self-Portrait Series, 1979-89, silver gelatin print, 36 X 36 in.

This political consolidation resulted in an increasing aversion of the Japanese rulers to the Christians and in Ieyasu Tokugawa's decision to definitively expel all the missionaries in 1614.3 It is precisely from his exile in Macao that Rodrigues created an idealized and yet intriguing "traditional" picture of Japan, devoting large parts of his historical treatise, written in Portuguese, to the "liberal and mechanical arts." A passage on sculpture merits to be quoted here: They are very skillful in the art of statuary and their statues, such as those of idols both of wood or cast from metal, whether big or small, are well proportioned. They have such large statues in their temples that a man stand- ing on the shoulder of one of them cannot touch its ear with his hand. The figure is seated on a proportionately large lotus flower with the legs crossed. The distance be- tween the knees is 50 spans and 32 spans from shoulder to shoulder, while the circumference of the seat that the body occupies is 150 spans. The palm of the hand is so big that it will hold a goodly number of people seated in it.

Butler Library, Columbia University, New York (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by the author) cast with such proportion and measurement, it does not look so big as it really is. They say that they could make the whole body if they had only a small piece of one finger, because they have all the measurements worked out. There are three of these statues in various parts of Japan, and in their fashion they are like the Colossus of Greece.4 Rodrigues is speaking here of the monumental Buddha stat- ues ( daibutsu ) such as those still visible today in Nara, Miyako, and Kamakura (Fig. 1). He had personally visited the bronze statue of Amida Buddha in Kamakura.5 Claiming three times in a short passage that in spite of its gigantism this Japanese statuary tradition follows the mathematical principles of pro- portion - a category also praised by the author in the part of his treatise devoted to Japanese architecture - Rodrigues metrically configures a Japanese canon while simultaneously entangling it with the classical and Renaissance principles of perfect beauty and harmony. As for the monumentality of the Buddha, the open reference to the Colossus of Rhodes recalls to his audience Pliny the Elder, who in the Naturalis historia had offered a similar anecdote on the Greek monumental statue: "Few men can clasp the thumb in their arms, and its fingers are larger than most statues. When the limbs are broken asunder vast caverns are seen yawning in the inte- • „ „ »6 nor. „ „ But in Rodrigues' s text, the reference to the Colossus serves more than a comparative purpose. In fact, Rhodes was considered part of Asia by several authors of the time,7 and it is not unreasonable to think that the Jesuit had started weav- ing a historical connection based on visual evidence, as would do some decades later another missionary of his order, fond of unveiling a common history between different parts of the world: Athanasius Kircher. In his Turris Babel (1679), the monumentality of the Colossus of Rhodes (Fig. 2) would be discussed within the canon of the Egyptian tradition. And in his Oedipus Aegyptiacus (1652-54) Kircher, relying on Portu- guese materials, would publish an engraving representing Amida Buddha as "parallel to Harpocrates" (Fig. 3), the Egyptian god adopted by the Greeks. He once again would draw attention to its monumental proportions. For several authors writing in the early modern period, and specifically in the context of the Iberian expansion, there-</page><page sequence="26">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: TRADITION 543 fore, the invention of local traditions is parallel to their intertwining in both time and space. A different approach is that of another Portuguese Jesuit missionary who preceded both Rodrigues and Kircher: Luis Fróis, who in 1585 had listed 611 differences between Europeans and the Japanese, including the following: "All of ours [the images] are propor- tioned to the human stature; Some of theirs are so big that they resemble giants."8 Nonetheless, in other passages of his texts, Fróis is also interested in a reciprocal reading and creation of Japanese and European visual "traditions," includ- ing when he speaks of the giant statuary: "[in the city of Miyako] there is a figure of Amida, to which the temple is dedicated, a statue, seated in the fashion of a Brahman ... of a very large height, completely gilded, and in no way inferior to what can be gilded in Europe."9 Like Rodrigues and Kircher, Fróis ends up simultaneously creating local specific- ity and connecting it to another tradition - as for him, he seems obsessed with a wide definition of a "European" tradition - and this, in turns, acquires its (imagined) specificity by being contrasted and interwoven with something external to it. A last word on the complexity of Rodrigues' s narrative of Japanese art as a whole: on the one hand, this can be under- stood as related to the "birth of Orientalism" in early moder- nity: a representation of Japan within a "pan-asian 'oriental system.' "10 On the other hand, it could also be paradoxically related to the mentioned process of Japanese nation-build- ing: this might explain the formation of a "protonational" canon,11 even though by a Portuguese. In this respect, Ro- drigues's Japanese "art history" runs parallel to the formation of European canons and protonationally oriented art histo- ries (Giorgio Vasari, Karel van Mander). These were mostly based on the idea of the biography of the artists;12 in Ro- drigues, on the contrary, art seems to transcend time and individual existence. It's an art in the present tense, one that can traverse time and space to become current. And tradi- tional.

The most telling case could be the feitiços , the "fetishes" considered the most "traditional" artifacts found in Guinea. Not only does the very word used to name them have a very peculiar history that, as William Pietz has brilliantly retraced, has more to do with the medieval West (where it was used as facticium to name practices and objects associated with witchcraft) than with West Africa, but its combinatory nature was in fact an aesthetic invention able to capture and transform the variety of things and materials brought by the Portuguese. What became "tra- ditionally" African was therefore the fruit of the contact with the non- African: "a novel object not proper to any prior discrete society, origi- nated in the cross-cultural spaces of the coast of West Africa during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries"; Pietz, "The Problem of Fetish," pt. 1, Res: Anthropology and Aesthetics, no. 9 (Spring 1985): 5. 3.
