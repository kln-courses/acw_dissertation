      <p>One Friday evening in February 1835, the most famous evangelical revivalist in the United States, Charles Grandison Finney, called on an audience of some three thousand listeners in New York’s Chatham Street Chapel to imagine themselves standing on the brink of Niagara Falls: <disp-quote>
            <p>As you stand upon the verge of the precipice, you behold a man lost in deep reverie, approaching its verge unconscious of his danger. He approaches nearer and nearer, until he actually lifts his foot to take the final step that shall plunge him in destruction.—At this moment you lift your warning voice above the roar of the foaming waters, and cry out, <italic>Stop</italic>. The voice pierces his ear, and breaks the charm that binds him; he turns instantly upon his heel, all pale and aghast he retires, quivering, from the verge of death.</p>
         </disp-quote> Finney used this harrowing scene to illustrate the forces at work in “the conversion of a sinner,” explaining that while God “is the agent in changing the mind,” “he is not the only agent.” The minister plays a crucial role through his words, but, most important of all, “a change of heart is the sinner’s <italic>own act</italic>.”<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>For the largely white, middle-class members of Finney’s Second Free Presbyterian Church as well as the national readership of the <italic>New-York Evangelist</italic>, the prominent evangelical weekly newspaper that first published Finney’s popular “Lectures on Revivals,” the scene at Niagara was an invitation to use a well-known image from an emerging national landscape culture to imagine more vividly the dramatic (and controversial) process of religious conversion that Finney sought to spark in his audiences. Those who visited Niagara in person might experience its sublimity in similar terms, as did an <italic>Evangelist</italic> correspondent later that year who described how her visit to the falls helped her “learn to fear and obey that wo[n]der-working God who is not less merciful to his friends than he is terrible to his enemies.” But they could also enter this spiritualized space by immersing themselves in a burgeoning industry of landscape images (fig. 1) or by paying a visit to public art exhibitions like the ones put on every spring by the National Academy of Design in New York, where no fewer than eight views of Niagara Falls were displayed during the 1830s. Over the next decade visual art increasingly became a tool for nurturing evangelical piety and morality. The <italic>Evangelist</italic> promoted exhibitions of Frederick Catherwood’s panoramas of Niagara and Jerusalem, encouraged readers to support a campaign to purchase Luman Reed’s art collection for “a public gallery of paintings” because of the “moral uses” it would provide, and even called visiting the academy’s annual exhibitions an “obligation resting upon the moral and religious community.”<sup>2</sup> For the reform-oriented Protestant evangelicalism that connected preachers like Finney, publications like the <italic>Evangelist</italic>, and the Benevolent Empire of voluntary associations devoted to causes including missions, temperance, and abolition, “visual piety” extended beyond explicitly religious images and themes to encompass a broadly moralized and sacralized art culture.<sup>3</sup>

      <p>This evangelical art culture helped fuel the rise of a new class of bourgeois art patrons and led to the purchase of one of the most iconic American landscape paintings of the nineteenth century: Thomas Cole’s <italic>View from Mount Holyoke, Northampton, Massachusetts, after a Thunderstorm—The Oxbow</italic> (frontispiece). Here again evangelicalism mediated the consumption of the landscape. While Finney brought his rapt audiences to the edge of Niagara, a colleague in New York’s evangelical free church movement, the Reverend Erskine Mason, instructed his congregation at the Bleecker Street Church in a similar form of spatial imagination. In a typical sermon he described the spiritual condition of a sinner who “resist[s] the Holy Ghost” in terms of what Mason called the “moral landscape.” As the sinner descends into “growing sinfulness” and “spiritual sleep,” even “though he may live amid scenes of spiritual beauty, and though the refreshing showers of heavenly grace may brighten and give new verdure to the moral landscape around him—there he is—a spot blasted by heaven’s fire, which can never be cultivated, a tree scathed by heaven’s lightning, ready to be cut down as fuel for the burning.” The visual and pictorial sensibility that Mason infused into his sermons at the Bleecker Street Church from 1830 until his death in 1851 intersected with the New York art world in 1836, when a prominent member of his congregation, the New York merchant and longtime American Bible Society board member Charles N. Talbot, visited the National Academy and decided to purchase <italic>The Oxbow</italic> for five hundred dollars. Riven by lightning and sunlight, life-giving rain and wrathful storm, Mason’s moral landscape uncannily evokes the painting’s celebrated clash of pictorial and meteorological elements and translates them into a cosmic drama of sin and salvation. Cole’s lone entry at the exhibition that year, <italic>The Oxbow</italic> was a “well known” “view from Mount Holyoke” that Cole considered “the finest scene I have in my sketchbook.” Although it depicted an actual site, Cole nonetheless intended the painting to be more than just a “view” in order to attract greater attention at the exhibition, explaining to his patron Luman Reed, “understanding there will be some dashing landscapes there[,] I thought I should do something that would <italic>tell a tale</italic>.”<sup>4</sup>
      </p>
      <p>The “tale” that <italic>The Oxbow</italic> and landscapes like it might have told to Talbot and thousands of other Americans swept up in the “evangelical surge” of the early nineteenth century is the subject of this essay. Understanding that tale requires a deeper engagement with evangelical culture than commentators on <italic>The Oxbow</italic> or antebellum landscape painting as a whole have attempted. More fundamentally, it requires complicating the way we think about American space itself. In the constellation of religious meaning that crystallizes around Niagara and Mount Holyoke, we glimpse what I define as “evangelical space,” a pervasive form of imagined space that emerged at the tumultuous confluence of popular visual culture, the capitalist transformation known as the Market Revolution, and the period of religious mobilization traditionally called the Second Great Awakening. Evangelical space was “produced” (to adopt the terms of the spatial theorist Henri Lefebvre) through the interaction of the “material space” of churches, art galleries, and mountaintops; the “represented space” evoked in sermons, pamphlets, Bibles, and paintings; and the “lived space” of believers who used spatial narratives such as the Christian pilgrimage through the world and the spread of Christ’s kingdom across the globe to orient their lives. To recognize landscape art as a crucial site within this layered, interactive spatial field is to unsettle an entrenched and reductive scholarly account that interprets it as a transparent manifestation of expansionist ideology and political imperialism; it is to begin to restore texture to a mode of expression that performed a much more complex and ambiguous role in mediating the tensions and contradictions that gripped evangelical culture and American culture as a whole during the period. Landscape paintings were not simply real-estate signs for the appropriation of physical land; they were immersive environments where viewers could cultivate a particular kind of self, defined by distinctive moral perceptions and imperatives, directed toward a concrete set of practices and habits, and oriented toward an overarching vision of a good society. It is within this more capacious spatial frame, which includes but exceeds the literal space of the continent, that American landscape painting assumes its most compelling and luminous cultural presence.<sup>5</sup>
      </p>
      <p>After a brief discussion of why Cole’s work is especially appropriate for studying evangelical modes of vision, this essay turns to <italic>The Oxbow</italic> as a rich case study of evangelical space. Situating the painting in the context of Cole’s exhibition record at the National Academy, contemporary accounts of Mount Holyoke, and developments in American Bible illustration, the essay reconstructs an immersive form of looking closely tied to evangelical reading practices and shows how devout viewers used the landscape to orient themselves in sacred history. The final section delves into the illustrated pamphlets of one of the period’s most prolific evangelical publishing societies to show how picturesque landscape aesthetics became a tool to guide spiritual life. In this light, the painting’s famous split composition takes on a significance that goes beyond painterly modes or the clash of wilderness and settlement. <italic>The Oxbow</italic> offers a neglected story that, though perhaps not the “tale” Cole had in mind, speaks to the intersection of popular religion, mass media, and visual culture in antebellum America.</p>
      <sec id="sc1">
         <title>Thomas Cole and the Evangelical Eye</title>
         <p>Scholars have explored revealing links between Cole’s work and evangelical culture. Alan Wallach has documented the artist’s ties to the Protestant “dissenting tradition” of emblems, Bunyanesque allegory, and other formal devices that influenced nineteenth-century evangelicals. More recently Michael Gaudio has explored Cole’s interest in revivalism in the late 1820s, and David Bjelajac has read <italic>The Oxbow</italic> itself as “an imaginative Christian allegory” that spoke to the religious and philanthropic commitments of the painting’s buyer. Indeed, as Cole catered to devout patrons including Samuel Ward, Luman Reed, and Talbot throughout his career, his personal background and intellectual temperament seem to have positioned him well to address their religious concerns through his art. Certainly Cole’s own version of the moral landscape surfaces frequently in his writings, perhaps nowhere more explicitly than in his “Essay on American Scenery” of 1835, which describes how “in gazing on the pure creations of the Almighty,” the viewer “feels a calm religious tone steal through his mind, and when he has turned to mingle with his fellow men, the chords which have been struck in that sweet communion cease not to vibrate.” While this formulation lacks the dramatic spiritual rupture that marks the landscapes Finney and Mason evoked, in the paintings themselves Cole’s romantic idiom, with its stark juxtapositions of sublime storms and waterfalls with clear skies and placid valleys (fig. 2), provides an apt visualization of what David Morgan calls the “evangelical sublime.” Nowhere is this clearer than in <italic>The Oxbow</italic>.<sup>6</sup>

         </p>
         <p>This essay locates <italic>The Oxbow</italic> at the intersection of two major thematic threads of Cole’s career that align with a tension at the heart of contemporary evangelical thought. The first is his persistent effort to visualize sacred history, from his Old Testament scenes of the late 1820s and early 1830s to his later interest in apocalyptic and millennial themes reflected in the series The Course of Empire (ca. 1834–36) and a proposed sequel to be titled The Future Course of Empire, in which he planned to depict the rise of “a <italic>Christian</italic> Civilization” filled with the “Glory, Beauty &amp; Peace” that Cole associated with “the millennium” (the one-thousand-year period of Christ’s reign on earth that many Christians believed to be prophesied in the Bible). The second thread is his allegorical portrayal of individual Protestant piety, stretching from his illustrations in 1819 for an edition of John Bunyan’s 1682 <italic>The Holy War</italic> through two versions of the hugely popular series The Voyage of Life (1839–42) to the unfinished Cross and the World series that was interrupted by Cole’s death in 1848. <italic>The Oxbow</italic> might seem an unlikely place to find such a convergence. After all, as a view it represents neither religious allegory nor a historical scene in any conventional sense. Yet part of the point here is to reveal how the landscape, even in the absence of explicit religious symbolism or artistic intent, becomes legible as a vehicle for religious and ethical meanings when restored to a cultural context that includes evangelical publishing and the religious-historical associations of particular geographic sites.<sup>7</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Cole’s beliefs and intentions, accordingly, are not the focus here. Where earlier accounts have approached <italic>The Oxbow</italic> by considering sources that directly inspired the artist’s formal choices, this essay turns to a less obvious source: the illustrated evangelical publications that flooded the nation in the years surrounding the painting’s production and reception.<sup>8</sup> The claim is not that Cole necessarily read the tracts, almanacs, and books discussed here or that they had a conscious impact on his painting but, rather, that they exerted a formative—if unquantifiable—influence on the way Talbot and other evangelicals who saw the painting at the National Academy or in Talbot’s home would have understood it. From the 1820s to the 1840s, as increasing numbers of Americans saw landscapes in art exhibitions and gift books, American Art-Union engravings and dinner plates, many more were exposed to religious publications that were full of landscape depictions and descriptions (fig. 3). Simply put, these printed sources helped teach Americans how to read the landscape. Piecing together an evangelical version of what Michael Baxandall calls “the period eye” is an admittedly speculative enterprise. The scarcity of direct evidence of the viewing practices of ordinary people requires a creative act of interpretation that combines close formal analysis of particular images, attention to the material settings of looking (Mount Holyoke as well as the exhibition gallery), and immersion in the dense system of spatial images and tropes circulating in evangelical print culture. The goal is not to achieve a definitive reading but to reconstruct a plausible one from the perspective of an ideal viewer steeped in a religious worldview shared by a large and increasing number of antebellum Americans.<sup>9</sup>

         <title>The Alpha and the Omega: <italic>The Oxbow</italic> and Sacred History</title>
         <p>
            <italic>The Oxbow</italic> depicts an elevated mountaintop of dense, storm-ravaged forest that recedes diagonally from the viewer toward the left side of the painting, where dark clouds and rain shroud the distant ridgetops. At right, the mountainside abruptly falls away to reveal a sweeping view of a pastoral valley basking in sunlight after the storm. The green valley is covered with neat, rectangular fields and pastures dotted with trees. Sheaves of harvested grain stand in some of the fields, and thin plumes of smoke rise from the chimneys of a few homes on the valley floor. From the lower right-hand corner a wide, placid river enters the picture space parallel to the mountainside and sweeps in a dramatic curve through the valley, enclosing a cultivated, balloon-shaped peninsula within its banks before disappearing behind the mountains. The middle ground recedes to meet a low, mostly wooded mountaintop in the central distance. In the right foreground a camp chair and closed umbrella sit on a rocky outcropping, and just below it, to the left, an artist in a hat and jacket stands before his easel. He has interrupted his plein air painting of the scene before him to turn toward the viewer, whom he confronts with a barely perceptible smile.</p>
         <p>With its unusual split composition, dramatic contrasts of meteorological phenomena, and enigmatic self-portrait of the artist, <italic>The Oxbow</italic> has long invited narrative readings. In one influential account, the art historian Angela Miller argues that the painting compresses the process of social development depicted serially in The Course of Empire into a single canvas in which nature itself dramatizes “the confrontation between wilderness and the colonizing energies of American agriculture at a particular moment in history.” The painting, she contends, refuses a harmonious account of the nation’s divinely ordained march across the continent in favor of one that emphasizes conflict and human “choice.” One need not interpret <italic>The Oxbow</italic> in primarily political terms nor necessarily agree with Miller’s reading of Cole’s ambivalence toward the agricultural scene on the valley floor to accept her general point that history is being figured spatially here.<sup>10</sup> The question then becomes, what sort of history is it?</p>
         <p>One way to approach that question is to consider how the painting would have appeared to a viewer familiar with Cole’s earlier work at the National Academy of Design. <italic>The Oxbow</italic> belongs to a sequence of uncommissioned landscapes Cole exhibited at the National Academy starting in 1827. These works tended to be compositions (as opposed to views) depicting themes typically drawn from the Bible—what Cole famously called “a higher style of landscape.” After exhibiting a scene from James Fenimore Cooper’s novel <italic>The Last of the Mohicans</italic> in 1827, the next year Cole offered <italic>The Garden of Eden</italic> and <italic>Expulsion from the Garden of Eden</italic> (fig. 4), followed by <italic>The Subsiding of the Waters of the Deluge</italic> in 1829, <italic>Christ and the Woman of Samaria</italic> in 1833, and <italic>Dead Abel</italic> in 1834. His decision to “try the public taste” (as Luman Reed put it) in 1836 with a work that would “<italic>tell a tale</italic>” was only the latest in a string of narrative landscapes Cole exhibited at the National Academy stretching back nearly a decade.<sup>11</sup>

            <italic>Expulsion</italic> is most similar in composition to <italic>The Oxbow</italic>. As critics have noted, the division of <italic>Expulsion</italic> between the radiant, pastoral scene of Eden on the right and the storm-engulfed, sublime, postlapsarian landscape on the left seems to anticipate the split composition of the 1836 view. Indeed, the two typically Colean anthropomorphic trees bent before the storm’s fury in the lower left foreground of <italic>The Oxbow</italic> (fig. 5) echo the blasted trees in <italic>Expulsion</italic>, which themselves seem to mimic the tiny fleeing figures of Adam and Eve in the left center of the composition as if to forecast their passage through the picture space. This visual rhyming is even clearer in the image Cole was accused of plagiarizing, John Martin’s <italic>Adam and Eve Driven Out of Paradise</italic> (fig. 6). This figural allusion, which recalls Mason’s description of the sinner as “a tree scathed by heaven’s lightning,” reinforces the parallel between the sunny valley of <italic>The Oxbow</italic> and the artist’s earlier depictions of Eden. Whether intentionally or not, Cole’s subtle compositional and iconographic transpositions link his 1836 view to an Old Testament narrative of creation, sin, and exile that he had been presenting at the National Academy for years.<sup>12</sup>

         </p>
         <p>Cole’s implicit equation of the Connecticut River Valley with Eden visualized the tendency of the prospect from Mount Holyoke to elicit pious commentary on God’s creation of the world from tourists who “found the scene fitted for the indulgence of devotional feelings, stood apart from the rest and spoke solemnly of the power and sovereignty of Him, ‘who stretched out the north over the empty place, and hung the earth upon nothing.’” The artist’s medium itself made literal the divine artistry the scene evoked for such visitors, who described the “fertile and beautiful valley of the Connecticut as painted at our feet by the hand of an inimitable Artist.” Just how reflexive the association with Eden had become by the mid-1830s is nicely suggested by an 1836 school primer whose entry for “prospect” reads, “Eden, and all the coast, in <italic>prospect</italic> lay. We had a delightful <italic>prospect</italic> from the summit of Mount Holyoke.”<sup>13</sup>
         </p>
         <p>While many visitors to Mount Holyoke compared the view before them with Eden, others scrutinized the mountaintop for evidence of history after the Fall. In 1833 the prominent geologist and Amherst College professor Edward Hitchcock refuted claims that boulders and other “diluvium” could be traced to gradual processes rather than to “a general deluge” commonly thought to be “identical with the one described in the Christian Scriptures” by pointing to the Connecticut River valley and to Mount Holyoke in particular, where “we find a very powerful diluvial agency to have been at work.” In a piece in the Northampton-based <italic>Hampshire Gazette</italic> that was reprinted in newspapers from Boston to Baltimore, Hitchcock declared: <disp-quote>
               <p>In numerous spots along the top of that mountain [Mount Holyoke] . . . the naked rock bears the strongest marks of the powerful action of water in the grooves and scratches upon its surface, some of which are several inches deep. . . . I found also many loose masses of sandstone and other rocks, many of them weighing several tons, lying upon the top of this ridge; having been brought thither upon the steep northern and western face of the mountain. I am prepared to prove that these grooves and valleys were formed, or at least greatly modified, by that powerful deluge that formerly washed from the north and northwest over every part of New England.</p>
            </disp-quote> As Rebecca Bedell notes, Cole frequently incorporated “U-shaped valleys,” “diluvial drift,” and other supposed traces of the Deluge in his landscapes—a habit displayed most explicitly in the “erratic boulders” strewn about <italic>The Subsiding of the Waters of the Deluge</italic> (fig. 7). It is not surprising, then, that just as the painter’s earlier depictions of Eden and the Expulsion uncannily resurfaced in his 1836 view, evidence of the subsiding Deluge reappeared there as well, in the row of mountaintop boulders running rightward from the foot of the trees in the foreground, down the mountainside to the rocky ledge above the river. Hence, through its deployment of weather, topography, and geology, <italic>The Oxbow</italic> recapitulates Cole’s earlier speculative biblical history paintings and in the process condenses a large swath of sacred history into a natural drama set in a contemporary landscape—a “higher style of landscape” indeed.<sup>14</sup>

         <p>Clearly, the aura of sacred history generated by the intertextual play of <italic>The Oxbow</italic> with Cole’s earlier work at the National Academy was strengthened by the cluster of biblical associations that had built up around the site itself since the early 1820s, associations that reflected a long tradition of projecting Holy Land geography on the New England landscape. That aura was bolstered by the widespread inclusion of landscape illustrations in American Bibles during the 1830s. Although Talbot’s American Bible Society opted instead for a pared-down product that could be reproduced cheaply and distributed as widely as possible, the society’s unprecedented output drove for-profit publishers to differentiate their own Bible editions through fancy bindings, elaborate editorial apparatuses, and lavish illustrations. Unlike the Bibles published by Isaiah Thomas and Mathew Carey a few decades earlier, which tended to depict well-known scenes from scripture but not the surrounding terrain, by the 1830s landscapes were featured prominently in popular American Bibles such as the richly embellished editions that the businessman John Holbrook published in Brattleboro, Vermont. This trend culminated in 1846 with the massive Harper and Brothers’ <italic>Illuminated Bible</italic>, which contains some sixteen hundred engravings. These Bibles trained readers to use landscapes as visual aids for imagining the events and places they encountered in scripture, beginning with Eden itself (fig. 8) and continuing through the history of the ancient Israelites.<sup>15</sup>

         <p>The point is not that Cole was familiar with these illustrations but, rather, that the large Bible-reading (or, more to the point, Bible-buying) public was, and that this religious print culture represents a significant element of the context in which an evangelical like Talbot would have seen <italic>The Oxbow</italic>. Members of this public who had viewed Cole’s earlier religious landscapes at the National Academy (or at least knew of the critical praise and controversy they had earned him) were even more likely to interpret the painting in biblical terms; for those familiar with the religious associations of Mount Holyoke and Northampton, it would have been almost unavoidable. At this convergence of the galleries and tourist sites people visited, the represented places they encountered in paintings, guidebooks, and Bibles, and the deeply engrained spatial narratives they used to orient and interpret their lives (in this case, a narrative of creation, sin, exile, and punishment), evangelical space begins to emerge.</p>
         <p>In particular, what materializes is a distinctive way of entering and inhabiting the picture space, a form of looking that corresponds to a Protestant theory of reading in which the text becomes a transparent medium that offers direct access to spiritual reality—access frequently expressed in terms of the immediacy of physical sight. In 1832 Jacob Abbott, the popular evangelical author of <italic>The Young Christian</italic>, promoted a version of this method of visualizing scripture. Noting that “Each reader can, if he will task his imagination, paint <italic>for himself</italic> the scenes which the Bible describes,” Abbott instructed readers to <disp-quote>
               <p>turn to the fifth chapter of the gospel according to St. Luke, and picture to yourself as vividly as possible the scene described there. Do not think of a shore in general, but conceive of some particular shore. Give it shape and form. Let it be rocky or sandy, or high or low, bordered with woods, or with hills, or with meadows. . . . Let it assume either of these forms, or any other which your fancy may portray, and which may suit the circumstances of the narrative; only let it be <italic>something distinct</italic>—clear and distinct in all its parts; so that if you had power to represent upon canvass by painting the conceptions of your mind, you might execute a perfect picture of the whole scene.</p>
            </disp-quote> Abbott next applies this visualization of scripture to an actual painting, when he describes a hushed encounter with Benjamin West’s <italic>Christ Rejected</italic> (1814) in the Boston Athenaeum: “Yes; there stood the Savior in the middle of the picture, passive and resigned, and with a countenance whose expression plainly said that his thoughts were far away. The Roman governor stood before his palace endeavoring to persuade the mob to consent to their prisoner’s release.” As Abbott lingers over the details of the composition, he becomes immersed in the events depicted there. The painting as a formal construct vanishes and becomes instead a space the viewer imaginatively enters to experience firsthand the truth of the biblical event—a stunning instance of how, in Morgan’s words, “visual piety” transforms the images believers see into “untrammeled visualizations of what they profess.” Abbott’s account reveals a reciprocal process in which evangelical reading facilitates the practice of “spiritual sight,” and physical looking becomes a method of re-reading that seeks to recapture a sense of the immediacy of scripture that has been eroded through repetition and overfamiliarity—to remedy a condition in which, as Abbott says, “we stop with merely repeating once more the words, instead of penetrating fully to the meaning beyond.”<sup>16</sup> This visual sensibility, combined with a tradition of interpreting biblical prophecy in terms of contemporary events and geography reaching back to the Puritans, meant that American landscape painting could serve as a medium through which the biblical text mingled with the lived present.</p>
         <p>A viewer attempting to apply this evangelical mode of looking-as-reading to <italic>The Oxbow</italic> might begin in that Edenic valley on the right half of the painting and follow the path of the storm leftward into the foreground wilderness to the blasted trees—driven from paradise, as it were. But here the composition pivots, mirroring the curve of the river below, as the swirling arc of the storm clouds and the slant of the tree trunks funnel the eye rightward, back down the slope and along the row of boulders (those traces of the Deluge) before finally arriving at the rock outcropping with the artist’s camp chair and umbrella, where an observant viewer might note the distinct cross formed by the legs of the chair (fig. 9). Thus, as the evangelical eye moves through the picture space the viewer retraces the path of mankind from Eden through the wilderness of the world toward the cross, and experiences spatially the typological fulfillment of the expulsion and the covenant in Christ’s Crucifixion and Resurrection. This linear visual trail through the composition might seem to clash with the cyclical dynamics scholars have seen in the painting’s swirling storm clouds and its alternation of rain and sunshine. In fact, however, the circuitous route just described reinforces rather than negates those dynamics, connecting these natural cycles to a version of sacred history that is itself fundamentally cyclical, in that it conceives of history as a departure from and a return to the divine source of being.<fig id="fg9" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         </p>
         <p>But here we encounter a problem. For having arrived at the outcropping, this process of return is decisively interrupted by the mountainside’s vertiginous drop to the river below, leaving the viewer to gaze across the valley, where, as Matthew Baigell and Allen Kaufman first observed, the name of God the “Almighty,” <italic>Shaddai</italic>, appears mysteriously emblazoned upside down in Hebrew letters on a low mountainside, while from another perspective “Noah” also seems to be written there. In addition to these figures, at least one other divine symbol appears in the landscape that has gone unmentioned: the oxbow in the river traces a giant omega (Ω), the last letter of the Greek alphabet. Its presence alongside the name of God is significant given that both are invoked in Revelation 1:8 to define the identity of God in terms of sacred history—“I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.” In addition, Jonathan Edwards famously recalled this passage in this very valley, in what would become one of the nineteenth century’s most influential accounts of millennial history, <italic>A History of the Work of Redemption</italic>.<sup>17</sup>
         </p>
         <p>As we stand in a wilderness gazing at a paradise on the other side of the omega, the painting’s abrupt compositional break between foreground and background takes on a cosmic significance that recalls Washington Allston’s use of architectural space to represent the ruptures of apocalyptic history in his biblical paintings of the 1820s. The gap between mountaintop and valley floor could be said to inscribe into the landscape what Thomas H. Luxon has described in the Puritan context as a “two-world dualistic ontology,” in which the present world is separate from the world to come, a “really real” realm that exists on a higher plane of being. This was the sort of dualism the prospect evoked for one visitor to Mount Holyoke who described how “the beauty of the plains, the grandeur of the mountain scenery, and the wide extent of the prospect dilate the mind, and fill it with delightful emotions; and then the sight of so many spires pointing to the heavens, and designating places where the living God is worshipped, and the hopes of a blissful immortality are cherished, gives solemnity to the whole feeling, and turns the thoughts to that better, that heavenly country, of which the earthly Canaan was but a type.”<sup>18</sup> When viewed in this cosmic context, the aesthetic and spatial problems we confront in Cole’s composition—Can the painter effectively unify the landscape? Can the viewer successfully bridge the gap?—become theological and ethical ones. What is the relation between this world and the next? Is a passage from the wilderness of the world to the “heavenly country” across the river possible, and, if so, how? Is it achieved primarily through a pious private journey through life to death, or through a communal effort toward a holy commonwealth? Can it be reached through human agency within history or only after an apocalyptic judgment that providentially ends history?</p>
         <p>By the time <italic>The Oxbow</italic> was exhibited in 1836, these questions and the spatial terms in which they are posed had filled the pages of evangelical publications for more than a decade. Evangelical texts inscribed a cosmic drama into the landscape and represented individual and collective participation in that drama in terms of movement through space and changes in the land itself. Illustrated tracts and almanacs tied the arrival of the millennium to the willingness of ordinary Christians to minister to distant others—a practice often described in terms of vision across the landscape. While a vivid sense of the sacred past was shared by many Christians, this intense concern for the millennial future—for what lay beyond the omega and how it could be reached—is what makes Cole’s landscape resonate so powerfully with antebellum evangelical culture.</p>
         <p>That millennial concern began, in a sense, in Northampton, where Jonathan Edwards lived and ministered for nearly twenty-five years, and where he led a series of famous revivals before being ousted by his own congregation in 1750. By the nineteenth century the Puritan divine had become one of the area’s greatest claims to fame, as demonstrated by the many accounts that identify Northampton as the home of “the celebrated President Edwards.” This association is crucial for understanding the appeal of Cole’s painting to an evangelical viewer. Although Protestant theologians had substantially revised Edwards’s Calvinism by the early nineteenth century, Edwards remained an enormous source of religious inspiration and authority for a diverse array of antebellum evangelicals. These included Mary Lyon, founder of the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, who situated her work within Edwards’s millennial framework and often preached with a copy of <italic>A History of the Work of Redemption</italic> in her hand; two of the most powerful leaders and backers of organized benevolence, the wealthy New York merchants Arthur and Lewis Tappan, who hailed from Northampton; and, of course, Charles Talbot himself, who spent his summers in Northampton and bought a home for his father there not long before purchasing <italic>The Oxbow</italic>.<sup>19</sup> Each of these luminaries was intimately familiar with the place Cole chose to depict, and they were almost certainly aware of its ties to the man who loomed so large in the religious tradition they claimed as their own. The figure of Edwards connects the painting’s retelling of biblical history to an account of sacred history that saw the ancient past flowing into the evangelical present and the millennial future through the medium of print. It is within this world of millennial print culture that <italic>The Oxbow</italic> becomes fully visible as evangelical space.</p>

         <title>The American Tract Society and the Landscape of Evangelical Publications</title>
         <p>In “Conversion of President Edwards,” a tract edition of Edwards’s influential 1739 conversion narrative that the American Tract Society (ATS) published about 1830, Alexander Anderson’s wood engraving of a man gazing out over a wooded scene (fig. 10), captioned by a passage from Edwards’s text, “I walked abroad alone, in a solitary place, for contemplation,” highlights the role of the landscape in the protagonist’s spiritual development. In the narrative, Edwards recalls that as a young man he experienced a “calm, delightful abstraction of the soul from all the concerns of this world” and imagined himself “alone in the mountains, or some solitary wilderness, far from all mankind, sweetly conversing with Christ, and rapt and swallowed up in God.” As Edwards’s piety deepens, he increasingly sees God’s presence shining through nature, as “God’s excellency, his wisdom, his purity, and love, seemed to appear in every thing; in the sun, moon, and stars; in the clouds, and blue sky; in the grass, flowers, and trees; in the water.” By the time he accepts a call to the ministry in Northampton, the text’s pattern of linking spiritual experience to the visual perception of natural scenery is firmly established, and it continues there in a way that suggestively forecasts Cole’s painting. When Edwards confesses, “Often since I lived in this town [Northampton], I have had very affecting views of my own sinfulness,” which he pictures “swallowing up all thought and imagination; like an infinite deluge, or mountains over my head,” the passage cues the reader to envision a sublime landscape that materializes Edwards’s spiritual condition. Likewise, when he declares that the Gospels “have been to my soul like green pastures” and that “the sweetest joys and delights I have experienced, have been in a direct view of the glorious things of the Gospel,” the effect is to picture Edwards gazing from the “mountains” of sin into the “green pastures” of the Gospel—to envision, in short, a moral landscape like the one evoked in Mason’s sermon and depicted in <italic>The Oxbow</italic>. Anderson’s engraving, produced nearly a century after Edwards penned his narrative, literalizes this visual sensibility using the conventions of picturesque aesthetics and demonstrates how antebellum evangelicals combined landscape imagery and mass print culture to revitalize classic religious texts and genres—in the process popularizing what David Morgan terms “a romantic version of evangelicalism.”<sup>20</sup>

         <p>In texts like “Conversion of President Edwards” and the wood engravings that accompanied them, the ATS offered nineteenth-century readers an instruction manual for using the landscape as a spiritual technology: for reading God’s presence in nature, withdrawing from the world for spiritual contemplation, reflecting on the progress of sacred history, and scrutinizing the state of their souls. Launching a massive effort to achieve national print distribution in the late 1820s, the ATS contributed a crucial component to the production of evangelical space by using landscape imagery to promote national and global evangelization and to visualize an ideal of personal piety that transcended the world and its vanity. These represented spaces and the narratives they conveyed gave evangelicals a cultural lens through which to read landscape painting as a sacred medium in which the unfolding millennium and the pilgrimage of personal holiness could be witnessed.</p>
         <p>The sense of a divine presence in nature expressed in “Conversion of President Edwards” was not exclusive to evangelicals. Similar views were held by many groups in nineteenth-century America, including liberal Christians, transcendentalists, and romantics like Cole. But Edwards’s narrative reflects a distinctly evangelical fusion of that presence with sacred history. When he describes his wont, while living in New York as a young man, “to retire into a solitary place, on the bank of Hudson’s river,” where he would often discuss with a friend “the advancement of Christ’s kingdom in the world, and the glorious things that God would accomplish for his church in the latter days,” he refers to his well-documented habit of scrutinizing current events for the signs prophesied in scripture, a practice that anticipated what antebellum Protestant theologians would term a postmillennial interpretation of sacred history. Rather than conceiving of the Second Coming as a literal, physical advent that would decisively interrupt secular time and space and inaugurate a new world, Edwards emphasized a figurative interpretation of the millennium that expected Christ’s spiritual kingdom to be achieved gradually on earth and within history through human means. Among these means were coordinated efforts to spread the Gospel through revivals, prayer meetings, and missions that would spread across the globe until, as Edwards predicted in <italic>A History of the Work of Redemption</italic>, “all the world [shall] be united in peace and love in one amiable society; all nations, in all parts, on every side of the globe, shall then be knit together in sweet harmony, all parts of God’s church assisting and promoting the knowledge and spiritual good one of another.” While the dawning of this new age could be traced in news reports and personal correspondence, Edwards’s meditations above the Hudson hint that it was also revealed in the landscape itself.<sup>21</sup>
         </p>
         <p>By the early nineteenth century, postmillennialism had emerged as the dominant form of millennial interpretation among American Protestants. Evangelicals seeking to hasten the arrival of the Kingdom adopted modern methods to carry out Christ’s injunction, “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature” (Mark 16:15). Using stereotypography, steam-powered presses, and new forms of corporate organization, the American Bible Society as well as the ATS and the American Sunday School Union produced millions of publications, culminating in what they termed “general supply” campaigns from 1829 to 1833 that aimed to place Bibles, tracts, and Sunday school books in every home in the country. As the Reverend Justin Edwards, a member of the ATS publishing committee, told delegates at the society’s first annual meeting in 1826, “These are the truths . . . stamped in bold relief on the face of Religious Tracts, and extended to every city, and town, and village, and family, and soul; by which this Society is to aid in renovating a world, and preparing a ‘multitude that no man can number,’ to shine in the beauty of holiness, and shout the triumphs of grace to everlasting ages.” The society’s faith in the power of print to create an expanding community of believers that transcended physical and social distance is vividly captured in an ATS contribution form engraved by Asher B. Durand, in which a diverse group of individuals iconographically associated with different continents, races, and faith traditions are brought together through the power of the radiant printing press in their midst (fig. 11). This centrifugal diffusion of Christian truth across the world became a favorite theme in ATS publications. In a telling indication of the continuing relevance of Edwards’s millennial eschatology to its efforts, those publications included forty thousand copies of <italic>A History of the Work of Redemption</italic>.<sup>22</sup>

         <p>Landscape imagery offered a way to condense the complex, shifting, and far-flung network of benevolent enterprises into a comprehensible vision of global evangelization. In 1822 the New-England Tract Society’s <italic>Christian Almanac</italic> captured the proselytizing impulse reflected in its many lists and statistical tables by predicting that “when all men are supplied with Bibles; when the Gospel is proclaimed from every mountain, in every valley and on every plain; when the children of every land are properly instructed; when war is ended, the prisoner liberated, and the bondman freed;—then, but not till then, will the Sabbath of rest, and peace, and righteousness, shed its heavenly light over the nations of the earth.” Abel Bowen’s wood engraving (fig. 12), which graced covers of the <italic>Almanac</italic> throughout the 1820s, visualizes this process of information diffusion and spatial compression in a manner similar to Durand’s contribution form, with a group of American Indians, African slaves, and Asians gathered at the feet of a white missionary, but here the mountainous, tropical backdrop instantly signals the geographic scope of evangelical efforts promoted within the <italic>Almanac</italic>.<sup>23</sup>

         <p>Pastoral landscape imagery became a telling verbal and visual cue for these outreach efforts. Harvest scenes printed in the <italic>Almanac</italic> from the 1820s through the 1840s (fig. 13) drew on comparisons of benevolent Christians to field laborers sowing the Gospel and reaping a harvest of souls: “‘The field is the world,’—how wide! how vast! six hundred millions, and probably more, who have never heard of the Gospel,” the 1836 <italic>Almanac</italic> declared. “If we have a great harvest to gather, we do not content ourselves with merely thinking of it occasionally—just looking at it, and then turning away. No, we thrust in the sickle, and make it our <italic>business</italic> till it is all secured. So we must do in the great harvest of nations.”<sup>24</sup> Evangelical publications paradoxically sought to expand believers’ ethical attention by gathering them into the home to read—a dynamic captured in the frontispiece to the ATS <italic>Evangelical Family Library</italic> (fig. 14), in which the landscape painting hanging on the back wall neatly suggests the spatial nature of the cognitive work being performed.<sup>25</sup>

         <p>At the culmination of this dense cluster of spatial images that represent the reciprocal expansion of evangelization and ethical awareness, the land itself indicates the dawning millennium. One tract compared the combined efforts of “Bible, and Missionary, and Education, and Tract Societies” to the tributaries of “a mighty river, destined to penetrate every moral desert, and carry fertilization to every province of our desolated world; fed with the showers of heaven, and every day flowing on with deeper and broader channel, the wilds of Arabia, the heaths of Africa, and the plains of Siberia, can oppose no effectual barrier to its influence.” Another, titled “The Benevolence of God,” likened the contemplation of God’s “scheme of redemption” to the prospect of the traveler who “leave[s] his home, and his country” and from an “enchanted spot” surveys “the long extended valley, where vegetation, in her varied forms, puts forth all her magnificence and beauty—where the burning mountain is casting up its liquid flames—or the cataract is thundering amidst the solemn stillness of deserted declivities.”<sup>26</sup> Similar to Edwards’s meditations above the Hudson River and Northampton, the incandescent character of this landscape suggests that the human community is not all that is transformed in the cosmic drama. As benevolence spreads and the Kingdom draws nearer, the ontological gap between this world and the next narrows, and the earth itself begins to glow with the divine presence.</p>
         <p>The pervasiveness of what is called here the “millennial landscape” in evangelical print culture provides a crucial context for understanding what <italic>The Oxbow</italic>’s cosmically charged prospect would have signified to an evangelical viewer. With its elevated view of a “mighty river” flowing through a glowing valley, its fields dotted with neatly harvested sheaves of wheat, and the Word literally written on the landscape, the painting gains heightened legibility alongside the system of literary and visual associations displayed in the pages of evangelical publications. As the viewer gazes simultaneously across the omega into a harmonious millennial future and into a specific valley that was well known as a touchstone of the evangelical past, the pastoral valley floor resonates strongly with a convention of using the landscape to represent missionary enterprise and millennial activism that was well established by the mid-1830s. Talbot and his associates in the American Bible Society, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, and the Bleecker Street Church were deeply embedded in this world. It is virtually certain that they were familiar with these spatial tropes and images and even contributed to their dissemination. They were devotees of the millennial landscape.</p>
         <p>Yet evangelical publications reveal another, more inward dimension to evangelical space, one that Edwards, Finney, and Mason all expressed when they used the landscape to dramatize the individual’s struggle with sin. What can be termed the “homiletic landscape” drew on a Protestant tradition of spatial narratives that Gregory S. Jackson calls “homiletic templates.” The roots of this tradition reach back to the Christian <italic>peregrinatio</italic>, the journey of faith that finds its scriptural source in the biblical account of the faithful who live as “strangers and pilgrims on the earth” and patiently await the fulfillment of God’s promises in “a better country, that is, an heavenly” one (Hebrews 11:13–16). This tradition was best known in nineteenth-century America through its Puritan-derived strain exemplified by Bunyan’s <italic>The Pilgrim’s Progress</italic> (1678). Published in numerous editions throughout the century, including in the ATS <italic>Evangelical Family Library</italic>, Bunyan’s allegory narrates the pilgrimage of its protagonist, Christian, “through the wilderness of this world,” from the “city of Destruction” to “Mount Zion.” The encounter between Christian’s small group of pilgrims and the worldly merchants of “Vanity Fair” captures the ethos at the heart of the homiletic landscape: “The men told them they were pilgrims and strangers in the world, and that they were going to their own country, which was the heavenly Jerusalem, Heb. 11:13–16; and that they had given no occasion to the men of the town, nor yet to the merchandisers, thus to abuse them, and to let them in their journey.” To attain salvation, the pilgrims must hew to the narrow “way” and constantly guard against being detained or distracted from their destination. Their unwillingness to become attached to specific places on their journey reinforces the distinction between “inward and outward” reality that Luxon identifies as a marker of “two-world ontology” in <italic>The Pilgrim’s Progress</italic>. Whereas the millennial landscape registers the ever-increasing divine presence in the world, the homiletic landscape figures the internal state of the believer in relation to a corrupt world that cannot be redeemed but only endured.<sup>27</sup>
         </p>
         <p>In addition to publishing <italic>The Pilgrim’s Progress</italic> in its entirety and in excerpts as tracts, the ATS adapted the homiletic plot to a variety of settings from the deserts of the Holy Land to steamboats and turnpikes. Landscape illustration provided a way to visualize the spatial conceit at its heart. A tract warning of “the utter vanity and insufficiency, and emptiness of this present world” showed Israelites winding their way through the landscape beneath a storm-engulfed Mount Sinai (fig. 15). Another tract, about an elderly dairyman’s effort to “learn the holy art of walking with God” amidst the “delusions of the world” after the death of his daughter, displayed on its cover a casket being carried through the landscape (fig. 16), aptly figuring the Pauline injunction to become “dead to the world” that appeared in countless evangelical devotional manuals and memoirs. In a resonant parallel with Cole’s Voyage of Life, “The Seaman’s Chart” tells readers they are “embarked in frail vessels, on the dangerous voyage of life; a voyage, which you are even now pursuing, and which will terminate, either in the Port of Heaven, or in the Gulf of Perdition.” In like manner, the tract’s cover illustration (see fig. 3) depicts a coastal landscape divided between the “Gulf of Perdition” on the left and the “Port of Heaven” on the right, a scene reminiscent of both the vertical compositional split of Cole’s <italic>Expulsion from the Garden</italic> and the elevated perspective of <italic>The Oxbow</italic>. Here the landscape narrates the individual quest for personal holiness. Visual piety converges with the traditional Protestant mode of reading that Matthew P. Brown calls “heart piety,” in which the “pious reader incorporates the text and its spiritual tenets, to the neglect of his worldly life.”<sup>28</sup>

         <p>The homiletic and millennial landscapes imply different relationships to the sacred and different forms of agency. The evangelist of the millennial landscape aims to transcend physical distance and the limits of personal experience in order to create a Christian community that spans the globe. The pilgrim of the homiletic landscape, by contrast, uses personal piety to transcend the profane world and the body, shedding them in order to experience God’s presence. Whereas the millennial landscape is infused with an incandescent sense of God’s immanence as the millennium approaches and the ontological gap between this world and the next diminishes, the homiletic landscape preserves the gap and portrays God as distant and transcendent. The two spatial imaginaries were not mutually exclusive, however. Some tracts portrays detachment from this world while others stressed evangelism, suggesting that they represented complementary moods of piety and religious practice. As Finney insisted, the individual’s conversion and subsequent growth in holiness ideally led to a life of sustained participation in organized benevolence. Even so, in ATS tracts these ideals tended to remain relatively discrete, perhaps reflecting the difficulty of integrating them in practice.</p>
         <p>Yet one visual mode gaining popularity in the United States was well suited to signify both. The panoramic sweep of many American landscape images, combined with the romantic tendency to elevate nature to an alternative form of scripture, enabled them to express the expansive scope and divinity of the millennial landscape. At the same time, the narrative potential of the picturesque trail, as well as the human figures and other pictorial elements in the images, invited viewers to imaginatively enter them and rehearse homiletic journeys. The ATS seized on this dual potential, using landscape imagery to evoke a sphere of ethical obligation and agency that stretched beyond the viewer’s immediate experience and to represent the narrative unity of the individual Christian life unfolding over time. Indeed, the conventions of the beautiful and the sublime provided a visual grammar that roughly corresponded to these spatial imaginaries, with the beautiful evoking a sense of the divine presence in nature and the pastoral harmony of the dawning millennium (as in Anderson’s engraving of Edwards and the harvest scenes in the <italic>Almanac</italic>), while the sublime captured the homiletic conception of life as a perilous journey through a hostile world (as in “The Seaman’s Chart” and “The Warning Voice”). Of course, the ATS did not always use the landscape to communicate these two ideas. Depictions of domestic interiors often appeared in tracts that deployed homiletic tropes, biblical figures like Adam and Eve or Jesus sometimes were pictured in tracts about millennialism and benevolence, and, in some cases, no illustrations were used at all. But only landscape imagery was used consistently to represent both.</p>
         <p>Landscape, then, functioned within evangelical print culture to mediate between two rhetorical modes that expressed divergent ideals of activism and piety. Scholars have indirectly related Cole’s art to each of these modes by discussing his attempts to grapple with American millennial optimism and his affinity for allegory. The religious publications that circulated around <italic>The Oxbow</italic>, though, suggest that for an evangelical viewer like Talbot, Cole’s painting would likely have spoken (even if unconsciously) to a fundamental tension at the heart of antebellum evangelical culture—what Candy Gunther Brown calls “the struggle of nineteenth-century evangelicals to balance purity with presence.” Through that lens, the sweeping course of sacred history we have traced through the picture serves as a reminder of the ongoing collective labor required to realize the universal harmony and divine presence embodied in the millennial landscape. Concurrently, the path through the wilderness toward the cross (the camp stool) and, beyond that, toward the fair country across the river, as well as the painting’s vivid depiction of the sublime natural forces that revivalists used to represent the inner drama of sin and conversion, evoke the homiletic landscape’s emphasis on personal piety and focus on the world to come. The spectacular combination of both landscapes in a single canvas is what makes <italic>The Oxbow</italic> a paradigmatic example of evangelical space. In other words, the “dramatic synthesis of the Sublime and the Beautiful” that Ellwood C. Parry III (among other commentators) has observed in the painting represents a form of cultural mediation that reached beyond the elite discourse of landscape aesthetics to encompass the concerns of ordinary people, whose ministers, newspapers, and books told them repeatedly that the landscape was a spiritual medium that conveyed vital truths about their souls and their world.<sup>29</sup>
         </p>
         <p>One might object that the interpretation this essay has advanced grants so much weight to the cultural context that it risks letting the specificity of the painting itself slip from view. As Edward Casey has pointed out, in spite of the ways <italic>The Oxbow</italic> can be made to “<italic>tell a tale</italic>,” the painting nonetheless resists narrative in important respects.<sup>30</sup> Might this essay read too much into the work and not let it speak for itself? It is a fair question, and it prompts two reflections. First, putting the matter this way perhaps draws too stark a distinction between object and context, ignoring the significant role of close formal analysis in the method outlined here. Rather than simply being a matter of reading <italic>into</italic> the picture, it is just as accurate to say that evangelical space has been read <italic>out</italic> of the picture—that it has emerged from the represented space of <italic>The Oxbow</italic> in conjunction with the spatial practices and lived spaces around it, and that it is in fact impossible to make such a clear-cut distinction between the object and the practices of patronage, exhibition, and spectatorship that produced it. If, to paraphrase W. J. T. Mitchell, we ask what <italic>The Oxbow</italic> wants, in a fundamental sense it seems to want to be a religious painting.<sup>31</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Yet at other moments <italic>The Oxbow</italic> seems to resist this identity, or at least to remain indeterminate. An astute observer might note, for instance, that the river that flows through the picture does <italic>not</italic> outline an omega, that the intervening mountainside obscures the left side of the river’s curve. Fair enough. And yet the word “Oxbow” in the painting’s title certainly emphasizes the symmetry of the bend in the river, and the site was so famous that most viewers (certainly Talbot) would have known the full shape of this geological feature. Why pretend that the painting existed independently of these forms of knowledge? As Casey argues, landscape is by definition “maximally circumambient”: it “surround[s] the human subject on all sides in an actively comprehensive way” and thus “exceeds the scope of any given perceived object.”<sup>32</sup> The circumambience of Cole’s view means there is indeed a full oxbow there behind that mountain, and the viewer knows it. To sever the painting from this network of relations among image, title, site, and so on is to postulate a reified aesthetic object that never has existed except as a construct of the modern discipline of art history.</p>
         <p>And yet—and yet. The landscape, I have argued, was a spiritual tool in antebellum America, and a good one. Like any tool, however, it was not entirely fitted to its purpose. Tools break. And when they do, thing theory tells us (following Martin Heidegger), the object that had quietly faded into the background rushes back into being in all its ontological specificity. In a thought experiment in <italic>The Principles of Psychology</italic> (1890), William James describes how turning a landscape upside down dispels our familiar sense of the painting’s “meaning” and replaces it with a new, vibrant perception of its formal properties, as “the colors grow richer and more varied” and “we feel more freshly the value of the mere tints and shadings.” Literary scholar Bill Brown argues that what he calls James’s intentional “misuse” of the painting enables a temporary disruption of our habit-encrusted perceptions of its “objecthood” and makes possible a new experience of its “thinghood.” For at least a moment, the landscape escapes the human orbit and assumes its own being.<sup>33</sup> This essay has in a sense been an effort to turn a famous painting on its head, to let it say something different. What does <italic>The Oxbow</italic> want? Not, surely, simply to be a real-estate sign. Perhaps not a spiritual-estate sign either. By probing the limits of any given reading we allow it to emerge into new life.</p>
         <p>Talbot and other evangelicals who viewed <italic>The Oxbow</italic> had been prepared by the words and pictures they saw, the places they visited, and the religious narratives they lived, to understand the painting as a meditation on millennial history and their role in it. While it is certainly true that for many Americans this history, with its typological echoes of Chosen People and Promised Land, served to legitimate a process of territorial conquest and settler colonialism, the evangelical print culture explored in this essay demonstrates that settlement was just one of many imperatives encoded in the landscape. More broadly, it suggests that we expand our sense of what constitutes religious art in America by taking into account the ways viewers might have combined religious reading with ostensibly worldly images to produce hybrid objects that flicker between the sacred and the secular. Finally, <italic>The Oxbow</italic> suggests how scholars of American culture in all its guises might benefit from thinking about space in a less literal way. As our critical gaze expands ever outward into transatlantic, hemispheric, and global geographies, we might pause to remember that space has multiple dimensions—that it is deep as well as wide. “Evangelical space” reminds us that the landscape resides not simply on the gallery wall, in the open air, on the printed page, in the heart of the believer, or in the mind of God, but in the relations produced among all of them—and that paying closer attention to that process can deepen our understanding of the familiar spaces we thought we knew.</p>
