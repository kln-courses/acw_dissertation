McCaskie It is precisely this lack of fixed reference or stable foundation that produces meaning. For to produce it does not mean to touch a sacred stone or turn the right key that will reveal the nature of things, but involves tracing out a recogniz- able shape on the extensive complexity of the possible. Our interpretations of society, culture, history and our individual lives, hopes, dreams, passions and sensations, involve attempts to confer sense rather than to discover it. For it is we -with our histories, languages, memories and constraints-who make sense. We never arrive at the bottom of things: the analysis remains open. Our construc- tions are destined to be incomplete, interminable. [Iain Chambers, Border Dialogues, London, 1990, p. 11] Nur manchmal schiebt der Vorhang der Pupille sicht lautlos auf-. Dann geht ein Bild hinein, geht durch der Glieder angespannte Stille- und hort im Herzen aut zu sein. Only sometimes the curtain of the pupil soundlessly parts-. Then an image enters, goes through the tensioned stillness of the limbs- and in the heart ceases to be. [Rainer Maria Rilke, Der Panther, 1903, trans. M. D. Herter Norton] Wode kokuroko na edi amim a, anka esono beba ofie. If mere bulk and size could be used to further greed and violence, then the elephant would have come to the haunts of men (to seize what he wanted). [R. S. Rattray, Ashanti Proverbs, Oxford, 1916, p. 60] Asante culture was situated in a prolific nature. This contained a profuse diversity of animals (mmoa: sing. aboa). Acknowledgement of the imping- ing presence of mmoa is to be found in the myriad roles assigned to them in all manner of cultural representations and artefacts (Christaller, 1879; Rattray, 1916, 1927, 1930).1 But how did the Asante order and classify animals? What assumptions informed their taxonomic register? That is to say, what questions were posed, and what burden of intentions and mean- ings was vested in their resolution? These are highly complex issues. Any attempt to investigate them must take immediate account of a basic ambiguity. On the one hand, animals were clearly phenomenologically living entities like people. The Asante projected a tangled web of resemblances on to animals, often of a predictably anthropomorphic kind. At a simplistic level of procedure such derivations embodied a basic correspondence theory. But readings of this sort were not in fact that simple, for they did not arise from finite arguments structured by comfortable syllogisms. Synthesis was not readily achieved. This was because there is a palpable sense in which</page><page sequence="2">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS the Asante construed animals as autonomous respondents. That is, they parsed the encounter as a meeting with an elusive but kindred statement that could not make itself. It is appropriate to say, perhaps, that people and animals shared a vocabulary, but were tantalisingly separated by it. Asante efforts at interrogative coaxing to elicit conversational responses were 'bridging' exercises in communication with other types of being. But such initiatives were fragile and consistently broke down on the resistant distinc- tion between subject and object.2 On the other hand, human life and animal life were categorically quite distinct. The very noun aboa was the expressive core of a cluster of gravely offensive insults that no person might properly address to another. These connoted disorder, licence, excess, indulgence and sensuality. They implied a fatal absence of that mediating control that was indispensable to the Asante definition of human status. Thus, for example, the locution aboa onipa ('the animal (called) man') carried suggestions of boorish crudeness, of uncivilised status, and of an absolute ignorance of behavioural norms and properties. In sum, apophthegmatic strictures of this sort bespoke a con- dition of animality, and underlined a clear distinction between people and animals (Fortes Mss, 'Insults . . .'; Warren and Brempong, 1977). In the seemingly contradictory light of the foregoing we may say that the Asante approached the classification of animals in two ways, or from the perspective of two sets of questions. With due caution we might distinguish these by terming them phenomenological and ontological modes of order- ing. The first was an attempt to classify animals as physical objects existing independently of Asante awareness of them, as such objects presented themselves to consciousness. The second was an effort to classify animals by exploring and elucidating types of being. The two interrogative thrusts clearly differed at the level of intention. In cognitive practice, however, there were telling degrees of interaction between them. Overlapping can be ascribed to the tendency (not, of course, confined to the Asante) to build up a multiplicity of readings rather than to favour a single explanation when confronted by the complex, the odd, and the puzzling. With due caution, it might be argued that in many areas of thinking about the world the Asante practised what could be termed a form of ontological hermeneutics. (See McCaskie, 1986a, 1989a, b, 1990a, b). That is, and simply, animal life was one body of evidence or data in the world that encouraged the Asante to intensive speculation about the nature of being. Animals to the Asante-to put the matter in formal (European) terms-constituted a body of 'data to be transformed', and thereby 're- placed by a theoretical artifact' that sought to address more general ques- tions of being. (Rosen, 1989: 168; compare Rorty, 1979, 1989; Hollinger, 1985; Thomas, 1984.)3 Animals presented a field for speculation, but-very obviously-they could not explain themselves. Ontologically, therefore, they were a tabula rasa. In consequence, the Asante could apply interpreta- tion to them in an open-ended way, in attempts to build up meanings from and about them, and to compare such readings with other areas of specula- tion. (Compare in this regard Fackenheim, 1956-57; Yovel, 1979.)4 Interpretation always privileged ontology over phenomenology. That is, the resolution to areas of phenomenological puzzlement about animals 222</page><page sequence="3">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS (what they were; why they were as they were; why there existed differences between them) could not be answered by the Asante by resort to a scientific zoology. Therefore, questions about the meaning(s) of animals were sought in an ontological dimension that tried to interpret their being, rather than in the very limited answers about specificity or classification supplied by its phenomenological counterpart. Phenomenology, after all, supplied the raw data required by ontology. But very considerable overlapping between the two spheres commonly occurred, such that it might appear at first sight that the Asante practised a form of phenomenological ontology. However, this is somewhat misleading, at least in the important sense (returned to at pp. 234-39 below) that the self or selfhood in Asante enjoyed no such distanc- ing or existential freedom of operation. The self, as we shall see, was profoundly enmeshed and mired in the constructions placed by the Asante upon their history and their culture.5 II At the phenomenological level of understanding the Asante translated their sensory observations of habitat, physicality and primary behaviour in ani- mals into a set of basic discretionary categories. The normative choices involved were relatively unexceptional, and they resulted in a rough quad- ripartite scheme. In this all animals (domestic as well as wild, but excluding all insects and some reptiles) were classified in terms of Asante perceptions of their phenomenological belonging, and so of their apposite membership, in one or another of four generic orders. This scheme proposed an ap- proximate rather than an exact ordering. Its guiding purpose was to supply a quotidian index to a bewildering mass of phenomenological data, and to refine the framework to be addressed by an ontological hermeneutics. It is reproduced in tabular form below.6 Asante animal classification: the phenomenological scheme 1. asorommoa. Animals primarily living above ground, i.e. on/in trees (der. dsoro, upper part, that which is above + mmoa), e.g. asoroboa was one generic term for monkey. 2. ntetemmoa. Animals primarily living on the ground (der. (a) tEte, foot, paw, hoof + mmoa), e.g. ateteboa was one generic term for a quadruped. 3. nsuommoa. Animals primarily (or partially?) living in water (der. nsu, water + mmoa), e.g. (n) susono (der. nsu + esono, elephant) was the hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius).7 4. ntummoa. Animals that flew in the air; bats as well as birds (der. (o) tu, to fly + mmoa), e.g. ntakarammoa (der. atakara, feather + mmoa) was the generic term for birds; bats had no feathers, but inter alia they had pronounced snouts; thus hwenakro (der. ahwene, the nose + mmoa) was one generic term for bats The arbitrary nature of this scheme created some perplexities. Even at the basic phenomenological level, certain animals were anomalous in terms of the crude indexing capacity of its parameters. This engendered unaccept- able levels of quizzical uncertainty in the Asante, such that observable 223</page><page sequence="4">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS conundrums of a phenomenological kind were submitted virtually a priori to the possible readings afforded by ontological hermeneutics. An illustration of this is to be found in Asante attitudes towards aberetwe or akyekyeretwe (Water Chevrotain, Hyemoschus aquaticus), a very small hoofed mammal akin to a deer. The Asante acknowledged its kinship or phenomenological 'brotherhood' with, for example, dtwe (Maxwell's Duiker; Cephalophus maxwelii), and with other analogous deer and antelope that were unequivocally ntetemmoa. But in fact the Water Chevrotain swims with ease and is semi-aquatic. A further striking anomaly is that, while it has no horns, the male Water Chevrotain does possess very un-deer-like protruding canines. And while it shares the vegetable diet of twe and other deer and antelope, it also eats fish, crabs, insects and dead animal flesh. Thus, if aberetwe was ateteboa, it was equivocally so, and its overall phenomenology in relation to its classificatory status was hedged about with, or qualified by, contradictory indicators. These were reformulated ontologically and possibilites were adduced from that perspective. Thus, explanations of the puzzle that was aberetwe were referenced, to take one example,from the phenomenological characteristic of its virtual invisibility to ontological explorations of quiddity in relation to this particular enigmatic feature. (Cansdale, 1970; Happold, 1973; Dorst and Dandelot, 1972; Cardinall, 1927, esp. 177-8; Kyei, n.d.)8 The technique deployed hunted for meanings within a hermeneutic arena that was circumscribed by what might best be understood, at least in a preliminary way, as the etiquette of culturally appropriate Asante res- ponse. This was a moral economy of the possible, and like every such construct it embraced the principles of unknowing as well as knowing. Thus, while it was acceptable to hunt and to trap aberetwe, there was a marked reluctance to shoot it that amounted to a prohibition. No compar- able avoidance inhibited the hunting and killing of analogous deer-like ntetemmoa that were possessed of an unproblematic phenomenological status. Their quiddity presented few challenges beyond the observable and, comfortably resident in an apposite phenomenological niche, they offered only a very truncated and unprofitable invitation to free-flowing or deep hermeneutic speculation. The insightful clues that were sought from ontological hermeneutics in clarification of problems of phenomenological status were very often ex- pressed via anthropomorphic analogies. Such translations relied heavily on weighted correspondences formulated as allegory. Thus, for instance, the Asante (and European travellers) were puzzled by apdsd or ykitadey (lit. 'hold fast'). This was Bosman's Potto (Perodicticus potto), an anomalous sloth-like tree bear that was at times ateteboa but mainly asJroboa. It is possessed of a vestigial tail, and its overall oddity led early nineteenth- century Asante to characterise it as resembling 'a small pig'. Moreover, it is nocturnal, aggressive, and screeches eerily in a 'shrill' (Bowdich, 1819), 'plaintive' (Dupuis, 1824) and redolently human way. All this disquieting uncertainty was addressed and interpreted in relation to a startling phenomenological item that opened a door into a knowing ontology. Bos- man's Potto has notably reddened (yejy) eyes, a feature in humans that the Asante associated with witchcraft (cf. ayey, wizard). A familiar byname 224</page><page sequence="5">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS reported of aposo was 'youne' (yeyy). By means of this referencing, ontological hermeneutics supplied one possible solution to a disturbingly problematic quiddity. (Bowdich, 1819; 20; Dupuis, 1824; 30; Booth, 1977; Dorst and Dandelot, 1972). In a like manner, opra (Giant Ground Pangolin, Manis gigantea), aprawa (Tree Pangolin, Manis (Phataginus) tricuspis), and aprawabene (Long Tailed Pangolin, Manis (Uromanis) tetradactyla) all presented a daunting repertory of phenomenological incertitudes beyond the obvious fact that the first was atEteboa while the other two were asdroboa. All pangolins are a seeming mass of phenomenological contradictions, and have appeared as such to peoples other than the Asante-most famously, of course, to the Lele of the Kasai (Douglas, 1966, esp. 169 ff.). Apart from a phenomenolo- gical singularity that even extends to reproductive strategies, pangolins are notable in behavioural terms. They are calmly passive, but combine this with a tenaciously resilient power rooted in great strength. The Asante latched upon this dichotomy and used it to domesticate the pangolin to an acceptable understanding. Its oddity was a dependent variable and an expressive feature of the integrity of its moral economy. The enabling link with anthropomorphic projection resided in the fact that passivity masking power mirrored crucial Asante idealisations of the construction of selfhood. The pangolin was a phenomenological embodiment and promulgation of its own meaning. As such it contrived to offer seductively encouraging parallels. Like the Asante the pangolin, once provoked, was an irresistible force.9 Hermeneutical readings might be anchored in simple parallels. Such constructs were tentative essays in ontological mystery over observable phenomena. They were pervasive. But often they were also circumscribed by an interpretative strategy that dealt in parts rather than in the whole. As is predictable, selective weighting towards significance generated clear distortions. Phenomenology had to be tilted and overloaded to carry its designated ontological burden. Thus kdtdko (Crested Porcupine, Hystrix cristata) became emblematic of the martial virtues of the Asante. This identification was derived from its quills, the phenomenological feature that supported the burden of hermeneutical address. It was promulgated as metaphor; as with the serried ranks of its defensive quills, so with the Asante soldiery-wokum apem a, apem be ba ('if you were to kill one thousand, one thousand more would come') (Rattray, 1916; 69; Allman, 1990). This focus seems to have been applied generally to porcupines. Thus apese (Brush-tailed Porcupine, Atherurus africanus) was similarly held to be both fierce and unyielding, with a reputed ability to pass through fire. The quills of its brush tail were widely used in the making of asumay (charms; amulets; protective 'medicine'). (Rattray, 1927: 15, 18.)10 Encompassing ontologies of this sort were prone to exaggeration in the interests of a more exact specificity. Thus sisi(ri) or kwabrafod (Ratel or Honey Badger, Mellivora capensis) embodied a number of enigmatic fea- tures. It is sharply colour-coded, with a white dorsal mantle and black undersides clearly differentiated from one another (see remarks on the bongo at pp. 230-32 below). It has a notably puzzling symbiotic relation- ship with the indicator or Honey Bird (Indicator indicator). It has anal 225</page><page sequence="6">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS glands that give it a very characteristic scent. It is temperamental, and immensely courageous and tenacious in relation to its moderate size; zoolo- gists have reported it as carrying out fatal attacks on the groin and genitals of eko (Buffalo or Bush Cow, Syncerus caffer beddingtoni). (Dorst and Dandelot, 1972: 106; Happold, 1973: 8-9). The Asante collapsed all the foregoing clues into one primary reading of possibility that made reference to the single privileged feature of aggressive fortitude. Thus they persisted in regarding the Ratel as being 'the strongest animal' in the bush. To the Asante, its phenomenology was distilled to the service of this sovereign ontological characteristic. Its name linked it etymologically to that of the executioner (obrafo), and so to all the respected but feared characteristics associated with that dread functionary. Weighting in the direction of ontological essence led some Asante to assert to a sceptical Bowdich (1819: 327) that the Ratel would readily 'attack every other [animal] however superior in size'. This is literally phenomenological exaggeration for onto- logical effect, and in two senses of that term." It will be apparent that the phenomenological ordering of animal life was a usable index, but little more than that unless substantiated in the onto- logical dimension. It is appropriate, in dealing with Asante ontology, to talk of a dimension rather than a scheme. Asante ontology was hermeneutic, and so little significance was attached to any critical ordering derived from distinctive phenomenological categories of form or function. Phenomenol- ogy might offer up data to ontological reading, but it did not supply a prescriptive framework that legislated or instructed the hermeneutical exercise. There was nothing comparable with systems of meaning firmly rooted in the phenomenological demarcation of criteria of exclusion or inclusion such as are found, for instance, in the laws of purity and atone- ment in the ordinances respecting animals in the Hebrew Bible (Leviticus, 11-16 and 17-27). Asante culture proposed nothing that invoked such masterful appropriation, for its ontological register was polymorphously liberated from the constraints of serving as exegesis to omniscience in the Judaic or Christian manner. (Compare Damrosch, 1987; Douglas, 1966; Neusner, 1973; Leach and Aycock, 1983, with Danquah, 1944; Groh, 1922; Asare Opoku, 1978; Rattray, 1927; see too Kristeva, 1982). Rather, Asante ontology was spatial and cognitive. It referenced a horizon of hermeneutic possibility that was boundlessly and putatively cultural instead of narrowly theological.12 Animals, therefore, were val- orised properties of a spectrum that embraced knowing and unknowing. To read them ontologically was to locate them in relation to the polarities of culture and non-culture or nature, and to asseverate the possibilities of their particular status in those terms. Of course, the elusive statement being made by animals admitted of possibility, not finality or closure. It was an idiolect that might be translatable or incomprehensible, or perhaps both at once. III All manner of evidence attests to the self-conscious gravity with which the Asante grappled with the quiddity of the relationship between the polarities 226</page><page sequence="7">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS of culture and nature. As is well known, the Asante posited an irreducible oppositional distinction between the two; this was expressed via a linked series of potent referents and formulations-human/non-human, com- munity/anarchy, settlement/forest, and the rest.13 This antagonistic polar- ity was historically grounded, in that it arose from and memorialised the transactional context of the greatest transformational alteration in all Asante experience. This radical change was the protracted insertion and consolidation- throughout the sixteenth century and into the seventeenth-of a sedentary cultural order grounded in sustainable crop agriculture and differentiated chiefship structures, in place of a shifting network of localised identities based on nomadic hunting and gathering and diffuse lineage affiliations. The huge effort involved in effecting this change is commemorated as a signal achievement in Asante tradition. And so it was. But the new dispen- sation was forged in a confrontation with nature. It had been quite literally hacked, hewed and wrested from the primary forest. And that forest con- tinued to be an ineluctable given of Asante life. Resistant, recalcitrant, anarchic, irruptively fertile, physically overbearing, and above all alien in its blank otherness, the forest as an encroaching environment stood ever ready to subvert and to annihilate the niche of cultural space. It was construed as the domain of teeming items at once unknown and inimical, a repository of potent hazards both physical and supernatural. Its rampant powers were uncontrolled, inexplicable and treacherously antagonistic to the project of culture. An unwilling host, nature enfolded culture, and the sheer inescapable fact of its presence made it the arena par excellence for the play of all of the speculative discourses of ontological hermeneutics. It was a text that simply commanded reading. (McCaskie, 1983, 1986b, 1989a, b, 1990a, b, see too Wilks, 1977, and Prempe I, 1907.) The spatial and cognitive spectrum that was bounded by the poles of -to take one indicative contrastive pair-ofie (lit. dwelling, hearth, home; syn. 'the world of the domestic'; human culture) and wura (lit. bush, grass, forest; syn. 'the world of the wild'; non-human nature) was calibrated in numerous ways and marked by a dense linguistic repertoire of referential tropes. All such usages pointed to the recognition that, if people were the cognitive locus of culture, then villages (jkuraa) and settlements of every size were the indispensable spatial forum in which culture and community were transacted. With their principal streets (abortey) punctuated by shade trees (gyan- nua), settlements and the order expressed through them were the emble- matic embodiment of dwo, a condition of physical and metaphysical 'cool- ness' and protection. This resonated with the meanings attached to human culture. The quiddity of dwo was 'white', communal, harmonious, consen- sual, abating, easing and tractable. Implicated in this were normative values that bespoke the communal integrity and emphatic order of Asante culture. This desirable human state had its antithesis in the constructions that were placed upon the non-human space of nature. The wild was the domain of 'hotness' (ahohuru). This was understood as 'red', and it was atomised, dissonant, disruptive, agitating, troubling, and intractable. It connoted very high levels of that incompleteness, fragmentation, and disorder (most 227</page><page sequence="8">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS commonly interpreted as matter out of place or 'dirt') that were understood to be anti-cultural properties inhering in dangerously unmediated powers (McCaskie, 1989a). The boundary between these two realms was kurotia (lit. the end, border or fringe of a village). This was a zone or space that was neither fully in culture nor in nature but that provided a forum for any necessary transac- tions between the two. In short, it enabled interaction between the village and the forest without compromising the identity of the former in the sedulous powers of the latter. The space of kurotia was situated at the extremity of human settlements and was marked off by symbolic fences (pampim). All those practices and items deemed to be anomalous, question- able, marginal or in any other way threatening to communal integrity and cultural order were confined to this fringe area. All that was inimical- literally and metaphorically-was ejected or managed out of culture into kurotia, and hence in the direction of its appropriate belonging in nature. The obverse also obtained. All manner of powers originating in nature first revealed themselves to culture in kurotia, and it was in that liminal space that subsequent human intercourse with them was most properly transacted (McLeod, 1981; McCaskie, 1986a). Ontological speculation concerning animals is to be understood in rela- tion to the parameters of this spatial and cognitive spectrum. Thus the Asante made an absolutely basic generic distinction between fiemmoa ('house animals', i.e. animals defined as domestic by virtue of proximity to culture) and wurammoa ('bush animals', i.e. animals defined as 'wild' by virtue of proximity to nature). The placing of animals on this spectrum reflected their spatial belonging and registered their variable degrees of consonance with the polarities encapsulated in dwo and ahohuru. Some animals, we might say, placed themselves. The quintessential fieboa, for instance, was the domestic sheep (odwan, oguay). It was literally white in colour and was inoffensively tractable. It connoted dwo, and being an exemplar of a 'white' purity and innocence it was the preferred oblation in rituals of purification. (Sarpong, 1974: 110.) Admitted into the category of fiemmoa, but in a much more ambiguous way, were scavenging animals that inhabited kurotia and imposed 'order' upon it. The ubiquitous opete (Com- mon Hooded Vulture, Necrosyrtes monachus), for example, was fieboa.14 Physically dangerous predators that inhabited the deep forest were quite unequivocally wurammoa, and especially so if they combined elusiveness with a reputation for periodic interventions in the space of culture. Such behaviour was clearly anomalous (literally 'out of place'). A notable case in point was the solitary and nocturnal dsebd (Leopard, Panthera pardus), an animal that was known sometimes to prey on humans. Thus in Kumase itself in 1892 a leopard killed two people and injured five others before it was captured. So striking was this visitation from nature in the Asante capital that the newly born Osei Kwame (later the Asantehene Osei Agye- man Prempeh II) was commemoratively nicknamed Kwame kyeretwie, 'catch the leopard' (Prempeh II, n.d.). By corollary, to take a leopard alive from nature signalled a noteworthy triumph for culture. Instructions given to this effect by the Asantehene Kwaku Dua Panin were triumphantly 228</page><page sequence="9">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS memorialised in a cotton cloth pattern that was also named kyeretwie. (Rattray, 1927; 245-6.) Reference has been made to an ontological dimension rather than a scheme, to a plurality of possible readings rather than a single true reading. The distinction is vitally important. Asante interpretative practice may best be understood as a species of ontological relativisation in which different readings were the servitors of divergent impulses and imperatives. The absence of any sustained drive to epistemic closure rendered nugatory the concept of a single true version. (McCaskie, 1986a; 1989a, b.) Ontology simply worked over the data sets, with the consequence that conflicting statements, if true, were true in different worlds. This hermeneutical strategy generated both radical dissimilarity and contingent likeness. But the multiplicity of ways of worldmaking could and did run in parallel, because the Asante agenda did not propose epistemic convergence upon a unique foundationalist truth.15 Let us return to the illustrative example of the leopard. Leopards were very clearly denizens of or beings in nature. Equally clearly, they were profoundly dangerous as phenomenological entities. One ontological read- ing of this observable physical specificity generated an understanding that leopards (and some phenomenologically analogous carnivores) always favoured the left-hand side in stalking and attacking prey. Asante hunters, in Rattray's revealing phrase, 'know [emphasis added] these animals are left-handed'. (Rattray, 1916: 62.) The Asante assigned primacy to the right hand in all the properties of human interaction and cultural discourse. The use of the left hand was associated with that which might be defined-with accurate brevity-as the practising of nature in culture.16 This particular ontological reading, then, cast leopards as a type of being that was alien to the project of culture. It is vitally important to understand, however, that this assignation of a possible reading to leopards was cashed out via discrete hermeneutical acts that addressed and that satisfied only certain sets of phenomenological conditions and ontological possibilities. This is not at all to suggest that Asante cognition took place as free association or in vacuo. But it is to reiterate the point that the premisses of Asante cultural practice dissuaded from epistemic parsimony. Hermeneutical possibility was privileged over any form of closure. Thus phenomenological and ontologi- cal candidates for adoption into the building of cultural meanings-into possible ways of worldmaking-did not have their credentials systematised to a standard measure of inclusion; they could and did come from the Asante cultural variants of 'hard study, shrewd hunches, or wild guesses'. (Goodman and Elgin, 1988:163; Goodman, 1978, 1984; cf. Tambiah, 1990: 103-5.) Of course, all this opens up huge questions about the nature of the relationship between individuation, selfhood and culture (see pp. 234-39 below). For the moment let us simply note that in forays into the ontologi- cal dimension other than the one just described the leopard was not under- stood to be an exceedingly dangerous animal. IV It is clear that the Asante devoted a great deal of thought to the perplexing 229</page><page sequence="10">PEOPLE AND ANIMAL S issue of commensurability between types of being. Observation clearly played a part in this, as we have seen, but deduction from it in alliance with discursive logical reasoning was not the methodology by which the sense of a possible understanding was produced. The Asante orientation to the world was participant rather than causal. (McCaskie, 1990b.) That is to say, the ways of Asante worldmaking privileged items of intelligibility originat- ing in the ontological dimension. The Asante, we might say, were implicated in their world(s) to a degree that constantly compromised or undermined the possibility of achieving detachment. A point of view was just that-a point of view.17 The Asante person as a type of being was first and foremost an item in and of culture and community. Indeed, the person (conceptualised as an indivisible continuum of unborn-living-ancestor) was simultaneously the vessel, the guarantor and the transmitter of culture. Individuation was a dependent property of this cultural construct. That is, free will was held to exist (albeit most often instanced as acts of deviation from communally sanctioned norms), but it was a murky concept and one that was far less explicit and important to the Asante than the ontological idea of a shaped destiny or individuated fate (nkrabea). (Wiredu, 1980; 16-21.) Thus a crucial component of a person was okra, the bearer of nkrabea. The word okra is often (mis)translated as 'soul' (perhaps to provide congruence with Christian understanding). (Williamson, 1965; 92.) But this translation is at once too rigorous and too essentialist. The Asante okra is best understood in more pliably vague ontological terms. It was simply 'explained as a spark of the Supreme Being'. (Gyekye, 1987; 85.)18 That is, it was a characteristic of the items (persons) comprising culture and community. Nothing (no thing) outside culture possessed jkra. It was unique to human personhood. This left a problem of explanatory understanding with regard to those items that were phenomenologically alive, but that were ontologically excluded from the project of Asante culture. Animals could not possess okra. Instead, all living animals (and some plants, although here phenomenology itself was at its limits) were understood to possess sasa, a component absent from people. It is most appropriate to apprehend sasa in terms of a supernatural force held to be implicit in entities that fulfilled certain conditions. First, such entities were outside culture and therefore in nature. Second, they presented themselves to observation as being physi- cally alive. Third, they were-in myriad complex ways-open (and open- ended) invitations to a puzzled interrogation of their status as types of being. Unlike okra, therefore, which was an intentional attribute emanating from divinity, sasa was (literally) a force of nature. As such it was pervasive and diffuse, and so it was alluringly fertile with clues and suggestions awaiting interpretation. Certain perspectives were encouraged by this conceptualisation. The reading of sasa-the hermeneutical act-was dedicated to providing Asante practitioners with a referential index that suggested meaning(s) within the horizon of cultural possibility. But the act itself might also throw up or reveal adventitious insights into the nature of the thoroughly alien power of which sasa was an expression. Blueprints of this latter sort gave some limited guidance as to how aspects of the power represented by sasa might 230</page><page sequence="11">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS be rendered conditionally subject to strategies of cultural management or human direction. But all such tangential essays in control-as opposed to possible meaning(s)-were acknowledged to be brittle, interstitial and incomplete, for sasa was an item that was ultimately inscribed in nature. It was susceptible to reading, but its essential nature resisted attempts at an understanding, analytical or otherwise. Metaphorically, sasa was akin to wind (mframa)-evident but evanescent, and certainly beyond capture and control. (Compare McCaskie, 1990c: 143.) Therefore the alien provenance and status of sasa were simply conceded. It might be read hermeneutically and with ontological profit, but the specificity of the power that generated the relevant clues was ultimately unknowable. That power spoke unilater- ally and could not be conduced, for its expressive content varied according to a hermetic code or grammar of its own devising.19 The Asante were not privy to the power articulated through sasa. It was profoundly ambiguous in any and all of its traffic with human culture. Its quiddity was unknown and unknowable. Thus it was held that sasa might fluctuate across a spectrum of degrees of willed autonomy, of intensity, and of hostility. In some animals sasa was weak or pliant. But in others it situated itself-and that is the apt term-as the very embodiment of alien unknowing and hazardous power. This understanding is most commonly rendered in translation as 'dangerous spirit'. What follows is a list-in no especial order-of those animals considered to be particularly 'dangerous' to the Asante in terms of their sasa. As types of being in the ontological dimension such animals combined high levels of interpretative possibility with perilous threat. In short, these are sasammoa as the quintessential embodiments of sasa as meaning and power.20 Asante animal classification: the ontological dimension (sasammoa) 1. otwe Maxwell's Duiker, Cephalophus (Guevei) maxwelli 2. adowa Royal Antelope, Neotragus pygmaeus 3. ofusuo Waterbuck, Kobus defassa 4. atrommo; saakwa; Bongo, Boocercus euryceros tenkwa 5. esono Elephant, Loxodonta africana 6. okwadu Yellow-backed Duiker, Cephalophus sylvicultrix 7. ewi Black Duiker, Cephalophus niger 8. okoo; tEte Roan Antelope, Hippotragus equinus gambianus It is impossible for scholarship (or indeed for any Asante) to make axiomatic sense of this list.21 Indeed, any such exercise would be futile, for the aggregated belonging proposed is a function of immensely complex, largely unrecoverable hermeneutical cross-readings involving an endlessly recursive dialogue between phenomenology and ontology. Efforts to extra- polate from possible ways of worldmaking to axiomatic first principles are simply wrongheaded. That which unites the miniscule Royal Antelope with the elephant within this particular ontological framework is irreducible to anything resembling a set of predicates. All that we can try to do is replicate Asante procedure. That is, we must look at sasammoa with or through 231</page><page sequence="12">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS Asante eyes, constantly bearing in mind what we understand about the paradigmatic constructs that both represented and informed Asante cul- tural practice. The Asante cultural or communal eye was anamorphic. It channelled vision into the singular point of a sasa animal in an effort to produce a series of possible insights into ontological meaning. (Compare Preziosi, 1989: 39-40, 169.) This was an exercise in confirmation rather than verification. That is, the Asante eye-the culturally informed gaze -was the sensory link that enabled the hermeneutical current to fly to and fro between phenomenology and ontology. Let us consider the most extreme case. Asante informants are agreed that the bongo antelope (dtrommo) was, as Rattray put it in the 1920s, 'the most dangerous and most feared' of all the sasammoa. (Rattray, 1927: 183; 1923: 171.) In 1817 Bowdich noted that the 'inhabitants of the eastern frontier' of Asante reported an animal called 'otrum' that had 'one very long horn on one side of the head and a short one on the other'. Bowdich's phrasing -'it is much larger than the gnoo'-is suggestive of an element of hearsay on the part of his informants. (Bowdich, 1819; 328.) This would fit, for the bongo is (and seems always to have been) relatively rare in the Asante forest. However, a much more persuasive reason for alluding to the bongo indirectly was that it enjoyed 'a certain reputation' because of the force of its sasa. (Cardinall, 1927: 153.) It was habitually and with due reticence referred to by its bynames-tenkwa, saakwa-which simply connoted an entity with a strong but vaguely unspecified reputation (for something). Very few Asante would deliberately seek out dtrommo, and even chance encounters were recalled with reluctance and euphemism.22 Unlike the leopard, there was nothing phenomenologically dangerous about the bongo. The Asante themselves knew that it was easy to stalk, for otrommo combines a certain elusiveness with highly predictable behaviour patterns. Asante hunting lore, as reported in the 1920s, characterise the bongo as 'the easiest animal of all to hunt'; it was known to herd in restricted groups of between four and twelve members; it was known to like feeding on new grass and especially on the leaves of the arum lily; it was known to favour predictable runs and to return habitually to the same salt pan or lick; it was known occasionally to browse close to villages but to be mainly nocturnal and exceedingly wary. (Cardinall, 1927: 153-4.) All these characteristics are generally confirmed by the (limited) findings of zoology. So why was dtrommo so powerful or dangerous, or rather what did the Asante see when they looked at it? The bongo is something of a giant among forest antelopes. It can reach 1-25 m in height and can weigh up to 250 kg. The male bears a set of massive lyrate horns, almost smooth and with unpigmented tips (a common visual comparison is with ivory). The female has less impressive, much more slender horns, often of an irregular shape (see the remarks of Bowdich's informants, above). But the most striking feature of the bongo is its highly distinctive coloration. Its body is a striking chestnut red, barred with twelve or more conspicuous narrow vertical white stripes on the sides. The mane is striped black and white. The head is chestnut red, with a blazoned white chevron between the eyes, two white spots on each cheek, and a white patch on the throat. The underparts are rufous giving way to black. The legs are black, with white markings. The 232</page><page sequence="13">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS tail is white, with a black tip. The bongo also seems to possess sebaceous glands that are both enlarged and diffuse. This gives the animal a most spectacular characteristic, for 'the bongo seems to "bleed" when it rains, the rain washing out a red pigment from its coat'. (Spinage, 1986: 155, 172-3; see too Dorst and Dandelot, 1972, 190-1; Happold, 1973, 37-8.) In terms of Asante culture the array of visual signifiers presented by the bongo opened into a dense matrix of ontological possibility. The animal positively resonated in crucial areas of Asante thinking and belief. It was this suggestively fertile congruence that enabled the hermeneutic to confer upon the bongo its unsurpassed reputation as the most potent of all sasam- moa. The body area of the bongo was very sharply differentiated into zones distinctively emblazoned with the three primary-and intensely symbolic -colours in Asante cognition and culture. The animal was by turns a kaleidoscopic representation in black (tuntum), white (fufu) and red (kokoo). (Compare Needham, 1985: 66.) In Asante culture black and white were unambiguous colours. Black stood for death and was expressive of regret and mourning. White was auspicious and was the emblematic sign of victory and spiritual purity. To the Asante black and white were in profound symbolic opposition. To wear both together at once was unthinkably inappropriate. It would have denoted an offensive level of cultural incoherence. But the bongo flaunted both colours in a most startling (and troubling) way. Red-the dominant back- ground pigmentation of otrommo-was not unambiguous. It was full of acutely equivocal meanings. It symbolised the life and death aspects of blood, together with that volatile mix of feelings that were identified with strongly emotive concepts like impurity, danger, sorrow, anger and defi- nance. M'ani abere ('my eyes are red', that is, bloodshot) was a common locution that signified the dangerously anarchic confusions that charac- terised that heightened emotional state which combined aggression, sorrow, rage and despair. Redness 'overwhelmed' the signal clarities of black and white, and might represent a potential subversion of the fixed norms of community and the order of culture. In this context it is highly significant to recall that the polar opposite of 'white' dwo was not black, but rather the singularly ambiguous 'red' ahohuru. Taken together, then, the bongo was transmitting a welter of highly contradictory and disquieting messages, and doing so in a way and at a level of intensity that invited the hermeneutical act to supply its possible ontological status as a type of being in relation to culture. (Hagan, 1970; McCaskie, 1990a: 51-2, forthcoming; compare Antubam, 1963; 75-86.) Ontological speculation about otrommo was further encouraged and deepened by the resonant appearance of certain of its precisely defined features. The very clear white striping on the body and the white markings on the head had eerily exact analogues in Asante cultural practice. The bongo seemed to be painted white in a manner akin to the Asante themsel- ves when they donned white clay (hyire). White clay stripes were univers- ally worn as a symbol of celebration, innocence and a state of grace. Among other things hyire was a sign of acquittal in a court case, of victory in war, and of a priest in the act of conducting a supernatural manifestation. In this particular representational characteristic the bongo structured and focused 233</page><page sequence="14">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS the hermeneutical act. But it did so to suggest one possibility of ontological resolution only to go on to subvert it. Its white stripes implied an ontologi- cal clarity that the remainder of its very equivocal coloration conspired to undercut. Simultaneously it supplied meaning and took it away, leaving behind only an (un)knowing that betokened an ultimate mystery rooted in power. The confusion of knowing and unknowing was greatly deepened by the visual evidence that the bongo appeared to bleed when in the rain. Reading this feature in Asante cultural terms was a hermeneutic exercise that resulted in a massive or even insupportable overloading of the ontological dimension. It would be otiose to rehearse the fundamental roles played by blood (mogya) in the Asante construction of community and culture. Blood -in all its many substantive forms and in every sort of context-was a touchstone of meaning(s) to the Asante. To see an animal appear to bleed involuntarily through its skin carried a wondrous freight of astonishment and fearful incertitude. It defied the order of the made world, but in such a pointedly loaded way that it engendered seismic shocks in the ontological dimension. It suggested that anything might be possible, but refused to bestow certainty on insistent conjecture. The Asante were quite unable to achieve ironic detachment from such a vitally central issue, and so they took refuge in a predictably displaced discourse. Explanation was demanded but could not be coaxed from such a mystery. No more was the mystery ready to dissolve in contingency. The ontological profile of the bongo was so high that the animal had to be defused and disseminated into that blank power that gave utterance as sasa.23 It has been noted that the list of sasammoa defies axiomatic sense. It is important to reiterate that in exploring the status of the bongo as the most dangerously powerful of the sasammoa no prescriptive agenda of ontologi- cal rules is being adduced. Ordering of that sort is neither appropriate nor feasible. We can infer the play of hermeneutical readings but we cannot supply the theorems and proofs of (non-existent) logical procedures. Many of the antelopes classified as sasammoa, for instance, are very distinctively marked and coloured (albeit not to the extreme degree seen in jtrommo). Colour coding was of profound and diverse significance in Asante culture. But we cannot take that understanding and assign to it a benchmark status in defining a category of ontological inclusiveness. To put the issue another way, we can use colour coding as an enabling device to speculate about the bongo, as the Asante did, but we cannot use it-or any other phenomeno- logical item like fleetness or elusiveness-to set down a series of proposi- tions that can define sasammoa as abstractions divorced from the her- meneutical reading of specific ways (types) of being. If we choose to say that there is a common categorical denominator, then we must see with the Asante eye. That means privileging the potent mystery of a huge unknowing above the (im)possibility of cashing out a full explanation. We can illustrate this succinctly by reviewing the ontological case of sasa in the elephant (esono). More is known about the elephant as a cultural construct than about any other beast (including the bongo) in the Asante universe. (McCaskie, 1980, 1983, 1986b, forthcoming; Wilks, 1979.) It is evident that hermeneutical address was initially focused on the sheer 234</page><page sequence="15">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS phenomenological bulk and unique physical power of the elephant. In a more detailed reading, however, it was the peripheries ofesono that generated ontological density. Above all else the relatively insignificant tail (mmra or mena) commanded the most complex discourse. In this, the mmra carried the ontological burden of being an elephant into a most elaborate series of speculations, principally revolving around the symbolic representation of the cultural fundamentals of wealth and power. In all this, and in stark contrast to the case of the bongo, a hermeneutics of colour coding played no discernible part. The elephant and the bongo were both sasammoa. But the contextual ontology of each took flight from different ways of looking for and at, and of seeing and registering, radically different things. The two animals, like all sasammoa, were united in mystery but divided in possibil- ity. The obvious epistemological questions-such as why the bongo was more powerful than the elephant-are redundant. To ask such questions imposes a reductionist fallacy of closure alien to the ontological project. In this as in other respects the Asante cultural eye was all-seeing but not all-knowing.24 v It might be argued that existing accounts concentrate on the least interest- ing intellectual aspects of the encounter between the Asante and animals. Scholarship has furnished dense ethnographies of the personnel and eti- quette of the hunt and of the elaborate funeral rites that accompanied the disposal of dead sasammoa. It also has much to say about the specialist caste of hunters. Selection and training, protective medicine and apparel, dif- ferentiated skills in the chase, hierarchies of apprenticeship and mastery, folklore and myth, prowess and comradeship, socio-economic prestige, and the rest, are all well documented facets of Asante hunting (e.g. Rattray, 1927; Kyei, n.d.; Nketia, 1963, esp. 75-89). But all this material has tended to disparate description rather than analytical rigour. It will be obvious by now, for example, that the hunting, killing and mandatory burial of sasammoa were mediated passages or deliberated stages in one specific transaction of the generalised, hazardous activity of sub- jugating items inscribed in nature to human culture. Detail and care in such a process-the prescribed intricacies of which constitute the textual bulk of ethnographic description-were at once manifest and very complex actions in an empiricist sense. But, stripped of its transactional accretions, the underlying project was both unitary and simple in its cognitive thrust. All the incumbent passages and stages-empirically framed as stylised essays in a preformative baroque-were dedicated to the constant (re)insuring of the integrity of culture and community. That this was transacted via a ritualised rehearsal of prescribed actions is of only secondary (and predict- able) interest. The overarching drive to embed and to reinforce culture and community, and to sustain terms for the willed but fragile domestication of an inimical nature in that culture, are the issues of primary intellectual interest. (McCaskie, forthcoming.) The Asante relationship with animals (and all nature) was dialogical or conversational (in however fraught a manner). So let us turn the argument 235</page><page sequence="16">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS on its head, and ask what the nature of the Asante reading of animals tells us about the cultural construction of the concepts of community and selfhood. Clearly, to reiterate, the framing vocabulary of hermeneutical reading and its ontological deployment were generated through and struc- tured by the matrix of community. Representations were cultural artefacts. By definition they were held in common. Relying for efficacy in com- munication upon agreed symbols, metaphors, analogies, other tropes and understood displacements, fields of discourse like the one reviewed here presumed a necessary basis in community. The Asante cultural eye observed through a filter of shared referents. But, having established that, it is incumbent upon us to point out that the Asante encounter with nature -where mind engaged with the world-was also individuated at its moment of contact. It was the individual who went into and confronted nature. It is true that he/she carried the shaping imprint of cultural and communal identity, but items like dtrommo impacted (first? conjointly?) on individual consciousness. A unique eye gazed and read in a staggeringly complex tandem of hermeneutical address alongside that construct which we have termed the Asante cultural eye. The cultural eye, as noted, was anamorphic, but the individual eye was not programmed to the panoptic. Rather, it was anaphoric; it gazed in an unchannelled way, building its own personal connectivities by using metonymy and metaphor, but consistently referencing cultural inputs to individual experience and ego. (Compare McCaskie, 1986a: 338-9.)25 Commentators have severally discussed the unresolved tensions in Asante life between the cultural concept of community and the in- dividuated promptings of ego in relation to ideas of selfhood. In adumbra- tion of the acute Freudian-inspired insights of Fortes, Horton has remarked that the 'situation of the individual in Ashanti society' appears to be 'complex, conflict-ridden and generally disturbing', and that childhood insecurities generated by divided parental loyalties bequeathed an equivo- cal legacy of 'restless status-seeking' in adulthood. (Horton, 1983: 67, 70; see also Lukes, 1985: 296-7.) Whether or not we choose to endorse this particular line of psychological inference, the fact remains that it engages with a genuine conundrum. This is freely acknowledged by Asante (and Akan) philosophers themselves. Thus Gyekye has argued in depth for the attainment of a subtle consensus in Asante (and Akan) society between what he himself sees as the potential for conflict between the demands of the community and the individual. Yet, in urging that social thought attempts to strike or to establish a 'balance between individualism and communalism', Gyekye sees that there is 'an enduring tension' in the values and roles invested in the person and the group respectively. (Gyekye, 1987: 154-62, esp. 161.) It is certainly the case that abiding conflicts between the injunction to conform to communal norms, values and interests-struc- tured by the historical thrust of culture, and enshrined in the jural defini- tions of a matrilineal personhood in relation to others-and the premisses and ego-inspired goals of individualism continue to be contentious issues in Asante society.26 Individualism in the Asante past was perhaps most cogently expressed as a literal flight into nature. Equally, it was arguably most deeply felt and 236</page><page sequence="17">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS articulated in the hermeneutics of an ontological speculation that was at once cultural and person-specific. The work of Fortes and Horton hints at these matters but does not really tease them out or go in pursuit of their implications. Thus Horton shrewdly observes that the Asante individual was encouraged and empowered to a fuller sense of autonomous selfhood by acts of spatial and cognitive detachment from culture. Hence 'individual inclination, striving, and achievement lend themselves very readily to conceptualization in terms of assistance from the "forces of nature"'. (Horton, 1983: 69; compare Fortes, 1959, 1969, 1970.) The Asante recog- nised this. They saw hunters and cognate sojourners in nature, such as akomfoo ('priests'), in ambivalent terms. Such people were deviant in that they practised a dangerous willed separation from culture and community, but they were admirably, even enviably, special in their cultivation and projection of an autonomous individualism and selfhood.27 We can substantiate this by simple description. Apprentice hunters (abommoroo) and most especially those acknowledged to be masters of the craft and lore of hunting (abdfoo) were accorded great if cautious respect and high prestige. This admiration for individuals who lived in nature and had traffic with the unknowing of items in it like sasammoa was tempered by a sense of distance from their elective status. Hunters prosecuted an enterprise that encompassed high levels of individual choice, action and behaviour, together with a corresponding separation from community and alienation from culture. The work they did was conducted individually or with small numbers of their peers. They disappeared into nature for long periods. They wore their clothes and hair in an antithesis of right order. Their reputation extended to areas of mysterious and hazardous know- ledge-the medicinal properties of plants, the meanings of bird flight, the ways of apprehending and interacting with sasa in animals. Attitudes towards all this disturbing individualism were summed up in the recog- nition that in voluntarily exiling themselves from community and culture Asante hunters were flirting with insanity. The common expression dbdfo damfo-a mad hunter, implying the sense of being as mad as a hunter- distilled the wider understanding of the perils of an alienated individualism that had no comfortable niche in culture, that transgressed and rejected communal norms, and that might realise itself only by removal and absence from the human. That braving such perils might also serve to define the individual and thereby instil a confident, less troubled selfhood was also grudgingly acknowledged; obomdfo dii bata sdnnam hd, 'The hunter's name (is the one) that clings to the elephant meat.' (Christaller, 1879: 25; Rattray, 1916: 99.) We can discuss the relationship between Asante culture and animals in nature, but no individual Asante bequeathed a literary record of his or her discrete hermeneutical acts or person-specific ontological speculations or musings. Thus we lack anything comparable with the ontological gloss transmuted through the ego into a private poetics in the manner of, for example, Rilke's reading of the panther (cited above).28 But we can offer insights into the Asante case from an alternative perspective. At one significant level Asante traditions, proverbs and folk tales can be read as an insistent grappling with that existential concept of power that 237</page><page sequence="18">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS makes a distinction between mastery over self and mastery over the world (ways of worldmaking). Jackson and Karp (1990: 27) have summarised the general point with apt economy: 'Worldviews which stress the ontological priority of the collectivity,' they observe, 'do not preclude the countervail- ing experience of biographical uniqueness.'29 The tortured quest for that uniqueness-for surcease from an inert mimicry of the communal image of selfhood that was reflected in the totalising mirror of cultural prescription -might be wholly pursued only beyond culture. The entire thrust of the Asante experience clearly indicated the most appropriate destination. In nature the individual could hazard more incisive ventures in agency, less penumbral essays in realising an autonomous selfhood. The encounter with animals, pared to immediacy, was experienced as a jarring shock of recog- nition and of difference. Types of being nakedly collided in that void that lay on the far side of kurotia. The hermeneutics and ontology brought to bear by the Asante participant were saturated in the vocabulary and motifs of culture, but they also ordained the situational assumption of a very exact -and exacting-individual responsibility. That this made for a fearful exercise is evident from equivocal community attitudes and reservations towards the individuals who undertook it. That it also made for a liberation into an individual identity that was largely frustrated by culture and com- munity is vouchsafed by the fact that certain persons, hunters and the rest, consistently sought it out. This was not a deviant or idiosyncratic rejection of Asante culture. Rather, it may be seen as a striving on the part of the individual ego 'to live the "found" world as though it were of his or her own making'. (Jackson and Karp, 1990: 29.) Let us consider the foregoing arguments in relation to one of the most authoritative of all Asante historical traditions. In his youth the first Asan- tehene, Osei Tutu (d. 1712 or 1717) was sent as a hostage to the Denkyi- rahene, the overlord of Kwaman (Kumase). There he purloined gold and other valuables, sought to induce the death of the Denkyirahene by magical means, and was forced to flee back to Kwaman. His uncle Obiri Yeboa, ruler of Kwaman, was appalled by Osei Tutu's transgressions, and immediately sent his miscreant nephew to seek refuge in Takyiman. Osei Tutu formed a liaison with the Takyimanhemaa. One night, when they were sleeping together, he slew and beheaded her, seized her gold and once more fled home to Kwaman. Obiri Yeboa, now exasperated, sent his nephew as a refugee to Akwamu with a stern admonition to behave in a fittingly royal manner. Thus Obiri Yeboa 'very strongly advised Osei Tutu for a better behaviour', adding that if the young man 'misconducted himself again for the third time, he would cause the destruction of Ashanti'. Osei Tutu replied 'with a trembling voice that he would behave better now'. Osei Tutu then left for Akwamu. (Prempeh II, n.d.; Prempe I, 1907.) Thus far the tradition may be read as follows. The youthful Osei Tutu is the despair of his uncle Obiri Yeboa because he has thoughtlessly, wilfully and repeatedly failed to internalise the behavioural norms deemed mandatory to human status (and appropriate to his privileged rank). But note: this recalcitrance is framed as an absence of mastery over self, for Osei Tutu is the prime instigator of the events described. His behaviour is presented as a lack of restraint, rooted in an underdeveloped and tenuous 238</page><page sequence="19">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS understanding of the parameters of individual control and responsibility. His misdemeanours are authored by weaknesses in self-knowledge. To borrow from another discourse, we might say that thus far Osei Tutu has failed to enlist his rational unconscious as a conversational partner.30 He is a miscreant, and while he might be excused (and possibly even admired) for his bold audacity, it is clear that he is expected to move to an appositely integrated selfhood and put aside such behaviour. Note something else; Osei Tutu's actions take place outside Asante culture. He travels first to the south (Denkyira), second to the north (Takyiman), and finally to the east (Akwamu). In traversing this map of the world beyond Asante Osei Tutu necessarily spends much time travelling in and through nature. It is in the course of this travelling in the wild (rather than in events that occur in any one of his three destinations) that Osei Tutu eventually gains that mastery over and knowledge of self that comprise an aptly formed individuation. It is this attainment that permits him, upon his summons home from Akwamu, to lay aside his earlier persona and author a transla- tion of his new self into the first-and model-Asantehene. His biographical uniqueness now conforms with (perfectly, in the traditional retelling) an authoritative cultural recension of ideal(ised) citizenship. In the tradition, there are two enabling devices that mediate Osei Tutu's transformation of self. The first is his interaction with nature, and most precisely his relation- ship with wild animals. The second is the person of Komfo Anokye. Anokye is an okomfo, one of those adept in trafficking with (super)natural powers, and throughout the unfolding of the tradition he variously instiga- tes and explicates agency in the service of Osei Tutu's comprehension of himself. (McCaskie, 1986a, 1990b.)31 Osei Tutu's transformation begins on his flight from Takyiman back to Kwaman. Pursued by vengeful subjects of the murdered Takyimanhemaa, he hides in the burrow of opra [Giant Ground Pangolin; see p. 223 above]. He is succoured and protected by Jpra, and ananse (a spider, a key pro- tagonist in Asante folk tales) obligingly weaves its concealing web over the entrance to the burrow. The enraged Takyiman troops seize opra, but the undetected Osei Tutu escapes to Kwaman. The dynamics of this episode are crucial. It shows the awakening in Osei Tutu of a sense of self that acknowledges mutuality and interdependence. The coda to the story rein- forces this by underlining the themes of responsibility individually in- curred and obligation similarly discharged. Thus the first son born to Osei Tutu following this episode is named Owusu Pra; Owusu in memory of Osei Tutu's father (AberenkEseehene Owusu Panin of Nyameani), and Pra in settlement of his personal obligation to opra. Taking our reading a step further, we might simply note that the naming process encompasses a reconciliation between culture and nature, structured within the absolutely individuated act of fatherhood. (Prempeh II, n.d.; Prempe I, 1907.) However, it is in the course of Osei Tutu's journey home from Akwamu to succeed the now deceased Obiri Yeboa that exegetical details accumulate in the tradition. To begin with, the transformation process is already under way (witness dpra). In Akwamu Osei Tutu, significantly, has led a blame- less life. When he leaves there for Kwaman he does so with gifts, a retinue of servants, and the blessings of the Akwamuhene. The narrative of the 239</page><page sequence="20">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS journey from Akwamu to Kwaman signifies a crucial liminal stage. Osei Tutu now has the appurtenances of an Asantehene-in-waiting (wealth, followers), but this is an inert simulacrum. The individual is required to realise the role. The tradition presents this realisation as a strengthening trial by a series of problems and ordeals. In resolving each of these in turn Osei Tutu becomes himself, and in so doing he 'becomes' the Asantehene. He leaves Akwamu clad in the unrealised or inauthentic individuation of his errant past-bereft of self-definition-but he arrives in Kwaman (Kumase) as a fully realised individual with the knowledge and capacity necessary to transact himself as cultural exemplar in the leadership of the community of the Asantemay. This transformation occurs as an episodic voyaging in nature. In this trajectory the principal protagonists of the tradition, apart from Osei Tutu, are mmoa and Komfo Anokye. In a series of episodes both of these are catalytic. They move Osei Tutu through the narrative to that moment of congruence in Kumase when in being himself he is also the Asantehene. The relevant episodes are as follows: 1. Halting at the camp of Atia Boro, a hunter, Osei Tutu and his men ask for meat. They are informed that an elephant (esono) has been trapped in a pit but is immovable. Osei Tutu removes the elephant's carcass from the pit; in one elaborated version Osei Tutu, guided by Komfo Anokye, 'jumped into the pit and with a single throw he hurled the animal out by its limb to the utter amazement of the bystanders'. (Asare, 1915.) Osei Tutu then takes possession of the elephant's tail (mmra), together with its tusks, ears, and the skin of one knee. He uses the mmra to adorn his cap. 2. Osei Tutu then encounters Atenke or Atenkwa, a very rich man, and his wife Sakyiwa(a), or Sakwa. They feed Osei Tutu and his men with a fat ram, but Atenke is so jealous of Sakyiwa(a)'s beauty that he hides her face from sight. Osei Tutu kills Atenke, takes his wife, and adds the ram's horns (adwennimey) to the lappets of his cap. 3. Travelling on, Osei Tutu now hears of a leopard (seb,), and orders his men to capture it alive (see p. 226 above). This is done. Osei Tutu then slays the leopard, adding its tail to his cap. 4. Osei Tutu now meets with akyeykyena (Hornbill, Bucerotidae spp.). It is perched in a tree, eating palm nuts (kyekyey). He kills it, and sews its head on his cap between the ram's horns. 5. Finally, Osei Tutu meets dwansay (Bushbuck, Tragelophus scriptus). It is caught in a hunter's trap by a looped thong. Osei Tutu releases the animal and puts the thong round his own neck. These episodes are densely textured and saturated in both direct and indirect clues. But, again, a possible reading must focus on overall intent and not on any chimera of axiomatic sense generated from the itemisation or analysis of empirical details. That said, it is hard to resist pointing out that at (2), for example, the rich man and his wife seem to bear recognisable variations of the bynames (tenkwa; saakwa) of the unmentionable Jtrommo. It is difficult too to abstain from making some ontological capital out of the specific animals listed. And it is tempting to interpret the release rather than 240</page><page sequence="21">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS the killing of the final animal at (5) as providing a sense of an ending in narrative terms. But let us look to basic premisses. Osei Tutu's apparel-his cap and neck-is pivotal to the unfolding continuity of the narrative, and it is promulgated as (a metaphor for) him. It is a representation of personhood. The cap itself is still a vital part of Asante royal regalia. It is placed on the head of the Asantehene-elect during the enstoolment rites, and it is a commemoration and a mnemonic of 'incidents which occurred on Osei Tutu's heroic journey from Akwamu to Kumasi'. As such, Osei Tutu's cap 'is virtually the Crown for the Kings of Ashanti'. (Kyerematen, n.d.: 25, 1966; Prempeh II, n.d.) It is named, most significantly, denkyemkye; this seems to be derived from the noun ekyew (a cap, any head cover) and the verbal root dey (to master, to overcome, to prevail; encompassing the senses of difficulty, struggle and singleminded purpose). The striving referred to is the gaining of selfhood, a necessary transformation for a man who-it should be recalled-had already been asked to succeed Obiri Yeboa prior to leaving Akwamu. When he at last entered Kumase, Osei Tutu made didactic use of den- kyEmkye . He informed the Kumasefoo that Obiri Yeboa's killer-Domaahene Adom Kusi-would be unable to save himself from just retribution even if he proved as strong as esono, as fierce as osebd, as elusive as akyeykyena, or as stubborn as a ram. This was the speech of an Asantehene, but it was also an index of personal confrontations with powers in nature. Thus, in this recitation, Osei Tutu recounted the steps by which he had changed for ever, becoming a realised and integrated individuation, to the moment when a self (him-self) addressed the Asantemay in the role and capacity of an Asantehene. Osei Tutu was then quizzed about the looped thong around his neck, the nervous Kumasefoo assuming that this unformed, peripatetic youth intended a symbol of his intention to enslave them. Osei Tutu reassured the assembly, explaining that the looped thong was to catch Adom Kusi (even if the Domaahene should prove able to run like dwansay). In a sense this is the climactic moment of the tradition. Osei Tutu here offers a conclusive public affirmation of his transformed self. (Prempeh II, n.d.) The rest-as they say-is history, for Osei Tutu is now on the brink of being fully incorporated into that discourse. As we have tried to show, animals were ideal incarnations or deeply capacious vessels that conjured forth intense ontological speculation both to explicate them and to fill them up with possible meanings. Furthermore, they presented the venturesome individual with a gauge against which he/she might seek to focus the ego and clarify its status. Animals were at once immediately familiar and deeply alien. The space or arena created by these oscillating perceptions was a formidable blankness awaiting her- meneutical intervention. Collectively and individually, the Asante had their agenda of imperatives for seeking resolutions to that blankness. Finally, it should be noted that in the act of supplying possible meanings the her- meneutic turn became reflexive and turned back in upon itself. The confer- ral of meanings changed the subject as well as the object. Here we have focused on some of the implications of this for the individual. But it also carried implications for the shifting ideological construction(s) that were placed upon and informed Asante culture. But that is a different, broader 241</page><page sequence="22">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS and very complex problem that is explored elsewhere. (McCaskie, forth- coming.) NOTES 1 Mention might also be made of Pelton (1980), Garrard (1980), Menzel (1968), Fox (1988), McLeod (1971, 1978), Cole and Ross (1977), Ross and Garrard (1983). 2 I am most grateful to K. Hart for discussion of this point. 3 Compare more generally Gadamer (1975). 4 I am aware of the immensely large Kantian background to this matter but the substance of this is extraneous to my immediate concerns here. 5 I am not using the term phenomenological ontology in the idiosyncratic but influential construction placed upon it in Sartre's Being and Nothingness (1943), subtitled An essay in phenomenological ontology. For context and discussion see Danto (1975). 6 Apart from oral information and items annotated in the text I have used-as cross-checks -Christaller et al. (1874) and Warren (1976). 7 Hippopotamus amphibius was probably rare in Asante. But it was known. See Bowdich (1819), 327. 8 Unlike East or South Africa, informative 'big game' literature on Ghana is a thin genre. Cardinal (1927) is, therefore, a valuable but rare source. Further information may be con- tained in the (unclassified) Mss assembled by the Colonial Records Project, Rhodes House, Oxford. 9 Booth (1977), p. 34 documents the killing of a leopard by opra in Sehwi, south-west of metropolitan Asante, as recently as 1955. The pangolin's tail was around the leopard's neck, 'and had obviously been the means of turning the tables on the attacker'. 10 The National Liberation Movement (NLM) in Asante in the 1950s adopted kotok3 as its emblem. Similarly, Kumase's cherished football team is called Fabulous Asante Kotoko. 1 Of course, such a procedure is common in cultures other than Asante. 12 God (the Creator, and in his many other forms) was understood to be a divinity 'withdrawn' from the world and human affairs. For the lack of determined theological speculation see McCaskie (forthcoming). 13 I am well aware of the diversity of scholarly accretions that have been attached to the terms culture/nature. My use of them here is literal or commonsensical, but with the more precise meanings I attach-spatial and cognitive-clearly spelled out. 14 I have given .pete as Necrosyrtes monachus, but this may well be overly parsimonious. The Twi word apete is generic for vulture, and zoology records a considerable range of vultures in Asante. My solution is Occamist, but does not invalidate my general point: all vultures were fiemmoa. 15 Again, I am aware of the philosophical implications of the phrase 'ways of worldmaking'. I acknowledge Goodman's coinage, following him in some respects, but have applied only that in his argument which seems to me to illuminate indigenous aspects of Asante understanding. 16 Generally compare Hertz (1960) and Needham (1973). 17 I am not suggesting here that this is to be understood formally as an analytical category or property of Asante thinking. Gyekye (1987: 85 ff.) does go on to give Dkra as 'soul'. His purpose seems to be to situate the term comparatively with reference to metaphysical systems in other cultures. This seem to me to infer an unsustainable fixity, which Gyekye himself appears to recognise as a problem of a sort (ibid., 88). His analysis is subtly thought out, but his very acknowledgement that there is room for discussion about ,kra persuades me to my own, more open, formulation. 19 Compare the discussion of the Althusserian interpellated subject in McCaskie (1990a). 20 Oral and written sources have failed to persuade me to enlarge this list, which is that provided by Rattray (1927) and since reconfirmed several times by myself. But I stand to be corrected. Since the list is ontological, adding to it would not affect the argument (although it would provide data for the reading of other specific cases). E. Goody and S. Drucker-Brown prompted me to think about the number (8) on this list in relation to numbers of Asante matriclans (mmusua kesee) and to the particular avoidances (akyiwadeE) ascribed to each. But the number of matriclans is variously given, and it has been historically adjusted (see McCas- kie, 1985). Totems (avoidances and otherwise) included items other than animals (Bowdich, 242</page><page sequence="23">PEOPLE AND ANIMALS 1819: 229-31 for the earliest discussion). And-unlike three (3) or seven (7), for example-I detect no special significance attaching to eight (8) in Asante thinking. 21 I have attempted in conversation-unsuccessfully-to secure an agreed set of first principles regarding the 'construction' of the list. 22 This form of avoidance is not to be confused with prescribed akyiwadee. 23 This should be taken as stated, and not understood to imply a willing away into (an impossible) non-existence. 2My understanding of the issues involved here has been greatly deepened by a reading of recent work in art history; I owe especial thanks to some of the insights of Ginzburg (1983, 1985), Bryson (1983) and Alpers (1983). 25 For interesting discussion of the general problem-but in an entirely different context -see Eco (1979) and Culler (1981). 26 'Restless status-seeking' is certainly one possible way of interpreting Asante political history. See McCaskie (1972, 1980) for different kinds of instances. For some contemporary account of continuing conflicts in this area see, conveniently, Okali (1983). 27 Interesting general comparisons may be gleaned from the essays in the excellent collec- tion edited by Jackson and Karp (1990). 28 At one level of understanding this lack seems to me to be one of the issues (indirectly?) addressed in Jackson (1986, 1989), but I remain aware of the hazards of second-guessing the author. 29 The long shadow of M. Mauss falls over all arguments concerning this matter. See, indicatively, Dieterlen (1973) and Carrithers et al. (1985). 30 Compare the discussion in Rorty (1991). 31 Here I am taking Komfo Anokye's existence as a literal given within the context of the tradition described. I fear that my argument (McCaskie, 1986a) that he need not have existed has been read by some as a flat assertion that he did not exist. This deduction does not necessarily follow from the proposition as formulated. REFERENCES Allman, J. M. 1990.

I am grateful for comments to E. Goody, S. Drucker-Brown, K. Hart, S. Benson and J. Iliffe. I am also grateful to my student W. Donkoh and to R. Steel for information and discussion. I was able to clarify some matters in my own mind in the course of three visits to Ghana (1988-90). I am grateful to all those who helped my understanding but, of course, I exonerate them from responsibility for my analysis. Abstract The Asante (Ashanti) are a forest-dwelling people of West Africa, now located in the Republic of Ghana. This article deals with the Asante perception of forest animals within a broad cultural and historical context. Such animals were ubiqui- tous in Asante life and thought, and the article offers an analysis of the readings -phenomenological and ontological-placed upon them. The article also explores the ways in which the constructions placed upon animals were linked to Asante understandings of selfhood and the person, and to readings of myth and history. Resume Les Asante (Ashanti) sont un peuple d'habitants de la foret d'Afrique de l'Ouest, vivant maintenant au sein de la Republique de Ghana. Cet article etudie comment les Asante percoivent les animaux de la foret dans un large contexte culturel et historique. Ces animaux etaient omnipresents dans la vie et les pens6es des Asante, et cet article offre une analyse des explications-phenomenologiques et onto- logiques-qui leur ont ete attributes. I1 est aussi examine comment les interpreta- tions sur le cas des animaux etaient liees a la comprehension des Asante de l'in- dividualite et de la personne, et aux explications du mythe et de l'histoire. 247</page></plain_text>
