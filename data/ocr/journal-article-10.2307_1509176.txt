<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW 65 (1972), 33 7-366. A PROBLEM FOR THEOLOGY: THE CONCEPT OF NATURE GORDON D. KAUFMAN HARVARD UNIVERSITY THE growing general awareness that the order of nature within which man lives is a delicate ecological balance - a balance which cannot be indiscriminately exploited by men much longer without destroying the continuing possibility of human life - has not been without repercussions among theologians. There is an increasing attentiveness to nature as a theological problem and an interest in developing theologies of ecology and conserva- tion. In addition there appears to be a growing belief that the theological focus on "history" in recent years has been extrav- agant or even entirely misplaced: it has turned attention in theology away from the natural world, which is "our real home"; it has led to a theological ignoring of the natural sciences and has thus helped to isolate theology from some of the most important and influential streams of human learning in modern culture; and it has contributed to and mightily re-enforced man's sense of self-importance and insularity, for history is pre- eminently the human story, and the "God of history" seems principally involved in transactions with men (although of course he is said to be the creator and father of all). What we need, we are told, is a "theology of nature" that will enable us to understand the orders of life and being within which we live and of which we are part, and even a "natural theology" that will illuminate for us, and teach us properly to worship, the God implicit in nature.'

It is not my purpose here either to applaud or oppose these developments. Before that can be done responsibly, another sort of task is called for. We need to examine rather closely the terms in which we are now being invited to think, so that we can use them circumspectly and precisely, and not be victimized by hidden nuances and unforeseen implications. What do we mean by "nature"? What is theologically at stake in the alleged contrast of "nature" with "history"? How is the present theological interest in the "natural" related to the long tradition of "natural theology"? Are there connotations of the concept of nature which make its theological employment questionable or even risky? These are immensely complicated issues, and I cannot claim more here than to scratch their surface. What I shall attempt in this paper is to get clearer the structure, connections, and implications of the concept of nature as these bear on its theological employment. I shall not attempt to reconstruct the concept or to propose ways of redefining it so as to meet some of the issues which it raises for theology. This is partly because I am not clear about what kind of reconstruction is required, partly because I am dubious that arbitrary redefinitions can alter of Crisis (New York: Nelson, 197o); Christians and the Good Earth (Alexandria, Va.: Faith-Man-Nature Group, 1968?); This Little Planet, ed.

I hope this attempt at clarification and unpacking of some of these tendencies and tensions will help facilitate some measure of sophistication in what is bound to be an increasing theological interest in and use of the concept of nature in coming years. I Our terms "nature" and "natural" bear exceedingly complex structures of meaning. The Oxford English Dictionary lists eighteen distinct meanings for "natural" and fifteen for "nature." Moreover, in addition to their many common uses these terms have played important technical roles in philosophical and theo- logical reflection and, in certain phrases and combinations, bear whole traditions of meaning and interpretation within themselves, e.g., "natural law" (two kinds: scientific and moral), "nature and grace," "nature and supernature," "natura naturans and natura naturata," "the natural man and the spiritual man." The English word "nature," derived from the Latin natura (Greek: physis) from whence it gains many of its complex meanings and uses, originally meant birth or origin, parentage, original stock.2 The inborn or inherent qualities or characteristics of a person or thing were thus "natural" to it (as opposed to artificially added to it or imposed upon it); these, taken to be its essential qualities or properties, came to be called its "nature," i.e., what was "native" to it. An object's or a person's nature was thus that which constituted it or him as that particular (kind of) object or person, appearing and behaving as it (he) does, having just those qualities and characteristics. Eventually, especially in philosophical reflection, the concept was generalized to refer to the totality of powers and processes of the world (especially the material world) conceived as a unified system and sometimes personified as female.

I hope what I have said gives a sufficient sense of the complexity of meanings here, so that we can turn directly to the question of the theological usefulness of the term. II It will not be possible in this paper to examine all uses and meanings of the term "nature" which are, or have been, of theological importance. I shall confine myself to one focus or configuration of meaning(s) which seems to me to be at the heart of the growing current interest. This is the use of the term in such phrases as the "order of nature" or "the natural world,"</page><page sequence="5">CONCEPT OF NATURE 341 where the intention appears to be, on the one hand, to refer to the totality of processes and powers that make up the universe and, on the other, to suggest that which exists independently of all human artifice--it being both the context within which human activities are carried out and the source of raw material which human historical work transforms into culture. It will be evident at once that this use of the term is ambiguous. For how is man, and all that is distinctively human, understood here? Is man a part of nature or over against nature? On the one side, so far as nature is held to include all powers and processes in the world, man would seem to be included within nature. Certainly the material and vital dimensions of his being are directly rooted in natural processes and must be regarded as natural. Moreover, since his mental and spiritual existence is inextricably interlocked with his physical and organic being, it is difficult to see why it should not also be regarded as part of nature in this wide and all-inclusive sense. To see man in this way as fundamentally and perhaps totally a part of nature is the direction in which we are being pushed by many currents in contemporary science and culture. Human existence is a moment in a complex ecological balance without which it could not exist and to which it contributes. This ecological system is the pre- supposition of every dimension of our life, it is the context within which human life and culture becomes a possibility, and it is, in a real sense, the source and basis of our existence. This natural order, then, is the most fundamental reality (apart from God - if it is not itself to be viewed as the only viable referent for the word "God") with which we have to do. But there is a problem here. We are being admonished to take this natural order more seriously than we have in the past, to recognize that since it is the indispensable context and basis of our life, we dare not upset the balance but must maintain it with great circumspection. Moreover, we are being told that in our attempts to gain technological mastery of our world and of the ills that afflict humankind, we may have already so polluted our environment and upset the delicate balances which sustain life here on earth as to be destroying ourselves. We must control the population explosion; we must clean up our rivers and atmo-</page><page sequence="6">342 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW sphere; we must stop the kind of economic and technological expansion that uses up natural resources at exponentially grow- ing rates; we must stop using "artificial" insecticides and fertil- izers, which have unknown disastrous long-term effects, and return to "natural" procedures; we must protect those species of life now in danger of extinction; we must set aside and pre- serve those few remaining pieces of "natural" wilderness and not allow them to be in any way marred by roads, power plants, transmission lines, and the like; in short, we must stop our wanton destruction of nature. All such admonitions and injunc- tions, of course, imply, first, that men have done much to and with the order of nature and, second, that they can do something now to help restore the balance which in their ignorance and rapacity they have disrupted. That is, they imply that man is not, after all, simply a part of nature, one more function of the processes and powers that make up the natural world, but that he stands in some sense apart from all these and can and does work on them and transform them. It is through human artifice, human culture, that the present ecological crisis has been brought upon us, and (it is hoped) through a further and more sophisti- cated application of that same artifice the crisis may eventually be abated. Insofar as "nature" here is viewed as distinct from the "artificial" activities of men which modify it and use it for raw material in the creation of culture, it is obvious that nature cannot be understood simply as that system which includes all powers and processes in the universe. Nature and culture are set over against each other in polar relation, and man is somehow in both, as both are in men. This ambiguity in the concept of nature --nature as the totality of all processes and beings, and nature as polar counter- part to culture - cannot be dissolved simply by deciding to use the term "nature" in only one of these two ways, reserving some other term for the other concept; nor can it be clarified much by designating one of the two meanings as "nature1" and the other as "nature2." For the problem does not arise out of a simple confusion in our linguistic usage which a new notation can rectify. It is rather in the complexity of the thing itself, that which we are trying to designate with our word "nature," and</page><page sequence="7">CONCEPT OF NATURE 343 the difficulty of specifying how that other very complex reality, man, is to be related to it. For in a very real sense man is a natural being, is a part of nature and sustained by it, and cannot be conceived apart from the natural order in which he is en- sconced; and yet man is able to distance himself from nature sufficiently to conceive it as something over against him which he perceives and on which he can work, which he transforms through his activity into the "artificial" or "unnatural" reality which we call "culture." Nature, that is to say, is not simply an objective system of processes and powers; it is a system sufficiently complex that some of the processes and powers within it can come to self-conscious and deliberate activity which is then directed toward transforming the otherwise (apparently) un- conscious order of nature toward the realization of their own ends. Nature appears to be a nonteleological, nonaxiological order within which emerges purposive and valuing activity. Nature is a material order3 which gives birth to life and ultimately spirit, and within which these have their "natural" home. We may be able to bring out some of the complexities of our concept of nature by comparing it with a related notion, world. It may be thought that inasmuch as "nature" refers to the totality of all powers and processes, it functions essentially like the notion of world. This latter concept serves as an ordering principle or "regulative idea" (Kant) by means of which we bring all the individual and particular objects and events of experience into relation with each other within a unified whole. World is never an object of perception or of experience: it can never "come into view" or be in any way directly experienced. It is, rather, the backdrop against which or context within which we have all our experience and within which we know ourselves to be situated. 'For as long as the term "nature" has been used with cosmic scope and reference, it has been more closely identified with the material universe than with the spiritual. In consequence "naturalism," which in its more recent formulations has attempted to do full justice to the "spiritual" side of man's "nature" - thus directly employing the ambiguity in the concept with which we are here concerned - was often in earlier versions basically materialism. For discussion of these points see A. C. DANTO, Naturalism, Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ed. Paul Edwards (New York: Macmillan and Free Press, 1967), Vol. 5, 448-50); also Y. H. KRIKORIAN, Naturalism and the Human Spirit (New York: Columbia University Press, 1944).</page><page sequence="8">344 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW If we treat the concept of world as fundamentally like other concepts which refer to or represent objects (identifiable in ex- perience), we get into insoluble antinomies. This is not only because, as Kant held, of the impossibility of conceiving clearly, not to say experiencing, spatial and temporal absolute limits. It is also because the world includes within itself all space and time (as its abstract structure), and thus all events occur within the world. But it is obvious that not all events are occurring simul- taneously: some have occurred and are over with; some are yet to come. The world, then, which includes them all within itself never "exists" as world; only certain features of the world exist at any one time. Thus, it is not merely that we never do in fact perceive or experience the world as an object: in principle that would be impossible, for "world" is a concept for which no object (in that sense) exists (at any one time) at all. The notion of world is a construct created by the human imagination as a heuristic device to make possible the ordering and relating of all our other concepts of objects and events. It is thus indispens- able to our thinking and even to the orderliness of our experience - and in every culture we find some sort of (often mythical) notions of this widest context within which human life transpires - but it is itself not an object of experience; it is a fundamental presupposition of experience. The concept "nature" in many respects functions like the concept "world." It can stand, as we have seen, for the totality of all events and objects, the whole within which all fall and of which they are part. In this aspect nature is no more perceivable than the world: it is a construct of the mind. But nature is concrete in a way that world is not. Whereas "world" refers simply to the totality, the whole, and thus to nothing directly experienceable, "nature" refers in addition to particular dimen- sions or qualities within the whole, to structures and events which can be perceived and experienced. We would never say a tree is "worldly," but there are no problems at all in regarding it as "natural"; whereas to speak of "laws of the world" (i.e., of the cosmos) sounds exceedingly abstract and obscure, by "laws of nature" we designate everyday experienceable regularities in, for example, light, sound, and gravitation; for one to wish to im-</page><page sequence="9">CONCEPT OF NATURE 345 merse himself in nature seems comprehensible enough, but what would it be to immerse oneself in the world? The relative con- creteness which the concept of nature betrays in such expressions, in contrast with the concept of world, derives from the ambiguity we previously noted in it: "nature" refers not only to the totality but also, in contrast with "culture" or the "artificial," to certain features or qualities within the world, namely, to that which exists and functions independently of human contrivance or interference, that which is other than the human, over against the human, sharply distinct from culture. Thus, although nature (like the world) is the overall context within which all that we are and experience has its being, it has an immediacy and ex- periential concreteness for us which the world does not and cannot have. Nature is experienceable as well as conceivable; world is only a concept. It is for this reason, perhaps, that nature can be regarded as the source and ground of all being and life ("Mother Nature") in a way hardly imaginable for the world. And so nature can come to have a kind of religious meaning and become the object of religious devotion - and a direct rival to God - in a way not possible for the world. We can now draw together some of the threads of this discus- sion. The concept of nature, as it functions in much con- temporary discussion, appears to draw its meaning from two rather distinct roots: on the one hand there is the experience of that which is "natural" as contrasted with that made by human contrivance, the wilderness over against the city, plant and animal life in contrast with human culture; on the other hand there is the totality of all powers and processes conceived as a systematic whole. Nature is both of these: it is the totality viewed as "natural process" (not artifice); it is the widest context of human life, and thus man's most fundamental home, viewed as wilderness ("untouched by human hand") rather than on some analogy or image drawn from the teleological and meaning-filled orders of society and culture. In this respect the concept of nature raises very difficult theological issues. For it proposes a conception of the overall context for human life which does not have built into it the</page><page sequence="10">346 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW dimensions of purpose, value, and meaning,4 all of which con- cepts are drawn from man's experience of linguistic and cultural institutions and activity. The notion of God, on the other hand, as an agent characterized by freedom and purposiveness and love, is based on the model of human freedom and agency as ex- perienced within society and culture. It was possible to relate these two --nature and God --by means of the concept of creation, as long as the world was viewed as a finite order brought into being by the infinite God and destined to serve his purposes. 'Here the modern concept of nature differs substantially from classical views, particularly Greek. In the classical period nature, the context of human life, was understood as a teleological order within which man's life - and also his purposes - were meaningfully situated (see C. J. GLACKEN, Traces on the Rhodian Shore: Nature and Culture in Western Thought from Ancient Times to the End of the Eighteenth Century [Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967], chs. 1-3). Nature, even the earth itself, was viewed as a living organism of which man was a functioning part. However, as man has come to be understood (in the West) as essentially a personal and purposive being, able to envision and create whole worlds within which to live, nature has progressively lost its intrinsic teleology and become impersonal and dead. Perhaps the historical intervention of the Christian doctrine of creation is partly responsible here, for in the Christian perspective nature became viewed not as ordered by her own immanent vital principles, but as an artifact from the hand of God, given such order and direction as he extrinsically imposed. In this scheme purposiveness is lodged in the Creator, not in nature itself. And therefore it is in relation to his Creator that man's purposiveness finds a meaningful metaphysical ground, not in relation to the world of nature taken in and by itself. It is this naked and impersonal nature, now, that is the "natural order" studied by science and taken for granted in most of our experience and life. The development here is similar to that which occurred with the Cartesian dualism of mind and matter (and is not unrelated). Once mind (purpose) was wholly abstracted from matter, it was no longer possible to think of matter (nature) as a teleological order or organism; it was simply "dead." Such a material (natural) order can never provide an adequate context for human existence, as the nature of the ancients did, for there is no intelligible grounding here for the purpose, meaning, and value which have such importance in human life. In this situation man must resign himself to existence in an impersonal and ultimately inhuman world (nature) or seek to live in relation to some extra-natural ground of meaning and purposiveness (God). It was Kant who perceived this development and its significance most clearly, con- structing his metaphysics and ethics accordingly. "Against the eighteenth-century position that man is a part of nature and ought to be subservient to her laws, Kant reacted by inverting the order and making nature what she is because of how she appears to us. Then he transcended even this Copernican venture by daring to weigh nature in the scales of reason and to declare that she is wanting and does not contain the destiny of man. The practical - what man ought to be and how he ought to transform his existence - in this conception takes precedence over what nature is and what she demands of man as part of her order. Nature produced man but brought him to the stage where he can finally assert his in- dependence of her." (L. W. BECK, A Commentary on Kant's Critique of Practical Reason [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1960], 125.)</page><page sequence="11">CONCEPT OF NATURE 347 But when, with Giordano Bruno and others, nature itself became viewed as infinite, there was no longer any independent role for (the concept of) God to play; all metaphysical needs could be fulfilled by nature. So in Spinoza God and nature became identified with each other - it not being possible to conceive of two infinites - but the identification occurred under the imagery of the concept of nature (i.e., natural process) rather than the concept of God (i.e., free agent).' What had been two ontologically distinct realities (God and creation) ordered toward each other in a very specific and distinctive way, so as to pre- serve the ultimate reality and importance of God, now became one reality (nature) viewed under two different aspects (natura naturans and natura naturata). And God no longer had an un- usurpable place in man's understanding of himself and of the context within which his life falls; indeed, it is not clear that God any longer had (could be conceived to have) any distinctive place at all.6 The concept of nature, I am suggesting, as it is used in much contemporary discussion both within religious circles and with- out, has concealed within it an implicit metaphysic. It is a concept seemingly broad and inclusive enough to take up into itself and find place for every aspect or dimension of experience, and it provides an interpretation and ordering of all those features of experience in a particular or definite way, the paradigm or model for which is natural process. Thus it is now clear that the "ambiguity" which we earlier noted in the concept - as to whether human culture is a part of nature or is its polar counter- part - decisively determines its fundamental meaning and really cannot be removed or overcome. "Nature" is a metaphysical concept and involves an understanding of what is (ultimately) real. But like all metaphysical concepts it is based on certain 'This is already foreshadowed in Scotus Erigena's fourfold concept of nature- God: i) nature uncreated and creating, or God in himself; 2) nature created and creating, or God as cause of all things; 3) nature created but not creating, or the world as continuous process; 4) nature neither creating nor created, or God as the consummation of the whole process. 'As PAUL TILLICH has noted, the well-known modern formula "deus sive natura . . indicates that the name 'God' does not add anything to what is already involved in the name 'nature.'" (Systematic Theology [University of Chicago Press, 195I], I, 262.)</page><page sequence="12">348 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW experiential models taken as clue or key to the real: "natural" powers and processes (as contrasted with "artificial" or "cul- tural") provide the paradigm.' The double entendre of "nature" is thus indispensable to its (contemporary) meaning and use. I do not mean to suggest, of course, that everyone who uses the word "nature," or everyone who is engaged in current eco- logical campaigns, is a secret believer in naturalism as a philos- ophy and is conducting an evangelistic campaign under that banner; most are probably quite unaware of these metaphysical tendencies and implications, and many would explicitly disavow them. I am arguing, however, that for those concerned about the question of men's fundamental stance in the world, their deepest convictions about what is real and true and good, their under- standing of what human life is all about and what is the broadest context within which it is lived - in short, for theologians - the concept will have to be subjected to careful scrutiny and used only with the greatest care. For the metaphysical tendencies implicit in it are not obviously congruent with those of Christian faith. III This may not be to the detriment of the concept of nature, however, for Christian faith in certain of its implications has probably seriously misled us in our quest for orientation in life and the world. A number have argued that the Christian under- standing of the world as God's creation governed by divine law, 'There are, of course, a variety of natural powers and processes which can serve as metaphysical paradigms, e.g., the vitality, growth, and evolution character- istic of life as understood in the biological sciences in contrast with the endless motion, mathematical order, and entropy characteristic of the matter studied in physics. Usually it is not simply the bare notion of "natural process" which provides the basis for the metaphysical concept of nature (i.e., nature viewed as the ultimate context of human life); rather it is one of these more concrete and particular kinds of natural order. In general one can say that if the subject- matter of biology is given this paradigmatic function, nature appears filled with vitality and activity and even teleological development, and human existence may seem meaningful and with hopeful prospects; when the subject-matter of physics provides the paradigm for understanding nature, however, we are confronted with images of mechanism and lifelessness and an ultimate future of icy death. (For elaboration, see STEPHEN TOULMIN, Contemporary Scientific Mythology, in S. TOULMAN, R. W. HEPBURN, and A. MACINTYRE, Metaphysical Beliefs [London: SCM Press, 1970], 60-65.)</page><page sequence="13">CONCEPT OF NATURE 349 with man its divinely appointed overlord, was an important presupposition of the development of modern experimental natural science, and thus of our modern understanding of nature.8 But it can also be argued that this same complex of presuppositions must bear considerable responsibility for the unrestricted ex- ploitation of nature which now threatens to destroy the delicate ecological balances that sustain all life.9 Therefore it cannot be regarded as self-evident that the traditional Christian view is either adequate or appropriate any longer to provide orientation in life. We must examine its features more closely. The principal terms of the Christian metaphysical scheme are three, God, man, and the world. All else takes place within a framework supplied by those terms. Even Jesus Christ, whom some might wish to give priority over these others, is defined as the "God-man": his being is thus grasped and made intelligible in terms of the more fundamental notions of God and man (how- ever much, as Karl Barth has argued, it eventually comes to qualify those notions). It is in fact these two terms, "God" and "man," which provide the basic framework within which the Christian drama is worked out; the notion of "world" ("heavens and earth") remains vague and largely undefined, referring to the context within which, or the stage upon which, the drama of salvation is worked out, but not itself having a significant role within that drama. It is Yahweh and Israel, God and man - or even, as in the later individualism of much Western Christendom, God and the soul (Augustine) -that are the realities of central interest and concern.'- Though man may be created out of the "dust from SSee, e.g., MICHAEL FOSTER, The Christian Doctrine of Creation and the Rise of Modem Natural Science, Mind 43 (1934), 446-68; and Christian Theology and Modem Science of Nature, Mind 44 (I935), 439-46, and 45 (1936), 1-27; R.

LYNN WHITE, JR., The Historical Roots of our Ecologic Crisis, Science 155 (I967), 1203-07. lo It is worth remembering in this connection that the Hebrew vocabulary did not even have a term corresponding to our word "nature." The fundamental unity and order of the context within which man lived was provided directly by God. (See H. W. ROBINSON, Inspiration and Revelation in the Old Testament [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1946], Ch. i.)</page><page sequence="14">350 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW the ground" (Gen. 2:7) and could not exist apart from a con- text provided by heaven and earth and the multitude of other living creatures on the earth (Gen. I), man is clearly the climax of God's creative activity. Created in God's own image (1:27), he is the one for whom all the rest were made and to whose will they must be subject (1:28-29; 2:I8-20; 15). He is the (only) creature, moreover, in whom God himself becomes incarnate. Although the incarnation has significance for all creation, the divine-human relation is clearly the axis around which all else revolves. In the end when God creates "new heavens and a new earth" (Isa. 65:17; Rev. 21: ), in which the fierce struggle in all life will be overcome ("The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, [and] the lion shall eat straw with the ox" [Isa. 65:251), this is primarily for the sake of the "new Jerusalem," where man can live with God in peace, and all human suffering, pain, and misery will be overcome (Isa. 65:18-24; Rev. 21:2-4). The great words of the Christian vocabulary - sin, salvation, forgiveness, repentance, hope, faith, love, righteousness -have to do primarily with man and with man's relation to God and to his fellows, and the principal conceptual work of Christian theology has been devoted to elaboration of profound interpreta- tions of man's nature and predicament and of the idea of God. The rest of creation, though always recognized and sometimes acknowledged and even reflected upon, simply was not of central theological interest or importance, and (with the exception of the angels) never became the subject of any technical theological vocabulary or doctrines. Moreover, the two central terms, "God" and "man," were understood to refer to realities which had a certain fundamental kinship with or likeness to each other, not shared by any other beings: man was created "in God's image," and God was prin- cipally conceived in terms of the human images of lord, king, warrior, judge, father, and the like. The ultimate reality which was the source and foundation of all else, that is to say, was thought of anthropomorphically, and man was believed to be at the very center of his interest and affection. Indeed, God so loved rebellious man that he gave "his only Son" (John 3:16) for our salvation. Man, thus, has a kinship with and connection</page><page sequence="15">CONCEPT OF NATURE 351 to the ultimate metaphysical reality not shared by anything else in all creation. It was hardly inappropriate, then, that for many Christian centuries the rest of the created order was seen to have its principal significance in the ways in which it symbolized or mirrored various aspects of the human problem or the divine- human relationship, having little or no significance in its own right." This theological attention to God and man and their relation- ship, and the relative disregard for nature or the world, was not an accident. An inner logic or consistency in Western religious traditions was being worked out here. A concept of God (or of the gods) is a means by which man gives ultimate metaphysical significance to the moral and personal side of his being, for it involves doctrines which interpret ultimate reality as moral and personal in character. This is not completely clear in polytheistic mythologies where the gods war with each other and often engage in activities which would be regarded as illegitimate for men. But in the movement to monotheism, where all (ultimate) power and value becomes centered in one being who thus becomes the focus of all devotion and loyalty, it becomes increasingly difficult to think of God as deficient in any respect. It is possible of course - and this has happened in some religious traditions - to attain the unity of world-view which monotheism achieves by moving toward pantheistic conceptions which tend to level moral distinctions and depreciate man's being as personal. But this did not happen in Israel. Instead Yahweh became increasingly viewed as the very epitome of moral righteousness whose judg- 11The turn away from such highly anthropocentric ways of interpreting the details of nature began during the high Middle Ages. LYNN WHITE regards St. Francis as quite important in this respect. "St. Francis first taught Europe that nature is interesting and important in and of itself. No longer were flames merely the symbol of the soul's aspiration: they were Brother Fire. The ant was not simply a homily to sluggards, the worm not solely a sermon on humility: now both were autonomous entities. St. Francis was the greatest revolutionary in history: he forced man to abdicate his monarchy over the creation, and instituted a democracy of all God's creatures. Man was no longer the focus of the visible universe. In this sense Copernicus is a corollary of St. Francis . .. . it was no accident that his order attracted men who flung themselves into furthering the new natural science and who became its leading exponents in the thirteenth century" (Natural Science and the Naturalistic Art in the Middle Ages, American Historical Review 52 [I1947], 433-34).</page><page sequence="16">352 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW ments and actions, even though often incomprehensible to human moral sensibilities (Habakkuk, Job), were finally to be accepted as ultimately right and good. Since the ultimate reality with which man had to do, the source of his being, was pre-eminently a personal and moral agent who required of his devotees not only absolute devotion but also moral rectitude, the moral side of human existence was, in this orientation, given the profoundest kind of metaphysical sanction possible, and true human existence became understood in terms of action, of willing and doing. Yahweh was one who acts, a personal and moral being, and so was the creature who had been made in his image. Thus, both man and that which was taken to be ultimately real were under- stood in terms of those features of man's being which most sharply distinguish us from other creatures, namely, the abilities to act, to decide, to order behavior by reference to preconceived and deliberately chosen ends, to devote ourselves to such values as righteousness, mercy, and love. It is not surprising, then, that the images in terms of which the cosmic context of human life was understood were not primarily organic or material but rather political: all of existence was God's kingdom over which he ruled as an oriental potentate. Wind and wave, Leviathan and lamb, as well as men - all were created by his will and word and obeyed his command as he worked out his will through all creation. The fundamental order in the world, thus, was moral and personal and political, and all else was to be understood as in some sense an expression of that (distinctly anthropomorphic) way of seeing the world.12 With this sort of orientation in life certain consequences follow directly. On the one hand, that which distinguishes man from the rest of creation - especially his volitional and moral capacities - will be emphasized as that which is the truly human, and men will increasingly see themselves as active beings, free 12 BOYCE GIBSON is correct in suggesting that precisely this notion of God is the ground of the strong sense of the meaningfulness of human life and activity characteristic of Hebrew culture. "Nowhere does fate play a smaller part than among the Hebrews; and the reason is that they resisted more firmly than any other civilization the assimilation of God to nature. Even the arbitrariness of their God had its compensations."

The rest of creation, on the other hand, so far as it does not consist of free moral agents like men, is primarily material for the Creator's (and man's) purposes. It is the context within which God and men are working, and it provides materials for their work. It has no will or purposes of its own; it knows no moral values and has no freedom of choice. It is there, thus, simply to be used by God and by men as they carry through their purposes. (Cf. Kant: only men with their rational wills are ends in themselves.) It is true, of course, that in their character as perfectly fulfilling the Creator's will for them, the birds and flowers can serve as a sort of moral and religious example to men (Mt. 6:26-30), but this is because men, unlike precisely those same flowers and birds, are beings capable of moral discrimination, beings who have some power to transform themselves in accord with the examples set before them: one does not admonish an oak or a robin moral- istically. The natural world, thus, is of an ontologically different order from man. Though man is a part of nature and has been made from natural materials, he is lifted far above the rest of nature by his moral and personal character: he is, indeed, the very image of nature's Creator and absolute lord. Thus, the conceptions of God and man, as they have developed in Western religious traditions, work hand in hand toward the distinguishing of man from (the rest of) nature. Nature is not conceived primarily as man's proper home and the very source and sustenance of his being, but rather as the context of and material for teleological activity by the (nonnatural) wills work- ing upon and in it."3 It is not really surprising that this kind of a18ALBRECHT RITSCHL put this in an especially sharp way: ".. . nature is called into being to serve as a means to God's essential purpose in creating the world of spirits . . . . the creation of nature by God is ... a relative necessity, the necessity, namely, of serving as a means to God's previously chosen end of calling into being a multitude of spirits akin to Himself. ... For the apparatus by which the individual life and all commerce in things spiritual is carried on, presupposes for its permanent existence the whole immeasurable system of the world, mechanical, chemical, organic ....

If nature was created by (God's) will for the sake of further volitional activity, how could (human) will be threatened simply by its strenuous exercise in nature? The picture I have been painting here is, of course, over- drawn. From the very beginning of Western religious conscious- ness there has been an awareness that the earth is not here for man to do with simply as he pleases: it is, after all, God's garden, and man is here only to "till it and keep it" (Gen. 2:15), not transform it into whatever he wishes. At best men are only stewards within God's creation. I have no desire to deny these motifs or their importance: it is undoubtedly with notions of this sort that theological reconstruction will have to work, at least in part. However - this is my central point here - the theological problem of nature is not simply one of rearranging emphases or details, lifting up certain motifs in the tradition which may have been neglected. It goes far deeper than that, into the logic of the central concepts of our religious tradition. The very ideas of God and man, as they have gradually been worked out over millennia, are so framed as to blur or even conceal man's em- beddedness in the natural order as we now are increasingly conceiving it. The great religious struggle between Israel and Canaan was over the question of the relative metaphysical im- portance of natural power and process on the one hand and per- sonal moral will on the other. When Yahweh won that struggle it meant that the object of ultimate loyalty and devotion for men in the West would be conceived increasingly in terms of models rooted in man's moral and personal experience, not in his and Reconciliation [Edinburgh: T. and T. Clark, 1900], 279-80). This general point of view was just as characteristic of neo-orthodoxy as of liberalism. See, e.g., the extensive examination of Karl Barth's theology with respect to the under- standing of nature by PAUL SANTMIRE: Creation and Nature: A Study of the Doctrine of Nature with Special Attention to Karl Barth's Doctrine of Creation (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation in Harvard Divinity School Library, 1966).</page><page sequence="19">CONCEPT OF NATURE 355 sense of dependence upon and unity with the orders and processes of nature. Thus the very concept of God itself - as that concept has developed in the West - has built into it a deprecia- tion of the metaphysical, and certainly the religious, significance of nature. If we are to make theological use of the modern notion of nature - and how can we any longer avoid it, since all our think- ing and experience is so heavily shaped by it? - we shall have to engage in theological reconstruction going down to the deepest roots of the Western religious sensibility and vocabulary. The idea of God as pre-eminently active moral will must be re- examined, as well as the correlative conception of man as fun- damentally moral and personal being, a conception to which this idea of God gives metaphysical support. What the outcome, or even the main direction, of such far-reaching reconstruction might be, I cannot say, but there is little question in my mind that it would transform Christian faith (as we now know it) in far more profound ways than seem to be imagined by many who now blithely call for a theology of nature or for ecological theology. IV I have been arguing in this paper that the concept of nature, as that concept is used in much contemporary discussion, and the Christian conception of God (and man), as that notion has developed historically, are not easily compatible. Each makes claims about the fundamental order in reality and proposes images in terms of which that order is to be understood; each thus contains within itself an implicit metaphysic. These meta- physical schemes disagree with each other at many points, not only in the paradigms or models by means of which ultimate reality is conceived, but also in their conceptions of man and of his place among other finite beings; their implications for religion and for ethics also sharply diverge at crucial points. In short, we seem to be confronted with two quite different world-views, not to be reconciled easily with each other. This conclusion, however, may not seem particularly persuasive</page><page sequence="20">356 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW to many. After all, Christian theology has always had categories for the interpretation of other finite beings than men. Is it really obvious that these can no longer do service? Even though we may be hesitant about the continuing viability of such a tradi- tional contrast as that between nature and supernature - the latter seeming to be a kind of unwarranted mythological re- doubling of the former - why can the present problems not be handled in terms of such concepts as nature/grace and Creator/ creation? These conceptual pairs seem to be constructed spe- cifically for the purpose of grasping the relation of the total finite order - not only man - to God; moreover, they seek to do so in a way that preserves the proper integrity of each. Nature-creation has an order and structure which gives it its unique character and which is the proper subject of the sciences; man is no god but is part of this created order, bound to it in every dimension of his being. It is true that the interconnection and interdependence of human existence with the rest of finite being was not, perhaps, as profoundly grasped in earlier centuries as is possible today with the help of the sciences. It may even have been held that man's soul was a direct gift of God, not part of his natural creaturely inheritance like his body. We today might wish to alter such judgments and regard man in his total personal existence as so bound up with the organic and physical orders which sustain and significantly constitute him as not to be con- ceivable in separation from them; and thus we might wish to drop the doctrine of the "soul" (as distinct from and contrasted with the "body") and speak instead simply of persons or selves. But surely such adjustments can be taken care of within the basic framework of Christian theology and need not be regarded as threatening the concept of God as the Creator (and Redeemer) of the world and of man. Are the difficulties raised in the foregoing sections of this paper, then, not largely pseudo-problems? If "nature" is under- stood to refer to "creation," cannot these problems all be resolved, provided appropriate adjustments are made to bring the in- terpretation of creation into accord with our modern knowledge of nature? If so, there is nothing to prevent us from maintaining</page><page sequence="21">CONCEPT OF NATURE 357 the structure of the traditional Christian world-view in its most fundamental and important features, however much we may alter the details of our understanding of the world. This is, of course, the move that always comes to mind first when contentions are made that seem to threaten the deepest reaches of Christian faith; and it is a move well worth exploring with great care. I certainly would not deny that it is possible in this way to give a theological interpretation to current scientific and historical knowledge which shows that our fundamental Christian concepts and doctrines have both the flexibility and the comprehensiveness to take up into themselves the most contemporary ideas and theories and incorporate them within an overall Christian perspective.14 However, such moves are not as simple as many appear to suppose. It is exceedingly difficult, for example, to specify what grace - i.e., personal- moral meaning - could actually refer to in a world understood primarily as nature (in the modern sense), i.e., in a world under- stood to be pervaded and structured by fundamentally nonhuman forms of order. This is because, as I have been arguing, the concept of nature is not in fact an entirely "innocent" or neutral notion but makes definite metaphysical claims. This ordinary sort of response, then- simply reinterpreting or adjusting a few concepts or doctrines - really begs the most significant issues. For it is based on the assumption that the fundamental Christian categories are adequate to grasp and interpret virtually any issue or problem which they may confront --i.e., on the assumption that the fundamental Christian claims are true in some irrevocable sense - and that the task of the theologian, therefore, is simply to find ways of adapting and adjusting and perhaps transforming these concepts and doctrines, so that they can continue to do their work. It is certainly possible, and from certain points of view appropriate, to proceed from such a stance. But that conception of the task of theology precludes ever raising seriously the question about the truth of the basic Christian claims themselves, and thus also the question of the continuing "4I have myself frequently taken this route, most obviously perhaps in my Systematic Theology: a Historicist Perspective (New York: Scribner's, I968), esp. in Pts. II and III (cf. also the Introduction), and in God the Problem (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1972), ch. 6.</page><page sequence="22">358 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW appropriateness and viability of the principal Christian categories. This sort of question can be seriously explored only if we are willing to entertain and examine perspectives sharply different from the Christian, to see whether other conceptual frameworks, perhaps, might not more adequately comprehend and interpret certain facets of experience and features of the world. It is an issue of this widest and most fundamental sort, I am suggesting, with which Christian theology is confronted by the concept of nature. Although we may be inclined to attempt to treat this issue intramurally, it would be a mistake to do so. For resolving the problem of nature and of man's immersion within nature simply through subsuming it under the traditional category of creation would result only in papering over and temporarily concealing from ourselves the deepest issues which this concept raises, namely, the question about the fundamental metaphysical models and paradigms with which Christian theol- ogy has ordinarily worked. Are these personalistic and political metaphors and concepts - including especially, of course, the concept of God - really appropriate or adequate any longer to do justice to our experience of ourselves as natural beings and our knowledge of the world as a complex of natural orders? Is not the notion of nature, as the systematic interconnection of all (natural) powers and processes and the foundation and source of all finite beings and events, a conception more nearly congruent with both our modern experience of ourselves and our modern knowledge of the world? I am not here arguing that an affirmative answer to this latter question is in fact true; I am arguing, how- ever, that this is the real question for theology which the modern concept of nature poses, and this question, therefore, is the one to which we ought to give our attention. We should not obscure from ourselves the magnitude or importance of this issue by (relatively easy) demonstrations that the Christian conceptual scheme can still be made to work by a little stretching here and a little hauling there, and then congratulating ourselves on our modernity. We serve Christian faith best by facing with open eyes the full dimension of the challenge posed by contemporary naturalism and secularism even though that involves a radical reassessment of the most basic Christian beliefs.</page><page sequence="23">CONCEPT OF NATURE 359 V Having noted certain problems for the Christian conceptuality raised by the modern understanding of man's rootedness in na- ture, it is important to observe that there are equally serious difficulties confronting the (metaphysical) use of the concept of nature itself, difficulties also connected with the problem of the understanding of man. I have been arguing that the characteristic metaphysical procedure of the Western religious tradition, cul- minating in explicit theological reflection and analysis, has been to take that which is distinctively human - man's moral and personal being and experience - as paradigmatic for understand- ing the fundamental context of human life (God's purposes and acts) and the ultimate reality with which we have to do (God). There is an intimate connection, therefore, between man's aware- ness of himself as a personal and moral being and the theological understanding of him as a creature and subject in God's kingdom, and the latter provides what is obviously an especially appro- priate metaphysical underpinning and reinforcement for the former. As we have seen, however, man's immersion in and dependence upon the rest of nature - i.e., his existence as a fundamentally natural being - raises serious problems for these basically anthropocentric procedures of the theological position and for the basically anthropomorphic metaphysic in which they eventuate. We must look now at the reverse face of these correla- tions: is the concept of man as simply a natural being, and of nature as ultimate reality, able to do (metaphysical) justice to the personal and moral sides of man's being, to that which constitutes him as distinctively human? There are very serious problems here for naturalism which do not admit of any easy solution. It may seem at first that there should be no real problem here, for the concept of nature (like the concept of world) intends a reality which includes within itself all finite beings, and thus of course men. It is clear that mankind is simply a complex de- velopment out of lower forms of life and could not exist apart from continuous interrelation with other living forms and with</page><page sequence="24">360 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW the physical environment provided by earth. Man has modified his environment in many ways, but this is also true of all other forms of life, though perhaps not to so great a degree; every feature of human behavior has its analogy in animal existence; the highest spiritual aspirations of men, their most rational processes of thought, their deepest religious convictions can (must) all be understood as rooted in natural biological and physical processes. Though he is a highly complex natural being, one who enters into relationship with the rest of nature on levels and in ways perhaps not duplicated by any other, he is surely to be understood as fully included within nature. There are several problems with this commonsense approach. In the first place it assumes that nature is a kind of thing, an object, that includes within itself all other objects or things of which man is one. But, as we have seen (in our consideration of the concept "world"), there is and can be no all-inclusive object of this sort at all. "Nature" is a concept by means of which we order our thinking in certain important respects: what kind of "object" it actually refers to we have no way, and could in prin- ciple have no way, of knowing (or even of imagining). It is a concept with which we seek to comprehend and relate all the objects of experience as ordered in space and time; and man also, of course, so far as he is conceived as an object of ex- perience, interrelated in various spatial and temporal and organic ways with other objects of experience, quite properly is thought of as "within" nature. But what about man conceived as the one who is thinking this whole system of concepts and ex- periencing this world of objects? How is he to be conceived as at once thinker and experiencer and at the same time one of the objects of thought and of experience? The problems to which I am pointing here are not new- they have been thoroughly investigated by the philosophical idealists - but they are very serious. They indicate, as Hegel particularly brought out, that the self is that peculiar kind of being (unlike any other of which we have experience) that is reflexive upon itself in such a way that it can become object to itself; or better, as subject (not object) it is aware of itself as subject while it is simultaneously aware of the objects con-</page><page sequence="25">CONCEPT OF NATURE 361 fronting it. "Nature," however, is among those objects (of thought), however all-comprehensive an object it may be. The self or subject is never an object in this sense, is never ex- perienced as one, and it is a serious category mistake to attempt to conceive it as one. How then is it (logically) possible to conceive selves as "included within" nature, the realm of objects of experience and thought? It can be done only if (with Hegel) we conceive nature as itself in some ultimate sense Subject,"1 i.e., as self-reflexive being and thus able to take up other modes of self-reflexiveness within itself. But to do this would be precisely to reject the fundamental paradigm in terms of which our concept of nature is built up - natural powers and processes in the complex interrelations in which we experience and think them in the sciences --and it would be to substitute as our metaphysical paradigm a model based on the concept of the self. This latter kind of move, as we have seen, is the basis for the concept of God: to move in this way would be to substitute a (formally) theological for a naturalistic metaphysic. The concept of nature, thus, can be supposed all-compre- hensive only when we think it abstractly, i.e., when we think it as a bare form which is supposed to be capable of containing within itself and ordering all other concepts. But when we try to think it concretely, i.e., when we try actually to conceive all other forms in terms of the sort of order and relationship specified by the concept of nature, it cannot be done: the com- plexities of the concept of the self simply cannot be subsumed under "nature" without giving nature at least as much (self- reflexive) complexity as a self. It is questionable, then, whether the implicit metaphysic of the concept of nature can ever actually be worked out. A naturalistic metaphysics seems plausible be- cause selves are embodied. In some sense we "see" and "ex- perience" them as we do other objects in the spacetime order. They obviously stand in some kind of systematic relationship to these other objects, and it seems plausible, therefore, to regard selves as simply part of nature. However, this is to presume that 156. . . everything depends on grasping and expressing the ultimate truth not as Substance but as Subject as well" (Phenomenology of Mind [London: G. Allen and Unwin, 1931], 8o),</page><page sequence="26">362 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW precisely those objective characteristics and relations are ex- haustively constitutive for selves, and that is an error." If the argument just stated (all too briefly) seems excessively abstract and "metaphysical," let me come at the fundamental issues in another way. "Nature," we have seen, is a concept by means of which we intend to indicate the systematic totality of all finite beings and processes (including ourselves). This totality, of course, is never directly experienced by us as an object: it is by means of this concept, and this alone, that nature becomes an object to us and for us. But in this way it does become an object to us, i.e., a totality over against us or before us, for us to contemplate. This very fact, however, implies that in some sense we are (must think of ourselves as) over against nature, contemplating it, observing the events and objects that constitute it, seeking means of control over it. Though we think of ourselves as included within nature, unlike any other natural object we sufficiently transcend nature to make it an object of our thought and to gain some understanding of and control over its processes. In these moves we necessarily think of ourselves as operative upon nature as well as within nature, as external to it as well as internal. We are that point in nature where nature transcends itself (becoming something other?) and becomes reflexive; thus we are able to enter into deliberate self-conscious operations upon nature. And so we have built up the whole (nonnatural) realm of culture, wherein nature is rearranged not only in accord with our needs (as is true in varying degrees for all forms of life), but in accord with deliberately chosen ends and values which we have ourselves imaginatively created. The concept of nature, we have noted, gets its distinctive quality and feel in 1 Of course, there always have been, and doubtless there always will be, materialist or physicalist interpretations of selfhood, and much is to be learned from studying these. These perspectives are always based, however, on a preferred status given to the objective or observable sides of selves, i.e., to third-person language. One does not need to move all the way to idealism to be persuaded that there is a dimension of selfhood ("subjectivity") which cannot be handled in purely objective or descriptive categories; first-person language seems in principle not to be reducible to second-person or third-person language. It would seem to be impossible in principle, therefore, to grasp these dimensions of selfhood (the "I") in terms of the concept of "nature" with its essentially descriptivist or objectivist categories. Something - precisely that which essentially characterizes the "I" as I - will always be left out.</page><page sequence="27">CONCEPT OF NATURE 363 large part from the contrast with the artificial, the contrived, the cultural. This being the case, it is not possible (except abstractly and equivocally) to regard this realm of culture, and man himself so far as he is a cultural being, as straightforwardly natural. These fall outside or above nature (cf. "supernature") and are superimposed on it. Unlike other natural beings who are simply under nature's sway, are expressions of its powers and laws, man has developed modes of existence and reflection which give him considerable powers over nature. And in the course of history he has totally transformed his life from the natural forms which it originally had into the distinctively human form of existence within society and culture. Thus, as Hegel observed, if man's nature is said to be (in accordance with the etymology of the word) man's original condition, then, his nature is characterized by unfree- dom, unconsciousness, unculture; 17 for freedom and conscious- ness and culture all develop only in history, as man moves away from his original nature and creates for himself another, new "historical nature." 18 In (human) history nature becomes some- thing new and different and other from itself. Thus man cannot be understood as a merely natural being, i.e., in terms of merely natural powers and processes; if he is to be understood at all, it will be as a historico-natural being. His recently developed consciousness of and concern with his place in nature, and with the way in which his cultural activity seriously disturbs the ecological balances of nature, will be properly understood only if they are seen as a new stage of his- torical development and a new level of cultural awareness. Here man's reflexive self-consciousness is penetrating deeper into itself as he becomes increasingly sensitive to hitherto unrecognized repercussions of his activities and thus gains new and deeper levels of freedom from and over the natural world which is his home. It would be a gross and unfortunate misunderstanding if the newly heightened interest in man's immersion in nature were 17 See, e.g., Philosophy of History (New York: Dover, 1956), 40-41. 18Cf. KARL MARX: "It is that nature which he develops in history which is the real nature of man" (quoted in Philosophisches Wirterbuch, ed. G. Klaus and M. Buhr [Berlin: Europiische Buch, 1970], 769).</page><page sequence="28">364 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW taken to mean that human life in culture and society should be disparaged or that man is fundamentally a "natural" rather than a "historical" being. It is only because of his historical existence in culture that ecological sensitivities are possible, and it will only be through a further sophistication of his cultural life that the ecological problems of which we have lately become aware may be in some measure met. There is no way "back to nature" for man; there is only the (hoped for) possibility of a movement forward into a more profound and sensitive freedom. VI We have not, in these last remarks, in any way lessened the tensions between naturalistic and theistic positions. I am not at this point clear how that is to be done or whether it can be done. I have tried to show that those tensions arise out of our appre- hension of the two-sidedness of man, his embeddedness in nature and his personal-moral-historical transcendence of nature as a free and creative agent. If the natural processes in which human life seems rooted are taken as the clue to the ultimate reality with which he has to do, a naturalistic metaphysics results; if moral and historical experience are paradigmatic, we are led to a concept of God. Both immersion in and transcendence of nature seem to be genuine features of our human existence, and so long as these appear to us as polar opposites, there is little hope that the metaphysical dilemma with which we have been concerned can be resolved. However, we may be moving toward conceptual developments which will make it possible to gain a more unified view. Nature appears to be increasingly understood, in modern science and philosophy, with the aid of analogies and models drawn from man's historical experience of himself;9" the concepts of process, event, development, evolution have become fundamental, and nature no longer appears as a static and immovable lawful structure but as an exceedingly complex configuration of hum- ming energies. Moreover, on the other side, our understanding "1See R. G. COLLINGWOOD, The Idea of Nature (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1945).</page><page sequence="29">CONCEPT OF NATURE 365 of human psychology and biology is increasingly making clear how all man's functions are rooted in and presuppose his bodili- ness; Descartes' sharp duality of mind and body is no longer tenable either philosophically or scientifically. If we are moving, then, toward a more profound understanding of the way in which everything historical is deeply rooted in nature and to new conceptions of nature as itself having a history continuous with the evolution and the history of man,20 we may be on the way to developing concepts of historical nature, or the nature of history, which will be inclusive both of what we now call nature and what we now call history. What implications such a history-nature concept would have for theology and what kind of theological reconstruction it might call for cannot be guessed at this point. But it would seem obvious that neither our traditional theological framework, as we now understand it, nor the naturalistic schemes presently available to us will be able to persist without considerable modification.21 20 Cf. C. F. VON WEIZSXCKER, The History of Nature (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, i949). 'Some may regard Whitehead's philosophy, with its stress on nature as process, as already showing the way to this new notion of nature-history; others may see such possibilities in Hegel. Although both of these men have con- tributed much toward an understanding of reality as processive and historical, I do not think either succeeds in resolving the issues with which we are here concerned. Hegel is certainly sensitive to the problems of conceiving the self and reality in such a way as to make place for the distinctive self-reflexive character of selfhood; however, though he attempts to carry through his dialectical meta- physics into the interpretation of nature, he does not succeed in developing a very persuasive conception, probably in part because he was working prior to both modem evolutionary biology and also the new physics, and thus did not have available to him means to interpret natural phenomena in historical or processive terms. On the other hand, though Whitehead certainly exploits such modern scientific developments in working out his philosophy of organism and process, and thus produces a concept of nature in many ways open to reconcilia- tion with the problems raised by history and selfhood, even using concepts and images drawn from self-experience (e.g., "subjective aim," "feeling," "decision") to articulate his understanding of the ultimate metaphysical realities, he does not seem to have clearly grasped the distinctive self-reflexive character of the self and the peculiar problems which it raises for metaphysical conceptualization, and he devotes very little attention to the consequently peculiar character of the historical order in contrast with evolutionary and other natural processes. Instead, his conception seems rooted largely in his analysis of the notions of process, event, and organism, as these grow out of the contentions and claims of the (largely objectivist) natural sciences. Whereas Hegel thus seems too far on the history side of the history-nature polarity with which we have been con-</page><page sequence="30">366 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW cerned, Whitehead remains too far on the nature side; neither is sufficiently aware of the problems raised by both sides of this polarity to be able to transcend it and produce a truly unifying conceptual scheme. Some might wish to claim that Teilhard de Chardin has produced such a conceptual apparatus. Certainly he has provided us with a unified vision of nature-history, and that is un- doubtedly an important achievement. But it is not clear that his fundamental notions have been thought through with sufficient rigor to enable us actually to conceive nature and history in one unified and comprehensive metaphysical scheme. More significant in this regard, perhaps, is PAUL TILLICH. Volume III (1963) of his Systematic Theology, the importance and originality of which has not been widely noted, attempts to work through these issues by developing the concept of life as an all-embracing metaphysical category. Tillich's work here certainly calls for careful consideration. However, I suspect that the development of concepts adequate for grasping history-nature awaits some future genius. Or perhaps it is never to be accomplished. Perhaps the contrasts of self and world, of mind and body, of history and nature, of subject and object, of man and the rest of creation are finally irreducible (cf.
