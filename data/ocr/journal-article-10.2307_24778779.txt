<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sporting Humor in Victorian Literature , J; ^ ^ ^ WlH By Coral Lansbury In the middle years of the nineteenth century, Thackeray looked back and felt that he had lived in two worlds, and to his dismay found those two worlds struggling for supremacy within him. The jokes of children are not the jokes of adults, and Thackeray remembered with some shame that he had enjoyed the brutal contests of men and animals that occasioned so much mirth when he was a boy. Pierce Egan, St. John and Badcock pro vided their public with considerable merriment at the expense of gutted dogs and torn bulls, cocks flayed to a bloody pulp and boxers beating their opponents into insensibility. The description was always more hilarious than the event with "Nimrod's" (Charles James Apperley) classical allusions blurring the reality of a broken winded hunter being flogged to keep up with the pack, a horse cut to the ribs with raking spurs, or the fox dropping</page><page sequence="2">66 Sporting Humour in Victorian Literature with exhaustion before his brush was hacked off and his carcase thrown to the hounds. This was the sporting humour of the early years of the century and Thackeray had enjoyed it like most men and women of his age. Now he felt remorse and guilt that something in him should still be stirred by the old bloody yarns of Egan and the sporting prints of Seymour and Rowlandson. Thackeray could not forget the exploits of Egan's Tom and Jerry, even though he was unable to find a copy of the work after 1860. Taste had changed and Egan was only to be found in certain bachelors' libraries or country houses like Squire Tempest's1 where bucolic barbarity set the tone. Thackeray's search for Egan's work was fruitless: "we have been to the British Museum, and no less than five circulating libraries in quest of the book and 'Life in London,'2 alas, is not to be found in any of them."3 The "alas" betrayed his feelings, for despite his affirmation that the work was "absolutely vulgar" it remained as a constant jolting memory and disturbing proof of what he had been, and perhaps still was at heart. Tom and Jerry were the bucks of their day, "Corinthians" of the first order, "drinking a great deal too much in Tom Cribb's parlour: they used to go and see 'life' in the gin-shops; of nights, walking home (as well as they could), they used to knock down 'Charleys,' poor harmless old watch men with lanterns, guardians of the streets of Rome, Planco Consule! They perpetrated a vast deal of boxing; they put on the 'mufflers' in Jackson's rooms; they attended cock-fights, and were enlightened patrons of dogs and destroyers of rats."4 This was the measure of popular sporting humour, people and animals abused and tormented in ritual displays of violence. But it was a humour that few found distasteful. Thomas Hood, who several years later felt Pickwick Papers "vulgar," and "all a sort of Tom and Jerryism,"5 could commend Egan's Boxiana to Miss Charlotte Reynolds in 1823 with the words: "I have been skimming Boxiana and think you would like it for there are three thick volumes with plates."6 It would not have been thought suitable for any refined reader after 1840. Bullbaiting, cockfights, dogfights, cock stoning and duck drowning were all popular and traditional sports at the turn of the century, reflecting the society which relished them. Life was dangerous, brief and painful for the majority of people. Children were particularly subjected to physical abuse. Servants were kicked and beaten, children regularly flogged at home or in school. Even an aristocratic child could recall the welts and bruises inflicted as part of his education. It was only courage and physical strength that kept the bully in his place or fought off footpads in the night. Every man knew that the occasion might arise when he would need his cane or his fists to save his life. "Almost as a matter of course John Dalton records being mugged 1M. E.

However, the victim of Dalton's time might later have had the pleasure of seeing his assailant hanged at Newgate. Possibly the pleasure of that occasion would soothe his pride and make him laugh at present pain and past fears. Thackeray knew that a hanging was the jolliest occasion possible, but he did not probe too deeply for the source of that humour: "It is curious that a murder is a great inspirer of jokes. We all like to laugh and have our fling about it, and there is a certain pleasure in the circumstance—a perpetual jingling antithesis between life and death, that is sure of its effects."8 The antithesis was not subjected to a dialectical process that may well have led to an indictment of the victim's society. Humour has always seen disorder where order is proclaimed as the norm. It has sought out the incongruities that lie beneath a superficial harmony and it has disrupted the fragile synthesis of social conformity. Humour is an iconoclast. From beyond recorded time men have masqueraded as animals, and animals have been depicted as men—often as surrogates for human aggression. To tie an owl to a duck's back and watch it drown in its attempts to escape the screaming bird was an hilarious parody of those who knew that there was no escape from the trammels of die law. It was a sport that confirmed the social condition but made it endurable through laughter. If it was illegal or impractical for men to duel, then cocks could be armed with metal spurs, and the language describing these combats would employ the classic terminology of the swordsman to comic effect. A bull harassed by dogs was like a man set upon by a band of young hooligans; or, in another variation, with Badcock's sympathy for the dogs, it could be seen as authority challenged by the crowd.9 People were able to experience the dangers of life vicariously through the suffering of animals, and the contrast itself was deemed humorous. As Pirandello wrote: "While the sociologist describes social life as it appears from external manifestations, the humorist, armed with his keen intuition, reveals how profoundly different the outer appearances are from what takes place in the inner consciousness."10 Blood sports were a fumbling attempt to exorcise reality. The sporting humorist shattered the reality and expelled it in laughter. Writers like Badcock and Egan did not deny the devil, but they taught their readers to mock him. It was enjoyable for a timid man like Thackeray to read Egan's Boxiana in which the brute reality was tempered by meiosis—the linguistic understate ment that defines the early sporting humour. The bull's horns were "prickers," a boxer's blood "claret," and fear was dissipated in laughter. The comedy of blood sports employed two mimetic processes. The event itself set life at a distance by using animal surrogates for human combatants; the writer or cartoonist then distorted the imitation further by using a baroque style that is continually deflated with understatement.

Egan's prose, a torrent of italics, exclamation marks and hyphens, was itself as far removed from ordinary speech as Cockaigne is from Cornwall. It employed every rhetorical trope, flourishes of manic exaggeration collapsing into sudden bathos, phrases culled from chivalry, cant words and Latin tags to produce a reality of its own. Seldom did Egan use his sporting anecdotes to hold a mirror to society—a veridical imitation of life would destroy the linguistic reality that he created with so much care. There was nothing of the moralist in his rendering of sporting events—Cruikshank wanted Tom and Jerry to come to sticky ends, but Egan was outraged at the suggestion. He enjoyed his cockfights and bullbaiting, and he knew how to make them palatable for sensitive readers like Thackeray. It was for a later age to record coolly: "It may be said of Mr. Pierce Egan that he touched nothing which he did not disfigure."11 It was not enough to translate violence into sport and then laugh it to impotence. The reality was omnipresent. It was not only the Evangelicals who saw the brutishness of the cockfight and prize ring slouching through the streets. The argument remained the same and can be found stated by Lord Ashley and Wilberforce at the beginning of the century and in the pamphlets of the R.S.P.C.A. and antivivisection societies at the end of the century: "habitual familiarity with the infliction of pain upon animals has a decided tendency to engender a sort of careless indifference regarding suffer ing."12 It became indecent to laugh with Egan at the baited bull "singed" with hot irons and the dog blinded with rat bites. People now saw the pain and the cruelty and the reflection of that cruelty in the faces of the crowd around the ring. The vision was grotesque and made people shiver instead of laugh. The triumph of the Yahoos was not a comic spectacle. Emily and Anne Brontë recorded instances in their novels of children who tortured animals and then became warped and brutal adults. Romantic anthropomorphism was reinforced with Evangelicalism to become a powerful force against the cruder blood sports. Had not Christ noted the fall of a sparrow and Blake seen "all heaven in a rage" at a caged robin? It was no longer amusing to witness suffering as a sport in humans or animals. The boxers who had been heroes to the fancy were now despised by all but a rakish clique. The prizefighter, John Gully, acquired wealth from the ring and the turf, and a seat in the House of Commons, but it was not an election that met with wide approbation. John Smith wrote of Gully's triumph in 1832: "You ask me the cause that made Pontefract sully Her fame by returning to Parliament Gully. The etymological cause I suppose is His breaking the bridges of so many noses."13 It was bad enough that a man should gain Parliament with his fists; there "William B.

Andrew Tuer recorded with wry chagrin his meeting with an old "pug" in the heart of London: Walking one foggy afternoon towards dusk along the Bayswater Road, I was accosted by a shivering and coatless vagabond who offered a tract. Wishing to shake off so unsavoury a companion, I attempted to cross the road, but a few yards from the kerb he barred further progress. "Six pence Sir, only sixpence, I must have sixpence!" and as he spoke he bared a huge arm knotted like a blacksmith's. Raising a fist a match, he more than once shot it out unpleasantly near, exhibiting every time he did so an eruption of biceps perfectly appalling in its magnitude. That tract is at home somewhere.14 Social order required the abolition of sports that inflamed the crowd, setting standards of violent behaviour that could lead to aggressive attacks on people and property. It was not only the working class that had to be held in check. Tom and Jerry were hardly representatives of the labouring poor. Elizabeth Gaskell recalled the Yorkshire squires presiding over the traditional bull baiting, and, as late as 1865 "when R.S.P.C.A. officials interrupted a Hay market cockfight... they came upon a Captain Augustus Berkeley acting as chairman and referee."15 Those who delighted in blood sports and found their vagaries a constant source of humour were defenders of the past, tra ditionalists who saw England's old fraternity being cast aside by a conspiracy "of Jacobins and Methodists to render the people grave and serious,"16 as Mr. Windham, the vociferous defender of bullbaiting in the House, declared. But it was not to be the past that prevailed on this occasion. The turning point in Victorian society can be seen in the changed attitude to blood sports. "This conflict was very often between what was to make for a more humane, more civilized and more equitable society in place of indefensible survivals or the product of mere primitive savagery."17 Thackeray was to state in 1853 that "the best humour is that which contains most humanity. . . ,"18 Thomas Hood embodied the changed attitude to sporting humour in the development of his own writing. He had once laughed at animals, seeing them as parodies of men; later he guyed the sportsman and made the hunter the victim of his intended prey. In an early poem of 1822, "The Fall of the Deer," the humour had been the spectacle of animal as man: And see the wild Stag how he stretches The natural Buck-skin of his Breeches, Running like one of Human Kind, Dogged by fleet Bailiffs close behind—19 14Andrew Tuer, Old London Street Cries and the cries of To-Day with Heaps of Quaint Cuts (London, 1885), p. 48. 1BBrian Harrison, Religion and Recreation in Nineteenth Century England," Past and Present, No. 38, Dec. 1967, p. 118. leThe Amusements of Old London, vol. 1, p. 33. 17G.

The New Sporting Magazine of 1832 deliberately excluded the old blood sports: "We expressly stated in our prospectus, that Prize fighting, Bull-baiting and Cock-fighting were low and demoralising pursuits and all reference thereto was to be excluded from our pages." Dickens re duced Corinthian Tom to the addled Mr. Toots in Dombey and Son (1848) who paid the Game Chicken ten and sixpence three times a week to knock him about the head. Boxing was useful to inculcate "manliness" into school boys, but gentlemen could not afford to sport cauliflower ears and black eyes in public. It was Punch, first published in 1841, which established the accepted patterns of sporting humour. Initially the analogy of animal and man in a blood sport was used without fear of arousing public criticism. It was in the tradition of Egan, for example, to compare Lord John Russell's refusal to leave office with a badger beset by terriers: "overpowered by numbers he must 'come out' at last and yield the victory to his numerous persecutors, who will no doubt, plume themselves upon their dexterity at drawing a badger."22 This form of comic reference soon ceased to please and while sport remained the constant analogue for politics, it was not the old bloodsports but fox-hunting and cricket that provided the parodied image. Even in fox hunting Punch's illustrators were careful not to show the fox. Horses and riders canter and draw up baffled, but the fox is invisible. Anthony Trollope was a dedicated and inveterate hunter but he too felt that the fox was "a poor beast" deserving of pity. Cruelty to animals could no longer be regarded as a naturally humorous subject. Too many people were beginning to look at the sport with the same eyes as the American Senator Gotobed who wondered aloud whether it was "worth the while of all those men to expend all that energy for such a result."23 It was a sentiment that Trollope could not voice himself, or permit any of his English characters to utter. Wilde crystallised this sentiment when he spoke of "the unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable." The Queen approved of the R.S.P.C.A. and antivivisection societies, but she also gave her warm support to stag and fox-hunting and shooting—in season. These had now become exclusively aristocratic sports. Punch took 20"A Foxhunter," 1833, p. 136. 21"Letter From An Old Sportsman," The Comic Annual, 1832, p. 98. 22Punch, vol.

Hunting allowed the caricaturist to toss the swell into every ditch and quagmire. A rider goes over the horse's head as the animal baulks at a hedge under the caption, "Look Before You Leap." Horses were always depicted with expressions of worldly sagacity on their faces in situations that would have delighted Swift. Punch's foxhunters spent more time fishing for frogs than they did on horseback. "Sporting Intelligence:—(From our own Correspondent) 'The country is awfully deep, but the falling is delightfully soft and safe.' "24 And in Rotten Row the same fatuous young sprig could be seen leaning languidly across the railing: "Old Mr. Dibbs:—'Why George! You never ride here in the afternoon— How's that? Young Swellington:—No-o-o. It looks as if one had some occupation, you know, and couldn't wide of a morning. I always wide before break fast, between eleven and one.' "25 These young men had learned to live energetic lives doing nothing but playing games. Punch considered it a subject for ridicule, but George Mere dith saw it as the ethos of a refined and sophisticated nation. For Meredith any sort of sport was preferable to war games, and the society which organized leisure in sporting activities was more advanced morally than the country that made leisure a time to train for war. Mr. Romfrey in Beauchamp's Career (1876) saw the English preference for sport as a sophisticated refinement of international diplomacy: Our England holds possession of a considerable portion of the globe, and it keeps the world in awe to see her bestowing so considerable a portion of her intelligence upon her recreations. To prosecute them with her whole heart is an ingenious exhibition of her power. Mr. Romfrey was of those who said to his country-men, "Go yachting; go cricketing; go boat-racing; go shooting; go horse-racing, nine months of the year, while the other Europeans go marching and drilling."26 Meredith and Trollope both saw sport as a substitute for war and felt that the leisured classes were far better employed, for their own and society's good, when playing cricket instead of training to be soldiers. It was R.S. Surtees who made fox-hunting the mirror for human vanity in the person of Mr. Jorrocks, "a great city grocer of the old school," who spent his life "hunting one day and selling teas another.... Nay, he some times did both together and they tell a story of him in Wiltshire, holloaing out to a man who had taken a fence to get rid of him, 'Did you say two chests o' black and one o' green?

Like many members of the hunting set, Jorrocks knew the most honourable title a man could pin to his name was not M.P., but Master of Fox Hounds. To be master of a hunt was Jorrocks' passionate ambition and in one of his "Sporting Lectors" he revealed the Parnassus of his hopes: "Of all sitivations under the sun none is more enviable or more 'onerable than that of a master of fox-'ounds! Talk of an M.P.! vot's an M.P. compared to an M.F.H.? Your M.P. lives in a tainted hatmosphere among other M.P.'s and loses his consequence by the commonness of the office, and the scoldings he gets from those who sent him there, but an M.F.H. holds his levee in the kennel, and his levee in the 'untin' field— is great and important everywhere—has no one to compete with him, no one to find fault, but all join in doing honour to him to whom honour is so greatly due (cheers)."28 The new rich, the aristocracy as distinct from the gentry, and the military were all drubbed in Surtees's novels. In the preface to Handley Cross, Lord Lonsdale explains the curious references that so often crop up in Hansard. It was enough to mention hunting in an assumed Cockney accent, and the House would respond with billows of laughter. Surtees remained a constant source of anecdotes for politicians—and Lord Lonsdale made more use of them than most: "Who would not laugh at the jokes, admire the wisdom and be excited by the fire of Jorrocks' 'Sporting Lectors,' which are so often quoted, especially in the political sphere."29 That politicians should find so much to emulate in Mr. Jorrocks was in itself a comic revelation that Lord Lonsdale did not investigate. It was Jorrocks that inspired Dickens in the creation of Mr. Pickwick. But between the two characters there is a universe of difference in the comic vision they evoke. Crude, ostentatiously vulgar, mean and spiteful, Mr. Jorrocks would steal a horse if he could get away with it—Mr. Pickwick, the soul of honesty, would be unjustly accused of stealing a horse. Jorrocks would not baulk at any crime, except that of vulpicide. Dickens looks beyond the comic savagery of Jingle's single wicket match, in which the natives fall like flies, to Pickwick who is the heart of the book and the embodiment of the essential innocence of man. Jorrocks is a gluttonous and bibulous rogue, crafty in the ways of men, but Pickwick speaks for a nature that is not corrupted by society, but often persecuted by it. It is against Pickwick's innocence that the corrupted world is judged and found wanting. Even when dragged from the icy pond he reproaches no one for his plight and celebrates his rescue over hot punch to everyone's satisfaction. Only when others indulge in stupidity and violence does his anger rise, and then that anger is more righteous indignation than wrath, like Mr. Winkle on skates or the same gentleman aiming for rooks and winging Mr. Tupman. This goodness makes the brutal comedy of Pickwick Papers (1837) bearable. Weiler and his son chaff in gallows humour; every sporting occasion is wild farce barely 28Ibid., ch. 11. 29Handley Cross, Popular Edition (London, n.d.), p. 6.</page><page sequence="9">Sporting Humour in Victorian Literature 73 masking the underlying aggression. Throughout the work there is the jingling antithesis between life and death that Thackeray observed on another oc casion. But Pickwick is always present to defend man against society, and human nature that is intrinsically innocent and guileless against those who have been deformed by society. To read Egan and Surtees is to see aggression as the dominant human characteristic; to follow Mr. Pickwick and his com panions is to see innocence and kindness as the natural condition of man. Games are essentially patterns of life embodying certain social principles. In lieu of war the English, with a deep seated distrust of soldiers and standing armies stemming from the Civil War of the seventeenth century, made sport the model for human behaviour. People's actions were shaped by sport, first at school and then in adult life. They were judged by their ability to maintain the standards of a game and fulfil its requirements. Cricket became the approved and national game, "the noblest game," "the English game," "the game of life." Because it was such a serious pursuit, cricketing humour was always derived from an incongruity between the game and society. Politics, the church and marriage were all assessed by the standard of cricket. It is uniquely English that sport, and particularly cricket, should become a narra tive theme in literature and a mea .s of revealing character. Hunting imagery also served the same purpose. You know the nature of a man or woman in Trollope's novels by the way a hedge is taken or stream jumped in the course of the hunt. Often a hunt is used as a deliberate means of avoiding the narrator's exposition of his characters. Burgo Fitzgerald flounders into the mud, which is where life will end for him. Lady Eustace proves her courage and endurance by riding up with the first horses. Trollope reserved cricket for the discussion of politics and marriage. Sport was no longer comic but a matter of high seriousness. Life could be ludicrous when it was measured against the harmony and order of a cricket match. Meredith made cricket the counterpoint to courtship, and in Evan Harrington (1861), the Countess de Saldar plays out her own game against the cricket match at Beckley, and "declares" knowing that she will have a second innings.30 The scene and its comic nuances are unintelligible without a knowledge of the laws of cricket. Nothing reveals the squalid perfidy of Trollope's Countess de Courcy more than her using the image of cricket when she plans to snatch up a betrothed man for her daughter. Her reference to the game is itself profanation: "It was part of the game which was as natural to her as fielding is to a cricketer. One cannot have it all winnings at any game. Whether Crosbie should eventually become her son in-law or not it came to her naturally, as a part of her duty in life, to bowl down the stumps of that young lady at Allington. If Miss Dale knew the game well and could protect her own wicket, let her do so."31 The import is in the last sentence. The duty of a good cricketer is not necessarily to win, but to play well, meaning unselfishly. The comic sporting formula employed by Egan had been completely re versed. Now it was the sport that set the tone and model for life, and not life which was parodied in the sport. Andrew Lang wrote in 1893: "Cricket 30ch. 13. 31The Small House at Allington, 2 vols. (London, 1864), ch. 18.</page><page sequence="10">74 Sporting Humour in Victorian Literature is a very humanizing game. It appeals to the emotions of local patriotism and pride. It is eminently unselfish; the love of it never leaves us, and binds all brethren together, whatever their politics and rank may be. There is nothing like it in the sports of mankind."32 Here the danger is to laugh at episodes and anecdotes that the Victorians did not find amusing. It was natural to preach sermons on cricket, to equate cricket with the national ethos. It is unhistorical on our part, no matter how tempting, to laugh at a source of Victorian spiritual strength. Nothing provoked Punch to greater raillery than women attempting to play any game—other than the one they knew so well, flirting. On only one occasion could a woman show superiority, and that was to an obstreperous child. It was quite permissible for sisters to put younger brothers in their place at the hunt or at tennis. Croquet and its essential purpose was superbly depicted in a cartoon of 1867. Two young ladies of great hauteur rebuke an old man who knowingly puts a finger to his nose. The caption reads: "An Objectionable Old Man. Young Ladies:—Going to make a flower-bed here, Smithers? Why, it'll quite spoil our croquet ground! Gardener:— Well, that's yer pa's orders, Miss! He'll have it laid out for 'Orticultur' not for 'Usbandry.' "33 It was not Punch's singular and misogynistic view. One way of keeping women in their place was to show their inability to comprehend, much less play, a sport. Punch's cricketing correspondent in 1877 was "Kittums," who concluded her account of the Oxford versus Cambridge match at Lord's with the question: " 'But why should a Cambridge man be wanted to keep a wicket at Lord's? Can't a Commissionaire be paid for it as they are at the Aquarium?' "34 It was humour directed at the invasion of a male preserve, and the common attitude was recalled by Leacock who knew that when women played games, the game ceased to be a sport and became another variant of courtship. "All of this sex appeal stuff—having got started on this digression, I hate to leave it—was enormously accelerated by the fact of women breaking into men's games. They not only broke into them but they spoiled them. Lawn tennis came first. They got into that from the start. Back in the eighties and nineties we didn't look on lawn tennis as a game in the real sense. It was just a sissy business on a lawn, played with girls as part of a social afternoon. The real games were football and lacrosse, baseball and cricket. Nobody played tennis well or wanted to; those of us who were six and a half feet high could beat the rest of us. It was just a matter of heights."35 Love, set and matchmaking were the rules of the game, and the Victorian 32Richard Daft, Kings of Cricket, intr.

It was rather like reading novels in church. Sport and the constant references to it changed the language. Surtees's plots are as ramshackle as an abandoned henhouse, but his pages sparkle with lines as brilliant as his own favourite equestrienne, Lucy Glitters. In Mr. Sponge's Sporting Tour (1853), we find die phrase, "having mentioned Mr. Sponge's groomy gait and horsey propensities .. ,"36 and at once we are re minded of Wodehouse and Kingsley Amis. Virginia Woolf had observed this characteristic in her essay on Jack Mytton: "Indeed the English Sporting writers, Beckford, St. John, Surtees, Nim rod make no mean reading. In their slapdash, gentlemanly way they have ridden their pens as boldly as they have ridden their horses. They have had their effect upon the language. This riding and tumbling, this being blown upon and rained upon and splashed from head to heels with mud, have worked themselves into the very texture of English prose and given it that leap and lash, that stripping of images from flying hedge and tossing free which distinguishes it not indeed above the French but so emphatically from it."37 The difference was not so much one of language but the relationship of sport to life. Certain games became moral exemplars for the Victorian. It was never sport that failed to satisfy the body and the spirit, but life. If only life could be a game of cricket, then harmony and peace would prevail in society. That was not humour but possibly one of the more profound Victorian contributions to sociology. It would be far beyond the scope and the stomach of this writer to assess our own society by the sports we play and the humour they evoke.
