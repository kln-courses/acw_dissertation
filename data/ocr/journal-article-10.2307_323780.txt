Then, he comments that "to some extent, the difference between the languages ... is simply a feature of the description" (p. 62). It is not clear why Professor Levenston did not consider utilizing a grammatical model which, rather than beginning with a breakdown of the sentence and working up to the whole sentence, instead starts from the sentence level and procedes to an analysis of its components. It would have been interesting and relevant to look at "base to surface" generative analyses of both English and Hebrew in order to find some of the striking similarities and differences between the two languages. Such an approach, along with helping to locate the important "trees" first, might better meet the author's claims for contrastive linguistics. Professor Levenston has put his major thrust into the sections on grammar. Although the sections on vocabulary represent a much smaller part of the whole work, his comments on contrastive semantic ranges between the two languages contribute much worthwhile material. Teachers should benefit from his diagrams in the chapter on Vocabulary which graphically show how two languages categorize experience differently. By the final chapter, the author has amply guided Israeli teachers into being able to realize for themselves why students frequently make the error in English of saying "hello" when they leave their classrooms. The equivilent Hebrew word, shalom, is used for both greeting and leave-taking. Fraida Dubin University of Southern California Thurber, James. The Unicorn in the Garden and Other Fables for Our Time (TC1348) and The Grizzly and the Gadgets and Further Fables for Our Time (TC1412). Read by Peter Usti- nov. New York: Caedmon Records, Inc., 1972. Two discs. $6.98, each. Thurber's fables endow animals with anthropomorphic characteristics in the best Aesopian tradition. They first appeared in the New Yorker magazine in the late 1930's and were published in book form in two volumes by Harper and Row in 1940 and by Simon and Schuster in 1956. They follow the format "title, text, moral" and have no musical bridges or sound effects other than vocal modulations in imitation of the different characters in some of the dia- logues, including regional and ethnic dialects and foreign accents. The fables are humorous in a very sophisticated way. They abound in puns and near puns (the parrot said "I'm the real macaw," an old wolves' tale), twisted aphorisms (all men kill the thing they hate), parodies (yesterday and yesterday and yesterday, creeps in this carapace from day to day to the first syllable of recorded time), mixed proverbs (finders are not their brothers' keepers), paralleled plays on words (the happy-go-lucky and the gloomy-go-sorry), alliterations (moved in the moist and muddy margins, with monstrous mocking metaphors), antitheses (lives of noisy desperation), witticisms (candy is dandy but liquor is quicker), and assorted moralizations (the hell-bent get where they are going, you might as well fall flat on your face as lean over too far backwards, it is better to have loafed and lost than never to have loafed at all). The two records contain a total of 77 minutes of spoken text divided into 28 segments that range from 1:04 to 4:33 minutes. They are in the rotund and mellifluous voice of Ustinov and are technically excellent. The style is perfor- mance-oriented-careful (the middle syllable of "emerald" is clearly present), formal ("vases" comes out /vaziz/), and typically British ("eat" is pronounced /Et/). These records could possibly be used for teaching English as a second language, but the level of sophistication and the quantity of allusions suggests that an elementary-level application is not recommended. They could be very effective in an advanced class as a comprehension exercise (they would surely command the interest and stretch the ability of students) and as a stimulus for a wide-ranging discussion of American culture in the first half of the twentieth-century.
