(line 12) The Curetes hid [?] the goddess’ infant child in the holy cave 2 secretly from  Cronus of the crooked mind, when blessed Rhea deceived him [sc.  Cronus] 3 and obtained  great honor from the gods. 4 These things he [sc. Cithaeron] sang. And the Muses imme- diately ordered the blessed ones to cast their secret votes in gold-shining urns, and they all  rose together. Cithaeron obtained more votes; immediately Hermes proclaimed him [vic- tor], crying out that he had won the desired victory . . . with garlands . . . the blessed ones  adorned [him]; and his mind rejoiced. But the other one, Helicon, in the grip of terrible  sorrow moved [?] toward a smooth cliff, [and] the mountain . . . ; crying [?] pitifully, he  cast himself from up high with countless stones . . . P mg 654, preserVed in P.Berol. 13284 (251 M-p3), narrates the singing contest between the two Boeotian mountains, Helicon and Cithaeron. despite the poem’s fragmentary state, we can nevertheless discern  a good part of its plot. The second mountain, in all likelihood Cithaeron, 5  sings of Rhea’s trick to steal the newborn Zeus and hide him in a cave where  he is raised by the Curetes. This action leads to her (or Zeus’?) great honor.  Thereafter, the Muses bid the gods, who serve as the jury, to cast their secret  votes in golden urns. Cithaeron is the winner and rejoices, while Helicon in  his grief hurls himself down from the mountain. in this article, i focus on two problems raised by Cithaeron’s victorious  song: (1) while it shows verbal similarities with Hesiod’s account of Zeus’  birth in the Theogony, it also diverges from it significantly, since it introduces  the Cretan Curetes who are not even hinted at in the Theogony; and (2) the  victor is not Helicon, the mountain most closely associated with Hesiod and  the Muses, but Cithaeron, a mountain linked to local Boeotian stories. i sug- gest that the contest between the two mountains has theogonic song as its  subject matter: 6 the winner prevails with a modification of an episode nar- rated in Hesiod’s Theogony, and we may surmise that Helicon, the mountain  intimately related to Hesiod and his Theogony, narrated a theogonic song  that did not diverge from the Hesiodic narrative. Cithaeron’s song in PMG  654 then alludes to the great master of the past, while introducing material  from other sources. But Corinna is not the only poet to treat Hesiod’s poetry  in this manner: as a parallel for this procedure we can cite the Theogony  attri buted to epimenides of Crete, who followed a similar process and with  whose work Corinna may have been familiar (this last point is intimately  2. After re-examining the Berlin papyrus, West (1996, 22) does not read an acute over δαθι[; this allows  for a dative δαθίοι modifying ἄντροι; otherwise we would render “The Curetes hid [?] the goddess’ divine babe  in the cave. . . .” 3. Gerber (1970, 396) considers “deceive” “rather flat” after λαθράδαν, and accordingly renders “when  Rheia stole him . . .” (sc. Zeus). 4. it is also conceivable that the subject of ἕλε is Zeus. 5. page (1963, 20 n. 3) remarks: “Wilamowitz chose Cithaeron, and posterity repeats it; i do not know  why.” Arguments for attributing the second (and winning) song to Cithaeron are presented in Bolling (1956,  283 n. 1) and Weiler (1974, 82 n. 189), who point out that in an ἀγὼν λόγων the winning contestant regu- larly speaks second. Weiler also adds that Cithaeron’s song contains themes that are more pleasing to the  gods; hence he wins the jury’s favor. For further arguments for the identification of the second contestant as  Cithaeron, see Rocchi 1989, 309–24; Burzacchini 1990; and larmour 2005, 37–39. 6.  .....]χ̣ορδᾱ ́ς ̣of line 4 suggests that the singer is accompanied by a stringed instrument like an epic bard. </page> <page sequence="3"> corinnA’s poetic MountAins 103 linked to Corinna’s date, which i discuss below, pp. 112–14). The treatment  of Typhoeus in pindar’s Pythian 1 offers another (brief) parallel for such  Hesiodic imitation with variation. 7 Corinna thus creatively engages with her  Boeotian poetic source: in combining epichoric traditions with panhellenic  (i.e., Hesiodic) elements, she can be viewed as a poetess who exemplifies  a tradition of revising, adapting, or commenting on Hesiod. in a way, the  contest between the two Boeotian mountains parallels the “contest” between  the two Boeotian poets. it may be objected that the fragmentary state of Corinna’s contest-poem  does not allow such conclusions. But we need to view this problem from the  proper perspective. The departures from Hesiod discussed here are found in  a reported song, of which only six lines are preserved (lines 12–18). Though  few, these verses show incontestable verbal similarities to Hesiod’s version  (listed below, pp. 107–9). Corinna’s departures from Hesiod’s version thus  acquire special prominence amid the dense network of Hesiodic references. The views espoused here are opposed to a great part of modern scholarship  on Corinna, which views her as a “parochial versifier.” The general evaluation  of her literary output tends to be negative. For example, denys page spoke of  the “simple and rough-hewn characters” in Corinna’s poetry and judged “her  narratives rather dull and childish, and herself lacking the force of intellect  and character to inspire them with life and interest.” 8 scholars even spoke of  old wives’ tales as the subject matter of her poetry, an idea that stems from  the misunderstanding of ϝεροῖ(α) at PMG 655. 9 derek Collins and david  Berman are notable recent exceptions to this trend. 10 it will also be good to  remember that the appreciation of Corinna in antiquity was far higher than  in modern times. in complimenting his girlfriend, propertius compared her  poems to those of Corinna (et sua cum antiquae committit scripta Corinnae /  carminaque Erinnae non putat aequa suis, “and she likens her own writings  with those of ancient Corinna and does not consider erinna’s poems equal to  her own,” 2.3.21–22), while ovid chose Corinna as the name of the woman  to whom his poetry was devoted. More important, statius’ father was teaching  Corinna’s poems in naples (Silv. 5.156–58):  tu pandere doctus carmina Battiadae latebrasque lycophronis atri sophronaque implicitum tenuisque arcana Corinnae. You were skilled at explaining the poems of Battus’ grandson and the secrets of dark   lycophron and convoluted sophron and the hidden secrets of fine Corinna. 7. The most striking example of a poet’s critical engagement with a story’s treatment by an authorita- tive poetic voice of the past, accompanied by a refutation of that earlier treatment, is stesichorus’ palinode  (PMG 192). stesichorus, however, is very explicit in his critical stance (οὐκ ἔστ ̓ ἔτυμος λόγος οὗτος), whereas  Corinna’s technique in PMG 654 is more indirect and subtle. 8. page 1963, 76. This view has now been successfully challenged by Collins 2006. 9. PMG 655 is preserved in P.Oxy. XXiii 2370, where the digamma is visible. Hephaestion Enchiridion  16.3, p. 56, preserves the same poem with γέροια instead of ϝεροῖα, while Antoninus liberalis 25 lists the  title of this poem as γεροίων. Hansen (1989) links ϝερῷα (as it should be properly spelled) to sanskrit vīrayú  (heroic, bold; cf. latin vir). 10. Collins 2006; Berman 2010. </page> <page sequence="4"> 104 AthAnAssios VergAdos Corinna is grouped in statius’ “syllabus” together with poets whose work was  notoriously difficult to grasp. 11 Characteristically, statius accumulates four  terms that indicate the demand these poets’ work placed on its interpreters  (latebras, atri, implicitum, and arcana), and it is noteworthy that he attributes  to Corinna both arcana, which implies the presence of hidden meanings in her  verses, as well as the term tenuis, a catchword hinting at Hellenistic leptotês. 12 it is perhaps characteristic of Corinna’s tenuitas (besides the fragmentary  state in which her poetry has reached us) that modern scholarship has been  unable to reach agreement on several issues regarding her life and work.  Corinna’s date has been debated, with some scholars following the ancient  tradition that synchronized her with pindar, while others consider her to be  Hellenistic. The way she presents her narratives has led some to view her as  an exponent of genuine Archaic naïveté, while others regard her poetry as  exhibiting Hellenistic pseudo-naïveté. 13 studying Corinna from the perspec- tive of gender has not led to unanimous conclusions either. Marilyn skinner,  for instance, observed how much Corinna differs from sappho and pointed out  that in PMG 654 she presents the myth of Rhea’s trick from the patriarchal  perspective, having “fully internalized male values.” 14 Reacting to this ap- proach, diane Rayor proposed that Corinna composed, like sappho, “women- identified” poetry that “repossesses” the tradition and is directed to a female  audience. 15 An example of such “repossession” of the tradition is precisely  PMG 654 since the focus of the victorious song appears to be on Rhea and  her trick. 16 Be that as it may, Rayor’s point that Corinna’s “mythological nar- ratives are new versions of traditional tales, which is a form of competition”  is nevertheless valid. 17 The competitive aspect of Corinna’s poem on the singing contest between  Cithaeron and Helicon is the focus of dee Clayman’s contribution. 18 Begin- ning from the ancient evidence for a contest between pindar and Corinna, 19  Clayman reads the poem as an allegory in which Corinna (= Cithaeron) de- feats Helicon, who represents pindar’s poetry. Clayman is inspired by Calli- 11. Mcnelis (2002, 82–83) offers the most comprehensive recent overview of ancient scholarship on  Corinna. 12. Alexander polyhistor composed a commentary on Corinna’s works, as the scholiast on Apollonius  Rhodius’ Argonautica 1.551 transmits; cf. FGrH 273 F 97. Antipater of Thessalonike (Anth. Pal. 9.26 = Gow– page GP 179–89) praised Corinna as one of the nine Muses on earth. 13. davies (1988, 188) cites an anecdote concerning the misunderstanding that arose between two eminent  philologists (one of whom was hard of hearing): they agreed that Corinna’s poetry displays both genuine  Archaic naïveté as well as Hellenistic pseudo-naïveté. 14. skinner 1983, 14–15. such perceptions have, of course, been used as dating criteria: thus, for skinner  “Corinna is the product of Hellenistic unisex education.” 15. Rayor 1993. Corinna’s audience was certainly not exclusively female. Although at PMG 655.1–3 (a  poem often considered programmatic, perhaps wrongly) she seems to have a female audience in mind (ἐπί με  Τερψιχόρα [. . . / καλὰ ϝεροῖ ̓ ἀισομέναν / Ταναγρίδεσσι λευκοπέπλυς, “Terpsichore [bids?] me to sing beauti- ful narratives to the white-clad Tanagran women”), she immediately goes on to emphasize the public aspect  of her performance at which the polis, i.e., a male audience as well, rejoices (μέγα δ ̓ ἐμῆς γεγάθι πόλις /  λιγουροκωτίλυς ἐνοπῆς, “and my city has greatly rejoiced with my sweet, enchanting songs”); on this issue, see  palumbo stracca 1993, 405–6. 16. Rayor 1993, 224. 17. Rayor 1993, 229. Corinna’s contest-poem illustrates the competitive aspect of Greek lyric in terms of  both its possible performance in competitions and its dialogue with poets of the past. 18. Clayman 1993. 19. Ael. VH 13.25; paus. 9.22.3; Suda κ 2087. plut. Mor. 347f–8a and Σ on Ar.

Here, i propose to use a different strat- egy, namely to consider the subject matter of Cithaeron’s winning song and to  account for the reason Cithaeron wins. This approach will highlight Corinna’s  treatment of her Hesiodic model and contextualize her poetic response to the  Hesiodic original. 1. Helicon and Cithaeron in other sources While the eris between the two characters is known from other sources,   nowhere else does it assume the form of a singing contest. And, more im- portant, Helicon is always viewed in a positive light, whereas Cithaeron is  consistently the evildoer. 23 Hermesianax of Cyprus (FGrH 797 F 2) transmits  the following: Helicon and Cithaeron, though brothers, had different dispositions. For Helicon, be- ing milder and gentle, cherished his old parents with kind feelings; but Cithaeron, being  greedy and wishing to transfer their fortune to himself, first killed his father, then set an  ambush to his brother and threw him off a cliff and was carried down together with him.  due to the gods’ providence they were transformed into the homonymous mountains. on  account of his lack of respect, Cithaeron became the lair of the erinyes, whereas Helicon  became the dwelling-place of the Muses because of his affectionate disposition. 24 less informative and of doubtful value is a notice traced back to deme- trius of phalerum and transmitted by scholia eHMQR on Odyssey 3.267 that  Automedes of Mycenae first wrote an epic poem about the strife of Helicon  and Cithaeron. 25 Corinna’s fragment does not allow us to determine with  certainty whether the two characters were brothers. However, this relation  20. Clayman 1993, 636. 21. The differences between Corinna’s poetry and pindaric epinician are explored in larmour 2005,  39–48. 22. pindar’s Vita 1.1.6–9 transmits a notice, traced back to Chamaeleon and istrus, that links pindar with  Helicon; this is, of course, of little historical value. 23. see Burzacchini 1990, 31–32. 24. The association of Cithaeron with the erinyes appears also in [leon of Byzantium] FGrH 132 F 2. 25. see page 1963, 21; Weiler 1974, 81. A scholion on Hes. Op. 1 (p. 29, lines 199–202 Gaisford) also  transmits the strife between the two brothers. </page> <page sequence="6"> 106 AthAnAssios VergAdos may be hinted at in the choice of topic for Cithaeron’s song: it is a story about  another case of mythological strife within the family, that is, what is usually  called the “succession Myth,” the story of a son’s violent displacement of his  father (here we may recall that Cithaeron was said to have killed his father)  and a wife’s deception of her husband. Corinna’s translation of the antagonism between Helicon and Cithaeron  into a singing contest is understandable. Both mountains are somehow linked  with the Muses, perhaps through rival cults. Helicon’s claim to fame lies  mainly in Hesiod’s Dichterweihe, his poetry that achieved panhellenic status,  and in its cult of the Muses, while Cithaeron is important for the Boeotian  legends associated with it, stories that became the subject matter of tragedy.  Helicon was the mountain where the Muses appeared to Hesiod (Hes. Theog.  22–34) and introduced him to poetry. 26 By extension, Helicon can be viewed  as synonymous with Hesiodic poetry. 27 The cult of the Muses on Helicon is  well-documented and also involved a festival, the Mouseia. 28 Cithaeron, on the other hand, is associated with tragedy and with local  Theban lore. 29 it was the mountain where oedipus was exposed as an infant,  and it was there that the Theban hero wanted to return after his self-blinding. 30  Cithaeron was also the mountain where the Bacchants practiced their rites. in  euripides’ Bacchae it is on Cithaeron that Agave and her sisters, performing  a dionysiac sparagmos, kill pentheus. The same mountain was the stage for  the drama of Antiope, Amphion, and Zethos, 31 and it was there that Heracles  performed his first exploit. 32 The same mountain was the locus of Actaeon’s  wretched death. 33 Finally, just as Helicon was the site of a cult of the Muses,  26. For the relation of Helicon to the Muses, see schachter 1986, 147–49; Hes. Op. 658–59; pind. Isthm.  2.34, 8.57; eur. HF 791. 27. The relation between Helicon, the Muses, and Hesiod is recorded in IG Vii 4240.5–6 (Thespiae). in  addition, IG Vii 1785 points to the existence of a joint cult of Hesiod and the Muses in Thespiae. see Hender- son 1995, 29–30 with 36 n. 6. paus. 9.30.3 transmits that a statue of Hesiod existed in the agora of Thespiae. 28. For the cult of the Muses at Helicon, see Roscher 1894–97, col. 3239–40; paus. 9.29; IG Vii 1795  (earlier than mid-third century), 1796 (second/first century). Argoud (1996, 32–42) presents several passages  (mainly from the Greek Anthology) that link the Muses to Helicon. For the Mouseia that featured competi- tions in dithyramb, tragedy, and comedy, see plut. Mor. 748f; Fiehn 1937, col. 45–47; Roux 1954; schachter  1986, 163–79; Knoepfler 1996. no information on the Mouseia is earlier than the last quarter of the fourth  century, and it seems that they were reorganized toward the end of the third century with financial support  from non-Boeotian rulers. There is also evidence that non-Boeotian guilds (isthmian, nemean, and Athenian)  were attracted to this festival; see IG Vii 1735B.5–9, where it is stated that the Athenian victors at the Mouseia  would enjoy the same privileges as the victors at the pythian games. Victor lists have been preserved in the  inscriptional record (e.g., IG Vii 1760, first century, which also lists the name of the Muses’ priest). There  is a piece of evidence that may go back to the fourth century, an epigram for a dithyrambic victory cited by  Amphion of Thespiae, FGrH 387 F 1; see schachter 1986, 158 with n. 2 for the date. 29. i agree with Burzacchini (1990, 33–34) that Cithaeron was “never felt as a symbol of ‘local poetry,’”  and therefore argue only that it was Boeotian lore (i.e., local traditions) that was associated with Cithaeron.  some of these mythological traditions provided material for Athenian tragedies, a poetic genre that one would  hardly consider local poetry. 30. see Vivante (1979, 84), who points out that “in sophokles’ Oidipous Tyrannos Mount Kithairon is  often mentioned as if it were aware of oidipous,” citing soph. OT 1089–91, 1391–92, and 1451; cf. also eur.  Phoen. 1604–7, and see further Burzacchini 1990, 31–32 nn. 1–2. 31. see Gantz 1993, 485–86. 32. see Gantz 1993, 379. 33. see Buxton 1992, 6; and 8 n. 71 on Cithaeron as the site of oedipus’ and Amphion and Zethus’ expo- sure, as well as pp. 12–13 on Cithaeron as tragic (dionysiac) space. note, too, that Cithaeron is depicted as an  observer of Actaeon’s fate at LIMC 6.1, s.v. Kithairon (nos. 1–4). in fact, all the representations of Cithaeron  listed in LIMC are tied to Actaeon’s story. However, nos. 2 and 3 are late (second century c.e.), while no. 1  </page> <page sequence="7"> corinnA’s poetic MountAins 107 Cithaeron may have been the location of a cult of Mnemosyne. Hesiod Theog- ony 54 (Μνημοσύνη, γουνοῖσιν Ἐλευθῆρος μεδέουσα) could imply such a cult  there (i.e., at the hills of eleuther on Cithaeron). 34 The opposing character of these two mountains is reflected in Callimachus’  Hymn 5. There Teiresias is blinded after accidentally seeing Athena bathing at  the Hippocrene on Mount Helicon. Athena justifies this punishment by evok- ing Cronus’ laws and the Fates. But in exchange for his blinding, Teiresias  receives from the goddess the ability to prophesy (123–26), a staff (βάκτρον)  with which to feel his way, and longevity. The first two gifts can be paralleled  by the gifts Hesiod receives from the Muses in the proem of his Theogony: a  staff of laurel (σκῆπτρον . . . δάφνης, 30–31, here a sign of poetic authority)  and the ability to sing τά τ ̓ ἐσσόμενα πρό τ ̓ ἐόντα (31–32; cf. 38 and Hom. Il.  1.70, where τά τ ̓ ἐόντα τά τ ̓ ἐσσόμενα πρό τ ̓ ἐόντα is the knowledge the seer  Calchas possesses). Just as Teiresias’ viewing of Athena takes place on Heli- con, so too does the encounter between the Muses and Hesiod, who mentions  the Hippocrene as one of their favorite haunts at Theogony 6. significantly,  Athena prefaces the blessings she bestows on Teiresias with a prophecy of  Actaeon’s fate: just as Teiresias, he is a young hunter who accidentally will  see a virgin goddess bathing, but will meet a gruesome end, killed by his own  hunting dogs. Characteristically, this will occur on Cithaeron (Callim. Hymn  5.107–16). Thus the outcome of two almost identical stories seems to be  predicated by the character of the mountain that functions as the stage where  these stories unfold. 2. PMG 654 and Hesiod in view of the above discussion, a poetic contest is not an inappropriate repre- sentation of the antagonism between Helicon and Cithaeron. But it is surpris- ing that in Corinna’s poem Hesiod’s Helicon loses the contest to Cithaeron’s  essentially Hesiodic song. 35 Corinna’s assumed parochialism does not provide  an adequate explanation for this frustration of audience expectations, since  is a lost or imaginary depiction, described by philostr. Imag. 1.14.4; but no. 4, which dates from around 460,  represents Cithaeron as a messenger announcing Actaeon’s fate, a reference to Aeschylus’ lost play Toxotides  (TGrF frags. 241–46); cf. Kanavou 2010, 6. 34. see West (1966, 174–75), who acknowledges the possibility that “the existence of rival Muse-cults  on Helicon and Cithaeron may have some connection with the legend of the singing-contest between the two  mountains described by Corinna.” The evidence for the cult of Mnemosyne on Mount Cithaeron in schachter  (1986, 144–45) is essentially based on West’s note. The fact that Cithaeron was the site of the daedala festival  (in honor of Hera and Zeus) may provide an additional reason for the reference to Zeus in Cithaeron’s song;  see paus. 9.3.1–2 and larmour 2005, 37–39. This festival celebrated the reconciliation of Zeus and Hera (a  ἱερὸς γάμος). larmour detects an analogy between Rhea’s trick (the subject matter of Cithaeron’s song) and  the trick suggested to Zeus by King Cithaeron. note, too, pausanias’ remarks on Hera’s temple at plataea  (9.2.7). 35. For the reasons indicated in n. 5 above, i am assuming throughout this paper that the second song in  Corinna’s contest-poem (i.e., the part of a theogonic poem with Hesiodic references) is Cithaeron’s. on the  basis of Corinna’s mythological innovations, one might conceivably argue that she departed from the usual  arrangement of an ἀγὼν λόγων, in which the winner delivers his song or speech second. in that case, the  preserved song would belong to Helicon. such a procedure might make sense in view of the expectation that a  theogonic song containing Hesiodic allusions would be performed by Helicon, but this would not be without  problems. For instead of a Corinna who creatively elaborates on (or modifies) the Hesiodic tradition of theo- gonic song, we would have a poetess who outright rejects that tradition, since its exponent not only loses in the  song contest, but does not even take his defeat well. </page> <page sequence="8"> 108 AthAnAssios VergAdos both mountains are Boeotian. We need to look for a different way to account  for Cithaeron’s victory over Helicon. Corinna was certainly familiar with Hesiod’s poetry. in addition to both   poets being Boeotian, there are verbal echoes of Hesiod’s Theogony in Corin- na’s contest-poem, which have already been pointed out by previous schol- ars. 36 Thus, we may compare δαθίοι θιᾶς βρέφος ἄντροι with Hesiod Theogony  483, ἄντρῳ ἐν ἠλιβάτῳ, ζαθέης ὑπὸ κεύθεσι γαίης (“in an abysmal cave, in  the depths of the holy earth”). 37 μεγάλαν ἀθανάτων ἔσς ἕλε τιμάν is reminis- cent of Hesiod Theogony 462, ἐν ἀθανάτοισιν ἔχοι βασιληίδα τιμήν (“so that  he might hold the kingly honor among the immortals”), while ἀγκυλομήταο  Κρόνω recalls the frequent epic formula Κ ρόνος ἀγκυλομήτης (“crook-minded  Cronus”; cf. Hes. Theog. 473 and 495). one may also see a reminiscence of  Hesiod in λαθράδαν (cf. Hes. Theog. 471 λελάθοιτο, in a section where Rhea  asks her parents for advice on how she might give birth to Zeus unbeknownst  to Cronus). But despite these verbal similarities, Corinna’s contest-poem departs from  Hesiod in a number of ways. At lines 19–22, the Muses are presented as  impartial overseers of the contest and are thus dissociated from Helicon. The  poetess combines the musical with the courtroom agôn. 38 The two contestants  compete in song, and a panel of divine judges are asked by the Muses to cast  their secret vote; these votes are counted and reveal that Cithaeron is the win- ner, whose name is appropriately announced by the κῆρυξ, Hermes. But it is  particularly noteworthy that the Muses are not judging the contest themselves,  even though singing belongs to their sphere; 39 instead, they limit themselves  to overseeing the process. This is especially striking since the Muses func- tion as judges in musical contests elsewhere: they are said to have judged the  musical contest between Apollo and Marsyas, 40 while the chorus of Aristo- phanes Ranae 875–81 invites them to judge the contest between  Aeschylus  and euripides (though in the end it is dionysus who decides between the  two poets). The fact that the Muses do not judge the contest themselves, but  instead preside over a panel of judges (thus acting as the ἀγωνάρχαι) under- scores their distance from Helicon, whom we would expect them to support,  and from whatever form of poetry this mountain symbolizes. 41 36. see page 1963, 20 n. 5 and Burzacchini 1991, 66 and 71–72. 37. depending on the supplement at line 13 ἔκρουψαν (lobel) or ἔθρεψαν (page 1963, 19), we may have  another correspondence with Hesiod’s text (line 482). Whichever verb we supply, the Curetes are the subject  instead of Hesiod’s Rhea. For δάθιον, see n. 2 above. 38. see segal (1975, 2), who speaks of “precise dicaeastic particularity” and provides detailed parallels  from the judicial procedure; see also Henderson 1995, 34. 39. For the relation of the Muses and singing, see Hes. Theog. 6–10; eur. Hel. 1345, HF 685–86. The  Muses are often represented as a chorus directed by Apollo; cf. Hom. Il. 1.604; [Hes.] Sc. 202–6; Hymn. Hom.  Merc. 450–52; pind. Pyth. 1.6–12, Nem. 5.22–25; eur. Ion 881–84. 40. Weiler (1974, 57) mentions other characters who were said to have acted as the judges of this contest  instead of the Muses (Athena, Midas, the nysaeans, or Mount Tmolus). For artistic representations of the  Muses as judges in the contest between Apollo and Marsyas, see LIMC 6.1, s.v. Mousa, Mousai, nos. 101–19  (with commentary on p. 677); see also no. 96 (ca. 410, where Thamyris and Mousaios are present), in which  the Muses may also be acting as judges. 41. Thus the statement in Henderson (1995, 34) that “there is nothing strange in the Muses and the gods  officiating in Corinna’s conception of the mythical contest” is not entirely accurate. </page> <page sequence="9"> corinnA’s poetic MountAins 109 Another point where Corinna departs from Hesiod’s account is the presence  of the Curetes. 42 in fact, the Curetes are nowhere mentioned in the Theogony,  which does not include any nymphs or other characters as attendants of Zeus  during his childhood. 43 Although their cult is attested outside of Crete, they  do not seem to have been worshipped in Boeotia. 44 They may have been men- tioned by eumelus in relation to the story of Zeus’ birth (eighth century?), 45  and this would give us a rough date for the earliest attestation of the Curetes- motif in Zeus’ infancy story some where in the late eighth century. But already  in the fifth century, the Curetes had been conflated with Bacchic cult figures,  and as a result they could be linked to Boeotia, and more specifically to  Cithaeron in whose song they appear. euripides (Bacch. 120–34) provides  evidence for this conflation of the Cretan Curetes, the Corybantes, and Bac- chic cult figures. This euripidean passage has, furthermore, some similarities  with Corinna’s contest-poem, as page, following dodds, points out, 46 and in  his view Corinna, “a parochial versifier who had already been forgotten by  everybody else for the greater part of a century,” had imitated euripides rather  than vice versa. However, Collins has convincingly argued that instead of  positing a relation of direct dependence between Corinna and euripides, it is  conceivable that both poets may be looking back to Hesiod. This is a distinct  possibility for euripides, since as Collins observes, Bacchae 128–29 (ματρὸς   ̔Ρέας ἐς χέρα θῆκαν, “they placed into the hand of mother Rhea”) seems to be  a reminiscence of Hesiod Theogony 482 (ἑ [= Rhea] χερσὶ λαβοῦσα). 47 The  Curetes and the dionysiac cult are mentioned in the same breath in a fragment  of euripides’ Cretans (TrGF frag. 472.9–15). This conflation or identification  of the Curetes with the followers of dionysus provides a link between the  Curetes and Cithaeron and may have inspired Corinna to introduce the Cretan  Curetes into Cithaeron’s song. 3. some parallel Cases: epimenides and pindar The combination of Hesiodic with non-Hesiodic material in a song with theo- gonic subject is not unique to Corinna. An interesting parallel is the Theogony  42. To my knowledge, only Burzacchini (1991, 70) has questioned the reading Κώρειτες at lines 12–13.  But Kώ is legible on the papyrus, as is η (corrected from ει), while traces of a ρ are visible; -ψαν in the follow- ing line requires a plural subject, and in the context of Zeus’ birth the Curetes are the most likely candidates;  cf. also page’s apparatus in PMG p. 332. 43. The Curetes are mentioned in [Hes.] frag. 123.3 (= strabo 10.3.19). 44. see schwenn 1922. 45.  Johannes lydus, De mensibus 4.71 transmits that eumelus had localized the birth of Zeus in lydia and  adds that the Curetes were his guardians. But the relevance of this notice to Corinna’s Curetes is limited: it is  uncertain whether Zeus was hidden in a cave according to Johannes lydus’ notice, while the scanty remains of  Corinna do not clarify which cave she meant. An additional problem is caused by the fact that the Curetes were  often confused with the Corybantes, who were the attendants of the Magna Mater. note that Phoronis frag.  3 W (= strabo 10.3.19) places the Curetes in phrygia, while the poet of Danais frag. 3 W (= philodemus De  pietate B 5818 obbink) adds that they were the attendants of the mother of the gods. But generally the Curetes  were regarded as Cretan; cf. Gantz 1993, 147–48. 46. see page 1963, 20–21 n. 5: eur.

West as the earliest witness  for the Curetes-motif in Zeus’s Cretan birth-story (but see above, p. 109 with  n. 45 on eumelus). 48 As far as we can judge from the scanty remains of  his Theogony, epimenides’ poem had considerable similarities with Hesiod’s  Theogony. The poem’s very title, “Hymn to the Curetes or Corybantes and  Theogony,” 49 suggests an arrangement similar to that of Hesiod’s Theogony:  just as Hesiod began his poem with a hymn to the Heliconian and olympian  Muses that leads into the theogony proper, epimenides as a Cretan might have  prefaced his theogony with a hymn to the Curetes. 50 in addition, Hesiod ac- quired his poetic wisdom in a supernatural manner through his encounter with  the Muses on Mount Helicon. likewise, epimenides claimed to have slept in  a cave for fifty-seven years and that during his dream he encountered Truth  and Justice, who imparted to him some special knowledge, not unlike that  acquired by Hesiod through the Muses’ epiphany. 51 That this similarity is not  merely a reflex of the motifs commonly found in a scene of divine inspiration  is shown by the way the goddesses addressed epimenides (FGrH 457 F 2): Κρῆτες ἀεὶ ψεῦσται, κακὰ θηρία, γαστέρες ἀργαί, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle bellies a clear reference to Hesiod Theogony 26: ποιμένες ἄγραυλοι, κάκ ̓ ἐλέγχεα, γαστέρες οἶον. 52 field-dwelling shepherds, base reproaches, mere bellies. Hesiod’s verse comes directly before the Muses’ affirmation that they are  capable of both lies and truth. The problem of the song’s truthfulness is  also raised in epimenides. Was his Theogony a “false” story coming from  a Cretan? 53 or did it form an exception, since the knowledge was imparted  to epimenides through a supernatural visitation during his miraculous dream  and because the poet was not given over to his γαστήρ? 54 Aristotle, moreover,  transmits that epimenides did not prophesy about the future, but only about  events of the past, which suggests yet another (partial) link with Hesiod’s  Theogony. 55 epimenides, like Corinna, appears to have mixed Hesiodic with  48. see West (1990, 555) who dates the poem to 430. note, however, that the core of the traditions associ- ated with epimenides must have been current in the sixth century, as Mele (2001, 241) and Brillante (2004,  18) show: the tradition of epimenides’ longevity (and by implication also his dream) is attested already in  Xenophanes; cf. FGrH 457 T 1.20–21. 49. Cf. diog. laert. 1.112 who draws his information from a work Περὶ ποιητῶν by lobon of Argos:  ἐποίησε δὲ Κουρήτων καὶ Κορυβάντων γένεσιν καὶ θεογονίαν, ἔπη πεντακισχίλια. 50. Breglia pulci doria (2001, 289), proposes that epimenides may have concluded his theogony with a  catalogue, just as Hesiod’s Theogony leads into the Catalogue of Women. 51. see FGrH 457 T 4f; cf. also T 1. 52. see leclerc (1992, 227), Brillante (2004, 16–18), and Mele (2001, 236–39), all of whom emphasize  the similar structure of the two verses: they both contain three cola of similar scansion, and they both engage  in a dialogue with other poetic traditions: epimenides refers to Hesiod, while Hesiod refers to the odyssean  tradition or heroic epic in general. 53. Arrighetti (2001, 223) suggests that the deities who represent an “olympian” theology are possibly  warning against an older form of religious belief (Cretan); but this does not preclude the Cretan “coloring” of  the epimenidean theogony. 54. in plut. Mor. 157d–8a, it is said that epimenides followed a special diet, which he had learned from  Hesiod. According to FGrH 457 T 1.35–36, epimenides had received special nourishment from the Muses; cf.  also Brillante 2004, 23. 55. see FGrH 457 F 1 (= Arist. Rh. 1418a21); cf. Hom. Il. 1.69–70. The Muses bid Hesiod sing τά τ ̓  ἐσσόμενα πρό τ ̓ ἐόντα, which partly parallels their own knowledge of τά τ ̓ ἐόντα τά τ ̓ ἐσσόμενα πρό  </page> <page sequence="11"> corinnA’s poetic MountAins 111 non-Hesiodic motifs. He alluded to Hesiod both in verbal and thematic terms,  as we have seen, but included other material as well: philosophical ideas  (Anaximenes’ Ἀήρ), orphic doctrine (the primacy of night and the theme of  the cosmic egg), and Cretan lore (e.g., the Curetes). 56 Corinna’s weaving of Hesiodic with non-Hesiodic material in PMG 654  can also be paralleled by pindar’s Pythian 1, and more specifically by the  portrayal of Typhoeus at lines 15–20. 57 pindar introduces Typhoeus in   Pythian 1.15–16 by evoking the Theogony, but then departs from Hesiod’s  narrative and focuses instead on Aetna and Typhoeus’ present condition.  While T yphoeus’ birthplace in Cilicia and his imprisonment in sicily, where  he is still actively causing volcanic eruptions, are markedly non-Hesiodic  elements, 58 the portrayal of Typhoeus as having one hundred heads and his  incarceration in Tartarus depend on Hesiod’s account in the Theogony. 59 The  reason for this combination of Hesiodic and non-Hesiodic elements is to be  sought in the identity of pindar’s laudandus, Hieron. The tyrant was cele- brated as Αἰτναῖος after his pythian victory, as he had re-established the city  of Aetna after his expulsion of the previous inhabitants and the introduction  of a new citizen body of doric extraction (see line 31, κλεινὸς οἰκιστήρ, “the  renowned founder”). By alluding to Hesiod’s Typhoeus, pindar invests Aetna  with a mythological significance that has a bearing on the present state of  affairs in two ways: the region’s volcanic activity is attributed to this mytho- logical monster that is constantly present in the area, while the poet promotes  Hieron’s political agenda. Aetna becomes a vivid manifestation of Zeus’ vic- tory that is paralleled by Hieron’s own military success: Hieron’s victory  against the etruscans at Cumae (at 474) is implicitly likened to Zeus’ victory  over the last θεῶν πολέμιος (“enemy of the gods”). The innovative combination of material from different traditions posited  here is also attested elsewhere in Corinna’s poetry. PMG 672 (= schol. eur.  Phoen. 26) notes regarding the hunt of the Teumesian fox: τινὲς δὲ καὶ τὴν μητέρα αὐτῷ [sc. Οἰδίποδι] φασιν ἀνῃρῆσθαι. ἀνελεῖν δὲ αὐτὸν οὐ μόνον  τὴν Σφίγγα ἀλλὰ καὶ τὴν Τευμησίαν ἀλώπεκα, ὡς Κόριννα. And some say that his mother too was killed by him [sc. oedipus]; and that he killed not  only the sphinx but also the Teumesian fox, as Corinna says. τ ̓ ἐόντα (Theog. 32); also pl. Leg. 677e. it is characteristic that epimenides’ Theogony was probably also  called Χρησμοί (oracles); cf. Breglia pulci doria 2001, 289. Brillante (2004, 28) points out that contrary to  a  Homeric bard, whose knowledge derived from hearsay (cf. Hom. Il. 2.486), epimenides possessed the art  of mantikê, as well as the art of poetry; this fact, in conjunction with epimenides’ unusual experience (the  fifty-seven-year sleep), accounts for his possessing direct knowledge, as opposed to the epic bard who relied  on the aid of the Muses. 56.

Corinna thus emerges as a poetess who combines or adapts mythological  material in response to her contemporary political situation. 62 The blending of various local elements is evident also in Corinna’s  Asopides fragment (PMG 654 col. ii 13–iv 52). There, too, the narrative is  concerned with Boeotian lore. We hear of Hyrieus and orion, as well as of  Asopus and his daughters, who were abducted by Zeus, poseidon, Apollo,  and Hermes. Although most of Asopus’ daughters are eponyms of Boeotian  locations (Thebe, plataea, Thespia, Tanagra), some lie outside the Boeotian  world (Aegina, Corcyra, salamis, Chalcis, sinope). 63 As daniel Berman has  aptly remarked: “The nymphs’ names serve to insert a solidly Boiotian story  into the larger system of Greek foundation myth.” 64 put another way, the  Asopides function as links that connect the Boeotian center with other areas  in the Hellenic world, thus setting Boeotian lore into panhellenic currency. 4. The problem of Corinna’s date But could Corinna have been familiar with epimenides’ Theogony and hence  have inserted the Cretan Curetes into her narrative, influenced by the Cretan  poet? This issue is tied inextricably with the problem of both poets’ dates. The  Vita by diogenes laertius presents epimenides as a contemporary of solon,  but plato (Leg. 642e) notes that the Cretan sage had visited Athens ten years  before the persian Wars (i.e., around 500). For West, on the other hand, the  Theogony that circulated in Athens under epimenides’ name was composed  around 430. But we have seen above (n. 48) that some of the traditions regard- ing epimenides go back as far as the sixth century. The date of Corinna, too, is an especially debated question. The ancient  tradition presents her as a contemporary of pindar, whom she is said to have  advised on the use of myth; the two poets, it is also said, competed against  each other, with Corinna defeating pindar once (or even five times). Modern  scholars, however, are divided: some follow the traditional dating, sometime  in the fifth century, while others settle for a lower date around 200. The lat- ter view is based on metrical and linguistic criteria, which are notoriously  slippery. 65 The spelling of Corinna’s poems reflects that of the third-century  60. see Gantz 1993, 245–47; Collins 2006, 29–30. 61. page (1963, 39) observes: “This is not our only warning that Corinna must be treated as a law unto  herself; we must never make inferences from the common tradition to Corinna, unless they can be verified by  reliable testimony.” 62. Collins refers to the enmity between Athens and Boeotia in the fifth century. 63. on the identity of the Asopides, see Bowra 1953, 54–65. 64. Berman 2010, 49. 65. The champion for the lower date is West 1970 and 1990. His linguistic arguments are answered by  davies (1988), who, significantly, does not side with the earlier date but emphasizes the inadequacy of the  current evidence. Metrical criteria were first put forth as an argument in support of a lower date by lobel  </page> <page sequence="13"> corinnA’s poetic MountAins 113 Boeotian inscriptions. of course, the argument from spelling is not conclu- sive, since reperformance of Corinna’s poetry could have led to the modern- ization of its spelling. 66 page considered the procedure of voting an indication of Corinna’s late  date. 67 in his view, the method of voting adopted by the divine jury in PMG  654 resembles that of the fifth-century Athenian courts, but a parochial poetess  such as Corinna could not have learned of this method from contacts with Ath- ens. page found the closest parallel in a locrian decree (IG iX, 12 3:718 = Tod  1932, no. 24; 460) where in line 44 we meet the phrase ἐν ὑδρίαν τὰν ψάφιξξιν  εἶμεν (“cast the ballots into an urn,” referring to voting in a trial). But ingomar  Weiler has called attention to the voting procedure in Aeschylus’ E umenides:  lines 874–75 (ἤδη κελεύω τούσδ ̓ ἀπὸ γνώμης φέρειν / ψῆφον δικαίαν, “i now  bid these ones here to cast a just vote with a good conscience”) are reminis- cent of PMG 654 col. i 19–21, while we meet the voting-urns mentioned in  Corinna at Eumenides 742 (ἐκβάλλεθ ̓ ὡς τάχιστα τευχέων πάλους, “remove  as quickly as possible the lots from the urns”). Corinna probably composed a  poem entitled Orestas and must thus have been familiar with the hero’s trial  in Athens. 68 one might also add that Corinna’s ψᾶφον . . . / κρουφίαν at lines  20–21 has a parallel in pindar Nemean 8.26 (κρυφίαισι . . . ἐν ψάφοις). 69 At  any rate, this method of voting need not be a late element and consequently  cannot be used as an argument for Corinna’s date. Corinna’s treatment of landscape does not allow a firm conclusion regarding  her date either. We may ask whether Helicon and Cithaeron are conceived of as  mountains or as humans who are transformed into the homonymous mountains  after the contest. The former view has parallels in folk poetry where mountains  are presented as arguing or competing against each other. 70 on the other hand,  the δ(έ) of line 32 indicates a change of subject, hence that the mountain and  Helicon are not one and the same entity at the narrated time. 71 For the original  audience, however, the names Helicon and Cithaeron would evoke both the  homonymous heroes and the stories related to them, as well as the mountains,  permanent and imposing features of the Boeotian landscape, which they as- sociated with certain types of poetry or stories. in the final analysis, the choice  between personified mountains or humans transformed into mountains does  not greatly affect the interpretation presented here. (1930), who thought that while the distribution of the “short” datives points to an earlier date, the treatment of  the combination of muta cum liquida suggests a lower date; his arguments were refuted by Bowra (1931, 4–5),  who showed that Corinna’s treatment of muta cum liquida is abundantly paralleled in other Archaic poets.  page (1963) did not choose either dating in the main body of his book, but settled for a lower date in the second  appendix (pp. 87–88). For a brief overview of the dating controversy, see Gerber 1997, 213–15. 66. The spelling and language of Corinna’s poetry suggest that it may have circulated in a local level;  cf. nagy 1990, 83 n. 3. 67. page 1963, 76–78; see also segal 1975, 6–8; Bolling 1956, 285–86. 68. page includes the Orestas fragment in the Fragmenta Boeotica incerti auctoris (= PMG 690); but West  (1970, 279) considers it together with other Boeotica incertis auctoris to be by Corinna. 69. see Weiler (1974, 85–87), who also points out that Tanagra was closer to Athens than to opuntian  locri; see also his n. 207 for parallels on the technical expression φερέμεν ψᾶφον of PMG 654.20. 70. see Kanavou (2010), who compares the Modern Greek folk song on the strife between Ὄλυμπος and  Κίσσαβος (= ancient Ὄσσα); for mountains conceived of in anthropomorphic terms in ancient Greek myth, see  also Clarke 1997, 67 and 72–73. of course, the anthropomorphic presentation of natural elements is already  found in Hesiod’s Theogony. 71. Cf. Berman 2010, 47–48. </page> <page sequence="14"> 114 AthAnAssios VergAdos For the purposes of dating, however, paolo Vivante, accepting that Corinna  conceives of Helicon and Cithaeron as mountains, found similarities with  pindar’s treatment of landscape, noting the two poets’ “conceiving places as  animated presences,” and their “see[ing] the legends as embodied in the place  itself and not forming a separate story running its own course.” 72 in this sense,  Corinna’s and pindar’s poetry does not imply the kind of metamorphoses we  find in Alexandrian and Roman poetry. on the other hand, Berman notes that  Helicon is some entity distinct from the mountain, which is yet unnamed but  will, as is common in etiological stories, acquire the singer’s name at the end  of the song. 73 even though this kind of etiologizing is more prominent in  Alexandrian poetry and certainly differs from the personifications of natural  entities that we meet in Homer (e.g., Xanthos/scamander) or Hesiod (e.g.,  Gaia, ouranos), there are a few examples of this type of etiological stories that  culminate in the transformation of humans into rocks or mountains in Archaic  and Classical poetry, which prevent us from advocating a very low date for  Corinna on such grounds. These are the story of niobe (Hom. Il. 24.602–17),  the metamorphosis of Battus (which may have been told in [Hes.] frag. 256),  and the transformation of the shepherd Atlas into the homonymous mountain,  said to have been narrated by polyidus (fifth or fourth century; PMG 837). 74 Albert schachter plausibly situates Corinna’s date somewhere in between: 75  following Andrew stewart, he accepts as genuine Tatian’s testimony (Ad Gr.  33) of a statue of Corinna by the fourth-century sculptor silanion (fl. 360–20);  this would yield a terminus ante quem. 76 The terminus post quem is provided  by the Curetes-motif in epimenides, which schachter, following West, dates  to 430. But if the Curetes-motif appears in Zeus’s birth story as early as  eumelus (see above, p. 109), then we are left without a certain terminus post  quem. What we can say with confidence, then, is that Corinna cannot be  later than the fourth century; but whether she was contemporary or slightly  younger than pindar remains an open question. 77 At any rate, it is certainly  possible that she was familiar with epimenides’ Theogony, which would also  be true even if one subscribed to the lower (Hellenistic) dating. 78 72. see Vivante 1979, esp. 85. 73. see Berman 2010, esp. 44–53. 74. see Forbes irving 1990, 289–90, 294–7; Buxton 2009, esp. 200–202. 75. see schachter 2005, 276–78, who follows stewart 1998, 278–81; see also palumbo stracca 1993,  411–12. 76. Tatian’s chap. 35 implies that he had seen some of these statues himself; cf. Bernard 1985, 46–47.  Bernard discusses a second-century parthian rhyton (found in nisa, in modern Turkmenistan) representing  an elderly bald and bearded male figure, who holds a shepherd’s staff and is surrounded by women of letters.  Bernard identifies the male figure with Hesiod, while the female character directly facing him is said to be  Corinna on account of her close resemblance with a statue of the poetess at the Vivenel Museum at Com- piègne, a  Roman copy of the statue of Corinna by silanion (see Bernard, p. 51, for a photograph of this statue).  if Bernard’s theory is correct, then we may obtain indirect evidence for a special relation between Corinna and  Hesiod: the poetess appears to be reading her work specifically to Hesiod, which would be extremely interest- ing in view of Corinna’s competitive engagement with Hesiod’s work posited here. if nothing else, this would  indicate that some members of Corinna’s ancient audience had perceived the existence of a special relation  between the two Boeotian poets. 77. Berman (2010, 59–61) also accepts a date in the middle or end of the fourth century. 78. epimenides’ poem was known to Callimachus, who cites from FGrH 457 F 2 in his Hymn to Zeus  (line 8). The possibility that Corinna may have adopted the Curetes-motif from epimenides is acknowledged  by Collins 2006, 28. </page> <page sequence="15"> corinnA’s poetic MountAins 115 5. Concluding Remarks in PMG 654, Cithaeron performs a song that alludes to Hesiod’s treatment of  Zeus’ birth story, but adds two important elements that diverge from the epic  version: the Curetes as nurturers of the infant Zeus and the Muses’ dissocia- tion from Hesiod’s Helicon, with whom they were linked in literature and  cult. it is plausible that Corinna’s Helicon performed a song that conformed  to Hesiod’s version, which was then followed by Cithaeron’s song that picked  up the theme from the previous contestant and varied it. 79 That Helicon’s  (now lost) song belonged to the same genre as Cithaeron’s is suggested by  the connection that existed between Helicon and Hesiod (see above, p. 106).  By presenting a narrative derived from Hesiod’s Theogony as the subject of  a poetic contest between two Boeotian characters/mountains in a poem com- posed in the local dialect, Corinna in effect claims this panhellenic story for  Boeotia and provides evidence for a local poetic rivalry in which panhellenic  stories are creatively used. 80 But unlike Corinna’s treatment of the story of the Teumesian fox, Cithae- ron’s song does not transfer the role or function of a non-Boeotian mytho- logical character to a Boeotian one. 81 nor is the mention of the Curetes “a  touch of panhellenism,” as Berman suggests. 82 For the Curetes are yet another  epichoric mythological element, a detail of Zeus’ birth story omitted from  what had become the panhellenic version (i.e., Hesiod’s Theogony). Corinna’s  choice to include the Curetes is therefore neither a sign of inter-polis antago- nism 83 nor a panhellenic element. Rather, it shows her subtle conversation  with the dominant tradition (i.e., the Hesiodic), which she modifies and adapts.  Her purpose is not simply to show Boeotian superiority at the expense of an- other polis’s traditions (by investing Boeotian characters with mythological  lore appropriated from a different city’s traditions), but to comment on her  poetic heritage and thereby establish her place within this tradition. in other  words, we need not always look for a political reason for Corinna’s innovative  traits. Corinna has an eclectic poetic voice of such standing that it allows her  79. For the practice of a contestant picking up the theme from the preceding song, we may compare the  Muses’ song, following that of the pierides and picking up the Typhoeus theme in ov. Met. 5.346–661. see  also Weiler (1974, 98–99), who refers to solon’s introduction of the rule on Homeric recitation ἐξ ὑπολήψεως  or ἐξ ὑποβολῆς at the panathenaic festival. We may further hypothesize that Helicon’s song focused on the  unpleasant theme of ouranos’ castration in Hesiod’s Theogony to which Cithaeron answered with a song on a  positive theme, Rhea’s mêtis that saved Zeus, who was one of the judges in this poetic contest. 80. see Berman 2010, 57–58 on the opposite phenomenon in the pseudo-Hesiodic Aspis in which Boeotian  material is presented in epic form. 81. But see Collins (2006, 29), who suggests that by attributing to Cithaeron a song that includes Zeus’  birth in Crete, i.e., a panhellenic narrative, “Corinna is once again thematically situating a story that involves  perhaps the most significant mountain in theogonic myth [sc. ida] . . . into a Boeotian context” and concludes  that “Cithaeron’s victory . . . means that Boeotia is nevertheless highlighted at the expense of Crete.” it would  be more apposite to speak of a mixture of Cretan and Boeotian lore in a panhellenic story, as opposed to  viewing this as a competition between Boeotia and Crete. The comparison with PMG 673 (the Teumesian fox)  shows that we are dealing here with two different ways of handling myth, i.e., modification (PMG 654) vs.  appropriation (PMG 672). i should also point out that i do not agree with Collins’ notion that Rhea stole Zeus  from Mount ida. Collins refers to sources in which the Curetes were depicted negatively; but what would be  the point of λαθράδαν ἀγκυλομείταο Κρόνω if the Curetes intended to harm Zeus, i.e., perform an action that  would benefit Cronus? 82. Berman 2010, 53. 83. Cf. Collins (2006, 31–32), who stresses the political aspect of Corinna’s innovations. </page> <page sequence="16"> 116 AthAnAssios VergAdos to enter into a dialogue with an authoritative figure such as Hesiod regardless  of her gender. By modifying Hesiod’s account (i.e., “adorning the oracles of  the forefathers,” as she puts it elsewhere), 84 she engages in a poetic practice  that we encounter both in and outside of Boeotia (pindar, epimenides), in  poets who certainly did not have a parochial outlook. in this respect, Collins’  conclusion that one ought “once and for all to overturn the stereotype of her  [Corinna’s] merely parochial concerns” is fully justified. 85 Various theogonic  narratives existed in antiquity, 86 and on the basis of what we have observed  in Corinna, epimenides, and pindar, we may posit the existence of a poetic  practice of “correcting” Hesiod by alluding to him and incorporating ele- ments of different provenance. 87 This, of course, should come as no surprise,  since Hesiod’s text had become an authority on matters pertaining to the  gods (Hdt. 2.53 is the locus classicus for this view), an authority which every  poet composing about the gods had to confront in one way or another. With  PMG 654 Corinna poetically rehabilitates Cithaeron, attests to the existence  of an ongoing commentary on Hesiod’s work, and evokes a poetic antagonism  within the Boeotian poetic community. Far from being a second-rate poetess  composing for the Greek backwaters, Corinna may actually offer us a precious  glimpse of Hesiod’s reception in antiquity. 88 Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg 84. Cf. PMG 655, 10–11 λόγια δ ̓ ἐπ πατέρω[ν | κοσμείσασα . . . ; see Burzacchini (1991, 60–61) for λόγια  = “oracles,” and Hesiod’s singing τά τ ̓ ἐσσόμενα πρό τ ̓ ἐόντα. For a similar adorning of older stories, see the  remarks in Collins (2006, 25–26) on Corinna’s treatment of orion. 85. Collins 2006, 32. Berman (2010, 59) concludes that Corinna’s “literary Boiotian is . . . simultaneously  parochial and cosmopolitan: parochial because it is Boiotian, and cosmopolitan because it couches itself in the  panhellenic literary koine of epic.” 86. An overview is provided by Gantz 1993, 739–43. 87. This process of “correcting” Hesiod does not preclude a political interpretation, but does not force us  to adopt one either. We can imagine, for example, that by privileging Cithaeron, Corinna might wish to support  plataea as Burzacchini (1990) has argued, instead of Thespiae; or that she might be promoting the cult of Mne- mosyne on that mountain instead of the cult of the Muses on Helicon, as West (1983, 50–51) has suggested. 88.
