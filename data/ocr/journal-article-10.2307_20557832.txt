<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michelle Sweeney and Jack Morgan Ancestral Voices: Padraic Colum and the Celtic Creature Poem By now there is an accomplished body of Irish poetry written after Yeats, but until recently, it was almost obligatory that contemporary Irish poets?and critics as well?cast a cold eye on the Revival in order to go forward creatively. As a result, if Padraic Colum (1881-1972) is mentioned at all these days, it is often as part of a collective list concluding with the deadly usage "et al." Anthony Bradley, for in stance, in his introduction to Contemporary Irish Poetry (1980), refers to the Re vival poets?"JE, Douglas Hyde, Katherine Tynan, ER.Higgins, Lady Gregory, James Stephens, Padraic Colum, et aV?and maintains that they have by now "as sumed, for the most part, a historical as opposed to a literary significance." Bradley goes on to note that the poetry in his anthology is "almost invariably more moving and intelligent in the way it deals with human experience, more complex and accomplished in its art... than that written by the Revival poets."1 We might grant that point without, however, going along with Colum's being so casually dismissed as a merely representative figure. This is a poet, after all, the "voltage" of whose early work Ezra Pound remarked in Pisan Canto LXXX.2 Most of the poems in Wild Earth (1916)?the likes of "The Beggar's Child," "Across the Door," and "A Poor Scholar of the Forties"?call for no apologies today, some ninety years after their publication. The dark enchant ment of "She Moved Through the Fair," another poem from that collection, has made it a standard lyric in the Irish musical canon, one still being recorded by such contemporary artists as Van Morrison and Mary Black. Sin?ad O'Connor's version recently served as the theme song for the film Michael Collins. It is true that most of Colum's work reflects an Ireland now largely passed, but surely there is another kind of significance, and even contemporary edge, to the often haunting, almost magic-realistic tenor of his best poetry. The pastoral erotics of "Branding the Foals," for example, remain fresh: Where do I look for fire to brand these foals? What do I need, when all is fire? i. Contemporary Irish Poetry, ed.

If he sang of the peasantry, it was not in tune with W. B. Yeats's genteel injunction to do so. As Sanford Sternlicht notes, Colum "never let the reading public forget that he was different from Yeats, JE, Lady Gregory, and the other writers who came out of the Protestant Ascendancy. He was the son of the Roman Catholic peasantry, and a descendant of the ancient Celtic people."4 Links with his Celtic past led Colum to take note of medieval Irish culture in a way not typical among the Revivalists generally. In his preface to his i960 retrospective collection The Poefs Circuits, for instance, Colum's identification with medieval Ireland, and his sense of his own work as an extension ofthat heritage, is made clear when he characterizes his career in terms of the poetic tradition of the Irish Middle-Ages: In medieval Ireland a poet from time to time crossed the boundary of the can ton he had residence in and went through other cantons, giving recitals, meet ing distinguished members of his guild, looking in on bardic schools, and clos ing with return to residence, bearing proper fees.... The tide of [this] collection, then, has to do with a poet who ... makes his [similar circuit].5 Even his inclination toward dramatic monologues?as in "A Poor Scholar," "An Old Woman on the Roads, " and many other poems?which might seem to de rive from his early work in the Irish Revival theater, Colum here ascribes to the Influence of medieval Irish traditions: "... I could claim that in [these dramatic monologues] I followed a traditional bent in Irish poetry: in the tenth century there are poems attributed to Columcille, to Grainne... that [likewise] project character and situation." In 1935, Colum wrote The Legend of St Columba and drew together the var ious legends pertaining to the sixth-century Irish saint?another indication of his interest in early medieval Ireland. In the "Author's Note" to his book on Columba, Colum points out that "like the other medieval saints... Columba has his animal associates?his cat, his crane, his wren "6 Many medieval Irish 3.

St. Ciaran of Saighir for example, tames a wild boar which then builds the saint a monastic cell. "Both it and other wild creatures?a fox, badger, wolf and stag?relate to Ciaran as disciples to their master or as monks to an abbot."7 In an introduction to a selection of early Irish literature titled "Creatures Great and Small," the Field Day Anthology (1991) remarks that a fre quent topic in the Lives of the Saints, "particularly those especially associated with the ascetic or anchoretic element in the Irish church, is the friendly famil iarity of the hermit saint with the creatures of the wild."8 Colum's own "So journing and Wandering," a translation of a medieval Irish poem, highlights the regular presence of animals in Irish poetry and in his own work. Animals here are defining elements in the turning of the seasons: A good stay-at-home season is Autumn: then there's work to be joined in by all: Though the faun, where the brakens make covert, may range away undeterred, The stags that were lone upon hillocks now give heed to the call, To the bellowing call of the hinds, and draw back to the herd. (CP106) The impressive set of specifically zoological poems Colum wrote over the years, twenty-four of which make up the "Creatures" section of his Collected Poems (1953), may also be regarded as suggesting his medieval interests and sensibilities. A largely overlooked aspect of Colum's achievement, his faunal poems maybe contextualized within the Irish tradition as well as in terms of the animal poem genre. However critically overlooked, creature poems form an important part of Colum's work during his most creative poetic period, 1900 or so, through to the early 1920s; Creatures first appeared as an independent collection, beautifully il lustrated, in 1927. The animal poem genre itself is a marginalized one, especially in academic circles, though such poems are part of an ubiquitous primitive tra dition. One of the earliest animal poems found in English is the arguably Irish sounding fourteenth-century anonymous verse: "I have a gentil cock / Crowyt me day; He doth me rysyn erly / My matins for to say."9 A companion rooster served the same purpose for the Irish hermit St. Mochua, according to Keating's seventeenth-century History of Ireland: "the office of the cock was to keep the hour of matins for him."10 7.

The corpus of American Indian poetry provides some mar velous examples. The human environment at large, from knick-knack shelves to the painted walls of the Lascaux cave, is decorated with artifacts reflecting totemic respect for, or fond tribute to, animals.11 They feature in our critical texts as well. The fourth tractate of Plotinus's Enneads, for example, considers the nature of human happiness, and commences with a consideration of ani mals and the creature-human continuum: "[T]ake for instance such [non human] living beings as have the gift of music; finding themselves well off... they sing, too, as their nature is, and so is their day pleasant to them."12 The as sumption here is that animals and humans represent versions of a single un derlying energy and that animals are thus relevant to our essential conceptual izations, even self-conceptualizations. Birds are part of the idiom of poetic mythology, and they are primary palyers in Irish lore and literature?from the crows in the T?in B? C?ailgne to the swans in the Lir story and, later, in Yeats. Wild geese serve as figures of exRe and expatriation. The mariners in The Voy age ofMaeldun encounter the Isle of the Talking Birds. Regarding birds, Levi Straus points out that they ... form a community which is independent of our own but, precisely because of this independence, appears to us like another society, homologous to that in which we live_Everything objective conspires to make us think of the bird world as a metaphorical human society.13 In the poem "In St. Stephen's Green," Colum returns to the forsaken streets of Dublin, radically changed from those he had known in his youth, to find only the familiar magpies still around.14 The magpies serve as apt figures to convey the returning emigre's sense of bereftness, for they seem, "Like nuns of an order so severe / None have remained but they.,.." (SP 87-88). Colum had always written affectionately of birds, as is in these lines from "Before the Fair": And climbing, turning, and climbing His little stair of sound, h. Not all literatures and literary periods afford the same attention to animals. Fauna! fascina tion is not a characteristic of Wordsworth's poetry, despite its pastoralism, nor of British Roman tic poetry as a rule. Victorian poetry, however, offers a broad range of animal interests and concerns. See Harriet Ritvo, The Animal Estate: The English and Other Creatures in the Victorian Age (Cam bridge: Harvard University Press, 1987). 12. Plotinus, The Enneads, tr.

This view of St. Stephen's Green probably dates from Colum's return to Dublin in the 1960s, after Mary Column death in 1957. 123</page><page sequence="5">Ancestral Voices: Padraic Colum and the Celtic Creature Poem "Content," "content" from the low hedge The redbreas t sings in a round. ( CP 272) Birds likewise serve him as objective correlatives. It was said of Colum that there was about him "always the boy who stood in the workhouse window and watched the wandering, rootless Ireland... of the great hunger."15 His memory of that harsh, wasted Ireland is reflected in these lines from "An Old Woman Selling Ducks": From each end of the basket, too frightened to quack, A duck sticks a beak, And frightened is she, the old body who'd sell them, And hardly will speak: As she trudges along with her ducks, each as thin As the water hen. ( SP 74) In "Bards, Beasts and Men," a sociolinguistic study of animals in seventeenth and eighteenth century Irish culture, Terence McCaughy quotes the following observation by Roy Willis: The distinctive peculiarity of animals is that, being at once close to Man and strange to him, akin to him and unalterably not-man, they are able to alternate, as objects of human thought, between the contiguity of the m?tonymie code and the distanced, analogical mode of the metaphor. This means that, as symbols, animals have the convenient faculty of representing both the existential and the [social] normative aspects of human experience, as well as their interrelation.16 This human intimacy with other creatures has a long history but is often ne glected as a field of symbolic and philosophical interest. Christ, the lamb of God, was born among animals in their dwelling, and it is notable that we do not find this Agnus Dei characterization profane or inappropriate, but rather feel it to be positively loving and honorific. Animals have thus become an inextrica ble part of the mythic gestalt of Christmas; it is the rare representation of Christ's nativity in which oxen and sheep are not as prominently present as his mother and father and the Magi. Before returning to Colum's work, it would be useful to explore further the rich concourse of creature poetry and turn briefly to the American poet Eliza beth Bishop and one of her preeminent creature poems "Roosters." This poem affords a paradigmatic animal poetics model by tracing the whole profile of cockerels in the human imagination and the morphology of that creature's image in the human mind. We previously mentioned St. Mochua's rooster com 15- Padraic Fiacc, quoted by Sandford Sternlicht in his entry on Colum in Modem Irish Writers, ed. Alexander G.

Bishop's poem follows in this tradition by presenting aspects of this spirited bird from its presence as a figure found, until recently, even in urban backyards, to its role as heralder of daybreak and as the age-old defining image of virility, grit, and belligerence?"cockiness." Bishop treats the rooster's implication in the story of Peter's denial of Jesus represented, for example, in medieval iconography portraying that terrible moment: Christ stands amazed, Peter, two fingers raised to surprised lips, both as if dazed. But in between a little cock is seen carved on a dim column in the travertine, explained by gallus canit Flet Petrus underneath it... yes, and there Peter's tears run down our chanticleer's sides and gem his spurs. Nor does this exhaust the material that Bishop's mythic imagination discovers in the biblical tableau, defining further the creature's role in St. Peter's crisis and drawing out the story's spiritual implications. Myth is protean. As well as fig uring the apostle's moral lapse, the rooster also comes to suggest the fact that Peter is not finally lost, that there is Godly clemency: ... Poor Peter, heart-sick still cannot guess those cock-a-doodles yet might bless, his dreadful rooster come to mean forgiveness There would always be a bronze cock on a porphyry pillar so the people and the Pope might see that even the Prince of the Aposties long since had been forgiven, and to convince all the assembly that "Deny deny deny" is not all the roosters cry.17 17.

They do not suggest to us that our species is not one set off by itself and privileged with a separate peace, but rather that Man looks on, as William Blake wrote, "in tree and herb and fish and bird and beast, collecting up the scattered portions of his immortal body.,. "18 Thomas Hardy, D. H. Lawrence, Robinson leffers, T. S. Eliot, Ted Hughes, in ad dition to Bishop, are some of the many major poets besides Colum who have written extensively of creatures in their poetry. An admirer of the genre, Ezra Pound included in his Guide to Culture (1938) two examples from Eckart von Sydow's anthology Dichtungen der Naturv?lker. "The Lioness Warns Her Cubs" instances human venturing into the sensibility of animals?the adoption of a voice that assumes a shared nature-consciousness. The lioness cautions her cub: Ware of one with sharp weapons... Thou my child with short ears Thou with blood-red nostrils, Son of the lioness who drinketh swamp water, water-lapper my son.19 In the same genre is Colum's "River Mates," whose subject is otters, another popular animal in Irish folk material.20 In the Sweeney narrative Buile Shuibne, for example, composed around the twelfth century, there occurs an episode in which the angry Sweeney throws the monk Ronan's psalter into the lough and an otter miraculously saves the illuminated volume, surfacing with it in good shape despite a day and a night underwater. The same event figures in section X of Seamus Heaney's "Station Island."21 The first of Colum's creature poems to appear, "River Mates" revealed early on his engagement with the Irish faunal tradition: 1*11 be an otter, and I'll let you swim A mate beside me;.. my teeth are on edge For the King-Fish of the River!

(SP 46 ) As in "The Lioness Warms Her Cubs," a middle voice is achieved here that de fies ascription to the "human" or "animal" worlds. We seem rather to enter as humans, through the poem, into the dreaming of creatures. Arguably driving the otter poem is an assumption of an animal world homologous to our own and bound up in nature with our own, not merely analogically similar. Colum returned to the creature poem often during the 1920s. The genre al lowed him to carry forward the inherited Irish affinity for animals, which, while rooted in pagan antiquity, was not disavowed in later Christian Ireland.22 The legendary Irish concern with horses, for instance, endures in Celtic art from rep resentations of the horse goddess Epona to the abundance of Irish horses in the work of Jack B. Yeats. As T. G. Rosenthal observes, Jack Yeats loved horses, "knew them deeply, and always found the challenge of representing them in motion irresistible and rewarding "23 The atmosphere of horse fairs in early twentieth century Irish market towns, so well captured in Yeats's art, is likewise tangible in Colurhs poems. In these lines from "Asses," the donkey sales, among the shab bier aspects of the fair, are contrasted to the refinement of the horse sales, and they read like a poetic analog to some of Yeats's illustrations. O the black and roan horses the street would fill, Their mains and tails streaming, and they standing still, And their owners, the men of estate, would be there, Refusing gold guineas for a colt or a mare. With men slouching beside them and buyers not near It's no wonder the asses held down head and ear. They had been sold or in by-ways bought For a few half-crowns tied up in a knot ....(SP 62-63} Animals, including horses, are deeply involved in Irish magical and fairy narratives, in shape-shifting lore, and in folk legends, The Brigit Cleary affair, subject of considerable recent interest, reveals the survival of belief in fairy changelings in rural Tipperary through the nineteenth century. A white horse was a significant figure in the dark-magical superstition involved in this witch 22. In medieval Irish writing, such events as the otter's rescue of Ronan s psalter in Buik Suihfme come to be read in a Christian context as "miraculous" rather than "magicaL* 23, T. G.

For discussion of Epona, see Green, p. 27. 127</page><page sequence="9">Ancestral Voices: Padraic Colum and the Celtic Creature Poem burning; the horse fulfilled a folkloric animal role in providing passage into fairy reality.24 In Celtic art and lore, animals often afford a connection to the preter natura that enables magical journeying between natural and enchanted terrains. Miranda Green notes that early Celtic documents "open a door on a world of shifting realities and ambiguities, where animals interact closely with both hu mankind and the gods..." It is a world "where animals can speak to people and where divine beings can change at will between human and animal forms Animals were special and central to all aspects of [the Celtic] world."25 Both fabulous and actual creatures are prominent in the the T?in B? C?ail gne and in The Book of the Dun Cow generally, as well as in the art of The Book ofKells. McCaughy notes the closeness of the relationship of man and dog evi dent in accounts of the fall of the Fianna in Bruidhean Cheise Corainn, and re marks therein "the loving recital of the names of [the Fianna's] hounds-"26 Thomas D'Arcy McGee's poem "The Celts" refers to the era of the Fianna when "youths alone / With giant dogs, explored the elk resorts / and brought them down."27 Besides instancing the importance of dogs in Irish culture, these lines exemplify another symbolic function common for animals in Irish poetry? their service in tropes of nostalgia for an untamed Ireland, a time of austere dig nity in the land, in presumed contrast to a later cultural tameness. The theme is a frequent one in Colum's work, as in "Reminiscence": An old man said, "I saw The chief of the things that are gone; A stag with head held high, A doe, and a fawn; "And they were the deer of Ireland That scorned to breed within bound; The last; they left no race Tame on a pleasure ground." (CP10-11) Swans, too, occur commonly as familiar tropes in Irish story tradition, from "The Dream of Aengus" and "The Children of Lir" to Yeats's "The Wilds Swans at Coole " Likewise important are bulls, as demonstrated in the Tarn's ninth century tale, "The Quarrel of the Two Pig-Keepers" where, in the begetting-of the-bulls section, the Brown Bull of Cuailnge is vividly sketched: 24. See Angela Bourke, The Burning of Bridget Chary: A True Story (New York: Viking, 1999). The Gabriel Byrne film Into the West (1993) provides another example of the Irish tradition in which horse play a role in magical journeying. 25. Green, p, 4. 26. McCaughey, p. 115. 27.

Indeed, the first manuscript example of personal po etry in Irish is the animal verse "Pangur Ban." Of this poem Robin Flower in The Irish Tradition writes that: "it is very characteristic that the verses should be con cerned with the scholar's cat. One is reminded of the quaint cat that twists its elongated form round the litany of the ... Irish Stowe Missal" In the poem's eight stanzas, the medieval author fondly views his own quotidian textual pur suits as analogous to his cat's mousing ones: So in peace our tasks we ply, Pangur Ban, my cat, and I; In our arts we find our bliss, I have mine and he has his.29 In the same period, Sedulius Scottus penned a charming elegy in Latin to a ram. Translated by Thomas Kinsella for The New Oxford Book of Irish Verse, the con cluding stanza reads: Great king of the snow-white herd, all hail, farewell! You might have used my garden, alas, and lived. I might have prepared a heated bath, my friend, in accord with the laws of hospitality, and scrubbed the water with a diligent breast, onto your hoofs and onto the horns of your head. Say only I loved you, your widow and mother also. And your brothers too, I shall ever love. Farewell.50 Given such examples, Sean O'Faolain argues that the most attractive images of the early Irish world reside "not in the greater sagas but in,.. pre-tenth-cen tury lyrics and the Middle-Irish Ossianic tales and poemsT When Oisin returns to earth after centuries, O'Faolain notes, and is listening to St. Patrick speak, a blackbird's whistle ignites in his mind memories of the surviving primitive 28.

In his song it is the animals and their cries that Oisin celebrates: The call of the blackbird of Derrycairn, The belling of the stag from Caill na gCaor, That is the music by which Finn met early sleep; And the wild duck of Loch na dTri Caol? 31 Likewise, "Migrant Poet," written by John Montague "after the Early Irish," re veals the traveling bard's dependence upon the cycles and seasons of the animal world for his own sense of orientation in time and space: Now I head north to stay from Samhain Until the cuckoo calls from the royal dun. Listen, the brent goose wings across the sea, Salmon sleep in the clear, cold stream. Every bird seeks its winter quarters. I'll not stir, till summer comes again.32 Nor is contemporary Irish poetry lacking other examples of such creature material. As the Puck Fair in Kerry still annually evokes a pre-Christian fertil ity celebration of a wild goat, so even the most recent Irish verse, for all its com paratively urban focus, still evidences the traditional Celtic interrogation of the human-animal kinship. Moya Cannon's recent poem "Script" captures the deep human intriguement with creatures, one which it would not be hyperbolic to call spiritual. A lone seal pup has come up on a beach, after a storm, to just above the wrack: "It panted, blinking away the driven sand, / while a wind-ripped tide ebbed fast." Then a few other pups appear. When these mammals return to the sea some people, "a couple of bright raincoats, down for the weekend / and two boys on bikes who'd heard the news," go down to the shore and look at the marks inscribed where the creature hauled itself up the strand?marks that trace in the sand "a breast stroke, a perfect cursive script."33 That is all?these animals up from the sea, and now gone?but there is an underlying sense here of awe, mystery, meaningful visitation. The seal pup manifests for us, objecti fies for our contemplation, the spirit that animates us and our own inquisitive, tumbling children. This spirit transcends the private self and private human species and speaks of a deeper, more complex reality than we ordinarily per ceive. The seal pup is a joy and revelation; its traces are a significant sign. John Montague's "Mount Eagle " the title poem of the 1989 collection in which "Migrant Poet" appears, is a piece in four sections written from the per 31.

The poem assumes the kind of com mon human-creature perspective typical in animal poems: How he liked the slight, drunk lurch of the fishing fleet, the tide hoist ing them a little, at their ropes end. Beyond, wrack, and the jutting rocks emerging, slowly, monsters stained And slimed with strands of seaweed. Ashore, beached boats and lobster pots, settled as hens in the sand.34 Columns poem "Vultures" might be set against Montague's, its irony being that even the awesomeness of flight cannot purge the buzzard of its gross squalid ness. The poem employs a motif common in ancient Irish poetry?the sinister ugliness of such carrion birds as ravens and vultures. Foul-feathered and scald-necked, They sit in evil state; Raw marks upon their breasts As on men's wearing chains. Impure, though they may plunge Into the morning's springs, And spirit-dulled, though they Command the heaven's heights. Angels of foulness, ye, Sloth on your muffled wings, And speed within your eyes! ( CP 179 ) Gorse Fires (1993) by Michael Longley includes a noteworthy otter poem and another on ponies. For instance, Ciaran Carson s powerful poem "Second Na ture" in First Language (1994) also involves the characteristic assumption of zo ological poetry that the human mind can enter a kind of one-mind with other living things. A man of horse insight addresses the "I" of the poem: 'Come over here' says Turnbull, 'till you see the sorrow in the horses eyes; If you had hooves as cumbersome, there would be gloom in your eyes too.' And it was clear to me, that he had understood the sorrow in the horse's eyes 34- Montague, p. 68. 131</page><page sequence="13">Ancestral Voices: Padraic Colum and the Celtic Creature Poem So well, had dwelt so long on it, that he was plunged in the horse's mind.35 Elsewhere in Carson's collection are other poems of close animal observation including such haiku-like translations from the Welsh as: "Mountain snow, the moorcock crows; his loneliness betrays him to the hunter," or: "Mountain snow, the ducks are out of water; they slither out of kilter on the ice."36 Many anony mous Irish monastic poems are possessed of a similar haiku-like transparency: "A bird is calling from the willow / with lovely beak, a clean call."37 Or: Beetles, bees, With their tiny buzzing And delicate hum; Wild barnacle geese (It will soon be Samain!) With their wild, dark music?38 Animals are critical presences in Colum's work even outside his "Creatures" series. What is probably his most familiar poem, the much-anthologized "A Drover," is the monologue of a lone man driving his cattle at night, and ren ders a sense of their primacy in his thoughts, his pondering of their presence: "I hear in the darkness / Their slipping and breathing. ..." It concludes with his mentally addressing them: "I will bring you, my kine, / where there's grass to the knee / But you will think of scant croppings/ Harsh with salt of the sea." (CP 84-85). And the very first note in the autobiographical start to The Poefs Circuits shows the deep implication of animals in Colum's own sense of mem ory and thus of self: From where the solitary crow, the grey, Infamous in our sagas, fluttered over The flatness of the bog, to where familiar Crows gathered in the trees beside a house, He drove me: there were miles of rutted road. It was Easter of my twentieth year, And Easter was betokened: half-grown lambs Beside their mothers in a rocky field; Black cattle making tracks Between the golden bushes of the whins_(PC 1) This sort of involvement with the communion of animal and human commu nities is evident as well in such medieval, Celtic "historical" texts as Gerald of 35.

The fourteenth-century Welsh poet Dafydd ap Gwilym is renowned for his animal poems. Indeed, Colum begins Creatures with a tribute to Dafydd? "David ap Gwillam at the Mass of the Birds" another indication of Colum's identification with the Celtic faunal legacy. The reference is to Dafydd s poem "The Woodland Mass " one of his many animal poems. There are nine in the Penguin Selected Poems of Dafydd ap Gwilym (1985)?on thrushes, magpies, foxes, owls, and so on. Colum's interest in Dafydd s work is elsewhere evident in his "Imitation of a Welch Poem" wherein Dafydd and his lover Morfydd have an uncanny encounter with Dafydd's Irish hound (CP 139). Colum's aMass of the Birds" employs the Welsh poet's central conceit, the avian clergy and demonstrates Colum's considerable skills in refurbishing traditional materials.39 In the poem birds celebrate the Mass; the lark sings the Kyrie, and the thrash the Orate Fratres. The thrush also elevates the sacrament at the consecration: "The thrush it was who, as the sun appeared, / Held up the Monstrance, a dew circled leaf!" (CP 152).40 Colum is perforce writing here within a familiar medieval tradition in which animals are worked into a distinctly human framework and employed "unreal isticaUy"?allegorically, or symbolically?as in such popular genres as fable and exempla. Unlike his "River Mates," Colum's otter poem quoted earlier, Dafydd's original "Mass" and Colum's translation make a point of imaginative ingenu ity. The poetic conceit takes precedence over animal particularity, and the ac tual bird species involved is of much lesser importance. As Joyce Salisbury notes in her The Beast Within: Animals in the Middle Ages, the literary animals of the later middle ages tend to be metaphoric ones, constituting a tropic zoology liv ing "in the borders of human imagination, where any particular animal is al most irrelevant compared to its symbolic meaning."41 Remarking again how comfortable our imaginations are with, for example, the image of Christ as lamb, it is significant that Dafydd, even in an arguably symbolic context, did not find the image of birds consecrating the host profane or sacrilegious. This bent may have been reinforced, in fact, by the spread of a 39- The particular object of Pound's "voltage" compliment in The Cantos is Colum's version of, by way of Douglas Hyde, the anonymous, sixteenth-century Gaelic poem "I Shall Not Die for Thee" 40. Based on Sir Thomas Parry's critical edition in Welsh of Dafydd ap Dwilym (1952), English translations from Dafydd of the quality of Rachael Bromwich's and Richard Morgan Loomis s were not available to Colum in the 1910s and 1920s. Colum had access only to less-than-inspired trans lations, such as those in the 1834 London edition of Dafydd ap Gwilym. 41.

Francis created an ethos in which an imals were revered within the religious context as themselves, not just in the ser vice of symbolic, figurative expression. The attitude evident in the Welsh poem may owe more to, however, an Irish tradition already in place. The Franciscan sensibility was anticipated in Ireland by, for example, the saint-lore mentioned earlier, in which animal companions figure. Identifying the fourteenth through the seventeenth centuries in Ireland as the "Franciscan centuries," Robin Flower notes that the Irish were "naturally Franciscan": For, when we read the records of the early Church, the legends, the poems, the rules, we cannot escape the feeling that we are here in presence of a rehearsal of the Franciscan drama, centuries before it was staged at Assisi-[In the work of these early Irish writers] all natural things and creatures are seen as with an eye made magically clear and simple by some strange chastity of vision.42 Such a viewpoint characterizes the work of both Colum and ap Gwilym. The fanciful, unrealistic employment of creatures in "Mass of the Birds," is un characteristic of both poets. In Colum's typical poems, animals are represented authentically and retain their precise natural identities, despite inevitable ele ments of personification. That realism, as we have seen, was part of a long standing Celtic praxis. Similarly, Dafydd was as a rule an exception to the late medieval symbolic tendency that Salisbury describes. In her Tradition and In novation in the Poetry of Dafydd ap Gwilym, as well as in her introduction to Dafydd's Selected Poems, Rachael Bromwich points out that, despite all the flights of fancy in his verse and his employment of such conventions as birds as love-messengers, for Dafydd "as often as not it is the forest setting itself which is the poet's real subject, together with its natural inhabitants, the animals and the birds."43 This observation defines a distinction in faunal poetry between the creatures being employed purely as vehicles for a more abstract meaning and their being valued for a specific character essential to what is being envisioned. Referring to birds in particular, Bromwich notes their frequency in various lit eratures as mere exempla, and asserts that the distinctive feature of Dafydd's bird poetry is that personification is always balanced by "close observation of each bird's true ... characteristics," This poetic virtue accounts for Colum's ad miration of Dafydd's work. The strength of Colum's own poems in the genre is the strength that Bromwich identifies in Dafydd's?"exact and accurate obser vation" of animals, "an almost mystical reverence,.. ,"44 42.

Rather, we find something akin to the medieval Irish "chastity of vision* noted by Flower. What emerges is not glib anthropomorphism but, rather, in sight into that commonality of living things that is paradoxically bound up with their individuality. In Dafydd's "Seagull," for instance, for all the poem's imag inative richness, the mystery of a specific living creature is honored and adroitly captured: ... a fragment of the sun, gauntlet of the sal? sea. You are light upon the ocean wave, swift, proud, fish-eating bird. Yonder you would ride at anchor holding hands with me, sea lily. Like a white page of brilliant texture A nun on the wave's crest you are.45 Likewise, the essential particularity of his subject is retained by Colum even in lines as tropological and human-involved as these from "Crane": I know you, Crane: I, too, have waited, Waited until my heart Melted to little pools around my feet! Comer in the morning ere the Crows, Shunner, Searcher? Something find for me! ? (CP 166} Colum's faunal poems often evidence this primitive, virtually symbiotic sense of relationship with the animals involved, recalling the rapport L?vy Bruhl argues prevailed before our modern "dissociation" from the natural world.46 The best of Colum's creature poems are marked by his capacity to achieve an imaginative congruity with monkeys, pigeons, foxes, bats, and even aquarium fish, or to express the awkward pathos of exiled macaws in an urban pet shop: "Macaws that stare, / And blow into the conches of their beaks, / And climb with their club feet* (CP 153). Such faunal poems suggest that critical eval uations of his poetry should venture beyond the revivalist stereotyping that has obscured the range and accomplishment of Column art.
