<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FALL OFTYDEUS AND THE FAILURE OF SATAN: STATIUS' THEBAID, DANTE'S COMMEDIA, AND MILTON'S PARADISE LOST GEORGE F. BUTLER Throughout Paradise Lost (1667 and 1674), Milton contrasts the classical heroism of Satan with the Christian heroism of the Son. The most important classical model for Milton's epic was Virgil's Aeneid(ca. 19 B.C.), in which the hero Aeneas dutifully obeys his father and the gods, valiantly fights his enemies, and triumphantly gives birth to the Roman world. As Mario A. Di Cesare has summarized, "Nobody would quarrel with the view that Vergil's Aeneid is the major 'literary model' for Paradise Lost!'1 Central to the Aeneid is the conflict between Aeneas and Turnus, through which Virgil contrasts pietas and impietas. In Milton's reworking of the Aeneid, the Son becomes an imitation of pius Aeneas, while Satan becomes an adaptation of impius Turnus. While such an interpretation of Paradise Lost is generally valid, it is also simplistic. Milton did not slav ishly imitate Virgil, and he had many other epics from which to borrow. One such epic is Statius' Thebaid (ca. A.D. 90), a poem heavily indebted to the Aeneid. But while the Aeneid is the story of the triumph of Aeneas and the founding of Rome, the Thebaid is about the destruction of Thebes. In its story of fratricidal strife, the Thebaid reflects a much more troubled and chaotic world than that of the Aeneid, and it is far more pessimistic in tone and outlook. James D. Garrison has remarked that "the fundamental conflict in Roman history between pietas and impietas receives epic treat ment in this version of the seven against Thebes," and that "the triumph of furor over pietas evident in the broad design of the poem is also apparent in particular episodes."2 If the Aeneid is a celebration of pietas, the Thebaid might be considered an examination of impietas. Milton could thus turn to COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES, Vol. 43, No. 1-2,2006.

In the Thebaid, Tydeus, the king of Calydon, exhibits the same classical heroism as Satan and Aeneas do. But unlike Aeneas, Tydeus transgresses the conventions of pietas at the time of his death, and his heroism is ultimately a failure. The fall of Tydeus was later utilized by Dante in the Commedia (ca. 1314-1321), and thus it was further popularized throughout the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. In Paradise Lost, Milton equates Satan with Tydeus to emphasize the devils faulty heroism and punishment. In doing so, Milton makes use of both the Thebaid and the Commedia. One of the earliest accounts of Satan's rebellion and impietas in Paradise Lost is the Leviathan simile, in which Milton compares the fallen angel to several figures from classical and biblical mythology. The vanquished devil Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge As whom the Fables name of monstrous size, Titanian, or Earth-born, that warr'd on Jove, Briareos or Typhon, whom the Den By ancient Tarsus held, or that Sea-beast Leviathan, which God of all his works Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream: Him haply slumb'ring on the Norway foam The Pilot of some small night-founder cl Skiff, Deeming some Island, oft, as Seamen tell, With fixed Anchor in his scaly rind Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delays: So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay. (PL 1.196-209)3 Erasmo di Valvasone had previously described Satan in terms of Briareos in his LAngeleida (1590), a poem about the war in heaven, and Milton may have known Valvasone's work.4 Milton's commentators have generally pointed to Hesiod's Theogony (ca. 750 B.C.E.) as the principal source for Miltons allusion to Briareos. In a gloss on the passage in his edition of Miltons po etry, Merritt Y. Hughes says, "In the war of the Titans with the Olympian gods the hundred-armed Briareos is described by Hesiod (Theog, 713-16) as helping to defeat his brother Titans."5 Among Milton's editors, Harris Francis Fletcher, Douglas Bush, Christopher Ricks, Burton Raffel, and John T. Shawcross do not cite any particular source for the allusion; Scott Elledge and Alastair Fowler point to the Theogony as part of the general background</page><page sequence="3">136 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES of Milton's series of mythological references in the simile; while Stephen Orgel and Jonathan Goldberg, Roy Flannagan, and John Leonard cite the Theogony as a source for the allusion to Briareos, with Leonard additionally mentioning Virgil's Aeneid!3 While Briareos is mentioned in the Theogony, a close look at Hesiod's poem shows that it is an unlikely source for Milton's allusion. A more plausible source for Milton's Briareos is the Thebaid, which Milton's editors have disregarded in their notes on the passage. Certainly the Theogony is part of the general background of Milton's simile. The simile shows the aftermath of the War in Heaven, which Raphael describes in Book 6, and William M. Porter has argued that "no other single work is alluded to in Paradise Lost 6 so extensively or to such purpose as the Theogony!"1 In that poem, Hesiod tells how the Titans battled the Olympian gods, and their struggle is a classical counterpart of the Christian War in Heaven. But in Hesiod's account, Briareos fights against the Titans and helps Zeus defeat his adversaries. In fact, Briareos and his brothers, Cottus and Gyes, throw the Titans down to Tartarus and bind them in chains: 01 h ap eul irpo)TOLOi notxyv bpLp.eiap eyeipap Kottoc; 7 Bptapeuc; re Vvrjc; r' ololtoq icokefiOLo, oi pa.

Achilles reminds Thetis, his mother, that she once summoned Aegaeon, whom the gods called Briareos, to thwart the attempt of Athena, Hera, and Poseidon to enchain Zeus: a\\a av top y e\Bovaa, Sect, vpeXvaao beoyLUv, o) enotToy eipov Kotkeooto ec; fxaKpbv OXvfnrov, op Bpiapeup ncikeovoi Beoi, oipopec; be re iraprec; Aiyatcop - o yap ctvre ftir) ov iraTpbq a^e[pa)p.

A more likely source for Milton's allusion to Briareos is the Thebaid of Statius. Milton had studied the Thebaid during his years at Cambridge. According to Harris Francis Fletcher, Richard Holdsworth had advocated that during the last quarter of the senior year at Cambridge, students should read Statius, in addition to Seneca, Lucan, and Homer. These readings were</page><page sequence="5">138 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES intended to be a review of previously studied material, and so Milton would have read the Latin poet before the close of his senior year. Statius was a popular classical author among Miltons contemporaries. Michael Drayton had mentioned Statius in The Barons' Wars (1603), and Sir William Davenant had listed Statius and several other epic poets in Gondibert (1651). Ben Jonson had praised Statius in his commonplace book, Timber: Or Discoveries (1640), in a discussion of literary imitation. Earlier authors had borrowed from Statius, and Milton was familiar with their works. Chaucer had ex tensive knowledge of Statius and made use of the Thebaid in his Troilus and Criseyde (ca. 1385). Milton knew Chaucer through Thomas Speght's 1602 second edition, and echoes of Chaucer abound in Miltons earlier writings. Spenser had likewise been influenced by Statius, and mAreopagitica (1644), Milton refers to "our sage and serious Poet Spencer, whom I dare be known to think a better teacher then Scotus ox Aquinas" (CPW2: 516).10 Miltons editors have noted echoes of Statius throughout his works, and both Charles Grosvenor Osgood and Douglas Bush count Statius among Miltons clas sical authorities.11 The Thebaid had been widely read and commented on from antiquity through the seventeenth century. It was preserved in more than 112 manu scripts, most of which included marginal glosses, notes, or lengthy commen taries. Three full-length commentaries were written during the Middle Ages, including a particularly influential one attributed to Lactantius Placidus (fl. ca. 550 A.D.), which chiefly provides literal explanatory glosses for names, places, rhetorical figures, and the like; six other commentaries were written during the Renaissance.12 The commentary traditionally ascribed to Fabius Planciades Fulgentius (fl. ca. 500 A.D.) reads the poem as an allegory for the attack on the Soul (Thebes), which is ruled by Sacred Light (Laius), who is married to Joy (Jocasta). Laius and Jocasta give birth to Oedipus, who in killing his father is like the Soul of humanity putting out the Sacred Light. Oedipus marries Jocasta and their children include Eteocles (Greed, which causes the destruction of morals) and Polynices (Lust, which conquers many). The two are to take turns ruling Thebes. Eteocles rules first, and Polynices goes into exile in Greece. Polynices marries Agria (Foreknowledge), the daughter of King Adrastus of Greece (Philosophy). When Eteocles refuses to give up his rule, seven kings of Greece set out for Thebes to seek ven geance. These kings are the Seven Liberal Arts, all subject to Philosophy. The seven kings are killed, which shows the weakness of the Arts against Greed. When Eteolces and Polynices fight and kill each other, Creon (Pride) arises. He refuses to allow their burial, and their wives appeal to Theseus (God),</page><page sequence="6">THE FALL OF TYDEUS AND THE FAILURE OF SATAN 139 who conquers Creon as Humility destroys Pride.13 The Thebaid appeared in several Renaissance editions. Probably the most important was that of Joannes Bernartius, the last of the Neo-Latin commentators on Statius, whose commentary was first printed at Antwerp in 1595 and reprinted at least five times between 1595 and 1618.14 His P. Statii Papinii opera quae extanty Io. Bernartius adlibros veteres recensuit &amp;scoliis illustrauit (Lyon, 1608) includes some marginal glosses and sometimes appears in a volume with Ioh. Bernarti ad P. Stati Papini Thebaidos et Achilleidos Scholia ad Sylvarvm Libros Notae (Lyon, 1608), which provides roughly 200 pages of notes. In Book 2 of the Thebaid, Tydeus is ambushed on his way to Thebes. Though fifty Thebans have been sent to fight him (Theb. 2.493-94), he valiantly defeats them. As he slays his foes, Statius compares him to Bri areos: non aliter?Geticae si fas est credere Phlegrae? armatum immensus Briareus stetit aethera contra, hinc Phoebi pharetras, hinc torvae Pallados anguis, inde Pelethroniam praefixa cuspide pinum Martis, at hinc lasso mutata Pyracmone temnens fulmina, cum toto nequiquam obsessus Olympo tot queritur cessare manus. (Theb. 2.595-601)15 [Not otherwise?if Getic Phlegra be worthy credence?stood Briareus vast in bulk against embattled heaven, contemning on this hand Phoebus' quiver, on that the serpents of stern Pallas, here Mars' Pelethronian pinewood shaft, with point of iron, and yonder the thunderbolts oft changed for new by weary Pyracmon, and yet complaining, though combatted in vain by all Olympus, that so many hands were idle.] Statius, unlike Homer or Hesiod, describes Briareos battling the Olympian deities. Because Statius tells of the rebellion of Briareos, his account more closely matches Milton's comparison of Briareos and the vanquished Satan. Moreover, both Milton and Statius emphasize Briareos' enormity. For Statius, the monster is "immensus" ["huge"] (Theb. 2.596); for Milton, Satan is "in bulk as huge" as Briareos (PL 1.196) and "of monstrous size" (PL 1.197). For Milton, the combat between Briareos and the Olympians becomes a classical analogue of the War in Heaven.</page><page sequence="7">140 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Statius' source for the comparison of Tydeus to Briareos is a passage in the Aeneid, in which Virgil compares Aeneas to Aegaeon. As Aeneas savagely defeats his foes on the battlefield, he fights like the classical monster: Aegaeon qualis, centum cui bracchia dicunt centenasque manus, quinquaginta oribus ignem pectoribusque arsisse, Iovis cum fulmina contra tot paribus streperet clipeis, tot stringeret ensis: sic toto Aeneas desaevit in aequore victor, ut semel intepuit mucro. (Aen. 10.565-70)16 [Even as Aegaeon, who, men say, had a hundred arms and a hundred hands, and flashed fire from fifty mouths and breasts, what time against Jove's thunders he clanged with as many like shields, and bared as many swords; so Aeneas o'er the whole plain gluts his victorious rage, when once his sword grew warm.] Like the Theogony, Virgil's Aeneid is part of the classical background of Milton's Briareos.17 But in the comparison of Satan to Briareos, the Thebaid is more significant than the Aeneid. Milton specifically refers to Briareos, not to Aegaeon, and thus he signals that he has in mind a text other than Virgil's epic. And if Milton were to mention "Aegaeon" rather than "Briareos," the other allusions in his simile would continue to recall Hesiod's Theogony and the battle of the Titans against Jove. Most importantly, Aeneas is too virtuous to be a classical counterpart of Satan in Milton's Leviathan simile. To be sure, Milton contrasts classical and Christian heroism throughout Paradise Lost, and the pagan heroism of Aeneas sometimes parallels the martial exploits of Satan. But Aeneas is known for his pietas, his ferocity in battle is in the name of a good cause, and he wins his war and thus makes possible the founding of Rome. On the other hand, Satan is impius, his prowess in battle is meant to advance himself rather than God, and he loses his war. In the figure of Tydeus, Milton could find a classical hero who has the superficial valor of Satan, yet who is far more reprobate than Aeneas. Milton's comparison of Satan to Briareos reminds us that Statius had compared Tydeus to the same monster. And so Satan is indirectly related to Tydeus through Milton's simile. Perhaps the most significant episode involving Tydeus occurs just be fore his death. After being gravely wounded by Melanippus, Tydeus asks his comrades to bring him Melanippus' head, which Capaneus does (Theb.</page><page sequence="8">THE FALL OF TYDEUS AND THE FAILURE OF SATAN 141 8.716-56). He then gnaws on Melanippus' brain, much to the dismay of Athena, who had planned to bless Tydeus with immortality: iamque inflexo Tritonia patre venerat et misero decus immortale ferebat, atque ilium effracti perfusum tabe cerebri aspicit et vivo scelerantem sanguine fauces? nec comites auferre valent?: stetit aspera Gorgon crinibus emissis rectique ante ora cerastae velavere deam; fugit aversata iacentem, nec prius astra subit, quam mystica lampas et insons Elisos multa purgavit lumina lympha. {Theb. 8.758-66) [And now, her sire appeased, had Tritonia come, and was bringing immortal lustre to the unhappy hero: when lo! she sees him befouled with the shattered brains' corruption and his jaws polluted with living blood?nor can his comrades wrest it from him?: fierce stood the Gorgon with outstretched snakes, and the horned serpents upreared before her face o'ershadowed the goddess; with averted face she flees from him where he lies, nor enters heaven ere that the mystic lamp and Elisos with plenteous water has purged her vision.] So great is Tydeus' transgression that even Mars and Tydeus' comrades are apalled by his behavior: Asperat Aonios rabies audita cruenti Tydeos; ipsi etiam minus ingemuere iacentem Inachidae, culpantque virum et rupisse queruntur fas odii; quin te, divum implacidissime, quamquam praecipuum tunc caedis opus, Gradive, furebas, offensum virtute ferunt, nec comminus ipsum ora, sed et trepidos alio torsisse iugales. (Theb. 9.1-7) [The news of the mad fury of blood-stained Tydeus exasperates the Aonians; even the Inachidae themselves grieve but little for the fallen warrior, and blame him, complaining that he has transgressed the lawful bounds of hatred; nay, thou too, O Gradivus, most violent of Gods, though at that time the furious work of slaughter did most</page><page sequence="9">142 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES occupy thee, thou too wert offended, as they relate, by such hardi hood, nor turned thy own gaze thereon, but drove another way thy affrighted steeds.] Tydeus, unlike Aeneas, becomes emblematic of impietas. His heroism is ne gated by his excessive violence and impropriety. Ovid alludes to the episode in Ibis (A.D. 11), where he writes: "Nec dapis humanae tibi sint fastidia; quaque / Parte potes, Tydeus temporis huius eris" ["nor mayst thou shrink from human flesh; but where thou art strongest thou shalt be the Tydeus of these days"] (lines 427-28). And he later says: "Astacidaeque modo decisa cadavere trunco, / Digna feris, hominis sit caput esca tuum" ["And like Astacides may thy head be cut from thy truncated corpse, and, though deserving of beasts, be food for a man"] (lines 515-16). The myth also ap pears in the Bibliotheca, or Library of classical mythology (ca. A.D. 100), popularly ascribed to Apollodorus. In that account, Amphiaraus, rather than Capaneus, brings Tydeus the head of Melanippus (3.6.8).18 The impietas of Tydeus is underscored by his association with Virgil's Turnus. When he has nearly finished battling his attackers with the strength of Briareos, he boasts: "ite sub umbras, / o timidi paucique!" ["To death with you, cowards and too few!"] (Theb 2.667-68). He then suddenly loses his strength {Theb. 2.668-81). So too, Turnus valiantly battles a throng of Trojan warriors (Aen. 9.731-77).Though victory is at hand for him, he foolishly insists on continuing to fight the Trojans by himself. Juno abandons him, the Trojans attack him, and he is barely able to escape (Aen. 9.788-818). Turnus is attacked "ceu saevum turba leonem / cum telis premit infensis" ["as when a crowd with levelled spears beset a savage lion"] (Aen. 9.792-93). Tydeus, in turn, is like a lion sated with the blood of sheep: "nec iam amplius irae / crudescunt: tantum vacuis ferit aera malis / molliaque eiecta delambit vellera lingua" ["gone is his savage fury, he only snaps in the air his empty jaws, and with hanging tongue licks them clean of the soft wool"] (Theb. 2.679-81). When Tydeus fights at Thebes, he pompously brags of his previous battle, forgetting that he had been overcome by fatigue: "ille ego inexpletis solus qui caedibus hausi / quinquaginta animas: totidem, totidem heia gregatim / ferte manus!" ["I am he who took fifty lives in unsated carnage; bring as many, ay, as many squadrons in swarms!"] (Theb 8.666-68). His rashness leads to his death.19 While Milton knew the Thebaid direcdy, he also knew Statius' myths of Briareos and Tydeus through Dante's powerful interpretation of them in the Commedia. Dante's use of Statius has been heavily documented. As C. S. Lewis and Ernst Robert Curtius have noted, every major character of the Thebaid is mentioned in the Commedia. Edward Moore has summarized Dante's borrow</page><page sequence="10">THE FALL OF TYDEUS AND THE FAILURE OF SATAN 143 ings from Statius, and Teodolinda Barolini has studied Dante's characteriza tion of the Latin poet. And as Ronald Martinez has demonstrated, the city of Thebes is the moral and geographical model for Dante's city of Dis.20 Though Statius was a classical author, Dante made him a secret convert to Christian ity (Purg. 22.64?93), and Statius guides Virgil and the pilgrim through the terraces of Purgatory.21 Milton had an exceptional knowledge of the Commedia. According to David Masson, Milton "must have known his great poem better than any other Englishman alive," and Roy Flannagan remarks that Milton read the Commedia "attentively and reverently."22 He studied Italian before 1625, and during his Cambridge years he read widely in Dante, Petrarch, and other Italian poets. He voices his admiration of Dante and Petrarch in his Apology for Smectym nuus (1642) (CPW1: 890), and in a September 10,1638 letter to Benedetto Buonmattei, he tells of the depth of his study of Italian literature, especially the works of Petrarch and Dante (CPW\: 330). Since Buonmattei was the leading Dante scholar of his time, Milton's comments to him are especially significant. Milton cites Paradiso 20.55-60 in Of Reformation (1641), and he provides an English poetic translation of Inferno 19.115-17 in that work (CPW1: 558-59). In lines 12-14 of his 1646 sonnet to Henry Lawes he refers to the "Casella" episode of Purgatorio 2.76-119. Milton was familiar with the Monarchia and the Vita nuova, and he owned a 1529 third edition of the Convivio. He may have known the editions and commentaries of Cristoforo Landino (1481) and Alessandro Vellutello (1544), and in the entry on "Usury" in his commonplace book, he cites the 1568 commentary of Bernardino Daniello da Lucca {CPW 1: 418). Other references to Dante appear throughout the commonplace book (CPWV. 366,1: 371,1: 384,1: 405,1: 418,1: 476). Neil Forsyth observes that Miltons Hell "is a Vergilian place (with some Dantesque additions)," while Ronald R. Macdonald notes that Milton's "alternating tortures of fire and ice" "might have been lifted intact from the Divine Comedy."23 Dante first mentions Briareos in the Inferno, when the pilgrim asks Virgil if he may see the monster in Hell. Virgil tells the pilgrim that Briareos is much farther on, and that the hundred-handed giant of classical myth is shaped and shackled like the anthropomorphic Ephialtes {Inf. 31.97-105). Later, in the Purgatorio, Dante describes the figure of Briareos carved on a pavement stone: Vedea colui che fii nobil creato piu ch'altra creatura, giu dal cielo folgoreggiando scender, da l'un lato. Vedea Briareo fitto dal telo</page><page sequence="11">144 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES celestial giacer, da l'altra parte, grave a la terra per lo mortal gelo. Vedea Timbreo, vedea Pallade e Marte, armati ancora, intorno al padre loro, mirar le membra d'i Giganti sparte. (Purg. 12.25-33)24 [I saw, on the one side, him who was created nobler than any other creature fall as lightning from heaven. I saw Briareus, on the other side, pierced by the celestial bolt, lying heavy on the ground in mortal chill. I saw Thymbraeus, I saw Pallas and Mars, still armed, around their father, gazing on the scattered limbs of the giants.] In comparing Satan to Briareos, and in stressing the bulk of Briareos's body stretched out on the ground, Dante's account in the Purgatorio was an important source for Miltons comparison of Satan to Briareos in Paradise Lost.25 Dantes source, in turn, was Statius' comparison of Tydeus to Briareos in the Thebaid. Both Statius and Dante mention Phoebus, Pallas, and Mars battling the giant. And if Milton did not initially recognize the primacy of Statius rather than Virgil as Dantes source for the description of Briareos in the Purgatorio, he would have learned this from Daniello's commentary on the passage, which quotes Thebaid 2.596.26 In his Leviathan simile, Milton repeats Dante by showing the aftermath of Satan's rebellion against God. But Milton follows Dante back to the The baid in his description of Briareos. While Dante portrays the vanquished Briareos maimed by thunderbolts, Milton, like Statius, only presents Briareos as a giant who warred on Jove. In the Thebaid, Statius shows Briareos in his moment of glory, proudly battling the Olympian gods. But the fate of Briareos is implicit in Statius' account. And like Briareos, Tydeus will later taste death near the end of Statius's poem, though the warrior fights so ferociously in Thebaid 2. In Milton's simile, the fate of Briareos?and of all others who fight against Jove?is likewise implicit. Soon after Dante's pilgrim yearns to see Briareos in the Inferno, he sees a version of Tydeus eating the head of Melanippus, whom Dante calls "Menalippus." As Count Ugolino devours the brain of Archbishop Ruggieri, Dante describes the scene in terms of the Thebaid: ch'io vidi due ghiacciati in una buca, si che Fun capo a l'altro era cappello; e come'l pan per fame si manduca,</page><page sequence="12">THE FALL OF TYDEUS AND THE FAILURE OF SATAN 145 cosi'l sovran li denti a l'altro pose laVe'l cervel s'aggiugne con la nuca: non altrimenti Tideo si rose le tempie a Menalippo per disdegno, che quei faceva il teschio e Faltre cose. (7/2/32.125-32) [I saw two frozen in one hole so close that the head of the one was a hood for the other; and as bread is devoured for hunger, so the upper one set his teeth upon the other where the brain joins with the nape. Not otherwise did Tydeus gnaw the temples of Menalippus for rage than this one was doing to the skull and the other parts.] Dante indicates that both Tydeus and Ugolino act out of rage. As Mark Musa notes in a gloss on Inferno 33.1-3 in his edition of the Commedia, "As a metaphor, Ugolino's cannibalistic gnawing perfectly captures his gnawing hatred of Ruggieri, a hatred that, as others have noted, characterizes the figure of Ugolino more than anything else. For all eternity, Ugolino punishes himself and Ruggieri by repeating the horrifying circumstances of his im prisonment, punishing his and Ruggieri's sins of brutality with brutality."27 Ugolino's ferocious gnawing is inhuman. Dante calls it a "bestial segno" ["bestial sign"] (Inf. 32.133), and when Ugolino finishes his narrative, he continues to chew Ruggieri s head, his teeth "che furo a Fosso, come d'un can, forti" ["strong on the bone like a dogs"] (Inf. 33.78). The Ugolino episode occurs in Cocytus, which includes sinners pun ished for treachery. Dante and Virgil had been placed on this, the frozen floor of Hell, by Antaeus (Inf. 31.142-45); and in canto 31, Dante had already discussed the rebellious giants of classical myth. The floor of Hell is "al fondo che divora / Lucifero con Guida" ["the bottom that swallows Lucifer with Judas"] (Inf. 31.142-43). Thus Ugolino and Ruggieri, and Tydeus and Me nalippus, are closely associated with Satan. When Dante looks upon Satan, he sees the devil chewing three great sinners: Brutus, Cassius, and Judas (Inf. 34.61-69). While Cassius and Brutus hang their heads outside Satan's mouth, the soul who has the greatest punishment is "Giuda Scariotto, / che'l capo ha dentro e fuor le gambe mena" ["Judas Iscariot, who has his head within and plies his legs outside"] (Inf. 34.62-63). Satan and Judas are analogous to Ugolino and Rugierri and to Tydeus and Menalippus. Dante, then draws a direct connection between Satan and Tydeus.</page><page sequence="13">146 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Through Ugolino s narrative, Dante links the sinner with the crucifixion of Christ. Ugolino explains that as a result of his misplaced trust in Arch bishop Ruggieri, he and his children ended up being imprisoned without food. After a few days, Ugolino bit his hands out of grief, and his children told him, "Padre, assai ci fia men doglia / se tu mangi di noi" ["Father, it will be far less painful to us if you eat of us"] (Inf. 33.61-62). He cryptically says that after his children died of hunger, "Poscia, piu che'l dolor, pote'l digiuno" ["Then fasting did more than grief had done"] (Inf. 33.75).28 Dante then laments: Che se'l conte Ugolino aveva voce d'aver tradita te de le castella, non dovei tu i figliuoi porre a tal croce. (Inf. 33.85-87) [For if Count Ugolino had the name of betraying you of your castles, you ought not to have put his children to such torture.] The plea of Ugolino's children to give up their lives for their father recalls both Isaacs willingness to be sacrificed by Abraham and Christ's voluntary death on the cross. So too, the city of Pisa, Dantes "novella Tebe" ["modern Thebes"] (Inf. 33.89), treats the innocent children like the crucified Christ, as "croce" ["torture" or "cross"] (Inf. 33.87) signifies.29 In Paradise Lost, the transformation of the demons into serpents in Book 10 captures the justice of Dantes poem. When the devil first appears in Paradise Lost, Milton calls him "Th' Infernal Serpent" (PL 1.34). And in his "Leviathan" simile, Milton underscores Satan's serpentine form. Leviathan is "the piercing serpent" and "that crooked serpent" of the Bible (Isa. 27:1); Briareos and the giants have serpent legs (Met. 1.184); and Typhon has a hundred serpent heads (Theog. 825).30 Satan makes his final appearance in Book 10, where he is transformed into a snake: His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, His Arms clung to his Ribs, his Legs entwining Each other, till supplanted down he fell A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone, Reluctant, but in vain: a greater power Now rul'd him. (PL 10.511-16)</page><page sequence="14">THE FALL OF TYDEUS AND THE FAILURE OF SATAN 147 The devils involuntary metamorphosis, along with the catalog of snakes to which the demons are compared (PL 10.524-31), link Satan's final appear ance in Book 10 to his initial mention in Book 1 and to Milton's comparison of the fallen angel to Briareos in the Leviathan simile. Milton says that Satan is "punisht in the shape he sinn'd, / According to his doom" (PL 10.516-17), and the demons are "like in punishment, / As in thir crime" (PL 10.544-45). Satan must repeat his sin by eating ashen fruit: they fondly thinking to allay Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit Chew'd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste With spattering noise rejected: oft they assay'd, Hunger and thirst constraining, drugg'd as oft, With hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws With soot and cinders fill Id; so oft they fell Into the same illusion, not as Man Whom they triumph'd, once lapst. (PL 10.564-72) While Satan is not condemned to eat the ashes perpetually, Milton suggests that the devil is periodically forced to change into a snake and reenact his punishment: Thus were they plagu'd And worn with Famine long, and ceaseless hiss, Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd, Yearly enjoin'd, some say, to undergo This annual humbling certain number'd days, To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't. (PL 10.572-77) The annual consumption of ashes is a fulfillment of the curse that God had placed upon the serpent after Eve's temptation: "Upon thy Belly groveling thou shaft go, / And dust shaft eat all the days of thy Life" (PL 10.177-78). Milton's entire account of Satan's transformation is indebted to Dante. In Inferno 24 and 25, Dante's pilgrim ventures into the valley of the serpents, where he sees thieves punished by snakes. Vanni Fucci is struck by a snake, turns to ashes, and regains his human shape (Inf. 24.97-108); Cianfa, ap parently transformed into a serpent, attacks Agnello and fuses with him into a single grotesque creature (Inf. 25.40-78); and Francesco de' Cavalcanti,</page><page sequence="15">148 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES initially in the form of a snake, reverts to human form while Buoso, whom he attacks, becomes a serpent (Inf. 25.79-141). David Wallace remarks: "Miltons debt to Dante (not as immediately obvious as his debt to Ariosto and Tasso) is profound: the transformation of Satan into a serpent in Para dise Lost, book 9, for example, could scarcely have been written without the Ovidian-inspired precedent of Inferno 25."31 What Wallace says of Para dise Lost 9, in which Satan tempts Eve, can be applied all the more validly to Paradise Lost 10, in which the devil's metamorphosis is an involuntary punishment. According to Irene Samuel, who has discussed at length the influence of Dante's valley of serpents on the transformation of the demons into snakes in Book 10 of Milton's epic, "Only Dante could have suggested to Milton the idea of having the scene represent the penalty exacted by divine justice?that the criminal must go on being and doing involuntarily what he formerly was and did by choice."32 The timing of Satan's final metamorphosis in Paradise Lost is also indebted to Dante. John M. Steadman has observed that while Satan is changed from angel to monster immediately after his fall in numerous me dieval and Renaissance religious, literary, and artistic works, Milton delays Satan's metamorphosis to Book 10.33 Immediately prior to his transformation Satan appears as an heroic orator addressing his demonic troops after the successful damnation of humanity (PL 10.460-503). But with his transfor mation both his appearance and character become bestial. Though he took the form of a serpent when he tempted Eve, his eloquence distinguished him from the other animals. With his involuntary transformation in Book 10, he loses the ability to speak and must savagely chew the ashen fruit. In the Inferno, Dante's pilgrim finally sees Satan at the end of the poem. But the devil has none of the power or beauty of an angel. Instead, Dante strips him of all mystery and glamour by presenting him as a grotesque, shaggy monster eternally trapped in a frozen lake. Most notably, Dante's Satan savagely chews Judas, Cassius, and Bru tus in his three mouths. Milton draws on Dante's characterization of the devouring devil to underscore Satan's bestial nature. Satan brings death to humanity, and Milton casts mortality in terms of eating. He begins his poem by saying that he will write Of Man's First Disobedience, and the Fruit Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal taste Brought Death into the World, and all our woe. (PL 1.1-3)</page><page sequence="16">THE FALL OF TYDEUS AND THE FAILURE OF SATAN 149 He may well be echoing Dante in this passage, as Neil Forsyth has sug gested, since "Disobedience" recalls Dante's "Dis," or Satan (Inf. 11.65,12.39, 34.20).34 Death will happily eat all living things. Satan tells Sin and Death that on Earth, "there ye shall be fed and fill'd / Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey" (PL 2.843-44). When he describes the transformation of the demons into snakes, Milton's language captures the ravenous appetite of Dante's Satan. The serpentine demons are "parent with scalding thirst and hunger fierce" (PL 10.556); they "could not abstain" (PL 10.557); they pluck the fruit "greed ily" (PL 10.560); they "writh'd thir jaws" (PL 10.569); and "Thus were they plagu'd / And worn with Famine long" (PL 10.572-73). In addition, the demons lose the capacity for speech, the outward expression of reason. Satan "would have spoke, / But hiss for hiss return'd with forked tongue" (PL 10.517-18). This inability to speak might be a recollection of Dante's Nimrod, the giant who built the Tower of Babel and is now unable to com municate (Inf. 31.67-81). Dante's Virgil says "Elli stessi s'accusa" ["He is his own accuser"] (Inf. 31.76), a remark that anticipates Milton's explanation of the demons' hissing: Thus was th' applause they meant, Turn'd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame Cast on themselves from thir own mouths. (PL 10.545-47) With his transformation into a serpent, the true nature of Milton's Satan becomes apparent: he resembles Dante's satanic monster chewing the sin ners. He also brings to mind Ugolino, who gnaws on Ruggieri s head as if he were a dog chewing a bone (Inf. 33.78); and possibly the transformed Tydeus, no longer heroic warrior but vengeful madman. In Paradise Lost, then, Milton engages in a complex intertextual rela tionship with the Thebaid and the Commedia. Through his Leviathan simile, Milton links Satan to the rebellious Briareos of the Thebaid. And like Statius' Briareos, who is destined to fail in his battle against Jove, Milton emphasizes Satan's failure in his assault against Heaven. Like the monster to which he is compared, Tydeus fights gloriously in the Thebaid, but he will ultimately fall into disgrace and lose immortality through his desecration of Melanippus' corpse. Satan, too, will valiantly plot the damnation of humanity and his revenge against God, but his actions will ultimately fail. Like Dante's devil chewing the heads of Judas, Cassius, and Brutus; like Ugolino eating the head of Ruggieri; and like Tydeus gnawing on the skull of Melanippus, he</page><page sequence="17">150 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES is transformed into a ravenous monster. The figure of Tydeus, both in the Thebaid and the Commedia, allows Milton to comment on the failings of classical heroism, which Satan so fully manifests throughout Paradise Lost. Like Tydeus, Satan seeks to further his own ambition, and he thus becomes classically impius. By ignoring God's will, just as Tydeus violates the stan dards of pietas that Aeneas had embodied so well, Satan lapses deeper into damnation. Independent Scholar Fairfield, Connecticut Notes 1.
