<plain_text><page sequence="1">Irish Medieval Figure Sculpture 1200-1600: A study of Irish tombs with notes on costume and armour. By John Hunt; with assistance and contributions from Dr P. Harbison. Photographs by David Davison. Volume I: text pp. x + 269, 17 figs. I map; Volume Ii: plates 1-340, with topo graphical index of plates. Published jointly by Sothebv Parke Bernet and Irish University Press, 1974. ?25.00. The publication of this book can be celebrated by everyone concerned with the study of medieval Ireland. John Hunt is to be congratulated grate fully on putting this wealth of informed fact into our hands; and all others who assisted him in this, particularly Dr Harbison, also deserve our thanks. The book has an unfortunate printing history: the initial publishers, Irish Universities Press, went into liquidation during its production (an event to be lamented by Irish scholars) and the appear ance of the two volumes was significantly delayed until Sotheby Parke Bernet took it over and saw it through. These delays necessitated an increase in price of 25% between printing and release; this is regrettable, but the high price should not blind one to the importance and value of this study. The presentation of both volumes is admirable. The text is printed in an attractive and easily readable type face, and the photographs are very well presented. Most of the photographs are of a very high quality. Many of the tombs have never before been adequately photographed and the physical situation of many makes this difficult. Mr Davison has surmounted these obstacles; and has made a major contribution to the work by supplying photographs of monuments which make the detail and original appearance of the figures much more explicit than the usual hackneyed views. For example, and of particular interest to readers of this Journal, his photograph of the O'Cahan effigy at Dungiven is superb; the views of the two Grey Abbey effigies are most inform ative (compare Hunt's pi. 22 with pi. 98.2 in An Archaeological Survey of Co. Down); and occas ionally the excellence of the medieval work and the photography coincide to produce a tour de force, as for example the magnificent lion on the Grace tomb in St Canice's, Kilkenny (pi. 281). Some few of the photographs, such as pls 3 or 190-191, are of poor quality; but these are not Mr Davison's work. The arrangement of the text and plates is awkward. Mr Hunt separates the effigies from the tomb surrounds in his discussion, and in the plates, while the catalogue is divided geographically and alphabetically and moves from tomb to tomb, and from county to county. This difficulty is in part imposed by the intractability of the material; but a more serious fault is the opposing con ventions in the numeration of the two volumes. Thus, in volume 1, catalogue numbers are printed in bold type, and plate references in italics. In volume 11, plate numbers are given in bold type and catalogue numbers in italic; and this can lead to great confusion when trying to relate text to plates. While dealing with layout, one might add that references are at times inadequate, at others absent, and could have been more systematically listed; however, the index appears to be adequate, and no obvious misprints or mistakes caught this reviewer's eye. The map is not adequate - in dull green, with tomb locations in black while modern roads and towns are overlaid in white, it is more 93</page><page sequence="2">suited to a tourist guide than to a major academic work. In his preface Mr Hunt defines the scope of his work, both in period and in subject. Despite M. Roe's recent study of cadaver effigies (Roe 1968) it is a pity that Mr Hunt did not discuss them or at least include them in his numbered catalogue. This omission is particularly unfortunate in the case of the Rice Tomb in Waterford; the importance of this tomb and its thematic unity as shown by Dr Rae (Rae 1971) is disrupted by consideration merely of the surrounds. Similarly Hunt ignores simple slabs which bear no figural motif, and thereby the Antrim and Down 13th century coffin lids, which could have informed his discussion of several themes, for example the sword pommel forms mentioned below. His introduction briefly treats of the historical background and the social and economic milieu which produced the tombs. The account of historical events is at times over-simplistic, but for the most part readable and straightforward. His comments on the early application of English regal attributes to the tombs of Gaelic kings are particularly interesting. This is followed with a discussion of the study of arms and armour, and the limitations of this study in Ireland imposed by the dearth of evidence. To his bare list of what survives can be added the Lough Henney mail (probably a pisane) and fragments of mail from Tullamore, Co. Derry and Ballymena (Ulster Museum 285-1913 and 1911-97). Finds of medieval weapons in Ireland are surprisingly few. Only three swords are known to this writer - those published by Waterman (Waterman 1953), and a third from the Ulster Blackwater near Moy, purchased by the Ulster Museum in 1974. Recent excavations have added some material such as the dagger fragment and arrowheads from Green castle, Co. Down (C. Lynn in Delaney (ed.) 1973). But the corpus of early medieval material is still too slight to be of much help. The absence of funerary groups from churches is a further hindrance - the only such group in Ireland hung in St Nicholas's church, Carrickfergus, until its theft some four years ago. Luckily, at the time of writing there is some hope for its retrieval. However, other sources provide evidence auxil iary to that of the surviving arms and the effigies. Most of the anthropomorphic ornament on medieval pottery is crude, but the recent knight jug from the Dublin excavations showed exception ally good detail in the two dismounted knights (6 Riorddin in Delaney (ed.) 1973). The docu mentary and literary evidence has not been sufficiently explored - there are many contempor ary references to armour in both Irish and English, and many are more trustworthy than Caithreim Toirdea/b/haigh. A good example is the condem nation of the heart-shaped head-dress (Hunt, pis 176, 177) in suitably savage terms in Swayne's Register (Chart (ed.) 1935, 139). i. . . and the Pruyd of Women hedes hath destrude this Londe God that berreth the Crone of thornes destru the prude of Wome homes. . . Most of the 16th century personal portrayals of the Irish are well known, but it is surprising that the Burke genealogies (TCD Ms F 4.13) remain unpublished. This manuscript contains the best extant illustrations of weapons, armour and dress, with long ring-pommel swords, and armours and helms of just the sort found on the tombs. Turning to the metalwork, most of the shrine figures are too stereotyped to be of use. Rynne has called attention to a sword-type depicted on the Breac Maodhoc (Rynne 1962); while the upper side of the Domnach Airgead (Mahr and Raftery 1941, p1. 18) includes tiny mounted figures wearing sallets or bascinets, pisanes, and aketons. Mr Hunt goes on to indicate that the bulk of the effigal monuments depict military men, whose armour is susceptible to dating, and who are sometimes named. These are occasionally accom panied by ladies, who are thereby dated; and the dating thus achieved for the ladies' fashions can be applied to the rare but similarly garbed civilian males. After some comments on cultural 'timelag', he describes the arms, armour and dress of the knights, ladies, civilian males and ecclesiastics, divided into three periods defined thus: Period I 1200-1350; Haitus 1350-1450; Period 11 1450Q1570. There is a certain amount of repetition in the text, whereby factors relating to e.g. 'timelag' are discussed several times (upon occasion with contra dictory effect); other information is also given with unnecessary repetition. This is to some extent due to the awkwardness of arrangement referred to above, but also one suspects that the corpus of material, having been amassed over a number of decades, wasnotexaminedvis avisthe introductory matter in order to eliminate over-lap. More careful editing might have saved space and expense. The problem of 'timelag' is very complex and Mr Hunt suggests some of the factors which should control discussion thereof. While admitting that Ireland might be compared to the Scottish border, where armour could be two to three generations behind that of London, he points out that tombs can be carved substantially before or after the death of the man depicted; and that sculptors occasionally kept and used in portrayal armour otherwise long out of date. The most bizarre Irish archaism is the tomb of James Bermingham at Lusk, Co. Dublin, where a man who died in 1637 is depicted in armour appropriate to a period at least 200 years earlier. Elsewhere in the text he indicates archaism deliberately introduced by the 94</page><page sequence="3">sculptor, as in the Jerpoint cloister (Cat. nos 125e, 125f). Most of the early armour on Irish tombs is fairly up to date; but c. 1400 this development atrophies. Hunt argues persuasively that this is a function of the Irish wars; that a light headguard, and body armour of early type, was more approp riate to the terrain than the 'white armour' coming into use in England. 'The Irish nobility ... had no intention of being immobilized by a great weight of harness and of being butchered in the cause of fashion' (p. 62). He goes on to suggest that not only is the selection of 'archaic' armour deliberate, but that the combination worn in Ireland is eventually adopted by European soldiers as a practical costume of war. This interesting point recalls Lydon's argument that light-armed cavalry, 'sattelites' or 'hobelers' may have constituted an Irish contribution to European warfare (Lydon 1954-6). The discussion of the different items of equipment is enlightening. The Cantwell effigy at Kilfane is mentioned; it is pointed out that it is identified as c. 1330 because of the rowel spurs, but that such spurs occur in two other Irish contexts in a pre-t300 date; and that the Kilfane effigy could possibly be of that date too. The discussion of swords with multi-lobate pommels is interesting - he accepts them as a British Isles continuity with the Viking types - but here reference could have been made to the Ulster slabs, especially the fine lobate pommel carved on a slab at Bangor (An Archaeological Survey of Co. Down, pl. 111, Bangor lid 3) or at Knocknagor church, Co. Down. An interesting early reference to these hilts is quoted, from Count John de Perilhos's descriptions of an O'Neill and his retinue '. . . the pommel and the hilt are of another kind, the pommel is like an extended hand . . .' (Mahaffy 1919, 7). Mr Hunt leaves no doubt as to the value of the Lough Henney helmet (Ulster Museum 1911-951) - the only surviving link between early Italian bascinets and the later armets and barbuts, he terms it 'one of the most important armour documents in Europe'. Going on to discuss the late medieval weapons, he mentions the long ring-pommel 16th century swords used by the nobility, and to Hayes-McCoy's list (Hayes-McCoy 1959) adds an example in the possession of the Marquis of Waterford. These long light blades may be distinguished from the shorter (although similar) 'flatchets' of the ordinary kerns; and it is significant that at least two of the six examples now known bear a knob of silver above the ring, these from Portglenone (Hayes McCoy 1959, fig. 3) and near Ram's Is., Lough Neagh, recently acquired by the Ulster Museum. The catalogue lists almost all tombs known to Mr Hunt which fall within his specifications. It is a very full list indeed, and many tombs are included which have hitherto been largely unknown and unpublished - for example, the effigy at Ratoath (no. 201). 1 am surprised that he does not include and illustrate the interesting Aghalurcher slab despite mentioning it in the discussion (p. 47). One feels that more reference to the architectural material would be worthwhile. Jerpoint cloister is included and discussed, while other cloistral carvings are not; and other sculptures are ignored, which must have influenced the effigal workshops, e.g. the font at Rathmore (Roe 1968, pl. xxxix) which was probably carved in the atelier which produced the tomb no. 200. Hunt includes architectural fragments occasion ally where they inform a discussion, and one would have liked more of these - for example, why include the female head from St Canice's (Cat. no. 133), while ignoring the very fine carvings by the same hand at Gowran (Stalley 1972, pl. 36). To discuss the catalogue in detail, or even selected items, would prolong this review unduly. The descriptions are on the whole precise and informative, with most valuable detail, although the absence of dimensions is to be regretted. There is occasional confusion of terminology: for example, the description of the 'Brethren' mail is correct - 'represented by transverse bands' (p. 173) - yet compare the account of the Graig namanagh effigy - 'armed in transversely banded mail' (pl.'71). While this is probably unintentional, it does recall the fictitious 19th century notion that the sculptors' modes of mail representation reflected varying different models, and such descriptions could present traps to the unwary. He discusses the Shantallow (Derry) slab and the theory that it came from Coleraine without result, and describes it as being of 1560-1570 English type. Clearly, petrological analysis is required here - as elsewhere. Mr Hunt does not refer to Waterman's seminal paper on the utilisation of English West Country stone in Irish buildings (Waterman 1970), and the important fact that the Jerpoint Felix O'Dulany (O Dubhshlaine) effigy is of Caen stone is ignored. He rightly rejects the 1385 ascription of the Dungiven tomb; both the effigy and the gallowglass figures must date to the late 15th century, with the tracery. Following Dr Rae's work, he comments on the Renaissance excellence of the Archbishop Wellesley monu ment at Great Connell, Co. Kildare (Rae 1971) and draws attention to two incongruities - a miniature sheela-na-gig beneath the slab at the archbishop's head, and above the 'Ecce Homo' panel a small figure aiming a handgun. One fault in the Catalogue is a certain incon sistency or uncertainty in the use of personal names. For example, the inscription on the Abbey leix tomb (Cat. no. 170) uses the form 'MALACHIAS'. This is translated as 'Melaghlin'; but appears in the caption as 'Malachy'; and other 95</page><page sequence="4">examples of such discrepancy could be cited. One can occasionally disagree with the descriptions - for example the tomb of William and Mary Goer (pl. 114), carved in a flattish low relief, is described as degenerate, yet I find it an almost sophisticated stylization, and the protective sweep of her cloak over his feet both innovatory and compassionate. But in general the Catalogue is a work of great thoroughness and clarity, and, with the plates, is full of good things. The book concludes with three useful appen dices - a list, with references, of missing sculpture; a list of iconographic figures with their individual attributes; and a list of pre-1600 tombs in the 'Elizabethan' style. Finally there is a useful glossary - although this is occasionally a little naive, as for example 'spere - old word for spear', or pleonastic, viscera - bowels'. The list of Irish tombs of pre 1600 date but of 'Elizabethan' style is a most useful appendix. For Mr Hunt to exclude them from his discussion is quite valid, yet one hopes that this isolated group of important monuments will soon receive attention, as (despite its title) Mr Potterton's book scarcely lights on them (Potterton 1975). The points raised in this review have been supplementary rather than critical, and this reflects how stimulating it is to have this magisterial corpus made available at last. Accompanied with the detailed studies of the scholars mentioned above, our figural and other sculpture is finally being explored and interpreted - and this study is made all the more important by the dearth of material, bare remnants of what once existed, but has been reduced and fragmented by warfare, vandalism, and official apathy. It is of the utmost importance that these monuments become well known and appreciated, as their present neglected state leaves them open to damage and loss - for example, the shattered effigy at Castlelost, Co. Westmeath (Cat. no. 259) or the smiling figure of St Dominic (Cat. no. 62, pl. 264) stolen from the friary at Athenry. Mr Hunt's work will do much to provide the informed public which alone can prevent this steady diminution of our cultural past - a public which can now for the first time place in context a most important part of Irish medieval culture, a medium whereby the life of the past occasionally communicates directly with the present; and also death, for we should recall that the tombs stand as witnesses, memorials to the dead, and warning and inspiration to the living. This review fittingly concludes with this inscription from Kilmore, Co. Meath (no. 196). No one ought to be grieved at death, since in living there is labour and danger while in dying there is peace and the assurance of resurrection: pray for the soul of Rory MeMahon who had me made.' T.
