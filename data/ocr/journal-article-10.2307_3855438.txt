<plain_text><page sequence="1">(52) GRAFFITI AT THE WADI EL-'ALLAKI By JAROSLAV CERNY IN 1941 Mr. Guy Brunton of the Cairo Museum handed over to the present writer, on behalf of Mr. G. W. Murray, Director of the Topographical Survey, a series of photographs of graffiti accompanied by a few notes on the region and on the sites where the graffiti occur, with a view to their examination and publication. The study of the material so kindly entrusted to me and the preparation of an article were already well CAR ROUTE "ALLAQI - HALFA. t / M ile5 l /^~ O/ C)~~DakkaO //t - AIla enChephren Q9u3 e cs ani f e/Aar.

It was not until April I947 that the photographs and notes reached me again in London, rendering it possible at last to take definite steps towards their publication in the present article. In the meantime Miss Rosalind Moss had obtained another series of the same photographs, but on hearing that I had already been engaged in the writing of an article on this subject she very kindly sur- rendered her claims in my favour. The photographs were taken in December I940 by Mrs. Murray during her and her husband's trip through the Wadi el-'Allaki, which leaves the Nile Valley near the Nubian town El-'Allaki situated almost opposite Dakka; I owe Mr. Murray's sketch- map of their journey (fig. i) to the kindness of Miss Moss.

The inscriptions come from the lower reaches of the wadi, mostly from the two sites of Hukab Karrar and Hukab el-'Askar respectively one and two days' march (25 and 54 kilometres) from the Nile. A natural arch and sandstone cliffs at Hukab Karrar afford the first shelter from the north wind that the traveller to the mines meets with after plodding over the sand-waste east of the Nile, while Hukab el-'Askar is a rocky 'island' (2 F, pI. XI, i) in the middle of the Wadi el-'Allaki where a filled-in excavation and numerous potsherds seem to give evidence of an ancient attempt to sink a well. This rock marks the geological boundary between the Nubian sandstone and the meta- morphic area and the site at the base of the rock was no doubt selected as the furthest point from the Nile where a deep shaft could be sunk without encountering very hard rock.2 A certain number of the photographs are rather blurred and the inscriptions on them difficult to read; only a selection of the best could therefore be published on pls. IX ff. All graffiti, however, have been transcribed, described, or at least mentioned below. The letters and numbers of all photographs on which a graffito is visible have been added.3 The arrows &lt;- or -&gt; indicate the direction in which figures of men or animals look, and the inscriptions run from right to left unless otherwise stated.

Serv. xxxviII, 369-90) the last well was similarly sunk at the junction of the sandstone with the metamorphic rocks. 3 The whole series of photographs has been deposited in the Griffith Institute, where they will be available for any further consultation. 4 The existence of 2 only is doubtful; J had not been chalked out before the photograph was taken but none the less is clearly shown.

Immediately below this stela another, rectangular, but broader stela has been added, overlapping the upper stela to the right by about half the width of the latter.

With the exception of the last three, nos. 41 to 43, which are probably of Middle Kingdom date, all the graffiti belong to the New Kingdom, or more precisely to the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties, as is shown both by their palaeography and by the proper names occurring in them. This is confirmed by the sole dated graffito, no. 27, dated in year 40, which-Tuthmosis III being excluded on palaeographical grounds-can refer only to Ramesses II, as no other N.K. ruler reigned so long. It is noticeable that so far as the contents of the graffiti are concerned, there is but little to excite our interest, for most of them consist solely of titles and proper names. Even the latter are mostly quite common and add but little to our knowledge of the personal names current during the New Kingdom. The only names not hitherto attested are Nl-swyt of no. 15; Inziwy of no. 17; Tnr-hri of no. i9 and Rcmssw-hr of no. 26. What really is interesting about these graffiti is the very fact of their existence I I was unable to find any information concerning Dungash. 56</page><page sequence="9">GRAFFITI AT THE WADI EL-'ALLAKI in the Wadi el-'Allaki. They prove that this was the route taken by travellers to reach the farther end of the gold-mining country at Umm el-Garayat, a description of which by Bonomi can be found in Wilkinson, Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians (ed. Birch), II, 238.' It is probably the road so gloomily described in the Kuban stela (11. 9-I0 and 20) of Ramesses II2 and the excavation at Hukab el-'Askar may be, as Mr. Murray suggests, the actual well sunk by Ramesses and described in the inscript- ion. The stela itself comes from Kuban, which was situated not far north of the point where the Wadi el-'Allaki leaves the Nile Valley. The ancient name of Kuban was B;k, and this is the place whence the scribe Nebentere, son of Hori, is said to have come (no. 20). The local god was Horus, so it is not a matter for surprise that several ex- votos to Horus 'lord of Bak' are found among the graffiti (nos. 38 a-c; also, though not expressly named, in nos. 14, 22, 24, and 37 [together with Amuiin]). He is certainly identical with 'Horus, son of Isis' of no. 39 and probably it is he who is meant by 'His lord' in no. II.3 No traveller of high rank is recorded in the graffiti on this lonely track. The most distinguished perhaps were the 'King's Commissioner to all foreign countries'4 of no. 22 and the 'mayor and prophet' of no. 3I. 'Mayor' (h;ty-c) at this period was the title of the head of a nome, and Kuban was the capital of a Nubian district, the equivalent of a nome in Egypt proper. All the other graffiti belong to persons of low rank; 'retainers' (s'msw) (nos. 9 and 12); 'chiefs of retainers' (nos. 15 and 23); 'chief of the stable' (no. I3); 'soldier' (no. 17); 'servants' (sdm) (nos. 19 and 26); and 'deputy' (no. 36). We translate s e v smsw as 'retainer' because in the M.K. this title was commonly borne by armed men attendant on king or baron, but in the Ramesside period the smsw seem in most cases to be letter-carriers,5 and it is possible that the four men of this rank who passed through the Wadi el-'Allaki did so to deliver correspon- dence from or to the mining district. The majority of travellers, however, were 'scribes'. One was 'scribe of the quarter' (no. 25), the 'quarter' being probably a subdivision of the Kuban district; one was 'scribe of the treasury' (no. 27). The latter and another (no. 30) were scribes 'who counted the gold', and therefore were certainly stationed at the mines. The 'scribe Nebentere, son of Hori' seems to have been a much-travelled person. Not only has he left four graffiti along the Wadi el-'Allaki (nos. II, 20, 2I, 28), but we meet his name on rocks farther down the Nile between Kalabshah and Dendur6 and near Umbarekab,7 and upstream near Tonkalah.8 He is perhaps identical with 'the retainer Nebentere' found at Tushka.9 'His lord' for whom he made a graffito there is not Horus, as one would expect on the strength of our graffito no. Ii, but a Juu the deified conqueror of Nubia Sesostris III. I I owe this reference to Kees, Aegypten (in Kulturgeschichte des alten Orients), p. 129, no. 6. 2 Tresson, La stele de Koubdn (Cairo, 1922); translated by Breasted, Anc. Rec., III, ?? 285-93. 3 See, however, n. 9 below for a graffito where nb'f refers to the deified king Sesostris III. 4 For this title see Steindorff, JEA xxv, 31 f. 5 Cf. e.g. Cerny, Late Ramesside Letters, 9, 7; 17, IO; 67, 3. 6 Weigall, Antiquities of Lower Nubia, p. 76. 7 Roeder, Debod bis Kalabsheh, pl. i 18, d. 8 Weigall, op. cit., II3. 9 Ibid., pl. 66, right. 57</page></plain_text>
