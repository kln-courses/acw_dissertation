<plain_text><page sequence="1">Environmental Variation and the Plausibility of Religion: A California Indian Example* JAMES V. SPICKARDt Coast Miwok Indian religion before the European conquest of California appears to have been bimodaL Its public face - a world-renewal cult - brought together peoples from surrounding regions in great celebrations. More privately, sorcery pitted neighbor against neighbor, village against village. This essay - an exercise in historical reconstruction - argues that the variable California environment let both aspects of this religion make sense, but at different times and to different degrees. The Coast Miwok environment was rich in resources, but each was subject to periodic failure. In most years there was enough food for all, and the common ceremonies were an expression of good fortune. In bad years, all sought common renewal. In some years, however, only certain lineages' resources might faiL Because all property was private, and there was no system of redistribution, sorcery "explained" (and provided retribution for) such inequities in fortune. In each situation, one or another aspect of native religion "made sense." Contradictions in a religion are nothing new. Many religions contain seemingly antagonistic elements which nonetheless coexist in the lives of their adherents. Observers explain the coexistence of such contradictions in several ways. They may be political: the result of a religion attempting to appeal to two (or more) social groups, each of which takes part of the religion for its own (Levin, 1980). They may be fumctional: contradictory beliefs often preventing groups from acting in ways that might compromise their survival (as implied by Pagels, 1979). Or they may be purely theoretical: matters of dispute among theologians rather than among everyday religious adherents. I wish to suggest another possibility, perhaps of less generality than these, but having the virtue of focusing directly on the tangible world in which religious adherents live. The Coast Miwok Indians of central California had a bimodal religion of great contradictoriness, which, I believe, was made plausible for them by the variability of their environment. On the one hand, there was the Kuksu cult, a yearly or quarterly-yearly ceremony of renewal, which brought together members of different kin-groups and vilages in common undetaking. On the other hand, there was almost daily contact with malevolent spirits and with sorcery, which set kin-groups and villages against one another. I believe that these two aspects of their religion made sense of the Coast Miwoks' natural world, but at different times in the cycle of variation to which their California ecosystem was prone. Group celebrations made sense either when the environment provided sufficient food for all, or provided it for none. More often, however, some lineages Earlier versions of this paper were presented at the 1984 Annual Meeting of the Association for the Sociology of Religion and the 1985 Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Religon tJames V.

Sorcery provided a plausible explanation for such a state of affairs. As we shall see, the situation is complex, and Coast Miwok religion also focused (and defused) intra-group tensions arising out of their system of resource ownership. But I wish to concentrate on the religion from the inside. Aside from its social functions, what led this religion's adherents to affirm it as true? I shall not argue that Coast Miwok religion was environmentally determined; rather, the variable California environment lent that religion a plausibility that a more consistent system of ritual and belief would not have had. HISTORICAL RECONSTRUCTION This essay is, of course, an historical reconstruction. The Coast Miwoks, who lived in the hill-country of Marin and Sonoma counties, north of San Francisco Bay, have not existed as a functioning society for nearly 150 years.' When the Spanish came to Alta California, many Miwoks were herded into missions, where most died of malnutrition and disease. With the annexation of California by the United States, Indian hunting became a popular sport. Anthropologists arrived on the scene only as the Indians were being driven to extinction (Cook, 1943a, 1943b, 1943c, 1978; Heizer &amp; Almquist, 1971). Two of the last three Miwoks were interviewed by ethnographers in the 1930's (Kelly, 1978: 414).2 By then, they were recalling the experiences of their grandparents rather than reporting on a life they had once lived. Their religion in particular had changed. In the late 1800's a series of anti-white cults, offspring of the famous Ghost Dance, swept through the area (DuBois, 1939; Kroeber, 1904; Bean &amp; Vane, 1978). How are we to reconstruct a way of life and thought that ceased to function this long ago? Several factors make this task possible, if not as certain of success as we would like. First, the land remains. The California environment is not a constant, the erroneous supposition of many observers. Rather it is variable, and this variability is significant for the period I am seeking to recreate. I hypothesize that the variability of the California's microclimates, particularly the unsteadiness of local food supplies, is the key element supporting the believability of the two poles of Miwok religion. Second, early diaries and mission documents sometimes report on native life and practices, though not with an anthropologist's eye.3 These records must be read carefully, however, remembering that the Spanish were viewing California's relative lushness through eyes accustomed to the dryness of Mexico and the drought and poverty of southern Spain.4 The archaeological record provides further clues (see Heizer, Elsasser &amp; Clewlow, 1970) and we have the evidence of neighboring peoples that were not so quickly destroyed by 1. The chief sources of information on the Coast Miwok are Kelly (1931-2, 1978); Barrett (1908); and Merriam (1907, 1916). 2. There were never many Coast Miwok. Cook (1943a: 181-3, 1943b: 99, 105) estimates 2000 aboriginally, declining to 5 by 1920. 3. For example: Costanso (1970); Fages (1911); Palou (1913).

Particularly the Pomo, the Miwok's neighbors to the north, possessed a similar culture, environment, society and technology, though the evidence points to a less rigid system of private property, a key element in my analysis.5 Given all this, I believe that we can plausibly reconstruct the life of this vanished society, and can investigate the social/environmental bases of their religious life. The picture I shall present is not certain, but it is intriguing enough to warrant the exercise. Our first task will be to describe the two contrasting elements of the Coast Miwok's religious system. Then I shall outline the social and environmental relations that I believe gave each sense in native eyes. THE KUKSU CULT The religious system that anthropologists label "Kuksu" is a cluster of cults and dances common to many of the peoples north of the San Francisco Bay (Loeb, 1932, 1933; Kroeber, 1932; Bean &amp; Vane, 1978). Each village and language group had its own version of the rites, which varied as widely as the rites of our modem denominations. The system as a whole was nameless - "kuksu" is an Eastern Pomo word for one of the gods impersonated in its dance. Miwok informants referred to "ghost" ceremonies, a Bird cult, and a "kuksui" impersonation that were undoubtedly part of the cycle. Kuksu was a religion of public festival. At certain times of year people gathered from several villages for days of celebration. At this festival men (and sometimes women) were initiated into secret societies, were given status as leaders, and underwent complex rites and formal instruction to signify their elevation. This was the only time that the members of a village's several kin-groups worked together. All other work took place within the family group. The performance of the entire cycle was regarded as a key to "world-renewal," i.e., the setting of things back into their proper course so that all could prosper. Many rites were "first-fruits" ceremonies, which opened the season on certain resources, especially salmon, acorns, tobacco and in one instance datura (probably a post-occupation crop). Others heralded the coming of spring and the end of the time of scarcity (Loeb, 1932, 1933). In general the cult brought people together, though as knowledgeable commentators have noted, "the individualistic character of the religion as practiced in any local group meant that the religious system provided boundaries that bolstered group identity" (Bean &amp; Vane, 1978: 665). Cult festivals were times of intense social activity. Otherwise hostile neighbors were made welcome, gifts were given and received, and people engaged in considerable gambling, trade and other social activities. Society was supposd to be set right along with the world- order. Thus people were enjoined to be kind to their neighbors, to settle feuds, and to treat their guests with respect. If humans acted appropriately, the world would continue to work, whether automatically (as among the Miwok) or through the pleasing of an anthropomorphic deity (as among the Yuki, Eastern Pomo and Maidu). 5. On the Pomo, see Aginsky and Aginsky (1967); Barrett (1908, 1917a, 1917b, 1952); Bean and Theodoratus (1978); Freeland (1923a, 1923b); Gifford (1926, 1967); Kunkel (1962); Loeb (1926); McLendon and Lowy (1978); McLendon and Oswalt (1978); and Theodoratus (1974).</page><page sequence="4">330 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION Among the Miwok, the cult served for male initiation, as well as yearly renewaL Unlike some Pomo groups, all boys were included (Kelly, 1978: 421). This was the only social grouping which cut across lineages (though it may be that cult positions were inherited on kin lines). Since the Miwok reportedly traded less with their neighbors than did other groups (Kelly, 1978: 419), such ceremonies were practically the only time at which intervfllage contact was made. It is significant that this contact occurred under the banner of group- and world-continuance. It apparently took a big issue to get the Miwok to work together. SORCERY Alongside this public religion there was a private systen of reations with supernatural powers. The hills and valleys of the Miwok world were thought to be filled with dangerous beings - some human - in wait for the unwary. To meet a water-spirit or a ghost could produce illness. To meet a bear was unlucky for the hunter (or perhaps for the bear), but to meet a Bear Doctor was usually fataL These were-bears possessed powerful magic that made their attack irresistible. Bears by night and old men - perhaps neighbors - by day, they were greatly feared (Barrett, 1917b; Freeland, 1923a).6 Not all powers were eviL Luck, a supernatural attribute gotten by means of private rituals, was sought for help in hunting and gambling. Personal spirit helpers were sought for help with medicine and other skills. But the Miwok's greatest fear was of supernatural poisoning. They believed that nearly everyone might secretly want to murder, and that many possessed the spiritual power to do so (Kelly, 1978: 419-21). Contact with others, aside from one's own extended family, was hazardous. Bits of one's hair, nail-parings, saliva, excrement or semen must not be allowed to fall into the hands of an enemy, for these could be used against one magically to cause disease. Such substances - all symbolic of bodily boundaries - gave the poisoner control over one's inner self (see Douglas, 1966; chs. 8 and 9). For example, a few strands of hair, when tied to a poison bundle and thrown into the victim's hut, could cause death. The record is full of deliciously detailed tehniques of magical destruction (see Kelly, 1931-2; Loeb, 1926: 330ff; Aginsky &amp; Aginsky, 1967).7 Every family trained at least one of its members in the cure of sorcery. This meant that every family had its own sorcerer, as the skills were the same. One ensorceled one's enemies, and protected one's kin; the division of the village into lkn-groups was the key to the system. Since the poison was introduced into the body by magical means, the most powerful counter-magic involved its removaL The principal technique was sucking, and the wakel?cpi or sucking doctor was regarded as a powerful curer. Other techniques involved singing 6. Kelly (1978: 423) remarks: "Presumably there were bear shamans in former times, but bear impersonations as my informants knew them [in 1932] were simply bandits ... disguised in order to rob and kill." 7. Loeb (1926: 334) comments about Pomo sorcery fears: "The dread of poisoners has 1) hindered the amalgamation of villages and tended to induce community isolation; 2) produced strict rules of hospitality and etiquette; 3) bettered the lot of the old, who were supposedly well-versed in the arts of poisoning; 4) induced stringent systems of sanitation; 5) played its part in the taboo on the use of personal names."</page><page sequence="5">ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION AND THE PLAUSIBILITY OF RELIGION 331 and dancing and the administration of purges, the latter appropriate because not all poisoning was magical. (The Miwok knew quite well the effect of wild iris root in one's mush.) Though cult activities among their neighbors included curing, this does not seem to have been the case with the Miwok (Kelly, 1978: 420-1). Both poisoning and curing were handled privately, counter to the moral preachings of the Kuksu religion on village harmony. But it was not only the body that could be poisoned. The attack could be more subtle, i.e., on one's food supply rather than one's health. A sorcerer could destroy hunting luck, could cause oak moths to invade one's trees, could drive away game and ruin one's gathering grounds. As we shall see, the California environment was such that no one actually starved, but a family under attack could lose considerable wealth. And with a restricted diet, all might suffer illness. Where the cult dances and seasonal ceremonies stressed peace, proper order and social/environmental renewal, sorcery set kin-group against kin-group, village against village (Heizer &amp; Elsasser, 1980: 209). Illness and economic deprivation did not result in people drawing together, but set neighbor against neighbor, until either the situation bettered and tension subsided, or until a death occurred and the relatives of the victim went on with their lives (and, of course, with their revenge). EXPLANATIONS Anthropologists traditionally explain sorcery beliefs as outlets for social tension. Evans-Pritchard (1937) points out that for the Azande, to accuse someone of magical ill- will is to accuse that person of violating social norms. This brings tensions to the surface where they may be alleviated. Difficulties between individuals then become matters for group management. But the Miwok lacked the harmonizing institutions which allowed the resolution of the tensions that sorcery expressed. Other than the Kuksu cult, the Miwok lacked any harmonizing institutions at all. What is the point in using the symbolism of sorcery to bring social conflict to public view, if the public is not going to resolve it? Miwok sorcery, indeed, was something private and dark, about which no one spoke. Only the Kuksu cult brought people together, and it existed not to settle sorcery disputes, but despite them. As far as the cult was concerned, sorcery did not exist - or more exactly, sorcery was an unfortunate phenomenon which should be brushed under the rug in the interests of group unity. The usual explanation of sorcery therefore misses something for the Miwok: specifically, what made sorcery seem plausible to them? If social tensions existed, and the Miwok certainly had them, why should they be symbolized as malevolent magic? Here, as we shall see in a moment, environmental factors have something to offer.8 Likewise, the traditional explanation of the Kuksu cult misses something. Bean and Vane (1978) see it as "administrative": the cult provided status to cult participants and "regulated" the yearly economic cycle. This assumes that the desire for status is a human 8. I specifically oppose Douglas's (1970,1982) purely social explanation of such symbolism (see Spickard, 1984).</page><page sequence="6">332 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION universal, which it may be; and, more dubiously, that the yearly cycle is something that innately needs regulating. (These assumptions are perhaps artifacts of our own worldview.) No doubt the cult strengthened intra- and intervillage ties, which for the Miwok, perhaps more than for neighboring groups, were weak. It provided opportunities for trade, which were also lacking, but unlike cults in some societies, it did not redistribute wealth. The Miwok lacked any such system of redistribution. The traditional explanation leaves out the overt rationality of cult beliefs. It implies that religious institutions possess only social functions, and the ideas of the natives about what they are doing are at best irrelevant, at worst delusion. Undoubtedly the Kuksu cult had certain social consequences, status and intergroup solidarity among them. But it seems to me that the plausibility of cult activities for the natives should be a key element in our analysis, though not the only one. Once again, environmental factors, I believe, illumine the changing focus of cult events - at times on social peace and continuance, at other times on world renewal. In the light of social and ecological factors, the two poles of the Miwok religious system seem to me to form a plausible response to the world, from the native's point of view. The time has come, then, to examine the Coast Miwok's socio-environmental context. MIWOK SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT The Coast Miwok were a settled village people exploiting a varied ecosystem. Rainy winters and long, dry summers provided a seasonal mix of foods, but also required their full utilization. Their forests provided acorns and buckeyes, grasslands gave them seeds, roots and greens. The northwest border of San Francisco Bay gave them access to shellfish and waterfowl. Deer, rabbits, and other game were relatively abundant. Basically hill country, their valleys and draws provided good hunting and gathering, such that many villagers never traveled out of their own territory of 20-30 square miles. Since the area was heavily populated and neighboring villages were often hostile, free movement was not really possible (Kelly, 1978: 419). The Miwok were organized into tightly bounded residential kin-groups which "owned" food resources, each holding gathering rights to certain tracts for each of the major crops (Kelly, 1978: 418). A given kin-group, based more on residence and loyalty than on descent (Kunkel, 1974), would own the gathering rights to acorns from certain stands of oaks, rights to hunt deer in certain draws, and collecting rights to certain tracts of wild herbs. Property rights were jealously guarded. Even to cross into the territory of a neighboring village was a danger, and to encroach on the gathering grounds of others brought prompt retribution. Only rabbits and smaller rodents seem to have been huntable in common, and although they were a useful resource, they were not a staple crop. A village of 200-300 souls would be made up of 4-8 kin-groups, which intermarried but always maintained their separateness. (In-marrying spouses were not generally trusted until several children had been born.) As communal working units, these families harvested the fruit of their possessions under the (loose) direction of their older members. There were no interfamily work groups other than those connected with the Kuksu cult, and no village-wide institutions for the redistribution of surplus. Unlike the Yokuts to the south, the headman was essentially powerless, an encourager of morality rather than a</page><page sequence="7">ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION AND THE PLAUSIBILITY OF RELIGION 333 governor (Heizer &amp; Elsasser, 1980: 209). Most of the time no government was needed. Each extended family was self-sufficient, and generally lived well in a relatively stable environment. Those of us who have lived in rural California for the last fifteen years, however, know something about this purported environmental "stability." The steady weather patterns of the middle part of our century have been, historically ing, a climatological anomaly (Boly, 1983:92; see also Glantz, 1981). The preceding two centuries saw much more year- to-year variation in temperature, in rainfall and, as a result, in environmental productivity. The area in which the Coast Miwok lived was particularly susceptible to environmental variation. The coastal mountains they inhabited are dominated by a series of micro-limates (see Blau, 1985). Not only do temperatures and rainfall vary considerably from year to year, but in any given year they vary from valley to valley and hillside to hillside. Where one location will be productive in a given year, another will not. In other years the situation is reversed. Even in the recent, regular period, variation has been considerable.9 Between 1950 and 1965, for example, Kentfield averaged 47.6 inches of rain per winter, but received as much as 71.52 and as little as 29.24 - as it happens, back to back in the 1957/8 and 1958/9 rainy seasons - with a standard deviation over the pejiod of 14.7. Nearly 33 inches fell there in December 1955, compared to about 1/2 inch a year later. In January 1921, one of the few months that the weather service maintained two stations close to one another, Kentfield had 11 inches to Tamalpais's 4, in the first case a greater than normal rainfall, in the second, less (climatological data from Weather Bureau, U.S. Department of Commerce). Figures for the last century are similar. A somewhat drier locale reported as much as 46.62 and as little as 9.96 inches (between 1865/6 and 1901/2), with a mean of 24.43 and a standard deviation of 7.62 (McAdie, 1903: 57). Rainfall does not necessarily predict the availability of food, of course, but it shows the environmental fluctuation to which I am pointing. For the Coast Miwok, this fluctuation means that one family's gathering grounds were watered while another's went (relatively) dry. More likely, in a dry year one family's resources would squeak by and another's would fail. And this failure was unpredictable. Another drought would see different resources succeed. The same families did not always come out ahead. This variation had a particularly important impact on the acorn crop, the dietary staple. While the oaks owned by one kin-group might bear prolifically in a given year, those owned by another might prove barren. In any event, oaks bear a good crop only one year in three; in a given year, two-thirds of the oaks fail to produce well (Heizer &amp; Elsasser, 1980: 98). Sometimes they do not bear; at other times oak moths destroy the crop, but not uiniformly. Some gathering grounds would be hard hit, while others were spared. 9. There are few weather reporting stations in Marin county, and'none of these have operated for the entire period. Stations are widely spaced, making a quantitative test of my microclimatic hypothesis difficult. For rainfall data from the last century, see Greely and Glassford (1891). For this century, the Weather Bureau, U.S. Department of Commerce, has climatological data. For long-term data from southern California, see Glantz (1981).</page><page sequence="8">334 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION The same was true for buckeyes and seeds, the replacement staples. Herbs would grow or not grow depending on the weather, but as the weather would affect different plots differently, families would not all share the same fate. To some extent this unpredictable variation was alleviated by an equivalent of the European split-field system. A family would own gathering rights in several locations, so the failure of any one would not bring disaster. But this did not entirely solve the problem. Some groves would still produce while others did not. The yearly variation in productivity between kin-groups was a dominant - and mysterious - fact of life. Animal populations were not so variable. The productivity of a family's deer lands could be improved by firing the chaparral to increase grasses, providing some control over fortune. In a rainless year deer would be scarce, but everyone would suffer together. Hunting was difficult with the snares and small bows available at the time, as the preparatory hunting rituals suggest: four days and nights in a sweat lodge and abstinence from sex, meat and oil all reduced body odor enough so one could come close to one's prey. Bringing that prey back was another matter. Hunting was, in the end, a matter of luck. On the other hand, anadromous fish, which were much more plentiful than today, were available to all in-groups. But they varied from year to year, as they do at present.'0 Shellfish were a more-or-less dependable animal resource for those on the coast and bay, though not for those inland. Overall, between 40 and 60 percent of the diet was acorns, with meat taking up most of the remainder, supplemented by fish, shellfish and seeds (Heizer &amp; Elsasser, 1980: 83, 86). Usually families tried to collect two years' supply of food in any one year to ride out potential lean times. But late winter and early spring among the Coast Miwok were often a time of need (Kelly, 1978: 415). Of course, "common sense" might suggest that if one family's resources failed, they should be able to get help from others. Among the Yokuts of south-central California, the village headman was a focus for redistribution, "taxing" the rich to give to the poor (Gayton, 1976). But for the Miwok and Pomo this was not the headman's role. The social boundaries between kin-groups and between villages were so great that cooperation across them was next to impossible. All that kept those whose resources had failed from want was their savings from the past, and the faith that the next year the resources would succeed, when some other kin-group would get the short end of the stick. Let us be clear about my point. I am not claiming that native Californians suffered frequent famine. Nowhere in native California did skeletons have "Harris lines" (signs of lack of calories in childhood [R. Edwards, personal communication]), though the Miwok burned their dead, and so evidence may sinply be lacking. But as Kroeber put it, it was not a fraction of the resources that were utilized; it was rather the bulk; and a material increment to the population would undoubtedly have resulted in hardship.... The Californian could not go for 10. Early anthropologists did not record the yearly variation in fish runs. As Netting (1977: 3ff) points out, they were not prone to do so because until recently their profession was less concerned with people's daily lives than with their ways of thought. As current California salmon runs vary greatly from year to year, and in southern British Columbia ranged from 36% to 200% of normal in aboriginal times (Netting, 1977: 34), I infer their variability in the past.</page><page sequence="9">ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION AND THE PLAUSIBILITY OF RELIGION 335 any considerable period without busying himself with procuring food ... but the very diversity and multifariousness of the supply, and of his quest for it, while robbing him of leisure and concentration, gave him also comparative security against want (quoted in Heizer &amp; Elsasser, 1980: 112). Clearly the taboo on sex before hunting, along with menstrual confinement of women, the use of abortion and herbs for birth controL and occasional infanticide all served to keep human population within reasonable limits (Heizer &amp; Elsasser, 1980: 26). Such measures would not have been necessary were California as rich an environment as is frequently supposed. Unfortunately, anthropologists usually do not take the variability of California's climate into account in their estimates of the Indians' economic resources (e.g., Bauxhoff, 1978; Heizer &amp; Elsasser, 1980: 83-113). In particular, they have failed to guage the effect of microclimatic variability on differing ownership systems. To take an example: Heizer and Elsasser (1980: 95-8) estimate that in a good-bearing year a family of five could gather 33,600 pounds of acorns (producing 25,000 pounds of edible meal, before rodent damage and spoilage) over a two week period. However, they fail to note that good years are rare, and moreover choose an oak species, the valley oak, that bears more heavily than most - more than twice the amount borne by the major species in the Miwok's rpnge. A more realis figure for the Miwok (allowing for different oaks, bad harvests, spoilage and all) would average barely a seventh of that," which paints a considerably poorer picture of native life. They also neglect private property systems such as the Miwok's that restricted access to bearing trees. Though the total food production of a Miwok vllage may have been enough to feed everyone, not every family's oaks produced in a given year, and this variation was unpredictable. I believe that the differential variability of resources in north-central California, when combined with a rigid system of private ownership as found among the Miwok, let some people go lacking while others did not. People did not generally suffer, but when they did, they did not generally suffer together. RELIGIOUS CONSEQUENCES To understand the result of this situation we need only to enter the mental framework of the Miwok and to see the universe from their point of view. They knew nothing of our science, lacked our emphasis on natural causality, and in particular could not explain why one oak would bear in a given year and in another not.12 Indeed, our scientists cannot explain the why of this, but only the how, and this only after the fact. It would have been one thing if all families had suffered, but they did not. In a normal year only a few did, just as only some were struck by disease, while others had plenty to eat and were healthy. Their reasoning was sensible: mysterious effects must have 11. Oaks species common in the Coast Miwok area produce between 1/3 and 2/3 the poundage of valley oaks, with only 30-50% of the finished meal. I have taken the higher figure, allowed 30% storage loss, and figured one good year out of three, allowing for some production in the off years. Of course not all oaks would fail in a given year, but one could expect two-thirds of them to fall short, producing the same average. 12. I do not imply that our science always knows best. The Miwok applied moldy acorn mush to wounds several centuries before our scientists discovered penicillin.</page><page sequence="10">336 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION mystical causes. If one family is fat while another is hungry or ill, there must be a sorcerer at work. As already indicated, sorcery fears were rife among the Miwok and their neighbors. Sorcerers never came from one's own kin-group (in pre-contact times), but from the kin of one's enemies. Sorcery was always believed to be directed outward: toward the next lineage, the neighboring village, toward anyone whose good fortune was envied. If one year a family was rich and healthy, and the next it was poor and ill, this sorcery explained the situation to the natives in terms they could readily understand. Miwok cosmology was thus a product and a reflection of a particular kind of family and property structure in a particular environment. On the one hand, the relatively rich environment made a lack of cooperation between kin-groups possible. Had the environment been less rich, the innate selfishness of the system could never have prevailed. On the other hand, the environment's scattered failures presented a practical problem that demanded comprehension. The cosmology that resulted both explained environmental failures and expressed the underlying social hostilities in a particularly direct way. Fortunately for the stability of society, resource failure was not a yearly occurrence. Many years yielded enough for all, a few yielded enough for none, and the rest - perhaps a third to a half - made families suffer differentially. The environment was never stable enough for sorcery fears to disappear. And disease, the other major sign of the sorcerer's work, could always strike. It is here that the Kuksu cult was useful. As noted, there were two main foci of cult activities in the native mind: the renewal of the group and the renewal of the world. Here my argument is speculative, but it seems logical that these foci became important at different points in the socio-environmental cycle. In those years when resources were sufficient for all, it is likely that sorcery fears were at a minimum, and cult activities were a communal celebration of benefits received. People gathered together willingly, for tensions were less, though the possibility of magcally-induced illness kept all on guard. When the harvest was less widespread, sorcery attributions were at their peak, and the cult emphasized the peacefulness one should display to the neighbor, in contrast to the actual state of affairs. Kuksu provided a counter- weight to the forces of dissolution. But when everyone's resources failed, it seems to me unlikely that sorcery would be blamed. Rather the cult would be turned to the task of world-renewal, setting the entire cosmos back on course. Once again people would pull together, to set their common world right. Clearly if all were suffering, an act of the spirits, not of any one family, was the source of the problem. In many years, however, a variable environment combined with strict property rights and no system of resource redistribution makes sorcery plausible as an explanation of misfortune. IMPLICATIONS This picture is unfortunately speculative. At 150 years remove it is impossible to make my account more than a plausible reconstruction of a religio/socio/environmental</page><page sequence="11">ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION AND THE PLAUSIBILITY OF RELIGION 337 system now deceased.13 Once put forward, however, this model obliges us to consider certain notions that may prove useful in our contemporary work. First, it encourages us to widen our view of religion, seeing it affected not only by social processes (with which we are quite familiar) but also by the natural environment within which its adherents live. To the extent that we see worldviews in general as reflecting only social structure (e.g., Douglas, 1970, 1982), we are victims of our own environmental circumstances. Our relations with the natural world are much more socially mediated than are those of non-urban peoples, though theirs are in no sense "pure." We would do well to treat social and natural environments as differently combined in different societies. Both are important constitutents of all people's experiences, and any religion that contradicts such experiences will not be plausible. Second, this model encourages us to see religions from the point of view of their adherents, without giving up our analytic intentions. Too often social scientists are given the false altematives of either seeing things with native eyes or with those of our profession (Spickard, 1984). But we are not forced to choose. A thorough undersanding of their world, alongside an understanding of their world through their eyes, illumines not only their relations with the world but their vision of it. When we can see that vision's sense - in their terms as well as ours - we are not limited to any one cultural view. That, I think, is the strength of an analysis based on plausibility. Many ecological studies focus on the functionality of particular beliefs and practices within a given environment (e.g., Harris, 1974; Netting, 1977). Most of these only show how native views make sense to us. They fail to show how the natives make sense of their situation, and the intelligence with which they do so. We can gain from these sudies an awareness that religions are ways of interacting with the everyday world, but we must still treat our subjects as sensitive and discerning actors, who believe things not only because they are "functional" but also because they "make sense." I find the Coast Miwok case interesting because of this balance. Not only are many of their beliefs functional given their environment, but their whole religious complex makes sense in their socio-environmental situation. We can imagne ourselves knowing what they know, affirming what they affirm, acting as they act. We do not have to consider them benighted souls in order to affirm our wider view. 13. If the cult focus changed with the yearly variations in rainfall and resources, as I have proposed, we might see reports of increased cult activity for years such as 1815 and 1884, when dust clouds from the Indonesian volcanoes Tambora and Karakatoa caused decreased plant growth over much of the world. I have found missionary documents from the Round Valley reservation that mention increased Bole-Maru cult activities in the early 1880's, but I cannot tell whether this outbreak was environmentally caused, as opposed to being a result of anti-white feeling. In any event, records of Indian cult activities are sparse, and silence on the matter would not be a disproof of my hypothesis.</page><page sequence="12">338 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION REFERENCES Aginsky, Burt W. and Ethel G.
