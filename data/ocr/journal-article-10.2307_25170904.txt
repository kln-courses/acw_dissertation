<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVOLUTION: TELEOLOGY OR CHANCE? F. J. K. SOONTI?NS SUMMARY. Revaluation of the problem of natural teleology seems an important precondition for elucidating our environmental crisis and for formulating an 'ecological ethics', because it calls for a recognition of an intrinsic value in nature and organisms. Therefore, it is necessary to show that the concept of natural teleology is not in contradiction with scientific theories, in particular not with the theory of evolution. In this paper I shall argue that there is a fundamental misunderstanding about the concepts of teleology and chance in modern thinking. This as a result of a radical transformation of the Aristotelian concept of teleology by Christian theologians during the Middle Ages. This confusion resulted in the rejection of teleology from evolution and in an exaggeration of the role of chance. However, not a solution for the problem of teleology is given here, but only an attempt to prove that neither the fossil record, nor the role of chance in evolution can give adequate arguments for the negation of teleology in evolution. That is not to say that, therefore there exists teleology in evolution, but the problem of teleology in nature cannot, be solved by the scientific theory of evolution, but only be elucidated by philosophical analysis. At the end of the paper it is argued that teleology must be rather presupposed in evolution. Key words: evolution, teleology, chance, purpose, anthropomorphism. 1. INTRODUCTION Throughout the entire history of western thinking - from the Greeks untill now - there exists a confrontation between two options attempting to explain the harmonic order of nature, which are often supposed to exclude each other: (1) On the one hand, the so-called 'teleological' explanation, formulated first by Plato and more particularly by Aristotle, who accepted final causes 'for the sake of which' natural events happen, as a principle for explaining the harmony of nature and the orderly changes in it. For Aristotle this teleological principle is a fundamental pre-condition to all scientific in vestigation of the causes in nature (Aristotle, Physics). Later, Kant also held this opinion, although he limited teleology to only an epistemological, heuristic principle, which he supposed to guide the scientific enterprise (Kant, 1790). (2) On the other hand, the so-called 'mechanistic' explanation, formu lated first by the atomists, as Democritos, who excluded all teleology from nature and appealed only to necessity ('ananke') and chance ('tyche') to explain natural order. This mechanistic approach of nature became very influential in western thinking after the 'scientific revolution' of the seven teenth century.

SOONTI?NS Since the Renaissance teleology and teleological explanation are con sidered with much scepticism. The so-called 'mechanization' of the world picture by the scientific revolution (see Dijksterhuis, 1950), was accompanied by a rejection of final causality, because this was considered as 'anthropo morphic', 'useless' and 'meaningless' in science. As Bacon said, "the inquisition of final causes is a barren thing and like a virgin consecrated to God produces nothing" (Bacon, 1974, 512). Not the 'why'-question regarding the essence and telos of the natural things, but only the question 'how' things were behaving - represented by mathematical functions between parameters and variables - could give a scientific explanation for the natural phenomena. However, the role of teleology in biology has always been a point of much discussion. Teleological language is easy to find in textbooks about physiology, anatomy, immunology and embryology but even in the most mechanistic branch of it, molecular biology, sometimes explicitly in terms as 'function', 'role' 'end', sometimes more covert in words as 'to', 'for' etc. It seems that teleological explanation is inevitable in biology. The attempts to give an explanation of teleology by reducing it to a form of mechanistic causality as originally proposed by the system-theorist Bertalanffy (1968) and the cyberneticist Wiener (1950) have been shown to be unsuccessful (see f.e. Jonas, 1979; Taylor, 1966). And also the attempts by philosophers of science, e.g. by Nagel (1963) and Hempel (1965), to translate teleological explanation into the DCN-model of physics and chemistry are considered as unsuccessful by leading philosophers of biology (see Ruse, 1973, Ayala, 1970, Hull, 1974, Mayr, 1972). Now, they try to justify teleological explanation as scientific by appealing to the theory of evolution. The hope is that, by placing teleology in the context of evolutionary theory, it can be explained in a natural way. The problem of teleological explanation does not regard us here however (see for that Soontiens, 1988, 1990). Here, I only wish to make clear that the recognition of the fundamental role of chance and opportunism in evolu tion, does not imply that teleology is absent in the evolutionary process. This could be important because it has been argued that the acceptance of a natural teleology is a precondition for a so-called ecological ethics (see Soontiens, 1990b). 2.) EVOLUTION, NECESSITY, PURPOSE AND CHANCE For many biologists, Darwin's theory of evolution (1859) meant the crown on the mechanistic program in explaining (living) nature, because it appeals only to natural principles and chance instead of to final causes or 'super natural' purposes. The modern theory of evolution, as formulated by the 'founding fathers' as Dobzhansky, Huxley, Simpson, Mayr, Stebbins, rejects teleology in evolution, because the fossil-record does not show any evidence that</page><page sequence="3">EVOLUTION: TELEOLOGY OR CHANCE? 135 evolution would follow a straight path to a certain goal. Instead, oppor tunism and randomness can be observed in the evolutionary lines, which continuously show adaptive radiation. As Simpson said, evolution does not follow a "steady progression towards a discernible goal" (Simpson, 1949, 70), and according Huxley evolution does not show a "persistence towards a predetermined goal" (Huxley, 1974, 497), therefore "evolution is devoid of purpose" (Stebbins, 1982, 4). The problem of teleology in evolution is identified with the question of the validity of orthogenesis, which can be defined as the "inherent tendency for evolution to continue in a given direction [...] towards a discernible goal" (Simpson, 1949, 32). According to that theory evolution is predetermined, which contradicts "the fundamental unpredictability and creativity for novelties of evolution" (Dobzhansky, 1968, 165). So teleology is rejected because it is supposed to imply preformism and predictability. 2) Also teleology is rejected because the role of chance in evolution is supposed to be in contrast with teleology. 'Chance' is said to be involved in mutation, in recombination, in genetic flow, in the pairing of chromosomes and in the mating of gametes and organisms, and in the 'founder effect'. This role of chance at several levels compelled Monod to say that "chance alone is at the source of every evolutionary innovation" (Monod, 1970, 110). However, several scientists state - in reaction to Monod - that he has over-estimated the role of chance. According to them, teleology in evolution can be explained by necessary, system-theoretical laws (Riedl, 1975; Wuketits, 1980) and/or thermodynamical laws (Schoffeniels, 1976, Brooks and Wiley, 1986; Wicken, 1987). So, teleology is considered as in contrast with chance as with necessity. Analyzing the use of the term 'chance' shows, however, a chaotic spectrum of meanings. Chance can mean: 'random', 'accidental', 'capricious', 'dis ordered', 'undirected', 'probable', 'stochastic', 'undirected', 'unprobable', 'not-planned', 'not-meant', 'uncertain', 'undetermined', 'unpredictable'. Careful analysis of the context of these terms and meanings reveals that they are used in contrast to one of two fundamentally different domains: (1) 'chance' as contrary to intention, to purposiveness (which is the original aristotelian meaning of chance), and (2) 'chance' as contrary to lawfulness, to necessity (which is in fact the traditional problem of'contingency'). Under the cover of the different terms, these meanings are constantly confused with each other. The reason for this confusion - of 'chance' as 'not-intended' and 'chance' as 'not-necessary' - is that these meanings all seem to imply 'unpredictability': in the former case one does not know the reasons why something has been done, in the latter, one does not know the causes why something has happened. So, under the cover of the concept of 'chance' (referred to by a multitude of different terms) as unpredictability, two fundamentally different philo sophical problems are treated as if they were the same: viz. the problem of 'chance' (as not-intended) with the problem of 'contingency' (as non</page><page sequence="4">136 F. J. K. SOONTI?NS necessity). The confusion of both problems was already present in the scholastic attempts to reconcile a Divine creation with the contingency of nature and the freedom of man: whatever might have been created by God was meant in that way by Him and so it is also necessary that things are as they are. (see for discussion Soontiens, 1988). Both meanings are not identical, however: that which is not intended (and in that sense 'accidental') can be necessary (and so in that sense 'not accidental'), as can easily be seen from the example of tossing a coin. Again, that which is not-necessary (and in that sense 'accidental') can be intended (and so in that sense 'not-accidental'), as can be experienced in human free choice. But under the cover of the term 'chance' - with all these implicit meanings, which seldom are exactly described or defined - as 'unpredictability', 'chance' is regarded as excluding the possibility of teleology in evolution, because teleology is regarded as including 'predictability': evolution cannot be predicted, so it is accidental and therefore evolution excludes teleology. 3. TELEOLOGY AS INTENTIONALITY The arguments rejecting teleology in evolution are not justified, however. (1) in the first place the identification of teleology with orthogenesis is not correct. The rejection of orthogenesis does not imply a rejection of teleology. Teleology is not identical with a straightforward movement to a prescribed goal. (a) A straightforward progression towards a goal is not required for teleology. That is clearly illustrated by the games we play: football-players are criss-crossing all over the field, but evidently there is a goal (even two!). Searching behavior too, often shows a 'trial and error' character, while evidently one is looking for something. (b) The existence of a prescribed goal is also not required for teleology. The search for truth by science, the striving towards the Good in our ethical behavior or the lure of beauty in the creative work of an artist, are examples of the search for something, while nothing like a predetermined goals exists. An artist often discovers what he really wants in the course of his creative activity he was striving for. Teleology does not even require that the goal (for example winning the game) is really reached or realized. So, the random, capricious, opportunistic movements of the evolutionary lines, as shown by the fossils, do not necessarily imply the absence of a goal. (2) In the second place, chance does not exclude the presence of teleology. Neither in its meaning of'not-intended', nor in its meaning of'not-necessary' (contingence), 'chance' does exclude teleology, as Aristotle already knew. When I go to the market to buy a bread (teleological), I can accidently (not-intended) meet you, who went to market to buy wine (also teleological). Next, when I make a free (not-necessary) choice, I behave myself teleological. Furthermore, games are good examples of teleological behavior with a</page><page sequence="5">EVOLUTION: TELEOLOGY OR CHANCE? 137 fundamental role for chance as 'not-intended'. And the artist too knows how an 'accidental' mistake can sometimes reveal his purpose. In short, teleology does neither imply the straightforward progress to a predetermined goal, nor the exclusion of chance. The reason why teleology is associated with orthogenesis, preformism and predictability seems to be, that teleology is considered according the model of (and/or as the result of) intentionally of a planning and purposive agent, but that identification could only be justified in a special form of teleology based on the model of purposed design' (external teleology). Dobzhansky, for instance, argued that evolution is not teleological because "it has no foresight" (Dobzhanskly, 1968). Stebbins stated that evolution is not teleological because it "is devoid of purpose" (Stebbins, 1982). Both authors - an many others - refer to the paradigmatic model of 'human consciousness'. Now, one of the strongest reasons why teleology has become identified or strongly associated with intentionality, is to be found in positions that were elaborated as a result of the scholastic disputes about the creation of the world by an intelligent Creator. This position, which was often seen as the Medieval version of Aristotle's position, reveals itself to be the exact reversal of the position of the Greek philosopher. Aristotle accentuated in the first place an 'internal teleology', in which final causes are active in nature itself: things strive to the actualization of their own form feidos'), like the oak-nut is striving to be an oak. For him, teleology in nature is a pre-condition to human teleology as manifested in art and technique ('techne'). It is only because there is teleology in nature that man can make his artifacts and fulfil nature in some way. 'Techne' imitates ('mimesis') the natural process: If the ship-building art were in the wood it would produce the same result by nature. If therefore, purpose is present in art, it is present also in nature. The best illustration is a doctor doctoring himself: nature is like that. It is plain that nature is a cause, a cause that operates for a purpose... It is absurd to suppose that purpose is not present, because we do not observe the agent deliberating. (Aristotle, Physica, II, 199b, 20). For Aristotle, this mimesis is alto the reason for using the analogon of techne for the understanding of nature. An analysis of the causes which are responsible for the existence of an artifact, provides a key for explaining natural processes. Under the influence of Christian theology, this Aristotelian concept of 'internal teleology' was radically transformed. Nature came to be viewed as the result of 'external teleology': all natural order and all natural processes were the outcome of God's plan and purpose. While for Aristotle natural teleology was the pre-condition to (human) teleology of a subject, for the Middle Ages the teleolology of a (divine) Subject became the precondition to natural teleology. Although Thomas wished to make a clear distinction between the problem of natural teleology and creative teleology, we can observe in his texts a strong suggestion that all final causes are a result of 'agens ab intellectu':</page><page sequence="6">138 F. J. K. SOONTI?NS We observed that natural things which lack knowledge work towards an end [...] [TJhings which do not have knowledge do not tend to an end, except under the direction of some one who known and understands [...] There is therefore, an intelligent personal being by whom everything in nature is ordered to its end. (Thomas van Aquino, Summa Theologica, Q.2, Art. 3). Anyhow, it is true that he was understood in that way by thinkers of later times: intentionality became the presupposition for all teleology. This conversion showed itself to be of fundamental importance for the history of the concept of teleology: criticism of the concept almost always starts from the supposition that intentionality is the prerequisite for teleology. Critics as John Buridan, Gallilei, Bacon, Descartes, Spinoza, Hobbes, Locke and others, all reject teleology because they all suppose that it implies 'purposes of God' and 'anthropomorphism'. Many attacks on teleology are attacks on its anthropomorphic character, because of the implicit conviction that intentionality is the precondition to teleology. But strictly speaking, only teleology according to the model of 'external teleology' can be said to be 'anthropomorphic', in the sense of ascribing specific human properties to nature. Besides, even human teleology does not always imply the consciousness of a purpose. We are not always conscious of the goal we are trying to reach in our teleological activities of speaking, creating, searching. Thus, to ascribe teleology to nature does not necessarily imply the existence of an intention in nature. Teleology may be considered as an anthropomorphic concept, not because it would presuppose a mind in nature, but because it attempts to explain nature by referring to an aspect of human experience. One of the most remarkable but hardly noticed paradoxes of the history of science since modern times, has been in fact the constant increase of anthropomorphic terms such as 'force', 'affinity', 'selection', 'information', 'game', 'translation', 'learning', 'recognizing' etc. These concepts are an thropomorphic, not because they would ascribe special human properties to non-human things, but because they all need a reference to human experience to give them any meaning at all. Such anthropomorphism seems unavoidable also in science. In this sense too, teleology may be considered as an anthropomorphic concept, because it attempts to explain some aspects of nature by referring to an essential element of human experience (see also Soontiens, 1991). Thus, the whole tangled, confused and confusing discussion about chance and teleology in evolution is the result of a fundamental misunderstanding of what 'teleology' is, ever since Christian theology has tried to reconcile Greek philosophical notions with the biblical Revelation. Teleology was progressively identified with only one form of it, viz. 'external teleology'. Also the modern discussion about teleology in evolution is in fact a discussion about the 'argument of design', about theology not about teleology. This comes as no surprise if one knows that the theories of evolution in 18th and 19th century were formulated when 'natural theology' was very</page><page sequence="7">EVOLUTION: TELEOLOGY OR CHANCE? 139 influential in Britain. This 'natural theology' tried to prevent the atheistic consequences of Newtonianism, showing that the Newtonian world-order could only be as it is, if one supposed the existence of a divine Engineer. Especially biological adaptations formed a strong argument in favour of the existence of God: the 'argument of design'. In particular, Darwin was strongly influenced by the assumption of natural theology that natural teleology presupposes a divine 'Purposer'. It is true that Darwin, the most important hero of biology, had studied theology in Cambridge and earned a degree! In particular the popular book 'Natural Theology' (1809) written by Paley - one of the great natural theologians of the 19th century - had been studied by Darwin very carefully: "I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's... I could almost formally have said it by heart," he wrote to Sir John Lubbock (in: Darwin, F. (ed.), 1887). Darwin attempted to give a natural instead of a super-natural explanation for the phenomena of biological adaptation. Darwin himself was however very ambiguous about the problem of teleology, as can be read in his autobiography and letters. On the 12th July 1870 he wrote to his American friend Asa Gray: "I cannot look at the universe as the result of blind chance, yet I can see no evidence of beneficent design or indeed of design of any kind in the details" (in: F. Darwin, 1903, 321). So, Darwin identified the problem of natural teleology with natural theology, with the argument of design, and most modern evolutionists have followed Darwin's lead in this misconception! But in their criticism of the 'argument of design', the evolutionists were trapped in the nets of the very theological ideas which they were trying to dispel. By unmasking the suggestion of (Divine) intentionality, every form of teleology is erroneously eliminated from evolution and nature. Most of the criticism of teleology turns out to be a criticism of the 'argument of design', so of theology rather than teleology. Also the popular book of Richard Dawkins, 'The Blind Watchmaker' (1985) is in fact an extensive criticism not of natural teleology as such but of the 'argument of design'.1 4. TELEOLOGY AS A PRECONDITION FOR EVOLUTION? In summary, neither the random behavior of fossil-lines, nor the rejection of orthogenesis, nor the role of chance, necessarily imply the absence of teleology in evolution. In fact, there are good reasons to believe that teleology is a precondition for evolution. (1) The principle of natural selection as based on the 'struggle for life', presupposes the teleological character of needy organisms striving for food, sex etc. Their striving-character is the cause of their involvement in the struggle for life. Furthermore, the concept of 'natural selection' is implicitly teleological, because it has only a meaning within a teleological context. It can only be undertstood in analogy with our teleological activity of selec</page><page sequence="8">140 F. J. K. SOONTI?NS tion: giving preference to something in the perspective of some goal. Besides, the very concept of evolution itself implies the recognition of a direction, thus ipso facto of a 'telos'. (2) It is just the theory of evolution that has stressed the intimate relationship between nature and man. Man is a natural product of a natural evolutionary process: realisation of natural possibilities. Therefore the theory of evolution - rather than being the crown of mechanicism - has implicitly undermined the a-teleological, mechanistic conception of nature, because it presupposes a continuity between (teleological) man and nature. We all agree that man is a teleological being, but how can there be teleology in man, when he is only the accidental product of an a-teleological nature? If nature and evolution are a-teleological, than we are either obliged to conclude that human teleology stems from a non- (extra-, super-) natural source, or we are obliged to conclude that human teleology is only an illusion. That is the fundamental choice we have to make. The analysis given in this article suggests however, that the rejection of natural teleology by the theory of evolution is not justified. So, to do justice to teleological nature of man, it seems more preferable to formulate a philosophy of nature in which natural teleology gets a fair treatment. Furthermore, a teleological view of nature seems a precondition for a so called ecological ethics, because it calls for a recognition of an intrisic value in nature and organisms, (see Jonas (1979), Soontiens, 1990). NOTES 1 Also the attempts of vitalism, mechanicism, systemtheory and cybernetics to justify or to criticise teleology, are all determined by this same misunderstanding, (see Soontiens, 1988).
