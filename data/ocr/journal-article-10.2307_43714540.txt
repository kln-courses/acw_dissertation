Here are two more additions to the endless bibliography on the Resurrection: one a primitiae, the other a nunc dimittis. Dr. Alsup's is a dissertation, in the Ã©tat sauvage of the genre. Its text makes for some heavy going and was, one might sus- pect, more intelligible to a German reader than it is to an English one. The clarity of the text is in inverse ratio to the number of the footnotes. The author is almost incapable of making a straightforward statement without trundling the creaky ap- paratus of footnotes that meet every anticipated objection, anticipate every imag- ined question, and quietly lay to rest every doubt about his erudition. Little, if any, consideration is given the English reader even when translations of the cited works are readily available and not unknown to the author (see, e.g., n. 617, p. 216). Nevertheless, grammatical solecisms, syntactical nodosities and typographical idiosyncrasies notwithstanding, A.'s dissertation makes a useful contribution to the ever unresolved question of the resurrection narratives in the NT. It is, by the very nature of the case, an analytic study; and the analytic method does not readily lend itself to effortless expository writing. So, to give a summary of the method and argument of the work is a necessity and not just a makeweight for the review. A. undertakes a task that, on his showing, has not been done, or at least not as thoroughly done, before. The task is "a history-of-tradition analysis of the post- resurrection appearance stories of the gospel tradition" (p. 19). Diligently avoiding entanglement in, though not description and documentation of, the multiplicity of problems, the author concentrates on the Easter appearance stories in the Gospels and sets out to determine their form and structure in order to discover "their pre- redactional origin and intention as Gattung. " The first relevant problem to be tackled within this narrowly (to this reviewer, much too narrowly) defined field of inquiry is that of the origin of the appearance stories. Inevitably, the question of their relation to the primitive kerygma has to be raised; and, just as inevitably, the weighty influence of Dibelius on the solution</page><page sequence="2">112 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 40,1978 has to be countered. That the appearance stories were "late missionary sermon paradigms or illustrations of the kerygma" is a hypothesis that has to be rejected. Not only are there too many gaps in the contacts between these stories and the kerygma, but the very nature of the stories postulates a different Sitz im Leben. With the exception of Matt 28:9, 10 and John 20:14-18, the former redactionally constructed out of an empty tomb account and the latter heavily dependent on it, the Gospel appearance stories "do not owe their origin in any sense to the depen- dence upon other traditional strata. They build an independent stream of tradition next to those of the kerygma and tomb traditions" (p. 268). This argument leads to the central third chapter, which bears the title of the dissertation itself. Here the author deals with the "Group Appearance' ' (Matt 28:16-20; Luke 24:36-49; John 20:19-23, 24-29), the Emmaus Story (Luke 24:13-33, 35), the Galilean Appearance (John 21:1-14), and the Mary Magdalene Appearance (John 20:14-18). The most challenging task in these stories is, naturally enough, the separation of the traditional elements in them from the subsequent redactional work of the evangelists. The group appearances exhibit "basic similarities of motif' * (p. 190); so too do the other three appearance stories, whose form closely parallels that of the group appearances. There are, however, two notable exceptions to this close parallel: the commission motif in John 21 and the meal motif in Luke 24. The author shows that it is precisely at these two points that "we have the most con- centrated redactional activity" (p. 212). (In order to follow A. 's analysis better, a text synopsis is provided on a foldout insert in the inside back cover.) C. H. Dodd and others had, of course, already subjected the stories to a form analysis. What A. adds to that is to concentrate more on the structure of the stories and on their motif elements "as leading not just to an outline but rather to a form more closely identifiable with a Gattung . " For, the author concludes, "they were stories and not story-constructs and as such they participated in a particular story Gattung " (p. 269). Having arrived at this conclusion, A. proceeds to examine the origins of the Gattung and to see what can be said about its Sitz im Leben. Though formal parallels do exist in the Hellenistic backgrounds to the gospel appearance stories, they offer "little help in making precise the actual origins" of the Gattung (p. 270). The OT "anthropomorphic theophany stories," however, are a different matter. They come "exceedingly close" (p. 270) to the gospel stories in both form and subject matter. They provided the NT authors with the elements to express "an experience or occurrence of revelation" (p. 273). The question of the experience behind the confessional expressions, the ques- tion, that is, of the historicity of the accounts, which the author had set aside at the start of his work, is raised at the very end. The concluding words of the dissertation assert, "It would seem that the farthest point in the origins of the tradition to which we may reach back is to the Gattung itself which declared that the risen Lord en- countered and re-established fellowship with his own and sent them out in his ser- vice. Affirming historicity of this kind, which is in keeping with the statement- intention of the Gattung itself, becomes both an exegetical conclusion and a state- ment of faith." This, of course, begs the question altogether. Faith, one might ask, in what? Can the affirmation of "historicity" of any kind become a statement of faith any more than the exegetical conclusion can become its underpinning? The ills that beset A.'s work are endemic to the genre: the need to show that</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS AND SHORT NOTICES 1 1 3 previous attempts failed or fell short of success; the excessive narrowing of the field of inquiry; and the urgency to reach a conclusion broader than the premises allow. The statistical method employed here, moreover, is notoriously deceptive when the sample excludes so much and includes so little. Nevertheless, there is a great deal of material that can be useful for future research into the resurrection narratives. That usefulness will be greatly enhanced if the author, having now discharged the obliga- tions of this initiation rite, would use the rich material gathered here for some articles on the principal concerns of his dissertation. To go from this work to Professor Perrin's is to move from the crabbed con- fines of the narrowly academic to the freer realms of haute vulgarisation. P., sure of his competence and aware of his real or imagined limitations, has left us a con- cise exposition of the aims and purposes of Mark, Matthew and Luke through their handling of the resurrection event. Those acquainted with P. 's sizable and sub- stantial contribution to the field of synoptic studies will find here little that is really new. But the author's purpose was much more modest than that. He set out to show, in clear workmanlike prose, how the resurrection narratives are "expressions of a distinctive theological viewpoint* ' (pp. 4, 6). What concerns him here is "more important than the question of 'what actually happened' in terms of appearance stories and empty tomb traditions' ' (p. 84). That concern provided him with an opportunity (alas! the last) to define his own faith, to reaffirm his stand on synoptic issues, and to provide his own views of the synoptic problems. Such, of course, is the privilege and the reward of acknowledged scholarly competence. Though both works under review touch on the same points, A. 's is a work of constraint and P. 's is a labor of love. " Confiteor : laudani illa sed ista legunt. " Stanley B. Marrow, Weston School of Theology, Cambridge , MA 02138</page></plain_text>
