The controversy concerning the theoretical basis for judicial review is a matter of importance that extends beyond the particular concerns of public lawyers. Embracing the fundamental relationship between the legislature and the judiciary and their respective constitutional roles, it brings into sharp focus issues which have a bearing on our wider understanding of the nature of law and its practice. The way the controversy has developed provides a particularly striking opportunity to consider the benefits of relating academic and practitioner perspectives, and to consider the value of theoretical insights for our understanding of the practice of law. The course this particular controversy has taken also raises general questions about the nature of academic debate, and the the way that academic and practitioner alike are inclined to represent the law. Accordingly, a wide variety of readers should welcome this collection of essays on the foundations of judicial review. 1 The two models of judicial review Two models have been proposed for the basis of judicial review. A certain amount of refinement has occurred to each, but it is helpful to start with the extreme versions so as to clarify matters before undertaking the more difficult task of exposing the real nature of the dispute that now remains.2 The ultra vires model treats the basis for judicial review as the courts ensuring that a power granted by the sovereign Parliament is not exercised beyond the limits * Faculty of Law, University of Southampton. I am grateful to the AHRB for an award to support a research project of which this essay forms a part, and to Liz Fisher for helpful discussions of judicial review. 1 Unattributed references below are to this collection. 2 It is not altogether clear that either model in its extreme form has gained unalloyed support. The extreme form of the ultra vires model is associated with Sir William Wade (Mark Elliott, 84). The extreme form of the common law model is thought to have surfaced in what Lord Irvine has described as some 'extra-judicial romanticism' of Lord Woolf and Sir John Laws (referred to at 45, 126-127, 394). Reasons why it is difficult to find a pure expression of either model in its extreme form include the varied range of contexts in which judicial review is sought, the confusing range of uses to which the term ultra vires has been put (on which see David Feldman, ch 11), and the speculative nature of some of the discussion. Nevertheless, even if the two models in their extreme forms represent hypothetical theoretical positions, they have their value in marking out the nature of the gap which has been narrowed in subsequent theoretical positions actually adopted. 500 0 The Modem Law Review Limited 2001 (MLR 64:3, May).

The principles of judicial review are, accordingly, just those which mark out the limits found in the explicit or implicit intention of Parliament in granting the power. The common law model (again in its extreme form) treats the principles of judicial review as created by the common law, judicially constructed to ensure the proper exercise of power. As such they could even be used to strike down a power explicitly granted by Parliament to be exercised in breach of these principles. It is apparent that the contested ground between these two models in their extreme forms covers the sovereignty of Parliament and judicial creativity. The modified ultra vires model still maintains the role of the courts as subordinate to the sovereign Parliament but now acknowledges a creative judicial role in working out the detailed principles of judicial review. These roles of Parliament and the courts are kept in harmony by positing an implied legislative intent that all statutory powers should be exercised in accordance with the principles of judicial review which Parliament has authorised the courts to apply. The modified common law model openly acknowledges the sovereignty of Parliament by admitting that the principles of judicial review could not be effective against a clear statutory statement that they should not prevail, but still maintains an independent common law source for the principles, which are regarded as having come into being irrespective of Parliamentary intention. What is apparent now is the common ground between the two models. Although impartial contributors to the debate find it less easy to see what the remaining differences are, in the eyes of the leading proponents of the two models the distinction is still very real. In considering what remains of this distinction I shall concentrate on the features that make the two models what they are. Such an exercise should help us to unravel the unresolved issues at the heart of judicial review. The 'undistributed' or 'excluded middle' One issue affecting the core features of the two models surfaces at various stages in the debate, and is alluded to by both Paul Craig and Christopher Forsyth as still very much a part of what divides the two approaches. Craig, in his assessment of the remaining difference between the two models, states that: It should be remembered that the central kernel of the argument [for the ultra vires model] is that where Parliament does not prohibit it must be taken to authorise expressly or impliedly. It is for this reason that legislative intent must be found in order to legitimate the imposition of any constraints on the way in which power is exercised. .... The common law model holds that the principles of judicial review are developed by the courts. ... If the omnipotent Parliament does not like these controls then it is open to it to make this explicitly clear. ... There is therefore nothing in the common law model which involves a strong challenge to sovereignty. (pp 378, 382-383) The contrasting perspective is provided by Forsyth: The difference between [the two models] is simply over the articulation of what is plainly an artificial construct: the intention of Parliament. Should Parliament be presumed to have authorised the application by the judges of the principles of good administration or should that authorisation come from the common law? ... The concepts of ultra vires and intra vires are mutually exclusive: a decision-maker either acts within or outside his or her powers, there is no middle ground. ... If, say, a decision-maker in denying a hearing in certain circumstances, acts within the powers granted by Parliament the common law cannot impose ? The Modem Law Review Limited 2001 501</page><page sequence="3">The Modern Law Review [Vol. 64 a duty of fairness upon that decision-maker without challenging parliament's power to allow him or her to make valid decisions without a hearing. Otherwise you have the position where every requirement for validity laid down expressly or implied by Parliament is satisfied yet the common law is imposing an additional requirement for validity. That is a challenge to parliamentary supremacy. (pp 396, 402) The issue arising in these extracts is whether the intention of Parliament covers the conditions under which the power that it has granted is to be exercised, or whether it leaves a gap for the courts to impose conditions. This is the issue of the so called undistributed or excluded middle. The logical law of the excluded middle asserts that something must either be or not be the case (p V - p). There is no room for a situation in the middle of these two alternatives. Forsyth calls upon the notion (though not the terminology) of an excluded middle in the following way: The analytical difficulty is this: what an all powerful Parliament does not prohibit, it must authorise either expressly or impliedly. Likewise if Parliament grants a power to a minister, that minister either acts within those powers or outside those powers. There is no grey area between authorisation and prohibition or between empowerment and the denial of power. (pp 39-40) Sir John Laws, on the other hand, argues that there can indeed be a case in between 'Parliament authorises' and 'Parliament prohibits': Forsyth's argument is vitiated by an implicit mistake: the mistake of assuming that because Parliament can authorise or prohibit anything, all authorities and prohibitions must come from Parliament. It is a non sequitur. It neglects what the logicians call the 'undistributed middle' - an obscure, but useful, academic expression, meaning that although X and Y may be opposites, like praise or blame, they do not cover the whole field; there might be Z, which involves neither. (p 78) The terminology is misplaced for the principle of the undistributed middle technically refers not to the middle that was excluded by p V p, but to the middle term in a syllogism.3 Nevertheless, the gist of Laws' argument is clear. He is denying that we have a case of an excluded middle. Sometimes it is the case that Parliament neither authorises nor prohibits. In denying that there exists on a particular occasion a case of the excluded middle, one is not necessarily denying the law of the excluded middle. One may simply be pointing out that the case of suggested alternatives does not fall under p V r p because the one alternative is not the negation of the other, and hence the law of the excluded middle is not relevant. This is certainly the position with the analogy that Laws draws with praise or blame. Blame is not formed by the negation of praise - from the fact that I do not praise you it does not mean that I blame you. So on this occasion we do not have a case of p V p to fall under the general law. The analogy used by Forsyth, pregnant or not pregnant, is a perfect illustration of the law of the excluded middle - we reach the one alternative by the negation of the other, and pV ~p holds. The crucial question is: what is the relationship between the alternatives of Parliament intending to attach a condition to a power it has granted, and Parliament not so intending? 3 For example, an argument to prove that all sharks are lawyers: All lawyers can bite; all sharks can bite; therefore, all sharks are lawyers. is flawed because the middle term, 'can bite', is undistributed (ie does not cover all of its instances). 502 C The Modem Law Review Limited 2001</page><page sequence="4">May 2001] The Theoretical Controversy Concerning Judicial Review Let us drop the technical terminology for the moment. It is perfectly intelligible to say of a person, for example, in relation to seeing a particular film at the cinema this evening, that he: (1) wants something to happen, or (2) wants something not to happen, or (3) has no wishes one way or the other This does not breach the law of the excluded middle, for (1) and (2) are separate propositions, each of which with its negation can satisfy the law of the excluded middle. Recognition of the distinct negations of (1) and (2) is a prerequisite to the recognition of (3), which is formed by the conjunction of the negations of (1) and (2). We can similarly provide a fuller presentation of the range of possibilities when Parliament grants a power, it is possible, for example, that: (la) P intends the power to be exercised reasonably, or (lb) P does not intend the power to be exercised reasonably. (2a) P intends that the power should be exercised unreasonably, or (2b) P does not intend that the power should be exercised unreasonably. and where both (ib) and (2b) hold (3) P has no intention whether the power should be exercised reasonably or not. The logical possibility of (3) becomes more plausible as a practical proposition when there has been no opportunity for consideration of what would be regarded as reasonable in relation to a specific exercise of the power. 'An all-powerful Parliament' Establishing that the law of the excluded middle does not make it logically impossible for Parliament to have no intention one way or the other, in relation to placing a condition on the exercise of a power it has granted, does not end the debate. There may be further reasons why Parliament should be regarded as having closed down all possibilities for the making of conditions other than those it has itself authorised. It is clear that for Forsyth, and the other supporters of the ultra vires model, the mainstay of their argument is the threat to parliamentary sovereignty that they believe would follow were their model abandoned in favour of the common law model.4 Forsyth, in his concluding contribution, regards it as the principal strength of the ultra vires model that it 'provides a firm constitutional foundation for judicial review' by treating the principles of judicial review as not a threat to parliamentary sovereignty but as impliedly authorised by Parliament (pp 408,404). Mark Elliott stands on the same ground, and has issued the ultimate challenge to the other side: so long as the common law accords a legislative supremacy to Parliament, it must be possible to reconcile the courts' public law jurisprudence with this constitutional principle. It is the interpretive methodology of ultra vires - and only this methodology - which is capable of securing this reconciliation. (p 109) 4 Mark Elliott is a particularly strong ally on this point - see his chs 5, 12 and 16, and 'The Demise of Parliamentary Sovereignty? The Implications for Justifying Judicial Review' (1999) 115 LQR 119. C The Modem Law Review Limited 2001 503</page><page sequence="5">The Modern Law Review [Vol. 64 This challenge assumes certain things about the nature of parliamentary sovereignty. Given that Parliament could be in a position of indifference as to the imposition of a condition on a power it had granted, the argument on the side of the ultra vires model has to place all its weight on an understanding of parliamentary sovereignty capable of excluding the logical possibility conveyed by proposition (3). In examining this further we will need both to consider the understanding of parliamentary sovereignty involved, and also to look in more detail at the practical factors which might bring about a case falling under proposition (3). In relation to parliamentary intention concerning a matter capable of being governed by law, it may be the case that Parliament has considered the matter and decided upon a neutral stance towards it.5 It may be that there has never been an occasion when Parliament has debated anything even remotely connected to the matter, or that the matter was not thought about at the time when a related subject was being debated. It may be that although there was general awareness of this particular matter, it was not brought to Parliament's attention or even implicitly taken into account when related legislation was passed. It may be that although the matter was raised in Parliament, the timetable of parliamentary business precluded relevant parliamentary intention being formed before the related legislation was enacted. It might even be the case that it was expedient not to resolve a parliamentary intention in relation to that particular matter before the vote was taken.6 Parliamentary sovereignty is a subject which can provide theorists with a number of stimulating issues to pursue.7 It may be as much an artificial construction as parliamentary intention,8 but even so may perform the function of covering, albeit figuratively, doctrines of practical importance. For our present interests we may fortunately reduce the subject matter of parliamentary sovereignty to a small number of practical concerns. It is one thing to invoke the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty in proclaiming (in the anthropomorphic language so often used in relation to Parliament) that Parliament cannot bind its successors, or in asserting that what Parliament enacts is supreme. It is, however, something else entirely to claim that an aspect of parliamentary sovereignty requires us to conclude that nobody can do anything without Parliament authorising it. This at the very least turns Parliament into an 5 The objection that Parliament by adopting a position of indifference is in fact adopting an intention in favour of the status quo, and so can never be truly indifferent, assumes that there exists a legal status quo. This is not always the case. It is not the case where the existing law is unclear and Parliament adopts a position of indifference as to its future course by declining the opportunity to enact a law to clarify it one way or the other (some would see the failure to codify the criminal law as a matter of parliamentary indifference). Nor is it the case where a change in the law is brought about with uncertain consequences and Parliament adopts a position of indifference as to which of those future consequences will prevail by declining the opportunity to deal with the matter in the legislation (whether in leaving it to the courts, or in leaving it to a statutory instrument to fill in the details). 6 The skill of the draftsman is occasionally called upon to word legislation that is ambiguous as to the determination of such a matter, so that every side within the apparent parliamentary consensus can be appeased. Louis Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action (Boston, MA: Little, Brown &amp; Co, 1965) 37-38, suggests that the inability to reach a detailed consensus within the legislature on controversial matters may be a good reason for delegating power to an administrative body. 7 For some recent examples, see Jeffrey Goldsworthy, The Sovereignty of Parliament: History and Philosophy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1999); Neil MacCormick, Questioning Sovereignty: Law, State, and Nation in the European Commonwealth (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999); N.

In fact, it requires of Parliament super-human capacities even in its anthropomorphic guise. It would mean that Parliament had the capacity to consider each past circumstance and each future eventuality, and to formulate an appropriate authorisation to deal with it. It would require the capacity to eradicate all of the cases that we have just catalogued as leading to a recognition of proposition (3). This needs more than an 'all-powerful Parliament'. We would need a legislative body displaying omniscience and capable of acting beyond temporal constraints.9 Recognising that Parliament has neither the time nor the capacity to exercise its sovereignty in such an officious manner does not lead us to deny other aspects of its sovereignty. The common law model adopts a practical view of parliamentary sovereignty which recognises that nobody can tell Parliament what to do, and that Parliament can always have the final say, but considers that until Parliament sees fit to proclaim otherwise the courts will get on with their business of formulating and applying the principles of judicial review. 'If the omnipotent Parliament does not like it, it can say so.' (To paraphrase slightly Craig's retort.) Admittedly, this view of parliamentary sovereignty acknowledges that the courts continue to go about their business on the sufferance of Parliament: that the sovereign Parliament if it wished could take away all the business of the courts, and hand it over to popular tribunals; and could undo all the past work of the courts by enacting a comprehensive code to replace all existing law. Still, this view does not recognise that the conduct of each element of the court's business is authorised by Parliament. It is rather like, in a more primitive context, trying to account for the continuing validity of the laws of Rex I after his death upon the succession of Rex II. Given that Rex II could have repealed all the laws of Rex I but has not done so, their continuing validity is on the sufferance of Rex II. However, it would be absurd to suggest that Rex II authorised the laws that Rex I made.10 It is part of the common ground between the modified ultra vires and common law models that the details of the principles of judicial review are created by the courts, so neither side is suggesting that in some way parliamentary sovereignty requires Parliament to authorise the material content of the principles of judicial review. Yet there remains a point of issue between the two models over the matter of who has authorised the principles of judicial review. Are they created under the authority of Parliament, or by the courts' own authority? What exactly are the practical implications of the view of parliamentary sovereignty required by the ultra vires model? Since it is not being suggested that Parliament authorises the material content of the principles of judicial review, how exactly does its purported authorisation of the principles bite in a practical way? An important qualification that has been suggested from the ultra vires side is that the issue of authorisation only arises in the context of the courts dealing with the conditions that are to be attached to a statutory power.11 This recognises that the courts on their own authority get on with the business of developing and applying the principles of judicial review for non-statutory bodies, but insists that any conditions attached to a power granted by Parliament must be authorised by Parliament itself at pain of threatening parliamentary sovereignty. 9 It is not sufficient to rely on the default intention enthusiastically adopted by John Austin in W. Rumble (ed), The Province of Jurisprudence Determined (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995) 35. This is either fiction, suggested by Austin's remark that rules made by judges are 'established by the sovereign legislature'; or another instance of the error of equating the absence of a prohibition with a positive authorisation, suggested by his talking of an authority imparted 'by way of acquiescence'. 10 See H.L.A. Hart, The Concept of Law (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1961) 60-64. 11 See Elliott's discussion of this point at pp 90-91. 0 The Modem Law Review Limited 2001 505</page><page sequence="7">The Modern Law Review [Vol. 64 However, the recognition of proposition (3) and the variety of ways in which a case may fall under it, means that there is no direct challenge to the will of Parliament until Parliament has had and exercised the opportunity to express an intention upon each of the conditions that might or might not be regarded as an appropriate limitation of the power. On a smaller scale, the super-human qualities required by the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty in its hyper-officious form would be needed here to maintain the position that all the conditions attached to a power granted by Parliament must be authorised by Parliament itself. Yet it is implicit in the acknowledgment by the ultra vires side that the material content of the principles of judicial review are the creation of the courts that this is not presumed. One way out of the apparent lack of an effective notion of parliamentary sovereignty on the ultra vires side is to resort to a romantic view of parliamentary sovereignty. It is, strictly speaking, unnecessary to be conscious of parliamentary sovereignty when the courts are working out the practical determination of the principles of judicial review, but to restrict our perspective in this way misses out on the beauty of the broader picture. The courts are not simply doing their own thing but working in harmony with principles that Parliament also embraces and fully endorses. Something like this seems to be the impetus for Elliott's heartfelt request: In order to acknowledge that the credit lies with the courts for the translation of these norms into enforceable legal principles, it is not necessary to deny that Parliament has long been taken to respect those values. There is no shame in admitting that judicial development of administrative law is consistent with the legislative intention of Parliament. ... [I]t is, rather, the characteristic of a mature democracy in which respect for the most fundamental values permeates each branch of the constitution. (pp 368-369) If it were known that a sovereign Parliament endorsed certain values, then there could be something in an argument that suggested the courts were offering an affront to parliamentary sovereignty by adopting any other values in applying principles of judicial review. However, this takes the ultra vires model onto much weaker ground. A return to the realm of fairy tales Reference is made to two sorts of values by the supporters of the modified ultra vires model, which it is confidently assumed can be regarded as governed by parliamentary intention: the standards of reasonableness, and the values of the rule of law. Essentially the same point can be made about both in revealing the flimsiness of their romantic appeal. They both have an intangible quality when it comes to the point of capturing them in concrete situations. I shall concentrate on reasonableness here, reserving comments on the rule of law for the following section.12 The question whether a power has been exercised reasonably is usually raised by a victim of the exercise of that power, who wishes to challenge it. In court the standard defence in such an action for judicial review is not that the body exercising the power enjoyed the authority to exercise it unreasonably, but that the power had been exercised reasonably. This alone should be sufficient to alert us to 12 Elliott does suggest that reasonableness is one of the requirements of the rule of law (96), but this view is not necessarily a part of the argument whenever it is asserted on the ultra vires side that the requirement of reasonableness must be regarded as being governed by parliamentary intention. 506 ? The Modem Law Review Limited 2001</page><page sequence="8">May 2001] The Theoretical Controversy Concerning Judicial Review the fact that the standards of reasonableness are not settled. Moreover, even if we narrow it down to reasonableness in the context of what purposes the power was granted to achieve, the points of contention simply multiply. What exactly are the purposes? How far is it envisaged that those purposes should be achieved at the expense of competing considerations? If uniform standards of reasonableness existed, it would not matter whether we took those standards as internal to the grant of power or externally imposed. The question whether Parliament intended the power to be exercised reasonably or the courts had imposed the condition would be redundant for all practical purposes (and probably for all theoretical purposes too) if there existed a uniform set of standards of reasonableness known to all. For when Parliament granted the power it would know exactly under what conditions, subject to that uniform set of standards, the grant would take place. And when the courts reviewed the exercise of the power they would simply apply that uniform set of standards to the case before them (and presumably litigation in this area would dry up to leave only disputes over the facts). Only a cynic would suggest that every human endeavour to behave reasonably is a transparent illusion. Nor would it be so fanciful to hold a general presumption that people are capable of behaving reasonably, and in a trivial sense retain the expectation that all will behave reasonably. However, what is being imputed to Parliament is not a lofty view of mankind but an authorisation of a set of standards of reasonableness used for the principles of judicial review, by which hard decisions are made as to which exercise of power was reasonable and which was not. It does not require a cynic to point out that no human effort has so far achieved an intelligible set of standards of reasonableness to determine what amounts to reasonable behaviour in any given situation. It is nothing more than a fairy story to suggest that Parliament has worked out and adopted a set of standards of reasonableness, and a bigger story to suggest that Parliament shares the same set of standards with the courts.13 Breaking the spell of these illusions leads to a number of conclusions. First, the absence of a settled set of standards of reasonableness means that there exists the possibility of dispute over what precise standards should be applied, how they should be prioritised, and how they should affect the outcome, in a particular concrete situation. Secondly, it is worth repeating that without a settled body of standards (unless Parliament works through all practical eventualities and forms its own view upon them), the absence of an intention that a power should be exercised reasonably should not lead us to infer that Parliament was consciously indifferent to the power being exercised unreasonably. Thirdly, we may properly characterise reasonableness as encompassing standards to be worked out before they can be applied, as involving a deliberative endeavour rather than a communicative requirement. Replacing fig leaves The criticism that the reliance on an implied Parliamentary intention was nothing more than a fig leaf used to cover up the courts' own creative role, in producing 13 I leave aside differences between the views of reasonableness of one judge and another. For fierce exchanges on this, see Richard Revesz, 'Environmental Regulation, Ideology, and the DC Circuit' (1997) 83 Virginia Law Review 1717; Harry Edwards, 'Collegiality and Decision Making on the DC Circuit' (1998) 84 Virginia Law Review 1335; Richard Revesz, 'Ideology, Collegiality, and the DC Circuit: A Reply to Chief Judge Harry T. Edwards' (1999) 85 Virginia Law Review 805. 0 The Modem Law Review Limited 2001 507</page><page sequence="9">The Modern Law Review [Vol. 64 principles of judicial review to set the conditions to the powers that Parliament had granted, is less stinging in the light of the modifications that the two theoretical models of judicial review have undergone. Both now acknowledge a creative role for the judiciary. As we have seen, the point of issue remaining between the two models is about who authorises the principles of judicial review that the courts apply with their creative ingenuity to the situations arising before them. Both sides also have described the principles, that each from its own perspective gives different credit for authorising, as amounting to the values of the rule of law. As I indicated in the previous section, it would I think be possible to take the values of the rule of law through the same argument that was employed there on the standards of reasonableness. The result would be to show that the claim by the ultra vires side that Parliament must be taken to have authorised the values of the rule of law as used by the courts in judicial review is as much a fairy story as the claim in relation to the standards of reasonableness.14 However, I think that there is a more worthwhile exercise to be undertaken in considering how the rule of law has been used in this debate. This arises out of the observation that the use of the rule of law differs between the two models. If its use as a prop in a fairy story falls to the ultra vires side, I shall suggest its use as a fig leaf is now more evident on the common law side. I shall actually suggest that the common law side is outdoing the ultra vires side by collecting a wardrobe of fig leaves. On the ultra vires side the use of the rule of law (as with reasonableness) is as an instrument to connect Parliament to the principles of judicial review applied by the courts. The fact that this instrument happens to be a set of values is secondary to the fact that it is regarded as being held in common by both, so that Parliament can be taken to have implicitly authorised what the courts engage in creatively applying. I shall rely on the suggestion made above that the argument developed in the previous section can meet this particular contention. On the common law side, by contrast, the rule of law is used precisely because it amounts to a set of values. This set of values provides an authority for the business of the courts. The different uses of the rule of law relate directly to the outstanding point at issue between the two models. The ultra vires side sees the sovereignty of Parliament as providing the authority for the principles of judicial review so has no need to rely on values in the rule of law to provide authority. The common law side in denying that the authority comes from Parliament, and wishing to divert our gaze from the possibility that the principles are nothing but bare judicial constructs, has recourse to the values seen as inherent in the rule of law to provide authority for the principles that the courts employ. The old fig leaf of parliamentary intention has been replaced by a new fig leaf of the rule of law. This distinction between the two uses of the rule of law is apparent in the following passages. For the ultra vires side Elliott states: It is the simple - and wholly plausible - assumption that Parliament intends to legislate consistently with the rule of law which bridges the apparent gulf between legislative silence and the developed body of administrative law ... (p 96, emphasis added) On the common law side, however, Craig states: 14 That the values (or even the doctrine) of the rule of law are not settled appears from the contributions to this volume by David Dyzenhaus (ch 7) and T.R.S. Allan (Comment). For further discussion, see a particularly pertinent contribution to David Dyzenhaus (ed), Recrafting the Rule of Law: The Limits of Legal Order (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 1999) by Alon Harel, 'The Rule of Law and Judicial Review: Reflections on the Israeli Constitutional Revolution'. 508 ? The Modern Law Review Limited 2001</page><page sequence="10">May 2001] The Theoretical Controversy Concerning Judicial Review Supporters of the common law model have made it clear that they believe that the content of judicial review should be decided in accordance with the rule of law, or normative considerations of justice, which warrant the imposition of constraints on the exercise of discretion. (p 376, emphasis added) This purported derivation of authority from the rule of law presumes, as much as did the purported derivation of authority from parliamentary intention on the ultra vires side, a settled body of values through which the authority can be transmitted. Once we acknowledge the contentious nature of the rule of law, no such settled body of values can be found. At one point, Craig himself acknowledges 'the different meanings attached to the concept of the rule of law' as grounds for his personal preference for 'justice' as a more appropriate term. However, it is clear from his following words that this is not due to the belief that justice provides a settled body of values. Craig wishes only to avoid certain connotations of the rule of law,15 stating himself to be 'perfectly happy to employ the terminology of the rule of law, provided that it is understood that the substantive concept of the rule of law necessarily entails some vision of justice and rights' (p 376, emphasis added). Whose vision of the rule of law (or justice, or rights) is to prevail? The rule of law is not the only device used on the common law side to cover up judges acting on their own authority to determine the scope of the law. Sir John Laws, in his second contribution to this volume (ch 8), makes use of two devices. He first suggests that the authority of the common law in general and its development of judicial review in particular is based on social consent or public confidence, before abandoning public opinion as 'a many-headed hydra' (p 174). Laws then reaches for the notion of principle with a view to convincing us that it provides a 'process [which] confines the judge's own views in a strict and objective context' (p 189). However, Laws' four building blocks of principle - arguments from logic, from consequences, from precedent, and from ideals - only serve to underscore that principle serves a role subservient to whichever body of doctrine, ideological or otherwise, is selected. For none of these building blocks can provide a definite foundation, nor an architectural plan for the building to be constructed.16 Principle may be used as a form in which to express the finished product of the judges but it does not provide the substantive authority for their work. A rather more elaborate device on the common law side is to be found in Dawn Oliver's discussion of a particular set of principles, the 'principles of good administration' (pp 3-4). I need not dwell on the point that what is considered to be good administration is also contentious, and the same point can be made in relation to what may be regarded as a synonymous expression used by Oliver, 'the duties of considerate decision making' (pp 307-308). However, it is important to distinguish between two ways in which these principles or duties can be discussed. It is possible to regard them as providing the authority for judicial decisions, but it is also possible to engage in fruitful discussion under these headings of what factors might be available to be taken into account, and what objectives it might be thought worthwhile to pursue, in formulating principles and in applying them to 15 For Craig's detailed views on the rule of law, see 'Formal and Substantive Conceptions of the Rule of Law: An Analytical Framework' [1997] PL 466. 16 The suggestions that logic provides us with a 'discipline', and that precedent shapes the use of the building blocks into 'a common enterprise' (183), cannot help. The discipline of logic may alert us to what decisions are available, or to what are the consequences of beliefs that we hold, but does not determine which decisions to take or which beliefs to accept. And although precedents once determined may land us all in a particular common enterprise, that is not to say that they have been determined from an enterprise that we have chosen to pursue in common.

Concluding remarks A common thread has run through the dissatisfaction I have expressed with the 'fairy stories' told on the ultra vires side and the 'fig leaves' employed on the common law side. This is their dependence on a non-existent, settled set of values, which could realistically be linked to the principles of judicial review used by the courts - whether as a bridge between parliamentary intention and the principles of judicial review, or in order to provide authorisation for the principles of judicial review. Something else that can be seen as common to the two models, despite their fierce dispute, is an effort to fix the principles of judicial review within the law. On the ultra vires side there is an attempt to subordinate the principles of judicial review to the sovereignty of Parliament, but this is done in a way which does not merely uphold fundamental constitutional doctrine. By tracing the authority for the principles of judicial review used in determining the scope of a particular power to an implied intention regarded as part of the statutory creation of that power, there is retained an appearance of legality to the conditions that the courts impose upon the power.18 In a very different way, the common law side makes a claim for the legality of these conditions, invoking the rule of law, or some other source of intrinsic legal value. What neither side is prepared to countenance is the prospect that the law enacted by Parliament, or found in the principles of the common law, does not provide an answer to the question: what conditions should attach to the exercise of a power that Parliament has created? If it were admitted that the law did not provide an answer to this question, there could be no pre-existing substantive legal authority for the answer, and hence there would be no subject for a debate focusing on where that authority was to be found. The defects discovered in the efforts of both sides to provide an answer, and the nature of the disagreement between the two approaches to the basis for judicial review which has bewildered some of the participants in the discussion,19 both raise the possibility that there is more to what the supporters of the two models are talking about than they know or recognise as lawyers. But lawyers may be reluctant 17 Both roles are apparent in Oliver's work. She treats the principles of good administration as an alternative to ultra vires for the basis of judicial review (25-26) but also admits that 'countervailing considerations' may prevail against duties of considerate decision-making (307). Similarly, in 'The Underlying Values of Public and Private Law' in Michael Taggart (ed), The Province of Administrative Law (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 1997) 218, she treats 'the key values as keystones', but also perceptively acknowledges that the key values 'have to contend with other considerations in the law and legal policy', at 224. Oliver's concern in these essays, and in her book, Common Values and the Public-Private Divide (London: Butterworths, 1999), to identify common underlying abstract values in the law can not provide authority for judicial decisions, otherwise Justinian's identification (Institutes i. 1.3) of the most abstract values of the law - to live honestly, to harm no-one, and to give each his due - would suffice. The problem is that they would suffice to justify a number of conflicting systems of law. 18 Sir William Wade in his Comment sees this as providing an important motive for judges to adopt the ultra vires model if only as a matter of expediency. Jeffrey Jowell suggests that just such a motive may have been behind judicial dicta supporting the ultra vires model (337). 19 See the Comments of T.R.S. Allan and Michael Taggart. Christopher Forsyth's good humoured self- deprecation in using as an image for the debate the Lilliputian controversy over which end to crack open a boiled egg also testifies to this point (396-397). 510 C The Modem Law Review Limited 2001</page><page sequence="12">May 2001] The Theoretical Controversy Concerning Judicial Review to concede that there is not a legal answer, for it implies uncomfortable things for lawyers. One is that if the conditions attached to the exercise of a power granted by Parliament are not in a particular case to be found in the law, it follows that it is not necessarily the job of lawyers to determine them. The second is that if it happens that lawyers are given the job to set these conditions, they should recognise that in doing so they are operating as more than lawyers learned in the law. From this point follows a third uncomfortable implication in raising questions about what skills or qualities we should look for in the lawyers who are handed this task.20 One way of looking at this task emerged in our earlier discussion of reasonableness but can be regarded as characteristic of each of the various abstract depictions referred to as governing this task. It was suggested there that reasonableness as a general objective enjoined a deliberative enterprise rather than a communicative requirement. It was Aristotle who suggested that 'to lay down a law about things that are subjects for deliberation is an impossibility. Therefore men do not deny that it must be for a human being to determine such matters.'21 Then Aristotle was not a lawyer. If these suggestions do have some bearing on the nature of judicial review, the theory of that subject should be concerned not with the authority for the conditions attached to the power that Parliament has granted, but with the issue of whose deliberations beyond the law should determine the scope of the power; in particular, when the scope should be set by the body granted the power, and when by the judges in the courts. This would give prominence to consideration of the role of the judiciary within the theory of judicial review.22 20 Louis Eisenstein, 'Some Iconoclastic Reflections on Tax Administration' (1945) 58 Harvard Law Review 477, 523-526, 534-543, argued that judges lacked the abilities to deal with the essentially non-legal issues of working out the details of tax provisions which should be entrusted to an administrative body possessing the appropriate technical skills. That the non-legal aspect of the judicial role should have a bearing on the manner in which judges are appointed has been suggested by John Bell, in ch 10 of Policy Arguments in Judicial Decisions (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983). More recently, Andrew Fraser, 'Beyond the Charter Debate: Republicanism, Rights and Civic Virtue in the Civil Constitution of Canadian Society' (1993) 1 Review of Constitutional Studies 27, has provided a radical suggestion for the election of judges by the legal community as a solution to concerns that an unaccountable judiciary has been given too much power in interpreting the Canadian Charter. John Yoo, 'Choosing Justices: a Political Appointments Process and the Wages of Judicial Supremacy' (2000) 98 Michigan Law Review 1436, 1461, 1467, considers, 'By constitutionalizing more areas of life and by pursuing the notion of judicial supremacy, the Court itself has shunted normal political activity from the world of policy into the world of Court appointments.' In order to counter this, he suggests that the appointments process should be used to select new Justices who are prepared to 'deny the Court's own supremacy.' 21 Aristotle, Politics, III.xi.8. I use the translation from the Loeb edition by H. Rackham (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1932) except that I prefer 'determine' to 'judge' in the second sentence. Either translation is appropriate for the Greek krinounta, but the former avoids the connotation that we are dealing with a judicial judgment, rather than a human determination. The emphasis on general human determination rather than an exercise of judicial skill is evident from Aristotle' s use of anthropon here in contrast to the use of archon (translated by Rackham as 'official', a term used of the chief magistrates at Athens) in the following passage. 22 Treatment of the judicial role has long been a prominent part of discussion of judicial review in the United States. See, eg, Learned Hand, 'Chief Justice Stone's Conception of the Judicial Function' (1946) 46 Columbia Law Review 696. That constitutional discourse in the UK may operate to blur our understanding of the judicial role is commented on by Neil Walker, 'Setting English Judges to Rights' (1999) 19 OJLS 133, 145. That consideration of the judicial role may gain greater prominence by the enactment of the Human Rights Act 1998 is indicated by suggestions already being made that the practical impact of the Act in a number of areas will depend upon the role performed by the judges.
