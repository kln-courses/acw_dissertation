MARK-recapture methods are important and fre quently used in studies of amphibian population dynamics. By marking and recapturing animals multiple times, ecologists can gather data used to under stand population size, rates of immigration and/or recruit ment, emigration and/or death, rates of population declines or increases, survival rates, and movement patterns (Don nelly and Guyer, 1994). Tagging, banding, tattooing, implants, and pattern recognition are all common forms used by scientists (Schoenborne et al., 1977; Schmidt and Schwarzkopf, 2010; Petit et al., 2012; Caci et al., 2013; Mazel et al., 2013). Toe clipping has a number of advantages over other techniques and therefore is one of the most commonly used methods of identification for mark-recapture studies. Toe clipping is simple, quick, inexpensive, and easy to recognize (Martof, 1953; Guimaräes et al., 2014). In addition, the clipped toes can be used for genetic analyses, provide information on diseases (Gonser and Collura, 1996; Boyle et al., 2004), or in demographic studies to determine ages of animals using skeletochronology (Felton et al., 2006; Cheong et al., 2013). Nevertheless, we have at times found it difficult to obtain Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval for mark-recapture studies employing toe clipping as the marking technique. The effectiveness and ethical nature of toe clipping reached the level of international discussion when Robert M. May wrote in Nature (2004) of the need to address toe clipping and other procedures to which animals are subjected in the field. In fact, IACUCs within the United States are bound by law to address issues of individual distress and suffering rather than issues affecting survival (Perry et al., 2011). Thus getting approval can be difficult when techniques perceived to be painful, harmful, or deadly are involved. Toe clipping is one such technique. In the absence of data, anthropomorphic perceptions can prevail and cause IACUCs to withhold approval for the use of toe clipping as a mark-recapture technique. When considering a method for marking animals for a mark-recapture study, the IACUC and the investigator should consider three points: the cruelness of the method, whether the number of animals one can reasonably mark with the technique is sufficient for the study, and how the marking technique affects the behavior, health, and survival of the subject animals (Martof, 1953; May, 2004; Funk et al., 2005). Several studies address the first of these three points (Kinkead et al., 2006; Langkilde and Shine, 2006; Narayan et al., 2011, 2012; Fisher et al., 2013). All of these studies looked at corticosterone levels as an indication of stress. Three of the studies found toe clipping to be no more stressful than just handling the animals (Kinkead et al., 2006; Langkilde and Shine, 2006; Fisher et al., 2013), while two of the studies found that it was more stressful (Narayan et al., 2011, 2012). The second point must be addressed by the researcher in the experimental design. Finally, one must address the effect of toe clipping on behavior, health, and survival. While a number of studies have attempted to examine this in the field (see Perry et al., 2011 and papers cited therein; Schaefer, 2010; Guimaräes et al., 2014), the statistically most robust studies have shown decreased recapture rates in the field as a function of the number of toes clipped (Parris and McCarthy, 2001; McCarthy and Parris, 2004). However these studies could not determine whether this decline in recapture rate was due to increased mortality or to a change in behavior that caused the frogs to avoid recapture. This is because it is nearly impossible to determine causes of mortality in the field, since one rarely comes across a dead frog or toad. In addition, there are several reasons besides mortality that may make toe-clipped amphibians harder to recapture.

Since it is difficult determine the effect of toe clipping on survival in the field, and since the vast majority of studies to date lack true controls (i.e., frogs whose toes have not been clipped, see Perry et al., 2011), we also saw the need for a laboratory study with true controls whose toes are not clipped, and where survival or death can actually be observed. This study seeks to fulfill that need. MATERIALS AND METHODS We obtained 100 Leopard Frogs (Rana pipiens) from Carolina Biological Supply Co. (Burlington, NC) in January 2003. The study began on 17 January 2003 and was terminated on 18 April 2003. Frogs were placed in control (n = 50) and treatment groups (2, 3, 4, 8, or 12 toes clipped, n - 10 for each group). While 12 toes are more than is normally clipped, we used 12 as an extreme case that would be likely to show an effect, if there was any. The thumbs and the longest toes on the hind feet were not clipped because these are thought to be important for molting and reproduction and therefore are commonly left undipped in field studies (Gräfe et al., 2011). However, since our animals were held in the lab and did not reproduce and could molt in peace without threat or interference, this should not have substantially affected the survival of the frogs one way or another. We clipped the frog toes in a manner similar to that used in the field. We held the frogs firmly in one hand while we used disinfected scissors to clip toes just below the first knuckle. We then disinfected the injured foot with Bactine (Bayer Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA) before returning the frogs to their cages (see Green, 2001; Parris and McCarthy, 2001 for recommendations on using antiseptics). In per forming these procedures, we followed the standard guide lines recommended by the National Wildlife Health Center (Green, 2001). The procedures took approximately three to five minutes for each frog. It should be noted that toes were clipped by several newly trained undergraduates. The control frogs were treated in the exact same manner: we handled them, touched the scissor to their toes, and also sprayed their feet with Bactine. We decided to use newly trained individuals to maximize the chances of uninten tional mistakes and provide a worst-case scenario. The frogs were kept in 5.1 1 plastic shoeboxes with lids measuring 22x34 cm, each lid having wire mesh covering a hole in the lid measuring approximately 15x30 cm. Each box contained dechlorinated water, aquarium gravel, sphag num moss, a brick to sit on, and a PVC elbow joint to hide in. The water level was maintained at a depth of approxi mately 2.5 cm. Cages were cleaned every two weeks and water was added during the week to replace water that had evaporated. The temperature of the room where the frogs were housed was held at 23°C with 23% humidity. Lighting was on a 12 h/12 h day-night cycle. Three times a week, the frogs were fed vitamin-dusted crickets (Fluker Farms Co., Port Allen, LA) ad lib. The frogs were held for a week under these conditions to allow them to acclimate before the start of the study. We carefully watched for any adverse effects. Inspections of the frogs for signs of infection, lethargy, or any other possible effects due to the toe clipping were done daily. With the same groups, we used linear regression to see if any relationship existed between the number of toes clipped 6 8 10 12 14 Number of Toes Clipped 6 8 10 12 Number of Toes Clipped Fig. 1. We regressed the number of toes clipped (x-axis) against the number of days the frog survived (y-axis). This was using data from 0 13 weeks (17 January-8 May). There was no correlation between the number of toes that were clipped on an animal and the number of days it survived. and the number of days the frog survived over the period of 17 January-8 May 2003. These analyses were done using StatView 5.0.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). To determine the effect of toe clipping on survival we performed logistic regression using SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), with the number of toes clipped as a grouping variable and the group with 12 clipped toes as the reference group. Since the number of toes clipped did not seem to make a significant difference (see below) we also grouped the frogs as either clipped or not-clipped and used logistic regression (using StatView 5.0.1) to see if the effect of clipping in and of itself had an effect on survival. Assuming that the decrease in recaptures recorded in Parris and McCarthy (2001) were due to death, we calculated the power of our study to detect the decrease in recapture rates that they calculated as a function of the number of toes clipped. We conducted this using the Power/Sample Size Calculation for the Logistic Regression online calculator (http://www.dartmouth.edu/ —eugened/power-samplesize.php). RESULTS We did not find any relationship between the number of toes clipped and the number of days that the frogs within a group survived (F1i99 = 0.93, P = 0.34; Fig. 1). There was no significant difference between the survival rates of any of the groups (Wald Chi-Square = 3.55, df = 5, P = 0.62). The comparisons to the reference group, 12 clipped toes, and the other groups show no pattern and no significant differences (P &gt; 0.23; Fig. 2). These indicated, for example, that frogs with zero, three, and four toes clipped were 30-60% less likely to survive than frogs with 12 toes clipped, while frogs with eight toes clipped were 50% more likely to survive than frogs with 12 toes clipped. When classified as either clipped or not clipped, we found no difference between the two groups in the proportion of individuals that survived to 13 weeks (x2i = 1.491, P = 0.222).

We compared the number of toes clipped (x-axis) against the percent of surviving frogs in each group after 13 weeks (y-axis). There was no pattern and no significant differences (P &gt; 0.23) between the controls with zero clipped toes (n = 50) and treatment groups (2, 3, 4, 8, or 12 toes clipped, n = 10 for each group). Frogs. Nor did we find any relationship between the number of toes clipped and the number of days that the frogs within a group survived. Even our clipped treatment group with 12 clipped toes, used as an extreme case, showed no significant difference. Our study had an unusually high mortality rate and a necropsied frog showed evidence of a bacterial infection. While this high mortality rate might appear to be a weakness of this study, we argue that it is actually a strength, because the low survival rate is seen in both controls and treatments. If toe clipping were harmful to, or compromised the health of, the clipped frogs, it should make the toe-clipped frogs more susceptible to the disease than those that were not clipped. The fact that both clipped and undipped frogs died at the same rate suggests that toe clipping did not make clipped frogs any more vulnerable to illness or infection than non-clipped frogs. It helps to put our findings in the context of the effect of toe clipping on recapture in the field. Parris and McCarthy (2001) found that the likelihood of recapturing an anuran decreased by 6-18% for each toe clipped after the first toe. Let us assume that the anurans in the studies examined by Parris and McCarthy (2001) were not recaptured because they died and therefore their survival rates decreased by 18% with each toe clipped after the first. In that case, even with the high mortality rate among control frogs, our study had a power greater than 0.998 of detecting decreased survival rates due to the clipping of six or more toes. Even if we assume that survival rate decreased by 6% with each toe clipped after the first, this study had a power of 0.7 to detect the predicted decrease in survival when 12 toes are clipped. In a second analysis, McCarthy and Parris (2004) showed that anurans with eight toes clipped had a return rate of 28% that of anurans with one toe clipped. If again we assume this lower return rate is due to lower survival rates among toe clipped frogs, our study had a power of 0.84 to detect a decrease in survival rate of this magnitude. Thus were the decreases in recapture rates observed in the field in either the 2001 or 2004 analyses cited above due to increased mortality caused by toe clipping, we should at least have detected this among the frogs with 8 or 12 clipped toes. Our failure to detect any difference in survival rates either between clipped and non-clipped frogs or as a function of numbers of the number of toes clipped, strongly suggests that the lower recapture rates documented in field studies and attributed to toe clipping may not be due to decreased survival, but rather are more likely due to changes in behavior that result in avoidance of recapture. Nevertheless, the results of this study must not be applied too broadly. The reanalysis conducted by Parris and McCarthy (2001) and McCarthy and Parris (2004) was of data from terrestrial anurans, i.e., the ground-dwelling Crinia signifera and Bufo fowleri and the tree-dwelling Hyla labialis. By contrast, Rana pipiens are much more aquatic in nature. It may be that infection of clipped toes is more likely to occur in a more terrestrial amphibian where dust and dirt are can adhere to wounds than in a more aquatic amphibian where water can frequently clean the wounds. Nor did we test what effect toe clipping may have on susceptibility to prédation. Even if toe clipping does not directly harm terrestrial frogs and toads, it does not seem unreasonable that clipping the toes of tree-climbing frogs (Hylidae) would make them more vulnerable to prédation than would the clipping the toes of aquatic frogs (Ranidae). Nevertheless, two studies in which the discs of tree frogs were clipped found that toe clipping did not affect the tree frogs and deemed it an adequate marking technique (Luddecke and Amezquita, 1999; Gräfe et al., 2011). Finally, a thorough analysis of the return rate of toe-clipped aquatic frogs has yet to be done. Different species that live in numerous habitats should all be examined on an individual basis. Conclusions.—In their review of the legal, ethical, and scientific ramifications of toe clipping, Perry et al. (2011) conclude that there is little evidence that toe clipping adversely affects survival. However, they did find that there is good evidence that toe clipping reduces the probability of recapture. As stated above, Perry et al. (2011) call for robust studies with true controls (i.e., animals whose toes are not clipped). Our study includes true controls, and our results also strongly suggest that toe clipping does not affect the survival rate of more aquatic frogs. Our study provides further evidence that the decreasing probability of recapture with increasing number of toes clipped observed in other studies (Parris and McCarthy, 2001; McCarthy and Parris, 2004) is likely due to changes of behavior that allow the frogs to avoid recapture rather than increased mortality as a result of toe clipping. We also conclude that conducting controlled laboratory experiments is vital to the ethical debate surrounding the issues of toe clipping since it provides IACUC committees with the data necessary to determine if toe clipping is a viable marking method for the mark-recapture protocols they review.
