<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS American, urban, and modern? For each legend analyzed, Brunvand usually gives European, sometimes East Asian, antecedents as well as rural and historical examples. In his discussion of "The Girl with the Beehive Hairdo," for example, the author quotes medieval English ana- logues about the vain woman's elaborate coiffure becoming a nesting place for a demonic spider (pp. 78-79). What are the specific cultural uses of these widespread themes? And the third question grows out of the second and is related to the text-context dialectic. The first chapter stresses the need for recording and analyzing legend-telling performances in context (pp. 15-16). This message is reiterated in the appendix, "Collecting and Studying Ur- ban Legends" (pp. 197-202). Yet the main body of the book contains classic historic- geographic analyses of legend cycles, fascinating in themselves, but essentially textual and not contextual approaches. The textual approach to legend study may account for the gaps in the otherwise fine bibliography and index. Linda Degh's and Andrew Vazsonyi's "Legend and Belief" in Folklore Genres, edited by Dan Ben-Amos, and American Folk Legend: A Symposium, edited by Wayland D. Hand, are missing, for example. Each of the cited titles does concen- trate on the performance aspects of the genre. Looking at legend-telling at the time of performance and looking at it from the point of distributional patterns of variants result in two quite different approaches to a final question: the problem of truth and falsity in legend analysis. The first concentrates on the uncertainty of the participants in the moments of communication; the second on the analytical verification of falsehood. Although Brunvand's study focuses on the second approach, the first is most useful in analyzing legend-telling as a cultural symbol. I, for one, think that the relationship of reality and fantasy is such an intricate one that I will always look into my car before getting into the driver's seat no matter how many variants of "The Killer in the Back Seat" I have heard! Brunvand's "afterword" (pp. 187-191), however, is a fine summing-up of the cultural possibilities inherent in a study of the genre: "Probably by the time this is being read new ex- amples of false-true tales will already be going around, and these urban legends too will con- tain symbols of our culture and reflections of our lives" (p. 191). In effect, The Vanishing Hitchhiker itself takes on attributes not unlike the cultural symbols it describes. It is a tangible, concrete representation of a folk genre and of an academic discipline. As such, it is a valuable reference point for both, and belongs on every library shelf. Wayne State University JANET L.

Perhaps significantly, however, Venetia Newall refers in passing to "the famous scene in Wuthering Heights" when Catherine Earnshaw's ghost appears. And to some extent the book perpetuates that stereotype: the essentially romantic ghost of the Gothic novel, thrill- ing, rather than horrifying. Even the title's use of the more popular "ghost," rather than "revenant" or "the dead," reinforces the stereotype the editors hope to overcome. The book's emphasis on text rather than analysis also suggests a popular audience. While the editors decry popularizations that simply list ghost tales, several pieces here do little more. Although the contributors offer fascinating and valuable texts, they seldom analyze. The book's major weakness, in fact, is the unevenness of the articles. Several lack collecting data or include questionable sources. A number of the authors seem unaware of the extensive Euro- pean and American research on belief and legend, or of the standard reference works that an- notate such research. As an introductory survey of traditions about revenants and the dead, however, the book is useful. Its strength is its diachronic and regional breadth. As well as more recent material, ar- ticles cover 17th-century British, 13th-century Icelandic, 7th-century Latin-Christian, Classical, and Ancient Near Eastern traditions. Katharine M. Briggs speaks of the British reve- nant; Linda-May Ballard surveys Ulster's death and ghost traditions; Joan Rockwell classifies texts from E. T. Kristensen's Dansk Sagn; Venetia Newall offers an inclusive survey of her work with the West Indian duppy; and Carmen Blacker looks at the Japanese onryo. In "The Environment of Ghosts," Claire Russell argues for a contextual approach centered in family histories. Proposing that we accept "ghost experiences" as fact, Russell concludes that the living call up spirits through guilty association with community-repressed events. Without mentioning Linda Degh's work, Russell appears to suggest a kind of exorcism through community dialectic. Only when the family believes in it and uncovers the inciting in- cident, will the ghost be "laid." But this seems simply a common element in legend forma- tion: events that happened at a spot now haunted, color the legend's text. Theo Brown's model historical reconstruction of Mrs. Leakey's ghost illustrates Russell's point that repressed events reappear as supernormal experiences. Brown proposes that the Leakey family fabricated the infamous whistling wraith, Susannah Leakey. Their aim: to blackmail the Bishop of Waterford, who, with the living Mrs. Leakey's aid, murdered an il- legitimate babe. While Brown admirably reconstructs the family's political and ecclesiastical machinations, she does not explain what we learn about legend formation, nor does she con- sider the social implications of a legend that substitutes a malevolent female ghost for an in- cestuous bishop. The most interesting articles cover material often neglected by the folklorist: early manu- scripts illustrating, for the dead, Hand's "complex of belief, legend, and custom." In offering recurring motifs within historical and cultural diversity, such texts illumine the age and per- sistence of ghost lore. These papers also set forth one of the collection's major themes: the dis- embodied wraith versus the corporeal dead. In H. R. Ellis Davidson's "The Restless Dead," the Icelandic draugr, corpses of the newly dead, grotesquely swollen and black with blood, people a world far from that of Catherine Earnshaw's icy but aristocratic hand. Davidson draws her text of Thorgunna's haunting of Frodwater in Snaefellsness from the 13th-century Eyrbyggja Saga. In the saga, and in the com- parative material Davidson examines, the borders between belief and legend blur. Her support- ing material suggests the origins of the legend's numinosity in the "intense horror of night- mare" that informs folk belief. In contrast, W. M. S. Russell surveys a number of Latin and Greek legends seemingly dis- tant from belief, annotating them with references to festival and funerary customs. He then il- lustrates social attitudes about revenants with philosophers' and historians' commentary. Because of the book's breadth, Russell is able to do little more than list this material, though 358</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS he does offer useful notes, particularly for primary material such as St. Augustine's De cura pro mortuis gerenda, but also for psychical research bypassed by folklorists. Defining "ghost" broadly, R. A. Bowyer proposes that we study the medieval revenant in the context of traditions about all dead souls. Drawing on Latin-Christian materials, Bowyer argues that the medieval ghost (OE gast, "spirit"), whether departing spirit, soul in purgatory, or revenant, shares in an "integrated natural and supernatural order." Thus we should consider all such visions and visitations "ghost stories." This suggestion, implying as it does a belief dialectic, is worth considering. Folklorists commonly exclude hagiographic material from belief legend studies; yet many of the texts contain validating motifs and other elements of the belief legend. Bowyer, however, fails to consider oral tradition when he fur- ther asserts that the medieval world lacks the concept of malevolent revenants. A glance at Davidson's article alone would have shown him otherwise. Thus, by "all traditions about spirits," Bowyer means all Latin-Christian traditions. In a model of synthesis and analysis, J. S. Porter's "Ghosts in the Old Testament and An- cient Near East" shows we can best understand supernatural legends within the context of belief and custom. Too often folklorists have elevated one genre over the others. In placing the revenant within the context of beliefs about the soul's relation to the body, the nature of the underworld, and the dead's premonitory powers, Porter explains the living's hostility toward the dead. The revenant's duality, its share in the powers of the supernatural world along with its continued link to its original humanity, explains its fearsomeness for humans. The best of these articles, then, place the standard notion of the ghost, the revenant, within the larger context of traditions about death and burial, the soul and the otherworld. In so do- ing, they raise the question of what we, as folklorists, mean by "ghost." Is only a revenant properly called a ghost? Or are all dead souls ghosts? Are all specters, including disembodied hands, animals, fiery wheels, and phantom carriages, ghosts? Are spooks or other supernormal beings ghosts? And do they come from the same world as the corporeal dead, the grave? Such persistent questioning, like a branch tapping at the psyche's window, will surely uncover, if not the answers, at least the problem's heart. University of California CAROL L.

Garland Folklore Casebooks Volume 2. Pp. xiv + 312. $30.00) According to general editor Alan Dundes, the Folklore Casebook series has a number of purposes. One is to show by example "something about the range and spread of individual items of folklore" (p. vi). Another goal is to bring data and theory together and to provide in one place representative samples of the scholarship dealing with a particular item or problem. Ultimately, of course, the intention is to upgrade the quality of folklore research, a motive that all scholars should find laudable. But the question is, do these volumes fulfill the aims out- lined by Dundes? Perhaps the best way to answer is by examining each volume individually. The Wisdom of Many, the first volume in the series, consists of 20 essays that certainly do demonstrate a variety of approaches scholars have taken in studying proverbs. Included are general overviews, definitions, discussions of structure and function, examples of proverbs in literary contexts, detailed investigations of individual proverbs, examinations of the use of proverbs in psychological testing, considerations of the value of proverbs in identifying na- 359</page></plain_text>
