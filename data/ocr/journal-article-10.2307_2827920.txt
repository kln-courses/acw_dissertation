<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BADGERS OF THE WORLD. By Charles A. Long and Carl Arthur Killingley. Charles C Thomas, Springfield (Illinois). $39.75. xxiv + 404 p.; ill.; index. 1983. This book is an integration of information and experiences accumulated by two researchers working in different disciplines on different con- tinents but sharing an enthusiasm for a fascinat- ing group of mammals-the badgers. As high- lighted in their preface, the writing style and con- tent of the book walks a tightrope between addressing old-fashioned natural history and highly technical scientific information. In doing so, however, there is often a heavy preponder- ance of personal observations and anecdotal information over pure technical data. The 396 pages of text, figures and photographs are divided into 13 chapters. The production of this work is not of high quality: binding is poor, photographs are variable and many illustrations are difficult to decipher. The organization of the chapters, however, is good. Because of the great diversity of appearance and habits of the many badgers of the world, the authors have devoted the first several chapters to emphasizing unifying characteristics shared by these animals, such as specialized dentition, adaptations for digging, bold markings and musk glands. The phylo- genetic relationship of this diverse group is also well handled in a chapter on evolution which dis- cusses their Holarctic center of origin from an arboreal ancestor and their dispersal into plateaus and plains. Because of the research interests of the authors and the volume of information avail- able, the North American and Eurasian badgers receive the most extensive treatment: there are discussions of the distribution, morphology, natural history, and physiology of the group and of the status of these species. Coverage of other badger groups, unfortunately, is not as complete. The chapters on these lesser-known of the bad- gers of the world have their own special em- phases, e.g., the skeletal and dental character- istics of the Ferret badger, the folklore of the Stink</page><page sequence="2">MARCH 1984] NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 83 badger, specializations for tropical life in the Hog badger and the unique natural history of the Honey badger. This book is enjoyable reading and, in spite of over-zealous anthropomorphism, provides a com- pilation of morphological and behavioral data useful to both the mammalogist and naturalist. HENRY J.
