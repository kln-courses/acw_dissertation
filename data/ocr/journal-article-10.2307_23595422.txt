<plain_text><page sequence="1">Words Turned to Spindles: Gavriil Derzhavin's Poetics of the Machine Tatiana Smoliarova Columbia University Translated from the Russian by Ronald Meyer and Tatiana Smoliarova The history of literature lives by a number of commonplaces. It would be no exaggeration to say that all those who have ever studied Gavriil Derzhavin's lyrics have commented on its picturesque, painterly qualities. Derzhavin's foremost "daring," to use the tide-word of Anna Lisa Crone's influential book,' was his interest in restoring original, material meanings to the "readymade" words of the preceding poetic (or, rather, rhetorical) tradition. "Spelling out" stock epithets, looking at familiar things and places from an unexpected angle, Derzhavin made his readers see anew and "as if before their own eyes" all those "dawns with rosy fingers," "golden moons," and other poetic formulae and clichés).2 Another aspect of the "Word and Image" theme in Derzhavin's poetry, observed by many yet barely explored, is the poet's unique attention to the visible and tangible world. For many years the only work devoted to this topic was Elena Dan'ko's fundamental study l^obra^itel'noe iskusstvo v poespi Derphavina (The Fine Arts in Derzhavin's Poetry, 1940).3 A porcelain artist and historian of porcelain manufacture, Dan'ko concentrated on the pictures, sculptures, architectural monuments, and An earlier version of this essay appeared in Stikb. lacyk.

Derzhavin (Moscow: NLO, 2011)]. The English version printed here has been significandy revised. I would like to thank Ronald Meyer, who is currendy translating Lyrics Made Visible into English, for the great work he is doing. I would also like to express my deep gratitude to the IJlbandus editors, for their interest and patience, and especially to Greta Matzner-Gore for her thorough and thoughtful reading of the text and for the important suggestions she made for its revision. 1 Anna Lisa Crone, The Daring of Derfavin: the Moral and Aesthetic Independence of the Poet in Russia (Bloomington, IN: Slavica, 2001). 2 A subtle analysis of this "refilling of the readymade theme with feeling" ("наполнение готовой темы чувством") is to be found in one of the most comprehensive and fine stories of the Russian ode: N. lu.

To this day this remains the most complete survey of the "visual subtexts" of Derzhavin's work.4 But the problem of visuality and visibility in Derzhavin's poetry is far from exhausted by a listing of the works of art that he saw or might have seen: no less important is the poet's interest in the possibilities of vision and in the process of observation, particularly acute in Derzhavin's later years. Such was the approach suggested by Lev Pumpianksy, who devoted to Derzhavin the most distinguished pages of his uncompleted opus magnum, the History of Russian Classicism, in the chapters that were published only in 2000.5 Understanding "the source of Derzhavin's peculiar vision" was, for Pumpiansky, a possible key to his entire poetry and poetics. And, indeed, it seems that Derzhavin's true discovery was neither the bold color schemes and light patterns of his amazing "poetic tableaux," nor his subtle descriptions of works of art, but the very idea of various "types of vision" corresponding to various objects to be observed (peeped., scrutinized, noticed, examined). Probably the fullest panorama of these objects and the largest selection of available "lenses" may be found in Derzhavin's late masterpiece "Evgeniu. Zhizn' zvanskaia" (To Eugene. Eife at Xvanka [1807]). View of Zvanka from the Volkhov River (detail). Engraved from Evstafti Abramov's watercolor. 1810. (The State Historical Museum, Moscow) 4 The next article devoted to the topic of Derzhavin's treatment of the Fine Arts appeared some thirty years later. See I. Z.

(A Picture of Life at Zvanka), which was later rejected in favor of an "apostrophic" version, mentioning the poet's addressee—His Grace Evgeny (Evfimii Bolkhovitinov), a humanist priest and intellectual, a tireless interlocutor and correspondent of Derzhavin in the last ten years of the poet's life.6 The promise of a descriptive poem, embedded in the original tide, seemed to be substituted for that of an epistle. Yet the poem is no less descriptive for its new tide and new structure: it remains a multilayered description, only shaped (or rather veiled) as an epistie. In the poem, which takes the form of a philosophical promenade shared with the bishop, Derzhavin not only makes a tour of the topoi of his own poetry, but also recapitulates and tests various kinds of description, referring to the visual practices that Russian Culture had acquired and "digested" by the early 1800s.7 In the following pages I will focus on just one of those practices—"didactic" or "encyclopedic" vision—with which Derzhavin experiments to create a striking image of Zvanka's "home industry." The description of Zvanka's domestic production is incorporated into the twelve lines situated right in the middle of the huge poetic canvas of Life at Zvanka (stanzas 33—35): Иль смотрим, как вода с плотины с ревом льет И, движа машину, древа на доски делит; Как сквозь чугунных пар столпов на воздух бьет Клокоча огнь, толчет и мелет. 6 The future Metropolitan of Kiev, in the mid-1800s Evgenii Bolkhovitinov (1767— 1837) was the bishop of Staraia Russa and Vicar of Novgorod. Derzhavin's beloved estate of Zvanka in the Pskov region of central Russia belonged to his diocese, and the priest occasionally came to see the poet in his residence. To commemorate one such visit, Derzhavin wrote Life at Zvanka in the late spring-early summer of 1807. Once accomplished, Derzhavin sent the poem to His Grace Evgenii, accompanying it with a delicate watercolor, made by the devoted steward of the estate and featuring the poet's house, a typical Palladian villa, overlooking the majestic Volkhov River. 7 It is quite revealing that verbs of vision constitute 18% (i.e. almost one-fifth) of the verbs in the poem.</page><page sequence="4">12 Tatiana Smoliarova Иль любопытны, как бумажны руны волн В лотки сквозь игл, колес, подобно снегу, льются В пушистых локонах, и тьмы вдруг веретен Марииной рукой прядутся.

Anticipating the questions of future generations, Derzhavin provides detailed commentary of these twelve lines in his "Explanations":10 • И, движа машину, древа на доски делит: Water-powered sawmill. • Как сквозь чугунных пар столпов: Fire-powered steam machine. • Марининой рукой прядутся: The Empress Maria Fyodorovna ordered a spinning loom from England, at which a single person could operate more than 100 spindles. • Все прелести, красы берутся с поль царицы: A reference to а dye-works, where silk, wool, linen and paper are dyed with grassy dyes, which are gathered from the tsarina of the fields, i.e., Flora. • Куется в бердыши милицьг: At this time, by the order of Emperor Alexander, a militia was raised for the defense of the empire's borders from the French, to this end pole-axes were forged as well as all manner of weaponry. Thus these stanzas all concern domestic objects: a sawmill that runs on water power, steam and spinning machines, a dye-works (evidently, also mechanized) and finally, the smithy, where light weapons are produced. At first glance everything seems clear, but there is something that makes us read and reread these lines in an attempt to decode the supplementary information found here. Is it a matter of the object or the accompanying description? Does it concern what is seen or how it is seen? Let us try to answer this question. The appearance of machines in Derzhavin's text, and in Russian lyric poetry of the early 1800s in general, is both somewhat unexpected and, at the same time, altogether natural. Small cloth and weaving factories, 9 Translated by Alexander Levitsky in G. R. Derzhavin, Poetic Works: A Bilingual Album, trans.

Domestic work had previously been mentioned by poets, but the production itself—with the possible exception of Lomonosov's "Letter on the Usefulness of Glass" (Pis'mo о pol\e Stekla [1752])—had never been the subject of poetic reflection. In this sense Derzhavin's innovation is not only beyond dispute, but also more significant than it might seem at first (and this despite the fact that the running of the estate and its home industry was shouldered by the poet's wife, Daria Diakova, a strict and thrifty woman. For Derzhavin this was all a matter for contemplation rather than active participation). Vladimir Borovikovsky. Portrait of Derzhavin's second wife, Daria Diakova. 1813. (State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow) The machinery is spellbinding. Observing the works is also a work, exhausting in its own way, thus making the artist something of an artisan with definite tasks to perform. 11 The regulated design of the 11 The French literary historian Edouard Guitton, who has authored several monographs on descriptive poetry in France, explains the interest in machinery in French poetry of the mid-century as follows: "Primarily a symbol of technical progress, the machine compelled poets in the 1750s through the 1770s to dream, think and create. These dates coincide with the time of the industrial renaissance [...]. The poet, a mechanic of words and images, competes with the mechanism he sees before him.</page><page sequence="7">Words Turned to Spindles 15 uncomplicated mechanism inspires in Derzhavin the same lively cheerfulness as the "homemade, fresh and healthy provisions" ("pripas domashnii, sve^hii, %drcwyir) that the mistress lays out on the table. What attracts the poet most of all in the "water sawmill" is its regularity and predictability.12 In contrast to the destructive and wild power of Derzhavin's Waterfall (1791), which, sixteen years earlier, had been "breaking pine trees into bits and grinding down rocks into sand,"13 the operations of the Zvanka dam are both calculated and constructive. The thundering flow of the water from the dam "moves the machine," which, in its turn, saws trees into boards. It would seem that the elemental force of nature is completely subordinated to the civilizing operations of man. But that is not the case. The primary feeling that arises from reading the "machine" stanzas is a feeling of a resistant milieu. The steam "beats" (бьет), i.e., forces, its way through a series of "cast-iron columns"; the waves of the cotton yarn "flow" into troughs, but this is also done "through" (сквозь), that is, after encountering obstacles in its path in the form of needles or wheels (or, maybe, wheels of needles). The preposition "through" (сквозь) appears twice, separated by two lines, which creates a certain circular rhythm that forces the reader in a similar manner to force his way through the text. The resisting physical material is given by means of the resisting verbal material. The complex syntactical construction does not so much describe the technical construction as translate it into a language of a new literary concreteness. Derzhavin's imperious treatment of language has been noted by a number of his readers. The subtlest of all, Yakov Grot, writes in his essay "The Language of Derzhavin," included in the ninth and final volume of Derzhavin's Sochineniia-. "He is not afraid of mistakes in grammar and syntax if it serves to render his idea in a clear and sharp image, and indeed he often achieves his goal this way more certainly than if he had Does he adopt technical language or, on the contrary, does he distance himself from it?" (Edouard Guitton, "La Machine dans l'imaginaire des poètes français de 1750 à 1770," Revue des Sciences Humaines Ъ, no. 186-187 [1982]: 96). 12 Yuri Norstein, the renowned Russian animator, similarly writes about being mesmerized as a child by the rhythmic motion of the looms at a woolen mill. According to Norstein, it is the tapping sound of the looms and the "perpetuum mobile" of the looming frames that gave birth to his famous yet unfinished animated pantomime—a reading of "The Overcoat"—more so than Gogol's story itself (Yuri Norstein, Sneg na Trave, vol. 2 [Moscow, 2008], 10). 13 "Ветрами ль сосны пораженны, / Ломаются в тебе в куски; / Громами ль камни отторженны, / Стираются тобой в пески; / Сковать ли воду льды дерзают, / Как пыль стекляна ниспадают" (1:460).</page><page sequence="8">16 Tatiana Smoliarova strived for impeccably pure language, thereby cooling his fiery flights of fancy" (IX: 335). A somewhat different explanation of Derzhavin's "incorrectness" is given by Sergei Aksakov, the future author of The Family Chronicle (1856) and Years of Childhood (1858), in his memoir On My Mcquaintance with Derzhavin (1852): Impadence, I believe, was his main character trait, and I think it caused him a great deal of unpleasant annoyance in his domestic life, and even hampered him in producing a smooth and correct language in his verse. As soon as inspiration left him, he was overcome by impatience and treated the language without any respect whatsoever: he brought to their knees syntax, word-stress and even word-usage [гнул на колено синтаксис, словоударение и самое словоупотребление].14 The number of grammatical and syntactical "mistakes" in Life at Zvanka sets a record—even for late Derzhavin—and the "machine" lines stand out for their level of reading difficulty in comparison with the remainder of the text. The word "machine" itself falls into the muzzle of the poetic machine: the stress, which normally (and in the eighteenth century it was already fixed) falls on the second syllable, is moved to the first— машина—in emulation of the Latin machina. Nevertheless, action holds sway over counteraction. The irregularities in style oppose the regularity of the motion of the saw, as it cuts trees into boards, and the internal pressure of the steam striking the air. In his "Derzhavin pages," mentioned in the opening lines of this article, Lev Pumpiansky contrasted the "verblessness of Lomonosov's enthusiasm" with the "agitation of the predicating capability" of Derzhavin.ъ Indeed, processes generally interest Derzhavin more than subjects. In this sense, as in many others, Life at Zvanka stands somewhat apart: of the poem's 252 lines, only 15 end with a verb (and 10 of these rhyme); thus verbal rhymes comprise slightly less that 4% of all the rhymes in the poem. However, we are not dealing with Lomonosov's verblessness here, but with a conscious, thematic aim for a timeless, static quality (remember the poem's original title). 14 S. T. Aksakov, "Znakomstvo s Derzhavinym," in î^brannje Sochineniia (St. Petersburg: Izdatelstvo O. N. Popovoi, 1909), 485. 15 In other words, according to Pumpiansky, the world created by Lomonosov is static, while Derzhavin is obsessed by motion and its linguistic rendering. L. V. Pumpianskii, "K istorii russkogo klassitsizma," 97.</page><page sequence="9">Words Turned to Spindles 17 Stanza 33—the first of the "machine" stanzas—stands out in particular from the entire text since it is the only stanza in which all four lines end with a verb. Moreover, all are verbs of motion (the one-syllable pair льет—бьет [pours—beats] and the two-syllable pair делит—мелет [splits—mills]). The effect is intensified by the fact that the verbs come at the end of syntactically inverted phrases: placing the verb in the "Latinized" position at the end of the line gives the impression that the verb's placement is the result of a long syntactic struggle. Whereas the verbal rhymes create a rigid structure in stanza 33, there is only one pair in stanza 34 (льются—прядутся [pour—knit]), but the rhyme feels less sharp, because the verbal forms are reflexive. Verbal rhymes seem to disappear altogether in stanza 35 (but in fact verbal assonance is present here as well: берутся—куется [take—forges]; it is concealed in the middle of the lines, but intensified by the syntactical parallelism). The consistent transition from the "verbalness" of the description of the machine's motion back to verblessness creates an image of vision itself: concentrated on the effect the machine's motion creates in the beginning; a bit less attentive in the middle; and once again directed at historical allusions and philosophical generalizations at the end. A similar sense of the gradual dissipation of the ga%e in the "machine" stanzas is aided by the increased percentage of metaphorical text—an increase in the number of tropes and words used in a figurative sense. The poet is armed now not with "optical glasses" but with optical rhetoric: metaphors, metonymies, and similes. If all the words in the stanza describing the operation of the sawmill and steam engine are used with their direct meaning (with perhaps the exception of the gerund клокоча [gurgling/bubbling/boiling up], used in connection with the steam), then the description of the spinning machine that follows presents us with the peculiar metonymy of "spun by Maria's hands" (Марининой рукой прядутся), and the developed metaphor of the "flowing waves of yarn." This traditional metaphor, which goes back to the ancient comparison of yarn to waves, is complicated in this instance by the lexical reshuffling, fleece of waves (руны волн), instead of waves of fleece (волны рун) (this reshuffling can hardly be explained by the demands of rhyme, since the rhyme voln—vereten, even by the standards of Derzhavin's late poetry, is inexact), the anthropomorphic metaphor "fluffy curls" (в пушистых локонах) and the cross simile "fleece of waves [...] like snow flows/streams (snow does not flow/stream; the basis of the comparison is not the action, but the quality—the whiteness of the cotton fiber).</page><page sequence="10">18 Tatiana Smoliarova These examples serve as a striking illustration of Yuri Tynianov's famous concept of the "compactness of the verse series" ("теснота стихового ряда") that results in semantic give-and-take within the verse line, words' mutual exchange of "oscillating signs" ("колеблющиеся признаки значения"), and which is enhanced by the boundaries of the verse line and the restrictions imposed by rhythm.16 Mikhail Gasparov thought that the "compactness of the verse series" was an artifact of sorts—a beaudful idea, but difficult to illustrate. In his opinion, the restricdons of the verse line could not influence the "lexical coloring" directly, but first distorted syntax and only then, implicidy, semantics.17 In Derzhavin's late poetry the distorting influence of syntax on semantics increases as a result of his general orientation toward stylistic incomprehensibility and obscurity, which, among other things, is expressed in the abundance of inversions deliberately introduced into the text.18 They are particularly plentiful in Ufe at Zvanka. Inversion, one of the most powerful expressive devices for poetic language, can fulfill various functions in a poem: it can be ornamental, prosodie, or mimeticf The transposition of words that complicates our understanding of the "machine" lines in Ufe at Zvanka (and there is no straightforward word order in any of these lines!) plays a mimetic, i.e., a graphic role. Syntax does not influence the semantics here, but rather becomes semantic—or to be more precise, it becomes iconic and even performative. It is not by chance that, in their writings on language, Denis Diderot and Louis-Sébastien Mercier equated the lack of inversions in the French language with the absence of those qualities of language that Roman Jakobson would later call its "poetic function." The impossibility of 16 In short, Tynianov believed that, in poetry, words that are situated next to each other actually take on one another's meanings, or shades of meanings.

We bring the words together, we chain them one to another; we do not construct them, we only accumulate them, we wouldn't know how to put them in such a way that they would mutually support each other; circular and (oblique) movements are also forbidden for us; we can but follow the straight line.20 In Derzhavin's poem, inversions serve precisely to structure non linear images. If we translate the machine lines from agrammatical to ordinary language, if we restore the usual word order, and assign all subjects their appropriate predicates, objects, and modifiers, not only would the poetic text be destroyed, but the image would disappear as well. This disappearance would come about because, in this instance, the object of depiction is not a separate subject and not even a combination of subjects, but rather a design, a collection and order of operations that has been carried out. It is precisely this image—the image of motion—that Derzhavin creates in these twelve "machine" lines of his poem; it is precisely this that he is attempting to convey to our shared imaginations. "And suddenly multitudes of spindles / are spinning thanks to Maria's hand." The reader who has not specially consulted the author's commentary, which is printed in some, but not all editions of Derzhavin, would hardly guess the true sense of the word-combination: "Maria's hand." Whose hand is capable of spinning "multitudes of spindles" with a single stroke?21 20 "Nous rapprochons les mots, nous les enchainons les uns aux autres; nous ne les construisons pas, nous les accumulons; nous ne saurions les disposer de manière à se prêter mutuellement de la force et de l'appui; les mouvements circulaires et les mouvements obliques nous sont également défendus, nous ne pouvons parcourir que la ligne droite" (Louis-Sébastien Mercier, Néologie ou Vocabulaire de mots nouveaux, à renouveller, ou pris dans des acceptions nouvelles [Paris, 1801], xlj). In his introduction to Neologisms Mercier writes that his next and last literary project, "the final offering to versification and versifiers," will be a treatise on inversions, which in his opinion is essential for the "dynamic needs of a new century." 21 For now, we'll leave aside the tautological use of the verb "to spin" in connection with "spindles" (вертёна)—rather than thread or yarn—yet another violation of linguistic norms.</page><page sequence="12">20 Tatiana Smoliarova The most natural assumption would be that the reference is to a maiden named Maria—one of the Derzhavins' serfs or hired laborers. Or, one might look to the religious or mystical sphere for an interpretation, in which case it would be the "hand of Mary," mother of God, particularly since purple thread and the Virgin Mary holding a spindle belong to the most ancient and constant elements in the iconography of the Annunciation.

The preceding and following lines are both complex and barely pronounceable. We need to determine what exactly this figure of speech is, what function it performs in the text, and how it relates to Derzhavin's poetics in general. The lines dedicated to the "multitudes of spindles" that are put into the hands of the enigmatic Maria resonate with some classic examples of the sublime in Russian poetry, such as Lomonosov's exposition to "Evening Meditation on the Divine Majesty on the Occasion of the Great Northern Lights" ("Вечернее размышление о Божием Величестве при случае великого северного сияния" [1743]): Открылась Бездна, звезд полна; 22 Звездам числа нет. Бездне - дна. A star-filled vault has opened up; No number is there to the stars, No bottom is there to the vault. 23 They also resonate with lines from his later ode ("On the day of the Acsension to the All-Russian throne of her Majesty the Empress Elizabeth Petrovna, the Year 1747"), describing the amazing multitude of islands spread across the Pacific Ocean: Там тьмою островов посеян, Реке подобен Океан.. ,24 There sown with multitudes of islands The Ocean like a River is.. .25 The multitudes of spindles in Derzhavin's poem are also without number, like stars or islands, and the poet realizes their multitude just as suddenly and with just as much delight as his predecessor.

As strange as it may seem, neither Jacques de Vaucanson's famous mechanical Flutist, nor Castel's Optical Harpsichord, nor the other amusing automatons inspired the poets of the mid-century. Instead they were attracted by improved clock mechanisms, firefighting carts with unusual water systems, clever canon fuses, and even a deftly made prosthesis (the "silver hand" that replaced a soldier's hand lost in battle was the subject of an early lyric by Jacques Delille, the author of the famed Gardens [jardins, ou I'art d'embellir les paysages 1782, 1801]).

The emerging confrontation between nature and technology was smoothed over by the harmonious coexistence of anthropomorphized plants and technical devices in Darwin's verses. Among other pioneering industrialists and natural philosophers, Darwin did not forget his fellow "Lunar Men": in the lanes and alleys of The Botanic Garden, alongside James Watt's steam engine and some of Josiah Wedgewood's pottery refineries, the reader could also run into a new spinning machine, just recently patented by yet another member of the Society, Richard Arkwright.29 Arkwright's innovation, later disputed in court by his competitors, consisted in using waterwheels as the primary movers of the mechanical spinning machine.30 Joseph Wright of Derby.

"The general design of the following sheets is to enlist Imagination under the banner of Science; and to lead her votaries from the looser analogies, which dress out the imagery of poetry, to the stricter ones which form the ratiocination of philosophy" (Erasmus Darwin, The Botanic Garden [London: Echo Library, 2007], 12). Alongside the primary and secondary pleasures of Imagination, Darwin places those of a third sort, namely, the mechanical. 29 For one of the best accounts of the history and significance of the Lunar Society, see Jenny Uglow, The Tunar Men: the Friends who Made the Future, 1730—1810 (London: Faber, 2002). 30Arkwright's "water frame" amounted to a refinement of James Hargreaves's "spinning Jenny," whose appearance and distribution Karl Marx viewed as one of the main causes of the Industrial Revolution in Europe.</page><page sequence="16">24 Tatiana Smoliarova Darwin describes the machine in an excerpt dedicated to the nymph Gossipia, named in honor of a cotton bush bearing the same name: The Nymph, Gossipia, treads the velvet sod, And warms with rosy smiles the watery God; His ponderous oars to slender spindles turns, And pours o'er massy wheels his foamy urns! With playful charms her hoary lover wins, And wields his trident, — while the Monarch spins. — First with nice eye emerging Naiads cull From leathery pods the vegetable wool; With wiry teeth revolving cards release The tangled knots, and smooth the ravell'd fleece; Next moves the iron-hand with fingers fine, Combs with wide card, and forms the eternal line; Slow, with soft hps, the whirling Can acquires The tender skeins, and wraps in rising spires; With quicken'd pace successive rollers move, And these retain, and those extend the rove; Then fly the spoles, the rapid axles glow, And slowly circumvolves the labouring wheel below. Darwin's contemporaries viewed this descripdon as a model example of the interconnection of technology and art, imagination and science. It is with reference to these lines that Anna-Laetitia Barbauld, an influential Romantic writer and poet (who, incidentally, studied chemistry with another "lunartick," Joseph Priestly), opens her meditation on the fate of descriptive poetry in the "post-Laocoon" age in the preface to the new edition of Mark Akenside's Pleasures of the Imagination, which she prepared</page><page sequence="17">Words Turned to Spindles 25 for publication in 1795.31 Barbauld notes that this description, although removed from the "obvious province of poetry," nevertheless "becomes a source of pleasure." The sketch of Arkwright's spinning machine, for Barbauld, represents "the happiest marriage" of the object being described with the language of description: Who does not admire the infinite art with which Dr. Darwin has described the machine of Sir Richard Arkwright? His verse is a piece of mechanism as complete in its kind as that which he describes.32 We do not know which of these two "pieces of mechanism" may have influenced the appearance of the spinning machine in Derzhavin's lines: the object itself, or its poetic counterpart. The French prose translation of The Botanic Garden, published in 1800 by Joseph-Philippe Deleuze, which made its way to Russia in the early 1800s, was well known and widely referred to.33 As far as the object itself goes, the new spinning machine "immortalized" by Derzhavin was a direct descendant of Arkwright's "water-frame," its improved version, known in the history of technology as Crompton's "spinning mule."34 Several of these machines were ordered by the Dowager Empress Maria Fyodorovna from England in the first years of the nineteenth century. In 1804 one of them was installed in the Alexandrovsky textile mill "in the care of the Empress herself," while others were offered to the people of the Empress' close circle.35 This is where Derzhavin's enigmatic explanation, quoted in the opening lines of this article, comes from: 31 Anna-Laetitia Barbauld, "Essay on Akenside's Poem on the Pleasures of Imagination," in Mark Akenside, Pleasures of Imagination, ed. by Anna-Laetitia Barbauld (London, 1795), i-xxxvi. 32 Ibid., iv. 33 Erasmus Darwin, Les Amours des plantes, poème en quatre chants, suivi de notes et de dialogues sur la poésie, ouvrage traduit de l'Anglais de Darwin (Paris, An VIII [1800]); on the reception of the poem in early nineteenth-century Russia, see A.

For Derzhavin and his contemporaries, the English spinning machine, purchased on the Empress's inidadve, represented a case of double optimism. A reliable, tested mechanism—moreover, one that was not overly complicated—each part of which was found to be in harmony with the others, and could be operated with a flick of the wrist, represented simultaneously a metaphor and metonymy of the orderly governmental structure, a symbol of a certain universal efficiency that united all spheres of Bridsh life—from politics to manufacturing.36 And yet, some riddles remain unresolved: although Derzhavin's first hand familiarity with Erasmus Darwin's "model description" of the multi-spindled machine seems unlikely (for the simple reason of Derzhavin's lack of mastery of either English or French), there are some similarities in the two texts that do not look like mere coincidences. If the adjacency of the (rhyming!) images of the "wiry teeth" and "raveled fleece" in two neighboring verses in both poems (cf.: "Иль любопытны, как бумажны руны волн / В лотки сквозь игл, колес, подобно снегу, льются") may be explained by the mechanism itself and the logic of the process, the appearance of the "spinning Monarch" in Darwin's poem,37 and, several lines below, the "technical metonymy" of the "iron-hand with fingers fine," turning the "tangled knots" into "the eternal line" of the thread, does seem to be echoed in Derzhavin's lines. However, in Life at Zvanka, the image of a "spinning Monarch" and the pars pro toto trope of the "spinning hand" come "two in one." 36 It is not a coincidence that Edmund Burke in his "Reflections on the Revolution in France" (1790) saw inefficiency seeping into manufacturing as one of the threats of revolutionary upheaval. A Russian variation on Burke's Reflections, presumably authored by Aleksei Naryshkin (1742-1800) and entitled "Thoughts of an Impartial Citizen on the Violent Changes in France," develops Burke's ideas and at times exaggerates his metaphorical strategy: "The simplest machine breaks down or grinds to a halt as soon as the main spring ceases its despotic rule over its subordinates, and as soon as those latter take to managing beyond their office; hence in all social movements it is absolutely essential that autocracy be on one side and subordination on the other— otherwise society, no longer being in a condition to exist, will once again fall into anarchy and collapse" (Aleksei Naryshkin, Mysli bespristrastnogo gra^pdanina о buinjh frantsu^skikhperemenakh [St. Petersburg, 1793], 72, 77). 37 "With playful charms her hoary lover wins, / And wields his trident, — while the Monarch spins."</page><page sequence="19">Words Turned to Spindles 27 Maria's Hand The substitution of the hand for the whole person is one of the most frequently encountered types of metonymy. The example is cited by all who have ever written on the theory of tropes—from Aristode and Fontaine to Lakoff and Johnson (with the exception of those for whom the contrast of metonymy and synecdoche is fundamentally important; in those instances the semantic shift from the signified "man" to the signifying "part of the body" represents a classic case of synecdoche). Examples of hands living an independent life in literature and art are too numerous to count, particularly since "in contrast to metaphor, which always strives for a certain originality, force and significance, metonymy always adheres to the traditional."38 Let us suppose that "Maria's hand" is the usual sort of metonymy, "the designation of an object or phenomenon by one of its attributes, when the literal meaning is combined with figurative."39 But the hand, which sets in motion the "multitude of spindles," is only indirectly connected to the Empress, who imported the new spinning machine into Russia: one can connect the literal meaning to the figurative only with a great deal of difficulty. In other words, in order to make your way from this "part" (pars) to the "whole" (toto) requires a great deal more steps than usual. Nevertheless, in the given context, this logical structure looks almost natural. Why? To answer that question we must first consider the possible sources of this image, both literary and visual. Emblematic imagery (literal references to established visual representations), combined with pictures that are in principle un representable, is one of the genre-forming signs of the Russian ode. This capacity of the ode, and Lomonosov's odes in particular, to combine freely "word-representations" and "word-concepts"—that is, to move from the referential understanding of the thematic word to the signifying word—was first formulated by Grigorii Gukovsky and recently studied by Kirill Rogov, who established the principles of how a "baroque panegyric visual quality" works in Lomonosov's poetry.40 Strange as it may seem, the three "machine" stanzas—thematically the most contemporary—are the closest to the stylistics of the ode (at least in this particular manifestation, as an organic mixing of what is represented with 38 V.

The "machine" stanzas might be described as visual, but not descriptive, since no whole, finished picture arises from reading them— only visual fragments and details and something of an outline of their interconnection, barely formulated but palpably felt in the text. In the "machine" stanzas, "Maria's hand" represents the same allegorical-emblematic layer mentioned above, and refers the reader to a definite visual source. The "ekphrastic orientation" in the odes of Lomonosov relied on the fact that the reader could quickly supply the corresponding emblem from one of the widely circulated lexicons of emblems, above all, Symbols and Emblems, first published in Amsterdam in 1705 and then reprinted in 1719, 1788 and 1811.41 Although the 1788 edition of Symbols and Emblems by Nestor Maksimovich-Ambodik (the one Derzhavin and his contemporaries would have had at hand) is the best known, at the turn of the nineteenth century this book could no longer lay claim to being the undisputed source of visual subtexts. The perception of iconology as a constant—and singular—collection of references, ready at any moment to communicate an essential visual quotation from the subconscious to the conscious, had already been disputed by another source that could be found in the majority of private libraries among the Russian aristocracy, namely, Diderot's and d'Alembert's Encyclopédie, or rather its eleven volumes of plates containing some 3,000 engravings on miscellaneous subjects. "Didactic" explicative illustration appeared in Europe much earlier— at least two centuries before the Encyclopédie. In the Baroque era it was associated above all with the development of applied optics and geological studies (cf. the numerous illustrations to the works of the German Jesuit polymath Athanasius Kircher), but it owed its wide popularity, which transformed a type of representation into the model of a worldview, to Diderot and d'Alembert. Reflecting on the philosophical universe, so to speak, of the Encyclopédie in connection with Eife at Zvanka itself brings about a peaceful and equal coexistence of science and craft, art and engineering structures, hunting and fishing, farming and weapons manufacturing. Encyclopedic knowledge differs from academic knowledge in that it does not construct new hierarchies; instead, it regards the existing ones with mistrust, and scorns nothing—or almost nothing. Consequently, it has neither center nor periphery; interest in an 41 For an English annotated edition of this book see Emvlemy i simvoly (1788): The First Russian Emblem Book by N.M.

It is precisely the Encyclopedist's image of ideas and his "ability to come to judgments" about the world that becomes the chief object of illustration on the pages of the Encyclopédie.43 The majority of the illustrations have a two-part structure: the page is divided horizontally into two unequal sections. The top depicts people at work— on the street or inside a room, but in either case inside an extensively detailed genre scene; while the bottom part, which as a rule takes up two thirds of the space allotted to the illustration, focuses on the tiny components. In one of the subtlest readings of the Encyclopedia plates ever given, Roland Barthes likened the functioning of these bipartite illustrations to the existence of natural language in Jakobson's conception.44 Barthes compared the upper part (the "vignette") to the linguistic syntagma (here the object—or objects—being described are represented in their wider social context—or, narrative), while he called the lower part the "visual paradigm," which explained the structure and the principle of operation of one or another device by the "declination" of its parts and the "conjugation" of its functions. 42 For an original account of encyclopedic "leveling" epistemology see Jean-Marie Apostolidès, "Le Paradoxe de l'Encyclopédie," Stanford French Review 14, no. 3 (1990 Winter): 47-63. 43 For an annotated English edition of the Illustrations see: A Diderot pictorial encyclopedia of trades and industry; manufacturing and the technical arts in plates, selected from L'Encyclopédie; ou, Dictionnaire raisonne des sciences, des arts et des metiers, of Denis Diderot, ed. with introd. and notes by Charles Coulston Gillispie (New York: Dover Publications, 1959).

From L'Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire Raisonné des Sciences, des Arts et des Metiers The only connecting link between the two components (or, in Jakobson's terminology, "the projection of the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection to the axis of combination" and back) are self standing, or, rather, self-floating human hands, separated from the body and yet threading a needle, spinning satis, and adjusting optical instruments. The hands, hovering over the objects, as it were, are associated with the human presence in the "analytic" part of the illustration (it is precisely this part that is obligatory, structural, and creates meaning, while the genre picture, the "synthetic" part, is missing in many illustrations). The hands serve as a signal of movement, an act, an action.

From L'Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire Raisonné des Sciences, des Arts et des Metiers The appearance of the peculiar metonymy in Derzhavin's stanzas, linking science, art, and technology—three derivatives from the ancient Greek idea of xryyrj—begins to seem natural as soon as we remember the "encyclopedic" hands. Moreover, the very presence of this rhetorical figure (taking into account its optional status, the possibility of easily doing without it) ought to be taken as a reference to a single context, without which in the period under discussion it would scarcely be possible to contemplate or imagine, the harmonic coexistence of man and machine—the world of the Encyclopédie.46 46 An interesting use of the same rhetorical device can be found in Dziga Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera (1929), the fourth part of which is wholly devoted to the fruitful interrelationship between man and machine. In his commentary on this part of the film, Yuri Tsivian writes: "frames 110—114 are made up almost entirely of close-ups of hands executing different kinds of work: the hands of a typist, laborer, pianist, cashier, hairdresser, camera-man, editor, and so forth. Moreover, as is the case throughout the film, the choice of these "moving hands" is not accidental and their sequence is not haphazard, but visually develops and comments on a certain motif [...] Thus, part IV in the film, Man with the Movie Camera, is remarkable for being structured according to a métonymie principle. The proclaimed theme of "labor" is accompanied by the theme of "participation," here given in the very principle of the construction of film language—a part instead of the whole" (Yuri Tsivian, Istoricheskaia retseptsiia kino: kinematograph v Rossii, 1896—1930 [Riga: Zinatne, 1991], 372).

Scholars have frequently noted that changing the normal order of verbal or visual elements leads to the exposure and isolation of these elements.47 Inversion as a stylistic device can be read as an analogue of the analytic, disjointing vision that is the basis for the illustrations in the Encyclopédie. Elements of a once unified text stand in the same isolated, emphatic position as the part of the mechanism that has been disassembled in the lower, "paradigmatic" "compartment" of the two-part illustrations. In this way, Derzhavin captures both the Encyclopedists' interest in, and approach to, the mechanical organism. The multi-staged system of "tropological communications" that permits us to connect "Maria's hand" with the image of the crowned head of its owner corresponds in all respects to a complex system of mechanical gears, which make it possible to put into motion a multitude of spindles, all under the control of one person.48 The hand, which almost seems to have forgotten about its own body, is in perfect harmony with its larger context. It is built into Derzhavin's poetic machine, where accents become detached from their ordinary positions, where steel and wax exchange their physical characteristics, and words change their place and meaning. Cinema in Russia and Its Cultural Reception, trans. Alan Bodger (London: Routledge, 1994). However, the quotation above is translated directly from the original Russian text, as the entire section dedicated to a "close reading" of Man with the Movie Camera did not make its way into the English, significantly abridged, version. 47 Boris Tomashevskii writes: "In inverted constructions a redistribution of the logical accent and the intonational isolation of the word takes place [...] the words resound more expressively, with more weight" (Boris Tomashevskii, Teoriia literatuij. Poetika [Moscow: Aspect Press, 1996], 75). 48 For this image of the "tropological communications" of the text I am indebted to Alexander Zholkovsky, whom I would also like to thank for other suggestions made upon reading an earlier version of this article. My entire approach to Derzhavin's texts was much inspired by Zholkovsky's and Sheglov's studies of the "poetics of expressiveness" and especially by this article: A. K. Zholkovsky, "How to show things with words" (об иконической реализации тем средствами плана выражения), in А. К. Zholkovsky and Yu. К. Sheglov, Raboty po poetike vyrasritel'nosti (Moscow: Progress Universitet, 1996), 77-92.</page></plain_text>
