By Luc DE HEUSCH. Brussels: Institut de Sociologie, Universite Libre de Bruxelles. I966. Pp. 471. In the broad scope of the traditional history of the Interlacustrine region of East Africa, perhaps no problem is more complex, nor more interesting, than that of the Cwezi (or Chwezi), the powerful figures with one foot among the gods and one foot in the world of man. These figures, recalled through spirit- possession in most of the Interlacustrine region, are remembered in traditions which are, by nature of their religious character, difficult to use in historical reconstruction. The Cwezi are said to have dominated most of the region for some two or three generations in perhaps the fourteenth or fifteenth century, only then to disappear (variously, to the south, down a hole, to the slopes of a volcano), later returning to possess people from time to time. Some of their power may be attributed to their association with 'sacred kingship', the intro- duction or beginnings of which in the region may have been contemporaneous with their living dominance. The sounder opinions concerning the Cwezi are largely built on collations of archaeological data and the small body of traditions in which they are mentioned. Few scholars have tried to approach the Cwezi problem through structural analy- sis of the Cwezi cult and traditions past and present. Now comes a far-reaching work which undertakes such an analysis-Le Rwanda et la civilisation inter- lacustre, by Luc de Heusch of the Universite Libre de Bruxelles. De Heusch does not restrict his attention to the spirit-possession cult. He examines such other problems as the emergence and growth of the Rwanda kingdom, the transformation of a clan structure to a caste structure, and the applicability of the term 'feudalism' to Interlacustrine social systems. But his central theme is the spirit-possession cult as it developed out of the collapse and defeat of the brief Cwezi dynasty. The author, accepting the historicity of the Cwezi rulers, attempts to set them in historical context. He focuses upon the defeat and flight of the Cwezi, crucial, according to his own thesis, to the emergence of the Cwezi myth and the possession-cults built around the central Cwezi figures. Concerning this demise of the Cwezi, the author departs considerably from the scheme set forward by Oliver in the History of East Africa.' The central variance concerns the position of the Hinda, the founders of a number of kingdoms in the southern and western parts of the Interlacustrine region. De Heusch draws on Haya traditions which assign Kibi I, founder of the Kiziba kingdom, to the lineage of the Mukama of Bunyoro, through Ruhinda, the eponymous Hinda. Haya testimony also asserts that the Bito royal clan in Kiziba is related to the Hinda clan. This leads de Heusch to the conclusion that the Hinda are, like the Mukama of Bunyoro, Nilotic Bito. In the author's 1 Vol. I (Oxford, I963), I80-7. 41-2</page><page sequence="2">scheme, the Hinda left their Bito brothers in Bunyoro and travelled southwards, by-passing the Cwezi strongholds in the area to the south of the Katonga River. Later, pushing north, the Hinda inflicted a terrible defeat upon the Cwezi, who then fled northwards, politically impotent. De Heusch proceeds to build a chronology for the establishment of the 'Bito Hinda' south of the Cwezi strongholds. He calls upon the Nyoro tradition that Mukama Winyi I of Bunyoro sent Kibi I to Kiziba. Winyi I was the father of Olimi I, whose reign is associated with the eclipse at Biharwe, almost certainly dated I520. According to de Heusch, this would suggest a late fifteenth-century date for the establishment of a 'Hinda Bito' prince on the throne of Kiziba and a similar date for the defeat of the Cwezi by the Hinda. This chronology, as built on the Kiziba tradition, is very much out of rhythm with events as described by other traditions. There is nothing qualitative about Haya traditions that give them precedence over traditions from the rest of the region. The Biharwe eclipse date also associates Olimi I, the son of Winyi I, with Ntare I of Nkore (Ankole), who presumably reigned in the third generation after Ruhinda, the founder of the Nkore dynasty. If Ruhinda picked up the pieces of the ruined Cwezi kingdom, three generations elapsed before Olimi I entered the scene and two generations elapsed before Winyi I, who sent Kibi I to Kiziba, reigned. As well, Winyi I is in the third generation of Bito rulers of Bunyoro, and de Heusch's view would suggest that the two generations of Cwezi rulers coincided with the first two generations of the known Bito rulers of Bunyoro, given the destruction of the Cwezi empire in Winyi I's reign, or even later. Moreover, from both Nyoro and Ganda traditions, it is clear that Winyi I reigned at the same time as Kayima of Buganda. Kayima ruled Buganda some five generations after Kimera, almost certainly a Bito related to the ruling house of Bunyoro. Relative to other royal houses in the region, de Heusch's scheme seems out of step, and the problem may lie with the Kiziba tradition. Oliver's view on the defeat of the Cwezi and the position of the Hinda would seem to be the more acceptable on the basis of present knowledge. Oliver suggests that the Hinda were Hima pastoralists, and not Bito, who fled south in the face of the early penetration of Nilotic Bito into the Interlacustrine region. The Cwezi were attempting to extend their control northwards (rather than fleeing north) when their kingdom fell apart from internal problems and from Bito pressure on the northern flank. The Cwezi fled, and Isingoma Mpuga Rukidi, the first known Bito ruler of Bunyoro, picked up the pieces of the Cwezi empire in the north and the Hinda, under Ruhinda, inherited the southern part of the Cwezi world in the Karagwe and Nkore areas. From Karagwe, the Hinda sent out princes to rule in southern areas. There was one exception: Kiziba came under the hand of a Bito prince from Bunyoro. De Heusch's interpretation of the Cwezi defeat in terms of a 'Nilotic Hinda' conquest is only the first part of his discussion of the emergence of the Cwezi myth, its diffusion with the Hinda, and the related emergence of the spirit- possession cult. The rejection of this 'Nilotic Hinda' conquest scheme does not necessarily mean that we must reject the whole of de Heusch's analysis of the Cwezi cults, or even a major part. If one does accept that the Hinda were Hima, as Oliver suggests, perhaps more thought must be given to the political culture of the Hima in the pre-Cwezi era (and were the Cwezi Hima?) about which only the barest outlines are presently discernible. De Heusch has pointed 652 REVIEW ARTICLE</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW ARTICLE 653 to the very important place of the Tsoobe clan (probably Hima) in Rwanda history, and others have pointed to the importance of the Hima Lisa and Hima Sita clans in the political realms of the pre-Cwezi Interlacustrine world. Today the Hima are primarily an economic layer of western Interlacustrine society. Their common physical appearance may be due to factors of nutrition and social selection as much as to the genetic factor. Was there once a defined 'Hima' ethnic group which entered the region and introduced, among other things, certain concepts of kingship ? Were the Hinda and Cwezi groups both descendent from this Hima parent? These questions thrust at the very point where knowledge of the traditional history of the region is at its weakest. De Heusch's very thorough analysis of one institution, the possession cult, may perhaps suggest new schemes by which to define early ethnic groups, power centres, routes of cultural diffusion, and centres of cultural evolution. The author undertakes both a synchronic and diachronic analysis of the cult. The study is largely of a secondary nature, relying particularly on the works of Arnoux, Johanssen, Pages, Coupez and Kamanzi, Bosch, Vansina, Oliver, and Zuure.2 De Heusch describes the spirit-possession cult, the Kubandwa, as one of four elements of the traditional religious system of the region's peoples. The other three elements are the ancestor cult, divination, and sorcery. His synchronic analysis of the structure of the spirit-possession cult concentrates on the Rwanda example. De Heusch sees the cult spirits as basically beneficent in contradistinction to the malevolent ancestral spirits. Cult novices pass through two stages of initiation into the cult. Both rites are full of symbols which point to possible historical associations. In the first stage the initiate comes to under- stand the spirits, while in the second he becomes a medium. Spirit-possession in Rwanda is temporary and is not accompanied by the hysterics, nervous expression, or loss of consciousness typically associated with it. The imperman- ence of the possession leaves the initiate in two worlds, one profane and one sacred, rather than cutting him off completely from the world of man. The author points out some of the variations in the cult structure within the region, but the substantial variations are revealed in a comparative discussion of the most important spirit-figures themselves and the varying roles they play in the different traditions. In Rwanda, the central spirit-figure is Ryangombe, and Ryangombe is found as a spirit-figure in most of the southern part of the region- Rwanda, Burundi, Buha, Busumbwa, and Bunyamwezi. In Bunyoro, Toro, and Buhaya, it is Wamara who is the central spirit-figure. De Heusch examines these two figures and the traditions that surround them. The author's basic thesis is that the two streams of tradition describe basically the same event-the dissolution of an empire and the defeat of a cultural hero. Wamara's defeat is the 2 A.

Ryangombe, in the author's view, is in fact the Rwanda king Bwimba. Bwimba ruled in the sixteenth century and died in the defeat of his kingdom. What follows is an historical outline of the de Heusch thesis for the trans- formation and transposition of the Wamara cult and tradition to the Ryangombe cult. The Wamara tradition and cult developed first among the Hinda conquerors of the Cwezi. The victorious Hinda (ca. fifteenth century) legitimized their newly won political roles by tying themselves to Wamara, the 'disappeared' leader of the Cwezi. The Wamara cult and tradition diffused with the Hinda. The traditional ritual patterns of Bunyoro, perhaps distributed throughout the region already, were well integrated into the Wamara cult. De Heusch suggests that the Ryangombe concept was carried north from the Buzinza area into Karagwe by the Nyambo Zirankende clan. Later, in the sixteenth century, this clan fled from Karagwe (where the Wamara cult and tradition were already important) to Bugufi on the southern fringe of the Rwanda state. Before the end of the sixteenth century, the Nyambo Zirankende conquered the Gisaka state ruled by the Zigaaba, a Tuutsi clan. War followed between the Rwanda state ruled by Bwimba Ruganzu and the Gisaka state. Bwimba Ruganzu, the Rwanda ruler, and his sister were either killed or committed ritual suicide in the defeat of their kingdom. Rwanda recitations disguised Bwimba's defeat as a great liberation of the Rwanda state. Bwimba's defeat is quite parallel to Wamara's defeat and the cult, in its Rwanda form, developed around Bwimba-Ryangombe. In the early seventeenth century, when Ruganzu Ndoori, a Hinda from Karagwe, entered Rwanda to seize the state and establish a new dynasty during a civil war, it was around Ryangombe that the opposition to his take-over coalesced. The Wamara cult and tradition, expounded and diffused by the Hinda, became in Rwanda an anti-Hinda cult with its central figure the Rwanda hero Bwimba- Ryangombe. The cult underwent further transformation and diffused from the Bugufi area (associated with the Nyambo Zirankende settlement) south of Rwanda. This is the historical crux of de Heusch's thesis of the transposition and transformation of the Wamara cult. In his discussion, de Heusch throws a good deal of light on the history of the region in the epoch between the beginnings of the Cwezi empire (ca. fourteenth century) and the establishment of the third Rwanda dynasty (ca. seventeenth century). The author has concentrated on the structure both of the cult and of its traditions. There are certain other aspects of Interlacustrine spirit-possession with which the author does not concern himself, but which are of interest to the historians of the region. Grouped around Wamara and Ryangombe, whom the author does discuss in detail, are the pantheons of gods or spirit-figures associated with spirit-possession. Some of these spirit-figures, such as Mukasa and Kagoro, are enshrined through most of the region. This includes Buganda, not usually associated with the Wamara cult, and Busoga, where there is a Cwezi-associated pantheon but no structured Cwezi cult. Three questions emerge from reading De Heusch's volume, questions which the author does not discuss at length but which attract the historian interested in the traditional history of the Interlacustrine region. Who were these secondary gods and spirit-figures of the different pantheons? Were they living persons? Have they any historical significance? 654 REVIEW ARTICLE</page><page sequence="5">In the Interlacustrine region, there may be as many as 350 such spirit-figures or 'deities'. We should distinguish 'deities' from ancestor spirits.3 In the anthropo- morphic spirit world, the ancestor spirit is important only to the descent group of that ancestor. The deity's spiritual importance is not limited to any particular descent group. The spirit-figures of the kubandwa in the Wamara and Ryangombe spheres, and in Buganda, where there is no structured cult of initiation, are 'deities'. Of the some 350 deities of the region, about fifty are worshipped in more than one traditional society. The Ssese Archipelago, in the north-west corner of Lake Victoria, is a veritable hive of deities, some sixty deities being associated with the Ssese Islands. While some of these deities are prominent particularly in Buganda, many are associated with other parts of the region. Some Ssese deities are found in the various pantheons associated with the Wamara and Ryangombe traditions. Foremost among them is Mukasa.4 According to Bunyoro traditions, Ndahura, the first Cwezi king, gave the Ssese Islands to his step-brother Mugasa. In Buganda traditions, Mukasa is the central figure of the Ssese pantheon. His supposed forefather who came to the Ssese Islands was Bukulu. In the pantheon traditions of Ankole, Buhaya, Buzinza, Rwanda, Buha, and Bunyamwezi, Mukasa plays a significant part. In Rwanda traditions, Mukasa is a ferryman remembered as a son-in-law of Ryangombe. In Ankole, he is supposed to have committed suicide when Wamara and the Cwezi left the country, and Mukasa's companions then established themselves on islands in Lake Victoria. In both Buganda and Kiziba he is remembered as the spirit of the Lake, and in Buganda he is the chief of all deities. In Buhaya, Mukasa is remembered as one of those who accompanied Wamara in his disappearance into the underworld. In Busumbwa, he was, with Ryangombe, the co-founder of the mystery world of Ryangombe. In the Buvuma Islands in the northern part of the Lake and in Busoga he is prominent and known by the name Meru.5 Accepting that Mukasa is the central figure of the Ssese pantheon and is associated with the Ryangombe and Wamara pantheons found throughout western Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and north-west Tanzania,6 who were the deities related to him in the Ssese pantheon? Mukasa's supposed brother Kibuuka can be associated in Busoga traditions with Kibwika who, from a base in South Busoga, carried out a series of conquests and colonizations around the lake. Later, in Buganda, Kibuuka, a warrior from Ssese, was to save the country from a military defeat. In Busoga, descent groups related to Mukasa, to Kibwika, and to several other deities prominent in the Ssese Islands and elsewhere, are of the Reedbuck totem. The Reedbuck groups are among the earliest settled of the present-day peoples of Buganda and Busoga. In many cases, particularly in Busoga, deities are attached to particular clans by traditions of paternity. In the Buganda and 3 Both these types of spirits can be distinguished from non-anthropomorphic spirits. 4 Variously, Mukasa, Mugasha, or Mugasa. 5 This discussion draws on a large number of sources, but particularly the works of Apolo Kagwa and the traditions which I was able to collect in Busoga with the assistance of a grant from the Central Research Fund of London University and a Postgraduate Exhibition from the School of Oriental and African Studies. 6 In this volume, de Heusch describes how the Ryangombe-Cwezi cult was introduced to the Luba empire in the nineteenth century by the Yeke conquerors originally from Bunyamwezi (pp. 362-3). 655 REVIEW ARTICLE</page><page sequence="6">Busoga areas, a particular clan would act as caretaker and medium of the particular deity. This suggests a relationship to the deity through marriage or through maternity parallel to the custom in Buganda concerning the caretaking of a king's shrine. It is possible to suggest clan relationships for most of the deities prominent in areas where there is an extensive knowledge of clan histories and traditional clan duties. This would not apply throughout the region. In Rwanda and Ankole, for example, the corporateness of the clan has all but withered away, and with this demise of the clan have gone the histories of the clan units which were at one time significant. So the possibilities of relating deities to particular clans by paternity, maternity, or marriage are limited. But in Busoga and Buganda, and perhaps in Bunyoro and Buhaya as well, the possibilities are better. The evidence suggests the frequent deification of ordinary men according to two patterns. The first is that an ancestor is remembered in his local clan setting by a shrine where offerings are made by his descendants. Over a time, clans may disperse and people from different clans move to the area formerly occupied by the one clan. The newcomers also make offerings to the other clan's ancestor and in this way the ancestor spirit becomes more than a spirit of the descent group alone. He becomes, by our earlier definition, a deity. This spirit-figure is typically a stationary character. The second pattern is one in which a prominent person, through his very mobility, prominence, and dominance, is remembered, and perhaps cherished by the descendants of those with whom he came in contact. This evolves into a deification. Wamara may be the supreme example for the Interlacustrine region of this second pattern of deification. The very important spirit-figure Kintu is perhaps an exception to this scheme. Kintu's mobility, prominence, and dominance in the Interlacustrine region may have been alto- gether incorporeal. There seems to be no institution which would differentiate spirit-figures according to their pattern of deification. But the second type of deity tends, by his very mobility, to be more prominent than the first. A later process of diffusion may occur whereby the traditions surrounding the spirit-figure are passed to other peoples.7 Sacred kingship can be associated with the second pattern of deification, but this would require a treatment beyond the scope of this article. An interesting aspect of this problem is that in the western part of the region,. where Wamara and Ryangombe are significant pantheon chiefs, the spirit- possession cult, complete with initiation, is prominent. Where the cult is not significant in its structured form-in Buganda and Busoga, for example-the clan, perhaps historically associated with the deity, is the significant unit for the caretaking of the traditions and customs of the deity. This may tie in with de Heusch's thesis that the clan necessarily gave way before the caste, that the two are structurally incompatible. The cult is not structurally incompatible with the caste, but the cult is, according to de Heusch's Rwanda analysis, anti- caste, as well as anti-king. The Rwanda cult may be then, as de Heusch suggests, the institution of opposition to both the caste system and the third dynasty of Ruganzu Ndoori. There is no reason to believe that the cult structure, including 7 An interesting example of this, besides the Bunyamwezi-Luba extension of the Ryangombe cult, was the nineteenth-century diffusion of the Nabingi (or Nyabingi, Nabinge) spirit-figure tradition. Diffusing northwards, this tradition was taken up in parts of Rwanda, Kigezi (in Uganda), and as far north as Ankole. 656 REVIEW ARTICLE</page><page sequence="7">initiation, was contemporaneous with the probable earthly activities of the cult figures. The cult structure may have evolved at a somewhat later date, drawing both on the reserve of traditional magico-religious practices and belief, and on the most prominent of the local deity-figures. If we accept these hypotheses, we can separate the deities from the cult structures that did evolve. These deities can then be considered along with the spirit-figures of Buganda, Busoga, and elsewhere where the cult structure did not develop. This done, the deities of the Ssese Islands appear very significant, and the traditions relating to them in Buganda, as well as in the western areas, suggest that the Ssese Islands may have been the place of retreat of the Cwezi people. It is in Ssese that a new world emerged for the refugees from the west. The genealogy of the Ssese pantheon may be a recent fictionalization, but the pantheon itself includes the figure Wamala (Wamara). Wamara is only of fringe significance in Ssese 'mythology', as is Mukasa in the 'mythology' of the peoples to the west. There are contacts and interrelationships on a good number of other points among the Mukasa, Ryangombe, and Wamara traditions. De Heusch has discussed in detail the Ryangombe and Wamara relationships. A work of similar scholarly merit on the Mukasa traditions and the Ssese pantheon, as a probable third locus of the Interlacustrine deity world, would be of great historical interest. The historian must not summarily dismiss traditions generally associated with the mythological world. De Heusch has shown that a close, comparative examination of the structure of the Interlacustrine spirit-possession cults and the traditions surrounding them can bring forth a fresh synthesis of some of the early traditional history of the region. A microscopic examination of histories of descent groups associated with deities could possibly shed more light on the history of the region. The reconstruction of this epoch promises to be the most tenuous for historians working from oral sources. Yet, the placing of deities, very likely the notables of their era, in an historical context could define pre- dynastic dominant groups, political units, ethnic centres, and ethnic migrations. De Heusch's study, which places Wamara8 and Ryangombe in a structural and historical context, is a significant contribution to this task. 8 De Heusch accepts Oliver's historical analysis of Wamara (ref. note i above) with a few reinterpretations. 657 REVIEW ARTICLE</page></plain_text>
