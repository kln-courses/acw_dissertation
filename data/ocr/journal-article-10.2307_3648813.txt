(MaJIeBHI, "XYAOiXHHK," 1920-x rogOB)2 By November 24, 1920 (the date of the letter to Gershenzon quoted above), Malevich had already created Suprematism,3 painted the famous "Black Square," founded UNOVIS4 at the Popular Art Institute in Vitebsk, exhib- ited his work at virtually all important avant-garde forums in Russia at the beginning of the century, and even had his first retrospective exhibition.5 A friend and collaborator with Futurist gurus such as Khlebnikov, Kru- chenykh, Matiushin and Mayakovsky, to name but a few, he was a star in his own right. His artistic innovations had been hailed as nothing short of a "liberation" of the "New Art" from the confines of the object-driven world of the old (and not so old)6 masters. Not only an artistic approach to reality, but also a philosophical basis for understanding creativity per se, his Suprematism demanded a fundamental shift [sdvig]7 in man's relationship to the surrounding world. Such a "shift" was badly needed in the new Bolshevik regime, and many artists followed in Malevich's steps in search of the "ulti- mate reality" (Simmons 230). Why, then, did Malevich feel so insecure in his own work that he repeatedly8 asked Gershenzon, the well-known scholar of SEEJ, Vol. 48, No. 4 (2004): p. 567-p. 592 567</page><page sequence="2">568 Slavic and East European Journal literature and Russian history, to act as his "mirror" in whose reflection the artist could gauge correctly the value of his ideas? The first thing that has to be noted in response to this question is that Malevich's anxiety is connected with a specific part of his artistic output - his written works. As he explains in another letter to Gershenzon from Nov. 18, 1919, he "strove to be clear and talked only about the heart of the matter," but the more clear his thought became, the less comprehensible it was to the audience: "chem tochnee, tem temnee [the more precise, the more obscure]" (Malevich 1995, 3: 332).9 His preoccupation with the abil- ity of language - be it written or spoken - to convey meaning runs through all of his philosophical treatises in one way or another. Yet it is nowhere more obvious or, appropriately, more central than in his theory of poetic discourse, which he delineated during 1918 and 1919, and recorded in the article "O poezii" [On Poetry].10 This essay, as we shall see, purports to do for poetry what the earlier "From Cubism and Futurism to Suprematism" [1916] had attempted to achieve for painting --describe its "nature," out- line its past and present developments as clearly and succinctly as possible, and, finally, point to its goals for the future (for painting, it was to be Suprematism, for the verbal arts - zaum). The last moment is of particular significance for us here, as it suggests an intrinsic connection between Suprematism in art, and zaumnyi realism in poetry. I will return to this point presently. "O poezii" ends with Malevich's own example of the language of the true budetliane" [men of the future]: YJI3 3JIE JIEJI JIM KOH CM AH OHOH KOPH P14 KOACAMBH MO3HA J13)K CABHO OPATP TYJIO)K KOAJIHBH BJIECTOPE THBO OP3H3 AJIH)K This short work is the only one of his poems published during his life- time. Yet Malevich tried his hand at poetry writing on a regular basis12- certainly from 1909 to the mid 1920s, as testified by the new, and to date most complete collection of his poems Kazimir Malevich. Poeziia, issued in Moscow in 2000.13 What are we to make of this suspicious absence of his poems from the early public presentation of his oeuvre? And, even more importantly, now that we have access to them, how are we to judge Malevich's poetic contributions to the Russian avant-garde movement at the beginning of the twentieth century? Or, in the paranoid words of the artist himself, was his verbal art a "wooden bicycle" amid masterpieces, and how is one to tell? The rest of this paper will address these questions with the help of excerpts from Malevich's own writing as, and about, poetry.</page><page sequence="3">Malevich's Poetry: A "Wooden Bicycle ... Background of Masterpieces"? 569 The Artist at Large. Malevich as a Theoretician of Poetic Discourse. In his excellent essay "Kazimir Malevich and the Energy of Language," John Bowlt makes the following remark: "The pictures he painted are conspicuously absent in his written texts. Nor does a reading of the essays clarify the meaning of the paintings. It is as if the essays were written in spite of, or counter to, the visual works" (181). With one notable exception (the article "On Poetry" mentioned above), the statement would still be true if we were to replace "pictures" with "poems": Malevich's poems, as we are about to demonstrate, rarely comply with the zaumnyi ideal pro- jected in the theoretical essays. At the same time, one can argue that even if the essays do not help much in uncovering the hidden "meaning" of the paintings/poems (in terms of their conceptual message), they prove to be invaluable as far as the peculiar treatment of the medium is concerned. To put it differently, it is somewhat unfair to expect that Malevich, the prophet of nonrepresentational art, should be concerned with looking for meaning in objective reality or explaining his message referentially. After all, accord- ing to his credo, the medium is the message. Thus, before we can proceed with the exegesis of his theoretical writings, we have to address the crucial issue of the "medium"--its nature, past utilization, and future potential. The medium of poetry, of course, is language. But which one? The ques- tion was paramount for the Russian avant-garde during the teens of the twentieth century. The object-grounded, referential words of the old mas- ters (Malevich would call them "technicians") were deemed incapable of expressing the raw emotions and spiritual aspirations of the new revolution- aries in art. As Kruchenykh and Khlebnikov proclaimed in their 1913 mani- festo Slovo kak takovoe [The Word as Such], language "should first of all be language; and if it is to remind one of anything, let it remind us of a saw or a poisoned arrow of a savage" (quoted in Markov 130). The problem with the old school of poetry was found to be that there had been too much preoccu- pation with "finish and polish" and not enough with "the word as such" (ibid.). The mission of the Futurist poet, by contrast, was to liberate the word from any connections with the objective world, which weigh it down and prevent it from soaring up to the universe of transrational experience. Zaum,14 the language of the budetlianskie rechetvortsy [futurist speech- makers] was deemed the only proper medium of artistic creation. Malevich agreed completely with his new friends (he met Kruchenykh and Khlebnikov during that same fateful year, 1913). In fact, he had al- ready used the word zaum to describe his own experimentations in paint- ing. In the catalogue for the fourth Union of Youth exhibition, which took part at the end of 1912, he had referred to his own works as zaumnyi realizm [transrational realism].15 His choice of words is certainly very inter- esting for several reasons. To begin with, it shows that he was familiar with the currently fashionable theoretical discourse. Secondly - and much more</page><page sequence="4">570 Slavic and East European Journal importantly - it proves that he was already trying to blur the boundaries separating painting and poetry, at least in the way people perceived and talked about them.16 Two years later, in 1914, paintings such as An English- man in Moscow (Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam), Composition with Mona Lisa (private collection, St. Petersburg), and Lady at the Advertising Col- umn (Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam) attempted something even more complex: the blending of mediums - the pictorial and the verbal - into one inseparable (if not necessarily coherent) whole. As Juliette Stapanian has noted, "except for its development by Kazimir Malevich into an aesthetics of Suprematism, pictorial zaum has been little studied" (19). If this manifestation of Malevich's utilization of zaum has been discussed at all, it has been in terms of its role in specific paintings, thus privileging its pictorial connections. It is possible, however, to view it also as an example of the artist's poetic experimentations with zaum - an approach that would allow us to include his "alogical" paintings among the poetic creations from the same period. I shall return to this point later. For now, let me go back to the phrase he used to describe his work in 1912, "zaumnyi realizm," in order to point out the implications that its second constituent member, realizm, has for a discussion of Malevich's art in all of its manifestations. Critics have suggested that rather than the product of bezumnyi [illogi- cal] sound combinations, zaum is "an art of abstraction that actively en- gages the idioms of traditional realism in a vigorous polemic or dialectic from which a new realism emerges" (Stapanian 18, emphases added). Whereas Symbolism had seen the word as less than its referent, and Acmeism had proposed a new system of correspondences, the Futurist zaum demanded that the word "straddle traditional semantic boundaries" (20). Malevich was correct, therefore, to present his own "alogical" paint- ings as examples of a new form of realism - radically innovative, but trans- rational nevertheless. The same holds true of his poetic creations from this period: as diverse as the poetry he produced during the 1910s and 1920s was, it always complied with such an understanding of zaum as "dynamic objectivism or realism of its own" (23). The similarity between his treatment of the two arts (that of painting and poetry), which, as I already suggested, is the product of Malevich's overall concern with the creative activity of the New Artist as a collective image, becomes obvious if we read his essays "From Cubism and Futurism to Suprematism. The New Realism in Painting" [1916]17 and "On Poetry" [1919] side by side. When reviewing the essay "From Cubism and Futurism to Suprematism," most Western critics (notably Simon Pugh and John Golding) agree that Malevich shares with Hegel a dialectical understanding of the origins and</page><page sequence="5">Malevich's Poetry: A "Wooden Bicycle ... Background of Masterpieces"? 571 subsequent history of artistic practices. All too easily, those critics translate Hegelian terminology into the language of the Suprematist thinker. Thus Hegel's three historical stages in the development of art (i.e. the Symbolic, Classical, and Romantic periods (635-38, 660-63, 684-85, 778-98)) are equated with the Suprematist's Savage/Collective Art, Classical/Aesthetic Art, and Intuitive Art. However, even if Malevich's theory of the evolution of artistic creation is certainly grounded in "historical dialectics," upon closer examination the comparison between the two thinkers fails to exhibit unproblematic similarities. Although Malevich does share with Hegel a mistrust of the phenomena of nature, and thus also condemns imitative representation from the moment of its emergence at the earliest stage in the history of art (i.e. Malevich's Collective Art indeed can be viewed as coincid- ing with Symbolic Art), the two philosophers' thought-paths diverge in their understanding of the second stage of artistic development. Whereas Hegel considers Classical Art to be the best form of art because of its alleged ability to recreate the (self-)conscious harmony between form and content in the three-dimensional (sculptural) depiction of the human body, Malevich actu- ally denounces the achievement of the highly aestheticized forms of Greek and Roman realism. The masters of Rome and Greece, Malevich claims "byli zadavleny esteticheskim vkusom, i realizm ikh byl opomazhen, opu- dren vkusom estetizma [were pressured by aesthetic sense, and their realism was pomaded and powdered by aesthetic sense]" (1995, 38; 1968, 22). The art products of the Renaissance and Romantic periods are just as flawed because of their heavy-handed "ornamentation and idealization" that al- ways lead to the ultimate "downfall of real art." Hegel's concern with the search for an art form with fewer and fewer material constraints (which, he claims, has been achieved in Romantic poetry, painting, and music) there- fore becomes prominent - and potentially viable - for Malevich only with the advent of Futurist and, somewhat counter-intuitively, Utilitarian Art.'8 There is really no equivalent in Hegel's scheme to Malevich's Intuitive Art.19 It is here that the Suprematist's theory of Art is at its most original: IIHTyHTHIBHOe, MHe Ka)KeTCqI, AOJIKHO BbIlIBHTC.S TaM, rAe c~OpMbI 6ecco3HaTeJIbHbl H 6e3 omeema.

I consider that it was necessary to understand the intuitive in art as the aim of our selective feeling towards objects. And it followed a purely conscious path, decisively forcing its way through the artist. It appears as two levels of consciousness fighting between themselves. (1968, 31; emphasis added)</page><page sequence="6">572 Slavic and East European Journal The passage is fascinating (if somewhat confusing) for two reasons. First, it defines intuitive art in relation to the material world and claims that its development was always actively "conscious," while at the same time pro- fessing its connection with the "unconscious" and its tendency toward monologic discourse which desires "no response." Second, it underscores the intrinsic tension between the "two levels of consciousness," which finds its expression in the creative, intuitive impulse.20 Intuition, then, is to be understood as the major prerequisite for artistic creation. As such, it has to be cultivated and studied by any serious practitioner of the new art in its various manifestations. Accordingly, the "intuitive" and its realization in literary forms and prac- tices become the main focus of Malevich's article "On Poetry." Before dis- cussing the ideas offered in the text, it is worth noting their peculiar styli- zation, as the vexed codification of human thoughts and feelings is at the center of not only of this, but of many other of Malevich's treatises on the nature of language. Throughout the essay the author draws attention to the artificiality of the linguistic material, underscoring its ultimate inability to transmit unequivocal information. His preferred trope is the "spatial" metaphor- e.g., poems are like "museums," "exhibit halls," "bars," "churches," and "pawn shops where neatly folded waistcoats, and cushions, carpets, trinkets, rings and silks, petticoats and carriages are packed away in rows of drawers, all according to a known order, law and basis" (1968, 77) - whose attempt to "ground" the comparison in neatly ordered lists only underscores the breach between signifier and signified in any semiotic sys- tem. Thus I would like to claim, along with Roman Jakobson21 and, more recently, Alexandra Shatskikh,22 that Malevich's critical essay offers an ex- ample of "metaphoric discourse" or poetic prose. In his analysis of Male- vich's style, Marcad6 offers the opposite view. The Suprematist's literary style, he claims, is "essentially metonymic, there is a perpetual substitution of terms designating cause and effect, the elements on the whole, the signi- fier and the signified" (239). Without a doubt, Malevich makes ample use of metonymy, synecdoche in particular, in his essays and letters. However, it is the abundance of original metaphors that marks all of the texts under discus- sion. Powerful vehicles of poetic expression, Malevich's many-layered, of- ten openly self-referential metaphors manage to achieve the effect of ostranenie [estrangement] which the Formalists so adamantly promoted, and thus to draw attention to the artificiality of the formal textual fabric of every piece of writing. As a theorist of literary discourse, Malevich always under- scores language's inability to express genuine sensations even partially (or metonymically, if you will) grounded in "reality." The Suprematist's choice of metaphor as his preferred trope of linguistic sdvig, therefore, is consistent with his larger theoretical project. The effect of defamiliarization is sought after from the very beginning of the article under consideration. "On Poetry" opens with two alternative</page><page sequence="7">Malevich's Poetry: A "Wooden Bicycle ... Background of Masterpieces"? 573 definitions of poetic discourse which immediately foreground the impossi- bility of providing stable criteria for its discussion:23 1. no33Hs, HeITO cTposaieecq Ha pHTMe H TeMne, H1JIH )Ke TeMII H pHTM nog6yaIoT noaTa K KOMn03HIAHH 4)OPM peaaIbHoro BHga. 2.

Poetry is something which builds upon rhythm and tempo, or rather it is tempo and rhythm which induce the poet to compose forms of a real appearance. 2. Poetry is the expression of form, subject to rhythm and tempo, and derived from the visible forms of nature and their emanations, which awaken our creative strength. (1968, 73). Deliberately confusing, repetitious, and vague as the definitions may be, their focus on the relationship between the art of poetry (i.e. its formal features) and the material world clearly announces the major concern for the following theoretical discussion. Much like the earlier essay, "From Cubism and Futurism to Suprematism," in "On Poetry" Malevich ap- proaches his subject in a diachronically delineated manner.24 Just as in the former his intention is to present a dialectical history of the development of art through the centuries, so in the latter he sets out to narrate briefly the peculiar story of the birth, nature, and goal of poetry through the ages. The teleological end of art, he claimed in "The New Realism in Painting," is announced by and realized in the objectlessness of Suprematist painting. Similarly, the goal of poetry is the destruction of any remnants of "realistic" poetic discourse, be it seen as "naturally derived" from the objective world, or necessarily expressed in the aestheticized, formal organization of the linguistic material. The three basic kinds of poetry25 which Malevich isolates in the essay, then, are both the result of a historical progression, and co-existing, ideologically loaded formats for the poet to choose from: EcTb aH033H5A, rAe no3T onncbiBaeT KJIOYOK npHpoEbI, nogrOHRq ero noA1 3aropeBUHHcicR B HeM pHTM, ecTb H033Ho1, rpe pHTM HgeT B yrogy 4QopMbI BeMIeHi.

(1995, 143) There is poetry in which the poet describes a natural fragment, pursuing it to the rhythm burning inside; there is poetry, in which the rhythm submits to the form of things. There is poetry in which the poet destroys objects for the sake of rhythm, leaving tattered scraps of form in unexpected confrontation. There is poetry in which pure rhythm and tempo remain as movement and time; here the rhythm and tempo rest on letters, which, like signs, contain this or that sound. (1968, 73) A year earlier, Malevich had come to similar conclusions in his "Zametki o poezii, dukhe, dushe, ritme, tempe" [Notes on poetry, spirit, soul, rhythm and tempo (1918)].26 This very little known essay is extremely helpful as a companion piece to "On Poetry" because of its much clearer elucidation of the same ideas, its consistency in the terminology used, and the explicit</page><page sequence="8">574 Slavic and East European Journal connections it makes between painting and poetry. In "Zametki," for in- stance, Malevich differentiates between Descriptive Academism (rhythm is imposed on the objects); Peredvizhnichestvo (the objects dominate the rhythm); Cubism (poetry that does away with the object for the sake of rhythm); Futurism (poetry is "chistyi ritm kak massa opiraiushchaiasia na bukvy, osvobozhdennye ot veshchi [pure rhythm as a mass dependent on letters which are free of any links to objective reality]"); and, finally, Suprematism as the highest achievement of Futurist poetry (118). In order to be able to reach the highest state of art, the poet "has to liberate himself, take reason apart and understand its order of things, feel the rhythm of the spirit [neobkhodimo razkrepostit' sebia, razorvat' razum i posmotret' v nem ego uklad veshchei i pochuiat' v dukhe ego ritm]" (122). Unfortunately, many artists are incapable of such revolutionary actions. Instead, they fall prey to the constricting demands of the old enemy of true creativity - technique, which is always "crude and mediocre" (1968, 76). Using completely unsuitable methods, the poet "falls into despair, and poems have become almost a rarity in which the poet does not weep, does not grieve over the impossibility of communicating what he wanted to say about nature, for he wanted to speak about nature and has instead spoken in the poem [...] through the clothes about clothes" (75). The pathological existence of the "poet-tailor" of the past and present, Male- vich claims, affects equally his work and his body, metamorphosizing him into "a terrible creature" with a "black throat" from which "word-things crawl: a stool, fragrant roses, women, graves and storm-clouds. It is like some kind of lizard, spewing things and swallowing them indiscriminately" (ibid.). What then is the alternative to this creature that seems to have crawled out of a painting by Hieronymus Bosch? Malevich's answer is to be found in the figure of the "new poet," or what he calls "the new Man-Form." There is one big difference between the melancholic27 poet-tailor and the "Man-Form" of the future: whereas the first can never transmit his feelings adequately through the conventional, highly formalized linguistic medium, the second manages to find the means of articulating his sorrow semi- otically. Thus, the successful poetic act consists of expressing oneself in sighs, screams, and other recognizable sounds of suffering. Finally, Male- vich is ready to share his highly poeticized vision of the true artist: 'oa3T eCT oco6a, KOTOpaS He 3HaeT ce6e noJo6HOil, He 3HaeT MacTepcTBa HJIH He 3HaeT KaK noBepHnerc ero Bor.

(2000, 145) A poet is a person who owns no like, knows no craft, nor does he know which way his God will turn. He is within himself, no matter what storm arises and disappears, whatever rhythm and</page><page sequence="9">Malevich's Poetry: A "Wooden Bicycle ... Background of Masterpieces"? 575 tempo it may bear. How can he think of polishing, sharpening and describing at the moment when the great fire arises in him? [...] The man-form is the same kind of sign as a note or letter, and no more. (1968, 76-77) This Man-Form is like a "super-terrestrial" who looks "into another world" (78). He, too, transforms himself into something different--a church, a priest--and by his actions "he awakens the spirit attendant on him in others; the awakening is successive, and the succession is mysterious and unfathomable, but real" (80). The mad liturgy that erupts out of that "body-sign" is markedly monologic. It preaches in the single voice of the initiated, never requiring or even expecting a response from the other. Interestingly enough, the monologic speech of the mad poet renders him into an Other as well: his words are just as inaccessible to him (i.e. to his brain) as they are to his audience. Thus the body-temple of the poet takes precedence over his mind - it is the passive yet necessary transmitter of the inspired language of the Spirit to whose meaning the poet has no rational access: CaMoe BbicIuee cqHiTaio MOMeHTbl cjnyzerHHs yxa H noara, roBop 6e3 cJIOB, Korga qepe3 poT 6eryT 6e3yMHbIe CJIOBa; 6e3yMHbie HH yMoM, HH pa3yMOM HenOCTilraeMbI. (2000, 149) I consider the highest moment in the poet's service of the spirit to be that of his wordless dialect, when demented words rush from his mouth, mad words accessible neither to the mind, nor to reason. (1968, 81) It is with the picture of the demented, Dionysian Man-Form that Male- vich chooses to end his essay on poetry. Once again, the visual and the audio-verbal come together in an attempt to create a powerful, poetic image of poetic practice itself. The poet's body takes on a life of its own, divorces its movements from consciousness - "When the flame within the poet flares up, he stands, raises his arms, and bends his body, producing that form which to the beholder will represent the real, new and living church" (81-82) - and begins to recite the subconscious, craftless poetry of the future: "Ule Elye Lel..." (82). It should have become clear by now that for Malevich art was a synthesis of sound, color, and rhythm. His is an overarching, all-inclusive theory of art, which remains consistently applied to whatever subject dominates his philosophical elaborations at a given moment in time: e.g., painting (as in 1915-16), or poetry (during 1918-19). Let us proceed, then, from the phylogeny of the poetic Man-Form according to Malevich-the-theoretician- of-modern-art, to the peculiar ontogeny of Malevich-the-poet, in order to explore the continuities and discrepancies between the two in practice. The Icon and the Axe Revisited: Malevich's Poetry Much like his paintings, at first glance Malevich's surviving poems seem to follow the evolution of his ideas about the development and function of</page><page sequence="10">576 Slavic and East European Journal art: they, too, appear to shed gradually the constraints of "primitive real- ism" in all of its manifestations (including Symbolism, Cubism and even Futurism) in order to achieve the objectless, weightless world of the Suprematist "Ule Elye Lel." However, just as it is difficult to date precisely some of the surviving paintings (because of Malevich's purposeful disre- gard for "historical" time), so it is doubtful whether we can ever study his poems in the exact chronological order in which they were created. If anything, the known dates for a number of texts suggest that the artist was able to produce thematically and formally diverse works during a very short time period. For example, the programmatic, philosophical poems of the "Liturgy Cycle" were written concurrently with the essay "On Poetry" and the zaumnoe "Ule Elye Lel." The proper periodization of his poetry is further complicated by the question of including certain painterly composi- tions among his poetic works. As was already suggested, it is often impossi- ble to discuss Malevich's verbal creations in isolation from his other artistic experiments (especially his paintings and drawings). In some cases the boundary between the two arts is blurred to an extent that makes it viable to treat certain pictures as poems and vice versa. That said, one can still differentiate three main periods (more or less in chronological order) within Malevich's poetic oeuvre, which comprise subgroups of thematically or linguistically comparable works. I have chosen to discuss them under three titles, taken from Malevich's own theory of art: Descriptive, Cubist, and Zaumnyi realizm. a. The "Descriptive" Poetic Works The first recorded samples of Malevich's poetic work come from a period which covers roughly six years, 1906-1912. Those texts--"Vsiakii vecher ugasnut luchi Solntsa..." [Every evening the Sun's rays will die out...], and a few others--have been named by Alexandra Shatskikh textual primitives (Malevich 2000, 10). The term clearly gestures toward the visual primitives the artist created at the beginning of his career under the influence of Larionov and Goncharova. And indeed, the connection between Male- vich's poetic practices and his painterly investigations is obvious from the very start. Much like paintings such as Otdykh. Obshchestvo v tsilindrakh [Relaxing. High Society in Top Hats, 1908] (State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg), and Pornograficheskoe obshchestvo v tsilindrakh [Porno- graphic High Society in Top Hats, 1907] (the Ludwig Museum, Kioln), his textual primitives consist of free, decorative verse whose "descriptive" qual- ity is counterbalanced by a playful, often sarcastic attitude toward the sub- ject matter.

(A casual summer, spent at the Romanov estate. 1906) In the painting, Malevich represents the cartoon-like, repetitive (in terms of color and form) figures of intoxicated aristocrats, randomly strewn against the background of a monochromatic green lawn, punctuated by equally cartoon-like flowers. Not just a "commentary on luxury and indo- lence" (Crone and Moos 59) but also a witty announcement of the inevita- ble "dying out" of a whole human breed, the painting provides a glimpse of a world of decadence in which people and objects have only decorative (or at best irrigating, if we are to judge by the urinating gentleman in the top left corner) value. The poem deals with the same subject in a strikingly similar manner. The repetition of the phrase "BC5IKii Bexep-b" signals the boredom and repetitiveness of life at an old landowner's estate. As in the painting, in the poem all nouns (animate and inanimate) are treated in the same way, moving between the positions of subjects and objects with an ease that suggests an intrinsic connection and essentially interchangeable utility. Gentlemen, ladies, and flowers decorate the lawn in Otdykh.</page><page sequence="12">578 Slavic and East European Journal Obshchestvo v tsilindrakh in equal measure. Similarly, carpets, glasses, women and men dot the landscape in the "idyllic" picture of an evening picnic in the poem. Time seems to stand still in both works--the same rituals of drinking, flirting, and coupling are rehearsed over and over again without relief on the level of semantics and imagery. On the level of gram- mar, however, "Vsiakii vecher..." goes even further than the painting in its implied sentence on the Russian petit bourgeois: the idea that their time has passed is embodied beautifully in the shift from the future, to the present, and, finally, to the past tense of the verbs. b. "Cubist" Poetic Experiments Malevich's serious poetic experimentations begin in 1913, when his col- laboration with poets like Khlebnikov and Khruchenykh leads to the birth of his absurdist poetry (e.g. "Skuchno popuasy..." [Boring Papuans...], etc.). The importance of this fateful year for Russian Futurism in general, and Malevich's artistic development in particular, cannot be overstressed. In July of the "annus mirabilis" (Markov 132) Matiushin invited Malevich to participate in the production of the first truly Futurist opera for the St. Petersburg Union of Youth. For three days, July 18-20 (July 31-August 2), the composer, the artist, and their friend, the poet Kruchenykh, worked together at Matiushin's dacha in Uusikirkko, Finland, on the creation of what was to be known as the opera Victory Over the Sun. Their meeting, which they referred to as the "First All-Russian Congress of the Poets of the Future," also resulted in a manifesto that announced their intention to revo- lutionize the last "stronghold of artistic weakness," the Russian theater, as a synthesis of all arts. The manifesto is the first published Futurist document that bears Malevich's signature. Malevich designed the sets and the costumes for the opera in a pure abstract style which was praised for its ability to reach a true transrational effect - something that certain perceptive spectators felt Kruchenykh failed to achieve in the text.29 However, even if the artist's "zaum of painting [...] had maximum organization of material, tension, will-power, nothing fortu- itous" (Lifshits 164), his poetry from the same time shares a lot of the problems of Kruchenykh's libretto: it, too, seems to be marked by "chaos, lack of discipline, caprice, epileptic convulsions" (ibid.). Absurdist (rather than transrational) works such a "Skuchno popuasy" impose rhythm on collections of loosely linked nouns (all of which are in the nominative case) in a word play based on skillful sound and root alter- ations and repetitions. As Shatskikh notes in her introduction to Poeziia, the text of the poem "Skuchno popuasy..." is "bezsmyslennyi [illogical]," but "udivitel'nym obrazom 'predmetnyi' i 'peizazhnyi"' [surprisingly 'objec- tive' and 'scenic']" (11). And if such descriptive qualities relate the poem to the earlier comic subplots of works like "Vsiakii vecher," certain motifs</page><page sequence="13">Malevich's Poetry: A "Wooden Bicycle ...

"Zaumnyi Realizm" and Malevich's Poetry The third period (1914-1919) of Malevich's poetic experimentation is by far the most complex and interesting. There are two, very different, groups of works which were created at the same time. The first group comprises a) textual zaum included in paintings such as An Englishman in Moscow, 1914 (Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam), Composition with Mona Lisa, 1914 (Pri- vate Collection, St. Petersburg), Lady at the Advertising Column, 1914 (Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam); b) "prografachniki"; and c) zaum poetry proper (e.g. "1I io MaHe TOpb- peTH KOCT-b TeoHy," 1914; "Kop pe peMMH He KOH," 1914; "Ule Elye Lel," 1919). The second group consists of the poems from the so-called "Nature Cycle" and "Liturgy Cycle," and the rhythmical prose of the articles published in the newspaper Anarkhiia [An- archy] during March and April of 1918. The space of this paper does not allow me to give these works the appropriate critical attention each one of them deserves. Thus I will focus briefly only on one representative example from each subgroup, with the hope that, even if limited, my illustrations will provide enough information to sustain the factual and theoretical framework I have tried to delineate here. The mixed - linguistic and painterly - medium of works such as An En- glishman in Moscow, Aviator, Composition with Mona Lisa, and Lady at the Advertising Column has been discussed by many art critics31 on both sides of the ocean. Several scholars have commented on the apparent relationship between these paintings and the poetic theory and practice of Kruchenykh and Khlebnikov. For example, Charlotte Douglas points out the "curious coincidence of Kruchenykh's terms and Malevich's images" in Kruchenykh's vision of language as "a saw or the poisoned arrow of a</page><page sequence="14">580 Slavic and East European Journal savage." She continues: "There is also little or no narrative cohesion in a work; unrelated and incongruous images simply turn the mind back on itself until interpretation is abandoned" (1975, 363-64). Although such an approach to the paintings is quite adequate if one is to look for "narrative cohesion" in them, it is not the only possible way of exploring the intrica- cies of the individual works. As Simmons has suggested, with paintings such as An Englishman in Moscow and Aviator, Malevich tried to go be- yond the limits of synthetic Cubism in order to "find the higher laws," and "to submit to deeper analysis the psychological structures of the archetype of wholeness, the image of God" (168-69). The peculiar logic behind such philosophical investigations and the methods of their artistic representation have much in common with the abstract flights of thought behind zaumnyi realism. As we already discussed, the shifts and conflations of different interpretative scenarios carried by the transrational work of art answer to a logic of their own, but a logic nevertheless. Let us explore at some length the example of An Englishman in Moscow (fig. 1) in order to address the question of the possibility of establishing meaningful correlations between words and images, language and painting. The painting presents a bisected image of a man in a top hat (the "En- glishman") depicted among numerous objects of various sizes and space- orientation. The "portrait" immediately establishes connections with ear- lier works. As in the Aviator, center stage is occupied by a human head and torso, with a white sturgeon (a traditional symbol of Christ in the Russian Orthodox religion) concealing the left half of the man's face. The right eye is left uncovered, staring intently at the viewer without any intention of disclosing the hidden secrets behind its surface. A correlation with the Portrait of Ivan Kliun, 1913 (State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg) under- scores this particular formal feature of the painting: in the earlier work, the left eye of the figure is removed completely, while the right is replaced by an opening in the skull that reveals the inner workings of the brain. The "Englishman" offers no such access to the internal images accompanying the psychic process. Instead, it externalizes human perception, underscor- ing by the clutter of objects and words around the human figure the impossi- bility of judging their interconnectedness and value according to standard conscious logic. The visual signs, then, comply with an alogical system of values which remains outside the laws of a single perspectival space. The array of images is striking in its apparent randomness and disorder: a lit candle placed in front of the fish and the left side of the face illuminates and bathes them in white and yellow tones; a church dangles over a ladder whose lower part connects it with three bayonets; a sword cuts the painting diagonally; open scissors appear in the right side of the picture under a huge saw; and a little higher and to the left, a big red spoon (the famous symbol of the Russian Futurists) dangles in the air. Yet, slowly, an inner</page><page sequence="15">i": .... i  ' I' ? : . ..? :;i ?j~6 ,,.i Fig. 1: An Englishman in Moscow (1914, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam)</page><page sequence="16">582 Slavic and East European Journal rhythm begins to emerge, organizing the objects in meaningful (even if unstable) combinations. The painting appears to be divided--both verti- cally and horizontally - into halves comprised of repeated motifs that often carry inverted values. The iconic symbols (the sturgeon, the lit candle, the church, the ladder) in the left section imply a structural organization that on one level stages the surface interactions as a struggle between Christ and Antichrist. (The divided nature of the human soul is a favorite topic for Malevich in the poems of the Liturgy Cycle that he was creating during the same period.) The painting does not resolve the tensions but simply brings them to the surface. The process is most evident in the formal repetitions that link incongruent imagery: the flanks of the fish are echoed in the curves of the man's mouth and the teeth of the saw; the sword aiming upwards and to the left is mirrored by the red arrow pointing downwards and to the right; the contours of the candle coincide with the shape of the wooden spoon (the similarity between the two further strengthened by the yellow rays of light appearing behind the red spoon); the cross is suggested several times (in the crossed images of the sword and the candle, the sword and the ladder, the sword and the fish). The play between the painterly images could be continued for quite a while before the interpretive possibilities would be exhausted completely. An icon of modern man, a portrait of an artist, a god-like figure, a symbol of the Antichrist, a local poet carrying a wooden spoon as a sword, and a foreign, disoriented intruder into the native culture --all of these interpretations exist simultaneously, equally valid, unfinalizable. The confusion of painterly associations is enhanced even further by the presence of phrases, words, and letters broken into segments and strewn over the canvas's surface in a manner that connects them with the hand- made poetic collections of Futurist writers like Khlebnikov, Kruchenykh, and others. Starting from the top, the painted zaum poem reads as follows: 3A TMEHIE CKAKOBOE OBIAIECTBO qAC THI4 HOE ZA TMENIE SKAKOVOE OBSHCHESTVO CHAS TICH NOE There is no obvious, referential correspondence between the words and the images. Yet a connection between them exists in terms of their function within the work as a whole. Let us consider, for example, Malevich's play with the possible meanings of the inscribed semantic units - both in their totality and as fragments--in relation to the painting's central thematic</page><page sequence="17">Malevich's Poetry: A "Wooden Bicycle... Background of Masterpieces"? 583 concerns rehearsed by the presented imagery. Thus, the usual understand- ing of ZA/TMENIE as "eclipse" is undermined by the division in the word into two parts, which suggests the idea that it can be read as being "for / darkness." SKAKOVOE OBSHCHESTVO [a racing society] cuts through the logically connected "eclipse" and "partial" [CHASTICHNOE], thus verbally repeating the implied function of the painted sword. As with its painterly equivalent, the phrase "racing society" bonds not only with the image of the fashionable "Englishman" and his "elegant" lifestyle, but also with contemporary fascination with speed --an acceleration of human move- ment and experiences that is definitely positive from a Futurist point of view. The preoccupation with time and its modern value is continued in the first of the three segments of the broken word CHAS/TICH/NOE [partial]: "chas" means "hour," a unit of time measurement. Simultaneously, the "T" at the beginning of the next syllable, TICH, is repeated and aggrandized in the outline of the crossed sword and the candle, thus turning the previous word portion, "CHAS" into "CHAST" [part]. The idea of a part of a whole is next expanded by the notion of "possession," when that same pictorial "T" is used to combine "CHAS" with "NOE" into "CHASTNOE" [private] - a possibility underscored also by the same color, black, used to draw the last and the first letter of the displaced syllables. The motif of "privateness" once again relates the text to the idea of the bourgeois Englishman's life- style, while at the same time suggesting a very different commentary on the act of perceiving as an implied judgment on impressions and feelings that are essentially private and sacred. The zaum poems of Malevich's "alogical" paintings find their flipside in the experimental works from the second sub-group under the heading of "zaumnyi realizm": the so-called "prografachniki."32 These mixed-media drawings such as gepe6en [Village] (2000, 19), EYPM... OJIOC, HoAembl Hepy [Flights for Peru], and KolueAeK 6btbmau4uau 6 mpam6ae [A Wallet Was Stolen in the Tram] (ibid. 16) challenge the mimetic function of repre- sentation in even more strikingly innovative, minimalist forms of expres- sion than the paintings. Just as the introduction of letters/words into the paintings combats the solely visual perception of the painted canvas as a "window on reality," thus allowing for a new, textual interpretation of their flat surfaces, so do the imposed frames on his prografachniki open up the possibility for the visual (painterly) experience and critical investigation of the poems. In this sense, they present a much more interesting example of Malevich's struggle to overcome the traditional constraints of both the visual and the verbal arts than his imitative "zaum" proper. Poems such as "H Io MaHe TOp'b peTH KOCT'b TeoHy," "Kop pe pe)KMH He KOH," and "Ule Elye Lel" do not go beyond the linguistic experiments of the master- budetliane Kruchenykh and Khlebnikov.</page><page sequence="18">584 Slavic and East European Journal Concurrently with the creation of the works from the first major group of writing from the 1914-1919 period, Malevich produced two poetic "cycles" - namely, the so-called Nature cycle ("Priroda" [Nature], "Drova privezli" [The Firewood Is Here], "Pochemu iz sklepa seredine moei" [Why from the crypt of my heart]; and the Liturgical cycle33 ("Ia nachalo vsego" [I am the beginning of everything], "Mir neobiatnaia tselostnost"' [The World is an unfinalizable wholeness], "Usta Zemli i Khudozhnik" [The Earth's Mouth and the Artist], "Khudozhnik" [The Artist]34) - whose origi- nality lies not so much in the surface experimentation with linguistic and/or painterly material, but in the fascinating depth of the explored philosophi- cal ideas. The influence of their rhythmical, mystical poetic language (which has borrowed much from the rhetoric of the Old and the New Testament) is so overpowering that it spills over into Malevich's contempo- raneous critical prose, as can be gleaned not only from analysis of essays such as "On Poetry," but also from reading the series of articles for Anarkhiia (e.g. "K novoi grani" [Towards a New Limit], "Ia prishel" [I came], "Otvechaia staromu dniu" [Responding to the old days], etc.).35 Let us consider briefly an example from each of the "cycles": "Drova privezli," from the Nature cycle, and "Usta Zemli i Khudozhnik," from the Liturgical series. The theme of the poem "Drova privezli"36 is a familiar one: Man versus Nature. It has been present in the Russian poetic tradition from the very first odes of Lomonosov and Derzhavin. It had certainly dominated the works of the Romantics, and had been revisited by the Symbolists. So how is Malevich's approach to an old topic different, or even interesting? The poem's beginning announces a state of war: men go to the woods armed with their best weapons. The first of many operative oppositions has been put in motion; that much is clear. In fact, one soon realizes, the poem as a whole is based on a number of binary oppositions (semantic, grammati- cal), whose members keep shifting, changing allegiances, so to speak. The lack of stable reference to a clear "positive" term in the pairs deliberately confuses the reader, destabilizing his/her sense of "knowing" or "under- standing" what the poem is about. At first the fairly straightforward, al- most prosaic narration clearly delineates the two fighting camps: men (civi- lization) and the forest (Nature): B3sJIH naHbl Tonoplb BepeBKH, H IIouIIIH BOAHOIO Ha neca.

They left, their clothes fastened most tightly, Then, once there, let loose and undressed and measured the forest's body. They marked the oldest ones And silently approached a tree and started Sawing at its very fingers-roots. In a dramatic, mythical turn of the story (a typical sdvig), a single repre- sentative is "elected" on both sides: the threatening advent of a solitary man to his victim is mirrored by the individuation of the lonely, yet "natu- rally" powerful tree. Here the textual camera provides us with a close-up of the anthropomorphic tree (it has a body, fingers; it is capable of feelings and thought), developing an account of its past and present feelings and hopes over the following nine lines. The change in mood is reflected also in the aspectual verbal shift: whereas so far the narration has been carried on with predominantly perfective verb forms, now that the focus is on the prolonged suffering of the tree, the aspect turns to imperfective. The point of view is unquestionably that of a victim, whose cruel fate we are invited to commiserate with: Moeria nepeHocHRio gepeBO 6on cBsoI, H cMorpenio B CHHHfI npocrop.

Silently, the tree bore Its pain and stared in the blue space. It had hopes for its twigs and roots. It thought no one could uproot it from the earth. The branches would withstand the gravest storms And would protect the trunk. To this end it gave birth to more And more twigs every year. It kept expecting storms, and in preparation, its roots had sunk deeply. Then, again, the tone of the narration drastically changes, and we are forced to shake off the Romantic stupor that has paralyzed our critical judgment of the situation so far: the tree turns out to be much more useful to mankind in its new, utilized forms as shelter, fire and field nourishment. Not surprisingly for the man who co-authored the Futuristic opera Victory Over the Sun, the "victory over the tree" is hailed as a sign of progress and</page><page sequence="20">586 Slavic and East European Journal greeted with optimistic cheer. Much like the reader, the lyrical hero is awakened from his Wordsworthian reminiscences by the loud cry of the victorious Future: "The Firewood Is Here!" He quickly joins in the celebra- tion by taking over the axe, and continuing with the destruction of the object-symbol of Nature: B31JI Tonop KOJnyH H 3TH KYCKHI po6nn, KyCKH euie 60poJIHcb Aep)KanH KpenKO TenIo CBOe He xoTeJH 6e3 6oI cAaBaTb HH KycKa.

I grabbed the axe and began hacking up the pieces, which put up a fight Held on to their body, did not want to surrender a single piece without a battle. But my hands drove in harder and further The iron axe and the log burst into splinters So proud of my victory I entered my house Warmed up by the tree. This is what the Suprematist artist's manifestoes had argued for: the ultimate erasure of all subject-object relationships. In a world of "ob- jectlessness," all signs become divorced from their signifiers, undergo a process of self-mutilation and fragmentation. In a brilliant move, Malevich signals the final disintegration of all the parties involved: the tree unwill- ingly bursts into splinters, while the man's body shrinks to the broken, metonymic representation of two hands holding an iron axe. The Prome- thean nature of the Artist cum Axe37 - a destroyer of old, and creator of new forms of expression--is clearly signaled by the last image offered by the text: the tree has been turned into a warming fire, and successfully utilized for the good of mankind. The theme of the role of the Artist in the creation of modernity is prevalent in all of the poems from the Liturgical cycle. Essentially, they present the ideas we are already familiar with from Malevich's theoretical writings, in a new, lyrical form. As such, they should be studied alongside the texts of articles such as "On Poetry" and "From Cubism and Futurism to Suprematism." For example, in "Usta Zemli i Khudozhnik"38 the author begins with the usual survey of the past history of art forms, critiques their "pagan" nature, and finally offers his enlightened Futurist alternative. His final appeal to his fellow budetliane demands that they utilize the liberating power of color and numbers in order to win the final victory over the secretive Earth (echoes from Khlebnikov's theory of the importance of numbers for understanding history become clearly audible): "6ybTre TOJIbKO Boopy~)KeHbI 9HCJIOM H BeTOM H no6ega 3a BaMH [be armed only with numbers and colors and the victory will be yours]" (77).</page><page sequence="21">Malevich's Poetry: A "Wooden Bicycle ... Background of Masterpieces"? 587 As in "Drova privezli," the poet disappears in the end - along with his "word" [slovo]--as the world of Suprematist objectlessness imposes its main constituent elements, color, numbers, and sound, on everything: B 3TOM nameM yxoee MbI yBIAIM MejibKOM Hagrpo6HbIII II aMTHHK no3Ty Ha Tpyn ero ciAeT CJIOBO H o6a H3ne3HyT. IlBeT H MHCJaa H 3ByK IpaBsT MIHpOM. In our retreat we'll see fleetingly the tombstone of the poet on his corpse the word will sit and both will disappear. Color and numbers and sound rule the world. This is the final goal of artistic creativity as the Suprematist thinker understood it: a participation in the silent wisdom of the cosmos. Having reached the ultimate creative expression, the poet-Man-Form willingly lapses into the supreme economy of silence that expects and demands no response. Significantly, Malevich's last existing poem (mid 1920s) encodes this idea with the minimalist beauty of a Futurist haiku: eienb My3bIKH MojnaHHe (112) music's goal is silence I began this essay with two quotes from Malevich's writing. The first raised a question (Are his verbal creations "adequate" in comparison with acknowledged masterpieces or not?), which I tried to approach with exam- ples from the author's various works. The second--the passage from the poem "Khudozhnik"--already anticipated the final answer. All an artist can and should do is "talk about himself," as nobody really knows how others "imagine the world." Malevich succeeded in transmitting his fantas- tic, Suprematist vision not only through his paintings, but also through his poetic creations. His poetry certainly stands out against any background. And if it were to take the shape of a "wooden bicycle" at all, it would do that with the pride and power of a zaumnyi red spoon thrown in the face of public taste as a weapon. NOTES This paper was originally part of a forum organized by Nikita Nankov on the intersection of the verbal and the visual in the Russian avant-garde. I would like to thank Alexandra Shatskikh, Sidney Monas, Leslie O'Bell, Anna Yatsenko, Nikita Nankov, Gerald Janecek and</page><page sequence="22">588 Slavic and East European Journal the two anonymous reviewers for reading earlier drafts of this paper, and for their useful suggestions. 1 This excerpt is taken from a letter to Gershenzon, printed in Malevich 1995, 3: 343-45. The letter was originally published by Irina Men'shova as "K. S. Malevich. Pis'mo k Gershenzonu (1920). Eksperiment." The translation in English is as follows: In everything that is written about me people always insult me, belittle me, but in conversations I get the impression that if they are not imitators themselves, they are not too far from it. What I am missing, though, is the most important thing - I don't have a mirror in which I could see myself; to this moment I don't know what I am writing, if it is any good, if there is anything in it, or it all happens to be a wooden bicycle against the background of masterpieces. All translations from Russian, unless otherwise noted, are by the author. 2 This excerpt is taken from Malevich 2000, 108. The English translation follows: I imagine worlds of inexhaustible invisible forms From the invisible for me the endless world is made I'll talk about myself since I don't know how everything in nature pictures the world. 3 In December 1915 Malevich presented thirty-nine non-representational works at the second Futurist exhibition in Petrograd, 0.10. Among those, cataloged as #39 is the "Chetyrekhugol'nik" [Quadrilateral] better known as the "Black Square." The word "Suprematism" appears on the wall of his installation for the first time. It is also used to describe this newest development in art in a brochure written by Malevich, called "From Cubism to Suprematism in Art, to the new Realism of Painting, to Absolute Creation." 4 The acronym UNOVIS stands for "Affirmation of the New Art." This was Malevich's program at the Popular Art Institute in Vitebsk, which aimed at preparing students to create (collectively) art forms on the basis of Suprematism. 5 The retrospective, titled K. S. Malevich. One-Person Exhibition. His Way from Impres- sionism to Suprematism opened in January 1920 in Moscow. 6 The famous Poshchechina obshchestvennomu vkusu [A Slap in the Face of Public Taste], published in Moscow in 1912, appealed to the new artist to "throw overboard from the Ship of Modernity" not only Russian Classics like Pushkin, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, etc., but also Symbolists and Realists such as Maxim Gorky, Kuprin, Sologub, Remizov, Averchenko, Cherny, Kuzmin, Bunin, etc. Malevich fully subscribed to the ideas es- poused by Burliuk, Kruchenykh, Mayakovsky, and Khlebnikov. See Lawton 51. 7 As a fundamental element in pictorial Cubism, the term sdvig was discussed by David Burliuk as early as 1912 in his essay "Cubism." See Poshchechina 95-110. 8 A survey of the correspondence between Malevich and Gershenzon from the 1920s shows that Malevich needed Gershenzon's constant validation and encouragement, and used him as a sounding-board for all of the theoretical articles he created during this period. See, for instance, letters 4 (Nov. 18, 1919), 5 (Dec. 21, 1919), 7 (April 11, 1920), 9 (Jan. 1, 1921) in Malevich 1995, 331-38, 340-42, 345-46. 9 Another, much more "technical" problem could have also contributed to Malevich's anxiety about the quality of his writing: Russian was not his first language (he was born in Kiev, and his parents were of Polish descent so he learned Ukrainian and Polish first). In addition, his formal education was very limited, and his disregard for traditional syntax and grammar often made him the "target for better educated critics" (Andersen, "Pref- ace" in Malevich 1968, 1: 7). 10 The article was first published in the journal Izobrazitel'noe iskusstvo [Painting] No 1, Petrograd, 1919.</page><page sequence="23">Malevich's Poetry: A "Wooden Bicycle ... Background of Masterpieces"? 589 11 The term budetliane, as is well known, was coined by the "Father" of Russian zaum, Velimir Khlebnikov. In "Truba Marsian" [The Marsians' Trumpet] he described the actions of this new race thus: "a transman [zachelovek] wearing a carpenter's apron saws time into boards and handles his tomorrow in the manner of a lathe operator" (in Markov 304). 12 Apparently, Kruchenykh thought highly enough of Malevich's poetic talent to include him among the eight primary practitioners of zaum in his 1918 "eulogy to zaum" (Bowlt 185). 13 Shatskikh's compilation (Malevich 2000) is the most comprehensive collection of Male- vich's poetic works. Some of the poems included in it are known to the Western reader from the pioneering translations in Malevich 1978. 14 Kruchenykh is credited with the introduction of zaum with the three short poems that opened his 1913 book Pomada [Pomade]. The book, illustrated by Larionov, became the classic example of a Futurist publication. 15 See D'Andrea 8. The exhibited works display "metallic," cone-shaped, denaturalized forms. 16 Of course, Malevich was not alone in this "linguistic-pictorial game" (Bowlt 182). Other artists - notably Goncharova, Rozanova, Kruchenykh and Zdanevich - had already pub- licized their experimentations with zvukopis' [sound-painting]. Yet they were coming from the opposite direction: they were trying to use sounds to create a verbal painting. Malevich, on the other hand, used painting to create poetry. 17 The article "Ot kubizma i futurizma k suprematizmu. Novyi zhivopisnyi realizm" [From Cubism and Futurism to Suprematism. The New Realism in Painting] was published as a separate booklet in Moscow 1916. Basically, it was an expanded version of the manifesto Ot kubizma k suprematizmu. Novyi zhivopisnyi realizm [From Cubism to Suprematism. The New Realism in Painting], which was issued at the time of the "Last Futurist Exhibit 0.10" (1915). Matiushin had sponsored this earlier publication. Malevich continued to revise and expand his ideas about the history and development of art throughout his life. In 1919, right after his relocation to Vitebsk, he returned to the 1916 article with the result being a book called On New Systems in Art. It remains, as Troels Andersen puts it, his "main work from the period" ("Malevich on New Art," in Malevich 1968, 1: 9). 18 It is helpful here to note, along with Jean-Claude Marcad6 (231), that Malevich uses the word "utilitarian" in two opposing senses: a negative one, which designates the work and philosophy of his productionist adversaries (i.e. Tatlin and Rodchenko), and a positive one, which denotes the "purely utilitarian perfection of Suprematism" that helps "the being appear." It is in the second meaning that the term appears in Malevich's interpreta- tion of Classical/Aesthetic Art. 19 As Andersen notes in "Malevich on New Art," Malevich's treatment of "intuition" is probably derived from the Italian Futurist Boccioni's ideas on its role in artistic creation. The painting, Boccioni claimed, "becomes an architectonic of construction, irradiating, in which the artist, and not the object, forms the central core" (12). Thus, it is the intuitive work of the artist that assists the emergence of true Futurist creation. Malevich took this viewpoint to its absolute limits, turning it into yet another attack upon conven- tional logic. 20 It is worth noting here that in his understanding of the creative process as a struggle between "two levels of consciousness," Malevich was once again very much ahead of his time. It was only in the 1960s and 1970s, with the advent of Lacanian psychoanalysis and French post-structuralist theoretical constructs such as those formulated by Julia Kristeva, that the struggle between the subconscious semiotic and the conscious symbolic drives was identified as being at the heart of the artistic process.</page><page sequence="24">590 Slavic and East European Journal 21 See, for example, Jakobson's "Two Aspects of Language and Two Types of Aphasic Disturbances" and his later work Language in Literature. 22 See Shatskikh's introduction to Kazimir Malevich. Poeziia, especially 9-21 (Malevich 2000). 23 Malevich's permanent tendency toward shifts of meaning and play with pre-existing artistic models is especially clear when we consider the opening of "On Poetry" in relation to the beginning of Kruchenykh and Khlebnikov's manifesto The Word as Such (for which Malevich had contributed a number of illustrations). The earlier text, let us recall, had begun by underscoring the dual nature of poetic discourse, which resulted in two types of poetry: the first was to "be written and perceived in the twinkling of an eye! (singing, splashing, dancing, scattering of clumsy constructions, oblivion, unlearning" (in Lawton 57); the second was characterized as being "written tightly and read tightly, more uncomfortable than blacked boots or a truck in the living room" (ibid.). Malevich bor- rows the organization principle of Kruchenykh and Khlebnikov's primary division, but proceeds to translate it into the transrational logic of his own two definitions. 24 As Charlotte Douglas has noted, in his dialectical history of art forms Malevich comes closest to the Cubo-Futurists (and A. Kruchenykh in particular, as the latter's manifesto New Ways of the Word testifies to), who argued that "the evolution of the psyche over time accounted for the succession of styles in art, especially the newest painting styles" (Douglas 1991, 58). 25 By the time of the essay's publication, Malevich had already been thinking about possible classifications of poetry for several years. For instance, in a letter to Matiushin from June 1916 he offers the following, strikingly similar, categorization: 1) thoughts about objects: "the poet strung together letters in order to form words which signified this or that object." This poetry he calls "descriptive" (2000, 116). 2) new struggle with thoughts: the new poets "tried to bring the letter closer to the idea of the sound (not music) [pytalis' bukvu priblizit' k idee zvuka (ne muzyki)]" (ibid.) This kind of poetry is related to religious ecstasy, the nervous system, Khlysty [Flagel- lants]. The "word as such has to be transformed into something else [slovo kak takovoe dolzhno byt' perevoplashcheno vo chto to]," but it will remain "dark" (ibid.). "Rational or transrational - it doesn't matter. They are close to one another, equally strong--they are two poles. But the task of the poetry-letter is to leave those two poles behind, and find itself" (117). His solution is the "note-letter" (which, he insists, is not the same as the musical note). 3) The third case has "the mass of the note-letters distributed in space as in Suprematism [raspredelenie bukvenykh zvukovykh mass v prostranstve podobno zhivopisnomu suprematizmu]" (117). 26 "Zametki o poezii, dukhe, dushe, ritme, tempe" is published for the first time in Male- vich 2000, 118-24. The text of the article is based on manuscript notes held in the Khardzhiev Archive, Chagi, Amsterdam. 27 Here, once again, Malevich's "medical" examinations of the pathology of the creative process appear to be a striking precursor of Julia Kristeva's ideas about the nature and psychological effects of artistic practice, developed most fully in Black Sun: Depression and Melancholia. Language's failure to "symbolize" objective reality in any meaningful way for the poet, Malevich and Kristeva argue in accord, threatens the very existence of individual subjectivity. Melancholia, and its temporary version, depression, entail a destabilization of the symbolic "I" with its pre-programmed use of signs: for the affected, melancholic artist, language can never be "natural," "maternal," but is always going to be "foreign," turning the speaking subject himself into a "foreign," monster-like creature in the process.</page><page sequence="25">Malevich's Poetry: A "Wooden Bicycle ... Background of Masterpieces"? 591 28 The original of "Vsiakii vecher" is kept in a private archive in Moscow. 29 For a discussion of the Luna Park Theater productions of Victory Over the Sun, see Lifshits 160-64. 30 The poem "Skuchno popuasy" was first published by Khardzhiev in Literatura posle. zhivopisi (8). The text quoted here is taken from Kazimir Malevich. Poeziia, and is based on the original manuscript kept in a private collection in Moscow. There are several differences between this version and Khardzhiev's text, but it is very likely that the inconsistencies in the latter are simply due to misprints. 31 See, for example, Bowlt; Gray 134-36; Simmons 167-205; Crone and Moos 63-110. 32 The term - one of many striking neologisms coined by Malevich himself--is singled out and used in relation to the artist's mixed-media creations from that period (1912-1914) by Shatskikh in her introduction to Poeziia 16-20. 33 The name "Liturgical cycle" is offered by Shatskikh in her introduction to Poeziia. Another possible phrase to describe the poetry from this particular subgroup could be borrowed from El Lissitzky, who catalogued these poems under the heading "intuitivnaia zapis' [intuitive writing]" in 1919 (Malevich 2000, 21). I prefer Shatskikh's terminology to Lissitzky's, because of its obvious reference to the thematic concerns, and the biblical orchestration of the linguistic material typical of these texts. 34 Although written later (1919-1920 in Vitebsk), thematically and stylistically the poem "Khudozhnik" belongs with the rest of the works from the Liturgy cycle. It deserves to be noted that it was perhaps the only one of his poetical works to be read out loud by the author at an evening of UNOVIS (Affirmation of the New Art) which took place on Sept. 17, 1921 (Malevich 2000, 24). 35 They were reprinted in 1919 in Iskusstvo kommuny [Art of the Commune], Petrograd, on the initiative of Narkompros [People's Commissariat for Enlightenment], and with Maya- kovsky's support. 36 The text of this poem was published for the first time in Kazimir Malevich. Poeziia and is based on a copy from a private collection. The poem was most likely written in 1917. 37 For the significance of the image of the "axe" in Russian culture, see Billington's The Icon and the Axe, especially 26-37. Malevich's treatment of the axe as a symbol of necessary destruction and progress is very similar to Walt Whitman's interpretation of the same topic in his poem "Song of the Broad-Axe." Although we cannot be sure of it, it is possible that Malevich had read this work (Whitman's translated verse was extremely popular with the Futurists), and had been influenced by it in one way or another. 38 The poem "Usta Zemli i Khudozhnik" is also printed for the first time in Poeziia. Its text is based upon a manuscript kept in the Khardzhiev Archive at Chagi, Amsterdam. There is evidence that it was intended for publication in Supremus; unfortunately, the journal never saw print. The poem was most likely written in 1916-17. REFERENCES Andersen, Troels, ed. "Malevich on New Art." Preface. K. S. Malevich. Essays on Art 1915- 1933. Vol. 1. By Kazimir Malevich. Trans.
