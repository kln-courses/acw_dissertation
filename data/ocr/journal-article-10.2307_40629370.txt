<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOHN BERRY The Hot Homage There was a light-to-moderate drizzle growing heavier, with fewer bright periods, as predicted, still he preferred to walk home from work. It wasn't far, it was his only exercise and it perturbed him less than did riding in the London traffic. Colds and fevers didn't bother him anyway - he shook them off promptly at the office. They were immediately soaked up by uncomplaining junior editors at the publishing house which he dominated. Damon Güster was a robust man in his early sixties, who looked more like the businessman he was than like the poet he also was; but he was a poet, as they said, "of distinction," and had been so for a long time. He had five volumes of verse to his credit, none of them published by his firm. The latest one had come out only the year before. There were no bad notices. At the usual crossing, he bought his copy of the Times. It contained a message which he absorbed deeply at a glance. The lights changed, he crossed over. As he walked, he removed his hat. The rain darkened his graying hair and trickled down his face. Except for the red eyes, there was little indication that he was weeping. Tristan Wrye: Stricken. In hospital, not expected to last through the night. Always in frail health, failing rapidly to- wards the end. Lived modestly on small pension from Society of Authors. No one in the block of flats where he lived realized Krishna Fluting (Macmillan), John Berry's first novel, was a Book-of-the-Month Club edition and won the first Macmillan Fiction Award. Two of his short stories were included in Martha Foley's Best Short Stories and Flight of White Crows: Stories, Tales, and Paradoxes (Macmillan) was on the New York Times Recommended List for eight weeks. His poems have been published in Poetry, the Nation, and other magazines, and his awards include a Guggenheim Fellowship, Fulbright Grant in India to write fiction, and many others. 95</page><page sequence="2">PRAIRIE SCHOONER that the shabby old man had already gone down in history as one of the chief glories of English Literature in the first third, say, of the Twentieth Century. Tristan Wrye! Scholars wrote dissertations on him. Anthologies ended with him. The last of his kind, almost. A shameful thing and not uncommon - the world had learned nothing, nothing! A living monument of the human spirit, neglected, forgotton, reduced to living on a few shillings a week! There had been that overwhelming surge of poems during his twenties. Grandeur, purity, lines that some people at least thought were immortal. Then he was burnt out. Of the great flame, not a spark was left. After his twenty-sixth year, he had published nothing. People waited, then they wondered, and before long there was a dull assumption that Tristan Wrye had been dead for close to half a century. Güster strode on, adding tears to the rain, and his grief was much increased by remorse, because he was in debt to the dying man. They had never met personally, but it had been Wrye, more than any other poet, who had shown him the way. Without Wrye, he would have been totally different, possibly some spiritually impoverished hack, rich in other ways perhaps, but he would not be the copious and - well, estimable poet that he was. Sometimes people coupled their names and sometimes Güster would smile with an interior, difficult knowledge which he could nevertheless transmit, if pressed. It was only natural that he should write like Tristan Wrye. Wrye had opened up certain poetic possibilities, then had abandoned them. Güster had recognized these openings and he had gone in and had exploited them - had mined them, as it were - because they were there, unclaimed. Güster was present, Wrye was past; but it would be more than a gesture if, at what ever services there would be, Güster were to take all his own works and lay them like a wreath at the grave - The Indirect Works of Tristan Wrye, he could say, written during the half-century or more in which Wrye had supposedly written nothing. 96</page><page sequence="3">THE HOT HOMAGE Back in his comfortable flat, Güster showered, put on his robe, made tea, and sat brooding at his writing desk. Soon he began to write. It was growing dark. Something untoward started to happen to his head, which immobilized him rather. That would be a stroke, he thought. He had always expected a heart attack, but it was his brain after all. Not surprising, considering. . . . Sometimes left one virtually unimpaired. One of the directors claimed to have had sixteen strokes and he was still going. They came from tension, of course. It was important not to panic. Rather like snakebite. Then he found that he could move. Carefully he stood up, reaching for the light switch, when an unearthly light turned on him. It staggered him against the desk. "No!" he exclaimed, shielding his eyes. An angel with a flaming pen descended towards him and his intentions were clear. "I'm not the one!" Güster cried, backing away. "You're off your course. Wrye is your man. I'm Güster. I say, my name is Güster - Damon Güster - Damon Wriothsley Güster, although I seldom use the middle - " If only he could get the personage to talk, to get his mind off whatever it was on! "I am not qualified for the purposes with which you believe yourself to be motivated. I don't like to disillusion you, but I am a Marxist and a Freudian. It won't work with me, young fellow! I say, tell me something about your childhood - or is this it? I've never seen anyone so young and so - impressionable - of your stat- ure! You should be thoroughly ashamed of yourself!" Not a word in reply. The angel merely advanced until he had Güster in a corner. "Sorry," said Güster and went into his boxer's crouch - he had been rather good at sparring in his time. "I'll have to sock you." In utmost simplicity, without seeming to move fast or even adroitly, the angel took him by the wrists, opened him up as if he were a broom closet, and got inside him, wings and all. "Ah-h-h-h-h!" Frightening, cataclysmic pain wracked him as his will burst and gave way and his inner reservations were displaced. To be possessed forcibly in such a way, and at his 97</page><page sequence="4">PRAIRIE SCHOONER age! God, Marx, Freud, what had he done to deserve this? Never, since becoming a man, had he consciously asked for a union of this type - not a union, but an occupation, worse than Anschlussl No, he definitely had no inclination toward such a forced merger. It would finish him, of that he was certain, because his heart wasn't up to it. A glimpse of himself in the mirror caused him to whimper in disbelief, to blurt out ridiculously: "Oh, please, Sir! I'm not old enough!" For he was supernaturally young and impossibly beautiful. Divine light emanated from him. "How do you think/ feel?" demanded the enclosed angel in a voice burning with love and wisdom and grief. "Poor little chap, try to understand. I must do it, I can't help myself. Prom- ise you won't resist any more." "Oh, God! I want to die - but not this way!" "I'm sorry, you'll just have to go through with it. Now - relax, child." "You are the Angel of Death?" "No, I'm not, and don't give me any more trouble or it will hurt more than you can imagine." "Just get it over with! I can't stand pain!" "A bit of advice," said the angel very gently, "before I - be- fore we get down to it, I want you to know that I love you - " "I know, I know!" " - however, I must warn you not to become attached to me." "Yes! No! Ha, ha, ha!" "You're getting used to it, aren't you?" Ecstasy was only the beginning. Hard work lay ahead of them. They sat down as one, Güster and the angel. They crossed out what Güster had written and began again. The angel's hand, pervading his, wrote on and on. Sometimes the angel would pause and look up and smile as if to say, "It's a bit of a strain on all of us, dear Chaps, but it shouldn't take much longer." And during these pauses, if Güster had written some- thing, they would very likely cross it out and continue as be- fore, united in their efforts. 98</page><page sequence="5">THE HOT HOMAGE By midnight it was over with, finished, consummated. With a deep sigh the angel came out of him, stood for a moment reeling slightly, then quickly resumed the radiance of his first appearance, and departed. Güster fell forward over his desk like an old trenchcoat some one had tossed there. The concen- trated grinding which had accompanied the ecstasy would surely have killed him if the angel had made even the slightest inept move. In time, the victim (as he thought of himself) managed to pull himself together and sit up. Now that it was over with - There were sixty lines. Surprisingly few, considering the circumstances. True, the angel had been impeded by having to work through him. It was an elegy on the death of Tristan Wrye - although he was not mentioned by name - and it was in the Güster style which had sprung from the master. The title: "Homage," sim- ply. If anything of Guster's survived a hundred years - perhaps a little longer: five hundred? - this was it, this poem written in profound grief and wisdom and love; and yes, un- deniably, in ecstasy. What majesty! What beauty! Qual maraviglia! Beside it, all his other poems were - well, minor. Güster felt both pride and humility at having been chosen to be the instrument of this work: by a poet, for a poet, it was also an elegy for mankind, written by an angel; and so it was a love song, with the erotic imagery of mysticism, celebrating the joy of union of the human and the divine, death and love, the seasons of man and nature, the dance of life, dauntless, endless renewal. . . . It was an historic event, the death of Tristan Wrye and the birth of the classical masterpiece commemorating his passing. Indeed, it was a public event. Güster thought it would be ap- propriate for the poem to appear - alone, with wide margins - on the front page of the Times. That should present no insurmountable difficulties. Two of the key editors of that newspaper were great admirers of his; and in his business aspect he was the publisher of one and the unofficial agent of the other. They shared his views on 99</page><page sequence="6">PRAIRIE SCHOONER almost everything. Civilization had quickened, not dulled their sensibilities and although they themselves were not great, they could recognize greatness, especially when they came across it in traditional form. They were awfully decent. Güster spent the rest of the night in a happy trance of fulfillment. When morning came, he phoned his office to say that he would not be coming to work this day. Then he dialed a number of the Times, but before it could ring, he hung up. It had just occurred to him to check the morning papers. One of the inside pages contained a terse statement: Tris- tan Wrye in critical condition. Asked if there was any hope, the doctor in charge had merely said that they were doing all that was humanly possible to keep him alive. Pulse very low. Breath- ing scarcely perceptible. Intravenous feeding discontinued. That meant - ? Unable to assimilate any more at the moment. The afternoon and evening papers contained substantially the same brief report. Little change in Wrye's condition. In- travenous feeding resumed, matter of procedure. No signifi- cance attached. Damon Güster passed the day and most of the night read- ing and rereading "Homage," although it was intact in his mind - he could close his eyes and see it, or he could put his fingers in his ears and hear it; but he liked to look at it. It was so powerful, so perfect, he could think of no way whatever in which it might be improved. He would not risk tampering with it, not even to the extent of exchanging a comma for a semico- lon. In an essential sense, the poem was out of his hands. It belonged to the ages. Literally, inadvertently, by an odd fluke in timing, it re- mained in his hands; so he would have to be its curator, as it were, and a very discreet one. There existed the possibility of an awkward contretemps if the elegy appeared prematurely. Reverently he typed out a perfect copy of "Homage"; but it would scarcely be decent of him to sign it - or to dedicate it - as yet. Indeed, he would appear ludicrous. Both subject and ob- ject of the poem must remain anonymous for the present. Next day, a brief statement in the Times repeated the one made the night before. Tristan Wrye critically ill. Pulse. . . . 100</page><page sequence="7">THE HOT HOMAGE Breathing. . . . Intravenous. . . . The evening edition re- minded the reader who had got nearly through the paper, that Wrye was critically ill, but it left out the details. On the follow- ing day, there was no mention of Wrye at all, in any of the newspapers. Güster phoned the hospital. No, there was no substantial change in the poet's condition. Again, that night, he phoned. No change. There was no change the next day, or the next. Twice a day, morning and evening, Güster telephoned the hospital, listening carefully for any discrepancies in the word- ing of the report. On the evening of the fifth day, a cool, careful, female voice told him that Mr. Wrye was "seriously" ill. Did that mean - ? It meant only that his condition was not quite as critical as it had been. Was there hope, after all? Very little. Feeding continued, but one could hardly expect, at this point, to reverse the habit of a lifetime. What habit? Oh, not eating. Substandard calorie intake, that sort of thing. The voice cued him and hung up. Güster typed out a second copy of "Homage" and put it in his safety-deposit box at a bank. Then he put the first copy in the same sort of box in another bank. The original, hand- scrawled, extremely valuable manuscript, he burned, partly to deal with something in himself that cried out for mortification, and partly to get rid of the evidence. Returning to work, he immediately proposed a new pa- perback edition oí The Poetical Works of Tristan Wrye. His fellow directors looked at one another and shrugged. They would lose money. Not very much, said Güster. Call it bread upon the waters. It was a slender volume. Physically, it would be very modest; still, it could be considered a prestige item. Also, the poet lay in the hospital, near death. Macabre though it might seem at the moment, there had already been a certain amount of free publicity. There would soon, said Güster, be a great deal of publicity; and although he would say no more, he radiated such confidence that they agreed with him on the spot. Honor strongly suggested that he visit the old poet in the 101</page><page sequence="8">PRAIRIE SCHOONER hospital, but he was afraid. Güster had a thick, heavy face, but a thin skin and a nervous system that was practically on the surface, so that his expression was always rippling and chang- ing, helplessly declaring whatever he happened to be feeling. It was not an ideal face for a man in business; so he had a reputation for being forthright. His only protection lay in hav- ing defensible thoughts and feelings, and at best a disarming readiness to take his lumps. At the end of a fortnight Tristan Wrye had recovered suf- ficiently to be dismissed from the hospital. An ambulance took him to his lodgings, a nurse stayed with him until he could manage for himself, and after that she looked in on him every few days, bringing all sorts of provisions, medicines, tonics, cordials, vitamins - love gifts, she said, from his publishers. Wrye accepted all these benefits graciously, although he was mystified. His publishers had been dead for decades. Of course publishing houses sometimes got resurrected in name only or lost their names like maidens when they got merged; but he had neither the strength nor the inclination to question closely this new turn of fortune. A junior editor with a flair for discretion came bearing a contract for a new paperback edition oïThe Poetical Works, also a quick note from the Society of Authors advising the poet that in its opinion, it was a solid agreement, improbable but real, and should be signed instantly. The contract brought Wrye an unheard-of advance of a thousand pounds, which he promptly turned over to the Society of Authors. (The Society sighed and took note. Paupers couldn't stand wealth, just as rich men couldn't stand poverty, except in others.) The advance had come from Guster's private bank account and it was not tax-deductible. By handing the whole amount to the Society, the old man had frustrated him, although he didn't like to admit it. It was a sensible move, considering that Wrye was said to be getting senile and might have lost the money - or thrown it away on a night of high living which, in all probability, would have carried him off. Güster took one of the two copies of "Homage" out of the bank and began carrying it, folded, in the shirt pocket over his 102</page><page sequence="9">THE HOT HOMAGE heart. It was still unsigned, undedicated. It made him very uncomfortable. He put it back in the bank. After a few days, he took it out again and resumed the practice of carrying it as before, but clipped securely to the heart pocket. Either way, he could not escape the feeling that he had stumbled into a rather serious wickedness - a touch of black magic, with an intended victim, a fetish, and above (under, behind) all, the will of the practitioner. Güster was determined not to will what he willed. What was time, after all, but sequence? Surely this would not be the first time some one had reshuffled events slightly, directed them (he was a director) so that in the long view they would not appear to be an offense to reason. In the meantime? Limbo had been created expressly for the meantime - a good word for it, meantime. It saw coextensive with, but separate from, the Eternal Now, just as an elegy on the death of a poet could - and did - coexist with his life. In due time, then, the new paperback edition oiThe Poetical Works appeared. Styles had changed so much since those verses were written, it was as if centuries, not decades, had passed. Hardly anyone wrote or thought like that any more. Hardly anyone was entitled to, except Wrye, because it was his constel- lation. They seemed so ancient, those poems, that one looked at them with fresh curiosity and did not think of judging them by the newest anti-poems. It was surprising, how they held up. Young people, who had not yet lost their generosity, liked them even though they did not deal with the Apocalypse or show that poetry was no longer possible. Older people liked them for older reasons. The secret of their public success, said one critic, was that they did not compete with any living poet except Damon Güster, who had already acknowledged his debt. The poems burned with passion, plumbed depths, sang nobly, were beautiful, all without being healthy. Post-Dowson, pre-Eliot? Traditional? Well, perhaps, but perversely so. In search of parallels and precedents, a Johnsonian critic com- pared him, as a case history, though not in style, to Housman, "who caught evolution napping and ignored it with impunity." 103</page><page sequence="10">PRAIRIE SCHOONER Technically, then, Tristan Wrye was alive ("and unwell, like poetry," said an Oxford wag, ambiguous because he was genuinely puzzled), clinically meaningless because the last of his breed, unrepeatable under lab conditions because sterile, "boldly advancing into the feckless past." One did not build a cult around an anachronism, but there was a ripple of interest approaching fad proportions, among numbers of people - too early to run polls, but shrewd budgeteers were classifying the first wave of buyers as poets, pensioners, widows, clerks, stu- dents of English Lit, and doctors. They bought out the edition, small and cheap as it was. Guster's colleagues cheerfully admitted that they had been wrong on this occasion. They insisted on running off a few thousand more copies. It wasn't likely to sweep the country, but there was a demand of sorts, and it would be pleasant to pick up a few shillings while performing a public service. There was a demand, too, which Tristan Wrye did not resist, that he read his poems in a public hall, as part of a poetry-reading series. Something in him melted and gave way. To be wanted! Oh, indeed he would oblige! Once when he was young, he had been wanted and he had not given himself. A certain angel had become dissatisfied with their platonic ar- rangement, there had been a scene, the angel had vanished, taking with him the bardic power. . . . No, Wrye would not repeat that mistake. As surely as hanging taught the miscreant his lesson, so had abandonment taught Wrye his. It was a beauteous audience, big and quiet, very respectful. In the last row sat Damon Güster, but he did not stay long. He was too moved; also, he preferred not to be recognized. A number of literate people were there. Some had met him in person, perhaps to cozen him, in vain, into publishing their poems. Others - possibly most of those present - had seen his earlier faces on the jackets of his own plump volumes. The old invalid looked the way a dying poet ought to look before lying down for one of the last times, with a splendid, handsome, sensitive face, delicate features, too fragile for a human - a fossilized Apollo - with a floating cloud (not a mane) of pure white hair. Valedictorian? Thanatic. Around his 104</page><page sequence="11">THE HOT HOMAGE translucent throat he wore a loose foulard, silk, of a gorgeous red color with little blue spots that collectively gave a magnetic boost to his eyes. A touch of Parkinson's disease, more or less held in check through the years, caused him to shake, or rather to fluctuate rhythmically, though not excessively, all over, as if with strong emotion. By a happy accident, this same disorder underlay, built up, made possible the impressive phenomenon of his voice. It also shook, like the rest of him, but he had learned somehow, with his perfect ear for sound - and what was un- doubtedly a feeling for theater - to synchronize its throbbings with the poems he was reading aloud. Beauties of sound and depths of meaning which even his most skillful admirers had failed to catch through the decades, came welling forth. One afternoon a young American who looked both bright and worn, came into Güster' s office. His name was Sumption (curi- ous, thought Güster - probably part Catholic) and he had a proposal. "Damon Güster, I have read and reread every line of poetry that you have ever written." The warm words were spoken with detachment. "Ah?" Güster waited, alert for tricks, but his heart beat wildly against the masterpiece in his pocket. "In my opinion, you are the greatest poet living in the English language." "Nnn." Not quite no. Güster wanted to say "There is one greater than I!" or at least something civilized, a bit of humor- ous self-effacement, but he thought it better to say as little as possible until he could get his feelings clipped together. "Besides being your passionately devoted reader," Sump- tion continued (he had dark red hair, styled, and swampy eyes which he could doubtless use to emphasize a point), "I repre- sent Great Contemporaries. The name is new, but actually it's a merger of four established agencies. I am also new - nearly new." A nicely diffident smile. "This is my first assignment to the lecture branch." Güster nodded politely. 105</page><page sequence="12">PRAIRIE SCHOONER "My branch of Great Contemporaries arranges for English poets to tour the United States and read their poems - and talk a little, you know. When they said, 'Won't you take this assign- ment?' I said, 'If I may be allowed to choose.' They said, 'Of course.' I could think of only one name, one poet, one man." "There is," said Güster, "more than one." "You're the greatest. You are the one. It would be such a tremendous honor for all of us if Damon Güster would lead off the series. America loves you, my agency loves you, / love you." "Thank you very much." Güster knew about those tours. They were remunerative, demoralizing, and strenuous. Not everyone came back. "I am delighted that you like poetry and I am enormously flattered by your invitation. Now, since you have been so kind - and so forthright - the least I can do is to be scrupulously honest with you. In confidence?" "In confidence," Sumption murmured reverently. "I am not as robust as I appear. I have a bad heart." "Oh!" "As long as I stick to routine and avoid excitement - " "As bad as that!" "Yes. I see it rather clearly. I would collapse on the plat- form." "That wouldn't be so good," Sumption admitted. A collaps- ing speaker could pull an agency down with him. "Even if I were in good condition," Güster continued, "I would still be obliged to tell you that I am only Number Two." "Oh, I don't agree at all, Sir. Who is Number One?" "Tristan Wrye." "But he's dead- isn't he?" "Not at all. He's been in retreat and now he's out. I heard him read the other night. The presence of the man is dazzling, and the voice - absolutely magnificent! Prometheus bringing fire from the gods to mankind!" "Wrye, you say?" "Zarathustra living among the eagles for fifty-some-odd years, alone on a craggy moutaintop, meditating, communing with the Divine Life Principle. Then, after that timeless 106</page><page sequence="13">THE HOT HOMAGE sojourn, he descends to dwell among humans once again, to give of his wit and wisdom, his beauty, his - well, why not say it? - his divinity." "I had no idea!" "Yes. I imagine it would be easy for you to mistake his fragility for weakness. Englishmen are deceptive in their ap- pearances." "I know, I know. But he must be a hundred years old!" "Nowhere near that - and in excellent condition. Light as a feather, weighs almost nothing. Nothing to carry around, you see. Wiry! But I - built like a bullock. How long would you last if you had to carry me around, eh?" Güster was becoming increasingly edgy and hard to work with. The other directors talked about it for some time, then very diplomatically, in a clubby atmosphere, they included him in their conversation. The subject: early retirement. A man who had given of himself as much as he had ought to be eligible for a full pension, even if he still had a couple of years to go. To their relief, he responded favorably to the idea. It would fit in nicely, he said, with a travel project he had been nourishing. The main cause of his irritability had been lack of informa- tion about the health of Tristan Wrye, on a day-to-day basis. Transatlantic cables and telephone calls were unsatisfactory and expensive. There was no BBC coverage of the poet's tour of America. London newspapers seemed to have other grave matters to occupy them. Having been in New York several times on business, and having recently seen a documentary on existence there, he changed planes at the airport and went on to Minneapolis, arriving late in the evening. On the following night, he sat in the last row of an auditorium. Through a pair of opera glasses, he observed Tristan Wrye in action for ten minutes; then he left unobtrusively and went back to his hotel. There was no doubt that Wrye was showing the strain - pale, palsied, fumbling his pages, with Sumption hovering anxiously behind him, ready to prompt him or to catch him. A pitiful spectacle, that - and a bad bargain. Poor old fellow! Poor Sumption! 107</page><page sequence="14">PRAIRIE SCHOONER The young man was skilled in persuasion, the old man had decided to accept life - it had been a long time since anybody had tried to persuade him to do much of anything. Tristan Wrye had said yes, he would be delighted to fly - with Sumption - over the Arctic wastes to the New World, to read his poems, reminisce, reflect aloud - anything. All he asked was that Sumption manage the mechanics of the whole expedi- tion and attend him personally from beginning to end. Tristan Wrye never paid, seemed not to be aware of trans- actions. Money unrolled tastefully before him like a carpet and he walked graciously over it. Sumption picked up after him. They went by train, by plane, by private car. Night after night, in the auditoriums of universities and colleges, the poet read to good audiences - "tributaries," Sumption called them - among whom were those - hospital attendants, doughnut makers, farm hands with M.A.'s - who knew his poems by heart but experienced darshan all the same on hear- ing them from the mouth of the master. Güster followed discreetly, doggedly, "Homage" over his heart at all times, unsigned, undedicated. For a while, he was able to keep up a fantasy of himself as a Scotland Yard man assigned to protect an eminent British poet in a half-savage land; but his mind wandered when he thought of assassins. They were always political. There would be no gunning down of Tristan Wrye. Dying or not, he was in his stride. The pure English voice, the wild quaver ("a tongue of golden flame," "the vibes, man, the vibes!") projected the familiar lines out where they gripped and shook his hearers with a passion not quite so familiar in Middle America - or in England either. The Parkinson's dis- ease was becoming worse, Güster noted. Standing ovations, always. The cloud of white hair, the fossil beauty enhanced by a magic foulard, the incredible fragility - spirit alone sustained him - insulated him from tides of worshippers. Around him was an invisible glass case with an invisible sign: Do Not Touch the Holy Relic. The readings exhausted him. Supported by Sumption, he 108</page><page sequence="15">THE HOT HOMAGE always retired immediately afterward to his hotel - the hospi- tality of university presidents and the like could easily prove fatal. The ancient genius was not to be caught in a social trap; but occasionally he would admit a young poet to his hotel room for tea. "Fifteen minutes," Sumption would whisper with a smile. Fifteen days at the most, thought Güster, grieved and grim. Probably fewer. The man had starved most of his life, had no physical reserves, no margin. At this point, a common cold would finish him. Or a fall. The end was in sight. Wrye's voice would trail off in the middle of a sentence, and Sumption, sitting behind him on the stage, would prompt him. Or he would mix up the pages of his manuscript and Sumption would put them in order; or he would drop them and Sumption would rescue them. The audience would gasp, murmur and moan sympathetically at these mishaps. Some- times they would applaud. Once, Wrye lost his balance and Sumption neatly righted him. The audience gave the couple a standing ovation. Some one sobbed loudly. A rustle of kleenex .... Damon Güster, spending much time in hotel rooms, was beginning to wonder if he had done the right thing after all in coming to the United States. Vaguely aware that he was eating too much and drinking too much, getting fatter without enjoy- ing it, he did nothing to counteract it. He was increasingly preoccupied. At bars, he would order two drinks, as if he were expecting some one, and of course he would drink both of them. Sometimes he would order two more. Güster had both copies of "Homage" with him: one in his heart pocket, as always, the other in his suitcase. One night in his hotel room, having returned from a Wrye-Sumption per- formance, he began drinking a vicious fermented maize sold locally, which he had mistaken for whiskey. He had recited "Homage" thousands of times, under his breath - in fact, he was usually doing it. On this night, he recited it, not in a voice that could be heard in the next room, but aloud anyway. No, he could not recite at all well, because he had no throb and no quaver - but what a poem! What a very great poem! It would 109</page><page sequence="16">PRAIRIE SCHOONER remain long after his voice was gone. And Wrye's voice. And Sumption's voice, for that matter. It was dark, except for a small light in the shower stall, but he could see well enough for his purposes. Taking both copies of "Homage," he spread them out on the table, then he stood, breathing heavily and swaying a little, in the middle of the room. "In all conscience," he said earnestly to the chandelier, which hovered like something about to sting, "I would sooner believe in spirits than in an anthropomorphic deity, and to address a pantheistic life-principle would be to miss the point, I am sure. Indeed, it would be tautological, would it not, to assume that it is in need of instruction about the state I'm in. The sparrow and all that - if you follow me?" The chandelier was not moved. Güster became more em- phatic: "I have always tried to be fair. Do unto others, you know. I dislike stealth and secrecy. I dislike obstinate silence - indeed, I have been known to speak in behalf of the opposition in those rare instances when sullenness - or was it a conscious- ness of its error? - caused it to reject an open exchange of views. I am ready to answer questions. Very well. 'The whole shines forth from all its parts,' you say. That has always been my policy. The firm must stand behind its agent, and the agent stands for the firm. Sir, the honor of your firm is in your hands! Finish what you started! Don't imagine that you are going to leave me holding the bag! I don't care how busy you are, you are morally obligated. Now, I want whoever is respon- sible for this - " he pointed, he shook his finger at the two copies of "Homage" - "to come back here and tell me what I'm supposed to do with it!" Nothing happened. No one appeared. Güster sat down at the table and waited. After a moment he said: "Dear me! That was the executive, wasn't it? I'm afraid I was a bit peremptory just now. I'm terribly sorry about that. ... It can't have been easy for you. Not then, not now, not all this time. . . . Look here, Angel, I'll do anything you say. I mean it. Think for a moment. . . . You are paying attention. . . . Angel? You must realize that I had never been possessed before - if that makes 110</page><page sequence="17">THE HOT HOMAGE any difference nowadays. The truth is, I was frightened. It went against the grain, I needn't tell you that. My conditioning had been completed some time before. . . . Angel! I had no basis for comparison, no perspective. Through rigors - why, it was like childbirth, wasn't it? After all, what's a body for, eh? I say, Angel - " his tone was cozening, seductive - "You really are quite presentable." After waiting a reasonable length of time, perhaps a little longer, he stood up again, took one of the two copies of "Hom- age," tapped it deprecatingly with the back of his fingers and held it up for the chandelier to identify. "I entered into an agreement in good faith," he said. "I've kept my end of the bargain, if you want to call it that. I am innocent of any misdemeanor connected with it. As for thoughts, they are a natural cauldron. I take no responsibility for them, only for my actions. If, in your opinion, I have done something that requires correction, now is the time to come out with it. I am a straightforward man, and a busy one. . . . An unsigned agreement is prima facie suspect - it has no validity." Slowly, deliberately he tore up the manuscript, casting an occasional Medea-like glance upward and around. The pieces made a neat little mound on the table. With a sardonic smile he scooped them into one hand, carried them into the bathroom, and flushed them down the toilet. Then he came back, took the one surviving manuscript of "Homage" and made as if to do the same to it; but he paused. The pause grew longer and longer. "Damn it!" he muttered. "It doesn't belong to me!" Instead of tearing it up, he refolded it and put it back in his pocket. "As for our relationship - " his voice was cold and clipped - "I shall not take the initiative again." To follow the itinerary next day, he took a four-hour bus ride (he had thought he was buying a train ticket) to a univer- sity in Nebraska. (Wrye himself had been transported there in the private plane of a millionaire who, as he said, had cut his teeth on Wrye's poetry.) That night Güster did not feel at all well, but he could not bear to miss the reading. There was a change, a cumulative 111</page><page sequence="18">PRAIRIE SCHOONER change for the worse. Why, the old man was hardly able to stand and mouth his lines - a mere puppet for a low commer- cial agency! It was outrageous to exhibit the quaking old wreck like this. And oh, the wild quaver! Impossibly histrionic, a broken bagpipe of a voice! Güster left his seat at the rear of the auditorium, marched down the murmuring but permissive aisle, stamped up on the stage, and collapsed. Tristan Wrye dropped his manuscript and tottered towards him, Sumption succoring. Students leaped about. In the audience, a defensive-looking man began to admit that he was a physician, but he thought it was proba- bly a matter for the police. Lying amid the scattered pages of manuscript, with excited and curious strangers hovering over him, Güster thrust "Homage" at a student, opened his mouth, shut his eyes, and died. Obediently the student passed the folded paper to the sur- viving poet, who took it automatically and put it with the manuscript which people were restoring to him, page by page. "Why, it's Güster!" said Sumption. "He must have been passing through." "Güster, Güster, Güster," Wrye echoed and put his hands over his face to block out the confusion. Güster who? The scene, the gesture, the Parkinson's disease all con- spired. Standing there with his face in his hands, shaking and swaying, Wrye looked to be the very figure of grief. Actually, he was puzzled - moved, too, not by grief but by affection. Sumption's strong young arm around his shoulders urged him gently into the wings. "Like a son to me!" the poet quavered in a voice that was out of control but clearly, widely audible, the beautiful English delivery like shattered crystal. Everyone heard and everyone, including Sumption, thought he meant the fat man who had fallen on the stage. Sumption thought it best to cancel the readings for a while. There followed two weeks of rest and seclusion in a cottage by a lake, as a guest of the plane-provider, while Sumption went off to New York for consultations. In addition to a valet and a 112</page><page sequence="19">THE HOT HOMAGE maid, there was a young woman secretary who was eager to be of use to the great man. As everyone knew that Tristan Wrye's eyesight was failing, she brought a typewriter that made enor- mous letters, typed out one of his poems and asked him how he liked it. Wrye clapped his hands in childish delight. The pages from which he had been reading struck her as being in bad condition, tattered, smudged, with fingerprints and even footprints. One page had been folded - it had impos- sibly small letters. She would soon remedy that. Within min- utes, it seemed to him, she copied out his life work in those splendid, huge, black letters. Then she threw away the disrep- utable old manuscript. "Won-der-ful!" Wrye sang, his eyes watering with happi- ness. When Sumption came back, he found the old man rather more gone in the head than before, but not consistently. Process of decay hastened by untoward incident at last read- ing, he thought; but there was one more reading left in him. There had to be. They were firmly committed. That would be it, though - the end. No West Coast. The Society of Authors was investigating the death of Damon Güster. They implied that Great Contemporaries might be in some way culpable (and liable) and they had be- come very solicitous about Tristan Wrye, wanting to know the terms of his contract, how he was being treated, the state of his health. They sniffed chicanery. The deaths of two English poets on American soil, in rapid succession, would mean the end of Great Contemporaries, whose books really were not in order. In New Orleans, Wrye gave his last public reading. Sump- tion hovered about nervously, hoping that he would not try to say anything, that he would not lose the place - or drop the whole sheaf of poems, as he had done last time. Tristan Wrye gazed vacantly out at the audience until they began to whisper. Sumption, sweating, hissed "Read! "As if awakened from a dream, Wrye started, stared at the manu- script before him, a look of bewilderment on his face, then a look of acceptance, of resignation, of an awareness that trans- cended (they said later) his immediate, literal circumstances. 113</page><page sequence="20">PRAIRIE SCHOONER The old man read "Homage." When he finished, tears were coursing down his face. In those days he could really write, he thought. His best one yet - had it tucked away some- where. Must have loved that chap. The audience stood silently for a long, long moment. Sumption, who had never voluntarily read any poetry, but who had heard a certain amount in the line of duty (he had a wife and five children, although he was barely twenty-five), explained afterward to some professors that "Homage" was an elegy for a very close friend and fellow-poet, Damon Güster. Wrye had composed it during a two-week sojourn at a cottage by a lake in Nebraska. "A wild place," muttered Wrye - he was in the Lake Coun- try on his twenty-sixth birthday, with a very close friend and fellow-poet (an angel, really, but he had taken too much for granted, Tommy had). Newspapers published "Homage" on their front pages. Tristan Wrye gave everyone permission, including the London Times. 114</page></plain_text>
