<plain_text><page sequence="1">Review Article Alfredo Frassati in the History and Historiography of Modern Italy' John Thayer University of Minnesota With the publication of the first two volumes of Luciana Frassati's three-volume, six-part biography of her father, students of contemporary Italian and European history have at their disposal an impressive, if rambling, accumulation of documents and personal impressions to add to previously published collections illustrating the careers of major figures from the world of Italian journalism, notably Luigi Albertini's Venti anni di vita politica (1951), his extensive Epistolario (1968), and Olindo Malagodi's Conversazioni della guerra 1914-1919 (1960). As is apparent from Gabriele De Rosa's ample introduction, Luciana Frassati's work has been completed. With the publication of the third and final volume, it will cover Frassati's career, hence the history of La Stampa of Turin, from 1895 when he and Luigi Roux bought out the provincial Gazzetta Piemontese, which Frassati, as sole owner after 1900, built into a highly respected national and European newspaper, to 1926 when Fiat's founder, Giovanni Agnelli, in Luciana Frassati's words, "bought La Stampa, at the moment of its suppression by the Fascists, for a ridiculous price, thanks to Mussolini" (I, 1:85, n. 56). Although its chronological limits are the years from the Bank of Rome scandals to the consolidation of the dictatorship, this biography is also a daughter's defense of her father's political career, a celebration of "a life based on confidence in freedom and truth." Luciana Frassati carries the story down to our own times in order to discuss and to critique historiographical interpretations that have grown up around the more dramatic episodes of Frassati's life: his ties to Giolitti, therefore to Giolitti's antiwar policy that failed in May 1915; his and La Stampa's stand during the war years; and, finally, Frassati's position on foreign and domestic affairs in the postwar period, in Berlin as Giolitti' s ambassador, very sympathetic to the German case against the Versailles settlement,2 from which post he continued to advise-or sought to advise-Giolitti with regard to the handling of Italian politics during the years that witnessed the formation of the Partito Popolare, the disintegration of the Italian Socialist Party, and the sudden spread of the once marginal fasci di combattimento. Of these and related issues surrounding Frassati's career, it can be said that time has healed no wounds. The stand Frassati took in 1915 has become the ' Luciana Frassati, Un uomo, un giornale: Alfredo Frassati. Politica e Storia. Raccolta di studi e testi a cura di Gabriele De Rosa.

The question of the "origins" of what scholars have become accustomed to call a "totalitarianism"-itself a neologism used with equal fervor by Fascists and anti-Fascists -has generated a voluminous literature. In the field of Italian historiography, the issue has been exceptionally confused by equivocations, paradoxes, and the apologetics of the casuist. The search for the "responsibles," those to whom its evils or its glories might be ascribed, was first undertaken by men and women who were to become bitter enemies, yet who had once joined forces in that political hotchpotch known to students of modern Italy as the interventisti. 3 These "interventionists" argued that Italy should abandon the neutrality pro- claimed in August 1914 in order to back the Entente's war against the Central Powers. They have since become, both as a result of their subsequent political careers and their contributions to European historiography, the crux of the logical dilemma of those who would fashion a propaganda or ideology-which is only to say a history conceived as explanation-out of those distant events. It is here that the quest for the precursors runs up against the dynamics of action, the wholly free dialectic that reveals the metaphysical nature of the categories essential to any explanation. As a consequence, the term "interventionist" has become part of Italian political and historiographical terminology, where it is handled with the same scholarly dexterity as comparable political vocabulary rising out of periods of prolonged violence. The Americans' use of "isolationist" (1922) may serve to illustrate to those unfamiliar with the specifics of Italian history the kind of apologetics and tenacious passions that surround the issue of the interventisti. Not unlike the Italian advocates, of war, the isolationist community was made up of figures whose later activities, especially in their individual responses to Fascism, Bolshevism, and National Socialism, diverged widely. Considerable manipulation of evidence would be required to preserve the virtues of some from the contam- ination of earlier allies who had become evil-as if the course of history were subject to those transcendental forces that allow us to see the saint's inherent grace beneath the outward secular shell of mere human choice and action. In the case of the interventisti-and it is here that Luciana Frassati's contribution to the discussion takes on special significance-those earlier bonds of political comradeship, though they were soon to give way to deadly enmity, left a common residue still to be found in works of the surviving veterans of the prowar movement of 1915 or in the work of scholars who remain sympathetic to their original political aims: hatred of Giolitti, former premier and the unquestioned political hope of those who had struggled to preserve Italian neutrality; disdain for those, like Frassati or Benedetto Croce, who came to be identified with the politician, I The following figures from journalism, belles lettres, and the academic community generally were prominent leaders or youthful followers of this prowar movement of 1914- 15: Albertini, Amendola, Bergamini, Borgese, Calamandrei, Ettore Ciccotti, Colajanni, Coppola, Corradini, D'Annunzio, De Ruggiero, Einaudi, Federzoni, Ferrero, Forges Da- vanzati, Gentile, Gramsci, Grandi, Lussu, Marinetti, Matteotti, Mussolini, Nenni, Omodeo, Pantaleoni, Panzini, Papini, Prezzolini, Rocco, Nello and Carlo Rosselli, Salvemini, To- gliatti, Volpe.</page><page sequence="3">Alfredo Frassati 287 as colleagues in the last Giolitti ministry of 1920-21 and as his posthumous defenders. Since ideology prefers personifications to mere facts, this old rancor, which has come down to us in the historiography of postrisorgimental Italy, has taken the form of a contempt for that anthropomorphism called giolittismo, once defined by Alfredo Panzini, in his dictionary of current Italian usage, as "the personal government of Giolitti, a man knowledgeable about many things, and about that which was least good in Italy"-a bit of Fascist liturgy by a former interventionist in which the regime's achievement is explained in terms of a purgation of such corruption. The obverse of this cleverness may be found in those interpretations of Fascism's origins put forth by noted anti-Fascists who have cast the same Giolitti in the role of Mussolini's trailblazer, the "John the Baptist" of the tyranny, as Gaetano Salvemini would write. Even a hasty reading of the documents gathered by Luciana Frassati should convince all save the superstitious of the merely rhetorical value of such gen- eralizations. But of those whose lives were bound up with the events that gave meaning to ideology, few were able to free themselves from the hold of yesterday's passions. Frassati died in 1961, by which time Luigi Albertini's Venti anni di vita politica had appeared. In that multivolume work the charges against the "neutralists," ranging from political ineptitude and moral corruption to outright treason- accusations that gave wartime Italy the appearance of a nation in the midst of civil war-were presented to the public in the form of a history of contemporary Italian politics. Frassati's own contribution to the debate, his pamphlet-length Giolitti (1959), was addressed to Albertini, whose version of the events, Frassati agreed, warranted the comment of a reviewer who labeled Albertini "Giolitti's eternal enemy." Of Albertini's work, Frassati wrote that its fundamental error was that of having reproduced in its pages all the judgmentalism and polemics that appeared in his newspaper [the Corriere della sera of Milan] across two decades. It is the task of a newspaper's owner to reflect daily public opinion; to serve as a goad to government and to political parties; to restrain both the one and the other. One can understand the bitter criticisms of Giolitti whenever strikes, general or partial, broke out. The middle class was frightened and feared the coming of the end of the world. A conservative paper was the interpreter of such fears and apprehension. But a newspaper lives but a day. It is chronicle, not history. It is surprising, therefore, to read in a book that has been mulled over and written more than three decades after these events those same fears and apprehensions repeated. It is an anachronism, that is, out of its time.4 In that Albertini's study was little more than a history of contemporary Italy drawn from the pages of the Corriere della sera, Frassati's criticisms were reasonable. Scholars who have learned about Italian political history from those volumes (as once was the tendency conspicuously in English-speaking academic circles) have run the risk of accepting distortions that occasionally amount to blatant falsification as matters of holy writ, especially as Albertini enjoyed, and merited, the reputation as an enemy of the Fascist dictatorship. But the real problem, the logical problem, was not to be solved by Frassati's demand that the historian be a timeless judge of events. History, as historiography, is always of necessity "anachronistic"; the thought of getting really "into the midst of the stream" reveals, by the figure of speech needed to express such an 4 A.

This was already clear, not only from Albertini's work, but from Frassati's rebuttal, his brief but moving tribute to Giolitti. It will be even more evident to readers of his daughter' s outspoken praise of her father, in which the antagonists of 1914-15 are presented to us by one who knew many of them and whose own interest in the world of letters and politics began to be formed during a war that became the crucial experience of their lives. And when such sentiments, such affections, are those of the poet, which Luciana Frassati also is, and of the family chronicler (as witness her efforts to preserve the memory of her brother, Frassati's only other child, a Dominican terziario who died still a youth, whose charitable acts inspired widespread admiration, giving rise to the process for beatification still in progress), to which diverse activities may be added Luciana Frassati's own political career, recorded in memoirs that are part of the documentation of European politics in the era of the Second World War,5 of Italo-German relations, and the Nazi occupation of Poland, it is not surprising that Un uomo, un giornale makes no claims to objectivity and shows no undue concern for professional monographic etiquette. As a consequence, the general reader will be taxed by the abundance, and also by the questionable relevance, of many of these details. Luciana Frassati's re- luctance to part with much of this otherwise interesting minutiae, facts she confesses to be "apparently marginal" (I, 1:1), gives these volumes the flavor of those memorie recondite, glimpses into the secrets of the court, so much in vogue in the seventeenth century, and so much a part of the emerging genre of historical romance, a literary form which this biography at times resembles. If these features prove difficult to readers who are not versed in the culture and politics of con- temporary Italy, the pedants of the academic community will be scandalized by occasional uncertainties as to the source of some of the documentation in the notes and the lengthy appendices. A careful reading will show that the primary sources made public in these volumes, many for the first time, have been gathered together thanks to Luciana Frassati's pursuit over several decades of information in the keeping or in the memories of the survivors of the " Giolittian Age," their children, grandchildren, widows and widowers, friends and enemies alike: a collection made possible by her extensive personal contacts and unflagging energies. From Bevione, Salva- torelli, and Prezzolini; from the families of Scarfoglio and Serao, Croce and Tilgher; and from the veterans of La Stampa, this kaleidoscopic work, "part biography, part the history of a newspaper, partly a portrait of giolittismo," De Rosa calls it, is also something of an archival panorama whose often frustrating superficial characteristics or merely academic shortcomings do not detract from its importance for students of contemporary Italian history and historiography. Giolitti, after Frassati, is the main subject and the figure in whom most historians will have the greater interest. Of all these materials none are more revealing than those made available by Giolitti's grandsons, especially by the son of the noted neutralist Deputy Mario Chiaraviglio and Giolitti's daughter.

Casciano, 1949).</page><page sequence="5">Alfredo Frassati 289 scandals and the Di Rudini Ministry of 1896, offer glimpses of Giolitti in moments of philosophical reflection, as well as in political action. Moreover, as Enrichetta Giolitti became herself a protagonist and frequently a critic of her father's policies, especially when it came to Giolitti's refusal, following the Caporetto crisis and then in the early postwar period, to take revenge on the interventisti-despite the daughter's claim that his assassination had been certainly contemplated, and very likely set in motion, by the Salandra government6-these and related archival materials are of particular interest to students of the war and the postwar years. It was also during those years that a bond of friendship grew between the statesman's daughter and the publisher, an intimacy based on their attachment to Giolitti, to his policy that had collapsed in 1915, and to Italy's welfare as they saw it, out of which emerged a correspondence preserved in the second volume of this biography, to be continued in the last volume. Few of the assumptions about the phenomenon of giolittismo will survive a reading of the documents here gathered together. Future scholars will be hard put to describe Giolitti's conduct during the Bank of Rome scandals as other than that of an experienced politician whose public disgrace, at the hands of his rivals and theirjournals, was widely recognized as wholly undeserved, as a result of which common knowledge Giolitti reemerged at the close of the 1890s, and especially during the parliamentary crisis that ended Pelloux's second Ministry, as a leader of the progressive forces of the Chamber. Above all (as this is primarily the portrait of a noted publisher and journalist) the legend of Giolitti, subtle manipulator of newsmen and newspapers, will have to be discarded as well. Frassati was an independent spirit, a strict, even cantankerous, taskmaster. Once he had abandoned thoughts of running for office-in 1902 he looked about for a substitute editor so as to free himself for political campaigning-his only interest was La Stampa. In La Stampa, and in the role of the press generally in the modern state, he saw, as he wrote Luigi Roux at the outset of his editorial career, "a new force, every day more powerful, with unlimited horizons . . . spokesman of this immense power that is public opinion" (I, 1:80). Regarding journalism as a public trust and a patriotic duty: having written tracts defending and defining press freedoms in his early years, when still engaged in acquiring prominence in the field of criminal law and criminology, the thought that La Stampa might become the mouthpiece for any party, or for any political leader, did not enter his mind. Neither, however, is there the slightest indication in Luciana Frassati's work that Giolitti would have welcomed, much less promoted, such a relationship. The theory of the press as instrument of propaganda, as a means of conditioning social behavior, Giolitti regarded as dishonest but also very likely to be the source of far more mischief than any imaginable benefits. In a letter to his daughter, replying to a note to which she had attached summaries of Vorwdrts's coverage of Italian politics in March 1896, Giolitti wrote that though the German socialist paper had said "many just things," its reporting contained "some essentials that are absolutely false which one sees were taken from Italy's most exaggerated press. The fault of the extremist political parties is exaggeration, forgetting that what is exaggerated is false, and has no value whatsoever" (I, 1:494). 6 The standard defense of the Salandra Ministry in the issue of Giolitti's safety, which has been taken up by scholars who are epigoni of this tradition, is Corrado De Biase, L'incolumitd di Giolitti e l'assalto a Montecitorio nel maggio 1915 (Roma, 1957). De Biase was a member of Salandra's political circle of public servants.</page><page sequence="6">290 Thayer The "narrow empiricism" that Giolitti's critics frequently cite as a sign of his limitations, a criticism that finds an occasional echo in Luciana Frassati's own recollection of her father's hero, was no more than a dislike of rhetoric, a refusal to believe that mere concepts of the political world could affect politics in any fundamental, or even probable, hence partially predictable way. In his dislike of overemphasis, and the stress he placed on facticity and veracity, Giolitti was a puritan. Of all the Italians of note with whom he was to become linked, none resembled him more in this general outlook, but also in this emphasis on the spontaneous concreteness of politics, than Croce, with whom ties of mutual admiration were formed in Giolitti's last years, even though, as late as 1920, when Frassati suggested Croce as a member of what was to be the last Ministry, Giolitti reacted with the well-known retort: "But, he's only a philosopher!" It was an objection that Croce -when he leamed of it-understood and approved. No feature of Croce' s historicism is more consistent than the distinction between theory and practice and his consequent ridicule of the vanity of the learned, who imagined a world as it should or might have been and from such fancies formulated programs of political action. It is also true that both politician and logician regarded journalism as a profession whose demands for immediate analysis and explanation encouraged just such imaginative reconstructions of the past, which served as the propagandist's rhetoric or the social scientist's conceptualizations. For La Stampa itself, Giolitti had a high regard based upon the paper's reputation, in European as well as Italian political circles, as a source of reliable information and quick news service. As such, he used it, with other papers, to clarify mistaken reports. It is also true that both he and Frassati, in wholly separate and diverse ways, defended press freedoms which Italy enjoyed in the decades of Giolitti's political prominence. In this sense, Luciana Frassati is right in saying that they shared "a common devotion to freedom and truth" (I, 1:1-2). But there the realtionship ends, at least prior to 1915. For it is not the case that Frassati "was always at his [Giolitti's] side" (I, 1:64), as the daughter claims, or that the paper may be described, as scholars are still doing, as "a Giolittian newspaper." Students of the history of the Italian press have shown that Frassati was extremely critical of Giolitti's handling of Italian politics.7 This will become obvious from the documents that Luciana Frassati has collected and preserved. If she herself, in the face of the facts, tends to foreshadow the political relationship that grew out of the war, this incoherence is but another residue of those old antagonisms, of the bitter political warfare that made gio- littiano a stigma among the interventisti, a badge of honor for their enemies and their posterity. The real as distinct from the conventional picture, the intensity of Frassati's objections to Giolitti's policies, will be particularly evident in these first two volumes where the emphasis falls very heavily on Italian foreign policy. From his first entry into journalism, Frassati defended those diplomats, chief among them General Di Robilant, who had been unhappy with the purely passive, defensive aspects of the Triple Alliance, a negative rather than positive diplomacy which Frassati found incompatible with Italy's interest in the Mediterranean. He shared his friend Max Harden's enthusiasm for Bismarck and had been introduced by Harden to the ousted and petulant Chancellor. But in post-Bismarckian Europe, I V.

Because this monographic study is limited to the early years, to the emergence of La Stampa out of the regional Gazzetta Piemontese, Castronovo tends to</page><page sequence="7">Alfredo Frassati 291 as Frassati saw things, and especially by 1897 when the Franco-Russian entente was public knowledge, Frassati looked upon the 1882 alliance as something of a relic, to be redrafted so as to favor Italy's interests or to be abandoned. Believing, as many did, that England's problems in the Transvaal would draw her out of " splendid isolation"; wishing-and this above all else-to learn from the lessons of 1878, from the "mani nette" with which Italy came out from the Berlin Congress, from the 1882 refusal to take up England's suggestion for joint action in Egypt, Frassati set out to make La Stampa a paper supporting Italian imperialist interests. In 1900, scarcely four years from the Adua debacle that revealed the degree of Italy's military inferiority among the powers contending for the Mediterranean- African sphere, Frassati's watchword was the thoroughly anti-Giolittian: "Be bold! This is the moment to be bold!" Throughout the succeeding Giolittian Age, this remained the thrust of La Stampa's foreign policy recommendations. The fact that Giuseppe Bevione, a Nationalist-Imperialist, served as one of La Stampa's most conspicuous reporters should not be taken as an indication of discordant viewpoints not reflecting Frassati's own outlook. For it is very clear that although he allowed a considerable degree of freedom to his regular staff, on the major issues Frassati was always in charge. For the Triple Alliance, whose function in Italian and European diplomacy was always a central topic, he showed scant affection, writing in 1908: "No one can show that the Triple Alliance has saved the peace of the world. Alas, anyone can demonstrate that it has not saved Italy" (I, 1:287). Frassati's criticism of Giolitti's foreign policy was unrelenting. For Tittoni, former Prefect of Naples whom Giolitti chose as Foreign Minister, and whom he defended when Tittoni stood by the Triple Alliance in the face of the Bosnia Hercegovina crisis, Frassati had nothing but contempt. Nor did La Stampa's position soften when the Marquis Di San Giuliano was in the post. This was especially the case during the preparations for the Tripoli expedition, a move which Giolitti is known to have undertaken with much reluctance and only after very careful weighing of Italian intelligence estimates of Arab reaction-estimates which turned out to be wide of the mark, but which were also identical with those being sent back from Tripoli to La Stampa by Bevione. In the end, what prompted Giolitti to move into Libya was not the proddings of La Stampa, not those of the national-imperialists of the Idea Nazionale, certainly not those of Albertini's Corriere della sera, but rather the realization that if Italy did not move, France would very likely add Libya to its empire. Frassati's attitude towards Italian foreign policy, from the time of the Zanardelli- Giolitti Ministry at the turn of the century to the outbreak of the First World War is summed up in his daughter's words: "Let's not sell ourselves short" (I, 1:391). It was just this determination to see that Italy not repeat the errors of 1878-1908 that was at the heart of his reaction to the First World War. It is a reaction that will oblige scholars to revise another familiar legend: that Frassati and La Stampa stood fast and firmly for Italy's neutrality. Though it is true that the paper, together with the Italian press generally, backed Salandra's declaration of neutrality when the war broke out, by the winter of 1914-15, following the First Battle of the Marne, when it appeared that the belligerents might come to the conference ascribe a particularist, local attitude to the paper, something Frassati himself opposed from the start and set out to correct, as this new biography will show.</page><page sequence="8">292 Thayer table, leaving Italy "empty handed" once again, Frassati wavered. For a moment, he, too, was an 'interventista."8 Frassati soon concluded, however, that Giolitti had been correct in urging armed and vigilant neutrality, so that Italy might be spared a war whose material costs were evident and whose end could not be foreseen, using its position also to bargain for reasonable territorial adjustments of the frontiers, going to war only when and if the nation's physical defense unmistakenly demanded it. From that moment, Frassati devoted the paper wholeheartedly to a defense of neutrality, to a critique of prowar arguments in editorials matched for clarity and logic only by those of the small group gathered around Croce,9 which included Arturo 8 Of all the labels with which Luciana Frassati was most reluctant to part, that of her father as the purest of the "neutralists" was the hardest to let go. During the several years that I worked with her at her request on this biography, which she had been putting together for many years, when this issue arose only an appeal to Luigi Salvatorelli sufficed to move her, and then only partially. Salvatorelli did not join La Stampa until the war's end, when Frassati, as these pages show, lured him away from his professorship at the University of Naples. But having been the principal foreign policy analyst of the short-lived Italia Nostra, of which Croce was the principal voice, he well knew and agreed that, for a moment, Frassati had wavered. I With this group, Croce published the review Italia Nostra (December 6, 1914-June 6, 1915) in which he criticized the historically based arguments of the "interventionists." The following remarks in recently published letters to Gentile also document Croce's opinions on Giolitti and on Italy's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Naples, 13 May 1915 My Dear Giovanni, . . .What can I say to you about the current situation? You know I am against the war, against it because I believe it would discredit Italy, if not militarily, morally for centuries, and would open a chasm of hatred between it and the Germanic peoples: a hatred we do not deserve. You know I am convinced that the vox populi (and not merely in the material sense of the term, but in its ideal sense) does not want it. . . . Therefore I hope Giolitti's stand will stop us short of the precipice. And I regret only that Salandra has left this act of wisdom to Giolitti. But how can it be that Salandra and Sonnino have not grasped the unhealthy aspects of these incitements to war? The farce at Quarto, with the participation of the prophet D'Annunzio . . . is proof to me that these men do not understand the temper of contemporary Italy, that they mistake the neurasthenia of failed adventurers for ideals and moral vigor.... Naples, 17 May 1915 My Dear Giovanni, Italy's obligations were certainly: 1) to fight on the side of the allies; 2) being unable to do so, to maintain the strictest neutrality. Freeing herself from these obligations, Italy can: 1) profit from the situation of one of the allies in order to ask for what she has always wanted; 2) attack her with arms while she is engaged in a mortal struggle. Now, of these two misdeeds, if one must do one or the other, I prefer the former. And I do so also because it has attenuating features: first, Austria's stupid policy toward Italy; and, secondly, that once the major cause of the disagreement between us is removed, there is the hope that the alliance with the Empires may become more solid. Naturally, of course, the punctum saliens is this: that Italy's interests, that is for the future, lie in a union with the Central Powers, and that (Italy) be ready to help them inma more or less proximate future, even shortly, if not having been able to do so last July. I have a fearful premonition of what is involved in ties that would bind us to a monstrous hotchpotch of disparate cultures and interests such as the Triple Entente. As for Giolitti, I think he did his duty, because he represented the majority of the Parliament, that is of a legally constituted power. Certainly, however, he lacks the moral authority. And that hurts him. He shows a political sense superior to that of Sonnino, But Sonnino is an austere figure, and Giolitti is Giolitti, the man to whom every sort of trickery is attributed, even that of which he</page><page sequence="9">Alfredo Frassati 293 Carlo Jemolo and Salvatorelli, both of whom would later become associated with La Stampa. When the decision of May 1915 was clearly irrevocable, La Stampa became the country's most important expression of the widespread feeling in the Chamber, the Senate, among many high-ranking officers, and certainly among Italians at large, of what was also Giolitti's own wartime position: the necessity for patriotic conduct in a war that was not wanted, save by a minority, which had been thrust upon the country by a diplomacy and a domestic politics that soon revealed their carelessness, deviousness, and ineptitude. In the diatribes of the interventisti, hatred of La Stampa rivalled that shown for Avanti!, whose own statements, and those of the old leadership of the Socialist Party, Frassati tended more and more to defend, in editorials presented here for the first time as they were written, the censored portions restored. As a consequence, the Turin paper was accused of causing the riots that spread through that city and of becoming, alongside Giolitti and the Socialists, a source of that "defeatism" said by the interventisti to have been the real cause of the Caporetto disaster. In Luciana Frassati's running documentary account of the war years, the still obscure incidents of that domestic battle between the minority interventisti and the leaders of the antiwar factions -a struggle that at times verged on civil war and out of which were generated Albertini'-s later accusations that Frassati sought to answer-are described with a vividness born of filial passion: the Prezioso affair; the carefully orchestrated disgrace by Sonnino and Salandra of Camillo Garroni, Italy's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, rehabilitated in the postwar by Giolitti; the debate between Generals Porro and Spingardi over the readiness of the armed forces, the interventisti accusing Spingardi, hence Giolitti in whose Cabinets he served, of having left Italy unprepared for the events of August 1914; the revolution in Italian military and foreign policy that came when General Pollio-one of Frassati's heroes -died and was followed as Chief of General Staff by the virtually unknown and untried Cadorna; the enraged letters of Eduardo Scarfoglio of Naples, circulated among prominent neutralists, attacking Sonnino and the British Empire, a clandestine indictment of the war found among Frassati's papers which will also be familiar to scholars who have read Giolitti's own unpublished correspondence where the Scarfoglio letters appear in copy; and the mysterious "Dalser Affair," Frassati's contacts with Mussolini's abandoned and furious mistress, mother of his illegitimate son, who promised hard evidence that her lover had in fact been in the pay of the French government when he bolted the Socialist Party in 1915 and came out for war. What is largely missing from these first four parts is a discussion and docu- mentation of Frassati's domestic policies in the Giolittian Age. Whereas in earlier drafts of the biography this aspect of La Stampa's position was to have been taken up concurrently with an examination of Frassati' s foreign policy positions, this original plan has been revised, very likely in order to give some linear continuity to this long and profusely detailed biography-history. As a result, readers cannot appreciate fully the influence of domestic political considerations in Frassati's rivalry with prowar interests, nor grasp one of the points Luciana Frassati hoped to make clear above all else: that her father's stand in 1915, unlike so many of those who led the country into the war-and here, never dreams. . . .

By contrast, the Corriere della sera's foreign policy expert, Andrea Torre, whom Albertini had hoped at one time to promote as Foreign Minister, had for years been an ardent backer of the Triple Alliance, along with the Nationalist Party, discovering only in 1914 that it was a relic, a shift of position which was always related to an anti-Giolittian domestic policy, in particular to the claim that Giolitti's handling of politics on the home front was a threat to social-economic stability, a form of "creeping socialism." That the victory of the interventisti in May 1915 was also a domestic political victory is undeniable, and Luciana Frassati's con- tribution to our knowledge of the era will not alter this fundamental fact. Precisely because this is the case, an examination of Frassati's stand on domestic issues should not have been left to the last volume of the work. This is all the more true in that Frassati, who was to become a defender of the Chamber of Deputies and of those parliamentary practices that the war threatened to extinguish, had begun his journalistic career as an enemy of that other per- sonification the interventisti have made fashionable: parlamentarismo. Frassati's early editorials express contempt for the corruption, instability, and danger implicit in the Chamber of Deputies' powers, as these had come to be exercised in fact over the years during which the royalist text of the Statuto of 1848 had been emasculated. Of La Stampa' s views of the parliamentary system during the first years of the Giolittian Age it has been said that the Turin daily, in those years, seemed to be looking for a "man," and for a political program, capable of giving Italian politics a decisive direction, refusing to rely, for such a solution, on the old political establishment which, according to the newspaper, carried with it the inheritance of pork-barrel give-and-take ... and had shown itself confused and unable to deal with the crisis of 1898.10 This assessment is correct, raising again the question of Frassati's real place in the life of Giolitti, which Luciana Frassati, as if chagrined by such evident proofs of the distance that separated the two men for so many years, admits reluctantly to be the fact, writing (in the unpublished portion of the manuscript) that Frassati "saw the issue stripped bare of its parliamentary intricacies. On November 2, 1900, as owner and editor of La Stampa, Frassati published an article that listed the difficulties of parliamentarism . . . finding their cause in the fact that the system that originally had resulted in a balance between King, Chamber and Senate had been altered." In response to what was a very harsh attack on the parliamentary system, Frassati received a letter of praise from Sonnino, expressing full agreement with La Stampa's views and also reminding Frassati that he, Sonnino, had begun his critique of parlamentarismo in his 1897 essay "Torniamo allo Statuto." All this will be made clear in the succeeding volume, which will also show, however, that Frassati's early disparagement of the parliamentary system, part of a widespread analysis of the defects of representative government that made 10 Castronovo, pp. 239-40.</page><page sequence="11">Alfredo Frassati 295 the 1880s and 1890s, in Europe as in the United States, especially fruitful for the production of sociopolitical theory, soon gave way. By 1904-05, Frassati no longer regarded Sonnino as a potential leader. For Giolitti, but also with increasing emphasis for the Socialists, whose side in the days of the general strike La Stampa represented not unsympathetically, criticizing the factory owners for the unpatriotic incitements of lockouts, Frassati came to have high regard. It was here, in the domestic political field, that Frassati first became a follower of Giolitti, while remaining one of his most obdurate critics in the area of foreign policy. In this revolution, Frassati's path recalls that of Pareto, also an enemy during the 1890s of parlamentarismo. Pareto left Italy after an unsuccessful foray into Tuscan politics, fed up with the apparently incurable rottenness of Italian affairs. In Switzerland, but always with an eye on Italy, to which he remained attached, Pareto had predicted the length and enormous costs of the war. When the war was over, and Giolitti reemerged, Pareto saluted the statesman as the living example of the "helmsman," the ideal of the modern prince, in an essay written in April 1921, by which time Pareto had become part of La Stampa's coterie of Giolitti's defenders and critics of his political rivals' conduct of the war."' It was only in late 1919 that between Frassati and Giolitti the lei gave way to the tu. For now the journalist was also a political colleague, part of the world to which the statesman had devoted his own energies. Both men, if one must have a political label, had become social democrats, having seen how heavily the war had fallen on the general bulk of the population and especially-as Giolitti insisted in one of his rare wartime public statements -on the rural populations. This development, which is part of this history of the coming of the war and its aftermath that cannot be separated from the story of the Triple Alliance and related matters, will emerge fully documented in the next and last volume of this important work. There, speaking of this feature of her father's and Giolitti's political outlook, Luciana Frassati has written: La Stampa, owned and run by Alfredo Frassati until it fell into Fascist hands, was independent, as we have seen, of any political power, nor was it ever a party organ. It represented instead the ideals of a multitude of citizens belonging to the most varied classes whose moral and material interests it sought to protect within the context of a free and evolving society. These were ideals and legitimate aspirations that, for the most part, had been cultivated in the modest circle of people who lived by their own labor, remote from the centers of power.... Giolitti was without doubt the first statesman who was more interested in classes than in parties and Frassati the first liberal journalist who, convinced as he was of the necessity of social evolution, raised the issue.... Both of them found themselves in the midst of a cleavage within a traditional world, and both, from their respective positions, preached the patient expectation that liberalism would survive the crisis, taking up again its historic mission of effecting that which was capable of being achieved of its endless revolution. Leaving aside the theory of class war and getting down to the facts, Frassati granted that there were almost enough of these facts in the modern period to justify the Marxists' hope in a historic evolution of the modern age in keeping with their ideas. The very criticism of La Stampa for the baser forms of parlamentarismo turned towards revolutionary socialism and had, as its theoretical motive and practical goal, political reforms that would rejuvenate the machinery of state: a policy, " V.

Frassati was a brilliant and courageously independent journalist and his paper was the expression of his conception of the function of the press in the modern world, a source both of scrupulously accurate information and of a vigorous political commentary aimed at stirring public opinion in support of just such reforms. The reputation of La Stampa was to survive fascism. With the end of the regime, the paper once more became an outlet for journalists distinguished for their dedication to political liberties and for their moral convictions. But there are no "restorations," save in the imagination. Once more it was to be "the cleavage within a traditional world," in this case of the world of Frassati and Giolitti; to which those who had witnessed and participated in the wartime confusion that had generated the forces that revolutionized that society looked back with understandable nostalgia and appreciation of its virtues; to the times when those much-maligned deputies served as the living connection between their constituencies and the Parliament, between that paese legale and the paese reale whose separation was one of the major laments of political theorists, and especially of the interventisti, who claimed that war would bind up these severed members of the body politic. It was also, that older world, a time of independent newspapers, of national journals of opinion, owing allegiance only to their owner's conscience and political convictions. Now, instead, so it seemed to the veterans of La Stampa, deputies were the tools of the Party Secretariat, newspapers the organs of the "mass party."'12 That same nostalgia for and remembrance of an earlier time, and of those who by their actions seem in retrospect to epitomize its virtues, just as their enemies illustrate its latent vices, is the sentiment out of which this documented panorama of the passage of the old world into our own has been written. 12 A.
