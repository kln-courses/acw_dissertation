JUNG AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE CHRISTIAN SYMBOL In what follows I shall recount the polemical strategies whereby the early Christian Apologists sought to establish the unique authenticity of their own biblical-historical revelation, by discrediting rival pagan modes of religious expression and experience-that is, by demeaning and ultimately demonizing myth and the mythogenic unconscious, which Tung held to be the common matrix of all religions and, at the same time, the immanent redemptive agency upon which the vitality and wholeness of the human personality depend. As is well known, lung contended that no seriolls case of neurosis could be resolved except through the subject's recovery of a meaningful religious attitude. In the consulting room, Tung came even- tually to identify an "authentic religious function" reposing within the unconscious depths: an interior locus sacer in which the Divine could be experienced as a native human reality, and the distant deeds of mythological or scriptural record might be re-experienced as expressions of the living process of the TIlt Sa" Francisco lrmg ImtitllU Library JOIIMlol, Vol. 21. No.4. 2003 45 </page> <page sequence="2"> psyche itself. For Tung, the Christian ist01-ia, far from dead, was thus eminently susceptible to being dreamt onward. The evo- lution of the Christian symbol occupied his mind more or less steadily, from his early essays on analytical psychology, through his investigations of alchemical symbolism, comparative my- thology, and the psychological significance of Christian dog- mas, to the later and more prophetically philosophical reflec- tions preserved in such popular collections as Modem Mfl11 ill Search ofa SOlll and The U11discovered Self. A considerable body of his work was dedicated to this possibility, including Answer to Job, which he declared to be the most personally satisfYing ofall his writings. That there exists within the biblical tradition in general, and Christianity in particular, a rooted tendency to disparage or deny the symbol-forming unconscious was, how- ever, a concomitant theme of these studies. Tung's often pal- pable impatience with this psychologically and theologically retrograde tendency haunted his discourse with organized religion (with such contemporary apologists as Buber and White, for example). It was a discourse in which he was ul- timately unsuccessful. Whether in pointing out the secondary status of official Christian creeds and dogmas in relation to the original psychic experiences out of which they have arisen, or in exhorting the Church to some humbling acknowledgment of the mythologi- cal afflatus and continuity of Christian ideas and symbols, Jung was undoubtedly aware that his own archetypal theology stood directly athwart the basic premises of Christian historicism. Writing about the quaternity, for example, lung repeatedly observed that this and other natural symbols of the Divine must be peremptorily disqualified by the defenders of ortho- doxy as "diabolical frauds," insotar as they diverge from a pre- existent and biblically-circumscribed canon of truth. Alchemi- cal, Gnostic, or explicitly pagan symbols, such as ha\'e silted up into Christian consciousness with equal alacrity from a collective unconscious unconstrained by sectarian allegiances, must be similarly consigned to quarantine, even if they are recognizable variants of the immemorial mythic images and motives that everywhere inform Christian doctrine and sacred narrative. Such re\·e1ations from within have always provoked the charges of "mysticism" and "psychologism" that would once again attach themselves to Tung's ideas, since from the Harley ('rice on </page> <page sequence="3"> Church's founding perspective as the custodian of an exclusive and exhaustive historical truth, the mythogenic psyche can add nothing to the closed sum of religious knowledge but a de- monic parody of the Divine. The Western world continues to be, predominantly, both Christian and post-Christian. The "Modern Man," as lung has anatomized him, seems confirmed in his inability to accept traditional religious postulates as literal descriptions of histori- calor supramundane realities, or affirmations of unique and final truths. Whether (as Tung framed the question in The U"discovered Self) a conventionally literal faith-eollectivcly required but wholly deradnated from private experience, and in fatal collision with knowledge-portends the wholesale re- pudiation of Christianity, or the Christian symbol can be psy- chologically and spiritually repotentiated by means of a new interpretation, in terms both of the individual psyche and of collective consciousness and its counterpart, the collective unconscious, the question continues to demand the attention of Jungian thinkers and practitioners. In recent years a number of scholars, as diversely impressive as Vlanov, Stein, Edinger, Dourley, and Corbett, have taken up this foundational theme in analytical psychology. In several important books, Edinger, for example, examines the metaphysical and historical imagery of the Bible in terms of the dynamic encounter between the individuating ego and the transpersonal Self, and posits a new psychological dispensation as a valid successor to a moribund biblical historicism. Dourley restates the case for the psychic interiority of the Divine, and sees in Tung's theory of the origins of all religious symbols in a collective-psychic source, to which individuals continue to have access, the possibility of a saving rclativization ofChristianity's monopolistic certitudes. In a synthesis of Eckhart and Jung, moreover, Dourley pro- poses a possible strategy for a loss of faith, while acknowledg- ing that neither religion nor religious institutions can be made to disappear. Continuing the exploration of the religious func- tion of the psyche, Corbett discerns in its practically infinite capacity to generate images the promise of a new era of per- sonal religion, a religion grounded this time in a direct and individually meaningful relationship with and understanding of the Divine, as neither prescribed by authority nor mediated by traditional religious formulas that scarcely reflect contempo- Mythopocia as Dementia 47 </page> <page sequence="4"> rary knowledge or private experience. Corbett thus reaffirms the intrinsic validity of all religious symbols, regardless of the particular tradition to which thev are attached while admon- . , ishing that psychotherapists, influenced by their own non- religious or anti-religious dispositions, are sometimes prone to discount or disparage their patients' material with potentially injurious consequcnces. Jung's religious point of dew grew partly out of his experiencc of the psyche of his patients, partly out of his encounter with his own mythogenic unconscious. Beyond that, it grew out of his confrontation with what he took to be the ominous failure of the religious tradition into which he was born. lung's knowledge of the origins and history of that tradition was singularly comprehensive; he would certainly have been familiar at some level with almost all of what I am about to relate in thc tollowing pages. The famous charge of "psychologism," as directed at a theology of immediate expe- rience, could only have emerged from a community whose self- defined authenticity was founded upon the disqualification of the psyche, in deference to a literal-historical understanding of revelation and the relationship between the human and the Divine: a community that was and remains closed to the possibility of the evolution of the Christian symbol. In depicting the early stages of the history of that closure, I would theretore like to point out-though this unfortunately cannot be treated in the present anicle-that Jung's opening up of the Christian mind to its own mythological interior was anticipated by similar intimations nearly at the beginning, and certainly at the very core, of the Christian tradition itself. A significant step in this direction occurred by way of Justin Martyr's importation into Christianity of the Hellenistic doc- trine ofan indwelling Logosspermatikoswhich, according to the Apologist, had from all eternity shed the seeds of religious knowledge directly into the psychic depths of men of every ancient race and nation, Gentile and barbarian alike-thus effectively circumventing the entire biblical economy of Incar- nation and Sacrifice, understood as historical events. Justin's adaptation of this originally Stoic theory of an archetypal psychic re\'dation nor only relari\'ized sectarian Christian claims to embody an exclusive and final truth, but anticipated lung's own hypothesis of the collective psychic origins, and 48 Harley Price on </page> <page sequence="5"> therefore the universality, of religious symbols and ideas. Simi- larly Clement's (and thereafter Augustine's) Orpheo-Platonic vision of the otherworldly pre-existence and nature of the soul collapsed the radical distance benveen the human and Divine, and thus logically refused to be subsumed within the frame- work of the biblical anthropology and salvation history, but reasserted itself all the more forcefully from a pre-Christian mythic underworld. Above all, Origen's radical and systematic dissolution ofthe biblical isto1·ia into allegory (i.e., into mythic symbol) deposited within the tradition an influence that, while officially resisted, could never be nullified. There is, it seems to me, a direct line of access from Jung's theory of archetypes to Origen's insistence upon the reality of an aprioristic and eternally recurrent Incarnation and Resurrection unfolding in the Archetypal Psyche, in which the soul of every man directly participates, and to which the "mere history" of the biblical Jesus points as a self-transcending symbol. Origen's exegetical imperative of withdrawing from historical projection every scriptural event and personality so that it may be recapitulated in the spiritual life of the contemporary Christian believer seems no less amenable to the basic principles of Jungian hermeneutics, according to which the ultimate referents of religious statements and images are not distant and external historical exemplars, but the eternally resurgent contents and dynamisms of the psychic here and now. It was the epochal message of Jung's archetypal theology that a nvo-thousand-year-old historical insult need no longer be determinative. Nor was it determinative, if I may say so, in the spiritual and intcllectuallives ofsome of the most venerable early and medieval Christian thinkers who, while c1eaving- perhaps because of cleaving-consciously to the finalistic his- torical pretensions of Christian orthodm..y, became the vessels of a great flood of archaic mythic materials and energies upon which the modern-day Christian or non-Christian may well, if he choooses, reconstitute his own religious personality. The early Christian Apologists, Church Fathers, and scriptural poets preserved for the contemplation of the Christian devout the entire late-antique pagan legacy of Homeric, Pythagoreo- Orphic, Platonic, and Stoic myths about the nature of the Divine, the origins of the world and man, and the salvation of the soul, if only by affecting to discover them allegorically Mythopoeia as Dementia 49 </page> <page sequence="6"> in (i.e., by reading them into) the Bible. In this way, an ever- resurgent archetypal psyche worked, through men who were officially committed to its abolition, to compensate and ulti- mately transform the simplicity of biblical Christianity into a complex of two autonomous and antithetical theologies and soteriological methods. It may give some encouragement to those dedicated to the prospect of the evolution of the Chris- tian symbol to know that the entire history of Christianity, beginning with the episode I am about to describe, seems only to demonstrate the inevitability of the old Heraditean reflex of emmtiodromiflJ as Tung's psychology has taught us to un- derstand it. 2. CHR.lSTIAN AUTHENTICITY AND THE POLEMIC AGAINST MYTH Pflgatl;sm as a CTFalse:D Theology. P1"elimillary C01JSideratiotlS The logical chasm that, in the Western mind, sundered the opposites of truth and falsehood has revealed itself from the earliest times in the distinction between history and myth. In the West, these ostensibly "literary" categories are so closely articulated with the most fundamental antinomies of ontology and epistemology that in popular speech to call a thing a myth is to deny its very existence (as to call it historical is to affirm its reality and truth). It is necessary, then, to remind ourselves that the genres of mythos and istoria were not always and everywhere so rigorously opposed. As Heinrich Zimmer has observed, there is little explicit difference between history and myth in the religious cultures of India and the Far East, where the spheres of objective reality and subjective experience more closely approximate one another. (Heinrich Zimmer. Myths atld Symbols in bldiatl Art and Civilizatioll. Joseph Campbell, ed. New York, Bollingen Foundation, 1946, passim.) Indeed, in ancient Greece, where the logical principle of non-contra- diction was born, even Aristotle refused to dispose of history and myth in accordance with the now traditional antitheses, arguing as he did in the Poetics that in a multiplicity of senses a fiction could be truer than a fact. But, in the early Christian era, there was little overt in- terest in the redemptive possibilities of myth. The early Chris- tian polemic against pagan religion was, in essence, a polemic against mythopoeia and the imaginative psyche that was rec- ognized as its source. The Apologists attributed the genesis of 50 Harley Price on </page> <page sequence="7"> the myths to a species of dementia: while they ascribed the biblical narratives to the providential inspiration of God, the myths, they said, were the offspring of demonic suggestion. For centuries the Christian attack on the pagan gods moved back and forth amongst what had become, within the first generation of Christian apologetics, ubiquitous rhetorical commonplaces: the gods were impossibly immoral; they were hapless victims of capricious and undignified passions; in their theriomorphism they were aptly revealed to be no better than beasts; the most venerable amongst them were child-eaters, parricides, posthumously aggrandized men, apostate angels in Satanic declension, mute manufactures of stone and wood, or the insensate clements ofa fallen and God-forsaken nature. To the early Christians, these sorry truths indicated that either the Homeric narratives that so depicted the gods were myths (i.e., falsehoods), or the gods themselves were myths (non-existent). According to Athenagoras, the pagan devout had but two rational choices: if the traditional, scandal-ridden portraits of the gods were false, then the Greeks were in thrall to poetic deceptions; if true, then the beings worshipped by the Greeks might have in fact existed, but were anything but divine. (Athenagoras, Legatio xxx, 4) To the Christian critics of the mythic theology of antiq- uity, it was not obviously mitigating that the indignation they hurled against the pagan gods was recycled indignation. Every one of the contra paganos arguments had come out of pagan arsenals: from the Pre-Socratic philosophers and commenta- tors Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, Xenophanes, Theogenes of Rhegium, Metrodorus, and Prodicus, from the Cynic Diogenes, from Plato, from the Stoics Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus, from the late-antique polymaths Cicero, Sextus Empiricus, Lucian, Palaephatus, Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Crates, Apollodorus, Cornutus, Dio Chrysostom, Plutarch, the Pseudo-Plutarch, Maximus of Tyre, and Celsus. It might be said that the paganism early Christianity set about to condemn and conquer was a phantom paganism: a religion that, when its mythic statements were interpreted literal- istically, was indeed as crude and primitive as Christians al- leged, but one that by the time of Jesus had already been discredited, and effectively ceased to be practiced. The pagan theologians had themselves long ago conceded Mythopocia as Dementia 51 </page> <page sequence="8"> the anhistoricity of the gods. Unlike the accounts of the Yahwist and the Deuteronomist in the Hebrew Bible, which stood for a thousand and six hundred years respectively before Philo arose to question their literal veracity, large tracts of the Homeric and Hesiodic writings were rejected as history very soon after they had coalesced into the literary corpus that in classical civilization came as ncar as anything to what might be called an official religious "canon." By the sixth century BCE, philosophers, theologians, and poets alike were enlisted into a tragi-comic chorus lamenting the scandalous injuries suffered by-because of the scandalous misdeeds falsely attributed to- the gods of Olympus. According to Xenophanes, because of their rank inability to conceive the Divine apart from images derived from their own experience, both Homer and Hesiod had grievously misled men into believing "that the gods are begotten, and that they wear clothing like our own, and have a voice and a body." (Xenophanes, Frag. 3. 34, in John ~1ansley Robinson. A" bttrod1lcti011 to Ear~y Greek Pbilosophy. Boston, Houghton Mimin, 1968, p. 52) In atonement for his anthropomorphic depictions of the gods, Homer is reported by Pythagoras to have been consigned to hell. (See the tradi- tion recorded by Diogenes Laertius, "Pythagoras," in Lives of Emi"C1It Philosophers.) Such immoral, changeable, impossibly corporeal, creamrdy, and generally fallible divinities as the ancestral poets had imagined, the Greek critics concluded, could not possibly exist in any literal or historical sense; indeed, if the supernal dignity of the Divine was to be saved, then the historicity of the Olympian gods was to the pagan theologians a trifling sacrifice. Though the ancestral narratives were preserved and cher- ished, it was certainly not as records of empirical actualities or historical events. Greek antiquarians and rhetoricians contin- ued down through Christian times to scrutinize the Homeric chronicle of Troy in order to perfect their analytical skills in separating historical fact from the rubble of poetic fiction. The poets salvaged Homer-unconquerably venerable as the Homeric legends had become-for moral didacticism. Platonists and Stoics, while deriding any vestigial pretensions that Homer's gods might exist in some literal sense, discovered in him an ingenious cosmogonist, natural theologian, meta- physician, or ethicist, whose deep doctrines, appropriately 52 Harley Price; on </page> <page sequence="9"> occulted from the vulgar under a veil of allegory, often cyni- cally resembled their own. Yet never did the pagan rejection of the Homeric narratives as history entail a rejection (as in the contra paganos polemic of the early Christians) of the deeper truth and value of myth. In the critical ethos of post- Homeric paganism, the idea that the hieros logos was not an historical factum but a symbolic fiction-ultimately more meaningful and true-was born; and the mythic theology of classical and late antiquity was accordingly detined. It was this idea, that a "false" (mythic) theology could be a valid vehicle for the expression of the Divine and a valid economy for the salvation of the soul, that Christianity repu- diated, as decisively as it repudiated the more atavistic absur- dities and superstitions of pagan religion. Accordingly, pagan allegory, which for the ancients served to redeem the dignity of the supreme God from the calumnies inflicted upon Him by the popular gods ofmyth, was to the earliest Christians but another theological scandal (even though biblical exegetes from the time of Philo onward would permit themselves to borrow the arguments of the ancient critics of Homer against a mutable and crudely anthropomorphic God-image, and apply them to recalcitrant passages in both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, arriving in the process at the same judg- ment about the historical pretensions of the Scriptures as pagan interpreters had once pronounced against the Homeric Ic::gends). Though in confronting the Bible's literal difficulties a number of Christians, Origen pre-eminently among them, would approach the biblical narratives from the allegorical posture of a mythic theologian, early Christianity radically differentiated its theology from the mythological idioms of late-antique paganism. Not only did the earliest Christians deny that the life of Jesus was a myth, or that the Gospel accounts incorporated ancient and Widespread mythological elements, but they set about to condemn an incumbent pa- ganism simply on the basis of its anhistorical character. In so doing, they proceeded to establish as a rudimentary principle, in defiance of the ancient pagan habitude, that for a religion to be authentic, it must be grounded neither in the symbolic fictions of poetry nor the inner revelatio of the imaginative Mythopocia as Dementia 53 </page> <page sequence="10"> psyche that incubated them, but in actual, empirically verifi- able, historical events. History as Tr"th; Myth as Falsehood. Defi1litions ofMythos and Istoria i1l the Pagan Rhetoricians of the Second Century CE The opposing poles of istoria and mythos thus rapidly crystallized in Christian polemical consciousness as the defin- ing idioms of biblical and pagan religion. It is another of the ironies emerging out of the co,zt1'a paganos writings that the earliest Christians borrowed their definitions of these genres from the ancients themselves. In sifting through the literary patrimony of classical and Hellenistic Greece, the late-antique grammarians normally identified history and myth as the basic categories of narrative. In his early second-century treatise Progymnasmata, the Alexandrian rhetorician Aelius Theon defined istoria as a "narrative which relates events that actually took place," and mythos as a "false account imaging truth (logos pseudes eikonizon alethia,z).)J (See Leonardus Spengel, ed., Rhetores Graeci, Leipzig, Teubner, 1854, II, 78.15; 70.21; 72. 28.) But in the pagan imagination, where mythic falsehood merged seamlessly into allegorical truth, the opposition be- tween history and myth had neither the moral nor the theo- logical import it would assume in Christianity. One indication of the blurring of the two categories was the fact that many of the second-century grammarians treated myth as a subset of historical narrative. Asclcpiadcs, for ex- ample, posited three types of history: true, or factual; false, or mythical; and "truth-like" (a classification that included com- edy and mime). Amongst false histories, Asclepiades further differentiated the sub-genres of mythoi and plasmata ("'fic- tion"). (Ap. Sextus Empiricus. AdverstlS Mathematicas, 1. 252- 53) Sextus Empiricus affected to distinguish between a myth and a fiction when he enumerated the species of narrative as follows: 1) history, an account ofwhat did take place; 2) myth, an account ofwhat could not have taken place; and 3) fiction, an account of what could have but did not take place. (Ibid., 263-64) (Here again, the late-antique concept of fiction seems to depend upon Aristotle's celebrated definition of the poet's art in the ninth chapter of the Poetics: "It is not the function of the poet to describe what has actually happened [the tunc- tion of the historian] but the kinds of things that might happen ... because they are either probable or necessary.") 54 Harley Price: on </page> <page sequence="11"> Ultimately, late-antique attempts to differentiate fiction from myth involved the sorts of over-subtilized calculations that, to such as Cicero, had made of rhetoric an occasion for exercising the muscles of derision (see Cicero's recurrent animadversions on rhetorical punctilio throughout his De !tzlJetlti01ze, De Oratore, and De Natura Deorlmz); thus in practice the terms myth and fiction were virtually interchange- able. When the second-century Middle Platonist philosopher Celsus derogated the Gospels by maintaining that they were replete with myths and fictions, the distinction inherent in his double insult was apparently unclear to Origen, who answered (in the certainty that he had therewith refuted Celsus' argu- ment) merely that the Christian narratives were not plasmata. (Origen, C01Ztra Celmm. III, xxvii) The defining quality of both fiction and myth remained that they were at least super- ficially "false": that is, they described entities and events that did not exist in the empirical order of space and time. Plato accordingly referred to the philosopher's fancy of the perfectly governed city as a "fictioned myth» (Timaetls 26 e) in contrast to the historical city of Athens ("a fact and not a ftctioned myth"), whereafter the phrase to "fiction a myth" became a commonplace. (Cf. Theon, Progymn. [Spengel], II, 75.11; Palaephatus, De bzcredibile, passim; Philo, Exsecr. 162; Origen, Commenta7j' on Matthelv XVIII, xxx.) Mythos in Earty Christiatz Usage When the earliest Christians undertook to demonstrate the unique truth of their theological doctrines, and to differ- entiate the biblical revelation as a record of actual events from the mendacious fantasies of the pagan poets, they naturally had recourse to the rhetorical distinctions they had learned from their late-antique Greek schoolmasters. Though the word mythos does not occur in either the Gospels or the book of Acts, it appears as early as the Pastoral Epistles (late first century), in the context of their characteristic concern with preserving the purity of orthodox belief. The author of Titus (1: 14) rebukes the false teachings of the Christian Judaizers as mythoi, reminding us that in its nascency Christian Truth needed to be emancipated from the incumbent errors of Hebrew as well as pagan religion. The sole occurrence of the word in the Apostolic Fathers is found in a variation of Ignatius' Letter to the Magnesians 8, where the "strange doc- Mythopoeia as Dementia 55 </page> <page sequence="12"> trines and antiquated 11lytlmmlata:D of the Jews are similarl\' condemned. In I Timothy (4: 7; cf. also II Tim. 4: 4) th~ heresies that would in the "latter times" cause Christians to depart the path of truth are called "old wives' mythoi,:D and are ascri bed (l: 1) to the machinations of "seducing devils." (In the apologetic writings the demonic authorship of the Greek myths would become a recurrent theme of the c01lt1'a pagfl110S polemic.) The single biblical instance in which the word mythos appears to refer, not to the doctrinal deviations of Christians themselves, but to the fallacious narratives of the ancient pagan poets, is tound in I Tim. 1: 4, where its conjunction with the word gmealogies ("Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies ...") recalls a conventional ddinition of mythos (i.e., "genealogies of gods and heroes") frequently rehearsed by the late-antique rhetoricians. (E.g., Asclepiades ap. Sextus Empiricus, AdJ'CI'SIIS Mathematicos I, 252-53) Though Judaizing and Hellenizing heresies including Montanism and Gnosticism would continue to be dismissed as "myths" by such defenders of orthodoxy as Hippolytus and Irenaeus, the meaning of the term was gradually narrowed by the Apologists to denominate the ancient poetic falsehoods about the pagan gods, from which the truthful record of the Bible was rigorously distinguished. Athenagoras wields the term myth, like the ancient Homeric critics before him, as a comprehensive indictment of popular pagan religion: with it he disqualifies the gods not only for the impossibility, but also the immorality, corporeality, and anthropomorphism of their nature and actions, concluding, as noted above, that if the poetic slanders against them are rejected as falsehoods (as even the pagans had rejected them), then the gods of myth must not exist, and ifproved to be true, then what the poets describe are not the deeds of gods but of some considerably lesser beings. (Leg. xxx, 4) Thus, true or false, the mythic idiom, according to Athenagoras, effectively annihilates the divinities of pagan religion. From such non-existent or diminished entities Athena- goras is confident he can distinguish the True God of biblical history and theology ("For we do not come to our views on either God the Father or his Son as do the poets, who create myths in which they present the gods as no better than men"). (Leg. x, 2 )Tatian issues a general warning about "mendacious poets, who by their fictions beguile their hearers from truth" 56 Harley I'rice 011 </page> <page sequence="13"> (Oratio xxii), and contrasts the Christian teaching on the Resurrection, for instance, with the "mythic tales" which entrust the Final Judgment to Minos and Rhadamanthys (Oratio vi; cf. Athenagoras, Leg. xii, 4) Similarly, Theophilus recommends to antiquarians of the Deluge the historical re- liability of the Mosaic accounts: "He tells no myth about a Pyrrha or a Deucalion ..." (Ad Autolyellln Ill, xviii) In distinguishing biblical-historical truth from mythic falsehood, the Apologists thus, ironically, uncovered a network of intersections between them. Justin Martyr was the earliest Christian to note a comprehensive parallelism between the ancient myths and Christian sacred history, though often merely in order to append the qualitication that only the latter was "to be believed" because it was "true." (I Apology xxiii) In the same way Tatian, while acknowledging that Apollo's theophany as a lowly shepherd anticipates the Christian doc- trine of a God who condescended to appear on earth in the form of a man, nonetheless reminds his pagan readers that the stories about Apollo and all the other ur-Christs he identifies from pagan mythology arc only "idle tales." (Oratio xxi) In the early Christian age, this analogy with a difference remained an obligatory topos of Greek and Latin apologetics, as Chris- tians conceded that their sacred narratives were in a multiplic- ity ofways similar to the pagan myths, without confessing that they were in any sense "mythological." 3. THE MYTHOGENIC PSYCHE AS DEMONIC Dreams, bnaginatioll, and the Dailn011 Within "It is to dreams," wrote Tertullian, "that the majority of mankind owe their knowledge of God." (De Allima xxvii, 2, quoted in E.R. Dodds. Pagan and Ch,·istian in all Age of Allxiety. New York, W. W. Norton, 1970, p. 38, on which parts of the following discussion depend.) Long before mod- ern psychology it was understood that the fruits of religious belief hang upon a tree rooted in the unconscious. But Tertullian credited dreams as direct and trustworthy commu- nications from God only so long as they revealed again the same god as had once revealed Himself in the historical events of Scripture; the dreams that inspired the ancient poets to confabulate, or were continuing to inspire novel Christian theologies, he warned, were sent by evil demons. Demonizing the inner world of the mythogenic imagina- M~'thopoeia as Dementia 57 </page> <page sequence="14"> tion (the unconscious as we now call it) was the natural reflex of an historical faith that identified truth with empirical events toward which only an extraverted consciousness can turn. Paganism, which typically encountered and expressed a sense of the sacred and the Divine through the medium of poetic fancy, or in a metaphysical Reality that is essentially psychic (the Idea, as Plato with pregnant ambiguity called it), discov- ered in the daimonic mediations of the unconscious a redemp- tive benignity. The first Greek philosopher Thalcs, as Athenagoras writes, "presents God as the Mind of the world, but regards daimons as psychic substances (daimonas de otlsias poei psychikas)." (Leg. xxiii, 4) One implication of this doctrine, as interpreted and elaborated in the late-antique doxographies, was that the gods are naturally and from the beginning resident potencies within the human psyche. Greek philosophy thus began from a position consistent with the one to which ana- lytical psychology has in etfect returned: the understanding that though the gods of myth may appear to consist in, or reveal themselves through external entities or events, they are rooted in innate and aprioristic psychic dynamisms and pro- cesses (in other words, "archetypes"). In antiquity, the daimons were typically comprehended as those immanent and intermediary aspects of an otherwise tran- scendent and inaccessible Godhead. As Diotima instructs Socrates, Everything that is daimonic is intermediate between the Divine and mortal . . . The daimons interpret between gods and men, conveying prayers and sacrifices to the gods and carrying back the benefices they return. The daimons are mediators who span the chasm which divides the human and Divine, ... and to them the arts ofthe prophet and priest, their sacrifices and mysteries and charms, and all revelation and incantation, are assigned. For God has no direct contact with man; only through the daimonic is there intercourse and conversation between men and gods, whether in the waking state or during sleep. And the man who is expert in such intercourse is a daimonic man, compared with whom the experts in arts or handi- eratts are but journeymen. (Sympositlm 202 e-203 a) In his commentary on this famous text, Apuleius tells us that in their role as "messengers" and "interpreters" the daimons have been charged by the gods with the responsibility to inspire in men all sorts of psychic and religious experiences: 58 Harley Price on </page> <page sequence="15"> revelations, prophecies, visions of the future, dreams (of the revelatory and admonitory type), and so on. (De Dca Socratis vi) According to Synesius (late antiquity's most revered au- thority on dreams, prophecy, poetic inspiration, and most othcr psychic phenomena), the human imagination is the natural habitat of thc daimons, no less than any far-off Olympus. Indeed, whatever thoughts or images men conceive with regard to the Divine have their birth, in Synesius' opin- ion, from a teeming, psychic kingdom of daimons within: Whole races of daimons have their existence in such a realm as this . . . For . . . in the case of man most things come by imagination and that alone, ... for we do not form thought-concepts without imagination. . . . . . The life in question [the dream life] is founded on imagination ... This envelope of soul-matter, which the happy have called the enveloping soul, is in tum god, daimon of every sort, and phantom, ... for the oracles are agreed about this, to wit, the similarity of the soul's way of life in another world to the imaginings of the dream condition. (De blso11miis v) Ernst Curtius has describcd the transparency and imme- diacy of the unconscious underworld that survived beneath the intellectual veneer of late-antique paganism: how the daimons of dream and vision reliably reintroduced by night the gods who had supposedly been put to flight in the daylight of reason: They peopled the psychological cosmos of late Antiquity: sibyls, tutelary spirits, demons, supernatural redeemers and noxious creatures . . . Often we think that we are moving through a hallucinated world, through a world of waking dreams. Visions and dreams have immense power over men in this period. The world of the antique gods is repudiated by enlightened pagans. But it rises again in dreams. In a discussion of religion which dates from the end of the second or from the third century, the repre- sentative of paganism lCaecilius ] admits to a Christian: "Even in sleep we sec, hear, and know the gods whom by day we impiollsly repudiate, reject, and offend by our forswearing." (Ernst Robert Curtius. E"ropeall Literature alld the Latin Middle Ages. Willard R. Trask, tr. Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1973, p. 102. Reference is to Minucius Felix, O,tav;"s \'ii, 6.) (In much the same way, it might be said in prospect, the M}"thopocia as Demenria 59 </page> <page sequence="16"> nocturnal demons that Christ had cast out, in such heroic gestures as are recorded in biblical and post-biblical Christian tradition, inevitably returned by way of the daimonic imagi- nation described by Synesius and Minucius' pagan rcpresenta- tive: in patristic theology and biblical exegesis, and in medieval Christian poetry, mythography, and commentary on the clas- sics, where reactivated pagan doctrines and images wcre only preemptorily Christianized.) Replacing the old pagan understanding that the daimonic (Divine) has its natural seat in the human psyche with a view that expels the Deity into a sphere remote in time (history) or place (a heaven cut otf from the fallcn world of the human soul), Christianity cmphasized the talsity and defectiveness of the human imagination. Psychic images werc scen now, not as revelations inspired by some innate divine presence, but sec- ondary and dcrivative "likencsscs," poor imitations of an ex- ternal, empirical reality. Aquinas, for instance, emphasizcd the unreliability of the imagination in the De Veritate: Now falsity is attributed to imagination, because it pre- sents the likeness even of absent things; so that when a person turns to the likeness of the things, this apprehcn- sion gives rise to falsity. Hence too Aristotle says that shadows and pictures and dreams are said to be false as being insubstanriallikenesses. (De Verirnte, q. 17, art. 2, resp. 2) Idolatry, which in ancient Hebrew and early Christian polemic is the stereotypically culpable idiom of mythic theol- ogy, was a notorious example, according to Aquinas, of the deceptions of imagination. The idol-maker's image, Aquinas said, is a t~llse double of God, who is a perfect Unity by definition. "In this sense idols are called 'falsehoods: opposite to the divine truth, because false opinion concerning idols is the contrary of true opinion concerning the unity ofGod." (De Vel·.) q. 17, art. 4, rcsp. 3) Imagination, dreaming, and idol- making are all counterteiters' arts; they yield merely duplex and duplicitous copies of an original reality-44myths," as Theon defIned them: false sayings copyillg/imagillg tmth. But then, the imperfection of these psycho-mythic images was nevcr so disqualifYing to pagans as it was to Christians. As Synesius had said, man cannot think but "by imagination alone"-cven if the human imagination is constitutionally 60 Harley Price un </page> <page sequence="17"> flawed. The daimon-ridden imagination of the poets, admits the Middle Platonist Apuleius, gives us a defective represen- tation of the Divine, swarming with projections from the human sphere: It is from this collection of daimons that the poets gen- erallv select their characters when ... they give a fictitious pict~re of the gods as haters or lovers of particular men: when they represent them as raising some people to pros- perity and bringing to others frustrations and affliction. Hence the gods are shown feeling pity and indignation, anguish, joy, and every facet of human emotion; being subject, like men, to such agitation of the heart and turmoil in the mind they arc tossed about on the stormy waters of the poets' imaginations. All these squalls and tempests banish them far away from the tranquillity of heaven. (De Deo Soc. xii; cf. Justin, II Apol. ,,) Apuleius, like many other pagan theologians contempo- rary with him, sought to withdraw those crude analogies to human experience that had betouled the popular Homeric portrait of divinity-asking us to see the myths as only pro- visional symbols of the Divine-and then to elevate the "true gods" (ineffable essences, without beginning or end, removed from all contact with matter, subject to neither passion nor want) to a supramundane dwelling-place of complete and unassailable "felicity." There the genuine divinities, as Plato conceived them (as opposed to the gods of popular myth), were thought by Apuleius to float in absolute transcendence above a "gulf" across which there could be no "direct inter- course" with men. (De Deo Soc. iii-iv) Given this unbridgeable divide, however, the daimons, and the daimon-possessed imagination of the poets, became all the more indispensable as mediators between man and God. It was the Christian Apologists who revised the West's opinion about the "daimonic man"-revered in antiquity as the inrrovert alertly tuned to the frequencies of the psychic inner world-pronouncing him "demonic" in the popular sense. Socrates had consistently regarded the inner promptings of his personal daimollion as a source of spiritual grace, a spur ofmoral conscience, and a benevolent guiding hand. Through- out the De Natttra Deortmt, Cicero plainly counred Socrates' daimon a permanent live-in god, and Socrates (thus blessed), a god-man. But Tertullian eventually declared an "evil spirit" Mythopoci:a :as Dementia 61 </page> <page sequence="18"> the daimon that "attached to him from the days of his child- hood, to hold him back from the path of goodness." (Apol. xxii, 1) It is Augustine, as we would expect, who gives us the settled Christian opinion of the daimons: For our part, we abide by the language ofScripture, which is the basis of our Christian belief. And there we read of good and bad angels, but never of good demons. In tact, wherever this name is found in the books of the Bible, whether in the form of daimolles or in the form daimo1lia, it always refers to malignant spirits. And this way ofspeak- ing has been so generally adopted, that e\'en among those who arc called pagans, who maintain that it is right to worship many gods and demons, scarcely anyone would be so literary and pedantic as to bring himself to say, even to his slave, by way of a compliment, "You are possessed of a demon." He would know, without a shadow of a doubt, that if he decided to say this to anyone it would inevitably be taken as a deliberate insult. (Civitas Dei IX, xix) But, of course, Augustine is here conveniently fathering on paganism his own Christian aversion to the daimons. Refuting the Platonists, Augustine warned against court- ing the psychic daimons on the assumption that their "media- tion" will assure one's reconciliation with the Deity: "Such a man [Plato's daimoniac] might suppose that he would be able to enter into fellowship with the gods after death; but in fact he would find himself in the toils of malignant spirits, the victim of their deception." (Civ. Dei X, ii) Arising out of the subjective fantasies of the poetic imagination, rather than the observation of external historical facts, the pagan myths, Augustine said, could only have been inspired by deceitful demons, who "rejoice ... in the blasphemous, outrageous, criminal fictions of the poets" (Civ. Dei X, i), of whose lies, as Justin Martyr had first pointed out, they arc the secret authors. The demons who intlamed the imaginations of the poets were indeed, in Justin's view, the ghost-writers (pun intended) ofpagan mythology. They concocted the myths only after eavesdropping on the typological predictions of the Jew- ish Prophets; misunderstanding them, or deliberately distort- ing them to lead men astray, they then contrived stories about Perseus, Bellerophon, Mercury, Orpheus, Hercules, Bacchus, Asclepius, et al., which were &lt;:lever simulacra of the history of 62 Harley Price on </page> <page sequence="19"> Christ. (E.g., I Apol. xxi-xxiii, liv; but this is a recurrent theme throughout Justin's works.) All of pagan mythology was thus an idol: a false and derivative double of biblical-historical Truth. The Psycho~mythic Image as Idol In the opinion of the earliest Christians, then, dreams, imagination, mythology, and idolatry were related phenom~ ena, all inspired by "seducing devils." The regnant view of the Apologists was that temple images were certainly not inhabited by gods from whom emanated salubrious psychic influences (inspirations, prophecies, visions, oracles, and other divinatory counsels), as was the age-old attitude of paganism (cf. Plutarch, De De! Orac. xiii [417 A]; Apuleius, De Deo Soc. vi; Celsus ap. Origen, Contra Celstlm VIII, Ix; the Pseudo- Apuleius, Asclepitts xxxvii), but were "usurped" (as Athenagoras charged) by demonic impostors (Leg. xxiii). In this way the demons, "by signs and wonders," as Tertullian explained, brought about "faith in their own divinity." (Apol. xxi, 31) The Apologists could not resist the temptation thereby to equate, as Aquinas would do after them, the false concep- tions of the human imagination with the evil effects produced by idols. Of course, the above-mentioned temptation was made more irresistible by the ambiguity in this instance of the Greek language: i.e., eidolon could mean both an idol (a statue of the gods) and a mental "image" or "idea." Thus, in the words of Athenagoras, "These movements of the soul not directed by reason but by fantasy give birth to illusory im- ages"-where images is here a deliberate and morally charged dOtlble-mtendre (as Athenagoras reveals when he continues): When the soul is weak and docile, ignorant and unac- quainted with sound teachings, unable to contemplate the truth ... the demons . . . because they are greedy for the savour of fat and the blood of sacrifices ... take hold of these deceitful movements in the souls of the many, and by invading their thoughts flood them with illusory images which seem to come from the idols and statues. (Leo. xxvii; on the demonic inspiration of idolatry, sec Justin Martyr, I Apol. ix.) Minucius Felix tells us similarly that it is their ghoulish craving for the "reck of altars and the sacrifice of beasts" that incites the demons to these acts of psychic contagion, and Mythopocia as Dementia 63 </page> <page sequence="20"> "ignorance" that makes porous the minds of their victims, (OCtJJll, xxvii, 8; xxvii, 2) Although Arnobius denies it (Adver- SItS Natiolles VII, iii), the demons' need for the nourishment of sacrificial gore is, in the formulations of Tatian, Justin, Tertullian, and the Pseudo-Clement, an apt symbol of the gross carnality of their nature, which is in turn related to the rank sensuality of the poetic imagination. (Cf. Tatian 0,., xv- xvi; Justin, II Apol, v; Tertullian, Apol. xii, 6; Pseudo-Clement, Recogllitiom IV, xvi, xviii.) Like Athenagoras, Minucius Felix credits the demons with the ability to throw off images that seem at once to animate the lifeless pagan idols and take possession of the onlooker's soul. The demons "lurk in hiding beneath consecrated statues and images," and by their "spiritual influence" they gain authority equal to that of the resident god. (Octal'. xvii, I) Haunting shrines, they suggest prophecies to seers "and pro- duce oracles enveloped in a multitude of lies," (Octav. xxvii, I) Tertullian acknowledges that the prophecies and oracular admonitions issued by the demons are on occasion correct. Being winged, they can be almost anywhere in the world within moments, and so provide reconnaissance of things otherwise unknowable. Their knowledge of future events, however, is typically plagiarized from the predictions of the Hebrew Prophets, whence they pretend to the clairvoyant powers of the Almighty. (Apol. xxii, 8-9; on God's sufferance of the demons' ability "even sometimes to speak the truth," cf. Ps.-Clemenr, Recognitiolls IV, xxii.) Athenagoras has a simpler explanation for the demons' uncanny precognizance: they merely take credit to themselves for all the "remarkable things," such as foretelling the future, "which the soul . . , brings about in a l'atiomtl way of itself." (Leg. xxvii, 2, my underscore; on the unusual early Christian meaning of "rationality," see below.) M.:vthopoeia as Demmtin The theory of the demonic inspiration of the myths was certainly a sensational way for the Apologists to dismiss, as a species of irrationality bordering on dementia, the mythic imagination and the unconscious processes that have ever fertilized it, With a clinical thoroughness, the Apologists spoke of the dreams and fantasies that gave rise to the mythic the- ology of paganism in the sometimes macabre language of Harlc}' Pricc on </page> <page sequence="21"> psychopathology. Tatian describes how the demons/gods "invade" the minds and bodies of certain persons, "producing a sense of their presence by dreams." (Or. )..-viii) What the ancients would have taken to be the blessing of theophany or enthtlsiasmos is for the Apologists the curse of mental illness. According to Tatian, the "scenic representations" limned by invading demon-muses, for poets stupidly grateful for such inspiration, entirely "pervert the mind." (Or. xvi) In the Rec- ognitions of the Pseudo-Clement, the demonically inspired are said to be plagued by "thoughts" and "suggestions" that are then falsely assumed to be the "perceptions of their own souls;" indeed, the poetic madness or melancholy that was conventionally attributed to an excess of "phlegm" or "gall" is in reality a symptom of demonic visitation. (Recog. IV, xviii) Tenullian explains how the demons effect "dread derange- ments of the mind" by a "mysterious power of infection" which he likens to some airborne pestilence that invisibly blights flowers and crops. (Apol. xxii, 5-7) Minucius Felix confirms that, "being subtle spirits, they secretly creep into our bodies, contriving diseases, terrifying our minds, and wrench- ing our limbs." The demons' sin is then only compounded when they depart their Victims, taking their assorted pathogens with them, and thereafter advertising their humanitarian claims to be able to cure the halt and the insane. (Octav. xxvii, 2) Tatian explains their imposture as follows: The demons do not cure, but by their art make men their captives. And the most admirable Justin has rightly de- nounced them as robbers. For, as it is the practice ofsome to capture persons and then to restore them to their friends for a ransom, so those who are esteemed gods, . . . when they have taken their fill of the things of this world, flyaway from the sick, and, destroying the disease which they had produced, restore men to their former state. (Or. xviii) When contemporary demoniacs are exorcised, Theo- philus observes, the depotentiated spirits often confess to being the same demonic intruders as anciently ventriloquized the entire corpus of Greek mythology: Inspired by demons and puffed up by them, they [the poets) said what they said through them. For such poets as Homer and Hesiod, inspired as they say by the Muses, Mythopocia as Dementia 65 </page> <page sequence="22"> spoke out of imagination and error ... This is clearly proved by the fact that up to the present day those who are possessed by demons are sometimes exorcised in the name of the real God, and the deceiving spirits themselves confess that they are the demons who were also at work at that time in the pocts ... (Ad AlltoJ. II, viii) Various antidotes were prescribed for the diseases that afflicted the myth-making psyche. Sensing (correctly, from the viewpoint of our own psychology of the unconscious) that the myths arose from the depths of an "irrational," extra-personal realm, the Apologists recommended heavy doses of "reason," where reason is understood rather as modern psychology understands the empirical field within which ego-conscious- ness normally operates. Rationality, as Athenagoras employs the term, means the recognition of, and adherence to the empirically verified facts of scriptural history. (On the claim that Christian beliefis "reasonable" because it follows from the facts of history, cf. Justin Martyr, I Apol. xiii.) This leads to an amusing paradox: the mantic intelligence of the Prophets, claims Athenagoras, foretold the future "rationally," insofar as it was eventually confirmed by the record of later historical events. This sort of empirically ratified reason, however obvi- ously reductive and inadequate an explanation for the uncon- scious machinery ofprophecy, is recommended by Athenagoras as the only reliable prophylactic against the promptings of the daimonic psyche. Justin Martyr had prescribed another kind of reason as a defense against the demonic authors of pagan mythology. He said that by attaching themselves to the Logos (Reason), Christians had made themselves proofagainst the demons who ensnare the weak by "tricks of magic" and "apparitions in dreams." (1 Apol. xiv) From ancient times, the wicked demons have presented such terril)-ing visions to men that those who were not guided by reason (logos) in judging these acts were panic-stricken. Seized with fear and unaware that these were evil demons, they called them gods and greeted each by the name which each demon had bestowed upon himself. But, when Socrates attempted to make these things known to draw men away from the demons by true reason and judgment, then these very demons brought it about ... that he be put to death as an atheist and impiolls person, because, they claimed, he introduced new divini· 66 Harley Price on </page> <page sequence="23"> ties. And now they endeavor to do the very same thing to us. And not only among the Greeks were these things through Socrates condemned by reason, but among the non-Hellenic peoples by the Logos Himself ... Through our belief in Him we not only deny that they who did these things are good deities, but claim that they are evil and ungodly demons. (I Apol. v) DaimonJ which to the Greeks signified nothing other than a god or an emissary from the gods, had come invariably to mean a fallen spirit in the army of Satan for Justin and the Christian Apologists who followed him. In this regard, Christianity's diabolization of the pagan gods was a renewal of the hostility in the Hebrew Bible to the agricultural deities of the Ancient Ncar East. Thus Justin quotes David, Ps. 95: 5, (Vulgate, Septuagint): "The gods of the Gentiles are idols." (Dialog"e with Trypho lxxix) Like the giants of Genesis 6, the Olympian gods are the offspring, according to Justin, of evil angels and the daughters of men. (II Apol. v) Justin explains all of the moral enormities of the Greek gods (their parricides, infanticides, sodomies, incests, adulteries) in relation to this unfortunate ancestry. (I Apol. xxi) However, in the human "reason" that began to counter and exorcise the evil influence of the demons even before the divine Reason manifested Himself in the flesh to the peoples of the Bible, Socrates and others of the Greek sages enjoyed a pre-vision of the Christian Word. In Justin, this idea is related to a theory of the Logos sper1natikos which the Apologist borrowed and adapted from the Middle Stoa, and to which there are many references throughout his works. According to Justin's Christianized version ofit, the eternal Logos has sown "'seeds" of Himself into the souls of all "rational" men (Socrates was one of the Fathers' favorite hothouses of ger- minal Christian truth), and through them even pre-Christians might intuit the True God, as yet unrevealed. But Justin's importation of the pagan doctrine of the Logos spermatikos carried with it theological irradiations alien to Christian historicism; indeed, it merely put in the place of the old pagan formulation for intrapsychic rel1elatio ("daimonic") a new and nominally more acceptable Christian one ("rational"). The afflatus of the implanted Reason oper- ated exactly as the psychic daimon used to. The man in whom the Logos indwelled received his revelation directly from a Mrthopoeia as Dementia 67 </page> <page sequence="24"> residual particle of the divine Reason, latent ab origine in his own soul, with no need to await the mediation of external historical events (from all eternity, insisted Justin, the immu- table Word has whispered His revelation into the psychic ear of the rational man, whether Hebrew or Gentile). The Logos- inseminated man might encounter within his psychic depths an entclechial divinity, like the later Christian mystics whose souls became the private mangers for the Word's ongoing Birth (cf. Meister Eckhart's celebrated doctrine); like the Gnostic Chris- tians striving to re-deifY their materially fettered spirits by awakening to consciousness the dormant SCi1~til/a dei, the "Self," as they called it; or like the daimon-possessed dreamer ofpagan antiquity. The immanentist premises ofJustin's Logos doctrine, along with its significant relationship to a reactivated Stoic belief in the innateness and universality of religious ideas, represented the early harbingers of biblical Christianity's gradual reassimilation to all the modalities and idioms of the ancient mythic theology from which the earliest Christians had originally distinguished the nascent faith. 4. HISTOllICAL REVELATION AND THE DE-DAIMONIZED SOUL The demonization of the mythogenic imagination is most readily understood in the religious-historical context of the ca1ltra paga1Jos polemic: the simple and practical need for an infant Christianity to discredit and retire the torms of a rival tradition. But it is possible to interpret the early Christian antagonism to the mythogenic psyche in much broader theo- logical and psychological terms. E.R. Dodds has argued that the Christian attitude to dreams and other oracular eruptions of the symbol-forming unconscious was not dissimilar to that of late-antique pagan- ism. He points out that drcams werc the one form ofdivination of which Christians approved. (Paga" and Christia", pp. 38- 39) Indeed, as a vehide of spiritual experience, dreams and visions are well-attested in Christian history, enjoying recom- mendations of Scripture, as in St. Peter's citation from the Prophct Joel: "Your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions." (Joel 2: 28; see Acts 2: 17.) Yet, it is also obvious that dreams and visions can unleash an effusion of revelatory energy often at odds with a static Christian the- ology rooted in biblical historicism, and have rhus aroused, 68 Harley Price: on </page> <page sequence="25"> throughout the Christian centuries, all of the suspicions from the official hierarchy that normally attach to "mysticism." Whether Christian or pagan, the dream has the unavoid- able effect of interiorizing the Divine as a psychic reality ac- cessible to anyone with a soul. (As Synesius argued, dreaming is democratic, and no tyrant can proscribe it without proscrib- ing sleep. [De Insom1Jiis viii; see Dodds, p. 38.]) Chalcidius called the divine or oracular dream a revelatio (Commmtary on the Timae"s 256), and indeed the relationship between the Revelation of God fixed in the external historical events of Scripture and the ongoing inner revelatio of the dream has always been problematic in Christianity. Unlike the historical event, which is final and complete, and so caps the well of revelation, the "evelMio of dream or vision is an open-ended theophany; the dreamer continues to receive his own private canon of doctrine and truth. RevelationJ Dream, and Revelatio Jung's psychology has, in the modern age, taken seriously the implications of the intuitions of Tertullian and Chakidius, as they express the ancient consensus onmium that our knowl- edge of God comes through the revelatio of dream. Long before Jung, of course, scholars in many departments of in- quiry had already noted a remarkable congruency between motives spontaneously engendered in dreams and the images and symbols that recur throughout the mythologies, folklore, and sacred literatures of geographically and chronologically disparate cultures. As early as the eighteenth century, these observations led to the hypothesis of the unconscious origin of religious symbols, and in turn to the inference of their derivation from a universal and aprioristic factor within the psyche of the human species. Thus Jung has contended that all powerful religious symbols arise from a common human source which he called the collective or archetypal uncon- scious, and to which each individual continues to have access in the expression of his or her own spiritual life and energies. Identifying the experience of the archetypal unconscious (the ubiquitous and immemorial substrate of a transient individual consciousness) with the experience of an eternal and powerful God, Jung came to sec in its transpersonal and transcultural symbols a means of expressing the universal and unchanging Mythopoeia as Dementia 69 </page> <page sequence="26"> reality of the Divine, and of recovering a vibrant sense of the permanent and continuous inner life on which all religions are founded. Jung has thus argued that in addition to the official the- ologies serially codified by ethnically and culturally distinct communities, one can observe the manifestations ofa theologia naturalis, consisting in the timeless transcultural symbols and images spontaneously and often anachronistically minted by the individual psyche. Throughout his work, one encounters an implicit distinction between Revelation (consisting in sacred narratives, dogmas, rituals) and revelatio (the archetypal dyna- misms out of which all religious Revelations arise, and which continue to express themselves in the "natural" symbols of the psyche, notwithstanding that the canon of Revelation has been closed). Revelation consists in the specific symbols that an historical culture has selected out of the stream of symbols which the unconscious autonomously reveals to the narrower field of consciousness; official Revelations thus express the specific and transitory ethos of a people and its age, but not necessarily the geographically- and temporally-transcendent totality of the religious function. Though all myth, sacred narrative, dogma, and religious symbolism may be traced to the experience ofintrapsychic archetypes, according to Jung, when a Revelation is officially sanctioned, codified, and thereafter mediated from without, individual psychic experience inevita- bly gives way to collective conscious authority. Once, out of the stream of archetypal energies, the revelatio of dream or vision precipitates into the deposits of Revelation (national gods, historical events, and those other "truths" to which a community of faith attaches itself), an extraverted theology usually conscripts the natural symbolic potential of the psyche, and attracts to itself the highest conscious values of the culture and the age. The Revelation now becomes the archetype (the authentic and original), and revelatio a secondary copy or image: an eidolo" or myth. Finding in biblical history the authentic and perfected form of revelation, orthodox Christian theology has tended to invert the relation between the "natural symbolism" of the psyche, as Jung has understood it, and the iconography that eventually solidifies (after conscious scrutiny and rational re- finement) into an historical religious tradition; thereby, the 70 Harley Price on </page> <page sequence="27"> psychic experiences of Christian dreamers and visionaries have come to be regarded as secondary, rather than primordial. Thus the content of those dreams and visions that have been revered in official Christian memory generally mirrors or recalls to the dreamer the content oforthodox Christian doctrine and canonical sacred narrative. The early Christian dreams of Natalius the Confessor, Gregory of Nyssa, and C~'Prian typi- cally played host to heavenly emissaries all ofwhom descended to reaffirm orthodox doctrinal or moral attitudes in the minds of dreamers teetering on the brink of heresy or sin. (See Dodds, pp. 46ff.) A related function of dreams was to Chris- tianize "foreign" images and symbols, as illustrated perfectly by the author of The Shepherd of Hermas, who receives a corrective "revelation" in sleep according to which the aged woman who had appeared to him in a previous vision on the road to Cumae was not the Sibyl, as he had assumed, but the Church. (The Shepherd of Hermas, vision ii, 4) lung has referred in this regard to St. Ignatius' famous dream of the snake with multiple eyes, interpreted by the Spanish mystic first as a divine epiphany, and then an appa- rition of the devil. The many-eyed snake, of course, has no immediate counterpart in biblical iconography. It has ana- logues in Orphic and Ophitic imagery, and as such seems to have arisen spontaneously out of the fecund archetypal depths of St. Ignatius' soul. But the reflex to domesticate these anomalous spiritual energies in deference to an official, pre- existent Revelation inevitably asserted itself. Such "periphras- tic" interpretations as St. Ignatius', according to lung, often served to replace an original experience of the native dyna- misms of the archetypal unconscious with derivative construc- tions, ... images and words borrowed from a foreign source, and ... views, ideas, and forms that have not grown on our soil and have no ties with our hearts, bur only with our heads. Indeed, not even our thought can dearly grasp them, because it never invented them ... Such substitutes can make men shadowy and unreal; they put empty words in the place of living realities ... ("The Personal and the Collective Unconscious," Two Essa.vs on Anal.vtical PS)'- cl1ology, Collected Works, Vol. 7. Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1953, pp. 78-79) 'When dreams are in this way exegetically poured into the Mythopoeia as Dementia 71 </page> <page sequence="28"> ready-made molds of biblical imagery, they do not either modify the standing theological assumptions of the society or enlarge the native spiritual capacities of the individual. Merely recapitulating the Christian situation as it was already con- sciously known to the dreamer through Scripture and tradition, such dreams are not really "revelations" at all (in the sense that a revelation constitutes an outpouring of new spiritual content or the inauguration of novel religious forms), but are better described as i1zsomnia. Macrobius included the insomnium amongst the "useless" class of dreams, insofar it "merely re- peats working preoccupations." (C.S. Lewis' description, The Discarded Image. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1967, p. 64; for Macrobius' classification of dreams, see his Comme1ltary 011 the Dream of Scipio I, iii.) Lewis gives as examples of insomnia such dreams as are mentioned in Chaucer's Parliammt of F01Pls, 99ff.: The wery hunrere, slepynge in his bed, To wade aycyn his mynde goth anon; The juge dremeth how his plees been sped; The carrere dremeth how his cartes gone; The riche, of gold; the knyght fyght with his fan Since, as Jung has argued, dreams only rarely simply restate the current personal or cultural situation, but rather compensate and enlarge it by integrating into consciousness symbols and values that might otherwise remain unrealized in the unconscious, the "dreams" (or rather, the insomnia) of the Shepherd of Hermas, Gregory of Nyssa, or St. Ignatius would seem to bear little relation to an original and spontaneous psychic event. They are more likely to represent, as much as the official doctrines and canonical narratives they imitate, the culturally elaborated products of the collective consciousness of the age. It is easy to see why such dreams were never condemned by the guardians of the Christian Revelation: there was nothing in them to which biblical-historical orthodoxy might object. In general, however, the logic of revelation through dreams, or through those other psychically engendered sym- bols and images of which religious Revelations arc derivatively comprised, moves in a radically different direction from that of conventional biblical-historical Christianity. Pagan dreams 72 Harlc}' Pricc on </page> <page sequence="29"> from the early Christian period underscore the more obvious differences between historical and mythic theologies, as dra- matically illustrated by the second-century sophist Aristides, who in a dream sees his own effigy change into a statue of Asclepius. (Oration XLVII, 17) "How are we to interpret this curious symbiosis between man and God?" asks Dodds. "For Aristides this dream is a symbol of his unity with his divine patron." (Pagan and Christian, pp. 44-45) As in Aristides' recurrent nocturnal encounters with Asclepius (cf. Or. XLII, 7,12; L, 51-53), in late-antique paganism the dream or vision tended to confirm an already vibrant sense of the innate unity between the human soul and the Divine. In the Vita [sidor; of Damascius, for example, the protagonist dreams that he actually becomes Attis and receives a sheafof instructions from Cybele describing a revised protocol of rituals-anointing him, as it were, prophet, priest, and deity of a new (or at least reformed) liturgy. (Cf. Dodds, p. 45.) In late-antique pagan- ism, the dream might thus directly effect the salvation of the dreamer, by transforming him, as in the ancient mysteries, into the god who had so entered his soul. The sense in such dreams as Damascius' of the god within, who is the immediate source of an ongoing revelation, recalls, not surprisingly, the late-antique understanding of mytho- genesis, in which the mediating daimon, resident in the psyche, is the wellspring of religious imagery and knowledge. In such dreams as Damascius' and Aristides', the "race of daimons" that Synesius acknowledged to dwell in the human imagination makes itself known. (Syllesius' image of an intrapsychic nation ofgods may well suggest, in turn, the telos of the individuation process, as Jung has described it throughout his works. When the ego has regressed beyond a layer of personal memory and encounters the archetypes of the collective unconscious, Jung implies that a mythological universe, theretofore unknown, reveals itself to the individual. The gods of canonical mytholo- gies or historical Revelations must originally emerge out of this psychic underworld because, whether conceived as collective archetypes Dung] or interior daimons [Synesius], they have ever been there.) Locating the genesis of religious experience, the meeting place of man and God, in the symbol-forming energies of the daimonic unconscious in this way entailed a radical conception Mythopoeia as Dementia 73 </page> <page sequence="30"> ofdivine immanence; the immediate accessibility of the psychic daimon in dream or mythic fancy ensured that the Divine was fclt as a presence permanently rooted in the human depths. Individuals could continue to call upon this daimonic sector of the soul insofar as their own interiors continued to produce mythological symbols and images. (Cf. the argument of John P. Dourley, The Illmss that We Are: A Jlmgifl1t c,·itiqtte of Christ;a11 ity. Toronto, Inner City Books, 1984, pp. 8f.; passim.) The ancients' understanding of the daimonic psyche as the origin and medium of divine information went hand in hand with a religious epistemology and soteriology in which the daimonically possessed individual's redemption could be seen to depend upon an in-depth experience of his own inner realities. Conversely, religious symbols could be interpreted as expressions of the deepest movements of psychic and spiritual life. They need not be understood, that is, solely as revealed truths, providentially granted from above, about divine re- doubts far removed from the human, or as referents to discrete historical intrusions of the Divine into human affairs, separated from the individual soul by vast distances of space and time. Needless to say, such a recognition was fundamentally at odds with orthodox biblical Christianity, harnessed as it was to an outward-looking faith, which could scarcely discern in its canonical Revelation a set of unretrieved psychic projections historically and literally understood. The De-daimon;zed So"l Biblical Christian theology identified God as mankind's bestower from without of the unique saving intervention of the historical Incarnation, of an ecclesiastically accredited dogma, and of the sacramental means to render these gifts efficacious to the individual soul. These are the bequests of Grace, superadded from above to an otherwise God-forsaken (or, to put it in terms of the history of thc pagan-Christian conflict, de-daimonizcd) soul, and in their absence salvation was un- thinkable. As Tung has remarked, The Christian West considers man to be wholly dependent upon the grace of God, or at least upon the Church as the exclusively and divinely sanctioned eanhly instrument of man's redemption . . . . . . [For the extraverted West] grace comes from else- 74 Harley Price: on </page> <page sequence="31"> where; at all events from outside. Every other point of view is sheer heresy . . . Anyone who dares to establish a connection between the psyche and the idea of God is immediately accused of "psychologism" or suspected of a morbid "mysticism." (Tung, quoted in Dourley, pp. 25f.) In its religious attitude ... the Christian West is extra- verted . . . Extraversion . . . cannot credit man with a psyche which contains anything not imported into it from outsidc, eithcr by human tcaching or divine grace. From this point of view, it is downright blasphemy to assert that man has it in him to accomplish his own redemption. Nothing in our religion encourages the idea of the self- liberating power of mind. (Ibid., pp. 7f.) As the attitude that has dominated Christian religious con- sciousness from the beginning, "extraversion" has thus re- quired that the native myth-making capacity of the soul be either denied or demonized. By restricting truth and value to those external historical entities and events authenticated by and in the scriptural record, Christianity was bound to discredit the interior world of dreams and other natural effusions of the unconscious. The rigorous examination to which the Church in recent times has subjected the apparitions of the Virgin, as reported, for in- stance, at Lourdes, suggests the suspicion with which biblical religion, invariably measuring itself against the fixed standards of historical truth, must approach any future rel1e/atio from the daimon within. In the late pagan world no one would have thought to ask if it was the "real" Asclepius or Cybele who had appeared to Aristides or Damascius. Already conceding that their representations of the Divine are only approximative symbols or accommodations, the mythic theologians would see no conflict between the ongoing revelations granted by ensouled daimons and the recorded myths of literary tradition (especially since the statements of the mythic poets were understood to have emerged from the same daimon-inhabited kingdom of the psyche as those from which private dreams continued to issue). Apart from its acute conflict with paganism, then, Christianity's demonization of myth and the mythogenic psyche was intended to contain its own revelatory energies. In this regard, the historical content on which Christianity rests (the story ofJesus in the Gospels being a record of complete, Mythopoeia as Dementia 75 </page> <page sequence="32"> specific, and punctiliously truthful fact) is not obviously sus- ceptible to embellishment by poets, or augmentation, beyond strict limits, by way of other forms of imaginative activity. Inevitably (as such Jungian critics of Christianity as Dourley have lamented), the natural symbol-forming function of the religious psyche has thus come to be strangled by the Bible's historical exactitudes. Quite outside the circles of depth psychology, however, a number of modern historians of Christianity (including believers who have warned against a creeping nco-paganism) have acknowledged the negative consequences of the Christian demonization of the pagan gods and the mythopoetic pro- cesses in which they have been engendered: the loss of a so- called "mythic consciousness" through which archaic societies were traditionally able to experience in the psychic energies of the imagination, and express through its symbolic language, a living sense of their relatedness to the sacred and the Divine, both outside and within themselves. As Thomas Molnar has recently written, ... we shall see that as a consequence of its conquest, Christianity has lost imagination and cultural vision that roughly parallels the gains it made in other respects-a loss not only because of the suppression of the sacred symbols with which people had lived, but also because of the form of that suppression: Christian doctrine demy- thologized human imagination and the soul's harmony with nature and the cosmos ... Archaic or ancient people were able to personify the forces around and inside them, and thus to integrate themselves with a vast world . . . Christianity, however, dedaemonized the cosmos: it de- nied the existence of the supernatural daemons between the gods and humans and left a vast rift between the realms of the human and the divine. Humanity thus lost its moorings in a cosmic hierarchy, and the cosmos ceased to be an orderly and compact totality ... Indeed, it did something more radical. By eliminating from the cosmos the elements that once both frightened and reassured people, by laying the foundations for the scientific worldview, Christianity prepared the way for a desacra- lized universe . . . [in which] humans have lost their spiritual home. (Thomas Molnar. V,e Pagan Temptation. Grand Rapids, MI, Wm. B. Eerdmanns, 1987, pp. 8-9) Certainly, in unwinding the tapestry of pagan myth, the Christian Apologists needed only to pull on the daimonic 76 Harley Price on </page> <page sequence="33"> thread. Once removed, all ofthe "superstitions" ofpaganism- the "pantheistic" belief in a natural cosmos ensouled by God; the immanentist belief in the intersection of the Divine Psyche with the intrapsychic daimon; the challenges to a fixed canon of Revelation thrown up by the daimonic imagination-could be simultaneously unravelled. So profoundly was the meaning and reality of the Divine in pagan religion revealed in and articulated with the imaginative processes by which the daimonic psyche continued to cast off its mythic eidola. The imponance of}ustin's originally Stoic doctrine of the Logos spertnatikos was precisely in re-installing the daimon expelled from the Christian soul. With this and other early Christian theories that re-grounded revelation in a universal and transcendent order paradoxically immanent within the human psyche itselt~ more hospitable attitudes to pagan reli- gion and mythology could be entertained. Through analogy, interpolation, and allegorical imposition, the biblical history would indeed be elaborated beyond its strict canonical fron- tiers, and to a great extent, reinvested with traditional mytho- logical themes imported from the Greek and Roman poets. With the Apologists' assimilation of other Stoic and Platonic doctrines of the celestial origins and divine nature of the soul, a completely autonomous and self-initiated method of salva- tion would be evangelized in conjunction with the scriptural salvation story, and a new (though archaic) theological con- sciousness would arise to re-deify the psyche, and thus com- pensate the traditionally extraverted assumptions ofrhe biblical istoria. But these developments in early Christian and medieval theology can only be appreciated against the backdrop of an historical fideism which the Apologists at least consciously accepted and defended, even as they initiated processes by which it would be finally transformed.
