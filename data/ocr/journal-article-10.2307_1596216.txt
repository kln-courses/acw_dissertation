<plain_text><page sequence="1">Studia Islamica, 2002 &lt;&lt; The Subtleties of the Ascension: al-Sulami on the Mi'rij of the Prophet Muhammad &gt; (') Frederick Colby The recent discovery of an early manuscript containing previously unknown treatises by the famous Sufi systematizer Abil 'Abd al-Rahmin al-Sulami (d. 412/1021) has shed new light on our understanding of al-Sulami's oeuvre. One text from this "Sulamiyydt" manuscript has already been published, a work on the lives of early Sufi women that has forced scholars to rethink the role that women played in the nascent Sufi movement (2). Another text in the same manuscript, entitled Latd'uf al-mi'ra-j or The Subtleties of the Ascension, has not previously been studied or published (3). It presents a compilation by al- Sulami of the sayings of early Sufi masters on the Prophet Muhammad's Night Journey and Ascension, offering new insight into formative Sufi attitudes regarding the Prophet's otherworldly journey (4). In what follows I will survey 1. This article is based upon a paper the author delivered at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Religion is Nashville TN, November 2000. 2. I am referring to Rkia E. Cornell's Early Sufi Women (Louisville KY: Fons Vitae, 1999), an edition and translation of al-Sulami's Dhikr al-niswa al-muta'abbiddt as-sifif)yydt, al-Sulami wrote the latter as a sup- plement to his well-known biographical dictionary Tabaqdt al-.sfiyya. Although its title had been known to scholars, the work was thought to be no longer extant before its discovery in Riyad. The manuscript, Muhammad b. Sa'fid Library 2118, dates to 474/1081, i.e. less than a century after al-Sulami's death. 3. I am currently preparing an edition and translation of the treatise, The Subtleties of the Ascension, for- thcoming from Fons Vitae. The saying numbers given in reference to this text refer to the system of enume- ration that I have used in this forthcoming edition. All translations in this article are my own unless other- wise stated. 4.

COLBY the principal outlines of al-Sulami's Ascension work by discussing four major themes that al-Sulami develops through his selection of Sufi sayings. I shall argue that these four Ascension themes reflect al-Sulami's own mystical and theological agenda, the harmonization between Sufi exegesis and official Mus- lim tradition on the Night Journey and Ascension of the Prophet. This approach differs from some previous studies on al-Sulami's work by Paul Nwyia and Gerhard B6wering in that it investigates al-Sulami's own role as a compiler of sayings rather than as a resource for the positions of earlier Sufis and scholars ('). Marilyn Waldman has pointed to problems inherent in treating historical texts as "mines of factual information" rather than as carefully structured and stylized works (6). Waldman praises the example set by Marshall Hodgson in his examination of the method of the famous Muslim historian al-Tabari (d. 310/923) who selects and orders anecdotal evidence to reflect his historical vision ('). The present essay attempts to follow Hodgson's lead by examining al-Sulami's interpretation of the Night Journey and Ascension of the Prophet as illustrated through his selection and organization of Sufi sayings in The Subtlties of the Ascension. The text of The Subtleties of the Ascension The text of The Subtleties consists of fifty-six separate sayings, each intro- duced by a short chain of transmitters or isncad that seeks to authenticate the validity of the saying and its oral transmission. In his introduction to the work, al-Sulami claims that he compiled these Ascension sayings at the request of some unknown person who desired a mystical explanation of the Night Jour- ney and Ascension narrative. The terminology that al-Sulami employs in this introductory paragraph helps to delimit al-Sulami's criteria of inclusion for the work: Messenger (Chapel Hill NC: The University of North Carolina Press, 1985); James Morris, "The Spiritual Ascension: Ibn 'Arabi and the Mi'rij", Journal of the American Oriental Society 107 n. 4 (1987): 629-52 and 108 n. 1 (1988): 63-77: Ibn al-'Arabi, al-Isr Ild'l-maqc-mn al-asrd, ed.

I assembled for you selec- tions on that, to the best of my capacity and ability, after seeking from God goodness in it and blessing on it. It is a good and a blessing to the believers (8)." This introduction explains al-Sulami's didactic purpose in assembling The Subtleties, and prepares the reader for al-Sulami's construction of the work around the sayings of the Sufi sages, the wise ones (hukamd'). Rather than recounting the story of the Night Journey and Ascension in a narrative form, and rather than presenting commentary on all of the Qur'An verses that bear upon that narrative, al-Sulami focuses his attention upon deeper levels of understanding. The phrase "the realities of states" (haqd'iq al-ahwal) is particularly significant in this regard, both in terms of the resonance of the Arabic term "the Real" (al-haqq) as a divine name and the mystery of rea- lity itself, and in terms of the importance that Sufis give to the "states" (0hcl, pl. ahwal) of mystical experience. Al-Sulami's claim to have assembled these sayings of the sages into topics or selections (fusisl) gives the impres- sion that he attempts to arrange the sayings into certain discrete units. Such an organizational principle is not obvious in the text, for it does not contain any explicit section divisions. Though al-Sulami does group similar types of sayings together in the same general section of the text, each of the fifty-six sayings stands as a relatively independent unit. Al-Sulami's approach in The Subtleties of the Ascension closely resembles his approach to oral Sufi tradition in his Qur'an commentary and biographical dic- tionary, a methodology that conceals al-Sulami's own perspective behind the fra- mework of the teachings of past masters. Also similar to his Qur'An commentary, the first half of The Subtleties proceeds in an exegetical fashion, beginning with a discussion of the Night Journey verse or Ayat al-isrd', and proceeding to an exa- mination of the vision described in several verses near the beginning of the fifty- third chapter of the Qur'an, al-Najm or 'The Star." (9) Four of the fifty-six sayings from The Subtleties are nearly or exactly identical to passages in al-Sulami's Qur' in commentary, and another six preserve direct parallels with passages in the latter. (10) Despite these textual similarities, over four-fifths of the sayings in The Subtleties do not appear in al-Sulami's Qur'an commentary. Thus while prin- ciples of Qur' n exegesis serve as one guiding principle for al-Sulami's construc- tion of The Subtleties, they clearly do not tell the whole story. 8. Al-Sulami, The Subtleties, introduction. 9. For instance note that sayings nos. 1, 2 and 4 of The Subtleties are identical to sayings found in al- Sulami's commentary to Qur'an 17 (al-Isra'): 1, Haqd'iq al-tafsir, Ms. London, British Museum Or. 9433 [hereafter simply Or. 9433], ff. 151r-v; Ms. Istanbul, Fatih 261 [hereafter Fatih 261], f. 133v. B6wering alludes to the first saying and translates the second in "From Word of God to the vision of God", 214 and 218. While Bowering's contextualization remains valuable, his translations of these sayings must be used with caution as I will illustrate in The Subtleties of the Ascension, forthcoming. 10.

COLBY Al-Sulami does not offer sayings to explicate every verse in the Qur'anic proof texts, and the commentary he does transmit presumes rather than presents the basic underlying Ascension narrative. The text does not treat a host of issues that other Ascension commentaries discuss, questions such as the date of the journey, where the Prophet was sleeping when Gabriel came to him, what he did and saw during his journey to Jerusalem, etc. Not a single saying dis- cusses the prophets that Muhammad encounters in Jerusalem or the issue of which prophet resides in which heaven. Other types of questions seem to have preoccupied the early Sufis, based upon the types of questions that the sayings in The Subtleties address. For example, the early Sufis whom al-Sulami quotes discuss the following questions: What was the purpose of the Ascension? (") Why was the Prophet first shown paradise and hellfire before approaching the divinity? (12) Why did the Prophet not prostrate at the "lote tree of the boun- dary" (sidrat al-muntaha)? (13) Why was the prophet silent about the things that he experienced at the highest station? (14) These and other similar types of ques- tions, along with the responses of an early Sufi master to each question, make up the majority of the sayings that al-Sulami transmits in The Subtleties. Aside from a single mention of the Prophet's mount Buraq (no. 51) and two brief sayings mentioning Jerusalem (nos. 37-38), the Sufi sayings that al-Sulami transmits in the work focus almost exclusively upon the Prophet's experience at and beyond the lote tree of the boundary in the seventh hea- ven. Given al-Sulami's brief introduction (quoted above), in which he expresses the interest of his petitioner in "the details of meanings" and "the realities of states", one can understand focus upon the vision of the divinity and the Prophet's most sublime encounter. Nevertheless, his virtual exclu- sion of traditions from other stages of the journey requires some explanation. ("5) One possible explanation could be that the experiences of the highest sta- tion most easily lend themselves to the elaboration of mystical states such as passing away (fand') and remaining (baqd'), states that al-Sulami was concerned to discuss. Another possible explanation could be that the base narrative of the Ascension that al-Sulami's sayings presume derives not from the sound hadith reports but rather from more popular narratives which emphasize the highest levels of the journey to a greater degree than official traditions. (16) Whatever al-Sulami's reasons for his upperworldly emphasis, 11. Al-Sulami, The Subtleties, no. 8. 12. Ibid., no. 5. Interestingly, most Ascension narratives that detail the Prophet's visit to paradise and hell place these visits after his encounter with God. The premise of this question, therefore, assumes a popular rather than official version of the Ascension narrative. 13. Ibid., no. 9 and no. 13. 14. Ibid., no. 14 and no. 39. 15. Later Sufis such as Ibn 'Arabi explain the mystical meaning behind each aspect of the Prophet's Night Journey and Ascension, not simply the highest stage. See Wronecka, "Le Kitab al-isrda'"; Morris, "The Spiritual Ascension". 16. I have in mind the pseudo-Ibn 'Abbdis Ascension narrative. See the discussion below, as well as my dissertation "Constructing an Islamic Ascension Narrative: The Interplay of Official and Popular Culture in Pseudo-Ibn 'Abbas" (Ph. D. diss., Duke University, 2002). 170</page><page sequence="5">THE SUBTLETIES OF THE ASCENSION it is clear that in The Subtleties of the Ascension mystical commentary takes precedence over narrative flow or organization. To analyze the work, there- fore, I have identified four major themes of The Subtleties. Four Major Themes of The Subtleties of the Ascension A close examination of The Subtleties of the Ascension shows that four major themes appear throughout the work, and a survey of these themes conveys a sense of the work as a whole. (17) These four themes discuss the fol- lowing topics: (1) the superiority of the Prophet Muhammad to all creatures, (2) the investiture of the Prophet with the light of the divine attributes, (3) the nature and propriety of the Prophet's vision of the divinity, and (4) the reason for the Prophet's silence about his highest experience. In what follows we shall examine each of these four themes in turn, comparing their treatment in The Subtleties to that of other Ascension narratives of the same period. I. The Superiority of the Prophet The first major theme, the superiority of the Prophet Muhammad to all other beings, finds echoes in almost every Ascension work. During the Night Journey the Prophet leads all the rest of the prophets in prayer. After- wards he ascends higher in the heavens than any other prophet, a fact emphasized in some versions of the story in an episode where Moses cries when he sees the Prophet surpass him. (18) In popular versions of the tale Muhammad leaves the angel Gabriel behind, for even Gabriel would burn up if he were to proceed one fingertip toward the divine throne beyond his proper station. (19) This idea of the Prophet's superiority to all creatures, human and angelic, appears to have held considerable interest among the early Sufi sages in their discussions of the mystical meaning of the Ascen- sion. The following saying expresses this theme well: "I heard Abu Bakr al-Rdzi (may God have mercy upon him) say: I heard Abu al-'Abbas Ibn al-'Atd' [say]: 'When the Real desired that his pure one and lover should become the furthest of creatures in mention, the greatest of them in nearness, the loftiest of them in glory, the most noble of them in abi- lity, and the most famour of them in rank, he caused him to ascend to the heavens. He ennobled him above the angelic realm. He beautified him with the necklace of the approach, causing him to approach to the carpet of near- ness which the angels and prophets lacked the strenght [to approach]. [He 17. Each of the four themes can be found in twenty percent of the sayings from The Subtleties of the Ascension. 18.

Gabriel's phrase "were I to have approached a fingertip I would have burned up" is alluded to in The Subtleties, nos. 11, 17, and 19. 171</page><page sequence="6">FREDERICKS. COLBY did all this] in order to extol his mention in his heavens just as he raised his mention on his earth. "(20) This saying argues that the Prophet's exalted station derives from God's desire to raise him up to the status of a friend and lover. (21) It proclaims the Prophet's superiority by way of a commentary on the Qur'anic verse "Did we not raise your mention?" that is part of a short sfira which contains an allusion to the opening of Muhammad's breast. (22) Many Ascension narra- tives, including official hadith reports, incorporate that latter event into their discourses. (23) Some narratives, especially the popular Ascension hadith associated with Ibn 'Abbas, associate the idea of God raising the mention of Muhammad with the intimate colloquy (munaTjatt) section of their discourses. In this section, God tells Muhammad that he has honored him with the rai- sing of his mention, and God recounts other favors that he grants to the Pro- phet as well. The structure of the Ascension narrative itself illustrates Muhammad's exalted rank by the fact that he reaches a station that no other prophet or angel before him had reached. The above sentiment can be found in a number of other sayings in The Subtleties, often with more of a mystical interpertation following the idea of Muhammad's superiority. A saying attributed to an anonymous Syrian tea- chers provides an example: "I heard 'Abd Allah b. Muhammad al-Dimashqi say: I asked one of my teachers from Syria, 'Does any other prophet's rank approach that of Muhammad in terms of favor?' He responded, 'Neither near angel nor sent prophet approaches his rank. How could their rank approach his, wile he was in the presence and witness [of God]? Upon the witnessing, he did not lose his spirit and secret-heart until he was approached, spoken to, and whispered to. Marks and traces were cast down, and he stood with the Real in the closest station in which one is able to stand. The expression for this on the night of the ascension is: He was two bows or closer and The heart did not lie in what it saw." (24) This saying illustrates the exegetical technique found in many of the sayings in The Subtletis. They begin with familiar anecdotes from the Night Journey and Ascension narratives, then move beyond the surface level of such anecdotes to explain mystical ideas. The mystical explanation in the above saying first alludes to the exalted station of the Prophet when he rea- ched the divine presence in which he witnessed a vision of the deity. From 20. Ibid., no. 48. On God's desire to spread Muhammad's honor and/or fame, compare no. 36: "One of them said: God desired to illuminate the heavens with the lights of Muhammad, just as he illuminated the earth with his blessings, so he took him on a journey by night to the ascension-ladder". 21.

The two Qur'an quotes from the end of the saying are from sura 53 (al-Najm): 9 and I . 172</page><page sequence="7">THE SUBTLETIES OF THE ASCENSION this point the mystical exegesis continues with a description of the manner in which the Prophet transcends even that station in the state of passing away (fand'). In this mystical state there arises a confusion of identities between lover and beloved, expressed in a series of passive verbs in the third person mascu- line singular: "He was approached, spoken to and whispered to. Marks and traces were cast down..." Yet the saying is careful to insist that the result of this mystical state was not divine union but rather extreme closeness, Muhammad standing as close to the divinity (the Real, al-haqq) as possible. The Syrian sage offers these mystical observations as commentaries on several key verses from sura 53 that serve as a proof text for over a third of all the sayings in The Subt- leties: "Then he drew close and descended, and was a distance of two bows or closer, and he revealed to his servant what he revealed. The heart did not lie in what it saw. " (25) Muhammad's superiority to the rest of creation, therefore, stems not only from the exalted station to which he was able to ascend, but also from the vision of the divinity that he witnessed at that station, and the extreme closeness that he experienced there. II. Clothing the Prophet in the Lights of the Attributes The second major theme in the text illustrates another way of talking about this same experience of transformation and passing away through reference to the divine attributes which surround the Prophet at the highest station. The sayings in The Subtleties employ two different similes for the divine attributes: the attributes are like clothes that embrace and protect the one who has become empty of humain atributes, (26) and they are like lights that perform a similar function. (27) Sometimes the two similes merge toge- ther, depicting the Prophet as clothed in the divine lights: "Al-Wasiti was asked about the approach of the Prophet on the Night Journey. He said: 'He went from his body-soul. He approached through him, from him, to him, and he descended. (28) The veils continued to descend from Muhammad until he arrived at what [God] pointed out with his saying: He was a distance of two bows or closer. (29) That was through the power of the lights which clothed Muhammad in the state of his Night Journey. Were it not for what adorned him, the alighting of the attribute upon him and the clothing of select lights, he would have been burned by the lights of that sta- tion. Gabriel was not empowered to approach that station when he was strip- ped of what clothed the lover." ("0) 25. Qur'mn, sara 53 (al-Najm): 8-11. 26.

Here the final verb tadalld, conventionally understood as "he descended", is read unconventionally as being grammatically feminine singular.

Ibid., sara 53 (al-Najm): 9. 30. Ibid., no. 17. 173</page><page sequence="8">FREDERICKS. COLBY This saying springs from a question about the concept of how the Prophet "drew close", an action implied through an interpretation of the Qur' an verse "then he drew close and descended" as a reference to the Prophet. The above saying begins its exegesis by asserting that the "drawing close" involves the leaving behind of the physical-self or soul, the nafs. It describes the approach after this separation with a series of short preposition-pronoun phrases that illustrate the "immanence" of the divine in the entire process: with him, from him, to him (bihi minhu 'ilayhi). The veils descend and Muhammad arrives at the station of the "two bows distance". At this point the saying explains that Muhammad would never have reached this station without burning up (an allusion to the Gabriel tradition, mentioned above) had he not been clothed in the lights of the divine attribute that descended upon him. The saying does not specify which divine attribute descends. A related saying that follows shortly after this one is more explicit: "He floo- ded him with his lights, emptied him of all his attributes, and adorned and beautified him with the lights of his [divine] attributes." (31) In both cases, however, it is clear that the divine lights protect Muhammad, allowing him to survive an otherwise unsurvivable experience. The descent of the lights also symbolize a goal of some Sufi aspirants, the emptying of their contin- gent attributes in order to be infused with divine attributes. (32) The idea of the Prophet being clothed in the divine lights of the attributes rarely appears in other early Ascension narratives. It has a gnostic or neopla- tonic undertone to it, and it also resonates with the teachings of some proto- Shi'i extremist (ghulat) groups that depict God as taking the form of a being of light. Certainly the doctrine of the "light of Muhammad", a spark of divine light that was part of his creation, was widely discussed among both Jama'i- Sunni and Shi'i groups in al-Sulami's period. (33) However outside of the pre- sent work, I am unaware of other examples within early Jamd'i-Sunni or Shi'i writings of the divine attributes being compared to lights that clothe and pro- tect the Prophet on his Ascension. Identifying the inspiration behind the sayings of this second theme, therefore, must be deferred to future research. 31. Ibid., no. 19. 32. That such a process is not restricted to the Prophet Muhammad can be seen in saying no. 50: "Abli Sa'id al-Kharriz said: 'Before being caused to journey by night, the Prophet fancied and supposed. But when he was caused to journey by night, he realized [the truth] about what he had fancied, and he witnessed what he had supposed The Real also does this when he overcomes the attributes of the servant" 33. On this concept of the nfr Muhammadi, see Uri Rubin, "Pre-existence and Light : Aspects of the concept of NLir Mulhammad", Israel Oriental Studies 5 (1975): 62-119. On this concept in the Tafsir of Sahl al-Tustari, see Sells, Early Islamic Mysticism, 91-96. On the symbol of light in Imdmi Shi'ism, see Moham- mad Ali Amir-Moezzi, The Divine Guide in Early Shi'ism, 48-49, 53-54, 58-59. 174</page><page sequence="9">THE SUBTLETIES OF THE ASCENSION III. The Vision of God The third major theme in al-Sulami's collection of sayings consists of commentary upon Muhammad's vision of God during the Ascension. (34) The sayings do not describe the actual details of the vision. Rather, the early Sufis whom al-Sulami cites are more concerned with two issues: first, how to understand the exeample that the Prophet sets through the modesty and propriety of his gaze, and second, the reason that the Prophet was able to bear the vision. Regarding the first issue, the early Sufi masters often discuss how in the early stages of the Ascension prior to the divine vision the Prophet resisted becoming distracted by created things. He saw fantastic wonders, towering angels and heavenly rivers, but according to this mystical interpretation, the Prophet paid little attention to these things, maintaining his focus on the true divine goal. The following saying offers an example : "One of them was asked: 'On the night of the Ascension, why was the Prophet shown paradise, hellfire, the prophets and the angels before the approach to the Real?' The response was: 'So that he would learn propriety by [seeing] them in the place of empowerment. He veiled the realm of being with what he used to veil, a throne, a seat and their pillars. Were it not for that, nothing would have been steady for him, and something of fancy would have approached his view. When he alone had a single witnessing apart from [other] witnes- sings, all save him was lessened from every sensation to one sensation. The realms of being were offered to the Prophet so that he could speak to the pro- phets and angels. When he knew that the thing desired of him was not that, he closed his eyes to realms of being and what they contained. He took upon the obligation of the propriety of witnessing until he approached and des- cended and he revealed to his servant what he revealed." (15) This passage is noteworthy for its emphasis on the concept of adab, a rich term whose semantic range encompasses polite manners, refined character, and literature in general. Here the idea as interpreted in a Sufi sense desi- gnates the correct way of behaving, the proper way of witnessing divine rea- lities as illustrated by the Prophet's example. God creates even the highest of things to serve as veils, necessary markers for the Prophet's orientation on his journey. When he recognized his true divine goal, however, the Pro- phet averted his eyes from such veils. 34. On this topic see the informative article by BOwering, "From Word of God to the Vision of God: Muhammad's heavenly journey in classical S0fi Qur'an commnetary". Several of the sayings from al- Sulami's Haqd 'iq al-tafsir that B6wering translates in this article, 214-20, also appear in The Subtleties of the Ascension (nos. 1-3, 18,24). 35. Al-Sulami, The Subtleties, no. 5. The Qur'Sn quotations at the end of the saying are once again from sQra 53 (al-Najm): 8 and 10. I would like especially to thank Laury Silvers for her suggestions in deciphe- ring this difficult saying. 175</page><page sequence="10">FREDERICKS. COLBY As for the vision of the divine, the sayings in al-Sulami more often state the fact that such a vision took place than actually attempt to describe the nature of the vision itself. One saying depicts how God's vision into Muhammad's heart precedes Muhammad's vision of the divinity. God grants the vision to Muhammad because of his superiority to all others (theme one, above) in his longing for God. "Al-Nuri said: 'The Real viewed the hearts [of creatures] and did not see any heart that longed for him more than the heart of Muhammad. So he was bountiful toward him with the Ascension, hastening the vision and the conversation. When he was welcomed to that magnificent place of witness, realms of being were diminished in his eyes to the point that he did not turn towards anything. He neither deemed anything pleasing nor magnified any- thing next to the aim for which he aimed." (36) One gets a sense from this saying and others like it that many early Sufis regarded the believers' vision of the divine as properly taking place on the day of judgment, and God grants Muhammad such a vision earlier out of his special favor and intense desire. Here again we see the idea that Muhammad turned away from created things, which consequently shrink in comparison with his aim (al-maq?sid). Although the idea of Muhammad's vision of God was widely discussed in the early Islamic period, especially in the popular Ascension narratives, only rarely does one find parallels to such ideas in official Ascension narra- tives. Nevertheless one parallel that deserves attention appears in the anec- dotes detailing the otherworldly experiences of the early mystic Abfi Yazid al-Bistdmi. Abfi Nasr al-Sarraj preserves several abbreviated versions of these anecdotes, such as the narrative in which al-Bastami claims that he "became a bird whose body was of unity and whose wings were everlastin- gness", and at the end of the experience Abu Yazid realizes that "it was a cheat." (37) Al-Junayd interprets this latter expression by concluding, "He said, 'I knew that it was a cheat' because among the people of the end, the turning to anything other than God is a cheat." (38) This theme becomes more highly elaborated in the later dream-ascension attributed to al-Bistami, a narrative that repeats a refrain upon every stage of the mystic's journey to the presence of the divinity: "O my dear one, my goal is other than what you are showing me."

(40) Several times during his dream-ascension, al-Bistami's longing allows him to overcome the angels who test him, their impressive appearance beco- ming completely diminished to the size of a gnat beside the intensity of Abu Yazid's aspiration towards the divine. (41) Al-Bistdmi's ascension narratives shows the need to maintain the proper attitude toward the vision of created things as one progresses toward the divine. This idea, which according to al- Sulami's work forms a part of the mystical understanding of Muhammad's Ascension, becomes a theme that Sufis later apply to their own mystical experiences as well. A key concept common to both the sayings in The Subtleties as well as Abi Yazid's visionary ascension is the centrality of the longing (shawq) or desire (irdda) of the ascending figure. The Prophet's desire for God is what initially sets him apart from the rest of creation, (42) just as al-Bistami's desire sets him apart from the angels. The Prophet's desire keeps him focu- sed on his goal, just as al-Bistami's desire helps him to refuse the gifts with which the angels continuously tempt him. In both works, therefore, the vision of God becomes connected with the ascending figure's unswerving desire for the divinity in a manner rarely seen outside of mystical works. Neither work discusses the actual content of the divine vision, rather they both trent the specific details of this vision as a mystery that neither God nor his Prophet ever divulge. IV. The Prophet's Silence about his Highest Experience The fourth theme that al-Sulami develops in The Subtleties of the Ascen- sion explains the reason behind this mystery, behind the Prophet's silence or ambiguity in describing the majority of what he experienced in the divine presence. Sayings in this category present the idea that Muhammad never explains exactly what took place because it forms a secret that ought to remain between him and God. For instance, al-Sulami transmits the follo- wing ideas in a saying attributed to Ja'far al-Sadiq: "... [W]hat was was, what happened happened, the lover said to the lover what a lover says to a lover, he kindly favored him with the kind favor of a lover to a lover, and he divulged to him what a lover divulges to a lover. The two concealed and did not disclose their secret to any but themselves. For 40. AI-Sulami, The Subtleties, no. 55 does cite a saying of AbQ Yazid about the Prophet's illustration of the proper conduct (adab) of gazing during the Ascension. Yet unlike in the kitdb al-mi'rdj by al-Sulami's student al-Qushayri (d. 465/1072), al-Sulami makes no explicit reference to an ascension experience of Abii Yazid. See al-Qushayri, [Kitdcb al-mi'rcj], ms. Bankipore 1891, 37v-38r; idem., Kitdcb al-mi'rdj, ed. 'Ali Husayn 'Abd al-Qddir (Cairo: Dar al-Kutub al-Haditha, 1964), 75-76. The latter printed edition contains numerous mistakes and must be used with caution, preferably in consultation with the manuscript source. 41. See, for example, Sells, Early Islamic Mysticism, 245 and 248. 42. Al-Sulami, The Subtleties, no. 33, above; cf. ibid., nos. 31 and 7. 177</page><page sequence="12">FREDERICKS. COLBY that reason he said, 'He revealed to his servant what he revealed,' and no one knew what he revealed except the one who revealed [it] and the one to whom it was revealed." (43) Here Muhammad and his Lord appear as lovers, and the mystery sur- rounding the encounter therefore becomes subsumed under the familiar theme of the lover's secret. The ambiguity of the Qur'anic verse, according to this interpretation, results directly from this desire of the lovers to keep their secret hidden. Other sayings from The Subtleties of the Ascension suggest that the Pro- phet's silence results not from his desire to hide the secret, but rather from the ineffability of the experience. For example in one saying, Junayd repor- tedly stated the following idea: On the night of the Ascension the Prophet reached a limit for which their is neither expression nor description, because of his union with the One and the Singular in that place of witness, the uncertainty of what happened in it, the silence of the Prophet and the abandoning of reports about it." (") According to this idea, the Prophet either would not or could not attempt to describe what he saw and heard at the highest station for the simple rea- son that the visions and sounds defied description. The experience of union (ittihad) in particular is something that would be difficult if not impossible to express in human language, since all human language is based upon the multiplicity of subject and object. (45) As a number of the sayings in The Subtletis point out, the Qur'anic verses that some interpreters attribute to the Prophet's experience at the culmination of his Ascension are vague and ambiguous: he revealed to his servant what he revealed... the lote tree was covered by what covered. (46) Early narrative reports on the Ascension frequently avoid describing the highest station by employing a passive construction: "fifty prayers were revealed to him." (47) This reluctance to attempt to describe an otherworldly or visionary experience in words is a well known motif in popular and mystical literature, and Islamic 43.

(48) The Sufi sayings in al-Sulami's col- lection interpret the Prophet's ambiguity (and similarly God's ambiguity in the Qur'an) as illustrating both the privacy of the intimate experience and the use- lessness of speech for articulating the ineffable. Although the Sufi sayings that al-Sulami transmits in The Subtleties of the Ascension cover numerous other topics that extend beyond the four major themes outlined above, these four themes convey a general flavor of the text and give one a sense fo al-Sulami's authorial strategy. Almost as interesting as the topics that al-Sulami covers that in the sayings that he transmits are the topics that he omits from his collection. For example, one finds no men- tion of technical issues such as the date of the journey or related issues such as the notion that the Sufis themselves experience heavenly journeys. We can understand most of these omissions, however, when we keep in mind al- Sulami's introductory statement in which he delimits his subject to mystical interpretations (not technical issues) of the Prophet Muhammad's Night Journey and Ascension (not the ascension experiences of mystics such as al- Bistami). Al-Sulami's neglect of aspects of the journey, such as the people and places that the Prophet sees while traveling from Mecca to Jerusalem, can also be traced to this mystical emphasis. It is the Prophet's experience at the highest station that most easily lends itself to association with the mys- tical experiences of passing away, intimate dialogue, and divine vision. Despite the fact that al-Sulami quotes the sayings of famous early Sufis as authority figures for the explication of his mystical themes, through the pro- cess of selection and organization al-Sulami turns these otherwise disjointed anecdotes and teachings into a rich and meaningful composition. The Historical Context for the Composition of the Text Although at present I can only speculate on the environment in which al- Sulami assembled The Subtleties of the Ascension, let me conclude with some remarks on this subject. First there is the question of the period in which the text may have been assembled. (49) B6wering notes that al-Sulami composed the majority of his works in a fifty year period, from circa 360/970 until his death 48. E.g. In al-Bistami's vision the mystic repeatedly turns down offers of dominions "that would wear out the tongue to describe" (Sells, Early Islamic Mysticim, 245f.). In the pseudo-Ibn 'AbbAs Ascension nar- rative, Muhammad repeatedly encounters angels and seas that he was not given permission to describe, but even had he been given permission he "would not be able to describe them to you". See the hadith recorded by Ibn Hibbdn preserved in al-Suyiti, al-La'dlf al-masnf 'a f ahddith al-mawdci'a, ed. Abfi 'Abd al-Rahman Sallh b. Muhammad b. 'Uwayda, v. I (Beirut: Ddr al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyya, 1966), 66. Miguel Asin Palacios compares passages in the latter text to Dante's Divine Comedy: see Asin Palacios, La Escatalogta musulmana en la Divina Comedia, 2nd ed. (Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, 1943), 44. 49. The issue of the authenticity of the treatise is beyond the scope of this essay. I am convinced that its authenticity can be argued, however, through a number of correspondences. The following correspondences are perhaps the most significant: the overlap between the sayings in Latd'if al-mi'rdj and in al-Sulami's Qur'an commentary IHaqd'iq al-tafsir, the even greater overlap between the former and a chapter on the sayings of early Sufis by al-Sulami's student al-Qushayri in the latter's Kitdb al-mi'rdj, and finally the early date of the manuscript stetelf. 179</page><page sequence="14">FREDERICKS. COLBY in 412/1021. (5) According to Shariba and Nwyia, al-Sulami probably compi- led his Qur'an commentary at the beginning of this period. (51) There is also some evidence to suggest that al-Sulami similarly may have been middle aged when he composed The Subtleties. Al-Sulami modestly states that he assem- bled sections "to the best of [his] capacity and ability", without any clear orga- nizing principles like those that he presents in his tafsir (52) and tabaqat works. He cites his spiritual advisor al-Nasrabadhi twice in the text (53) without any eulogizing expressions (such as "God have mercy on him") after his name. This omission could signify that al-Sulami composed The Subtleties of the Ascen- sion before 367/977-8, the year in which al-Nasribadhi died. The text would therefore fall within the very first period of al-Sulami's literary career, between the years 360/970 and 367/978. However the text also contains evidence to suggest otherwise, for al- Sulami does give a certain Abi Bakr Muhammad b. 'Abd Allah Ibn Shidhan al-Razi a eulogizing blessing in the text. (5) This detail would suggest that The Subtleties may have been compiled after 376/987, the date of Ibn Shddhan's death. However the text is not consistent in this regard, the hono- rific only appearing in one out of four instances of Ibn Shidhdn's name. Nei- ther piece of evidence is strong enough to establish a definitive date of com- position at this time. Nevertheless there is little doubt that al-Sulami compiled the text during the second half of the fourth/tenth century, a century in which the first independent Ascension works were being written. For instance a contemporary of al- Sulami, the famous Sufi Mulhammad Ibn Khafif al-Shirazi (d. 371/981), also composed a work on the Ascension of the Prophet Muhammad. ("5) The Imami Shi'I theologian Muhammad b. 'All Ibn Babfiya al-Sadfq al-Qummi (d. 381/991), composed an Ascension work as well, probably basing it upon that 50.

BOwering does not accept these conjectures based upon the nature of the work, and establishes instead a terminus ad quem of 396/1005 based upon more definitive evidence. 52. The fact that The Subtleties contains Ascension sayings not found in Haqd 'iq al-tafsir could suggest that the latter predates the former; the opposite may also be the case, howerver, since Haqd'iq al-tafsir contains other sayings not found in The Subtleties. 53. Al-Sulami, The Subtleties, nos. 4 and 23. 54. The phrase, "God have mercy on him" (rahimahu-'lldh), follows Ibn Shidhin's name in al-Sulami, The Subtleties, saying no. 48. His name is cited in three other sayings, nos. 35, 48 and 52, without this eulo- gizing phrase. Ibn ShAdhin is one of al-Sulami's principle sources in his Tabaqdit al-siiflya (see Nwyia, Trois auvres, 27 n. 8). 55. Hajji Khalifa, Kaslifal-Zunuin, attributes two Ascension works to Ibn Khafif: a Kitdb al-isrd' (v. 4, 267, where he is called al-Iskfi) and a Kitdb al-mi'rdj (v. 4, 333). I have not been able to locate any manus- cripts of these works. On Ibn Khafif's view of the Ascension, see Abu al-Hasan Daylami, Sirat-i Shaykh-i KabirAbu 'AbdAlldh Ibn al-HafifAsh-Shirdzi, ed. Annemarie Schimmel (Ankara: Tiirk Tarih Kurumu Basi- vevi, 1955), 296.

Babaya (d. 329/940-1). (") While the former works are no longer extant apart from references in later works, we do possess multiple copies of a mystical text entitled Asrar al-wa~hy that may well date from this period. The latter text describes of a conversation between Muham- mad and his Lord on the night of the Ascension, a work that some have ascri- bed to al-Sulami's contemporary Aba al-Layth al-Samarquandi (d. 373/983). (57) One can see, therefore, that the fourth/tenth century witnessed a sudden fluorescence in Ascension literature, especially in mystical and Shi'i circles in eastern Islamdom. A popular narrative version of the Prophet's Ascension attributed to Ibn 'Abbas was also in circulation during the same period and probably even earlier. (58) It emerges out of an apocryphal Ascension tradition, which Ibn Hibbdn (d. 354/965) records in a long fragment and remarks that it was fabricated in the second/eighth century by one 'Umar b. Sulaymdn al-Dima- shqi. (59) The pseudo-Ibn 'Abbas Ascension narrative subsequently became the basis for an entire genre of popular Ascension discourses, most of which were transmitted in Ibn 'Abbas' name. Both al-Sulami and the Sufi sages who serve as his sources appeart to be well aware of the existence of the pseudo-Ibn 'Abbas Ascension narrative, to be they borrow and interpret cer- tain elements from the latter. One example must suffice for our purposes here. (6) Al-Tirmidhi preserves three versions of a hadith regarding a dream-vision in which the Prophet sees God in His most beautiful form. (61) God asks Muhammad if he knows the sub- ject that the heavenly host debate, and when he admits that he does not, God places his cold hand upon Muhammad's back. The resulf of the touch is that Muhammad gains vast knowledge, among which is the knowledge of what the heavenly host debate. This hadith, springing from an interpretation of a verse from the Qur'an, becomes a narreme that is interpolated into certain versions 56. See Mohammad Ali Amir-Moezzi, "L'Imdn dans le Ciel", in idem., ed., Le Voyage Initiatique en terre d'lslam (Louvain-Paris : Peeters, 1996), 100. Ibn Babiya's work is mentioned in Hajji Khalifa, Kashf, v. 4, 333. 57. See Brockelmann, Geschichte der Arabischen Literatur, vol. 1 (1943), 211, title number 10 s. v. Abil Layth. The Berlin manuscript that Brockelmann mentions has not been available to me. A number of copies not mentioned by Brockelmann are extant, most of which attribute the text to Ja'far al-S.diq. One copy, Istanbul ms. Baghdatli Vehbi 2023, begins with an isndd that mentions a transmission of the text taking place under a certain Ahmad b. 'Abd All.h al-Wa'iz in the year 443/1052. The latter apparently studied the text with a person who heard it from its source, making a provenance in the fourth/tenth century likely. The ear- liest dated copy of the text I have found is Istanbul ms. Yazma Bagislar 148/3, dated to 806/1403. I hope to edit and publish this text in the near future. 58. See my Ph.

Ibrahim al-Qummi (d. ca. 307/919) already mentions the narreme in terms of the Ascension, and his use of the tradition leads into Muhammad's procla- mation of 'Ali's right to succeed him. (63) The pseudo-Ibn 'Abbas Ascension narrative in Ibn Hibban incorporates the dialogue portion of the narreme directly into the intimate colloquy (muna-jat) between Muhammad and his Lord, purged of Shi'i references. (64) The anthropomorphic detail about God placing his "cold hand" on Muhammad also gets appropriated into the pseudo- Ibn 'Abbas narrative at a slightly earlier point in the narrative, when Muham- mad first arrives at the throne. Here it signifies not only God's granting Muhammad divine knowledge but also God's gift of tranquillity and fortitude to bear what he was experiencing. (65). Thus, already in the fourth/tenth cen- tury there are conflicting discourses surrounding the content of the Heavenly Host Debate narreme as it applies to the highest stage of the Prophet's Ascension. Two separate sayings in The Subtleties of the Ascension make it clear that the early Sufis were aware of the way this narreme had been incorporated into the Ascension narrative. In one saying that al-Sulami quotes, Junayd states: "Do you not see how when Muhammad was asked about the heavenly host debate, when the lights of his attributes alighted upon him and he strip- ped him of his attribute[s], he spoke about all places and reported about them?" (66). This saying alludes to the narreme in passing in order to make a point about the high honor ascribed to the Prophet and his experience of fana'. A second saying in al-Sulami's work, appropriates the cold hand detail, reinterpreting it in a mystical fashion "Muhammad was strengthened by the vision of the heavens and the earths and the placing of the palm. After these, he was capable of [bearing] each thing received by his secret-heart from the command of his Lord." (67) The text never explains that "the palm" here probably refers to the divine palm, as is clear from the context of the cold hand narreme. Al-Sulami probably omits this detail in order to avoid the anthropomorphism it implies. Just as the Sufis of the third/ninth and fourth/tenth centuries appropriate the Shi'i luminary Iman Ja'far al-Sadiq for Sufism, (8) so al-Sulami and the early 62. The verse is Qur'An 38 (Sad): 69. Daniel Gimaret was the first to discuss the process of the hadith's incorporation into Ascension literature, working backwards from the Latin Liber Scale to al-Tirmidhi's hadith.

In the process of this appro- priation, the discourse's new narrators purge the traditions of what they take to be its objectionable elements. (69) This idea of adaptation and harmonization may begin to explain why so many authors, al-Sulami included, composed independent works on the Ascension of the Prophet during the fourth/tenth century. During this period the Islamic Ascension narrative represented a "contested space" that different groups struggled to dominate. (70) Al-Sulami selects those Sufi sayings that both reflect a mystical interpretation of the Pro- phet's Ascension and also bring this interpretation into line with Jami'i-Sunni usCili norms. (71) Frederick S. Colby, Duke University 69. The Sufi purging goes a step further with al-Sulami's disciple Abi al-Qdsim al-Qushayri (d. 465- 1072), who preserves the Heavenly Host Debate motif but excises the anthropomorphic "cold hand" element completely. See al-Qushayri, Kitdb al-mi'rdj, fol. 27v (printed edition: 58-59). 70. Michael Sells points out that the heavenly ascent discourse is "one of the major meeting points - and arenas for interreligious and intrareligious contention - in the late antique and medieval Near East" (Sells, Early Islamic Mysticism, 242). In an unpublished paper, Sells coins the term "language world" to stand for this type of shared symbolic system, and he claims that "language worlds" like the Ascension narratives were more often the site of polemical struggle than of unified ideology; see Michael Sells, "3 Enoch (Sefer Hekha- lot) and the Mi'rij of Abli Yazid al-Bistdmi", a paper read before the American Academy of Religion, 1989. 71. Cornell usefully coins the term "usalization " to describe al-Sulami's project; see Rkia Cornell, Early Sufl Women, 37-40. I extend my sincere gratitude to Vincent Cornell for introducing me to The Subtleties of the Ascension, and for his patient guidance and support. I would also like to thank John Lamoreaux, Scott Kugle and Laury Silvers for their valuable assistance during various stages of this project. 183</page></plain_text>
