In the earliest surviving Persian dictionary, writ ten by Asadl Tusl in the mid 5/1 Ith Century, the "Lexicon of the Ancient Iranians" [.Loghat-e fors], the Word is tersely glossed: الغ جون تدم باقي از سروى كاوكد شراب بدو ضبي Is like a wine beaker made from a bull's horn with which they drink wine4 Asadi Tus! then quotes this distich by cAmare Marvaz! to support the définition (Mozarec metre): بنشاه بلارم اليد،رترك ضش وا با جنك سغد يائه ر بما يا لغ وكدوى Have your Turkish beauty seated in the vaulted mansion A wine cup in hand, with a drinking horn and a gourd5 In the early 8/14th Century, Qavvas GhaznavI, who writes in Hindustan, drawing on a différent lexicographical tradition, retains a similar gloss: بالإيسانهاىكهازهاخكاويا از جوب مازني Bälogh: wine vessel made from a bull's horn or from wood.6 Qavvas supports his gloss with the same distich by cAmare.7 In the "Correct Usage of the Ancient Per sians" [Sehah ol-Fois], Ebn Hendushah, probably writing about the same time or shortly after, has this gloss almost certainly altered by a copyist's mistake (shortening Sflru, "horn," to sai, "head," by dropping one letter, ٧٥٧): بالغ يضم لأم مركاو ياككرد« بود يا كاسدجهمبين كد بدان شراب مرني Bälogh with a short "o" after the "1": a head of a bull that has been cleaned or a wooden bowl [lit: with] out of which they drink wine.8 Ebn Hendushah then quotes this other distich by cAmäre Marvazi [Mozäiec metre): يا حنك سغديا نه ويا الغ وكتاب لك،واأ آمي بمه خان حاكرخول خراجه بما صواب Wine cup in hand, with a wine horn and a book The rightful man of eminence came to his ser vant's house The second distich expresses a paradox. The man of eminence [khwaje, who may be a man in high office or a man of letters] cornes in person to the servant's residence. The first hemistich is noted in garbled form. Ketdb, "book," is meaningless in the context. The same quotation, in other dictionaries, has shaiäb, "wine" which makes better sense but is equally unlikely. One would expect the poet to name yet another object relating to wine, pre sumably a vessel after the first two, which are, respectively, a wine cup of a type that has yet to be precisely determined, the saghdiyane,9 and a bälogh, i.e., a wine horn, as has been Seen. This third item, whose name is variously misspelled as ketab, sharab, and, even in one case, kabab ("roast meat؛") is obviously rekdb, i.e, an eight lobed elongated wine boat, as I established in 1993.10 Graphically, ketab and rekab are close enough (a simple ligature for the ta [T] in ketdb, when removed, leaves -kab and the Id [R] in re kdb could be assumed to be a mistaken répétition of a vdv [V] for "and," which it can resemble) to account for the modification when rekab ceased to be understood. The correct version therefore originally read: يا كاسايليانه ا و يا بالغ و ركاب آمي بمه خان جاكرخول خواجه بما صواب Wine cup in hand, with a wine horn and a lobed wine boat The rightful man of eminence came to his servant's house The association of the wine horn with the rekab in the early 5/1 Ith Century is interesting. It is visually borne out as early as the 6th-7th cen tury by the polylobed wine boat, i.e., a rekdb, in the Cleveland Museum of Art.

Wine horns could be carved out of rhi noceros horns for the short, compact type; bulls' horns for the mediumsized model; and elephant tusks for the longest horns; or from wood: الغ يا لأم مضموم يساند شراب ياهد كدازشاخ كركدن و كاو و دندان نيل ومرب مازني Pdlogh, with a short "o": a wine vessel made from the horn of a rhinocéros, the horn of a bull, the elephant's tusk or from wood.13 Here Inju Shlrazl supports his gloss with a verse from the "Book of Garshasp" [Garshasp Name] by Asadi Tus! [Motaqdieb metre): بد يطيش ما نحا ى بر تخت ضش بخ،بالحوىلهسبمبمش He saw him there seated on his throne A wine horn Ipdlogh] and a wine gourd [kale-ye mgy] in front of him13 Soruri, who composed his "Compendium of the Ancient Persians" [Mö/m،jc ol-Fois١ around the same time, expresses himself with a caution that suggests that he had no firsthand knowl edge of the item. He invokes the authority of earlier lexicographers to justify the gloss he puts forward: نميه ونارشاخكاوخاررد، باص بدان شراب خررند Bdlogh [with a short "o"]: Vafa^ describes it as a bull's horn that has been hollowed out. They drink wine out of [lit. with] it.14 This refers to Hoseyn Vafah, who completed his work, "Vafä^'s Thesaurus" [Farhang-e Vafdاو, in 933/8 October 1526-26 September 1527.15 Sorûrî then cites the dictionary written by Mlrza Ehra him Esfahanl, the prince who was murdered in 929/20 November 1522 9 November 1525 by one of Shah Ismacil's Commanders:16 ءر نسخه ميرذا طيرت كد بالغ ابمتح لامء تام ولابني 1ت سالي و [بكر لأم] ساند بود كد از جوب ا داخ مازني و يدان شراب و غير، خيرني ر در سدالئضلأء أبياي تارصى ر قع لأم]آمل، In Mîrzâ's book, [lit.: "manuscript"] it is said that Balagh [with a short "a"] is a province in the north and that balegh [with a short "e"] is a vessel made of wood or from a horn out of which they drink wine and other beverages. It is entered in the "Support of Men of Distinc tion" [.MoDayyed oLFozala], [with a "p" and short "a" (i.e., palagh)]. The MoDayyed oLFozala referred to here is the earlier work of sheykh Mohammad b. sheykh Lad Dehlavi, who wrote in Hindustan in 925/ 1519.17 Sortir! could not make it clearer that the object he discusses was not much in use in his day, at least not in the circles in which he moved. Borhan Tabrïzl, an elusive character who wrote a remarkable dictionary in 1062/14 December 1651-1 December 1652 in Golconda, where he dedicated it to the sultan of Bijapur, betrays even greater uncertainty about the exact Word and nature of the object it describes. In the "Trenchant Argument" [Boihan-e Qatec], he en ters bcilogh and pdlogh separately, either unaware that these are one and the same Word spelled differently, or eager to leave it to the reader to draw his own conclusions. Under palogh, Borhan virtually repeats Inju Shîrâzî's gloss, except for one inaccuracy. Instead of speaking of an ele phant's tusk \dandân\, he uses the phrase "ele phant's bone."18 In his entry balogh, he also reproduces définitions found in earlier writers but adds an invaluable piece of information, which, as will be seen, echoes the reality of his time, i.e., the common use of drinking horn shaped vessels in Georgia: بالغ بضم ثالث و سكؤن غين نقطه دار، شاخ كاومهان خالي يا جوب سان خالي كرد، كه در آن شراب خيرني ودر كرجنا ن؛عارضت و بكر ثالث لم باين معض آمي، ات، و محيط ته شراب را نهركؤيتد Bdlogh, with a short "o" and a silent "gh": a bull's horn or a piece of wood hollowed out in which they drink wine. In Georgia it is corn monly used. It can be pronounced with a short 88</page><page sequence="5">MELiKiAN-CHiRVANi: The Iranian Wine Horn "e," with the same meaning. It is also Said of a wine vessel.19 The hésitation about spellings and the gloss which rambles on uncharacteristically, particu larly in the redundant Statement to the effect that it is "also Said of a wine vessel/' can leave little doubt that by the time Borhan was writing, the Word was no longer clear in the minds of many Persian-speaking literati, whether in Iran or Hindustan. The evidence of poetry conflrms what lexi cography suggests. Pcllogh, as the proper form clearly was, is found in very few verses, none later than the 5/1 Ith Century. ؛Amare MarvazI, the poet quoted in Asadl Tüsl's "Lexicon of the Ancient Persians," is a writer whose work only survives in dictionary entries and whose biographical data elude US, as is the case with a number of other early poets.20 No other occurrences of the noun pälogh are known to me, nor apparently to the lexicogra phers who entered the noun Over the centuries, forever quoting one or the other of these two lines. The likelihood is that pälogh was a Pahlavi Word carried Over into Persian and soon forgotten. The early désignation gave way to a concrete Word describing the physical reality, a "horn," in Persian shdkh, of which the metal, earthenware, or glass drinking horns reproduce the stylized form. Words used in everyday speech are not usually entered in the earlier Persian dictionaries. It is therefore no matter for surprise if the earliest gloss of shakh found in the dictionaries that have so far been published only occurs in the "Jahangirian Thesaurus": شاخ... حهارمظرقى را خواص ى يدانمحراب بموسي. و از *ردم ممد سادا هاد1 كد ءد ولاين كرحمتان شراب وبين، بمناخ كاد و بز كمحبمى ما ند نهى ميضند ظن غالب آنت كد ءهسن يلاقي غرقى را كد يدان محراب خيرني شاخ كؤبمد Shakh: . . . fourthly, the name of a vessel [zarf] out of which they drink wine. Reliable sources report that in the province of Georgia, they drink wine or beer [ibuze, hence the Anglo-In dian "booze," now used in slang] out of the horn of a cow or a mountain goat\hoz-e kühl = ibex] that has been hollowed out. It is gener ally thought that this is why the vessel out of which they drink wlne is called "a horn" [shäkh]. If relatively little attention is thus given to shäkh in lexicography, the existence of an alter native form of the noun, shogh, as rare as shäkh is common, indicates that the Word must have been used all along, for shogh is indeed duly entered from the very beginning by Persian lexi cographers. Asadi Tusi, with his customary brev ity, merely notes the primary meaning, "a bull's horn," but backs it up with a quotation that would suggest that shogh was, in fact, solely used in its secondary, derived meaning as "drink ing horn": قغمروىكاو باقي. ثردوسكنت ؛ ا زى و خني، كرفت و نشت دغكاوودتجالكري،بدت Shogh : a bull's horn \sarü-yegäv\. Ferdowsi says: He began to play and sat smiling Holding a bull s horn and a wolf's tail22 This distich does not occur in the printed edi tions of Ferdowsl's text, but it is consistent with the style of his time. whether it was dropped from the later manuscripts or belongs to another epic has no bearing on the matter under discus sion, the early use of shogh = shäkh, meaning "drinking horn." The reference to the "wolf's tail" (as an emblem of dignity? a phrase describ ing some implement?) is not clear to me. Another distich which repeats the second he mistich is quoted in the 8/14th Century by Ebn Hendushäh in the "Correct Usage of the An cient Persians." It may well be borrowed from the same romance or epic. It occurs in the entry shogh, which Ebn Hendushäh glosses solely as a "drinking horn": ثغ مروى كاد باقي كه بر شق بمالي برد • مبمرسىممت غكساو [و] ءذال،كرممىدت بمكحيال مرمررورا كره، يت Shogh: a bull's horn used by way of a wine cup [sic: piyäle]. Ferdowsi says: couplet 89</page><page sequence="6">MELiKiAN-CHiRVANi: The Iranian Wine Horn Holding a bull's horn and a wolf's tail Having miserably crushed the heads of both with his mace23 The hemistich is repeated with the omission of "and" in the group of words "With a bull's horn [and] a wolf's tail." It was probably carried Over from Asadl Tusl, possibly through dictio naries compiled in the interval. The text from which it is taken must have long been lost. 2. The Drinking Horn in Persian Poetry Literature proves that shakh is the Word that lasted longest in use. Is this because it described the fundamental type of drinking horn as distinct from the horn with the foreparts of animais? Would the latter perhaps have been referred to with a specialized term, such as paloghl while one feels inclined to consider the idea because both the items, i.e., the drinking horn with an animal protome and the noun palogh, appear to go out of use in early times, direct evidence to that effect has yet to be found. shakh, the more Standard Word, is used from the 5/1 Ith Century on across the Iranian World, from shirvan in the northwest and Tabarestan on the Southern Caspian shore, to Kerman in the southeast and Bokhara and Samarqand in the northeastern ter ritories of Mävarä an-Nahr. In a panegyric on the king of Kerman Qavurd b. Amiranshah written not later than 476/21 May 1083-9 May 1084, Azraqi HeravI refers to a horn made of bamboo (iMozäreD metre): ازآلأبوازنمطرانشكغتست كرمحوثاخ كل بيميثاخ خيزران نردش مزين اذ آنكه يرد نسيما، ومهر بؤيش فزرن از أنكد بود يوى مشى وبان از برى اوفمي بقوايد نشاط ه ل لسىإادزاطساىأاء 'Tis no wonder if as a resuit of sunshine and rainfall The bamboo wine horn exhales its breath like a rose spray Its fragrance is brighter because 'tis the light of the moon and the Sun Its fragrance is Stronger because 'tis the fra grance of musk and benzoin The alacrity of the heart is enhanced by its fragrance And the clarity of the heart is enhanced by its light24 Resorting to a traditional conceit of early Per sian poetry, Azraqi uses the same Word shäkh with two différent meanings, "branch" (in "rose spray/') and "horn" (in "bamboo [wine] horn," shäkh-e kheyzoranر and binds them in a paradox ical comparison: both exhale the same breath, i.e., give the same fragrance, thanks to sunshine and rain, which are equally necessary to the rosebush and to the vine. But, the poet goes on, the light of the wine (on which See pp. 94ff.) is brighter than that of the rose because it is the light of the two planets: of the moon, because the wine is drunk out of a crescent boat, and of the sun, because wine is thought of as liquid sunlight. The image in the second distich thus teils US that the wine horn and the wine boat were used in conjunction in Kerman just as the wine horn \pdlogh] and the lobed wine boat Ire käb\ were used in Khorasan earlier in the 5/1 Ith Century. It invariably appears in panegyrics on rulers, viziers, or high-ranking dignitaries, often com posed for the Nowruz (New Year). A Century later or so, Khaqäni thus writes in a long poem in praise of the Shirvanshah (king of shirvän) Abud-Fath Manuchehr (Rajaz metre): جام شان ددر لمد آرائه را حان در لمد L&gt; ن أقبمرءسات؛ردس ازقاخ برنا ;يختي Ho, hand out the dazzling cup, to the free man hand out the soul of life Hand out the dehqän's Spiritual master [ = wine], having poured it out of the youth's wine horn25 The second hemistich coins a formal paradox, a traditional conceit in early poetry. Khaqäni re fers to the wine by using a rarified metaphor "dehqän's Spiritual master" \plr-e dehqän, in which pir, "spiritual master," literally means "old man"] and thus says that the "dehqän's old man [master]" has been poured out of the "youth's horn." With all its awkwardness, the distich yields an important indication. It implies that the wine was poured out into the "dazzling cup" out of the horn. The horn was therefore of 90</page><page sequence="7">MELiKiAN-CHiRVANi: The Iranian Wine Horn a large format, bent at a wide angle, not of the smaller type held in one hand to allow a jet-like stream to be sent into the drinker's mouth. In the first half of the 7/13th Century, Shams Tabasi composed two distichs which caught the attention of Inju Shïrâzï and are both quoted in his "Jahangirian Thesaurus." The first one is a distich from a panegyric on a Great Chamberlain [ulugh Häjib], i.e., a min ister of court affairs called Naslr od-Dïn Mor teza.26 It was composed in Mävarä an-Nahr, as the title ulugh Häjib indicates at that period اRamai metre): دركش آن شاخ مر از باد، كزآتشكه آن مان حان خواهر تا لبإسلررد Drain this (drinking) horn [shakh] full of wine for its fire altar Is desired by the bird of the soul that it may acquire the nature of the Salamander27 Here, too, the metaphorical images require some footnotes. In the first hemistich, wine is equated with a fire altar because wine signifies liquid sunlight or liquid fire alike. Drinking wine is, therefore, the same as swallowing liquid fire. The second hemistich takes the form of yet an other formal paradox by using the conflicting images of the bird, a Symbol of the soul, and the mythical Salamander which swallows or spits out fire. By desiring wine, liquid fire, the delicate "bird" of the soul, which embodies its faculty of esoteric perception, acquires the characteristics of the rough fire-eating Salamander. The second distich is taken from a panegyric also written in Mâvarâ an-Nahr, as is made clear by the name of cAlä od-Dïn Borhänl, in whose praise it is written. cAlä od-Dïn belonged to the Äl-e Borhän or Banl Mäze, a ßokhärä family who exercised their authority Over the Hanafi sect in Mävarä an-Nahr until 616/19 March 1219-7 March 1220, when the most prominent members were exterminated on the Orders of the Khwärazmshäh's mother Tarkän Khätün.28 cAlä od-Dïn resided in ßokhärä. The mention of the wine horn is once again ensconced in an intricate Word play. In each he mistich, a verb used with its literal meaning is matched by the use of the same verb in a meta phorical phrase. The first verb, zadan, means "to strike" and "to emit" or "cast" quickly. The sec ond verb, khoidan, means "to eat/drink," i.e./'to consume" hence the metaphorical phrase gham khordan, "to consume grief/' i.e./'to grieve Over," "to feel sorrow for" (Monsareh metre): شاخ ك—رأن زن مقت ب—ح—~شهماينج هان خلت تمدح ض مض بمي—ش غم آن سرى chop off a heavy horn, do not chop off the world's tail Drink the blood in the beaker, do not choose to grieve any more Over hidden truth29 In the first hemistich, the drinker is invited to chop off a "heavy horn" (to be used as a drink ing horn) rather than spend his life reforming ("chopping off the tail of "I this World. The sec ond hemistich takes up the same theme con veyed through a différent image. In the first half of the hemistich the drinker is urged to drink wine, referred to as "the blood in the beaker," rather than, the second part of the hemistich advises, be consumed with the griefs of this World. Four distichs above in the same poem, Shams Tabasi makes référencé to the wine horn using the same Word shakh. That line is missing in some manuscripts, which may well explain why Inju shirazi did not choose to quote it: نزت روى تربرد آب سمن برى ٣ شاخ صبوح آر تا بهش ز جهاز بد خيم سس كه كردد روان حشت كهساد جدخ در دل اغد نكن تلح خوش كونيي The delight of your face has taken away the glam our of the morning jasmine petals Bring forth the horn of the morning wine that you may profit from the World Before the fountain of the heavenly crests is set in motion Cast into the wine cup the exquisite bitterness of that Kowsarian drink30 The Word play of the multiple images defies ren dition into English. In the first distich "morn ing jasmine petals" could also be understood as "morning jasmine provisions" and "to profit from" as "to consume," "drink/eat up." In the second couplet the first hemistich recommends, 91</page><page sequence="8">MELiKiAN-CHiRVANi: The Iranian Wine Horn as tradition demands, that the libation take place before the Sun (thought of as "the fountain [of light] of the heavenly crests") rises. The second hemistich describes the wine as the paradisiac drink—the Kowsar is a river in paradise. The verse tells US again that the wine horn could still be used for pouring the wine into small shallow cups as had been done in antiquity. In yet another poem which is not quoted by Inju shîràzî either, Shams Tabasi conjures up the image of the drinking horn while coining a cosmic metaphor by using the names of the Zodiacal signs. This occurs in a panegyric on a Sayyed, Najlb od-Dîn Mohammad b. Moham mad اRamai metre): جدي از شاخ جنابت برى خوري، يرنغص ثور بر هران مميت كار بمري، هر زمان Capricorn consumed the benefits out of the horn at your side Taurus on the tray of your expectations was constantly the wine bull31 The first hemistich plays on double meanings as in the previous poem. shakh means both "branch" and "horn"; janäb "side" and "[Your] Eminence/Excellency"; Barg, "leaves," hence "fodder" and "provisions." Barg khordan, which literally is "to eat the leaves/fodder/' is the phrase conveying the idea of "profiting from." Capricorn, the Zodiac sign, "profited from the resources of the vizier," i.e., drank from his wine horn, the poet says in a paradoxical image: the goat drinks out of a horn. Taurus, resting on the tray of the vizier's hopes, was constantly his wine bull اgäv١. Tabasi's distich deserves atten tion for the symmetry in the évocation of the wine horn and the wine bull. Contemporary with Shams Tabasi, Qomri Âmolî, a poet born around the middle of the 6/12th Century in Ämol, in Tabarestan, or Ma zanderan as it was beginning to be called, spent most of his life in the Caspian city where he died in 625/12 December 1227 29 November 1228.32 He writes in an ode (Mojtass metre): شاخ طرب يخرا، مر|زلأدتدر1ب از بهر رتكا) ضن حد مدى كرته جهمذكلى Request the horn of merriment filled with the anemones of wine For the sake of its colour; why drink blood if it is not red as a rose33 The couplet deals with the fundamental theme of wine as a Substitute for blood.34 The image of "the anemones of wine" [.Mle-ye sharab١ refers, as is made implicit in the second hemistich, to the redness of the wine. Laie, a generic name for wild flowers, is used in poetic literature to refer to the flower known as "the daughter's anemone" \läle-ye dokhtari],35 a name that draws its origins from a metaphor describing wine, the "Vine's Daughter" [dokhtai-e laz, see pp. 105-8].36 One génération or so later, Seyf od-Dîn Es farangi wrote in the same part of the Iranian world as Shams Tabasi. Born in 581/4 April 1185-23 March 1186 at Esfarang, Seyf Esfarangi passed away in Bokhara in 666/22 September 1267-9 September 1268.37 Most of his life was spent in Khwarazm and other parts of Mävarä an-Nahr, where he composed several verses mentioning the wine horn. In one, he points to the restricted character of the wine banquets at which wine horns appeared. They were reserved for the inner circle of the vizier or the sultan in person [Monsaieh metre): يم سر خواني كه سنياض ردح أث مجلس خاص ترا بمك-وندكنمءام نا عه بمرنغل موم نقل خيران را سر، ى يخته جو شاخ باد، برء خام On the tray that offers the hospitality of the spirit [ruh١ How can I make available to the common run the banquet of your inner circle So that on the wax tree, for the nogZ-eaters38 Ail the cooked fruits may become raw like the wine [in the] horn? After stating that the banquet gathering \ma]les\ is that of the inner circle [khass], the poet asks rhetorically how he could open it to the com mon run on a tray \khwän\ that dispenses the spirit [ruZj]. The spirit, here, is a metaphor of the wine which ail writers say is "soulenhancing." The poet expresses the hope that cooked fruits Stuck on a wax tree may become, for the benefit of the noqZ-eaters (noql is a white sweet tradi tionally consumed while drinking wine),39 as raw as the wine horn. By this he means the wine 92</page><page sequence="9">MELiKiAN-CHiRVANi: The Iranian Wine Horn itself. Early writers stress that the initiated must drink wine "raw" [khdm], not heated, literally "cooked." It would appear from this verse that wax palm trees with cooked fruits Stuck on their branches would be displayed on, or together with, the tray on which the wine was served.40 In another panegyric on Sacad od-Dïn ar-Riza, "prince of doctors," a physician from Balkh, Seyf Esfarangi strikes the theme of the wine that has the efficaey of the breath of Jesus, who, accord ing to Islamic tradition, can insufflate life into inanimate clay bodies [Ramal metre): به نمهم لطف جازرا ز هواي مجلس نو كل شاخ ياي، ياي، اثر دم سعا By the breeze of its [spiritual] nourishment, on the soul, from the atmosphère of your banquet The rose [= bouquet] of the wine horn has had the effect of the breath of Jesus41 I.e., the wine has revived the drinker's soul [jän, which is also the principle of life] by vir tue of the breeze of spiritual nourishment \lotf, the word used in Sufi thinking]42 that emanates from the physicians banquet. In the second line, the usual pun on the double meaning of shclkh as "branch/stalk" and "horn" defies translation. Gol, "rose," describes the fragrance of wine, and that fragrance, the poet writes, comes out of the horn [shäkh, also "branch"] out of which the wine is drunk. A third panegyric deserves to be noted be cause it is addressed to a cleric holding the high religious office of sheykh ollsläm, one Borhan od-Dïn Samarqandl. In it, Seyf Esfarangi coins celestial images in anthropomorphic garb (Rajaz metre): افراساب تيغ دار از تمرس جسته تهدوار اقتاد، بيني درخار از شاخ جدى ثائران Afrasiyab, sword in hand, having leapt out of Sag ittarius like an arrow You see fallen into drunkenness, rendered help less by the horn of Capricorn43 "Afrasiyab, sword in hand," is a metaphor desig nating the sun. The blazing planet is the king of the Stars [shäh-e anjom١, just as Afrasiyab is the king of Türän, and its rays are like sword blades in literature, as in Visual art. The sun has come out of the sign of Sagittarius, tradi tionally represented as a centaur with its bow at the ready, which is why the poet says, in an ob lique allusion, that he has "leapt out of " it "like an arrow."44 Afrasiyab—the sun—is steeped in drunkenness, smitten by the horn, i.e., the wine horn \shäkh-e اجي،ةرأ of the sign of Capricorn. The casual way in which Seyf Esfarangi coins images referring to the wine horn is Worth not ing. It implies that the use of the vessel was sufficiently widespread in court circles to evoke instant images. In a panegyric on the vizier cAla ol-Molk Mohammad Jalal od-Dln, the poet says in just one line inserted between two others that spell out unrelated images (Mojtass metre): درخت،رمكهيمرإاد يزم؛ و يمنيني جو ثاخ يماه، ز يا تمرن كسل بمار آيمد The waxen tree that they set up in memory of his feast Bears its fruits, as the wine horn does, from the ruby of its roses45 The waxen tree "bearing fruits" echoes the eus tom described above, of setting up waxen palm trees with fruits stuck on the branches at feasts involving wine drinking. The comparison with the wine horn giving out wine described as "the rubies" (the redness of wine) "of its roses" (that is, its fragrance, as if the red colour of the wine were the produet of its bouquet) carries yet an other pun on the double meaning of shäkh as "horn," hence "wine", shäkh-ß bade ["wine horn"] and "branch." But it might also be a lit eral allusion to the ruby insets of floral gar lands, such as those represented at the top of the Parthian wine horns. In another panegyric on a vizier, Shams od Dln Samarqandl, the poet notes in passing in the same casual fashion (.Hazaj metre): ءر مجلس انس نوز عكس رخ سامي حرن كنبمد كل شاخ سراب ات مورد At the feast of the intimate friends, from the re flection of the cupbearer's face The wine horn is covered in rose petals like the chalice of the rose46 93</page><page sequence="10">MELiKiAN-CHiRVANi: The Iranian Wine Horn Here, too, the poet plays upon the two meanings of shakh[ e bade] "[wine] horn" (called here, shäkh-ß sharab, using the Arabie loanword for wine, ظثستية) and "branch." Seyf Esfarangi says that the horn is adorned with rose petals (i.e., the wine) like the chalice اgonbad١ of the rose [gof] itself. Seyf Esfarangl seems to have found this pun ning image particularly attractive. He resorts to it once more in a panegyric on the same Shams od-Dïn Haddadi Samarqandi, hailed by him as "the seal of poets" lMonsareh metre): سرا ى عمرش ز شاخ وبرك امانى ،تسعون ير شاخ بما د ٠ خا م يبمهد • The fruits of his life thanks to the branches-and leaves [ = benefits] of security Have ripened while remaining raw like wine in the horn47 The poet says that the fruits of Shams od-Dïn Haddâdï's life have become ripe [raside, "ar rived"], i.e., that Shams od-Dïn has "corne to maturity," meaning that he has advanced in years. Yet, the poet goes on in a formal paradox, the fruits are raw, as wine for the initiated should be. Many more mentions of the wine horn (as the "drinking horn" should henceforth be called in the Iranian context) could be cited. Did they become scarcer from the end of the 13th cen tury? A far more thorough search through Per sian literature than I have been able to carry out would be needed before such a question can be answered. References to the wine horn cer tainly continued well into Safavid times. In the ll/17th Century, Mansur shïrâzï, known today as Fekrat shïrâzï, wrote this line, quoted by Sorûrï, Rashld Madanl TattavI, and others (Moj tass metre): ؛تاداور،مش|زباد،سظر زمءبشص،وصبمبرممداخ Drunkenness befell his head from the vesperal wine He laid the horn on his hand, departing for the merriment of libations48 The increasingly stereotyped character of the images relating to the wine horn as well as the banality of its later evocations suggest that the symbolism attached to the object was slowly fading away. The ritualized ceremony was turn ing into a tradition upheld for the sake of its pomp borrowed from olden times, rather than its meaning. Part Two: The Ancient Iranian Wine Horns, Their Function and Symbolism At the same time, the fact that the wine horn survived so long as part of a royal ceremonial, solemnly celebrated until at least the time of Khäqänl and Shams Tabasi, says a great deal about its profound imprint on the collective memory of the Iranian world. Like other implements similarly rooted in the age-old past of Iranian civilization (the wine bull, the wine birds, and the wine boats iden tified by this writer in previous studies and shown to have enjoyed much the same conti nuity) the wine horn was used in the wine ban quet [bazm-e mey, later bazm-e sharäb], which was one of the, if not the, most important cere monies at Iranian courts. Never discussed in Orientalist literature until 1992,49 the ritualized ceremony was rooted in cosmic symbolism. In its standard form down to the age of Jami, the cupbearer would turn among the drinkers seated in a circle signifying the sky and pour out wine thought of as liquid golden sunlight or liquid red sunset light [shafaq]. When poured into the crescent-shaped wine bowls it signified the conjunction of the sun and the moon.50 Drinking out of horns was a variation on that theme. Since time immemorial in Middle East ern cultures, the bull was seen as a lunar ani mal and its horns designed together in the form of a crescent. Each horn stood for one half of the crescent, and drinking together out of horns made as pairs, of which a number have survived, probably had a special symbolical meaning. 1. Wine as Light and Blood Persian poetry alternately celebrates wine as liq uid sunlight (or fire) and blood.51 Countless im ages associate the beverage with the "Magians," i.e., Zoroastrians as we understand this word today. Called "the Magian wine" or, mostly, just "the Magian" [moghäne],52 it is occasionally 94</page><page sequence="11">MELiKiAN-CHiRVANi: The Iranian Wine Horn referred to as the "Qibla of Zoroaster."

References to its sacrificial Symbols abound. Najib lorfädeqani writes in the 7/13th Century (Mo/t،J5§ metre): بغوا٠ اغريا د، به فرحى امرين به حؤن يائه سالا له تميل نسيان دست Request the wine vessel, in glory, today With the blood of wine smear your hand at the Feast of Sacrifice54 The first hemistich echoes the light symbolism of the wine, the second one its role as a sub stitute for blood. The idea that wine should be drunk on the Islamic Feast of Sacrifice rings throughout early poetry, illustrating the Islamic garb given to a Substitution rite instituted long before Islam. Khaqanl, his contemporary, writes in a pane gyric in rondel form [محتممرأ-كأ7ممء] on the king of Shirvan, Jalal od-Dïn Abofi Mozaffar Akhsatän (.Rajaz metre): بستان يزان انكشت مز jj نكشت انى خين ير زاهدان انكثتكز1 يا شاهدان جان تاز، كن مجي ازتكهن يرنعان عجيطرب يهن هرنبمان از كار سمين محرزمان خخمن يبز د ممحيان آا0 كن From the cupbearer's fingers grab the blood of the vine, and from those fingers sip it55 Bite your finger [in surprise] at the ascetics,56 with the beauties make your soul anew57 Make wine your soothing every moment, watch the feast of merry-making every moment Out of the silver bull every moment pour out the blood and make the sacrifice anew58 As is mostly the case concerning explicit sac rificial évocations, this one relates to the king. The next couplet shows that the panegyric was composed for the Nowruz, the Iranian New Year, when special emphasis was laid on the wine banquet: خرش عطسي روز ات مى ثميحان يؤدون ات مى ءرثب انرؤز1ث مى زآن ءرمسنان ناراكن 'Tis the pleasant breath of the day, that wine, 'tis the sweet basil of Nowruz, that wine 'Tis the pearl that illuminâtes darkness, that wine; with that pearl make Our dark retreat anew When the wine, called in the first line "the blood of the vine," is poured out of the silver bull, a sacrifice is symbolically reenacted. That wine or "blood" is the source of illumination in darkness \shab, literally "night"]: wine is drunk after dark.59 When singing royal wine banquets, poets dwell on the ancient Iranian character of the ceremony, associated with the Keyanid dynasty, mostly with Keykhosrow and Fereydun. Eskan dar (Alexander the Great) is thus made to say, in Nezâmï's "Book of Nobility" [Sharaf-Name], completed at the turn of the 7/13th Century [Motaqareb metre]: إثانمتبثفّا سكا، براريمبذسزطضبما، برم نمهدلن و آيبمن كى سانهمداه دلازروء&gt; دمى «—كر ح—ين يراق—روني آتسشزجام ضدىرطسلاثضظم The Orders are that tomorrow at dawn We set up a banquet for the whole world In keeping with the custom of Fereydun and the Keyanid cérémonial Let us lay down the canon of the soul from music and wine 95</page><page sequence="12">MELIKIAN-CHIRVANi: The Iranian Wine Horn Perchance, as the fire kindles out of the wine cup Our endeavour shall reach maturity60 through that raw blood61 Elsewhere Nezaml writes in the same "Book of Nobility": يا ادىآنجامآسنهفام بند،كهبردتبهجاىجام أمذاهبمامسولتجسضم بدانجامروصجهانسأضم Corne, cupbearer, that wine cup that has the colour of a mirror Give it to me for in my hand is the best place for the cup when with that wine cup I observe Keykhosrow's ritual By that luminous wine cup, I shall become him who sees the [whole] World62 "The colour of the mirror" is the colour of pol ished Steel or iron from which early mirrors were made from early times down to the Qäjär period. It was held in Persian literature to be compara ble to that of silver, the recommended material for wine cups. In the fourth line, the wine cup is described as "luminous" [.rowshan١ because the wine in it is liquid light. By drinking it, the participant will acquire the initiatory knowl edge that will enable him to See the universe in its entirety, visible and invisible to the hu man eye, as did Keykhosrow according to the Shäh-Näme with his "wine-cup-that-reveals-the World" [iäm-e jahan nama]. These were no mere literary évocations of olden times, inspired by some kind of revival ism. As they took part in wine libations, Iranian rulers were consciously acting like Fereydun or Keykhosrow quaffing wine in the ancient cere monial, or thus they were perceived by court poets. Mojir ad-Dîn Bilaqani, a shirvan poet contem porary with Khäqän! and Nezami, says in a pan egyric on an unnamed king (Mozürec metre): در ملكت لميدؤذ مى خدا، لهمن آسا كزبهمنوبلأدرسادىرى In Fereydun's kingdom request wine, in the man ner of Bahman For of Bahman and Fereydün, in this realm, you are the mémorial63 In a ghazal, likewise addressed to an unnamed ruler, Khâqânî writes around the same time (Ra jaz metre): شرط صرص يود كادزددخلن ث حين ساوثى بد، &gt; كاو ذر؛-دلث بمار The requirements for wine libations are the gold [wine] bull and the blood of the vine Give us Siyavush's blood and bring us Ferey dan'sbull64 The second hemistich echoes the metaphor of wine as vine blood poured into the gold (or golden?)65 vessel with new metaphors drawn from the Shäh-Näme. The wine is like the "Blood of Siyavush," a phrase which refers to the character unjustly murdered by Garuy at the in stigation of Garsivaz, Afrasiyab's evil officiai.66 Fereydun rides a bull, which is his emblematic animalthe Keyanid emperor also carries a bull headed mace [gorz-e gävsär١. The gold bull out of which the wine is to be poured is identified in the poem with Fereydün's bull, and, indeed, the 6/12th Century wine bulls, like the earlier bulls from Islamic Iran, are ail represented fully har nessed, with the trappings of a steed, visually indicating that they are to be seen as "Fereydun's bull."67 These literary motifs and their Visual rendi tion echo the intense awareness of the past that characterizes Iranian culture. This awareness was echoed in the eulogistic titulature given to rulers, hailed as "the second Fereydun," "the second Jarnshid," etc., and kept ever alive by pil grimages to the most important sites of ancient Iran throughout Islamic times—notably Takht-e Jarnshid (Persepolis)68 and Takht-e Soleyman, on the shores of Lake Chichast [arabized as shiz],69 as I have shown in several monographs. The use of ancient Iranian vessels at court, which I hope to discuss elsewhere, was yet another expression of this intense attachment to the past. In this context, the fact that the symbolism described in Persian literature should be found to be con sistent with the Visual appearance of the pre Islamic wine horns that have corne down to us is not nearly as surprising as it might otherwise 96</page><page sequence="13">MELiKiAN-CHiRVANi: The Iranian Wine Horn Fig. 2.

The Light and Blood Symbolism in Ancient Iranian Wine Horns No explicit attempt has been made so far to ac count for the contrived combination of a vessel bent in the fashion of a horn with the foreparts of an animal. The combination finds its raison d'être in sacrificial symbolism. The short spout that projects from the chest, more or less where a sacrificial victim's artery would be pierced, or the liquid gushing forth out of the mouth, both conjure up the image of a slain victim. All the animais represented at the extremity of Achaemenid wine horns are known to have been the object of actual sacrifices at some point in the past. That is the case with the horse, represented in several wine horns. A remarkable silver horse wine horn came to light in 1968 at Arin-Berd, in Erevan, the capital of eastern Armenia (fig. 2).70 Another is now in the Shumei Culture Foun dation at shigaraki, Japan.71 In both, the ehest is opened up by a small tubulär outlet72, reflect ing the symbolism of the wine, or the blood for which it is a Substitute, as liquid sunlight. Early in the 5th Century Xenophon noted in the Ana basis ("The Return Journey") that horses were sacrificed in Armenia and that they were "sacred to the sun."73 In the Ist Century B.c., a similar Statement was effectively made by Strabo.74 He reported that horses were sacri ficed during the "Mithrakanoi," the festival of Mithra, which continued to he celebrated under the name Mihragan (Tehran pronunciation: Meh regan) as the second great Iranian festival after the Nowruz until at least the 6/12th Century. Gilding on both horses indeed signifies that the wine Coming out of the horn is liquid sun light. Gold in Iranian thinking, be it in science or in poetry, equates with the substance of the sun. cOmar Khayyam, the Iranian polymath best known in the West for his quatrains but more famous in his time for his writings on science, writes in the "Nowruz Book" \Nowrüz-Näme\. زر اكسير آتتابست ر سم اكسير ماه Gold is the essence of the sun, and silver the essence of the moon.75 In poetry, hundreds of verses echo the idea.

A tu bular outlet at the base of the ehest allowed the liquid to flow out. The "blood" of the gryphon is, by définition, a metaphor. The hypothesis of a "literary" reading, as opposed to a religious interprétation, here does not seem far-fetched. That both mythical créatures could be Seen as "sacrificial animais" is established by two low reliefs in the "hundred column" hall at Takht-e Jamshid in which a man in royal attire slays a winged quadruped with the front paws of a lion, the hind legs of some bird, the beak of an eagle, a "mane" of short raised feathers, and the tail of a scorpion.86 Facing these, two other low reliefs respectively show a royal character slaying with an identical dagger a very real lion and a very real bull Standing on their rear legs.87 A similar "literary" reading must surely be required for the glass wine horn excavated by a Tehran Museum team at Takht-e Jamshid (= Per sepolis).88 At the tapering end of the curving vessel, a lion is Seen downing a bull, of which the front part is represented. A variant of the motif, a bull rearing and looking back at the lion that bites its back, is repeated several times on the walls of the palace at Takht-e Jamshid.89 The iconography therefore identifies the glass wine horn as an imperial piece, which is not surprising given that it was found near the im perial palace. The motif of the bull and the lion locked in combat was still associated with royal palaces in the Islamic period. Anvari, praising King Näser od-Dîn, thus alludes to his royal pal ace in the first half of the 6/12th Century اKhaflf metre): سروىودرضذزلحوس مطل، درسكار L»ابدايدمر The lion and the bull without quarrel or anger Forever remain locked in combat90 The fighting animais are "without quarrel or an ger" because they are inanimate images, as are ail figurai Works, a theme which Islamic litera ture emphasizes. Awareness that the motif of the lion Overcoming the bull symbolizes a royal sacrifice persisted in Islamic times. In the 10/ 16th Century, Vahshi Bafql coined this cosmic image depicting the lion and bull as Leo and Taurus [Hazaj metrej: 'نئ،ءجالطلث فاوقافك را اسازباد In search of the emplacement of the [sacrifice] feast of your magnificence May Leo be the guardian of the heavenly bull91 The poet wishes Leo to guard Taurus while the search continues for a sacrificial place worthy of the metaphorical sacrifice feast celebrating the grandeur of the "Prince of Princes" \Mlr-e ml ِ[ت2ةث Ghiyas od Din Mohammad. This is a hy perbolic way of stating that the search is bound to go on forever (no emplacement worthy of the prince's magnificence can be found), since Leo must peacefully watch Taurus in eternity: Zo diac signs do not fight, unlike a real lion and bull. Therefore the sacrifice for which a place is sought can never take place. Interpreted in terms of Persian literary Symbol ism of the Islamic period, the Achaemenid glass wine horn would thus signify that the wine com ing out of the horn Stands for the blood of the bull overcome by the lion, the animal emblem of royalty par excellence. That the onslaught of the lion could indeed be the metaphor of the king's own deed is proven by the ivory scabbard of the Achaemenid period found at Takht-e Sangin in Tajlkestan, on which a huge lion is seen clutching in its claws a tiny stag. The lion represented on the scabbard for a short straight dagger evidently Stands for the warrior using it.92 It is safe to add that this warrior was of royal if not imperial stock. The lion is disproportion ately big just as the king is made to look taller than those surrounding him in Middle Eastern figurai art. No doubt, the wine pouring out of the Takht-e Jamshld glass wine horn was the metaphor of the blood of the bull sacrificed by the lion. Texts of the period are desired before such a "reading" can be accepted as established, but it is likely to be close enough to the mark. Neither the sacrificial symbolism of the wine libation, nor the imperial character of the object seem to be much open to question. The symbolical value of the wine poured out of the horn as sacrificial blood continued un changed after the fall of the Achaemenid Empire,</page><page sequence="16">MELiKiAN-CHiRVANi: The Iranian Wine Horn Fig. 3.

On the silver horn in flg. 11 (below) these seem to consist of two thin rods, possibly wicker. Not much attention has been given so far to this type of ephemeral vegetal headdress which is represented, among other places, in the mural paintings at Panjikand. In one of the scenes, a drinker holding up a wine horn wears this type of wreath.97 It is described in early Persian lexi cography under its name, basäk. In the 5/1 Ith Century, Asadi Tus! briefly notes in "Lexicon of the Ancient Persians": اسرغم بتيني jl يماك ناجى باقي كه Pasak. a crown made from sweet basil [as pargham, which may also refer to any scented plant].98 As late as the ll/17th Century, Inju shirazl defines the pasak as: ناص باقي كه ازكلها ولياحين واسرغمها و بركا عويل مازني I و يائسايا ن و يزركان روزياى مد و جشن و مريم در يلذ دامادى بر سد لهند "a crown made from flowers, from scented flowers, from sweet basil, and from myrtle leaves, that kings and grandees wear during célébrations, and that ordinary people don on their wedding day."99 This identifies the wine horn as one used by a king for a special célébration, very possibly the Nowrriz, when wine banquets took special im portance, echoed in countless verses. The pres ence of the pasak is surely to be connected with Strabo's report in his "Geography" stating that the Persians "present the victim crowned" (it is the Magus, he notes, who directs the sacri fice).100 Here the pasak crowns the victim's horn as it were, and the wine, which symbolizes its blood. In the frieze carved at the top of a wine horn from Nesä ("rhyton 1"), a man holds up such a pasäk.101 The same frieze, which sur vives in nine separate fragments, shows another man leading a goat to the sacrifice, a third man holding up a very large wine horn, musicians, and two satyrs whose presence by definition introduces a metaphorical element—the "sacri fice" may already have been largely symbolical. According to Herodotus, who wrote four centu ries or so earlier, the sacrificer himself wore a crown of myrtle, in other words a pasäk, "over his [domed] cap [Gr. tiara]."102 This does not necessarily contradict Strabo's information but may provide an independent indication. It could explain the mural painting at Panjikand in which a drinker wears a pasäk over his cap while hold ing a wine horn in his hand: the wine drinker wearing the ancient sacrificer's crown symboli cally reenacted the sacrificial rite described more than a thousand years earlier by Herodotus as he allowed the liquid to come out of the wine horn.

They appear over the inside corner of each brow, incised with care, albeit in a slightly hesitant fashion that points to a hand other than the goldsmith's own. Were the whorls in low relief perhaps deemed to be insufficiently legible as sun symbols? No other satisfactory explanation suggests itself. Like the bull, the lion as a royal victim is a theme visually dealt with in pre-Achaemenid antiquity as well as at Takht-e Jamshïd.103 That the lion wine horn was a royal object for a solemn occasion seems clear enough. It is crowned with a pasäk (detail fig. 7), here a sin gle vine branch of which the extremities are tied in a knot in the frontal axis. The same type of vine branch pasäk is worn by the king hold ing up a wine horn terminated with a goat's head represented at the bottom of a silver wine cup from the Panjäb.104 Handled in a thoroughly Indianized style, the figurai scene on the cup must have been executed in the area where it was found. It bears witness to the introduction of the Iranian royal wine ritual, from eastern Iran, perhaps the Nesa area, deep into northern üindüstän. The earliest Persian poems still echo the tra dition of branch wreaths. cAmare says in the 5/ 1 Ith Century اHazaj metre): منراك1زسامحبطنم يا تر أ مروز حنت سره محتم I shall make a pasak from a new willow branch With you today, I shall be the one wedded to greenery105 Was a specific nuance attached to the lynx whose foreparts terminate several wine horns? As far as can be Seen, it came in western Iran with the advent of the Parthian dynasty. A lynx wine horn is preserved in the Arthur M. Sackler Museum (flg. 8).106 A swirling pat tern is discreetly indicated on each Shoulder in the stylization of the fur, as well as Over the tubulär outlet (flg. 9). Gilding which covered the ears, the muzzle, and other parts is still visible here and there. Here, too, the Viewer is twice reminded that wine is liquid sunlight, or, in another metaphorical perception, pure gold. Another lynx wine horn from the same group is now in the Shumei Culture Foundation.107 It offers the crowned version of the type. At the top of the hornlike part of the vessel a pasak with gilt leaves runs under the mouth, worked in low relief. The two extremities of tiny flow ers meet on either side of the frontal axis. Vine branches Coming down Over the ehest of the lynx like a garland are a reminder that this is a wine vessel, and the gilding on the vine leaves conveys the idea that the "vine beverage," in Persian ،ج-ظث raz, is liquid gold, äb-e z،3r. The truncated conical outlet between the legs, cov ered with gilt wine leaf, strikes up the theme yet again. The conceptual continuity with the Achae menid period is underlined by the existence of the remarkable shumei wine horn on which a lynx is Seen devouring a cock.108 The concept is akin to that illustrated by the glass wine horn from Takht-e Jamshid. Just as the lion, an allegorical image for the king in Iranian think ing,109 overcomes the bull, so does the lynx overcome a cock.

These included large wine jars [khom in Persian] of which seven were found in the wine horn room. That, and the re mains of an ivory throne or takht on which the king would be seated, lend greater weight to the second hypothesis. The friezes carved in low relief at the top of the ivory wine horns are important. Some display detailed knowledge of Greek mythological icon ography. The twelve gods of the Olympus are depicted on fifteen wine horns, Apollo and the muses on two horns, Hephaestus and the muses on just one, and Artemis amongst the huntress nymphs on another.113 The Russian writers as sure that "the Greek gods, introduced by the philhellene Parthian kings and adopted by the ruling class, were identified in Parthia with lo cal deities."114 If they are right, this would imply that the Greek deities were thought of as meta phors of the Iranian ones. Going one step further, one may well ask whether the Greek deities, like "Apollo and the Muses," were not altogether pure literary evocations. This would be no more ex traordinary than the purely literary evocation of the "Moon-faced Buddha," its viharas, and other aspects of the Buddhist ritual in the Persian po etry of the Islamic period, as I demonstrated in 1970.115 There is some evidence of the interest taken in Greek literature by Iranians, perhaps in the Parthian period, to which a silver bowl called Bactrian was attributed by Kurt Weitzmann, who thought that it carried scenes drawn from "Peli ades," a lost play by Euripides, and certainly in the Islamic period, when traces of it can still be detected in Persian literary themes, be it in the form of the "Story of Eskandar" in the Shâh Näme or of lost romances such as Vameq and cOzrä by cOnsorï.116 A literary "reading" must likewise have ap plied to the wine horns from Nesä terminated with the foreparts of a mythical creature, the "Iranian gryphon," as the Russians call it, with the head of a lion, the horns of a goat, and the wings of an eagle.117 As has been indicated, the sacrifice of a crea ture that never existed, symbolized by the wine spurting out, is, by definition, a metaphor. If the literary view is correct, this gives some grounds for tentatively putting forward yet an other literary interpretation, this time of the feminine figures holding a wine bottle with which two wine horns from Nesä are terminated (fig. 12).118 To anyone familiar with early Arab poetry dealing with Iranian themes, and with early Persian poetry, the feminine busts irresist ibly call to mind two literary metaphors.

The other is the "Grapes' Daughter/' in Persian Dokhtar-e Angur and in Arabie Bint al-cInab, a phrase also used in Persian at rare intervais as in a famous poem by Hafez.119 I submit as a working hypothesis that this an cient metaphor was visually translated and took the form of feminine busts such as those termi nating the ivory wine horns of Nesa. In Arabie literature, the theme of the "Vine's Daughter" as a metaphor of the wine is Struck as early as the 2/8th Century by Abu Nuwas, who wrote in Baghdad: ذلأثمإطارللبماك بنت الكروم برغم انف الني Let US drink, new and old, The Vine's Daughter, despite the [longl noses of the jealous ones In Persian literature, the metaphor which alter nately refers to the wine or to the grapes from which it is made is frequently associated with the image of a sacrificial victim's blood. In the first half of the 6/12th Century, Anvari says while "Describing the Autumn and Praising Naser od-Dîn Abud Fath Taher" (Ramal metre): لمحتر يزكه نو ير طارم تاكش ليدي مدتي شد كد ير آرنكا سرش در كنبت The Vine's Daughter that you saw on the vine vault Has had for some time its head on a string [stuffed] in the bag121 106</page><page sequence="23">MELIKIAN-CHIRV a N i: The Iranian Wine Horn Fig. 11.

A Century or so later, Kamal od-Dîn Ësfahânï flippantly contrasts the gory image inséparable from wine with the merriment to which it gives rise (quatrain metre): آن مى ف ز خون يختر ر؛و سامي دردايره نشاط مرتمرياشد That wine which is made from the blood of the Vine's Daughter Is at the centre of the circle of merrymaking122 Similar flippancy applied with greater poetic skill still inspired this well-known line by Ha fez in the second half of the 8/14th Century (.Mojtass metre): امسد تعنين يختر رز برخواسد تا مينان هد خهمن از مز، يا يكسايند Read out the condolence letter of the Vine's Daughter That the boon companions may all release tears of blood from their eyelashes123 Mixed with the gory allusions, other images cel ebrate "the beauty of the Vine's Daughter," as this distich again by Hafez in the same metre: حال يحقر لذ سرر حشم مات مكر كد در تشاب نحا ص و يرد، ى ءنست The beauty of the Vine's Daughter is the light of our eyes Though it appears under a mask of glass and a veil of grapes124 In Hafezian fashion, the poem is full of crossed allusions. "The light of our eyes" means some thing precious but the beauty of the "Vine's Daughter" is also light because the "Vine's Daughter" is wine which is, as has been noted repeatedly, liquid light. The beauty appears un der a mask of glass—a typical paradoxical image since glass is transparent—because the wine is held in a beaker, and under "a veil of grapes" be cause the drinker is unaware that the wine is in effect the beauty of a radiant woman. Can such images have any relevance to early times? The question is less preposterous than it Sounds. Metaphors such as the "vine's blood" are age-old. The phrase already occurs in Ugaritic texts of the second millennium B.c., as Rocky Corr of the Freer Gallery of Art, whom I con sulted on the possibility of ancient Hebrew precedents to wine horns and wine bulls, in forms me.125 The "Vine's Daughter" is undoubt edly an ancient image as well.

Illustrations of the "Vine's Daughter," hith erto unrecognized, are later to be found on silver of the Sasanian period, and also on Sogdian sil ver. The Cleveland Museum of Art acquired in 1962 a shallow wine bowl made of silver with the figure of a woman walking in the nude, cast in low relief and applied to the inner surface.127 The woman holds up a scarf over her head, the extremities of which come down on either side over her forearms. The scarf ends then give rise to hanging vine branches. According to the late Dorothy Shepherd, who published the object, the woman in the nude "can only be regarded as a version of the great mother goddess." The "great mother goddess," alas, has no known textual foundation in Sasanian or early Islamic literature. The "Vine's Daughter" does in the poetry of Abu Nuwäs, written within two centu ries of the execution of the Sasanian silver bowl, and of his Persian successors. The naked woman walking between stylized vine trees has every appearance of conveying the literary motif of the "Vine's Daughter." It need not even rule out al together some alternative symbol: double read ings, and an almost incorrigible weakness for puns, were to be the hallmarks of Persian litera ture until at least the 7/13th century. The image of the "Vine's Daughter" might well account for one of the most intriguing groups of wine horns so far recorded, that may for convenience be called "composite wine horns." Structurally, all have a human head in the top part and the head of a horned animal in the lower part, out of which the wine flowed. Otherwise, the composite wine horns are wide apart in terms of the aesthetics, of their regional prove nance, or of the time frame that may be tenta tively assigned to each one of them. One, a glazed vessel of unknown provenance, now in the Brit ish Museum, was published long ago by Kurt Erdmann.128 The head of a woman supports a wine jar which merges into her headdress, while her neck fits into a bull-headed wine horn.129 The division between the latter two elements, moulded separately and adjusted, as are all three, is heavily emphasized by the recessed area at the mouth of the bull wine horn. 108</page><page sequence="25">MELiKiAN-CHiRVANi: The Iranian Wine Horn The most famous piece in the group is struc- commission in a western Iranian center, per turally simpler.

As it passed through the bull head, it would then be thought of as the blood of the bull, that "spittle of the silver wine bull" in Khäqäni's rondels.137 The two Visual metaphors are physically joined, much as literary metaphors, utterly différent in their imagery, will be linked in Persian poetry. The other détails would be consistent with a literary reading. The tubulär outlet Coming out of the mouth conveys the idea of the sacrificial blood. The gilding on the muzzle, the forehead, and the horns of the bull signify that the wine also equates with liquid sunlight. Seen from a literary perspective, the change from a female to a male head in the wine horn from Kohna Masjid raises no problem. Like "the blood of the Vine's Daughter," "the blood of the vine's son (or sons)" is another early metaphor for the wine. cAmare says in a flippant distich quoted by Asadi Tusl to support his gloss of täk as "the vine tree" (.Mojtass metre): بمك لحت خون بعه تاكم لرن از آنك مم برى مثسك داره لو1 يم كونه عتيق Send me a measure of the vine-boy's blood, of that which has the fragrance of musk as well as the hue of cornelian138 In the panegyric on the Great Chamberlain quoted above, Shams Tabasi writes (Ramai metre): ياسختفغه،ازاد،*والفمرا كه ماز ءل اذوليت تكنركبرد لحدن زنكي بمبمكان محي مض بموت كر صى خراهى تا شاخ بشا بركيرد Give the bitter response of wine to the question raised by grief That the mouth of your heart may relish the sweetness of sugar from it Ceaselessly drink the blood of the black boys of the vine If you want it to raise the wine horn of eternity139 The "black boys" are the individual berries of the grapes. Another metaphor might conceiv ably account for the male head. The "blood of Siyavush" also describes wine.140 The image re fers to the execution of Siyavush by Order of Afrasiyab. Told in the Shäh-Näme,141 the Story undoubtedly has pre-Islamic antecedents. It is of interest to note that in Persian litera ture, the image involving a female figure, the "Vine's Daughter" or "the Sun's Daughter," and the image referring to the male warrior Siyavush can succeed each other at short intervais. They clearly had the same evocative value in the poet's mind, as witness these lines by Khäqän! [Hazaj metre): ،سسسننمم و لشنه، آب دره، آن آنس كؤن كلاب يريه هرح،ءالهءامآسانين أدلءمأكاوالر،ا وانرنلجرثسىار ح ررشهد هوا تمطسابهرده أهمدسادشا(نمم إذراسسابلردا I am drunk and thirsty, pour out the liquid Pour out that rose water with the colour of fire Into the bridai recess of the cup that has the colour of the sky Pour out the Sun's Daughter Bring forth the ruby of the crystal jewel bowl Pour out the sun masked by transparency [lit.

This is a quatrain written in the second half of the 6/12th Century by Sharaf Shoforve of Isfahan. In it, the poet, a contemporary of Khaqäni, ad dresses the wine horn as if it were a person and, indeed, in the second distich, says: "You are a Ill</page><page sequence="28">MELIKIAN-CHIRVANi: The Iranian Wine Horn delightful boy." This can only be in reference to a wine horn which was either terminated with the bust of a young boy, more or less on the model of the ivory Parthian wine horns from Nesa, or to a composite wine horn in which the head of a young boy appeared at the top. But whether it was the one or the other makes no différence to the "reading" that it gives US of the human figure in the wine horn. It is a "literary reading," as I called it before. Shoforve's quatrain is of great importance in establishing the fact that wine horns with hu man figures incorporated with their very struc ture, as in Parthian or Sasanian times, were still known and in use in 6/12th Century Iran. Not only that. The wording leaves little doubt that the short poem was specially written to be in scribed on an object. This may either have been a newly made piece in some precious material (silver with a nielloed inscription at the top? or ivory?), or it could have been an early piece pre served in the royal treasury (quatrain metre): اىساخ نثالا^ممىإ.ض بع لينت عوى «ا نظري يا يمشى سيئين يرى و ليك ما را ز ليت بمنتل، ونكته يكرى بمايمض o [wine] horn, alacrity from you should be inno cent "With it you were graced [in Arabie]" is the view that should be taken of US You are a sweet boy but for US from your lips Aside from smiles and anecdotes there should be the sweetness [of wine]143 I.e., the horn is fine and beautiful, but we also want wine from its lip. The third verse indicates in passing that the vessel was a hormshaped beaker, with just one opening. The commissioning of a poem for the wine horn points to its présentation to a figure of considérable importance, perhaps a grand vi zier, if not the ruler himself—Shoforve was the panegyrist attached to the Atabeg lahan Pahla van. The expression used to describe the wine horn, shakh-e neshat, "horn of alacrity," is a mere variation on the phrase found in Khaqäni, shäkh-ß tarab, "horn of merriment." The stan dardized formulation implies that the use of the wine horn was, if not widespread, at least well entrenched in court custom. Further corroborative evidence must be awaited before the suggested "literary" readings of the composite wine horn can be taken beyond the stage of a plausible working assumption. But in the realm of hypothesis, they seem less adven turous than the "Drvaspa," "bull slayer," and other suggested interprétations. The latter are not only inconsistent with one or the other of the Visual characteristics displayed by the com posite wine horns, but they fly in the face of repeated Statements by Herodotus and Strabo to the effect that the Iranians do not represent their divinities.144 If the literary interprétation of the composite wine horn is retained, a broader issue must be addressed. Were not all wine horns already used with literary connotations long before the ad vent of Islam? The universal use by Sasanian times of the wine horn, not just throughout the Iranian World but far beyond its borders, in its broadest sphere of influence, India included, is shown by the silver bowl found in the Panjab. It proves that the ritual of the wine horns was not linked to a specific religious context and there fore is likely to have been a custom echoed in literature. Other motifs involving the use of the wine horn strengthen the assumption that the wine ritual in which it appeared had been reduced to the level of a ceremony with literary overtones towards the end of the Sasanian period. The theme of the "Magian Master," in Persian Pire Moghan, which I have analyzed in a previous monograph,145 spread as far afield as Sogdiana in the northeastern corner of the Iranian World and the Sogdian oases of eastern Turkestan. An "old man," in Persian pir, is represented according to Hellenistic Convention, clad in drapes and with a bald head, on an unglazed wine jar acquired at Kashghar, an area where Buddhism was the prévalent religion at the time the vase was pot ted in the 7th or 8th Century (fig. 14146.ا There he is Seen cross-legged quaffing wine, a wine horn in hand.

Weighing against the eastern Ira nian provenance is the representation of closely resembling wine horns on the eight-lobed silver boat, or rekäb, in the Cleveland Museum of Art (flg. I)152 and on the small wine cup in the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery (below, fig. 21). Both clearly come from western Iran. In addition, the representation on the Sackler bowl would tend to support a date later than the 4th cen tury. Be that as it may, dating and, to a lesser degree, assessing a regional provenance remain too problematic to authorize sweeping state ments regarding the eastern versus the western Iranian world.

Within the framework of Iranian culture, the fact that the man Walking wears the same tunic as the princely character would seem to indicate that both are thought of as equal in status. Could the Walking character be some high-ranking dignitary? In his "Nowrüz Book," cOmar Khayyam tells us: آيين ملوك محجمرازكا« كبمغدو تا بمريذكاد يزدجرد يهمياركهآخرملوك عجم برد حنان يوه، اتكهلوز نورين نغمتكص از مؤلمان يهكانهمؤبد ميدان بمش ملك آمدى با جام نيين ير مى • • • د متا بمش تمردي د نيايشكردى ار را بنيان يائس بميارت ايثان جين مهمبد ميدان از آهمين يرداختى يس بندكان دولت در سدى و خدمتها بمش آوردندى The cérémonial protocol [üTn] of the Iranians from the time of Keykhosrow until the days of King Yazdejerd, who was the last of the kings of the Iranians, was as follows. On New Year [Nowrüz] day, first among the outsiders, the Mobad-e Mobadan stepped forward in front of the kingwith a golden cupfilledwithwine. . . . He recited a panegyric and expressed his praise in the Pahlavi language [zaban-e Päisl] follow ing their usage. When the Mobad-e Mobadän had finished his célébration, the high and mighty came in and paid their respects.156 The man stepping forth alone to carry a jug filled with the wine that has been prepared and a khwanche on which any wine cup would be pre sented in the Iranian World must therefore be some Zoroastrian dignitary, if not the Mobad-e Mobadän (the man on the tahkt is not a king: he is not crowned) if the time of the year can be shown to be the Nowruz. That, indeed, is the case. To the right of the Walking man, the wine is being filtered into a large metallic wine jar with a chevron pattern through a sieve under a fasci cle of three wooden sticks. A ladle is there, its scoop firmly Stuck on top of one of the sticks, its handle turned down after having been used for removing the froth.157 As Rüdaki writes in his famous poem describing the préparation of the wine for the spring [Monsaieh metre): مرد ءمسسهاشمل تا يشوي تجركجش وكردي رخثان The man in charge removes the bubbles That the opacity may go and that it may be corne dazzling158 A wine horn with an animai head (a doe?) lies on the ground, jammed in Visual terms between the fascicle and one of the pillars. The prépara tion of the wine now completed and ready to be drunk by the princely character out of a wine horn intended for his use could hardly be more explicit. This places the scene in the early spring. The préparation of the wine described in gory detail by Rudaki as the ritual sacrifice of the grapes takes seven months from the time the grapes have been picked: دمبمخمأممرسىكالد حرسن نا اررنبمسي نيسمان Inside the wine jar, it thus melts Until the spring and the [first] half of Ney San159 Without transition, Rudaki then sings the royal banquet, conjuring up the image of the prince enthroned: خرو بمر تخت ليسكا، نثسعه ثا، ملوك جهاز &gt; اسرمحرلاه The king seated on his throne in the arched pavilion Shah of the kings of the world, Amlr of Khor äsän160 The headdress worn by the Turkish pages, it may be noted, is the pasak: هر بملل بد م يا ك مورد سهاد، روش مى سرخ و ذلنا د جعدش ييعان Each one of them wearing on their heads a myrtle wreath \pasäk١ With their faces red as wine, their hair and curls like scented flowers161 119</page><page sequence="36">MELiKiAN-CHiRVANi: The Iranian Wine Horn # Fig. 22.

Needless to say, the long poem by Rodaki, which refers to a banquet held in Islamic Khorasan in the early 4/10th Century perhaps two or three centuries after the execution of the Sackler Sil ver wine cup, cannot he looked upon as a precise commentary applicable to the latter. But it gives an important indication, namely a direct link between the préparation of the wine and the Nowruz banquet attended by the king enthroned. The remaining two tableaux fit the idea of Nowruz célébrations. They are scenes of court entertainment. In one (flg. 22), two young men display their prowess at the age-old Iranian-Style wrestling described in the 5/1 Ith Century by Iranshahr b.

The posture was still common in Islamic times. It can be Seen on a fragmentary glazed wine cup, probably of the 7/13th Century, which was found at Sokhlat in the Crimea.163 Two wine beakers are precari ously balanced on the ehest of an acrobat who, with his teeth, grips a third beaker by the rim. The other tableau dealing with entertainment shows two men playing the Persian game of back gammon, nard (flg. 23). One of them has thrown the dice and excitedly raises his hand in a trium phant gesture, as his Opponent Stares gloomily. Like wrestling, backgammon is one of the court entertainments indulged in during the Nowruz célébrations. After saying that "the month of Nowruz arrived," Manuchehri urges in a panegy ric addressed to Sultan Mascud of Ghazni (Mon saieh metre): ازيمرتردباز دادكرازيربمد هوكن،سادكان اتكنى كض بدم From the young backgammon player take a higher stake From his bare hands take the wine bowl and drain it in a flash164 In the Shäh-Näme, the game of naid is de scribed as the invention of Buzorjmehr, the wise councillor of Khosrow Anushirvan, who pur posefully devises it as an Iranian match to the Indian game of chess. Both games are explained as Symbols of war, and both are Seen as a pure création of intelligence.165 Together, the wrestling scene and the game of backgammon symbolize the prowess of the body and of the intellect, the two supreme vir tues about which Khosrow Anushirvan interro gates BOzorjmehr: بملو كنت جائرا نيئين بججت دضهاىسراسردذيبمت He asked him: through what do you polish the soul? For what do you praise bodily prowess?166 The two scenes thus represent more than mere récréations for the king. They are exemplary exercises. The arches under which ail five tableaux of the Nowruz célébrations appear are themselves of some interest. The arcade runs along the walls of an inner courtyard. Ferdowsl notes in the "Book of Kings" that the Nowruz and the Sade festival were celebrated in a special palace at tached to a fire temple, when Bahram Gür re mits their taxes to ail Iranians, they go there, en masse, thanking the Lord [Motaqäreb metre): بمرنمد يكما_ضكد، ءابموانسوذوجشنس They went straight to the fire temple To the Nowruz and Sade festival palace167 Further, Ferdowsl indicates that the Nowruz shrine and palace stands in Äzarbayjan: وشمي انار كار آتثكدء هان جاى jjjjj و جشن د، بامدمىآن;أيخىت خول وتا،&gt;اد1رانوآزايكان When the fire temple préparations were corn pleted In that Nowruz and Sade festival location He [ = Bahram Gür ] made for Äzaräbädegän [= Âzarbayjan] In person with the braves and the free-born men168 121</page><page sequence="38">MELiKiAN-cHiRVANi: The Iranian Wine Horn IOI Fig. 23.

It is also "roses" for its fragrance. In pass ing, the verse shows that in the mid-7th/13th Century the wine horn could still be used in the old way, one hand raising it to allow the liquid to flow into the wine cup. To sum up, every single detail of the icono graphy of the Sackler wine cup is matched by early Persian literary images found in the con text of Nowruz célébrations. Taken separately, none proves by itself that such is indeed the theme dealt with on the cup. Considered to gether, the converging indications are unlikely to be merely a sum total of coincidences. The Suggestion made in the past that the man carrying the tray is a servant was apparently based on the implicit assumption that carrying a tray could only be a menial gesture. But if the man was taking part in the ritualized Nowruz wine libations, carrying the tray [.khwänche١ would have been part of the ritual. In a panegy rie on three Muslim clerics, Khâqânî urges them to "come to the Magians," adding اKhaflf metrej: خوا*جدضسثنصدو Prepare a tray, follow the religious customs of the Magian Into the crystal lobed boat [rekäb] pour the wine173 It was thus left to the participants to carry the tray in the wine ritual. Part Three: The Wine Horn in Islamic Times A vessel so obviously important in the court wine ritual as late as the 7/13th Century in at least some parts of the Iranian World might be expected to be represented by a significant num ber of specimens in the art of the period. It is not. Very few Islamic wine horns sur vive. Like the wine boat, first identified by this writer in 1987 at a London Conference and de scribed at length in 1990,174 it left few physical traces—just enough to establish its existence right through the last Century, but not enough to give any idea of its évolution in time. The earliest piece that probably dates from the Islamic period (if it does not still belong to the Sasanian age) is an unpublished rock crys tal object in a European aristocratie collection (fig. 25). Like all surviving pieces that may be ascribed to or positively belong to the Islamic period, the rock crystal horn reached Europe several centuries ago. In its present condition, it consists of two chamfered curving sections, gradually tapering and mounted in silver gilt in the second half of the 16th Century somewhere in northern Europe, presumably Germany, or the Netherlands.175 The rock crystal piece displays the highest level of craftsmanship. Going by the proportions and the curvature, one gets the impression that not a great deal is missing and that it had no animal head at the tapering end, which would be consistent with all the other wine horns of the Islamic period. Virtually all the rock crystal ves sels of any kind that date from the Islamic period have survived in Europe, mostly in church trea suries, and that may well have been the case with this one, too. Dating it can only be conjectural in the present State of knowledge. The proportion is not far removed from that of the Sackler wine horn, but the curvature is more rigorously geo metrical. The flat surface of the longitudinal facets find very close parallels in a small group of ivory objects considered to be oliphants, all similarly preserved in Europe, and assigned by Ernst Kiihnel to Lower Italy in his monograph on Islamic ivory sculpture.176 The oliphant in the Museum für Deutsche Geschichte (if an oliphant and not a wine horn) in Berlin cornes as close as any,177 particularly if allowance is made for the change in curvature which seems to have been introduced by the European goldsmith to allow greater stability and provide more Space on the underside of the ivory object to fit the spreading foot and the two bird legs in solid silver. Great uncertainty surrounds the provenance of these objects themselves. while noting the close kinship between the remarkably good ani mal sculpture and that of 4/10th Century Egyp tian art, Kühnel thought he detected in the formal Ornament a Byzantine influence, which is not quite as glaring as he States. The patterns look very Eastern, and a Syrian or Egyptian prov enance cannot be altogether ruled out. The date assigned to the oliphant by Kühnel is ca. A.D. 1000.

One of the five characters, all seen standing in a landscape, is a woman in rich court attire who holds up a wine horn beaker in her right hand and a quince in the left hand, thus upholding a tradition already established in the 7th century, as witness the Panjikand mural paintings.182 At her feet lies a gold dish with stone insets, which contains a roast piglet. Such a provocative sight in a large-size picture is hard to imagine in an Islamic house, and it is equally hard to understand how the scholar, who duly noted its presence, could have failed to be struck by its oddity in the presumed Iranian con text.183 On the other hand, positive indications tip the scales beyond reasonable doubt in favor of Georgia. The women wear Georgian costumes (fig. 27). The high-heeled pointed boots made of bright red soft leather, of a kind worn to this day by the Lezghis in neighbouring Daghestan, find parallels in Georgian manuscript painting of the third quarter of the 17th century.184 The gold-thread hair band with its aigrette of a very specific design rising from a trilobate escutch eon pointed downwards again resembles Geor gian court models.185 Some objects lend themselves to similar com parisons. A glass decanter carried by a court woman in another painting in the set of four can, again, be precisely matched from a Geor gian manuscript of the 17th century, this time of "Zilikhaniani."186 The overall handling of the paintings, utterly different from the European-inspired style in Iran as known from Isfahan painting, betrays greater understanding of Western landscape painting in perspective, volume, and toning than Iran ever had. They clearly belong to a Georgian school of painting in the second half of the 17th century that has remained so far unrecognized. In short, the two wine horns illustrated in these paint ings prove that the Kremlin wine horn beaker was a type favored in the aristocratic mansions of Georgia. An import from Iran would be per fectly conceivable. But in view of Injü Shïrâzï's statement that wine horn beakers were made and used in Georgia in his time, later born out by Borhän Tabrîzï, who is aware of the meaning SQJ Fig. 27.

Indeed, wine horn beakers continued to be made in Georgia, as in other Caucasian areas, throughout the 13/19th century and right into this century.

A great deal more material will have to be exam ined before many questions can be answered. One that Springs instantly to mind is whether the wine horn terminated with the foreparts or simply the head of an animal continued to be made in Islamic times. I am not aware of a sin gle object qualifying as one among the "rhyta" published so far. Another is whether wine horns were really as rare in Islamic times as the almost total disap pearance of such pieces might suggest at first. The discrepancy between the continued literary evidence, from poetry and lexicography alike, and the paucity of the items is remarkable. The reason for this is probably that the preferred materials were doomed to destruction. Time has not been kind to rock crystal vessels in Iran, even though these are frequently men tioned in early Persian literature, nor to silver or gold vessels, slmlne and zarilne, which fea ture prominently at court as both historians and poets teil US. Alas, no silver or gold wine bull (Western scholars would refer to this as a "theri omorphic rhyton") of the kind sung in KhäqänI's poems has so far been recorded.192 I have de scribed in two previous monographs how silver plate kept as a currency reserve in the royal trea sure for financial emergencies would be periodi cally melted down.193 Wine horns made from actual horns and even more so, those made from ivory, whether the elephant tusks of the large size model, or the rhinocéros horn of the shorter type, would likewise have easily vanished, bro ken or rotting away. If old Nesa had not been abandoned in antiquity, we would not have any of its ivory wine horns. A similar miracle has yet to repeat itself for the Islamic period. A better understanding of the history of the wine horn should be possible when parallel investigations into Georgian and Armenian lit erary sources on the one hand, and Chinese and Korean literary sources on the other, are carried out. Just as the Persian names for the wine horn have been identified in this essay, it should be possible without doubt to find their equiva lents in these respective languages, particularly in Georgian and Armenian lexicography. Refer ences in literature and other written documen tation will eventually be traced. The likelihood that early Iranian names, probably Parthian, crept into Armenian and Georgian in the West and Prakrit in India, and that semantic calques of the phrase shakh-e جي،ةظ, "wine horn/' were coined, should be borne in mind by researchers investigating these matters. More will no doubt come to light concerning the multiple nuances of symbolism that wine horns had through the centuries. But being able to put some of their early Iranian names on the wine horns, and thereby tracing them to a liter ary context from early Islamic times with very explicit references to the ancient pre-Islamic past of Iran, represents a leap from the unnamed item of uncertain destination to the symbolical instrument of a ritual of which meaningful ech oes are retained. It is also essential for the understanding of literature. Many mentions of the all but forgot ten wine horn are lost on the modern reader of Persian poetry. In a single couplet, unrelated to what cornes before or after, Mascud-e Sacad-e Sal man says in praise of Sultan cAlä od-Dowle Mascud (492/1098-509/1115) (Moz_ metre): شاخ دابمايول كاجانيرآلد بملبمتاه The rose spray, from the alacrity that kindles hearts at your banquet Is bound in duty to come to life in the Garden of Scents194 Hastily read, the line sounds banal. It reveals its subtle word play once the "allusion" \eshäie\, a traditional poetical conceit, based in the present case on the twin meanings of shäkh, "branch" and "wine horn," is perceived. "Rose spray," here, is first to be understood as a metaphor désignât ing the wine horn. It kindles/illuminates hearts because wine is liquid fire/light. It is bound to come to life [lit. "become soulbearing"] because wine gives the soul/life, as countless verses say. And it will do so in the Garden of Scents [Bus tan[ because this is where roses exhale their breath, but also where wine libations must take place: the horn becomes "life-bearing" when it sends its contents into the drinker's mouth. The crossed allusions build up into a formal paradox, 129</page><page sequence="46">M E L I K I A N - c h i r v a n i: The Iranian Wine Horn yet another conceit in early poetry. The wine horn, although an inert object, comes alive, and it does so, the poet assures us, in a flourish of hyperbole, because the alacrity experienced at the royal banquet is so intense. With Azraqi's verse (p. 90), this confirms in passing that shäkh was used to describe the wine horn around a.d. 1100. The likelihood is that this was also the case in Sasanian times. Even if the use of later sources inevitably demands caution from the cultural historian applying them to earlier times, Persian litera ture of the Islamic period represents an invalu able store of potential information on the distant past, untapped for no reason other than the com plete break between archaeological and literary studies, and the equally arbitrary separation be tween studies dealing with the art of ancient Iran and so-called "Islamic art." Objects from pre-Islamic Iran have been dealt with far too long out of their cultural context, as if they were debris from another planet. While the specific solutions submitted in this monograph to the understanding of the structure and the iconogra phy of the wine horn are subject to future cor rection, the relevance of Persian literature to the Iranian past is unlikely to be rejected as a whole. It is a major key in a culture that found its sense of identity at all times by referring to the past, as few others in the world have done. Postscript A new examination of a number of the Nisa ostraca by distinguished linguists and epigra phers such as Livshits is urgently required in the light of the description of the wine ritual and, in particular, the Nowrüz wine ritual given in these pages. Nouns such as shäkh [sah] and pâlogh [pälog], possibly transcribed in the form of their Aramaic semantic equivalent, are likely to be scribbled or incised somewhere. Mentions of the "Magians" involved and of the royal trea sury where the vessels would have been kept may be more numerous than hitherto realized. To mention but these examples, long ago Marie-Louise Chaumont ("Les ostraca de Nisa," JA 256.1 [1968], pp. 11-35; see p. 32) cited three documents that take on a wholly new meaning. In the document Nov. 164, written in 72 b.c., mention is made of "ancient wine jars" [ZNH CTYQ] (mistranslated by Miss Chaumont as "ancient wine"). These were brought to the cel lar in the month of Farvartin (= New Persian Farvardïn), in other words the Nowrüz month. The day was Atrö (= New Persian Äzar), 9th in the month, which may have had an added sym bolical significance, since wine symbolizes liq uid fire, as has been shown here and elsewhere by this writer. The men who brought the wine jars were two scribes (according to Miss Chau mont: perhaps "secretaries," which sounds more likely, something like a dabli in New Persian) and a Magian [MGWSH]. Nov. 100 +91, also written in 72 b.c., records wine brought to "the king's treasure" [GNZC MLK, virtually the wording one would have in New Persian poetry, ganj-e Shâh, rendered in the Aramaic ideograms of Parthian Pahlavi], also in the month of Farvartin. Nov. 240, dated 59 b.c., notes that "in this wine jar [ZNH, not just "vessel" as loosely ren dered by Miss Chaumont, but jar—cf. Arabic dann, semantic equivalent of Persian khom-, ZNH is the word inscribed on jars at Nisa: see p. 130, n. 2] from Appadan wine was brought." Miss Chaumont points out in a footnote the connection with Old Persian Apadana, and leaves it at that. This is an explicit reference to royal vessels designated as such. Whether "Appadan" is any "Apadana" or a specific royal palace may be determined at some later stage after related documents have been reexamined. Mentions re ferring to wine being brought might have seemed trivial. Given the solemnity of the wine ritual established in these pages, the gesture takes a new meaning. One can indeed see wine brought—in big jars, as well as in silver vases with pouring lip—on the walls of the Apadana at Persepolis (together with the rams of the sacrificial ritual) also for the Nowrüz ritual, as I will show elsewhere.

C. Gunter and P. Jett, Ancient Ira nian Metalwork in the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and the Freer Gallery of Art (Washington D.C., 1992), no. 11, pp. 98-100, and on another inscription, like wise unread, on the stag wine horn illustrated in M. Pfrommer, Metalwork from the Hellenized East: Catalogue of the Collections (The J. Paul Getty Mu seum) (Malibu, Calif., 1993), no. 74, pp. 192-93. The catalogue describes it as "an inscription in Aramaic letters (possibly Persian) of the first century a.d. on the belly of the animal." As Persian was not written down for another seven centuries, one assumes that the eminent German scholar, a Hellenist unfamiliar with Iranian culture, refers to Parthian Pahlavi. Few vessel names appear to have been recorded among the documents recovered from Nesä. See I. M. Diakonoff and V. A. Livshits, Parthian Economic Documents from Nisa, ed. D. N. MacKenzie, Cllr, pt. 2 (London, 1976-1979) (3 volumes of plates, one of inscriptions). One that recurs on several ostraca, or pottery sherds, is ZNH, rendered as "jar." I presume Arabic dann to be its direct descendant. Adib Natanzl, to whom is attributed the 6/12th century Arabic/Persian dictio nary Al-Mirqät, ed. Dr. Sayyed Jacafar Sajjâdî (Tehran, 1346/1967), p. 55, glosses it khom. That is indeed the name given to this day to the type of earthenware on which ZNH has been deciphered. 3. The debate about the advent of Zoroastrianism, which has been going on for over a century, remains unresolved. One of the most eminent specialists in the field, Gherardo Gnoli [De Zoroastre à Mani, Travaux de l'Institut d'Études Iraniennes de l'Univer sité de la Sorbonne Nouvelle, vol. 11) opts, as other scholars did in the past, for a period "between the end of the second millennium b.c. around the 10th cen tury, and the early 9th century." 4.

This reinforces the indication that the drinker's mouth would touch the "lip" [lab in Per sianj of the wine horn as it would that of a beaker. The verse thus gives a chronological anchoring point for the use of beakerlike horns, at a time when horns with an inlet and outlet were also used. It also proves that shdkh, "horn," was a generic term covering the two types and that what mattered was the horn shape (for its symbolism), not the structure of the item. 144.
