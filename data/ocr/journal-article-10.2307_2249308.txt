<plain_text><page sequence="1">II.-THE PHILOSOPHY OF JAMES WARD. BY G. DAWES HICKS. I AM responding to the request of the Editor of MIND that I should endeavour to gather together in a concise and con- nected account the distinctive contributions to English Philosophy made by the distinguished thinker, whose death on 4th March last every reader of this Journal will deplore. I am well aware that I am undertaking a task I can only very inadequately fulfil. James Ward was a man of such wide and varied interests, his philosophical results were reached through lines of reflexion which took their rise in so many different spheres of human inquiry, that it is well-nigh impossible for another to do justice to the multitudinous ramifications of his constructive work, or to feel any measure of confidence in being able to fix upon the features that would have seemed to him of primary importance. He brought to bear upon philosophical problems an acquaintance with the facts and principles of natural science such as few philoso- phers have possessed, and one of the charms of his writings consists in the wealth of illustration by which his argument is invariably enriched, drawn from the fields of physics, biology and physiology. Furthermore, I labour under the disadvantage that on certain fundamental issues, such, for example, as on that of the possibility of satisfactorily inter- preting the facts of nature in terms of a monadism, my conclusions, so far as I have succeeded in reaching any, do not coincide with Ward's; and, on that account again, I shall be liable to misjudge certain of his leading conceptions. I do not, however, here propose to play in any way the part of a critic, but simply to try to form as impartial and juldicial an estimate as I can of a philosophy which, whether it be destined to win adherents or not, is certainly one of the fore- most achievements of speculative thought in recent years. Notwithstanding his profound knowledge of German metaphysics, and his genuine admiration of Kant, Herbart, and Lotze, I have always pictured James Ward to myself as a typically English philosopher. He belonged, I think,</page><page sequence="2">G. DAWES HICKS: THE PHILOSOPHY OF JAMES WARD. 281 rightfully to the great traditional school of Locke, Berkeley and Hume, and I do not imagine he would have wished to dissociate himself from that tradition. He had all their regard for empirical fact, and all their distrust of too rapidly obtained general principles. "Philosophers," he said in one of his earliest papers, " may not be poets, and cannot be seers. Ideas are indeed their sole province, but only such ideas as deal straight with facts." There is a vast gulf, he urged, between the knowledge we have so far attained and any absolute idealism that can claim to be more than a hope or a faith. "Many a lofty miountain that appears to have an unbroken contour from base to summit, when. we view it as a whole and from afar, discloses, as soon as the actual ascent begins, minor eminences and intervening valleys innumnerable. Then, for those who can only climb, true progress requires that they lose sight for a time, perhaps for a very long time, of the fital goal; and quite possibly the really highest peak may turn out later to be one not at first descried at all. So the matter stands with philosophy: to-day we are really further on and have no call to hark back; albeit the prospect immediately before us is not the grand panorama seen as in a vision by those who went before." More specifically, how- ever, he approached the discussion of philosophical problems, as the leaders of the English empirical school had always approached them, from the basis of a psychological analysis of the individual mind. Not that he ever committed their mistake of regarding the critical investigation of knowledge as a psychological problem; he had learnt too thoroughly the lesson of Kant for that. But he realised, early, I think, in his career, that the two ways of dealing with the nature of experience, essentially distinct though they are, must neces- sarily throw light on one another, and that for a complete treatment of human knowledge we need to employ both. And, so far as psychology itself is concerned, the standpoint of Locke, Berkeley and Hume seemed to him to be the proper standpoint. Locke, he pointed out, found himself shut in within a circle of 'ideas' and powerless to explain his acquaintance with a world assumed to lie beyond it, but he was able to give a very good account of some of those 'ideas' themselves, and the most important advances in psychology have been made by those who have kept closely to the 'way of ideas'. By abolishing Locke's 'hypothetical outer circle,' Berkeley left the epistemological problem as hopeless as be- fore, but he made the psychological clearer than ever. " Of all the facts with which he deals, the psychologist may truly say that their esse is percipi, in so far as such facts are facts</page><page sequence="3">282 G. DAWES HICKS: of presentation, are ideas in Locke's sense, or objects which imply a subject." This was, as regards psychology, Ward's position from first to last; psychology, he maintained, never transcends the limits of the individual. And I think he was convinced that, while no doubt from the point of view which a completed philosophy would occupy the epistemological inquiry is the prior, yet for us, stationed not at the centre of things but occupying 'a modest position somewhere in the extreme ramifications of reality,' the prior task is to explore what lies within the confines of our individual experience, and to determine, so far as possible, its constitution and niature. In other words, he would, I think, have agreed so far with Locke in holding that " the first step towards satisfying several inquiries the mind of man is very apt to run into is to take a survey of our own understandings, ex- amine our own powers, and see to what things they are adapted ". At all events, such was the course actually followed in his own philosophical development. For some twenty years, after he had been elected 'Fellow of Trinity in 1874, he was occupied mainly with psychological problems, and it was during those years, in 1886 nainely, that his truly epoch- makingi Encyclopjdia article on Psychology was published. When one compares the article with his subsequent work, Psychological Principles, which appeared only seven years ago, it becomnes evident that the philosophical investigations in which he had meanwhile been engaged did not leave his psychological standpoint wholly unaffected. He found reason to modify, for example, in one important respect, the concep- tion of individual experience which he had accepted originally from Locke; he had taken 'ideas,' or ' presentations' to be ' states of consciousness,' modifications of the mnind con- sequent either upon stimulation, or upon its being affected by other presentations; while later, on grounds largely of an epistemological kind, he dismissed this view of the nature of 'presentations' as an unwarranted assumption. But, already in the Encyclopaedia article, Ward's breach with the' associa- tionism' or 'presentationism,' into which the 'new way of ideas' had, in the hands of James Mill and Bain, developed, was complete,-far more complete than, for instance, Bradley's turned out to be in the series of psychological essays, the first of which appeared in the same year as the Encyclopwdia article, that were contributed to the pages of MIND. ForWard was con- fronted at the start with the question whether 'ideas' could be credited with mutual attractionis, repulsions, associations, complications, etc., and thus the postulate of an experiencing</page><page sequence="4">THE PHILOSOPHY OF JAMES WARD. 283 subject be dispensed with-, any subject, that is to say, other than the complex 'idea' which is generated under appro- priate circumstances when 'ideas' are grouped with sufficient distinctness. If a successful account of individual experience could be worked out on those lines, he was ready to concede that the procedure would be scientifically justified. His contention, however, was that every such attempt had broken down utterly, and that, from the nature of the case, no other result could be expected. If a series of 'ideas' is what is known or presented, then what knows, what the series is presented to, cannot itself be a series of ' ideas '; the very phrase 'being aware of' expresses a relation, and like any other relation, it implies more than one term. No one confounds painting with pictures or singing with songs, yet psychologists were constantly confusing the activity implied in consciousness with the objects or products of that activity. Indeed, in a measure the case was even worse. Such phrases, for example, as that 'the mind discriminates this or that ' were of frequent occurrence in their writings, and naturally one would expect to learn that, apart from this activity, the 'ideas' of which it is conscious are not discriminated. In- stead of that, we see the tables turned: the activity is attributed to the 'ideas' and not to that which is conscious of them; the singing arises from the song, and not the song from the singing. Nor could the predicament be avoided by the expedient of making different members of the series subject and object in turn. The series is throughout a series of objects-and to suppose that a later object in the series. can be aware of the earlier one would amount simply to a futile attempt to convert the former into a subject while still protesting that it is an object. W/ard, then, laid it down as axiomatic for psychology that a prinordial duality of object and subject is essentially involved in any item of what is en- titled to the name of 'experience': always the experienced not only implied but stood over against the process of experienc- ing. The psychological concept of a subject is not, however, he maintained, forthwith to be identified with the meta- physical concept of a soul. A psychology with a soul may become as embarrassing as a 'psychology without a soul,' if by 'soul' be imeant an inner zone of being that lives its own life as independently of any objective correlative as Aristotle's deity lived its life independently of the world. What is requisite for psychology is a self for whom there are 'ideas r or ' presentations' plus the series of 'presentations' or 'ideas ' themselves, the two beingr in that unique relation to one another which we call the subject-object relation.</page><page sequence="5">284 G. DAWES HICKS: Ward was well aware of the dangers to which the concep- tion just indicated was exposed. The associationist psych- ology in England had at least given the death-blow to the Scottish school with its interminable faculties, and a like fate had befallen the " alte Vermdgenstheorie " at the hands of the Herbartians in Germany. In further working out the notion of subject, Ward showed very clearly that it in no way com- mitted him to the faculty doctrine. In the first place, he cleared the ground by a preliminary inquiry into the nature of feeling. Understanding by the term 'feeling' suscepti- bility to pleasure or pain, he sought to establish the position that pleasure and pain (the state, namely, of being displeased) are not 'presentations' in the sense in which touches and tastes, colours and sounds, are. They are never, he argued, localised like the former nor projected like the latter; they are not elaborated in conjunction with sense-data and movements into percepts of external things. And if feelings do not fall to the side of the object, they must fall to the side of the subject, be, that is to say, states or conditions of experiencing. Moreover, if a duality of subject and object is essential for all experience, it follows that a succession of 'feelings' cannot, as such, make up an experience. The minimum of psychical life must involve not only a subject feeling but a subject hav- ing qualitatively distinguishable presentations which are the causes of its feeling. In the second place, when we turn to the states of mind indicated by such terms as perceiving, imagining, thinking, desiring, willing, and so forth, it is ob- vious that each of these implies activity and an object. The possibility, therefore, at once becomes apparent of explaining the diversity of the various acts by the diversity of the ob- jects upon which they are directed. That the objects are different is certain; in perception, for example, we are mainly concerned with what Hume called ' impressions,' in inaginat tion and memory with what he called 'ideas'. And the still wider difference between cognition and conation would seem to be explicable along similar lines, when we take note of the fact that, considering for the momnent the simplest cases of each, the objects of the one are sensations and those of the other motor presentations. Ward's contention was, then, that there is an underlying sameness in all the variety of psychical acts, and this common element seemed to him ap- propriately named Attention. Accordingly, psychological facts might be grouped under two entirely distinct categories -one subjective faculty or function of action-under-feeling, or attention, on the one hand, and a field of attention consist- ing of presentationis or objects on the other. Just as in</page><page sequence="6">THE PHILOSOPHY OF JAMES WARD. 285 physics, the legion of 'forces' had been discarded without abandoning the conception of force altogether, so in psy- chology the legion of faculties had gone without abandoning the conception of faculty altogether. In the former case, there had resulted the exacter conception of energy, in the latter the exacter conception of attention. The consequence was that, in proceeding to describe in detail the various modes of the mental life, Ward could avail himself of all that seemed to him sound in the work of the presentationists, while mak- ing use, at the same time, of the notion of an active and feel- ing subject as throughout the essential correlate of all the different kinds of presentations. He insisted, however, that the notion of a subject should not be merely acknowledged, but seriously utilised. It seemed to him absolutely impossible to bring out the characteristics of experience by simply saying: There are such and such pre- sentations or feelings or movements. Psychological state- ments must (and, indeed, always do) take the form: The conscious subject has such and such presentations, feels thus or thus, and acts in this wise or in that. This 'form of con- sciousness' could not be eliminated without mutilating the facts of concrete experience, and ignoring what was essential to each of them. In other words, -the influence of Kant upon Ward's work is here again prominent. That " the 'I think' or 'I am conscious' must be capable of accompanying all my presentations" he would make a cardinal principle of psy- chology no less than of the theory of knowledge. But his extensive knowledge of biology and of the facts of organic evolution enabled him, in the light of this principle, at once to set aside one of the blunders of presentationism which Kant had unfortunately inherited from Hume. Kant, namely, had been the first clearly to see that unity of self is the in.- dispensable condition, without which there could be no ex- perience whatsoever. He had thrown, however, the whole burden of providing this unity upon the subjective side of experience. He had pictured experience as beginning with a mere manifold of disconnected sensations, which require to be synthesised into a temporo-spatial continuity in order to be known. This, Ward contended, was an unworkable thought. Whatsoever development an individual experience may undergo, it does not become, but alway is, a unity; the unity, that is to say, pertains to the objective as well as to the subjective. Presentations are not isolated particulars, some- how stru-ng together on a 'thread of consciousness'; however distinct and definite it may be, a presentation is still part of a larger whole. An absolutely new presentation, having no</page><page sequence="7">286 G. DAWES HICKS: sort of connexion with those that preceded it until the subject has synthesised it with them, is an invention of speculation, not a fact yielded by observation nor legitimately inferred therefrom. On the contrary, what we actually find, at' any given moment, is a certain whole of presentations, a 'field of consciousness,' psychologically one and continuous; and, at the next moment, not an entirely new field but a partial change within the old one. And proceeding backwards from this continuity as we are aware of it now, we are led, so Ward argued, alike by particular facts and by general con- siderations, to the notion of an objective continuum which, partly through the exercise of subjective selection, is gradu- ally differentiated, but which is always there as an unbroken whole. Advancing experience is, that is to say, like a pattern coming out bit by bit; but the pattern never resolves itself into a plurality of disconnected elements, having a distinct- ness such as the atoms of the physical world have been sup- posed to have. In Ward's view, then, the duality of subject and object is primordial; presentations are from the first given as objects, and they constitute for the percipient the objective world. But he would have it noted that the terms 'subjective' and ' objective' do not bear in epistemology the significance which they bear in psychology. Epistemologically considered, it might be said that the term 'objective' means so much of experience as is commion property, and 'subjective' so much as is private property; whereas psychologically considered 'subjective' refers to the owner and 'objective' to the pro- perty that he owns. In other words, what is psychologically objective is often treated as epistemologically subjective; and, although the latter treatment may be erroneous, the important problem in any case arises of determining how and when the objective world which is at first the individual subject's own presentations acquires the additional characteristics of uni- versality, of being the common object of a number of indi- vidual subjects. Ward's solution of the problem appears to have been that the transition comes about through the peculiar way in which we interpret the perceptive experience of other minds than our own. Through common thought and language, I am led to assume not merely that another man's experience is distinct from mine, but that it is in him in the form of sensations, perceptions, etc., conceived as sub- jective states. Notwithstanding the fact that my presenta- tions are for me objects, through a process of introjection I take his presentations to constitute an internal world in him, and naturally I come to apply a like conception to myself.</page><page sequence="8">THE PHILOSOPHY OF JAMES WARD. 287 Thus, the interpretation of perceiving in mne as an internal state referring to an object over and above the sense-pre- sented content is posterior to the recognition by me of other minds than my own. The passage from the 'immediate object' of individual experience to the 'mediate object' of common experience is effected, so Ward contended, mainly through means of intersubjective intercourse, and the various operations to which intersubjective intercourse gives rise. The common experience which results is, in truth, a continua- tion and extension of individual experience; but so far as the theoretical knowledge of nature is concerned, intersubjective intercourse leads, it may be said inevitably, to the omission of that reference to a conscious subject characteristic of the objects of individual experience. The one sun which is the common object of ten men looking at it, since it is not the peculiar object of any one of the ten, colues to be considered as independent of them all collectively, and indeed of any consciousness whatsoever. The argument I have just sketched called forth a consider- able amount of criticism when it was first put forward in the Gifford Lectures on Naturalism and Agnosticism, published in 1899. It was argued, for example, that no transition would be possible from a strictly individual experience-that if we start with an experience which is by definition solips- istic, then we can never get beyond it. In reply, Ward in- sisted that that had been an essential part of his argument throughout, that his argument had rested on the basis that "for individual experience, for psychology, our so-called 'sensations ' are not subjective, not 'feelings ' but objects, or rather changes in an objective continuum, environment, or non-ego ". If experience were ever exclusively subjective, it would be as much, if not more, a problem how we ever comne to be aware of ourselves as how we come to be aware of what is not ourselves. Not only, however, has every self its cor- relative not-self, but his contention had been that individual selves were not mutually shut off from one another like the cells of a hive, that, while they were exclusive as regards their standpoint, they were, in consequence of intersubjective intercourse, not exclusive as regards their boundaries. Ward had maintained that a subject is as necessary for universal as for individual experience, and that the philosophic problem of finding a unity in experience would be a hopeless one unless the transsubjective world could be regarded as standing in relation to a subject which is one and coritinuous with the subject of individual experience: Perhaps it is not altogether surprising that his argument in this connexion</page><page sequence="9">288 G. DAWES HICKS: should have given rise to misunderstanding. By some critics it was taken to be an attempt to establish the position that nature stood to God in a relation similar to that in which the presentational continuum stood to the individual subject, and the conclusion was drawn that the argument culminated in a metaphysic closely allied to that of Hegel. Such a culmination Ward had, however, by no means intended to make for. He did not mean to imply that the subject which is necessary for universal experience must necessarily be God. He was working rather with Kant's conception of conscious- ness in general, Bewusstsein 'iberhaupt, and his point was that universal experience is an experience that is peculiar to no one intelligence but common to all intjelligences. What he had. really been trying to show was that any individual who through intersubjective intercourse had advarnced to the stage of reason and self-consciousness, and had thus trans- cended the limits of individual perceptive experience, had ipso facto attained to a knowledge of nature or of the trans- subjective. When later on Ward came to the task of laying out systematically his own metaphysical conclusions in The Realim of Ends, a work which was given to the world in 1911, he had necessarily to make clear his attitude towards the Hegelian mode of thought which was at that time so strongly represented in the English Universities. With what has been called 'the essential message' of -Hegel-namely, that outside of spirit there is not, and cannot be, any reality-he was obviously in accord; so mluch his critical examination of naturalism and of metaphysical dualism had rendered mani- fest. But, as an outcome of long and careful scrutiny of Hegel's writings, he bad convinced himself that an idealism of the type it is customary to call 'absolute' is neither tenable in itself nor intellectually satisfying in its results. In the first place, it was well-nigh inevitable that a mind imbued as his was with a sense of the iinportance of testing philosophical generalisations by their compatibility or incompatibility with empirical details should look upon Hegel's idealism as having been too cheaply and easily won. Although, in embarking upon a 'thinking consideration of things' Hegel had, as a matter of fact, to begin with a 'voyage of discovery' and to take his start from this bewildering scene of particularity and contingency, yet his aim had been to exhibit the world as evolved by a necessary logical process from an ultimate unity, variously described as 'the Idea,' ' Spirit' or 'the Absolute'. The aim seemed to Ward to be an impossible aim, and the method by which it was sought to achieve it a perverted</page><page sequence="10">THE PHILOSOPHY OF JAMES WARD. 289 method. In philosophy, he urged, we cannot ' begin at the beginning,' with a ' One above' that is theoretically inac- cessible; the attempt to begin from the standpoint which only a completed philosophy would occupy is doomed, at the outset, to failure. The problem which the universe sets us is an inverse problem, what is 'first ad nos' is not 'first ad universum,' and we are bound to-set out upon our enterprise from where we actually are, that is to say, in mnediis rebus. And, in the second place, whenever the method had been followed of passing over the 'Many' in the hope of deducing them from an absolute 'One,' previously postulated on a priori grounds alone, that method had proved itself illusory; the unity from which a system of that sort starts had in- variably involved the. dissolution of the plurality which, in fact, it finds. If the Absolute, reached in thisway, be described as Mind or Spirit, then why this Mind or Spirit should in- volve finite minds or spirits, especially such as are 'in endless error hurled,' becomes inexplicable; the question why this Mind or Spirit, like the vo'nsv vo0orewa of Aristotle's divine being, should not. be completely self-sufficing, rendering arny- thing beside not only superfluous but even incompatible, presents us with a crux which no ingenuity is capable of surmounting. Hegel's Absolute seems at one time to be a perfect Self with no hint of aught beyond its own exhaustive self-consciousness, and at another time not to be a self at all, but only a realm of spiritual values, such as become realised, in art, religion and philosophy, by and through human subjects. True, then, to the method of empiricism, Ward started un- reservedly fromn the standpoint of what he named pluralism- the common-sense view of the world, the view which we all take when we are not philosophising. We find ourselves, that is to say, in the midst of a huge environment of persons, living creatures, and what we call 'things'. So far as our own concrete experience is concerned, the fundamental characteristic of it is that already dwelt upon of the duality in unity of subject and object. On the subjective side, the experiencing takes place in one individual centre; on the objective side, the experience is likewise one experience. The subject is continually in touch with one world, one environ- ment,-a world, an environment, in which there is continual change, process, development. Psychologically considered, a self-conscious subject had evinced itself as being a subject that attends to changes in the sensory-continuum, is, in con- sequence, either pleased or pained, and by voluntary atten- tion produces changes in the motor-continuum. So conceived, 20</page><page sequence="11">290 G. DAWES HICKS: the self-conscious subject can obviously never be a purely cognitive subject. Although an object must be cognised before it can be liked or disliked, yet it is to interesting objects that the individual mainly attends, and it is with these, there- fore, that he gradually acquires a closer and more precise acquaintance. The cognitive aspect of experience is rather, as indeed the etymology of the word suggests, one of experi- ment than of mere contemnplation. From this point of view, conation may be said, in a sense, to be more fundamental than cognition; we begin by trying and end by knowing. "Practice is the parent of theory and realisation the surest verification." The standpoint of pluralism, so understood, is, Ward insisted, the historical as contrasted with the naturalistic standpoint. In the world of history, we are ever in the presence of individual agents-individual agents who have no counterparts, and whose like, all in all, we shall never meet again. The things and events with which we have chiefly to deal are not natural phenomena-these form merely the setting, the scenery-but the acts and deeds of the dramatis personza themselves. Furthermore, what iminediately determines the individual's attitude towards natural objects is not the intrinsic nature of those objects, but their value for the experiencing individual in question; and as individuals vary so likewise do their interests and pUrSUits. In fine, the supreme category in the world of history is the category of good or worth, and by this standard even natural things and events are appraised. So, too, when we extend the range of history, and include within it nature in its progressive development, it is still the meaning and purpose of its things and processes we are seeking to discover. Accordingly, Ward's first endeavour was to see how far it is possible to advance towards a metaphysical conception of the universe without deserting this standpoint of pluralism. One step forward the considerations just pressed enable us, he thought, at once to take. A consistent pluralism is bound to evince itself as a species of panpsychism or of monadism, according to which matter has got to be interpreted as but the manifestation of the interaction of perceptive and appetitive entities or monads. If the atoms of physical theory be ulti- mately real, they must, that is to say, be regarded as possess- ing some, however rudimentary, psychical properties, some individual peculiarities; and thus the historical world will be the whole. This step was certainly a momentous one; and Ward threw the burden of justifying it mainly on the principle of continuity. The modern biologist is, he insisted, already assured that the region of life extends far into that which was</page><page sequence="12">THE PHILOSOPHY OF JAMES WARD. 291 once supposed to be the realm of the inanimate, and there is nothing to suggest that the biologist has yet reached the limits of life. On the conltrary, if there are no gaps in nature, if, as Leibniz put it, 'nature never makes leaps,' then we are warranted in assuming that all the ultimate realities of nature are, in Spinoza's phrase, animata, though in diverse degrees. Indeed, apart from the principle of continuity, that conclusion would seem to be forced upon us through the reflexion that an entity which can neither do nor suffer, which is nothing per se, would be equivalent to no entity at all. Nature was, then, to be construed as a plurality of conative and interacting individuals, the stage of development of each being indicated by the range and complexity of the correspondence between it and its environment. No one of these individuals will be presented to another as an object of experience in such a way as to enable the latter to realise what the former is in its actual essence. The objects of each individual's experience will be the appearances to him of such existent beings other than himself. The 'immediate objects' of perception, presentations, will be, that is to say, not subjective modifications of the perceiving mind, but ways in which, under suitable conditions, com- plexes of psychical entities reveal themselves to the perceiving nind, and such 'appearances' will be dependent on the exist- ence both of the percipient and of the other entities. On the basis of a pluralism of this kind it is possible, so Ward tried to show, to proceed a long way in explaining the objective order of the world. In the first place, instead of being compelled to assume a number of natural laws 'in force' from the outset-always an embarrassing assumption for any theory of evolution,-we can offer an intelligible account of the way in which natural laws are gradually evolved. What underlies the uniformity and regularity of the historical world is the spontaneity of living agents; and it is reasonable to conclude that under- lying the uniformity and regularity of the so-called physical world there is likewise spontaneity. So far as human agents are concerned, we know that habit, dexterity, and routine do not precede experience, but arise in the course of it; so far as nature as a whole is concerned, we may surmise that there is a similar process at work whereby what is originally spontane- ous and tentative eventually becomes automatic and regular. In regard to both, it is allowable to conceive of the habit formed, the customs fixed, as constituting at every stage the general trend of things, within which future possibilities lie, while what is still to do implies further spontaneity and growth, fresh experiments to be made, with their usual</page><page sequence="13">*292 G. DAWES HICKS: sequence of trial and error and possible ultimate success. In that case, physical laws may be regarded as of the nature of statistical averages, such as frequently conceal the diversity and spontaneity of animated beings when they and their actions are taken en masse. Thus, then, orderliness and re- gularity so far as it is real will be the result of the conduct of individuals not its presupposition, and so far as it is apparent, it will be due to the statistical constancy of large num-bers. Ward was here applying the conception, which he had emphasised in the Encyclop6edia article, of automatic actions as being in truth 'secondarily automatic,' as degraded or mechanical forms of conative actions. Some of the objections which have been raised to this theory of the evolution of natural laws are not, I think, really relevant. Pringle-Pattison has, for exalmple, contended that it virtually amounts to a doctrine of the regularities of the universe having arisen out of a condition of pure chance and chaos.' But Ward had ex- pressly guarded himself from being supposed to mean any- thing of the kind. Everything at the start, he had urged, may be considered as having been inchoate, but nothing as having been chaotic, " unless inexperience and innocence are the same as anarchy and original sin ". His point was not that there had once been no uniformity at all-the very fact that amongst mionads of the kind contemplated there would be a very large measure of resemblance would itself secure a certain degree of uniformity-but that there would not be that amount of uniformity implied in the terra 'natural law'. "Every act of a conative agent is," he had written, " determined by- what muay, in a wide sense, be called-a motive, and motiva- tion is incomlpatible with chance, though in the concrete it be not reducible to law." And, after all, the argument from statistics, intended to show that the uniformity on the whole which appears in physical movements is an average, seems to be an argument which modern physicists are inclined, on purely experimental grounds, to endorse. In the second place, Ward maintained-and here, as in so many other parts of his work, his knowledge of biology served him in good stead-that by 'evolution' is not meant in mnodern science what the terin literally implies, an unfolding of what is already involved. By 'evolution' the modern scientific man means what would be better expressed by the term 'epigenesis,' the formation by progressive integration of what is genuinely new. From the pluralistic point of view, evolution must imply synthesis, and real synthesis is always I The Idea of God, p. 184, sqq.</page><page sequence="14">THE PHILOSOPHY OF JAMES WARD. 293 creative synthesis. Just as the tinbre of a musical note is more than tne sum of its constituent tones, and a melody more than the sum of its separate notes, so, according to the Darwinian theory, a new organism is more than the unfolding of the sum of parts contained in the embryo. In it, those parts have been gradually organised in such a way that a product has resulted which Was not preformed in the germ. Here, as likewise, of course, in reference to interaction, W;rd's monadism differed markedly from that of Leibniz, which was dominated throuahout by the thought of develop- ment as the gradual explicating of what is implicit from the first, a doctrine which, while appropriate to an absolutist philosophy, seemed to Ward hopelessly irreconcilable with pluralism. In short, by the conception of ' creative synthesis,' Ward meant, I take it, very much what Lloyd Morgan has since called 'emergence,'-the advent of new and, before the event, unpredictable characteristics. But it was, he thought, in the developmnent of human society that evolution, in the sense of epigenesis, is most conspicuously manifested. What emerge there are not new entities but new values; these values not only tend to be conserved but to prepare the way for still higher unities and worthier ideals, and we can assign no limit to such process. One of the problems which Ward's monadistic theory en- abled him effectively to handle was the problem of the relation of body and mind. After the manner of Leibniz, he pictured an individual organism as consisting of a dominant monad in a special relation to a group of subordinate monads, the dominant monad constituting the 'mind' of the organism, the subordinate ones, although themselves inferior 'minds,' constituting the body. The subordinate monads he conceived to stand to the dominant monad in a functional relation as ministering subjects. This relation, while, in a way, analogous to that between an instrument and the worker who uses it, is yet essentially different from the latter relation, for, although the worker may become so accustomed to his inistrument as to attend only to what it does and not to what it is, it yet remains an object for him. But the functional relation of the subordinate to the domitnant monad is a relation not of object to subject but of subject to subject,-the kind of im- mediate rapport which is implied in what is called 'telepathy'. We can only gain some idea of the nature of this 'sympathetic rapport' from the illustrations we find of it 'writ large' in social institutions. The officials in the post-office are, of course, persons; but, in their official capacity, they subserve a function similar to that of subordinate monads,-the service</page><page sequence="15">294 G. DAWES HICKS: they render to the community is, for the ordinary citizen, the main concern. Neither in their personalties, nor in the technical details of their work has he any interest; he con- fidently relies upon each bit of work of theirs being performed, and so long as everything proceeds smoothly, his attention can be confined to the things which through them he is made aware of. And in a like manner, the dominant monad mriay be conceived a-s beina apprehensive through means of the subordinate monads of what lies beyond them; the subordinate monads as being diaphanous to the dominant monad and the 'things' of which they convey information as being to it opaque. The one relation is that of the intersubjective kind, the other of the kind we call cognitive. Not only so. We can understand, also, how, with increasing complexity of organisation, the process of mediation tends continually to increase how functions originally controlled by the dominant monad devolve upon the subordinates, and how thus the range of habitual processes, which for the dominant monad lapse into subconsciousness, widens and extends. I revert, however, to the central thought. Given a world of originally independent psychical entities, each struggling for self-preservation, the problem had been to render intel- ligible the way in which these might organise, themselves into such an orderly and connected whole as nature exhibits. And that problem, Ward claimed, had by no means proved itself to be intractable. On the contrary, the general lines along which its solution might be sought had been more or less successfully traced. But in trying to solve that problem, a characteristic set of other problems are thrown upon our hands which, from the standpoint of pluralism alone, obstinately resist solution. At both its upper and lower limits, namely, pluralism pure and simple leads to an impasse. (a) If, in the universe, there be, as science practically obliges us to think, innumerable orbs besides this- small planet teeming with life, it is difficult, or rather impossible, to form any idea of how these could ever constitute a commonwealth; without some supreme Mind, the universe would remain a plurality of worlds, each isolat'ed from the others, and no ultimate unity would be achievable. We might, it is true, in conformity with the principle of continuity, posit a higher order of intelligences, and thus be led on to conceive a Highest o'f all. S3uch a supreme Being would, however, only be one of the 'Many'; he would in no sense be absolute, nor could he be thou2ht of as either the ground or the creator of the universe. (b) At the lower limit, the perplexity of a first beginning confronts us. As we trace the evolution of the</page><page sequence="16">THE PHILOSOPHY OF JAMES WARD. '295 world back to its earliest conditions, we seem driven to suppose a vast multiplicity of ' slumbering monads,' to use the phrase of Leibniz; and the question arises as to how the awakening could ever be brought about. Since monads would all be so far homogeneous, we appear here to approach a pure potentiality, that would require a Primum movens to quicken it into life. These considerations suffice of themselves to indicate that if the theistic postulate can be sustained pluralism would be relieved of just those difficulties that are for it the most for- midable. Nor is that all. The course of the argument so far had been to show that in the economy of nature there is to be discerned a tendency to conserve the organic. But is there also to be discerned as operative therein a principle of the conservation of values, such as would prevent a rational self-conscious mind from lapsing back into a monad of inferior grade ? If the monads be, as according to pluralism they are, ultimate realities, no one of them can, it is true, sink int3 nothingness. But a self-conscious monad is depen- dent upon a group of subordinate monads, and, when this group is as such dissolved, although the monad to which it has been subservient will persist as the same metaphysical entity, it bv no means follows that it will persist as the same identical person. Moreover, this planet seems destined to enter, when a certain stage of its history has been reached, upon a period of inevitable decline, and that would appear to involve that the higher monads will revert to the condition of the lower. Progress, then, although guaranteed up to a certain point., would be on the whole precluded. "In a word, without such spiritual continuity as theism alone seems able to ensure, it looks as if a pluralistic world were condemned to a Sisyphean task. Per aspera ad astra may be its motto, but facilis descensuzs Aver4o seems to be its fate." Both on theoretical and on practical grounds, pluralism, then, would appear to point beyond itself. But Ward would not admit that a pluralism that did not terminate in theism is necessarily self-contradictory. It would be, he thought, perfectly justifiable for a 'radical empiricist' to take the world aJs he finds it,-that is to say, as a plurality of in- dividuals unified in and through their mutual intercourse- and to refuse to proceed further. Such a theory might leave us, as Lotze said, with an inexhaustible wonder, but then the universe is an inexhaustible wonder, and a wonder is not a contradiction. If, however, a pluralist does make the ap- proach to theism, he will do so not with any idea of discarding his pluralism but with a view to complete it. And Ward's</page><page sequence="17">296 G. DAWES HICKS: contention was that theism does afford a means of providing pluralism with a supplement of which it stands in need-on the theoretical side, with an ultimate ground for the exist- ence of the monads, such as reason seems to necessitate, and on the practical side with a unity of meaning or end such as the moral consciousness seems to demand. In one respect, he allowed, theism introduces into pluralism an essential modification. God cannot be legitimately thought of as related to the 'Many' in a way resembling that in which any one of the 'Many' is related to any other. The 'Many' must be conceived as dependent upon God, and as existing somehow in and throuugh God. The idea of 'creation' evidently occasioned Ward no small amount of trouble and uncertainty, but he handled it with considerable subtlety and skill. He had, indeed, already cleared away what would have proved an insurmountable obstacle to the line of thought followed by him; that is to say, he had no need to account for the coming into being of an inert matter. He felt himself justified, therefore, in at once dismissing the crude and con- tradictory notion of a 'making out of nothing,' and the almost equally contradictory notion of reality as having been brought into being. "If creation means anything, it means some- thing so far involved in the divine essence that we are entitled to say as Hegel was fond of saying, that 'without the world God is not God'." In other words, the notion of 'cause' is, in this context, entirely inapplicable: creation is not to be brought under the category of transeunt causation, because that relates to change in existence, nor is it to be brought under the category of immnanent causation, as being a change in God, because that would mean abandoning the position that God is God only as being creative. To speak, then, of God as the Creator of the world must be taken to signify that God is the ratio essendi of the woeld's being. On the other hand, however, the notion of ground is not to be interpreted as implying that the world is merely a way in which the Absolute comes to self-consciousness. The 'Many' no less than God must possess independent reality; from the plura- listic point of view, God can never be the Absolute, the only Absolute that pluralism can admit is that which God and the world would constitute. Creation, therefore, certainlv in- volves limitation; in determining the world, God must like- wise determine himself. But in determining himself, God is not to be thought of as differentiating or fractionating himself into the world. How God creates the world and thereby limits himself we cannot, by the very nature of the case, represent to ourselves; since we are ex hypothesi creatures,</page><page sequence="18">THE PHILOSOPHY OF JAMES WARD. 297 to experience what the process of creation is like is obviously beyond our power. A faint and distant analogy may per- chance be found in what we call the creations of genius, which we regard as the spontaneous output of a free spirit that embodies itself in its work. Though the man of genius loves his work and lives in it, he is still distinct from it and greater than it; and it too, though he knows it through and through, is distinct from him. The analogy fails, it is true, just where our real difficulties begin, for there is an impassable gulf between the origination of something relatively new within the world and the absolute creation of the world itself. Nevertheless, this difference need not imply utter disparity; there is nothing to prevent us applying to the divine experi- ence the distinction of will and presentation and assuming that these are no less inseparable in such experience than they are in our own. There would, therefore, be no sudden resolve to create, followed by the carrying of the resolve into effect; divine creation can only be continuous creation. "If God is the ground of the world at all he is its ground always as an active, living Spirit, not as a merely everlasting, changeless and indifferent centre, round which it simply whirls." The sort of notion that Ward was attempting to frame of creation comes out perhaps most clearly in his treatment of the problem of freedom and 'foreknowledge'. Creation, being ex hypotihesi the calling into being of individuial agents, centres of spontaniety, cannot, he argued, be a process of determining beforehand exactly what they shall be and do. "Unless creators are created nothing is really created." If there are to be creators other than God, then manifestly that does mean that God cannot be as though they were not; he must be limited and determined by them. Such limitation would be, however, essentially self-limitation; and if it be said that an omnipotent being could not thus limit himself, the reply is that such an assertion amounts to nothing short of a trans- parent contradiction in terms. Contingency in the world there must be if the world consists of conative agents, but it is ridiculous to confuse that contingency with chance; it is, on the contrary, the contingency from which the established order of the world has proceeded. It does imply that there are future facts outside the range of even omniscient know- ledge. It does imply that to each created creator some measure of initiation has been assigned, though obviously not an unlimited initiative. But it does not imply that God will always be, or ever be, liable to surprises. The total possibili- ties may be fixed, but within this totality, any particular</page><page sequence="19">298 G. DAWES HICKS: possibility will be open. Otherwise, instead of becoming intelligible, history would turn out to be essentially unintel- ligible; a world in which every event was predestined would both necessitate a rational ground and be irreconcilable with one. The problems for which human reason ordinarily seeks to find a solution through the ideas of God, freedom and im- mortality are, as Ward felt very vividly, real problems, pro- blems which are put by reason itself, and in respect to which, therefore, we may be sure that a solution sufficient in itself, though not perhaps sufficient in the way we may chance to desire, is to be had. With one of them-that of freedom- Ward held that our thought is fully competent to deal. The problem had, no doubt, often been wrongly stated. The phrase 'freedomn of the will' was, for example, thoroughly misleading. There is no will that wills but only an indi- vidual subject that wills, and the real question was whether in willing an individual subject is free. But, in Ward's view, freedom is a psychological fact. That the fact had often been misconstrued-as, for instance, when it is represented as the 'liberty of indifference '-he was, again, ready to admit; but any metaphysical theory that allowed no place for the fact or attempted to explain it away seemed to him, through that very circumstance, to betray its falsity. On the other band, the existence of a personal God and of a life hereafter we could not, he urged, demonstrate as truths of knowledge. Here we were thrown back upon faith, and the important thing was to see wherein faith and knowledge differ, as also how they are related. The source of faith lies, he insisted, in our conative nature; had we no need of God we should never seek him, were life not dear to us we should never look beyond the grave. But the cause on which the existence of knowing as a fact depends, if not the source from which knowledge proceeds, is likewise our conative nature. We acquire knowledge by merely doing, and we acquire it solely by doing; experience is the process of becoming expert by experiment. From first to last experience exhibits as opera- tive in it throughout a sort of unscientific trustfulness, which ultimately either justifies itself or fails to do so at the bar of the critical intellect. It is only in striving for what is good that we learn what is true; and it is only because we are in- terested in the 'whv' that we inquire about the 'what'. So far, there is nothing unique in religious faith at all; it is just the crowning phase of a long and ascending series. Science rests, in the long run, upon a postulate that is but methodised primitive credulity'; its real categories-substance, cause,</page><page sequence="20">THE PHILOSOPHY OF JAMES WARD. 299 and end-are anthropomorphic in character, projections of ourselves. If, then, through the limitations of our know- ledge, we cannot scientifically verify the fundamental beliefs of religion, what recourse is left to us? Only that, Ward answered, of testing them by their success or failure. And here the universality, the survival of religion, its advance with the increasing morality and intelligence of mankind, to say nothing of the way in which it has largely furthered such advance, is surely, he contended, a strong argument in its sup- port. We can only 'justify' faith in God and immortality by demonstrating its worth in the living experience of the be- lieving subject. For philosophy, there remains, however, the task of deciding whether such faith is or is not more in ac- cord with the postulate of the unity and rationality of all ex- perience than its opposite can possibly be. Does philosophic reflection force us to recognise that nature becomes intelligible only if the knower and the known are not utterly disparate, but that they alike rest upon one ultimate ground ? Does it find that evolution becomes intelligible, only if' the groaning and travailing of the whole creation' is not doomed to be for ever subjected to vanity? If so, though it has not shown that these propositions of faith are true, it has shown that it is rational and reasonable to believe in their truth. Here I may bring my task to an end. Ward was in the habit of describing his philosophy as idealistic or spiritualistic, meaning thereby that it was an attempt to- interpret- the world in terms of Mind. But it was an idealism that re- mained throughout on an empirical basis.</page></plain_text>
