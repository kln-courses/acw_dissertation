SOMMER Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208-4050 The reception of literary works is usually accompanied by an uneasiness about their reduction to meaning. ... Reading itself becomes the project: we read to understand what is involved in reading as a form of life, rather than to resolve what is read into glossy ideas. As in collage or conceptual art, mean- ings (Rilke's "gedeutete Welt") are part of the medium of art, part of its materiel. -Geoffrey Hartman' -Ben Bag-Bag, m. Abot 5:25 Numbers 11:4-35 represents an unusual sort of composite narrative.The two texts it encompasses tell stories that are, as far as plot goes, entirely unre- lated. One describes Moses' and YHWH's anger with the people, who com- plained that their diet lacked variety. The other recounts the overflowing of Moses' spirit onto the elders. The tensions in Numbers 11 surpass those found in most redacted texts in the Pentateuch, which typically contain multiple ver- sions of a single story differing mainly in plot details. For example, it is clear that both the P and J texts in Genesis 6-9 tell the same story, even though they differ regarding various specific issues (e.g., P claims that Noah took two of each animal onto the ark, while J maintains that two of some animals but seven of others went on board). Occasionally two distinct but similar stories are com- bined: the narratives describing Korah's rebellion and the mutiny led by An earlier draft of this paper was presented to the Pentateuch section at the 1995 meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature. I benefited from the discussion there, especially from challeng- ing observations from David Carr and Erhard Blum. Marc Brettler commented incisively on an earlier draft of this essay. 1 Geoffrey Hartman, Criticism in the Wilderness: The Study of Literature Today (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1980) 272. 601</page><page sequence="2">602 Journal of Biblical Literature Dathan and Abiram in Numbers 16-17 were originally separate, but they share enough that they were easily combined into one story, notwithstanding discrep- ancies that remain. In Numbers 11, however, the incongruity is far greater: the components of the chapter diverge not regarding a story's particulars but regarding what story is being told altogether. Such a degree of incongruity demands attention. By bringing together two disparate stories, the redactor of Numbers 11 compels readers to contemplate several related motifs (in particular, images of Moses and of divinely sent T~n), but bars them from achieving interpretative closure. Thus a study of redactional technique in this chapter broadens our understanding of the activity of the figures who formed the biblical texts as we know them. It suggests that pentateuchal editors at times structured narratives to follow a logic of theme rather than one concerned with linear plot, and that narrative coherence (as opposed to thematic juxtaposition) was not always a goal of ancient editors.2 This finding has important implications for the practice of redaction criticism and for its connections with other forms of analysis. Attention to the redactional technique of this chapter generates a literary read- ing that is open-ended precisely because it is sensitive to diachronic layers in the text. Further, the sort of literary analysis (in both senses) I attempt here engenders greater understanding of postbiblical commentary. Classical com- mentators on this chapter are eisegetical not in the sense that they impose their views on the ancient text but in the sense that they read the Moses of one pen- 2 This redactional practice, it should be noted, is not unique to Numbers 11; we find it in Exodus 32-34 as well. A kindred analysis of that text must await further study. Analogous techniques have been studied by Robert Alter and Edward Greenstein, who argue that different versions of a given story have been combined in such a way that each one retains some identity. The finished text, they show, is deliberately and productively uneven. See Alter's discussion of what he terms "composite artistry" in The Art of Biblical Narrative (New York: Basic Books, 1981) 131-54; and Greenstein's article "An Equivocal Reading of the Sale of Joseph," in Literary Interpretations of Biblical Narratives (ed. K. R. R. Gros Louis; 2 vols.; Nashville: Abing- don, 1974, 1982) 2.114-25, 306-10. Note especially Greenstein's statement regarding Genesis 37: "If the text that we accept as the final product contains discernible discrepancies between one verse and another, we do not presume that the redactor had attempted to remove them but failed. Rather, we allow that the redactor may have been well aware of the inconsistencies and desired to leave them in the text" (p. 117). The problem Alter and Greenstein confront (to wit, Why have inconsistent versions of a story been combined?) is all the greater in Numbers 11, where the two stories are not merely inconsistent but entirely unrelated in terms of plot and, as we shall see, opposing in terms of theme. A similar situation is described by Tzvi Abusch in his study of the neo-Assyrian version of the Gilgamesh Epic, "Ishtar's Proposal and Gilgamesh's Refusal: An Interpretation of The Gilgamesh Epic, Tablet 6, Lines 1-79," HR 26 (1986) 143-87. Abusch shows that even though the presence of the epic's final tablet is incoherent in terms of plot (Why is Enkidu described as alive so long after his death?), the addition of the tablet contributes to the discourse on the neo-Assyrian version's main concern (the place of the god Gilgamesh in the divine hierarchy). Thus, in that first-millennium text, as in Numbers 11, redactors were concerned with a logic of theme rather than one of plot.</page><page sequence="3">Sommer: The Redaction of Numbers 11 603 tateuchal source into the other. Traditional interpreters continue the exegetical work of the redactor, since the insertion of one story into the other changes the meaning of both, so that redaction results in inner-biblical exegesis. Conse- quently, the work of the redactor and that of classical commentators are mutu- ally enlightening. More can be said about the impossibility of interpretive closure in this text as it relates to both recent narratology and classical commentary, but first it will be necessary to proceed with a source-critical analysis and close reading of the text. I. Sources in Numbers 11:4-35 Num 11:4-35 is readily divided into the following narrative sections: I. Vv. 4-6: The people complain about the lack of meat in the desert: there is only manna to eat. II. Vv. 7-9: The manna is described. III. V. 10: Moses and God hear the complaint; both are displeased. IV. Vv. 11-15: Moses complains to God about the difficulty of leading such a people and the impossibility of finding enough meat for them. He asserts that he would rather die than continue in such a job. V. Vv. 16-17: God tells Moses to gather together seventy elders, who will receive some of Moses' spirit (nn) of prophecy. VI. Vv. 18-24a: God tells Moses that he will give the people meat for a month, until they are sick of it. Moses asks God if he will really find enough meat to satisfy six hundred thousand people in a desert. God asks if anything could be too dif- ficult for God. Moses passes this information on to the people. VII. Vv. 24b-25: Moses gathers the seventy elders outside the camp around the tent. God descends on the tent and puts part of Moses' spirit (nn) on the seventy, who break into prophesying and then stop. VIII. Vv. 26-30: Eldad and Medad, who remained in the camp, also break into prophesying. A lad informs Moses, and Joshua bids Moses to stop them. Moses tells Joshua not to be jealous on his behalf and expresses a wish that all the Israelites could become prophets. IX. Vv. 31-35: A wind (nn) from the sea brings quail, which the people gather with ease and in abundance. While they eat, a plague breaks out, killing a large number.</page><page sequence="4">604 Journal of Biblical Literature These sections often fail to link up with each other. God's promise to give his spirit to the seventy elders (V) responds only vaguely to Moses' complaint that he cannot feed the people (IV). The prophesying of the seventy (VII-VIII) has no relation to the plague brought on by quails, which follows it (IX).3 Each aspect of the story-prophecy and plague-could be a story of its own. Indeed, the story concerning a plague brought on by quails that the people had yearned for does appear by itself, without reference to the story about prophecy and elders, in Ps 78:17-30 and, more briefly, in Ps 106:14-15. On grounds of plot alone, then, we can divide Num 11:4-35 into two strands, which were identified by scholars such as S. R. Driver, J. Carpenter and G. Harford-Battersby, and G. B. Gray a century ago.4 In sections I, II, III, IV, VI, and IX (vv. 4-15, 18-24a, 31-35), the people complain that they lack meat, provoking Moses' aggrieved speech to God and his demand for death before duty. God sends the people so much of what they crave that many of them die. We might term this story, "Moses, the people, and plague," or simply "the A narrative."5 Sections V, VII, and VIII (w. 16-17, 24b-30) constitute another story in which God tells Moses to gather seventy elders, so that Moses will share his prophetic spirit with them outside the camp. Not only do the elders outside the camp prophesy, but Eldad and Medad in the camp do so as well, to Joshua's dismay and Moses' apparent delight. We might term this story, "Moses, the elders, and prophecy," or "the B narrative." That two Psalms con- tain versions of the story of "Moses, the people, and plague" without any refer- 3 Martin Noth notes that the prophesying of the seventy "is very strange in its present con- text. Moses is supposed to be 'relieved of his burden' (verses 14-17). How this goal is achieved by putting the 70 elders in a state of ecstasy is difficult to understand; moreover, nothing is said on this subject" (Numbers [OTL; London: SCM, 1968] 89). See also Jacob Licht, A Commentary on the Book of Numbers (in Hebrew; 3 vols.; Jerusalem: Magnes, 1985-95) 2.17, 27. Harold Fisch makes a similar observation in "'Eldad and Medad are Prophesying in the Camp'-Structuralist Analysis of Numbers XI," in Studies in Bible and Exegesis, vol. 2 (in Hebrew; presented to Yehuda Elitzur; ed. Uriel Simon; Ramat Gan: Bar Ilan University Press, 1986) 48. 4 See J. Carpenter and G. Harford-Battersby, The Hexateuch according to the Revised Ver- sion (London: Longmans, Green, 1900) 2.201-3; S. R. Driver, An Introduction to the Literature of the Old Testament (Edinburgh: T &amp; T Clark, 1913) 62; G. B. Gray, A Critical and Exegetical Com- mentary on Numbers (ICC 4; Edinburgh: T &amp; T Clark, 1912) 101-2. 5 Carpenter and Harford (Hexateuch, 2.202) and Gray (Numbers, 102; cf. 107-8) attribute vv. 10b-12 to the same hand that created the plague story but suggest that they were added to the A narrative secondarily from some other context. They argue that Moses' anger in these verses is inappropriately directed against YHWH rather than the people (see esp. Carpenter and Harford, 2.201 n. 10b). However, we should not be surprised to find that Moses' anger is directed both at the people who torment him and at the God who had the temerity to put him in charge of them. Indeed, the idea that an angry man lashes out in several directions is quite understandable and in this case even justifiable. Moses' speech in vv. 10b-15 contains no discontinuities or gaps that sug- gest the need for a source-critical division. Carpenter and Harford also speculate that v. 14 may have been added by a redactor, though again it should be noted that Moses' comment here fits its context without any problems.</page><page sequence="5">Sommer: The Redaction of Numbers 11 605 ence to the story of "Moses, the elders, and prophecy" provides empirical sup- port for this source-critical analysis. (It is unlikely that the narrative in Psalm 78 is based on the pentateuchal text. Jacob Milgrom points out that in Ps 78:27, the quail fall within the camp itself, while in Num 11:31, they fall outside the camp.6 The variation suggests that the Psalm and Numbers depend on an older tradition but not on each other.7) The A narrative contains vocabulary items and narrative elements typical of J texts (e.g., ln 8rZl and -= n*b; see Gen 6:8; 18:13; 44:34; and Exod 33:12-13).8 Many details of the B story (e.g., the location of the Mrw outside the camp, the role of Joshua) link it with texts typically denoted by the siglum E.9 To be sure, some recent critics have rejected the classical Documentary Hypothesis and its notions of discrete documents spanning the Torah. Further, even among adherents to the classical theory, the notion that E represents a coherent document distinct from J (as opposed to a series of supplements, for example) has attracted disfavor.'0 Therefore it is crucial to note that the source- 6 See Jacob Milgrom, Numbers (Jewish Publication Society Torah Commentary 4; Philadel- phia: Jewish Publication Society, 1989) 92. 7 Similarly, the descriptions of the seven plagues against the Egyptians in Psalms 78 and 105 do not derive from the pentateuchal sources; the Psalms and the pentateuchal sources are indepen- dently utilizing older traditions. See the detailed analysis in Samuel Loewenstamm, The Tradition of the Exodus in its Development (in Hebrew; Jerusalem: Magnes, 1968) 33-42, esp. 34 n. 33a. s See Gray, Numbers, 107. For further examples of the text's affinities with other J texts, see the margins of Carpenter and Harford, Hexateuch, 2.201-3. See also, e.g., J. Sturdy, Numbers (Cambridge Commentary, New English Bible 4; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976) 85. 9 The location of the 7rtN outside the camp (v. 27) corresponds to E's earlier description in Exod 33:7-11 of the ?,rlt's placement. In both J and P, however, the tent was located within the camp (see the comments of Gray, Numbers, 115). The figure called n-r -o I: InDom' accom- panies Moses outside the tent here (Num 11:28). Since he is not one of the elders, his presence would seem odd here had we not been told in a previous E text (Exod 33:11) that a figure called nt 111 1': YD90' serves Moses outside the tent. Joshua is called a nrm of Moses only in E verses-viz., in the two mentioned above and in Exod 24:13. The institution of seventy elders is known from the E passage in Exodus 18. The description of God's descent in a cloud (pI) matches descriptions elsewhere in E, such as Exod 33:10.

Whether the A and B narratives here belong to larger documents run- ning through the Pentateuch (or Tetrateuch or Hexateuch) has little bearing on my source-critical analysis. Although comparisons of A and B to other texts identified as belonging to J and E respectively may prove illuminating, my find- ings do not depend on those comparisons. More recent scholars have proposed alternative divisions of Num 11:4-35 that are extremely unlikely; indeed, comparison of their work with that of turn- of-the-century scholars provides a fine example of the devolution of source crit- icism from the careful, well-supported findings of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to the unfortunate hypercriticism that has marked much source-critical work in the past seven or so decades. Martin Noth sees our text as a J story concerning complaint and plague to which several elaborations have been added, to wit: the last two verses of Moses' complaint and God's order to gather seventy elders (vv. 14-17), the story of the gathering of the elders (vv. 24b-25, 30), and the story of Eldad and Medad (vv. 26-29).11 He views v. 14-15 as belonging to the same fragment or elaboration as vv. 16-17; these verses are distinct from the older story, which is interrupted after v. 13 and resumes at v. 18. Thus, for Noth God's command to gather elders should clearly respond to Moses' complaint regarding the burden of leadership, since they stem from a single hand. But the elders whom Moses gathers were functioning as political leaders before this event. According to v. 16, these men already served as the nation's elders and officials. Thus, the point of gathering them is not to introduce them to the burden of leadership for the first time, as Noth's assertion implies. Rather, it is to allow those who already share Moses' political burden to experience prophecy. 12 In light of the elders' preexistent status as leaders, Noth's suggestion that vv. 14-17 are a single elaboration rather than part of two originally independent stories loses force: an elaboration ought to make sense, but vv. 16-17 fail to follow on what comes before them. Granted, vv. 14 and 17b share two vocabulary items (the root K""i and the word i"1), but this similarity need not indicate that they stem from the same hand. The redac- tor may have used a coincidental parallel in the vocabulary of A in v. 14 and B in v. 17 to connect the stories; or the redactor may have inserted either v. 17b or v. 14 (or both) in order to create a verbal link between these otherwise unrelated tales. Further, v. 14 ("I cannot bear this burden alone") follows quite readily 11 See Noth, Numbers, 83-91 (where he does not distinguish the provenance of wvv. 24b-25, 30 from that of w. 26-29); and his History ofPentateuchal Traditions (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Pren- tice Hall, 1972) 128-29 (where he does so distinguish, and where he suggests [p. 128 n. 360] that J brought together his own narrative with the additions in vv. 14-17 and vv. 24b-30). 12 Our B text in vv. 16-17 may presume that we know these men to be leaders on the basis of Exod 18:12-27, which, like B, is widely attributed to E (see Carpenter and Harford, Hexateuch, 2.108-9).</page><page sequence="7">Sommer: The Redaction of Numbers 11 607 from v. 13 ("Where can I find enough meat for this whole nation?"); v. 16, on the other hand, introduces a new issue (the prophesying of the seventy elders, whose connection with Moses' complaint is never fully clarified). The location of the source-critical divide, then, is most likely at the end of v. 15. Noth's theory is weaker than that of the older scholars because he divides the story into an original J story, which has some lacunae, and fragments added to it, none of which quite works on its own as a narrative, and none of which makes this chapter work clearly either. The earlier critics, on the other hand, find two complete stories, each of which can be taken as a coherent whole.13 One of these stories (A) also appears in Psalm 78, which is not dependent on the Pentateuch (as we saw above). The other story (B) reads especially well alongside the narratives that precede and follow the passage under considera- tion (as we shall see below). Noth's theory is possible, but the theory that assigns all verses to stories that work on their own is more likely. David Jobling, though not primarily concerned with diachronic or source- critical issues, also divides Numbers 11 into a quail story and an elders story that match Noth's source-critical division. Whereas I attribute vv. 14-15 to A and vv. 16-17 to B, Jobling sees all ofvv. 14-17 as belonging to the elders story. This elders story, according to Jobling, is problematic: "the narrative takes sev- eral baffling turns, and reaches, at the surface level, no satisfactory conclusion. ... The elders do not share Moses' leadership. They share his spirit of prophecy, 13 Blum denies that what I call A works as a fully self-contained story, pointing out that v. 18 presupposes that God is already talking, which we know only from B's comment in v. 16 (Komposi- tion, 83 n. 169). But this observation hardly overturns the sense that A works on its own; when the redactor combined A and B, the original A introduction to God's statement in v. 18 was no longer necessary and may have been left out. Several critics see B as a series of glosses or elaborations added to the quail story, rather than as an originally independent narrative (Blum, Komposition, 82-83, and see additional references there; Noth, History of Pentateuchal Traditions, 129 n. 64, who furthermore views vv. 26-29 as an addition to w. 24-25; Aaron Schart, Mose und Israel im Konflikt: Eine Redaktionsgeschichtliche Studie zu den Wiistenerzdhlungen [OBO 98; G6ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1990] 162-66, 214-16). Against this approach, one can simply read w. 16-17, 24b-30 to see how well they work as a story with an abstract (w. 16-17), complicating action (v. 26), resolution (v. 29), and coda (v. 30; on the basic structure of an integrated narrative, see Adele Berlin, Poetics and the Interpretation of Biblical Narrative [Sheffield: Almond Press, 1983] 101-10). Moreover, reading these verses along with 11:1-3 and chap. 12 further demonstrates that the B story works as part of a larger whole inde- pendent of the A story; on the connection between B and the texts immediately before it and after it, see my comments in the next section. Incidentally, Schart's division of the chapter into a J layer and a D layer is nearly identical with my delineation of A and B stories respectively, except in two respects. His D layer also includes w. 11apl-12 and w. 14-15; and he describes this D layer as a gloss to the J layer rather than as an originally independent narrative. However, he gives no clear reason for removing w. 11a1-12 and w. 14-15 from what I call the A narrative, where they fit quite well. It is precisely because he assigns these verses to the D layer that the D layer as he defines it cannot function as an indepen- dent story and must be described, implausibly, as an elaborate gloss.</page><page sequence="8">608 Journal of Biblical Literature but this cannot be an empowerment for leadership..., since neither in this passage nor in the larger narrative do we hear anything of their sharing Moses' office."'14 But this baffling aspect of the elders narrative results only from Jobling's odd division. Once we recognize that Moses' statement in w. 11-15 is a unified whole stemming from a single source, and that a second source begins at v. 16, this baffling aspect of the elders story disappears. H. Seebass divides the text into four sources: an old J story about the sev- enty elders; a story about the plague of the quail; a revolt story; and a postexilic addition on the prophecy of Eldad and Medad.15 In addition, the description of manna may come from a separate document. It is difficult to argue against See- bass's atomizing division, precisely because it is impossible to argue for it. Are w. 16aa and 16b from one source, and v. 16ap from another, as he argues? Do w. 18aa on the one hand and 18a--b on the other stem from different docu- ments? Perhaps, but there is no evidence-of plot, language, or style-that could prove such divisions. It is of course possible, as Seebass would have us believe, that an incomplete story of the people's craving for food and a narrative snippet in which God responds to a craving by sending quail were joined by a redactor; but given that the request and its ironic fulfillment work together as a coherent story here as well as in Psalms 78 and 106, and given further that they in no way contradict each other, one wonders why a critic would suggest tearing them asunder.16 The advantage of the older analysis I have embraced rests in its elegance and simplicity. It yields two sources and two complete stories. Seebass's division of the text into a hodgepodge of four or five fragments, none of which functions independently, is admittedly a possible one that cannot be disproved. But against an analysis that finds coherence, it seems unlikely. The source-critical division I adopt renders many oddities in the text understandable, since the narrative disjunctions in Num 11:4-35 are present only in the redacted text; each of the two strands we identify is free of the sudden shifts of topic and non sequiturs found in the text as a whole (and in the sources as identified by Noth 14 David Jobling, The Sense of Biblical Narrative: Three Structural Analyses in the Old Testa- ment (JSOTSup 7; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1978) 31. Jobling attempts in a very thor- ough and original fashion to read Numbers 11-12 as a unity, while acknowledging the composite nature of the chapter. However, he does not attempt to utilize the source-critical divisions to any great degree; he approaches vv. 11-12 as a whole, not as a redacted text, and thus our projects dif- fer. For convincing critiques of Jobling's stimulating essay, see Blum, Komposition, 79 n. 151; and Fisch, "Eldad," 47. Like Jobling, Fisch provides a suggestive attempt to read the story as a unity defined by a set of binary oppositions (some of which, as so often in structuralist analyses, are gen- erated more by the search for polarities than by the text itself); he too suspends consideration of the diachronic dimension implied by his analysis. 1. H. Seebass, "Num. XI, XII und die Hypothese des Yahwisten," VT 28 (1978) 214-23, esp. 219-20. 16 See also Schart's critique of Seebass in Mose und Israel, 163 n. 48.</page><page sequence="9">Sommer: The Redaction of Numbers 11 609 and Seebass). What remains is the question, Why has a text centering on com- plaints regarding food and leadership been combined with a text concerned with prophecy? In order to understand why these stories were brought together, and how their union affects the reader, it will be helpful to look at the images each presents of the character Moses. II. The Characterization of Moses The B story, "Moses, the elders, and prophecy," portrays Moses in an entirely positive manner. This becomes clear as we note how the story works with the texts immediately before and after it, both of which also contain ele- ments typical of E.17 In 11:1-3, which we might term, "Moses, the people, and prophecy," the people complained (we are not told about what), God scorched them with a fire, and the people cried to Moses. Moses, filling a classical prophetic role, interceded for the people, and God acquiesced to Moses' prayer by stopping the fire. In chap. 12, which we might call, "Moses, his sib- lings, and prophecy," Aaron and Miriam complain against Moses, emphasizing their own status as prophets. God appears to the three siblings to tell them that Moses is set apart from other prophets. God then inflicts Miriam with leprosy. After Moses prays on her behalf, she is healed. These three texts in chaps. 11-12 form a unit concerned with Moses' rela- tion to the prophetic office, its roles, and its subsequent history. The first part of this unit, 11:1-3, underscores the patience of Moses, his concern for the unwor- thy nation, and his effectiveness as a prophetic intercessor. Moses is quick to respond to his people's cry by praying for them, and God is quick to respond to Moses' prayer by forgiving the people. The third story, which appears in chap. 12, extols Moses as well. God himself sets Moses apart by announcing that from prophet to prophet there is none like this prophet (12:6-9). As in the first part of this unit, God immediately answers a prayer that comes from Moses' lips. The story also stresses Moses' beneficence: although Miriam and Aaron impugn his authority, Moses promptly heeds Aaron's plea that he pray for Miriam. The text further depicts his humility: he did not himself take any action to penalize or even respond to the talk against him. After all, the text reminds us in 12:3, "The man, Moses, was very humble (r'V)-more so than any other person on the face of the earth." The second part of this triad, our story of "Moses, the elders, and prophecy," emphasizes these same characteristics. In 11:17 God takes some of 17 See, e.g., Gray, Numbers, 98-100, 120-23. Noth assigns the original story on which chap. 12 is based to J, but he does so merely on the basis of the presence there of the tetragrammaton-a criterion that is meaningless after Exodus 3 (History of Pentateuchal Traditions, 127 n. 359). In any event, Noth agrees that the elders story and the core of Numbers 12 are closely connected (pp. 128-29). In his Numbers commentary (p. 93), he describes chap. 12 as a secondary addition to J.</page><page sequence="10">610 Journal of Biblical Literature Moses' spirit (rnn) and gives it to the seventy elders, but this does not reduce Moses' prophetic power-Moses simply has m7 to spare. Rabbinic commenta- tors compare the transfer of Moses' nr to the use of one candle in lighting another (the first candle does not lose any of its flame); and they compare it to the act of teaching (the teacher's knowledge is not diminished as a result of the pupil's gain).'s At the same time, v. 17 takes pains to make clear that the first candle is brighter than the other seventy, that this teacher is greater than all the pupils combined. God accords honor to Moses there and stresses his superior- ity to the elders by speaking directly to him but not to them: "I shall descend and speak with you, and I shall take some of the spirit that is upon you and put it on them."19 Further, this story shows Moses to be a humble prophet, unaffected by his unique status and happy to share his spirit with others. In v. 29, Joshua objects to the prophesying of Eldad and Medad in the camp, whereupon Moses responds, "Are you jealous on my behalf? Would that all YHWH's nation were prophets, indeed that YHWH would put his spirit on them!" Commentators ancient, medieval, and modem celebrate Moses' selflessness here as well as his devotion to his people. According to Midr Tehillim 14.6, Moses' statement expresses his hope for the whole nation's salvation (i.e., his comment represents a hope for a boon for Israel), which will be fulfilled in the world to come.20 Nachmanides understands Moses' exclamation in 11:29 as an example of his humility (rir:r~:n), implicitly linking this verse with 12:3.21 Verse 29 is explicitly linked with Num 12:3 as an example of Moses' great humility (m7n ) in Midr. Hag. to Numbers 12:3 and in Midr Leqah Toy to 11:29.22 Similarly, John Calvin maintains that v. 29 evinces "the gentleness and humility of Moses, whom no ambition, nor consideration of his personal dignity, prevents from willingly admitting the very lowliest into companionship with himself."23 By stressing his humility, these texts read this verse along with the last story of the triad found in 18 See, e.g., Sifre Bemidbar ?93, on v. 17 (Siphre D'Be Rab [ed. H. S. Horovitz; Leipzig: Gus- tav Fock, 1917] 94), and Rashi on v. 17. Modern commentators similarly stress that the transfer of Moses' spirit to the elders did not dilute Moses' own prophetic ability. See Gray, Numbers, 111; Licht, Numbers, 2.18; so also Alan Cooper and Bernard Goldstein, "At the Entrance to the Tent: More Cultic Resonances in Biblical Narrative," JBL 116 (1997) 204-5. 19 This point is made by Milgrom, Numbers, 87; Rashi ad loc.; and Sifre ad loc. (ed. Horovitz, 94). Cf. Exod 19:19, which makes the same point. 20 In the edition edited by Salomon Buber (Vilna: Romm, 1891) 114; in Midr. Soher Tob (repr., Jerusalem, 1968) 38. 21 See his comment on 11:28 (.'. . ,7=U ? In ' CU;i I7nl7l:.n ml). Similar comments appear in Pirqe R. El. and Zohar (see the citations in M. M. Kasher, Torah Shelemah [in Hebrew; 48 vols.; Jerusalem: Beit Torah Shelemah, 1927-95] 38.204-7). 22 See Midr. Hag. (ed. S. Fisch; 2 vols.; London: Chinnuch, 1957) 1.281.; Midr. Leqah Tov (ed.

Modern commentators follow a like path. Gray is typical when he says, "Moses has more at heart the good of the community as a whole than his own personal honour or continued pre-eminence . .. this fine trait in Moses' character as conceived in early Israel stands out clearly." Similar trib- utes are found in the commentaries of Sturdy, Milgrom (who specifically con- nects this verse with the assertion of Moses' humility in 12:3), and Levine, as well as in studies by a political scientist (Aaron Wildavsky) and a theologian (Abraham Joshua Heschel).24 The three stories concerning Moses' prophetic status in Numbers 11-12, then, portray Moses with great enthusiasm. They depict him as good-hearted to the complaining people he leads and even to those who rival him, endowed with prophetic spirit greater than that of any other human, unusually adept in all aspects of prophetic office, and humble in spite of it all. Further, he is dis- posed to share his spirit with others, though God ordains that he remain unique.25 The Moses of our A story, "Moses, the people, and plague," differs consid- erably. When the people complain that they want meat, he doesn't pray for them; instead, he erupts into a long and angry outburst, asking God why he has placed such a horrid burden on his servant (vv. 11-15). Am I responsible for this people? Moses demands. Should I have to care for it as if I were its nursing father?26 Moses exclaims that if God treats him thus, he would rather be killed 24 Gray, Numbers, 115; Sturdy, Numbers, 86; Milgrom, Numbers, 91; Baruch Levine, Num- bers 1-20 (AB 4A; New York: Doubleday, 1993) 63-64, 341. See also Aaron Wildavsky, The Nurs- ing Father: Moses as Political Leader (University, AL: University of Alabama Press, 1984) 73, 143, 150-51, 167, 180; A. J. Heschel, God in Search of Man (New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1955) 227-28. On the positive evaluation of Moses in Numbers 11-12 generally, see also Blum, Komposi- tion, 79-80 and 194-96. 25 Of course, this positive characterization of Moses is not the only function of the original B story. Just as one can analyze this story as part of the pro-Mosaic triad in Numbers 11-12 (to which B belonged prior to its combination with A), so too B may have had a context prior to its redaction into this pro-Mosaic triad. B is clearly related to several other texts that address the issue of Moses' status in relation to that of the elders, such as Exodus 18; 33:7-11; and 24:1-2, 9-11. (On this issue, see Levine, Numbers, 338-43.) One may argue, for example, that our B text and Exod 24:1-2, 9-11 are parallel accounts from a collection of related narratives, each of which presents theories regard- ing how the seventy elders acquired their status as '~9 . Similarly, one may suggest that Exodus 18 and B together recount the development of the institution of the elders. What emerges from these considerations is that B has many different Sitze im Text and hence many different functions: (1) B can be viewed as part of an old grouping of traditions or of an older narrative document (sometimes called E). In this setting it is especially concerned with issues of leadership and with the etiology of the elders and prophecy (as Levine points out). (2) It can be viewed as part of the pro-Mosaic triad in an older version of Numbers 11-12 that does not yet con- tain the A story. Here it is especially concerned with extolling Moses (as I point out above). (3) It can be viewed as part of the redacted text of Numbers 11-12 found in the current Torah. Its func- tion in this third-level setting is the concern of this article. 26 On the curious phrasing, see Tikva Frymer-Kensky, In the Wake of the Goddesses (New</page><page sequence="12">612 Journal of Biblical Literature (11:15).27 This diatribe contrasts starkly with his activities in our B narrative. While B's Moses speaks rarely, preferring to say little and do much, A's rambles in his verbose complaint. He is not humble but petulant, not beneficent but bit- ter. Instead of concern for his people, he displays contempt for them and for his unwanted role as their parent. (The characterization of the prophet here recalls Exod 4:1-16, in which Moses attempted to shirk the command that he lead the people out of Egypt; significantly, that passage, like our A text, is attributed to J. In the E version of that story, Moses' one remark, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and free the Israelites from Egypt?" [Exod 3:11], seems more humble than obstinate; but in J, Moses continues to raise objections to serving when God's intent is already manifestly clear.) The A story stresses Moses' self- centeredness by repeating emphatic first-person pronouns: 'nf?"'i '1 N (v. 12); 'r~ '~:~3 1 rH- (v. 14). Moses' declaration (v. 15), "Let me not experience my misfortune" ('n'1),28 also focuses attention on his self-pity.29 Moses' indigna- York: Macmillan, 1992) 267 n. 15. Cooper and Goldstein ("At the Entrance," 204 n. 14) point out the important contrast between Moses' words and "the proud boast of Kilamuwa and Azitiwada that they are like father and mother to their people: KAI 24.10; 26.A.i.3." Moses' comment here is the antithesis of the attitude expected of a Northwest Semitic leader. 27 One might compare this statement with Exod 32:32. There, too, Moses asks to die, but he expresses a death wish to deter God from destroying Israel. In Num 11:15, on the other hand, he wants to die not because he loves the people but because he is sick and tired of them. (Significantly, Exod 32:32, like our B narrative and the other stories of the pro-Mosaic triad in Numbers 11-12, is normally attributed to E; see Carpenter and Harford, Hexateuch, 132; Driver, ILOT, 38). Similarly, Milgrom contrasts Moses' outburst in Num 11:11 ('nMS'-tt ,n~1 7jI T2 7 n1m7 ~ 'M7n n 7no  7'n IVn) with Moses' words in Exod 5:22 ('3nnx MTr 77r nmn aD~ uT 7 7 ' ?7-r nwl): "Moses' selfless concern with his people has apparently evaporated" (Numbers, 85). It is revealing that pre- cisely the phrasing Moses had used earlier to complain on behalf of the people now appears as Moses complains on his own behalf; the comparison underscores Moses' concern with himself in Num 11:11. 28 According to midrashic texts and the Masorah Magna the wording n17: in the MT is a tiqqan softrim, apparently for a text that originally read 7nS7 ("your evil deed") or n17S2 ("their misfortune"). See Sifre ?84 (ed. Horovitz, 82); Mek. Dgifrd ?6 (Mechilta D'Rabbi Ismael Cum Variis Lectionibus et Adnotationibus [ed. H. Horovitz and C. Rabin; Jerusalem: Wahrman, 1970 (1931)] 135); and Christian Ginsburg, Introduction to the Massoretico-Critical Edition (New York: Ktav, 1966 [1896]) 353. However, the suggestion that a tiqqan sOftrim is found here is unlikely. It receives no support in the versions. Granted, Tg. Neof and Frg. Tg. reflect a reading ofnul7 (i.e., "the people's suffering"). This translation is understandable as a midrashic interpretation (see n. 47 below), but it most likely does not reflect the original behind a tiqqan s6f rim, since tiqqane^ sOft@im generally ascribe inappropriate action or anthropomorphism directly to God. Rashi on Job 32:2 (as cited in A. Berliner, Raschi: Der Kommentar des Salomo B. Isak iiber den Pentateuch [2d ed.; Frankfurt: Kaufmann, 1905] 300; contra Rashi on our verse) suggests that the text originally read Inra (i.e., "the evil You will do"), which at least allows for an understandable case of tiqqan sOfrtm. However, Milgrom (Numbers, 86) points out that if the text allows n7D.. (v. 11) to remain, then ,.Dzp would not be so difficult, and hence n.3, must be original. "In fact," he notes, "it is essential, for it makes the entire passage an outpouring of Moses' self-pity, climaxed by this remark: Since God is the author of his wretchedness, He might as well finish off the job-and take his life." 29 The contrast of A with the pro-Mosaic triad Num 11:1-13 and Numbers 12 becomes even</page><page sequence="13">Sommer: The Redaction of Numbers 11 613 tion appears all the more surprising when we notice that this story, unlike other complaint or murmuring texts in the Pentateuch, does not depict a rebellion against Moses. Rather than addressing their complaint to him, the people wept in private, and they did so not as a unified (and hence threatening) group but "each family at the entrance to its own tent" (v. 10). Moses' tirade in vv. 11-15 is not motivated by worry over his own safety or frustration regarding a rebellion, and is less excusable than an accusation against the people would have been in, say, Exodus 14, Numbers 16, or Numbers 20.30 The last sections of this story also prove embarrassing to Moses. He doubts that God can supply enough meat for the nation (v. 22). God's response further lowers Moses in the reader's sight. In anger or in jest, God mocks Moses' lack of trust that he will find meat for six hundred thousand (v. 23). Then God brings quail in an action that turns out to be spitefully ironic: the people are stricken by plague just as they begin to enjoy the meat for which they yearned (v. 33). Because the plague follows Moses' complaint, the reader senses that God sent it not only to punish the people but to mollify Moses.31 This reading is strength- ened by the phrasing of God's retort in v. 23: "Now you will see whether My word is fulfilled for you (r-ip'n) or not!" The odd accusative in the word r]ip'n demonstrates that God afflicts the nation at least in part in order to demon- strate his might to his prophet.32 Alternative readings of vv. 21-23 are possible, but they too force the reader to see Moses as an anti-prophet. Moses' statement may express his frus- tration with the nation rather than his doubt regarding God. Thus, v. 22 may not mean, "I doubt you can bring enough meat, God," but, "The people will never be satisfied. You could bring all the meat in the world and it won't seem like enough for them."33 This reading sheds a different light on God's response: more conspicuous when we consider the structure shared by Num 11:1-13 and Numbers 12 (along with Num 21:5-9, another E text). Olivier Artus points out that these stories describing the peo- ple's grievances include six fixed elements; see his Etudes sur le livre des Nombres: Rdcit, Histoire et Loi en Nb 13,1-20,13 (OBO 157; G6ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1997) 37-38. The A nar- rative also deals with the people's grievance, but of the elements identified by Artus, those that con- tribute to Moses' stature (e.g., intercession) are notably absent or overturned in our A narrative. Elements that do not enhance Moses' stature (e.g., topographic conclusion) are nevertheless pres- ent. 30 So George Coats, Rebellion in the Wilderness: The Murmuring Motif in the Wilderness Traditions of the Old Testament (Nashville: Abingdon, 1968) 101; Schart, Mose und Israel, 160. On the other hand, Moses claims in 11:13 that the people did complain to him directly, but this may be an exaggeration on his part. 31 Milgrom comments, "From God's response (v. 23) to Moses' faltering faith (vv. 21-22), it would almost seem that the quail are brought to Israel in order to prove God's power to Moses!" (Numbers, 88). Cf. Jobling, Sense of Biblical Narrative, 30. 32 The emphasis on Moses' desire to see a miracle is even stronger in the Samaritan version, which reads nfn nn rather than MT's M-n MyD (see Licht, Numbers, ad loc.). 33 See Levine, Numbers, 325, for this sense of nb ?en.</page><page sequence="14">614 Journal of Biblical Literature v. 23 means not, "Yes, I can gather any amount of meat, Moses," but rather, "Oh, I can satisfy them. They want meat? I'll give them so much meat, they'll wish they never asked for it." According to this reading, Moses does exactly the opposite of what a prophetic intercessor should do: he criticizes Israel before God and hence encourages God to punish them. (The motif of Moses as informer or snitch is aggravated when we recall that the people did not speak directly to Moses and that v. 10, as George Coats points out, "gives the impres- sion that Moses just happened to overhear the statement of their complaint."'3 Thus Moses' grievance appears to bring the nation's discontent to the attention of a God who might otherwise have ignored it.) A third possibility, equally inju- rious to Moses' reputation as a leader, is suggested by Marc Brettler: "Moses' complaint could be taken as a wish that the people would be less populous, thus less burdensome. His complaint allows an alternative solution rather than a new administrative system: a drastic reduction of population so that they can be handled more easily."35 The wording of v. 22 is deceptively, and I think deliber- ately, vague. The verse encourages not one but three readings, all of which redound to Moses' disfavor. Each possibility may influence the reader, and the ambiguity fosters a stronger denunciation of Moses than a unequivocal text would have done.36 III. The Effects of Redaction in Numbers 11 and Interpretive Tradition Examination of the two documents found in Num 11:4-34 shows that they present opposing images of Moses.37 We may well ask, then: For what reasons 34 Coats, Rebellion, 101. 35 Marc Brettler, The Creation of History in Ancient Israel (London: Routledge, 1995) 69. 36 Cf. Meir Sternberg's insight regarding the role of ambiguity in 2 Samuel 11, where mutu- ally exclusive systems of gap filling work together to lower the reader's estimation of David (The Poetics of Biblical Narrative [Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985] 186-229). Schart proposes a completely different understanding of Moses' dialogue with God (Mose und Israel, 161-65, 215), according to which Moses in v. 10 is displeased not with the people but with God's anger at them. His speech in vv. 11-15, according to Schart, is a defense of the people, whose desires Moses himself champions. But Moses' speech lacks any clear statement of sympathy with the people, whom he characterizes, on the contrary, as a burden. Schart suggests (p. 165) that Moses' disavowal of the role of wet nurse in v. 12 implies that God is the real mother of the people and hence presents an implicit prophetic intercession. This reading is ingenious, but the alleged intercession is so subtle in comparison with genuine cases of Mosaic prayer on the nation's behalf that we must conclude that it is nonexistent. 37 On the differing portrayals of Moses in J and E generally, see Gerhard von Rad, Old Testa- ment Theology (2 vols.; Edinburgh: Oliver &amp; Boyd, 1965) 1.291-94. Von Rad notes that in J, Moses' role is more limited than it is in E. He does not point out the specifically negative portrayal of Moses that emerges from Numbers 11 and some other J texts. Regarding this particular issue, at least, Harold Bloom has a legitimate insight: "P is wary of Moses, E exalts him, while J handles the deliverer of the people with the affectionate irony that is distinctive of this author" (The Book of J</page><page sequence="15">Sommer: The Redaction of Numbers 11 615 did a redactor bring together two texts that not only tell completely unrelated stories but reflect such different viewpoints?38 The oddity of this redaction can be gauged from two comments found in Jacob Milgrom's recent commentary on Numbers. Discussing v. 29, Milgrom states: "Moses' selflessness reaches its apogee in this passage and thereby merits the accolade awarded him: 'Now Moses was a very humble man, more so than any other man on earth' (12:3)." A few verses earlier, Milgrom described Moses as wholly lacking the "selfless con- cern for his people" he had displayed earlier in his life. Milgrom thus describes Moses as reaching the apogee of selflessness and lacking it altogether in this chapter.39 Redaction yields a unit whose elements are at odds with one another.40 [New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1990] 241; see further pp. 242-50). Scholars have rarely attended to negative attitudes toward Moses in the Pentateuch (an exception is Trent Butler, who does not deal with J texts primarily ["An Anti-Moses Tradition," JSOT 12 (1979) 8-15]). Rather, most schol- ars (following in the footsteps of E) describe the characterization of Moses as a type of heroic saga or as hagiography (e.g., George Coats, Moses: Heroic Man, Man of God [JSOTSup 57; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1988), if they do not compose works that themselves display affinities with these genres (e.g., Elias Auerbach, Moses [Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1975]). The caustic attitudes toward Moses warrant further study. They may reflect biblical literature's skepti- cism toward (but not repudiation of) leadership, a skepticism seen most prominently in the stories about David in the books of Samuel. On the connection between Moses and David, see Bloom, who regards Moses as "an uncanny step on the way to David" (p. 242) even though "in personality and character he could scarcely be further from the David of 2 Samuel" (p. 244). 38 I deliberately phrase the question in terms of the redactor's intentions. The redactor who combined these disparate texts was, I presume, neither suffering from aphasia nor blindly pasting together random scraps in a darkened room. I do not see any cause to resist the assertion that the redactor combined texts in a surprising way for some reasons, and that we can attempt to recon- struct these reasons by evaluating the results he or she produced. Incidentally, the extent to which synchronically oriented literary critics repudiate interest in authorial intentionality has been exag- gerated; see John Barton, Reading the Old Testament: Method in Biblical Study (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1984) 149-51. Further, Barton argues persuasively that even for synchronically ori- ented readers, a wholesale retreat from consideration of intent is neither as plausible nor as desir- able as many structuralists and post-structuralists propose (see pp. 167-70 and 188-87). What theorists since the New Criticism rightly object to is the attempt to use biographical or historical evidence to determine the meanings of a text; but divining the intent of an author by analyzing the text itself is hardly illegitimate for a literary reader. 39 Milgrom, Numbers, 91, 85 respectively. Levine also pays attention to the question, Why are the themes of governance and complaints regarding food found together? (Numbers, 327-28, 337). His answer is not convincing (governance is in fact not the issue in the elders' story at all, since they were judges before the event recorded in it), but he identifies the question that needs to be raised. 40 Martin Buber is one of few commentators to acknowledge the tension: "The story of the descent of the Spirit upon the Elders lies before us in a singular fusion with the story of the gift of the quails. It has not merely been grafted on to this tale, which was clearly originally connected with that of the manna, but has actually grown into union with it; in such a way, however, that the sepa- rate branchings of both can still be distinguished" (Moses: The Revelation and the Covenant [New York: Schocken, 1958] 163).</page><page sequence="16">616 Journal of Biblical Literature As a result, it becomes possible-indeed necessary-to read one story in light of the other. Before readers of the redacted text arrive at God's command that seventy elders gather (in B, vv. 16-17), they already know (from A) that Moses and God are incensed. Consequently, they are likely to view the com- mand to bring elders together as somehow denoting the onset of punishment. The way that the two texts have been combined enhances this reading of vv. 16-17, because the command there to assemble elders appears in tandem with God's description (in A, vv. 19-20) of the plague he intends to send. Those who read the B narrative by itself, on the other hand, would not have regarded the gathering of elders as having any ominous significance. For them, vv. 16-17 simply present God's decision to spread His spirit among a nation privileged to contain many prophets and to be led by a man who has spirit to spare. Moses' exclamation in v. 29b ("Would that all YHWH's nation were prophets .. .") is similarly turned on its head once that B verse follows As por- trayal of Moses. Moses wants to share his unique status in the redacted story not because he is a democrat at heart but because he hates the people and would rather die than continue to bear responsibility for them. Against this background, his statement carries a new meaning. The redacted story's Moses does not say, "I wish that all the people could enjoy the spiritual gifts I enjoy," but instead, "I wish all of these revolting people had to suffer this burden."41 This is hardly the Moses upon whom commentators on v. 29 heaped accolades! The elders' acquisition of Moses' spirit also takes on new meaning in the redacted story. Whereas for B that event betokens the strength of Moses' prophetic ability, the reader of the redacted text can understand it quite differ- ently. Because Moses disbelieved God in vv. 21-22 and because he failed to ful- fill his prophetic role as intercessor, God punishes Moses by taking away some of his spirit, which he then gives to the elders. The reader of the redacted story may not be inclined to compare the transfer of spirit to the transfer of fire from one candle to another (in which the fire from the first candle remains undimin- ished). That reader may view the spirit's movement as a zero-sum transaction: if the elders gained, then Moses lost. Indeed, Milgrom argues for precisely this reading: 41 Of the commentators I have read, only Buber begins to recognize that Moses, in the con- text of the chapter as a whole, sees prophecy as less than a blessing: "The narrator does not wish this superiority [of Moses over the elders] to be understood as something desired by Moses himself, who was 'very humble,' but as the fate with which he has been charged by God and which oppresses him.... The narrator extracts these words [Moses' exclamation in v. 29] with great wisdom. For when the whole people have become nebiim, in direct contact with God, it would no longer be nec- essary for somebody to be charged by God with the function of bearing them on his bosom like an infant" (Moses, 166-67). My position differs from Buber's for two reasons. First, Buber reads only the unified texts and is not interested in reading the sources individually prior to seeing how they work together. Second (and resulting from the first and also from his hesitancy to see a petulant and shirking Moses), he does not see the story as characterizing Moses as negatively as I do.</page><page sequence="17">Sommer: The Redaction of Numbers 11 617 It is Moses' failure to "stand in the breach" (cf. Ezek. 22:30; Ps. 106:23) that explains why the story of the elders is interwoven with the story of the quail: to provide punishment for Moses! ... Evidently, the fusion of these two sto- ries is an attempt to demonstrate that Moses was punished by the diminution of his spiritual powers (the story of the elders) for failing to intercede on Israel's behalf when it craved meat (the story of the quail) and for failing to believe that God could provide it.42 A similar reading is found in Calvin's commentary.43 We find, then, a debate among interpreters regarding the word 'f nm in v. 16. According to the midrashim quoted above (Midr. Tehillim, Leqah Tov), the word conveys exten- sion but not diminution of Moses' power. For Calvin and Milgrom, on the other hand, it betokens a loss of prophetic spirit (indeed, Calvin understands 'n~fl' here as "separate"). Both opinions are right: in the original B story, Moses can give spirit away without losing it; but when we read B in light of A in our redacted text, we sense that Moses is punished through the weakening of his prophetic gift. The insertion of B verses into the larger A story has changed the meaning of the B verses; redaction has accomplished a sort of inner-biblical exegesis. Before coming to B, the audience has already read much of A's depiction of Moses, in which the angry prophet deserves punishment (vv. 11-15 and 18-24a). Consequently, verses from B that extol Moses (vv. 24b-30) take on a negative significance. A subverts B. Yet A does not overpower B. To read B verses in the context of A, one must read them against their own grain. The first part of Moses' statement in v. 29, "Are you jealous on my behalf?" does not yield as easily to an adverse interpre- tation as the second: Moses does renounce jealousy here. The notion that Moses has spirit to spare may occur even to the reader of the redacted text. The redaction, then, forces the reader to see doubly: the reader may focus on the B verses, with their positive portrayal, or the reader may integrate those verses into the negative view found in A. In either case, something will seem amiss, so that the reader can, or must, contemplate the other possibility. Even if a reader concentrates on B's Moses, A's Moses lingers, so that the reader is compelled to reevaluate. On the other hand, B's Moses will seep through As. And yet another possibility exists: one can read Num 11:4-35 as part of chaps. 11-12 as a whole. In that case one looks at A material in the context of the triad of stories that praise Moses as prophet par excellence. To do so one must assimilate many A verses to B verses, ignoring their narrow context in favor of a broader one. We are left with several ways to evaluate Moses as he appears in this redacted story. Crucial verses exhibit a bivalence of meaning: how we interpret them depends on the context in which we choose to read them. 42 Milgrom, Numbers, 377. 43 Calvin, Commentaries, 4.24-25.</page><page sequence="18">618 Journal of Biblical Literature A similar bivalence affects the word rn~, which appears with different meanings and values in the A and B texts. In A, God uses a nn (in the sense of wind) to bring the quails for which the people had yearned (v. 31). The rn~, which seemed to be a harbinger of good, turns out to cause disaster. This word seems at first to betoken God's mercy in A but is in fact a figure of anger and irony; consequently, it signifies the people's distance from God. In B, God gives some of Moses' mn to the elders; when it descends on them, they break into prophesying. Here nn represents the working of a divine force on certain indi- viduals. It gives them status as prophets and enhances their political role as judges.44 Hence it expresses God's closeness to the people. In the redacted ver- sion, however, Moses views that divine force as a torment rather than as a bless- ing. How one perceives 1n7 depends on which context the reader privileges.45 The tension between A and B lives on in the interpretive traditions this chapter engenders. Some commentators read A in light of the pro-Mosaic triad that includes B, while others attempt to assimilate B into A. The former ten- dency is prominent in midrashim on v. 15 ("If this is how you treat me, then kill me now so that I needn't experience my misfortune"). Sifre (followed by Rashi) and Midr. Leqah ToV46 transform A's fed-up Moses into the ideal prophetic intercessor seen in Num 11:1-3 and 12:13. They alter Moses' complaint in v. 15 into a statement he makes on the people's behalf: "Kill me, lest I witness the suffering you will bring on this people, whom I love," rather than "Kill me, since I'm sick of having to lead these people, whom I detest." According to this " Both the prophetic and the political senses of rn as "(divinely originating) spirit" are rele- vant here, though the prophetic predominates, as the repeated root t"23: (vv. 25-27, 29) indicates. (On the political tenor of the phrasing n17l 17r in 11:25-26, see Levine, Numbers, 340-42.) Once B is combined with A, with its emphasis on Moses' role as leader, the political function of rl'n comes into greater prominence. On these two senses of n11", see, e.g., R. Albertz and C. Westermann, '"m," Theologisches Handw6rterbuch zum Alten Testament (ed. E. Jenni and C.

Cf. Milgrom, Numbers, on v. 31. Similarly, one can note that n'l is associated with two opposing modes of leadership throughout the story; see Fisch, "Eldad," 51. Schart points out that the inclu- sion of the material concerning the elders alongside the quail story effects a dialectic between flesh (-bnZ) and spirit (nn) in the final text (Mose und Israel, 165). According to Schart, the former is viv- ified only by the latter, and the people's sin is their lust exclusively for the former. This craving for flesh is put into stark focus as a result of the combination of the quail story with a narrative in which Moses expresses a desire that the whole people receive spirit. 46 Sifre ?91 (ed.

(Greater love hath no prophet.) These readings contextu- alize the A verse within a larger (Elohistic) discourse favorable to Moses. On the other hand, some commentators on v. 15 see God as angry with Moses and Moses as completely frustrated; see Midr. Tehillim 23.3.48 This midrash high- lights the narrower context and thus remains faithful to A's portrayal of Moses. A debate between Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Shimon (found in Tosefta, Sifre, and elsewhere) also reproduces the tension between A and B.49 The two midrashists proffer very different readings of Num 11:22. Akiva understands that in 11:22 Moses doubts that anyone, including God, could bring enough food to satisfy the nation ("Who could supply them sufficiently?" [rn p3e9o 'l], he paraphrases). The only question for Akiva was whether Moses' faithlessness here or at the waters of Meribah in Numbers 20 was worse. (Akiva concludes that Moses was punished in Numbers 20 but not Numbers 11 because in Num 20:10 he expressed his doubt in public.) By stipulating that 11:22 must be read in this straightforward manner (9nr~b:, as Rashi on 11:22 says while paraphras- ing Tosefta),50 Akiva emphasizes the verse's most narrow context in the A narra- tive. He does not attempt to relate this verse to the very different picture of Moses in, say, 11:29 or 12:3. Shimon recoils from this possibility: "God forbid [you should think] that it occurred to that righteous man-of whom scripture says, 'He is trusted/faithful throughout My house' (Num 12:7)-to say, 'God could not satisfy us.'" Rather, according to Shimon, the gist of Moses' remark in 11:22 is that God's plan would ultimately demean God's glory: to feed the people and kill them immedi- 47 This midrash stands behind the reading of Tg.

The debate is also quoted in Rashi on 11:22 and in Midr. Hag. on 11:21 (ed. Fisch, 168-69). A midrash resembling Akiva's inter- pretation is recorded without attribution in Num.

God's reputation would not be well served by this course of action. (Unfortunately for the nation, God is not swayed by this reasoning.) Shimon's exegesis reads against the grain of 11:22 itself, for he understands the verse as containing only the first half of Moses' argument to God, the rest of which was left unsaid and had to be recreated in the midrash; he reads the verse as if it said, "Should sufficient food be found for them, only for you to kill them?" But this eisegesis of an A verse accords well with the B narrative and the larger context of Numbers 11-12, for it asserts that Moses was in fact attempt- ing to save the people. Shimon does not construct the second half of Moses' statement out of thin air. He fashions it from an intertext (viz., the surrounding B material), thus executing a classic midrashic hermeneutic: he adds a narrative element that is required in order to harmonize the verse with a larger context.51 Shimon's supplementation of the verse seems fanciful only in relation to the original A text; in light of the redaction of A into the B triad it seems inevitable. This same tension, and a different attempt at resolution, can be found in Calvin's commentary on Numbers 11. Discussing vv. 10-13 and 22, Calvin emphasizes the excessive nature of Moses' displeasure with the nation, his ungratefulness in response to divine election, and his grossly sinful request for death.52 Here Calvin (like Akiva) faithfully describes A's Moses. Yet by the end of the story, Calvin returns to the characterization found in B and in 12:3, for he deeply admires the humility and magnanimity Moses displays in 11:29.53 This move from A to B is mediated by his reading of vv. 16-24. He adapts the B nar- rative in vv. 16-17 to the A narrative, so that these verses describe a punish- ment meted out against Moses: the prophet's spirit is diminished as some of it is removed from him and bequeathed to the elders. Having been chastised, Moses profited (Calvin explains) by "divine rebuke, for [in v. 24] he actively sets about what he was commanded. Doubt had given him a check, so that he stopped in the middle of his course; whereas he now testifies by the prompti- tude of his obedience that his distrust is overcome."54 In other words, Calvin suggests that Moses repented. This narrative embellishment-for the text nowhere reports Moses' penitence-is "creative" in the classic midrashic sense: Calvin weaves a new element into the story from its context. Since Calvin acknowledges that Moses is clearly selfish in some parts of the story and selfless in others, he senses a gap that must be filled by creating an additional bit of plot. It is significant that Shimon and Calvin use precisely the same interpretive 51 On the use of intertexts in midrash to create new narratives, see Daniel Boyarin, Intertex- tuality and the Meaning of Midrash (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990) 22-56. 52 Calvin, Commentaries, 4.22-23, and see also his remark concerning Moses' doubts in vv. 21-22 (4.31). 53 Ibid., 4.36. 54 Ibid., 4.33.</page><page sequence="21">Sommer: The Redaction of Numbers 11 621 stratagem to come to dissimilar conclusions. Both employ creative contextual historiography,55 in the former's case to emphasize B's Moses while erasing As, and in the latter's to show how A's Moses becomes B's. Classical commentators on Numbers 11 do not simply read verses from one source while ignoring the other-that is, they do not merely dismember the text or feign a conviction that the text is not an integrated whole. Rather, they read B as though it were A or A as though it were B. In so doing they become, unknowingly, students (and captives) of a complex form of inner- biblical exegesis: for they endeavor to show not simply what A means or what B intends but what A means as part of B or vice versa. Thus they help us recog- nize how redaction functions as a form of exegesis and how redaction encour- ages certain reading practices. The redactor ensures that all serious attempts to read this chapter present a debate between A and B. Any interpretation of Numbers 11 must be an argu- ment against (and hence a reminder of) the opposite interpretation, since evi- dence for that opposite is always so close at hand. This debate takes place explicitly in Tosefta as Shimon contests with Akiva. It occurs implicitly as Midr. Tehillim, Calvin, and Sifre add details to the chapter or link it with distant verses in order to respond to countervailing evidence from the chapter itself. The classical commentators, then, illuminate the activity of the redactors pre- cisely because they reenact it. The intricate reworking, misreading, and inser- tion that typify the traditional interpretations of Numbers 11 merely continue the redactor's efforts, for, as we have seen, the redactor's insertion deliberately fosters a cycle of competing misreadings. By presenting the debate between the two sources while also reading one into the other, the classical commenta- tors highlight the composite nature of the text even as they attempt to annul it. Thus, however whimsical the commentators seem, they stand very close to the dynamics of the biblical text.56 I attend to these ancient and medieval readings not to evoke their awareness of the narrative tensions noted by source critics (a trait that needs no demonstration). Rather, I hope to show that the traditional commentators, at least in this case, remain within the world of the text and per- petuate its tropes. They deepen our understanding of the redactor's work, because they help the modem reader to understand how and why the redacted text presents us with a tense unity that constantly falls back on itself. 55 I borrow a term here from Isaac Heinemann (see his Darke Ha-'Aggadah [in Hebrew; 3d ed.; Jerusalem: Magnes, 1970] esp. 21-26) and add to it under the influence of Boyarin, Intertextu- ality. 56 My analysis here arrives at a conclusion found in Jobling's essay: later commentary, which seems so far from the superficial logic of Numbers 11, in fact reflects its deep structures and its most persistent concerns (see Jobling, Sense of Biblical Narrative, 57). A kindred discussion of rab- binic attitudes toward charismatic leadership as aligning with Joshua's attitude in Numbers 11 is found in Fisch, "Eldad," 53-55.</page><page sequence="22">622 Journal of Biblical Literature IV. Conclusion Two readings present themselves in Numbers 11, and interpretive closure is not allowed by the redacted text. This document proves an exemplary case of literary indeterminacy or ambiguity: two mutually exclusive but coherent sys- tems of reading are presented, not only in A and B but in B read as part of A and in A read as part of B. The reader can understand the text as forming either of two systems, but some element of the text will seem out of place. As a result, the reader will be forced either to suppress part of the text or to reevaluate; upon reevaluating, the reader will attend to the other system, only to be dis- turbed by other elements that have now been cast into tension. The text con- founds any attempt to achieve closure in precisely the fashion described by some literary critics interested in ambiguity and indeterminacy. For example, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan describes ambiguity as the "conjunction" of exclusive disjuncts, or-in less technical language-the co-existence of mutually exclusive readings. ... By providing incompatible, yet equally tenable possibilities, ambiguity renders choice impossible and frustrates the reader's expectations of a univocal, definitive meaning.57 Similarly, Geoffrey Hartman maintains that indeterminacy goes beyond a tex- tual puzzle that can be solved through close reading: Indeterminacy does not merely delay the determination of meaning, that is, suspend premature judgment and allow greater thoughtfulness. The delay is not heuristic alone, a device to slow the act of reading till we appreciate ... its complexity. The delay is intrinsic: from a certain point of view, it is thoughtfulness itself, Keats's "negative capability," a labor that aims not to overcome the negative or indeterminate but to stay with it as long as is neces- sary. .... It is the commentary process that matters: the taking away, modifi- cation, elaboration, of previous meanings.58 Now, to discover ambiguity or indeterminacy59 in a literary text is hardly a surprise, especially in the current critical climate.60 What is noteworthy is the 57 Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, "Deconstructive Reflections on Deconstruction: In Reply to Hillis Miller," Poetics Today 2:1b (1980-81) 185-86. See also her book The Concept of Ambigu- ity-The Example of Henry James (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1977) 8-16, 234-35. 58 Hartman, Criticism, 270. 59 The terms are not always used interchangeably, and at times are opposed to each other; see Timothy Bahty, "Ambiguity and Indeterminacy: The Juncture," Comparative Literature 38 (1986) 209-23. In particular, it is important to note that ambiguity as used by Rimmon-Kenan is not a feature of all literary texts, while Hartman's understanding of indeterminacy encompasses a wider scope. But for our purposes, the terms as used by Rimmon-Kenan and Hartman are quite comparable; each suits our text. 60 In much contemporary criticism, indeterminacy becomes the essence of all literary texts, if not all attempts at signification. Viewed so broadly, it ceases to be interesting, since the search for</page><page sequence="23">Sommer: The Redaction of Numbers 11 623 manner of arriving at the conclusion. Within biblical studies, a tendency has emerged in the last several decades to regard literary and historical scholarship as mutually exclusive: the literary critic reads, while the source critic dismem- bers. To revel in the play of meanings or to probe modes of signification is the project of the former method of analysis, a project which the latter does not abet and may even stifle. But in the case of Numbers 11 diachronic analysis aids the critic who wishes to comprehend the unending multiplicity of meaning the text discloses and the interpretive debates that center around it. Many scholars decry the deadening effects of classical source and redaction criticism, which are seen as opposed to the unifying thrust of both premodern religious com- mentary and (post)modern literary approaches. The case of Numbers 11 shows, on the contrary, that these historicist tools, sensitively wielded, enliven our reading.61 Further, they allow us to understand that it is precisely the inter- play of different historical levels in the text that fosters the postbiblical inter- pretive traditions. Diachronic analysis helps establish that the new narratives created in midrashic readings grow out of the text more than they are grafted onto it. The redactor of Numbers 11 has juxtaposed two stories that have nothing to do with each other in terms of plot yet treat similar themes. The text, then, follows a logic of theme rather than of plot. Even this thematic logic does not produce a clear or consistent text, for the tensions involving leadership, proph- ecy, spirit, beneficence, and punishment do not-and given the text's repudia- tion of closure, cannot-find any resolution. Our text, in the end, probably cannot be termed a narrative, if by that we mean setting out a sequence of events related as causes and effects. Rather, Numbers 11 is a collage that pre- sents occurrences that may or may not have any temporal connection, a sort of philosophical dialogue in which the interlocutors are not characters uttering speeches but contexts vying with each other to determine the reading of words and phrases.62 This text refuses to be read in a linear fashion. It demands to be viewed from many angles; certain verses insist on being isolated from what sur- rounds them, integrated into narrower contexts, and harmonized with broader indeterminacy yields reading practices that reduce all texts to the same formula; see Robert Alter, The Pleasures of Reading in an Ideological Age (New York: Norton, 1996 [1989]) 206-38. I use the term in a far more limited sense, to refer to a characteristic of this example of literary art but surely not of all texts. 61 Of course, not all critics wield them sensitively. Noth comments that the story of Eldad and Medad "must be an addition, for it does not fit smoothly with the surrounding context" (Numbers, 90), but begs the question of why a redactor would choose to place this narrative where it is. A sim- ilar problem appears in Coats (see Rebellion, 98). Cf. the critique of Fisch, who moves to the other extreme and ignores the diachronic issues altogether ("Eldad," 45). 62 Cf. Etan Levine, "The Book of Jonah as a Philosophical Book," ZAW 96 (1984) 235-45. Interestingly, Jonah also is an odd sort of narrative: the story simply stops without reaching any con- clusion, so that the book has a beginning and a middle but no end.</page><page sequence="24">624 Journal of Biblical Literature ones. The text invites rereading and rumination, so that a verse can emerge now in one setting, now in another, carrying a particular meaning here and its oppo- site there. Like a set of mirrors, it encourages the reader to notice how ele- ments of the text reflect on each other. Even more, it resembles a kaleidoscope. It is full of divergent views, so that the reader need only turn it and turn it to see that all of them are in it.</page></plain_text>
