<plain_text><page sequence="1">S. Parpóla, Assyrian Prophecies, cxxi, 84 pp., XIII pl. Helsinki, Helsinki University Press, 1997 (= State Archives of Assyria IX). The name Simo Parpóla is rightly famous for the series State Archives of Assyria : a magisterial series of volumes gathering together the remains of Late Assyr- ian archives and literature and presenting them in authoritative editions with brief introductions, notes and glossaries. This volume is devoted to "prophe- cies," in the Biblical Hebrew sense of that word, and the texts all date, it seems, to the reigns of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal, that is to the 7th century B. C. There may have been earlier and later ones, but if so they have not survived. In principle this volume is organized like the others, but with the difference that the Introduction is longer, not because it discusses the texts in the volume (though there is some of this), but it is concerned to propagate a theory that later world religious ideologies go back to Assyrian models as seen in these prophecies. The notes on the texts are also longer than in previous volumes, and again this is due partly to promoting the same theory. It is good to have these texts gathered together in more or less reliable form with translations based on up-to-date knowledge of the Assyrian language in which they are composed, though two qualifications have to be stated. First, collations of Th. Kwasman to appear in a review in the Jewish Quarterly Review give concern that perhaps not every sign on the tablets has been read correctly, and, secondly, here and there the translations reflect the ideas promoted in the Introduc- tion, which this reviewer regrets. Since the texts are now generally well edited and invite study by all interested in Late Assyrian religion, this review will deal exclusively with the Introduction and its revolu- tionary ideas. The author is no stranger to controversy, having published a long article in JNES 52 (1993) 161-208 entitled, "The Assyrian Tree of Life: Tracing the Ori- gins of Jewish Monotheism and Greek Philosophy." There he argued that the sacred tree (called Tree of Life without any justification) in Assyrian art was the basis of the medieval Jewish Sefirotic tree of life, passed down the centuries secretly. This article should be read with the Introduction to the book under review. But in the book the idea of the dependence of Jewish and Christian theology on Assyrian prototypes is ex- tended. The Christian Trinity is declared to be based on an Assyrian model: the state god of Assyria, Aššur, was God the Father, the Assyrian king Esarhaddon was God the Son, and the Assyrian goddess Ishtar was God the Holy Spirit. Thus on "the deeper level" Assyria was monotheistic. If one asks why no explicit evidence for these propositions remains the answer is that these truths were secrets of the initiates, who were bound by oath not to reveal them so they do not appear in plain words anywhere. A massive learning is devoted to furthering these ideas and others related to them, and the author acknowledges that ideally he should have devoted several volumes to their exposition. Similarly to answer all the many assertions would take many volumes, so that is out of the question. So far it does not appear that the ideas are gaining in popularity, and the review article of the book by J. Cooper in JAOS 120 (2000) 430-444 is something from which the present reviewer (and others to whom he has spoken privately) cannot dissent. However, with such a dis- play of learning it would be unscholarly not to deal with some points at least with due care, so we propose to begin with some generalities, then to look at what is pressed as a key group of prophecies, and finally to comment on the use of ancient art in the arguments. (i) Generalities The reviewer has no difficulty what-so-ever with the idea that ancient Mesopotamian ideas passed down through the Hellenistic era to the Greco-Roman world and so to later European and other civilizations. He has in fact proposed that ch. 1 1 of the Hebrew Book of Daniel was modelled on a Babylonian prophetic gen- re,1 and with mathematical astronomy the dependence on the Babylonians by Greek astronomers is well established.2 However, Assyrian political power came to a complete end soon after 612 B. C., and we have no evidence that Assyrian intellectual culture persisted anywhere for any length of time. Babylonian culture, however, died out slowly in the Hellenistic and Parthi- an eras,3 and there was much interest in the Hellenistic ') W. G. Lambert, The Background of Jewish Apocalyptic , Ethel M.

Thus any spread of Mesopotamian ideologies to later civilizations is more likely to have been from Babylonians, rather than from Assyrians. The argument from initiates allegedly sworn to secrecy is not strong, since we have quite a number of tablets clearly written with trade and religious/ideo- logical matter which are expressly declared secrets in the colophons, but which we can read. And the author appears to have an aversion to considering Babylonian evidence. Thus he argues for monotheism in Late Assyrian times, but ignores that in some Late Babylo- nian circles Marduk was considered the god par ex- cellence and the other major members of the pantheon were considered as aspects of Marduk, a concept for which 'monotheism' is a legitimate term.4 A scholar presenting a case for Late Assyrian monotheism could be expected to compare similar Babylonian phenomena since the two countries were geographically close and culturally interdependent, but instead he reads in the later Christian Trinity, though he mentions two of the relevant Babylonian texts in footnote 23 on p. lxxxii. (ii) On key passages in the prophecies The evidence of the Late Assyrian prophecies is pressed into service curtly without consideration of alternative, and, to the reviewer, more plausible expla- nations. On p. xviii: "In oracle 1.4 a deity first speaks as Bel, then as Ištar of Arbela, and finally as Nabû. ... It is as if in this short oracle the deity were repeatedly putting on new masks to suit the changing themes of the discourse ..." Alternatively one could say that the female prophet in one oracle spoke first with a mes- sage of Bel, secondly with a message of Ištar, and finally with a message of Nabû. Was there any prohi- bition of prophets speaking in the name of different deities in succession within one message? It is unusual, but any interpretation of this oracle presumes some- thing unusual. "Most important," we read on p. xix, "in no. 3, a collection of oracles referred to in the text as 'the covenant tablet of Aššur,' the identities of Aššur and Ištar blend in an unexpected and absolutely baf- fling way. The text consists of five interrelated oracles, all by the same prophet, four of which are identified or identifiable as 'words of Ištar of Arbela.' The middle- most oracle (3.3), however, deviates from the pattern. It begins with ... the king's cry for divine help ('Hear me, O Aššur!') ... and ends with a self-identification ... 'I am Aššur, lord of the gods.'" On this basis Aššur and Ištar are presumed to be identified. But there is 4) See the reviewer in J. J. M. Roberts and H. Goedicke, eds., Unity and Diversity (Baltimore and London, 1975) pp. 191-200: "The Historical Development of the Mesopotamian Pantheon: À Study in Sophisticated Polytheism;" and "An- cient Mesopotamian Gods: Superstition, Philosophy and The- ology," RHR 207 (1990) 115-130. fudging of the facts here. There are indeed five oracles on the tablet, and a very damaged colophon at the end probably naming a prophet, but perhaps a scribe. But while the first, second and third, and fourth and fifth are separated by single rulings, a double ruling sepa- rates the third and fourth. The only other case of such a double ruling in this corpus occurs after the first few preserved lines of text no. 1, about which it is com- mented that: "the ruling before oracle 1.1 is a double one, implying that the text before ... did not contain a prophetic oracle. A similar double ruling occurs in no. 3, col. II, where it separates oracle 3.4 from a six-line section of ritual instruction attached to oracle 3.3." (p. lvi). The one certain fact is that a double ruling implies a greater break than a single ruling. The author's argument begins with text 1, where a very damaged three-line section begins with a single ruling and ends with a double ruling, then an oracle begins. The three- line section is too damaged to identify, though it is obviously too short to be an oracle. Thus the author concludes that change of content requires a double ruling: an appended piece of ritual after an oracle (not beginning with a ruling) requires a double ruling be- fore the following oracle can begin. This is a defensi- ble position to take, but it is not the only one. The double ruling in text 1 occurs in too damaged a context to give any real help, and that in text 3 has an obvious alternative explanation. The material preceding the double ruling in text no. 3 is first a damaged narrative statement twice naming Aššur and his temple Ešarra and not alluding to any other deity. The first oracle begins with an address to the Assyrians spoken by a god, not named but presumab- ly Aššur, since it tells the Assyrians of the king's military successes and is immediately followed by a third person statement that Aššur has made the king victorious. This section concludes with a mention of (the god) "Bel-Tarba§i and the gods." In the following second oracle the god Aššur addresses himself to the king throughout, and this oracle is followed by the short ritual section beginning "this covenant tablet of Aššur" ( tup-pi a-de-e an-ni-u šá daš-šur), and by the double ruling. The remaining two oracles on the tablet after the double ruling are explicitly addressed to Esarhaddon by Ištar of Arbela. A very obvious possi- bility is that the tablet embraces two originally sepa- rate collections of oracles and related material: the first oracles of Aššur, the second oracles of Ištar of Arbela, and that the double ruling separates the two groups. The claimed blending of the gods is a fiction: each is restricted to its part of the tablet. The author seeks further proof of the identification of Aššur and Ištar in the mentions of a 'covenant' {ade) in this tablet. In the first, Aššur, section of the tablet a covenant of Aššur is mentioned in the short ritual section just quoted. In the first Ištar oracle she urges,</page><page sequence="3">210 Rezensionen "gods, my fathers and brothers, [enter] the cove[nant ...]" (ina libbi a-d[e-e ...], and later expresses concern that they may forget "this covenant" ( a-de-e an-nu-ti), but then hopes that by ritual drinking: ta-na-sa-ra a-de-e an-nu-ti ša ina muhhi maš- šur-ahu-iddina áš-kun-u-ni you will keep this covenant which I made for Esarhaddon. The author tacitly assumes (pp. xix-xx) that one and the same covenant is meant, so when the Aššur section refers to a covenant of Aššur, and the Ištar section to one made by Ištar, this proves the identity of the two gods. The very translation 'covenant' prejudges the issue. It has a Biblical background in modern English and in the Bible there is never more than one covenant at any given period. Evidence for Late Assyrian religion is scanty, but the passages just quoted clearly allude to two different covenants. The one is the covenant of Aššur as its originator and is to benefit Esarhaddon, it seems. The other was expressly originated by Ištar for Esarhaddon and took in (somewhat unwillingly) Ištar' s divine "fathers and brothers," a phrase which must surely include Aššur. There is no problem in accepting the existence of two covenants, indeed the phrase "this covenant" implies as much. The priesthoods of Aššur and Ištar may well have been competing to secure Esarhaddon's goodwill by promulgating their own cov- enants on his behalf. Thus the textual basis for the grand hypotheses framed is weak. These key passages invite other inter- pretations. And not everyone is willing to assume different levels of understanding in Assyria at the time, by which it is possible to read into the ancient texts what one has picked up from other civilizations. (iii) Illustrations A distinctive characteristic of SAA is the use of pictorial matter "edited by Julian Reade and Simo Parpóla." The custom goes back to more popular books on the ancient Near East, in which plates showing views of ancient sites and antiquities have often been inserted without any close relationship to the text. Many of the pictures in SAA are of this kind, but there is some attempt to correlate pictures to ancient texts by the captions put under the pictures. The quality of the reproductions of photographs is often high, but the scholarly competence revealed does not always match. The Frontispiece of the book shows the impression of a Late Assyrian seal in the British Museum,5 and the caption reads: "Seal of the eunuch Tariba-Issar, depict- 5) Many of the cylinder seals used in this volume have since appeared in Catalogue of the Western Asiatic Seals in the British Museum , Cylinder Seals V, London, 2001, by D. Collon. This is referred to henceforth as BM V. ed as a devotee of Aššur and Ištar." It shows a stand- ing, presumably male but beardless figure in a posture of devotion before a standing god, behind whom stands a goddess. There is an inscription, clearly added after the design was finished as it is squeezed into otherwise vacant spaces. This inscription is nowhere transliter- ated or translated in the volume. It names the owner as Tariba-Issar but does not describe him as a eunuch. That has been deduced from the scene. Also there is nothing about the two deities which justifies the iden- tification with Aššur and Ištar. They could be Adad and Šala, or Nabû and Tašmetum, or other divine couples. The seal engraver probably omitted any iden- tification marks from the gods so that any customer could buy the seal and find his own gods there depict- ed. See BM V 252. A cylinder seal impression is also shown on p. xix (see now BM V 157), but in this case there is no certainty that it is Assyrian, and this is not asserted in the caption. Above a sacred tree there is a winged disc above a lunar crescent, and in the disc there is a big central bust with crown, and to each side a smaller bust without crown. The caption asserts: "A triad of gods on the winged disk," with reference to pages where things "remind" us "of the Holy Trinity of Christiani- ty." But the term 'triad' is misleading. Leaving aside the question of which god is the central one (some- thing not discussed in the book, though the moon-god Sîn is, unusually, likely), seals of this type mostly have the central bust only. A minority have the two smaller side busts also. The obvious conclusion is that the central god, or the only god, is meant to be worship- ped, and the two side busts, when they occur, are intended as divine attendants or worshippers. 'Triad,' when leading on to the Trinity, implies a group of three equals, which is not the case in this and similar seal designs. Fig. 5 on p. xxiii shows a mountain god, again described as "anthropomorphic tree," despite well-in- formed protests to a previous similar assertion (see note 47 on p. lxxxv), on the grounds that mountain gods must wear crowns, something which this one lacks. The evidence for this assertion is not given. P. XXV fig. 7 shows a cylinder seal impression (see now BM V 153), which is captioned "Neo- Assyrian," but the dress with three 'hoops' on the robe from waist to ankles is not Assyrian but occurs in Babylonian art: on the stele of Šamaš-reš-u§ur of Sulju and Mari (WVDOG 4, 1903, Frontispiece), and on two votive cylinder seal designs from Babylon (op. cit. pp. 16-17). Also two similar 'hoops' occur on the dress of two goddesses on a strange cylinder seal with difficult inscription with no Assyrian association at all Ç Miner- va , July/ August 1998, p. 16 fig. 37). There is no reason whatsoever to consider BM V 153 Assyrian. Another cylinder seal design, p. xliii = BM V 381,</page><page sequence="4">Rezensionen 211 is certainly Assyrian and is captioned, "Ninurta/Nabû combatting mythical monsters. Neo-Assyrian cylinder seal with legend reading, 'Let the one who trusts in you not come to shame, O Nabû.' " The inscription was again added after the design was completed, and again the god has no unambiguous distinguishing marks and his identification cannot then be settled from the in- scription. Also only the first line of the inscription is translated, the rest is ignored! The reviewer gave a reading of the whole in NABU 1989/91, and this is repeated in BM V p. 187. On p. xxxviii two drawings show respectively a cow suckling its calf and a sheep doing the same for its lamb. The former is interpreted as showing Mullissu- Ištar, and the latter Ištar. Both identifications are spec- ulative, and the ivory plaque with the cow is not Assyrian art, no doubt plundered from Syria. This is not an exhaustive critique of all the plates and figures in the volume, but one has to regret that the care taken to establish the correct reading of the tablets edited, and to establish the correct meanings of the words on those tablets has not been extended to the correct understanding of the art drawn into the Intro- duction. Indeed, in the development of the theories advanced in the Introduction there are many sweeping assertions which cry out for justification, but one wonders. When one reads of "the role of the Spirit in the immaculate conception of Jesus Christ, as defined in the Apostles' Creed" (p. xxviii), though none of the Creeds even alludes to the immaculate conception, one wonders how sure a guide the author is to Gnosticism, Neo-Platonism or Shakta Tantrism. But one does look forward to more volumes in the tradition of SAA devoted to further enlightenment on the Late Assyrian world. Birmingham. W. G. Lambert.</page></plain_text>
