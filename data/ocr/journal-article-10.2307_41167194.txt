<plain_text><page sequence="1">Decasia: The State of Decay (2002) Directed, produced, and edited by Bill Morrison A Plexifilm DVD release Cindi Rowell Bill Morrison's Decasia is a rich and visceral cinematic experience, one of astonishing beauty and inexhaustible levels of meaning. Originally commissioned by the Europäischer Musikmonat as the visual element of a live event performed in Basel, Switzerland, in November 2001, Deca- sia has since screened worldwide at more than one hundred venues- including as the stage backdrop for popular roots-rock band Wilco on their 2003 tour. This global desire to see what most would label an avant-garde film is a tes- tament to Decasia's accessibility, its bewitching images and powerful meditation on essential themes: the mortality of human beings and the creation and decay of art. Decasia assembles fiction and nonfiction footage from nitrate prints in various stages of decay, culled from major archives and a few pri- vate collections. The work was conceived with Bill Morrison's discovery of two badly deterio- rated yet fascinating sequences from the Fox newsreel collection at the University of South Carolina. One shows a boxer punching away at what is now a column of deteriorated emulsion; another shows spectral nuns presiding over children at a mission school. These ¡mages be- came the foundation of the film and the inspira- tion for Bang on a Can cofounder Michael Gor- don's densely layered, original symphonic score. By all accounts, the world H^H premiere performance, presented in ^^^H association with New York's Ridge ^HH Theater (Morrison's regular collabo- ^^^H rators), was spectacular to behold: ^^^H a fifty-five-piece orchestra was sta- ^^^H tioned on a three-story triangular ^^^H scaffolding that surrounded the au- ^^^H dience; the film and slides (by Lau- ИДД rie Olinder) were projected onto all 5ÎSI three sides of the structure. The SSäfl stand-alone composite 35mm print, ^JH with a soundtrack of the live record- ing, is no less remarkable for the scope and intensity of its ¡mages and sound. This is not the first time Morrison has enlisted archival footage to reflect on the film medium's ephemeral nature and ¡ts presence in the collective unconscious. For his short The Film of Her (1996), he delved into the Library of Congress's treasure trove of early films made from paper prints, coupling them with other found footage to create an experimental narra- tive. Morrison's unnamed protagonist is based on Howard Walls, the copyright clerk credited with rescuing thousands of paper print rolls from incineration. In twelve minutes, what the clerk christens the "whole beginning of cin- ema" rushes past us, as if a cinephile's dream. This speed might brand The Film of Her the for- mal opposite of Decasia1 s fetishistic slow mo- tion, but thematically, it is the perfect comple- ment. Both works ruminate on the creation and fragility of a recording medium. Both res- urrect moving ¡mages "restored to the present time," as the lyrical voiceover in The Film of Her expresses it.1 Following in the footsteps of those who saved the Paper Print Collection, Morrison, in making Decasia, effected both the preserva- tion of nitrate films on the verge of extinction and the re-presentation of this footage. Much like the transfer of paper prints onto celluloid, the selections for Decasia were rephotographed</page><page sequence="2">НИНННННИИННтТ!ш1 144 on an optical printer, frame by frame. Some of the material matching Morrison's criteria (above all, that the deterioration be dazzling to behold) was still available on nitrate negative. However, in cases where the original elements no longer existed or were inaccessible, safety prints- or even U-matic videotape versions- supplied his desired ¡mages of decay. The assemblage of natural breakdown on display is a veritable primer in categories of film damage: water stains that cause loss of emulsion; shifting emulsion re-adhering elsewhere in the frame; crazing (cracked emulsion due to film shrink- age); blistering bubbles from corrosives attack- ing the picture structure; twisting and bobbing images as a result of warped and shrunken film that would not remain flat in the printer gate when rephotographed; solarization (in which light and dark areas are reversed, glow- ing almost radioactively); fading and discol- oration; splotches of mold; fingerprints; and scratches.2 The further Decasia's film selections veer toward nothingness, with emulsion peeling, flaking, and dissolving off the base, the more these frames recall the painterly work of avant- garde artists Stan Brakhage, Len Lye, and Nor- man McLaren, all practitioners of drawing or imprinting directly on the film stock. The silent hand-painted masterpieces of Brakhage come to mind immediately. When the decomposition in Decasia is at its most startlingly pictures- que (a Japanese woman's kimono radiates a marbled-paper pattern; a courtroom scene's drama is heightened as the participants' faces swirl beyond recognition), it recalls the shape- shifting and anthropomorphic patterns of Brak- hage's Night Music (1986), his 1995 trilogy (I Take These Truths, I. . . , and We Hold These), and Coupling (1999). Morrison reveals in na- ture's handiwork analogs to these human-made images. Furthermore, Decasiďs edit in syn- chronization with Michael Gordon's symphony is reminiscent of the integral role music plays in the oeuvres of Lye (e.g., Colour Cry, 1952) and McLaren (e.g., Begone Dull Care, 1949). Also in 2002, another filmmaker released his own aggregate of bits and pieces of ne- glected cinema, albeit ones collected from European archives. Gustav Deutsch's Film 1st 1-6 (1998) and Film 1st 7-12 (2002) are Deca- sia's structural cousins. Both Deutsch and Morri- son achieve their results by rhythmically editing found footage to an experimental soundscape {Film Isťs accompaniment is electronic versus Decasia's live orchestral recording). Although Deutsch too illuminates the beauty of these films, his clinical, scientific approach contrasts with Morrison's poetic route. In Film 1st 7-12, he assembles his selected shots into categories of comedy, magic, conquest, writing, emotion, and memory. Through these associative edits, Deutsch, like Morrison, subverts the films' original meanings to explore the essence and activities of human life and the character of film itself. The dynamic abstractions and edits made by these experimental filmmakers fulfill critic Louis Delluc's charge to make cinema "paint- ing in movement." Indeed, in an interview with Barnaby Welch, Morrison (who holds a BFAfrom Cooper Union) alludes to his work as a painter in describing Decasia: "Each frame is printed at least twice so that the viewer may better examine each frame, and make the subliminal observation that they are watching 24 paintings every second."3 By slowing down the advance of the images, the film gains a sensuous tex- ture, allowing the beauty of the pictorial effects of decomposition to be more fully appreciated. Even more striking is when the painterly decay commingles with the original representational image, often adding a new layer of meaning. There is no shortage of these eye-catching interactions in what Morrison has judiciously curated: a boxer punches an amorphous spar- ring opponent; boys bouncing on an old jalopy warp the car's shape; the rockets of an amuse- ment park ride burst out of the left side of the frame, as if from a fiery liftoff; a dancer's tap- ping feet are enhanced with cartoonish accents; two men trapped in a collapsed mine frightfully eye a pit of water that gurgles and pitches men- acingly; an aggressive maneuver on the part of a man to seize a kiss from an unwilling woman is rendered even more precarious by swirling and splintering emulsion. Although image degradation is the star of Morrison's epic of negative space, the building blocks of Decasia once existed as whole, auton- omous entities. Morrison is a member of the expansive club of artists who co-opt and trans- form quotidian objects or the creative enter- prises of others to produce original works. This</page><page sequence="3">ИИИ1Н145 recycling of "found footage" is widespread in alternative cinema. Nicole Brenez's excellent es- say "A Cartography of Found Footage" (2000) provides a template for appreciating the depth of Decasia. She analyzes Ken Jacobs's Tom Tom the Piper's Son (1969-71), a meticulous, obses- sive contemplation of the 1905 Billy Bitzer film. Brenez argues that Jacobs synthesizes what she identifies as five main uses of found footage: elegiac, critical, structural, materiological, and analytical.4 Decasia accomplishes the same feat. Obviously elegiac in theme, it also offers what Brenez would define as a "critical" frame- work, presenting the material as found (not digitally altered, as many viewers assume). Its structural form is circular (see below), a mate- riological examination of the medium's physi- cal attributes. The film stock becomes the sub- ject. Finally, Morrison analytically spotlights the effects of decay through his associative editing. Although not all of the footage in Decasia originated in the silent era, Morrison is in the esteemed company of others whose work ap- propriates and re-examines silent films, includ- ing Jacobs with Tom Tom the Piper's Son and The Georgetown Loop (1995) and Ernie Gehr with Eureka (1974). Other examples are Peter Tscherkassky's Happy End (1996) and Peter Delpeuťs Lyrical Nitrate (1991). Morrison says his film was "directly inspired by" the latter, a ravishing and loving review of silent film prints found stashed away in an Amsterdam cinema: Obviously, the most exciting moments for me in that film were those where the film showed decay. Particularly the Garden of Eden sequence at the end, which took my breath away when I first saw it projected at [New York's] Film Forum in 1992. Eve gives Adam an apple, and all hell breaks loose on screen. I wanted to make an entire film based on that scene in the tra- dition of symphonic films, Ruttman's Berlin: Symphony of a City and Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi.5 Morrison did indeed create a symphonic film. Composer Michael Gordon, whose entranc- ing score echoes the decay dancing on screen, collaborated throughout the production. His in- struments (strings, winds, percussion, pianos) sound dissonant, even purposefully out of tune. At first, the combination can be overwhelming. The soundtrack drones, clangs, and wails in a lugubrious fashion, as if alarmed at its ac- knowledged fate and raging against the dying of the light. Or perhaps the distressing noises function as a clarion call to preserve these ¡mages before it is truly too late. (This writer's own initial resistance to the score- perhaps subconsciously fearful of the music's meta- physical meaning- slackened on repeat view- ings.) The constant rhythm, the film's pulse keeping time, time, time, seizes hold immedi- ately and doesn't let go until the fade to black. Without any narration, the film uses music as its emotional guide. It transfers anxious and doleful feelings, absolutely appropriate when faced with the concept of death, including our own eventual demise. However, within this melancholy, there beats a Zen-like acceptance of the present and its perpetual bookends, the past and the future. The portal to this realization is through the abstracted ¡mages created organically by time. This brings to mind a Japanese aesthetic phi- losophy called wabi-sabi, which originated in the fourteenth century as a reaction to Chinese formalism. At its core, wabi-sabi instructs that all things are impermanent and imperfect. It en- courages followers to accept reality at its most basic level: nature is in constant flux, and we must appreciate the present. Leonard Koren's summary of the concept seems highly applica- ble to Bill Morrison's Decasia: "Wabi-sabi im- ages force us to contemplate our own mortal- ity, and they evoke an existential loneliness and tender sadness. They also stir a mingled bittersweet comfort, since we know all exis- tence shares the same fate."6 Decasia channels this cycle of life through its primary symbol of the circle, represented both literally and figuratively. Throughout the film, there is an abundance of spiraling objects: revolving dancers, unspooling reels of film, ro- tating amusement park rides, the glowing orb of the setting sun, and three consecutive ap- pearances of spinning wheels. Symmetrical scenes, as if in counterbalance,, materialize over the course of the film. A camel caravan crosses the screen in both horizontal direc- tions; a man climbs up a ladder, while para- chutes plummet to the earth; film strips are dunked into a developing solution, then a woman is baptized in a river. Circular motion is</page><page sequence="4">^^^^^^^^^^^^^Шттт 14б also central to the mechanics of film itself (ro- tating projector reels, cranking camera spools), adding to the reflexive nature of Decasia. Fur- thermore, the film pivots back to its beginning like an Ouroborus, a cinematic snake swallow- ing its own tail. As if on a rewind table, it returns to the Japanese woman and finally to the spin- ning dervish who appears in the opening and closing shots. Decasia also expresses this never-ending cycle in its dual motifs of death (the decompo- sition itself, fire consuming a house, a man in a tomb surrounded by sarcophagi) and birth (a baby born, microscopy of spermatozoa, the Dar- winian allegory of two miners crawling from the water onto land, the development of film in a lab, an abstract shot of fog or smoke that connotes primordial beginnings). On a metaphorical level, Decasia applies this creation-death motif to art, once thought to gain the artist an "eternal summer." Consid- ering Morrison's background as a painter, it comes as no surprise to spy images one can connect to the breadth of art history. The clas- sical period is represented in the ruins of an- cient columns. Loggias, featured in at least three sequences, convey Palladian order and are prominent in Italian Renaissance architecture. In one fleeting scene, two distraught women are comforted outside of an open doorway, through which one can barely perceive, due to fading, a mournful tableau; the Delft painters, especially Jan Vermeer, excelled at opening up pictorial space by arranging their principal composition as seen through a doorway frame. A scene of billowing smoke harks back to the Romantic landscapes of J. M. W. Turner (as well as early cinema audiences' fascination with neb- ulous elements such as smoke and wind cap- tured on film). The wild fluctuation of amor- phous shapes suggests Jackson Pollack's action paintings. Mark Rothko's color-field painting is evoked when, after the camel caravan has de- parted the frame in its second trek across the desert, the shot lingers on the two fields cre- ated by the horizon- the bleached sky and the dark earth. A laughing couple tenderly kisses amid an iridescent, lush background that is so- larized to such extremes it resembles a Warhol canvas from his paint-by-numbers phase. These art historical references that lie beneath the layers suggest that all art works are linked to the same fate as the decaying celluloid. In one telling shot, there is a beret- wearing artist who steps in front of his easel to sketch a lovely model. As the shot progresses, a squiggly blob of decomposition obliterates him and his canvas- both artist and art will be no more, one day. The viewer sometimes strug- gles to see through the top stratum of decay to the original image below, while the decay and the image are engaged in a lopsided battle. What we can express with our imaginations is not guaranteed immortality, because all record- ing media are ephemeral. In his final book, Camera Lucida, Roland Barthes scrutinizes the emotional responses of looking at pictures. There is, he argues, a general cultural interest in a photograph, but when an image strikes one on a deeper level, there is the punctum- something that happens by chance in the photograph and reveals a hid- den meaning. The ultimate punctum is time. Barthes posits that all photographs are infused with an innate melancholy because "there is always a defeat of Time in them: that is dead and that is going to die."7 This connects the subject with the viewer, as they share the same fate. The march of time is the catalyst for decay. In Decasia, Morrison locks the viewer into a state of contemplation about time and its ef- fects. To emphasize this, he allows several sequences (the nuns and their charges, para- chutes raining from the sky, the camel caravan, the ladder climber) to run their entire course, allowing the viewer the full temporal experience. And how have actual viewers responded? Liz Coffey's report on the third Orphan Film Symposium (The Moving Image 3, no. 2 [2003]) related the attendees' response to a screening of Decasia. The prevailing view among these preservation advocates was that the film is pri- marily a celebration of decay. Of course the mis- sion of archivists is to delay this as long as possible. Although one might walk away from Decasia with a new Zen perspective on the cos- mic order, it is unsettling to think of preserva- tion being all in vain. Yet, perhaps the parachute imagery that appears in Decasia*s concluding section becomes a symbol of safety, escape, rescue, and endurance. "To be original," Antonio Gaudi offered, "is to go back to the origins." Bill Morrison has done just that. Lovers of cinema will be happy</page><page sequence="5">НННИНпТПоЯ 147 to learn that Decasia lives not only on DVD but also ¡n the "permanent" collection of the Museum of Modern Art. This is a singular work of art that teaches new ways of seeing and is a thought-provoking, otherworldly trip worth taking. Notes 1.
