<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ignoble Savages and Other European Visions The La Perouse Affair in Samoan History* JOCELYN LINNEKIN The massacre, at Tutuila, of M. de Langle and others, belonging to the expedition under the unfortunate La Perouse, branded the whole group for fifty years as a race of treacherous savages, whose shores ought not to be approached. George Turner1 ON 11 DECEMBER 1787, 12 FRENCHMEN WERE KILLED IN AN ALTERCATION WITH Samoans at Fagas? Bay on the north coast of Tutuila. The statement quoted above, repeated in various forms by author after author, has long represented the conventional wisdom of early Samoan postcontact history.2 Samoa was thought to have had little contact with Westerners until the arrival of the missionary John Williams in 1830, and the 'massacre' at Fagas? is commonly invoked to explain the relatively late involvement of the Samoan islands in external trade. By way of contrast, Hawai'i was drawn into the provisions trade in the 1790s and by 1830 had undergone major political and economic trans formations.8 By 1823 Tahiti was 'the metropolis of the South Pacific islands'.4 Samoa was bypassed, the argument runs, because the Samoans' reputation for treachery kept ships away. Later 19th century writers phrase the historical detenninacy of the La Perouse affair more emphatically than those closer in time to the event, some using Turner's words nearly verbatim.5 But there is no doubt that some seafarers of This paper was written while I was a Research Fellow at Macquarie University in the Schools of Behavioural Sciences and History, Philosophy and Politics.

The goal is not to attack the truth value of Turner's statement, but to place the killings at Fagas? in the wider context of European ideology and expansion in the Pacific. The significance of the Tutuila 'massacre' to Western mariners in the Pacific is not a baseless canard, but neither is it the crucial determining factor in early Samoan history that later accounts have portrayed. The affair at Fagas? and its subsequent reinterpretations illustrate the dialectical relationship between West ern Orientalist visions of Pacific Islanders and contact encounters on particular beaches. As Smith has documented through an analysis of contemporary artistic rep resentations, European views of indigenous Pacific peoples were at a turning point during the era of the La Perouse voyage, 1785-88.9 In the late 18th century the theory of the 'noble savage' was under attack from evangelical Christians and other moralists who found little to admire in images of 'soft primitivism'.10 In contrast to the early explorers, late 18th century missionaries saw only sin and immorality in many native customs: 'to most God-fearing Englishmen, from Dr. Johnson to the itinerant Methodist preachers, it was only too apparent that these so-called innocents of nature were depraved and benighted savages'.11 The attack on La P?rouse's men, made more poignant by the mysterious loss of the entire expedition the following year, both reflected and contributed to the con test in early 19th century European thought between the images of the noble and the ignoble savage. As I will document through an examination of contemporary narratives, dra mas, and elegiac poetry, Samoan character was maligned, debated, and event ually rehabilitated in Western texts between the 1790s and the 1860s. The transition from condemnation to vindication was initially a svi generis evolution in European thought rather than an objective, after-the-fact evaluation of any actions on the part of the Samoans. The impetus for rethinking the 'ignoble 6 R. D.

The initiative for further contacts was with West erners; further contacts in turn spurred the ongoing revision of views of native character. As will be shown, the Samoans actively participated in their own vindication by telling their side of the La Perouse story to Westerners who were ready to listen. Stereotypie constructs of cultural character and historical encounters are mutually influential. Samoan character, like that of Islanders in general, was rehabilitated in European judgement as the Pacific was brought into the orbit of missionisation and commerce. The ignoble savage, whom Europeans expelled from Eden in the late 18th century, had by the mid-1800s been further trans formed into a potential development resource to be harnessed (ideally) by competing Western powers. The many interpretations of the La Perouse affair were yet another arena in which Anglo-American/French political rivalries in the Pacific were played out. Summarising the period 1820-50 as 'the triumph of science', Smith argues that Stereotypie constructs of generic 'primitives' gave way to 'more particularized . . . and more precise information' about Pacific peoples.12 Western accounts of the incident at Fagas? illustrate this pro gression. During the 24 hours that La Perouse spent at Tutuila his attitude toward the Islanders turned from one of ambivalence and qualified admiration to disgust and disillusionment.13 La. Perouse would have been well acquainted with the published journal of his predecessor Bougainville, who bartered for provisions at Samoa in 1768. Bougainville did not go ashore, nor did the Samoans board his vessel, but on the basis of his limited interaction with them he wrote: 'I do not believe that these men are so gentle as those of Taiti; their features were more savage, and we were always obliged to be upon our guard against their cunning tricks to cheat us by their barter'.14 The invidious comparison with Tahiti is telling; to many 18 th century Europeans the Tahitians represented the arche type of the noble savage or the 'soft' primitive, the artless sensualist surviving with little effort amidst Eden-like plenty. Tahiti 'was like Paradise before the Fall of Man, and the people lived in a natural state of innocence enjoying its bounty'.15 Bougainville's contrast between Samoa and Tahiti can be read as synchronie and particularistic, but it also reflects a more general trend in late 12 Smith, European Vision, 101. is See Jean F.

When La Perouse describes his initial im pressions of Samoa he invokes the familiar imagery of tropical affluence. Like Bougainville, La Perouse was surprised that the Samoans turned down hatchets and iron tools and wanted only glass beads: They were so wealthy, and had so few wants, that they despised our cloths and instruments of iron_abundandy supplied with articles of real utility, they desired nothing but superfluities ... What imagination would not conceive this delightful place the abode of felicity!16 Despite his admiration for what he saw as a benevolent environment and effortless subsistence, La Perouse approached Pacific Islanders with suspicion and distrust even before the killings.17 In one of his last letters he wrote, 'My opinion concerning barbarous natives was long since fixed; and my voyage has served only to confirm that opinion'. After several minor thefts and altercations with the Samoans, La Perouse concluded that 'these islanders were very turbu lent'.18 Certain details, observations, and incidents in the subsequent narrative appear as recurrent motifs in later accounts of the 'massacre'. The disputes that La Perouse considered 'trifling vexations' at the time, the 'forbearance' of the French, the intimidating physique of the Samoans19 all appeared more ominous in retrospect and became the stuff of dramatic irony in the retelling. One inci dent suggested to some later writers that sex was the provoking factor behind the killings. La Perouse recounts that while members of the expedition bartered for provisions on shore, the women 'offered.. . their favours to all'. 'Confusion' ensued when Samoan men approached, 'but some Indians, whom we took for chiefs, appeared armed with sticks, and re-established order'.20 Another altercation occurred on the beach when a Samoan took a mallet and began to beat one of the sailors. La Perouse considered this 'an absolute act of hostility', but one which he 'wished to repress without shedding blood'. He had the sailors toss the man into the water. 'I was informed some private quarrels had occurred', he adds, 'but they had been quashed by extreme prudence.' As a show of force, La Perouse let fly three pigeons and had them shot before the assembled crowd. He expected to achieve more with fear, he comments, than with 'ben evolence, of which men scarcely emerged from the savage state are seldom susceptible'.21 In his journal ? written after the killings ? La Perouse empha sises his restraint, drawing a contrast between the civilised and 'humane' behaviour of the French and the 'savagery' of the ungrateful and unpredictable natives. 16 La Perouse, Voyage, EL, 131. 17 Cf.

Despite the remonstrances of La Perouse ? made much of in later elegies ? de Langle could not be dissuaded; some of the crew showed signs of scurvy, and de Langle asserted that La Perouse would be responsible for the progress of the disease if he opposed the watering party.22 Despite his misgivings, tragically ironic in hind sight, La Perouse yielded. The next day de Langle led a party of 61 armed men into a cove out of sight of the ships. But he had reconnoitred the bay at high tide, and the longboats grounded. Survivors reported that de Langle considered leav ing but was swayed by 'the air of gentleness and tranquillity that appeared among the people', who were waiting with provisions to barter.25 As the watering proceeded canoes returning from their market with the French ships filled the bay and the crowd swelled from 200 to 1,000 or 1,200 people. De Vaujuas, the officer who led the retreat from the bay, offered his own theory of the provoking incident in his report: de Langle made presents of a few beads to a sort of chiefs, who had assisted in keeping the islanders a litde at a distance. We were certain, however, that this kind of police was mere mockery... These presents... excited the discontent of all the rest; a general clamour then arose, and we were no longer able to check it.24 Stones began to fly, but de Langle was reluctant to fire. La P?rouse's explanation for this restraint provided poetic and narrative material for later writers: If the fear of... being accused of barbarity, had not checked Mr. de Langle, he would... have ordered a general discharge of his swivels and musketry ... but he flattered himself that he could check them without shedding blood, and he fell a victim to his humanity.25 Though the men in the boats were unable to reload their muskets before they were overwhelmed, many more Samoans than French died at Fagas? that day. In a letter written at Botany Bay a few months later La Perouse estimated that 30 Samoans had been killed.26 The news of the fight reached the ships while they were still surrounded by canoes engaging in trade. La Perouse, citing the 'inno cence' of those bartering, restrained his crew from firing on them: 'the voice of my conscience saved their lives'. Although he tacked back and forth for two days, La Perouse was unable to get within cannon range of shore without placing his ship in further danger, and he left without exacting vengeance.27 Smith notes that the La Perouse description of Samoa is 'probably the first account which seeks to contrast the beauty of the Polynesian islands with the 22 Ibid., 132-3.

Tattooed, wearing skirts of cordyline leaves, the men resembled 'the river-gods of myth ology ... their countenances ... always expresss astonishment or choler ... Almost all of them are covered with scars, which must have been the consequences of... private quarrels.' La Perouse provided a compelling meta phor for ignoble savagery when he described the cove, which became known to Europeans as 'Massacre Bay', as 'more fearful from it's [sic] treacherous situ ation, and the cruelty of it's inhabitants, than the lair of a lion or tiger'.29 The La Perouse narrative is permeated with a sense of betrayal, as might be expected of one whose Rousseauesque expectations had been cruelly dashed. Judging from the navigator's own writings, it appears more accurate to say that the affair at Fagas? confirmed his worst suspicions. In any case, the moral of the event was utterly clear to La Perouse, as it would be to Europeans who learned of it: I am... a thousand times more angry with the philosophers, who so enthusiastically extol savage nations, than with the savages themselves ... Lamanon [naturalist on the Boussole],... told me, the evening before his death, that these men were better than ourselves ... A navigator ... ought to consider the savages as enemies ... whom, without sufficient reason, it would be ... barbarous to destroy; but whose hostile attempts he has a right to prevent.30 The first published account of the affair at Fagas? was probably that of Cap tain John Hunter, commander of the British frigate Sirius*1 La Perouse arrived at Botany Bay only five days after Captain Phillip and the First Fleet. The British were then removing to Port Jackson, 10 miles away by land. The French stayed at Botany Bay about two months while they rebuilt their longboats, during which time they had 'frequent intercourse' with the British camped to the north.32 Hunter heard the story of the massacre only a month after the event, but his retelling is notably lacking in philosophical or moral reflections. This may have been a matter of personal style, or perhaps as one navigator to another La Perouse only communicated what he deemed pragmatically useful information. Hunter recorded a theory of what went wrong on the beach: 'Some altercation ... in consequence of their pressing so close upon the French, probably oc 28 Smith, European Vision, 103. Smith is incorrect when he refers to the location as 'Manu'a'. La Perouse called Tutuila 'Maouna' and Upolu 'Oyalava'. Erskine thought that La Perouse had confused Tutuila with the Manu'a islands to the east; John Elphinstone Erskine, Journal of a Cruise Among the Islands of the Western Pacific (London 1967, first pub. 1853), 5. But linguistic confusion is equally possible as an explanation for the errors. 'Oyalava' is evidently the Samoan o ia lava which, depending on intonation, means 'that's it exactly' or 'is that it? Manga in Samoan means 'mountain' and is also one of the highest chiefly titles of Tutuila. 29 La Perouse, Voyage, II, 154, 138. so Letter to Fleurieu, 7 Feb. 1788, ibid., 506. si Hunter, Journal, 290. 32 La Perouse to Minister of the Marine, 5 Feb. 1788; Voyage, II, 479.</page><page sequence="7">IGNOBLE SAVAGES AND OTHER EUROPEAN VISIONS 9 casioned a blow with a club... which was instantly taken as a signal by the rest, and the massacre began'.ss We cannot know whether this reconstruction originated with Hunter or with the French. The significant point is that unlike many subsequent interpreters, the English sea captain viewed the encounter as tragic but fortuitous, an 'unfortu nate' mistake in interpersonal relations between cultural strangers. La Perouse evidently attempted to convey to Hunter an objective ethnographic account of the Samoans. According to Hunter, he described the Samoans 'as a very strong and handsome race of men... the women are delicately beautiful; their canoes, houses, &amp;c. are well constructed, and they are much more advanced in internal policy and order than any of the islands in the Pacific Ocean'.34 La Perouse did, however, warn Captain Phillip to beware of their 'perfidious caresses'.35 The subsequent fate of La Perouse made the Fagas? 'massacre' a portentous and philosophically significant event in retrospective Western accounts. In one of the great mysteries of maritime history, the Astrolabe and Boussole left Botany Bay to explore the islands to the northeast and disappeared. The La Perouse expedition was the subject of rumour, speculation, drama, poetry, and unsuc cessful research for 40 years,36 until in 1827 a controversial Irish mariner named Peter Dillon tracked some relics to Vanikoro in the Solomon Islands. The following year the French navigator Dumont d'Urville confirmed the findings that both ships had been wrecked on the reefs of Vanikoro and no survivors were left alive.37 The events of the La Perouse voyage were well publicised in Europe in the 1790s. Hunter's account of his meeting with La. Perouse appeared in 1793. French editions of the La Perouse journal were published in 1797 and 1798, and an abridged version in 1799. Several English language versions saw print in Great Britain between 1798 and 1801. The Mitchell Library in Sydney holds a 1799 Swedish edition, German versions published in 1800 and 1804, and an 1815 Italian edition. Clearly, the story of La Perouse gripped European imaginations at the turn of the century. La Perouse was to the French what Cook was to the British. The two were frequently likened to one another and many Europeans were convinced 33 Hunter, Journal, 290. 34 Ibid. 35 La Perouse to Minister of the Marine, 5 Feb. 1788; Voyag?, II, 479. 36 The French government sponsored an expedition led by dTLntrecasteaux in 1791 but it ended in disaster.

The uncertainty gave rise to a lore of La Perouse which flourished in literature and art during the 40-year period of mystery sur rounding his fate.39 La Perouse became a tragic and romantic hero in plays and pantomimes. These do not dramatise the events reported in the journal but present fanciful depictions of the navigator's adventures after he is shipwrecked on a South Sea island. The portrayal of natives in these plays is informed by the affair at Fagas?, but the characters are not identified as the inhabitants of any specific, known island group. Rather, they are generic natives, who act out European projections of 'primitive' character. As early as 17 99 a two-act play, La Perouse, by the German playwright Augustus von Kotzebue, was translated into English and performed at the Theatre Royal in London.40 The work was published in New York in 1800 and apparently enjoyed considerable popularity.41 The plot involves a romantic triangle between La Perouse, a native chief's daughter, and his French wife, who arrives in a ship searching for him. The jealous native woman and her father were stock charac ters in La Perouse dramas through the 1850s.42 As the plots become more complicated, these popular works present a very mixed picture of Islanders. Noble and ignoble savagery are typically juxtaposed in the same piece: rep resented by different locales, personified in different characters, or played out in a single mercurial character who undergoes changes of heart. Perhaps the most venerable of the La Perouse pieces was La Perouse, or, The Desolate Island, described in 1801 as 'the pantomimical Drama .. . Performing, with unbounded applause, at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden'.43 A theatrical advertisement for an 1818 London performance of this 'GRAND HISTORICAL BALLET DRAMA' refers to it as 'the established favourite', staged 'BY PAR TICULAR DESIRE (21st Time in this Theatre)'.44 It was also performed in Newcastle in 1808,45 and evidently there were many other productions. The La Perouse plays utilise the conventional constructions of the era, pitting a gen eric Western tragic hero against undifferentiated primitives. The 1818 perform ance was distinguished by the guest appearance of 'NATIVE AMERICAN INDIANS, Lately arrived in England', playing supporting roles as natives. The 3? E.g.f Delattre, P?tition, 3-4.

It should be noted that in his journal La Perouse, like other mariners of his time, refers to all indigenous peoples as 'Indians'. Ronald Meek points out that in 18th century European philosophy Pacific Islanders were equated with American Indians as archetypal representatives of savage humanity.46 The volume The Life of La Perouse, already in its third London edition in 1801, includes a summary of the voyage and an elaboration of the pantomime, which portrays the navigator's 'Adventures in a Desolate Island on the Northern Coast of Japan; where he was discovered by Madame La Perouse'. The voyage sum mary devotes considerable space to the Tutuila 'massacre' and reiterates the contrasts between the beauty of the country and the ferocity of the inhabitants, and between the 'humanity' of the French and the treachery of the 'diabolical' natives. Certain narrative details are embellished to underscore the point. The Samoans have slings to hurl their stones and the number of attackers is inflated to 'more than ten thousand men'.47 In the fictional 'history' that follows, the shipwrecked La Perouse is saved through the intercession of 'the chief Indian's daughter'. Although the locale is said to be an island off the northern coast of Japan, the 'Indians' are categorically distinguished from mainland Asians: they manifest 'a degree of ferocity ... in contradistinction to the gentle manners of the natives of the continent'. A vessel carrying Mme La Perouse searches for the navigator, visiting en route the idyllic and peaceful land of'Asperia', whose inhabitants 'live principally upon milk and vegetables'. The Asperians' highest value is 'filial piety' and their worst punish ment is temporary banishment, 'inflicted for disobedience to parents'. When Mme La Perouse arrives the native woman's love is 'changed into the most implacable hatred', but La Perouse is able to prevail on her sentiments. After the Europeans repulse an attack by the Islanders, she agrees never to see La Perouse again. La Perouse is delayed on the island by his wife's indisposition, while the French ship sails on to discover another land, also inhabited by 'Indians' but manifesting a surprising degree of culture. The 'regularity' of the fields and the 'neat' architecture are explained by the presence of a shipwrecked English man.48 La Perouse pantomimes and plays were performed throughout England into the 1840s. They feature an animal character, 'Chimpanzee', who saves La. Perouse and his wife from hostile natives.49 An anthropomorphic animal is thus protrayed as more merciful ? indeed, more humane ? than the indigenous people. Though the 'savages' are for the most part depicted as treacherous en 46 Ronald L.

The native woman is volatile and mercurial ? qualities congruent with the prevailing view of primitive nature ? but is susceptible to appeals for mercy. She is at first loving, then vengeful, but in the end remorseful The character fits the profile of the 'romantic savage' which became prominent in 19th century art and litera ture.50 The Desolate Island narrative is noteworthy for its use of different islands to symbolise contrasting aspects of native character, a device reminiscent of GvLlwefs Travels. In contrast to the ignoble savages who threaten La Perouse, the 'gentler' Asperians personify the 'soft' or noble primitive. They also may be intended to represent a higher stage of moral and social development. Meek traces a linkage between mode of subsistence and 'relative degree of civilisation' in Western thought from classical writers to the 18th century philosphers.51 Thinkers from Tacitus to Montesquieu saw societies practicing 'agriculture and pasturage' as more advanced than those relying on hunting.52 The cultured island described last in the narrative completes a hypothetical sequence of de velopment and foreshadows the vision that would come to prevail among Westerners: that Islanders are benighted savages in their native state but can be transformed through the tutelage and leadership of Europeans.53 Less fanciful theories about the fate of La Perouse were bruited in British publications during the early 1800s. In 1802 the Naval Chronicle printed an Amer ican sea captain's report that an unidentified ship with many sick aboard had been attacked by 'Islanders' who 'massacred' the crew and destroyed the vessel. The editor opined that the report seemed to confirm 'conjectures that have been formed of the unfortunate Navigator's having been massacred, with all his crew'.54 In 1804 another mariner reported sighting a small boat carrying La Perouse and some of his crew at the Cape of Good Hope, but the London Review writer sought to debunk this and other rumours that La Perouse might have survived: 'Every year has given birth to a number of different reports, and almost all contradictory'. La Perouse, the writer asserted, must have 'perished before he could reach any inhabited shore'.55 In 1810 an officer found a bottle carrying letters written in French buried at the foot of a tree in Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania); this was billed as 'Discovery of Papers Relating to the Chevalier de La Peyrouse'.56 Another massacre report was submitted as a 'Communication concerning La Perouse' in 1816.57 50 See Smith, European Vision, 247-8. In the Preface (p. vii) to the second edition of his book (Sydney 1985), however, Smith cautions against readings that would posit a unitary European vision of the primitive, and stresses that there were contending views throughout the period under discussion. 5i Meek, Social Science, 11-12, 152-3. 52 Ibid., 12.

The themes are formulaic: the French admire 'l'aspect ravissant' and 'l'abondance' of the islands, but La Perouse is disquieted by the islanders' 'traits farouches'. De Langle goes despite his commander's 'pressentiments funestes'. The Samoans are portrayed as 'hypocrites' whose physical superiority over the French renders them audacious.58 The 1827 elegiac poem 'La Peyrouse' depicts the expedition's progress from the frozen north of Kamchatka to the tropics in idyllic terms: 'c'est un nouvel Eden. ..'. But 'ce monarque splendide,/Riche de tant de biens, nourrit un coeur avide.'59 In the French elegies the fight at Fagas? is no unfortunate accident borne of misunderstanding, but a deliberate and deceitful attack by savages who lure the French to their shores and then assail them. The 1827 poem repeatedly uses the word 'perfide' in reference to the place and its people. The trope of the tiger's den is employed to describe the Samoans signalling the arrival of the boats: 'cette f?roce joie/Des tigres saisissant leur innocente proie'.60 Vinaty's 1823 elegy recounts de Vaujuas' explanation for the fight: that some presents given to chiefs aroused the cupidity of all, and led to 'un massacre g?n?ral'.61 De Langle is the victim 'd'un coeur confiant, g?n?reux'. Carrying through the theme of savage avarice, the poem depicts the Samoans reaping the fruits of the attack: 'la horde sanguinaire/Distribue ? chacun son coupable salaire./Richesse, voil? donc tes funestes effets!' But La Perouse refuses to take vengeance against innocents: 'refuser une vengeance facile et s?re . . . c'est l'h?ro?sme de l'humanit?'. The event's meaning for Europeans was bound up with the lingering mystery of the navigator's death: 'Est-il tomb? sous les coups d'une horde barbare, comme de Langle et Lamanon?'62 The 1827 poem succinctly states the moral of the story, that the tropics harbour human hypocrisy and deceit: 'Tout est calme en ces lieux, mais ce calme est perfide'.63 At least some mariners of this period were convinced that the natives of 'Maouna' were dangerous.64 When the Russian explorer Otto von Kotzebue stopped at Samoa in 1824 he expected the worst from 'the descendants of the barbarian murderers', and interpreted every aspect of the Samoans' behaviour and appearance in negative terms. Drawing the conventional negative compari son with Tahiti, Kotzebue introduces the natives of Maouna as 'perhaps the most ferocious people to be met with in the South Sea'. At 'Massacre Bay' a canoe came out to them, but Kotzebue believed that 'they seemed disposed to storm 58 J. A.

Like Bougainville and La Perouse, Kozebue saw evidence of savagery in the Samoans' facial expressions.65 Not only are the Samoans likened to 'the beasts of the deserts', but Kotzebue attributes to them that Western fetish about ignoble savages, cannibalism: One of them was so tempted by the accidental display of a sailor's bare arm, that he could not help expressing his horrible appetite for human flesh; ? he snapt at it with his teeth, giving us to understand.. . that such food would be very palatable... This proof... conjured up... the detestable meal which the unfortunate Frenchmen had doubtlessly afforded to their murderers.66 Kotzebue's description of Samoa is perhaps the most hostile of any writer, including that of La Perouse himself. By the 1820s English mariners were already questioning the ignoble savage interpretation of the Fagas? affair. The unrav elling of the La Perouse mystery in 1828 contributed to a further progression in European notions of Pacific Islanders. From the 1820s the ignoble savage view persisted, especially in popular literature, at the same time that a more prag matic and particularistic approach to indigenous peoples was gaining ground.67 The debate over Samoan character in visitors' published accounts must be seen in the context of these competing European constructions. The ignoble savage theme seems to have been promulgated longer by the French, who lost a national hero in La Perouse. An elegiac ode inspired by an exposition honouring La Perouse and Dumont d'Urville places the two in a pantheon with Cook and explicitly debunks the earlier philosophy that ennobled primitive peoples: 'Qu'a-t-il vu sur des bords sauvages?/L?che ?go?sme et trahison . . . [sic]/Loin tous les r?ves des faux sages/.. ./Cette absurde philosophie/Qui consacre, qui d?ifie/Une ignorante libert?.'68 It is possible that by this time the theme was considered 'old hat' even in France, but the subject apparently made for an entertaining dinner piece; the poem was presented at a banquet of old and new students of Juilly. Sensationalistic accounts of the Fagas? 'massacre' can also be found in works intended for British audiences. Chapter 2 of the 1845 Perils and Adventures on the Deep, entitled 'Attacks of Savages', begins with the affair at Tutuila.69 Popular French works of the same period also devote considerable space to the 'mass 65 Otto von Kotzebue, A New Voyage Round the World in the Years 1823-1826 (New York 196 7, first pub. 1830), I, 253-64. 66 Ibid., 263.

But this savage freedom is anything but admirable; Vinaty's elegy describes the people of the Navigators Islands as 'libres mais barbares'.72 Noting the discover ies at Vanikoro, Gu?rin cites as consolation the likelihood that La Perouse perished in the waves rather than falling into the hands of the natives, 'et qu'il n'aurait point servi avec ses compagnons, assassin? comme Cook, ? l'horrible festin des anthropophages'.73 There is no evidence for cannibalism on Vanikoro, but this canard was part of the Stereotypie construction of the ignoble savage, the inverse of civilised man. Similarly, artistic representations of the death of de Langle 'depict the Poly nesian as a violent, treacherous, and somewhat contemptible foe'.74 The engrav ing in Gu?rin shows de Langle reeling, in a sacrificial pose reminiscent of works portraying the 'massacre' of the missionary John Williams.75 As generic primi tives the Samoans wear loincloths, carry spears, and some appear to have feathers in their topknots, drawing an equation with American Indians. The engraving in Mont?mont uses tattooing to emphasise the Samoans' muscularity and demonic appearance.76 Tattooed swirls are depicted on the Samoans' elbows, chest, and shoulder blades, so that the back of de Langle's attacker resembles the face of a pagan idol. Smith notes that such portrayals make 'a notable departure' from 'the conventions of soft prirnitivisrn' and mark a shift in European representations of Polynesians.77 Depictions such as these persisted in popular works long after the writings of mariners and missionaries had begun to challenge simplistic views of Pacific peoples as generalised primitives. I will now examine revisionist interpretations of the Fagas? 'massacre' which simul taneously reflected and contributed to the development of a more pragmatic and differentiated vision of Pacific Islanders in the 19th century. The first published explanation of the affair at Fagas? in terms more favour able to the Samoans is attributed to George Bass, surgeon on HMS Reliance and later provisioner to the Port Jackson settlement. The story appears in the 1814 Naval Chronicle but is said to derive from Bass's stop at the Navigators several years earlier, allegedly the first time a Western ship had called since 'the '0 L?on Gu?rin, Les Navigateurs Francais: Histoire des Navigation, Decourvertes et Colonisations Fran?aises (Paris 1847); Albert Mont?ment, Voyages autour du Monde et en Oceanic (Paris 1853). 71 Gu?rin, Navigateurs, 495. 72 Vinaty, ?loge, 24. 7S Gu?rin, Navigateurs, 499. 74 Smith, European Vision, 104.

The chronology in the narrative would make the year of Bass's visit c. 1806, although Gilson gives the year as 1802.79 The beachcomber assured Bass that the natives were 'a friendly race of people', and that the cause of 'the unfortunate affair was not, as stated by the French, the liberty taken with the native females, but... an indignity offered to one of their chiefs whilst on board one of the ships'.80 Despite its fourth-hand quality the account resonates with some well-known aspects of Samoan culture, notably the prevalence of formal food prestations and the highly valued etiquette governing exchange. The 'indignity' involved a French officer's refusal to accept a gift. A chief repeat edly attempted to present a roast pig to a young officer much busied with the affairs of the ship. The harried lieutenant eventually struck the chief with his sword, drawing blood. The Samoan jumped overboard, swam to shore, and urged 'his tribe' to take revenge on the watering party.81 This narrative offers not only an alternative version of the event, but an alternative reading of the La Perouse journal. The incident involving Samoan women on the beach was separate in time and place from the attack on de Langle's party.82 The quarrel with the mallet-wielding Samoan receives more narrative attention in the journal, but La Perouse considered neither incident to be serious.83 Neither La Perouse nor the witnessing officer attributed the cause of the 'massacre' to sexual possessiveness by Samoan men. Rather, the journal depicts 'cupidity' as the primary motive.84 Nevertheless, some later pundits favoured the 'sex' theory, which accorded with certain stereotypes of French national character. More than a century after the event the German ethnologist Augustin Kr?mer blamed the French for initiating sexual liaisons, 'which must have enraged the Samoan young men. For here there is no question of [the women] willingly giving themselves away ... La Perouse shows this only too clearly.'85 Samoan women's sexuality has been the subject of much discussion within anthropology in the past decade. Further exploration of the issue is beyond the scope of this paper, but what La Perouse 'shows only too clearly' in his journal is a matter of interpretation. Kramer's assertion of sexual conserva tism may be appropriate only for the post-Christian era. Such revisionist explanations of the event reflected the national rivalries of the time. The Naval Chronicle piece claims to correct a 'French' theory of the event and also implicitly criticises a French officer for boorishness, insensitivity, and 78 Naval Chronicle, 31 (1814), 380. 79 Gilson, Samoa, 67. so Naval Chronicle, 31 (1814), 380. ?i Ibid. 82 La Perouse, Voyage, 128-9. 8S Ibid., 131. 84 Ibid., 136-7. 85 Kr?mer, Samoan Islands, II ( 1 ), 22-3.</page><page sequence="15">IGNOBLE SAVAGES AND OTHER EUROPEAN VISIONS 17 brutality. The rehabilitation of Samoan character in accounts of the affair at Fagas? was carried on for the most part by English and American writers. An unidentified mariner visiting Manu'a and Tutuila in 1823 had problems with theft and had to ransom himself from a chief's custody, yet his account draws no 'ignoble savage' moral lessons. Reflecting on the La Perouse affair, he criticises the French for errors in practical judgement: I am aware that my opinion of these peoples differs very widely from that of the unfortunate Perouse... Going on shore... with so many things about them... was certainly throwing too great a temptation in their way... To me it always appeared most absurd for an individual to land amongst any of these islanders armed or with anything valuable ... the more homely he is dressed the safer he will be.86 An 1834 geography book contrasts the philosophers' idealisation of primitive peoples with the betrayal felt by La Perouse but concludes, 'both views are equally superficial Savage and civilized people differ little in their conduct when placed in similar circumstances.'87 This relativistic statement (which implicitly criticises La Perouse for naivety) appears remarkable when compared to Kotzebue's angry denunciation of a decade earlier. Neither view, perhaps, can accurately be called representative of European thought regarding Pacific Islanders, for by this time disparate visions were being bandied about. Malte Brun's statement reflects one direction; as Meek notes, some contemporary 'moral philosophers' took the view that the behaviour of primitives must be understood as a product of their 'circumstances'.88 Despite Stereotypie representations of the ignoble savage in missionary pub lications, the writings of resident missionaries ultimately contributed to a more particularistic understanding of Pacific Islanders. A watershed event for Euro pean attitudes toward Samoa was the arrival of John Williams in 1830.89 Williams's experiences in Samoa can only be called positive, the prognosis for Christianity optimistic.90 Williams saw ample evidence of the Samoans' fierce ness in warfare, but their bellicosity was directed at internal enemies. The Savai'i chief Malietoa Vai'inup? welcomed the missionaries with ceremonial gifts and promised to protect the native teachers Williams left under his patronage;91 the promise was kept. At least superficially, Christianity made an easy conquest in Samoa.92 The missionaries who followed Williams described in detail for their reading public the 'barbarous practices' and 'hindrances to Christianity' they found in the field, but they did not portray the Samoans as unpredictable mur ?6 Journal in William Elyard papers, ML MSS A2884/4. 87 M.

More directly, the missionaries in Samoa actively participated in the vindication of Samoan character by promulgating an influential revisionist version of the La Perouse affair. Byl837 there were seven LMS mission stations in Samoa.94 In 1837-38 Cap tain Bethune of HMS Conrvay interrupted his pursuit of escaped convicts to negotiate with Samoan chiefs the first commercial port regulations. According to some reports Bethune's code was instigated by the Tutuila missionary A. W. Murray, who acted as his interpreter.95 It was probably Murray who related to Bethune a second Samoan version of the Fagas? 'massacre': The quarrel at Tutuila ... is supposed to have been instigated by a party from Manono.. . Finding they could not participate in the... trade... having nothing to dispose of... they therefore got up a row, that they might help themselves in the confusion... visitors have looked on [the Samoans] with great suspicion. From all I can collect, their general character is quite the reverse.96 The missionaries in Samoa played a major role as interpreters and informants for the explorers of the 1830s, who sought to implement 'a more objective approach to the delineation of native peoples'.97 The avowedly scientific goals of these expeditions included evaluating the potential of the different island groups for development and trade. Not coincidentally, the published reports of these voyages mark a turning point in European representations of Samoan character. The 'visiting party' theory, well publicised by the missionaries, became the most frequently cited explanation for the fight at Fagas?. Murray attested that an old man of Asu, near Fagas?, told him the trouble was caused by a visiting party {m?laga) from Falealili, in Upolu.98 In 1839 Murray related this account to Wilkes, of the United States Exploring Expedition.99 Even the French finally heard the Samoan ? or, perhaps more accurately, the Tutuilan ? version of the event, with an additional detail that suggested the Samoans bore no ill will toward the French. At Tutuila in 1831 Lafond de Lurcy was told that one of the men in de Langle's party had survived and was living with his Samoan wife and children.100 The 'visiting party' story and the rumour 93 The same cannot necessarily be said for Melanesians. Williams was killed in 1839 at Erromanea in the New Hebrides. Another paper could be written about differential European perceptions of Polynesians and Melanesians. 94 Gunson, Messengers, 19. 95 Gilson, Samoa, 147-8. 96 Bethune, 'Samoan*, 755. 97 Smith, European Vision, 254-6. 98 A.

Dumont d'Urville had seen the wreckage of the La Perouse expedition in Vanikoro a decade earlier, but recriminations are notably absent from his 1838 account. Dumont d'Urville's second voyage was a prelude to further French commercial and religious contacts with Samoa; a French ship landed the first Catholic missionaries in 1845, and a French trading company was formed the same year.102 In LMS narratives the 'visiting party' theory of the affair at Fagas? is combined with a tale of French brutality similar to the George Bass account. George Turner, who spent 40 years in Samoa, elaborates this revisionist, pro-Samoan interpretation in terms highly critical of the French: A native. . . was roughly dealt with, for some real or supposed case of pilfering. The poor fellow was ... mortally wounded, and, when taken on shore bleeding and dying, his enraged companions roused all... to seek instant revenge ... The only inference, probably, which ought to have been drawn from this tragic occurrence was, that heathen natives have a keen sense of justice, and that if men will go upon the disproportionate principle of a life for a tooth, and shoot a man for a perfect trifle, they must abide by the consequences .. . alas! it is often the case that ven geance falls not on the guilty, but on some unsuspecting visitor.103 Turner's accusatory tone is matched by an engraving entitled, revealingly, 'Fight at Tutuila, in which M. de Langle and Others Fell'.104 As in other such works the affray at the longboats occupies a central space, but here the vantage point is the beach. The combatants appear tiny and indistinct in the background, while dead and wounded Samoans litter the shore. The engraving graphically represents the Samoan side of the event. Turner's criticisms are also comprehensible in the light of the adversarial relationship between French and English in the Pacific in the 1840s, one dimension of which was sectarian rivalry. The 'indignity' explanation, which blames the French for provoking the mass acre, became an open reproach in the hands of some British and American writers. Citing Murray, Wilkes claims that the French 'mortally wounded' a young man who stole an iron bolt. His 'enraged' companions, visiting from A'ana district, then went ashore and attacked the watering party.105 Wilkes adds loi Jules S.-C.

Note that the reputed origin of the traveling party differs in these accounts.

Charged with capturing a chief who had led an attack on an American whaling party in 1834, Wilkes cites the incident as possibly corroborating the Samoans' ferocity. But he explicitly vindicates them for early altercations with foreigners, citing as a probable cause 'the just resentment they in some cases manifested for wrongs committed on them by lawless visitors'.107 His attitude illustrates the evolving particularity of the Western approach to Pacific peoples. By the 1830s an attack on Westerners was treated as a crime committed by individuals rather than an offence by a 'savage race'. The murderous chief is a criminal to be caught and punished ? a deviant rather than a representative type. Wilkes describes the Samoans' positive traits in terms reminiscent of the fictional 'Asperians': 'Both sexes show great kindness and love for their chidlren', and age is respected. In marked contrast to La Perouse and Kotzebue, who saw treachery in Samoan facial expressions, Wilkes writes: 'I was much struck here with the manliness and intelligence of the natives, and with their frank open expression of countenance'.108 Wilkes's revisionist history of the La Perouse affair is presented as a search for the truth, aimed at dispelling irrational and exaggerated fears about Pacific Islanders.109 With the exception of some French publications, most subsequent accounts of the 'massacre' are sympathetic to the Samoans.110 The rationalist critique of earlier voyagers was made even more explicit by Captain John Erskine, who made an inspection cruise of the South Pacific in 1849. Erskine was well acquainted with the reports of Bethune and Wilkes and clearly saw his generation of voyagers as superior to their predecessors in their approach to native peoples. In the introductory remarks to his Journal Erskine pointedly outlines the 'more enlightened' philosophy he adopted for his cruise: it seemed doubtful whether most of the atrocities said to have been perpetrated by the islanders had not been provoked by acts of aggression or misconduct on the part of the white men. It was therefore determined that no act of hostility towards any of the native inhabitants should originate with us . . .ln 106 Ibid., 74; cf.

Dif ferentiating himself from earlier, less scientific mariners, Erskine introduces his journal as a factual and objective narrative, free of philosophy and speculation: 'the reader is spared.. . details of difficulties and perils which often exist only in the imagination, and may generally be overcome or avoided by the ordinary exercise of seamanship and prudence'.112 Erskine's portrayal of the Samoans wholly contradicts the La Perouse account. He calls them 'a gentle and polite people', praises their 'punctilious politeness' and describes the crew's 'feeling of regret in parting' from this 'most agreeable' population. At Manu'a the Samoans would not come out to the ship to trade, for an unimpeachable and civilised reason: it was Sunday. And the Fagas? 'mass acre'? As 'an act of justice to the islanders' Erskine corroborates the account told to Wilkes: that a man who had come from Upolu 'on a pleasure excursion' was shot by the French, and his companions took revenge on de Langle's party. Citing the La Perouse journal, Erskine passes harsh judgement on the French. In contrast, the Samoans behaved almost honourably: 'if the statement of the first aggression having taken place on the part of the French is correct, the whole case is materially altered, as few would blame even civilized men for endeavouring to avenge the death of a comrade'.113 This expression of empathy is an important index of the extent to which Samoans were beginning to be seen as people with values and reactions not markedly different from those of Europeans. International rivalries contributed to the historical dynamic propelling this reassessment. Erskine's judgement re flects his avowed rationalism and his aim of correcting past misconceptions. But English/French political tensions in the Pacific and local English/French conflicts in Samoa are also part of the context of the 1840s and 50s.114 Erskine's fulsome praise of the Samoans seems to vary inversely with his criticism of the French: perhaps an example of sympathy for the 'enemy of my enemy'. La Perouse made 'remarkable mistakes' in the names of the Samoan islands. Given his crew's activities on shore 'we may be pardoned for supposing that the islanders were not likely to be impressed with .. . the moral superiority of the strangers', Erskine comments.115 Even Dumont d'Urville comes in for criticism. In 1838, when a chief asked him to pay the harbour dues, Dumont d'Urville, 'in a different spirit from the American and British commanders, referred him indignantly to the battery of his corvette for payment'.ll6 Erskine also chides Dumont d'Urville 112 Ibid, 5. us Ibid, 70, 10, 57-8. lu See Gilson, Samoa, 168-75. 115 Erskine, Journal, 5, 58. ne Ibid, 105.</page><page sequence="20">22 JOURNAL OF PACIFIC HISTORY for ungracious remarks about Captain Bethune and the English mission aries.117 Erskine cites the Samoans' conduct toward foreigners in times of war ? particularly the respect generally shown for foreign property ? as a convincing rebuttal of their earlier reputation: 'I do not believe there is a country in the world ... where a white man can live with such a sense of safety'.118 He even takes the native side in explaining away the burning of a chapel: one of the missionaries told him it was probably ignited accidentally and, in any case, it belonged to the natives because they had built it.119 But for all his compliments and his attempts to render their behaviour understandable, Erskine does not idealise the Samoans in their native state. He portrays them as misrepresented, not as noble savages. Moreover, he sees their admirable behaviour in the 1840s as an improvement from a 'formerly barbarous' state, attributable 'in great measure, to their communication with a good class of white men, and to the teaching of the missionaries'.120 At least in Anglo-American opinion, the Samoans of the mid-19th century came to resemble the cultured Islanders in the fictional Life of La Perouse: savages transformed and bettered through the influ ence of 'civilized men'. In the middle third of the century the revisionist pro-Samoan version of the Fagas? affair superseded the 'ignoble savage' interpretation. Moreover, in the dominant rendering of the event the 'visiting party' explanation was subordi nated to the theme of French 'indignity' against the Samoans.121 Now neither an unfortunate accident of the beach nor the result of imprudent behaviour, the Fagas? affair became an illustration of French brutality and overreaction, to be retold in vigorous defence of the Samoans. An indignant popular account asserts that the details of the La Perouse affair were 'more discreditable to his own crew than to the Samoans, although the latter were made to bear all the blame'. A man guilty or merely suspected 'of some trifling act of pilfering . . . was . . . brutally used ... La Perouse branded the Samoans as .. . bloodthirsty savages, ignoring altogether his own unjust and cruel conduct.'122 Constance Gordon-Cumrning not only says that the attack was provoked, but was defensive in nature. The Melanesian/Polynesian contrast is also invoked to reflect favourably on the Samoans who, unlike the Fijians, never practised such 'horrors' as cannibal ism.123 117 See Dumont d'Urville, Voyages, II, 363. us ErskmCyJournaly 86.

But in the mid-19th century the French too were reassessing the nature of native peoples in general and Samoan character in particular. Like the British and Americans, they sought to evaluate the islands' potential for economic and spiritual development. The 1838 visit of Dumont d'Urville furthered both sorts of assessment and produced a positive report of the Samoans. Dumont d'Urville called his stay at Samoa 'idyllic'.124 The scientific goals of the Dumont d'Urville expedition, like those of Wilkes and Erskine, included carefully documenting the peoples and customs of the different island groups. Clearly, the generic categorisation of Pacific Islanders as 'Indians' had become pass?. Smith notes that in artistic representation Dumont d'Urville's sec ond voyage 'marks, in fact, the end of a chapter in the history of the depiction of native peoples'.125 The transition in French thought regarding Pacific Islanders is illustrated by one of the last theatrical contributions to the lore of La Perouse, Le Naufrage de La Perouse.126 Like earlier La Perouse plays, this work does not dramatise events from the journal but presents a fanciful account of the shipwreck and its after math. Most of the action takes place on Vanikoro. The depiction of Pacific Islanders in this piece marks a departure from the 'ignoble savage' vision. The leading native characters are notable for their complexity and their prominence in the drama. Although the inhabitants of Vanikoro are collectively described as 'des sauvages ruses et cruels',127 the native woman and her father veer repeatedly between nobility and ignobility. But like the Samoans' actions at Fagas!, the 'ignoble' behaviour now has a sympathetic explanation: the native heroine was abducted and her mother killed by Europeans. She and her father epitomise the characteristics of the 'romantic savage' as outlined by Smith: 'a great love of personal freedom, a devotion to race and "nation", a temperament which reacted violently and immediately to experience, courage, great emotional depth, and a childlike warmth'.128 Admirable for the most part, these traits make for a certain volatility and provide a ready explanation for altercations between natives and foreigners. As Wilkes said, the Islanders are 'lively', but not necessarily dangerous to the Wes terner who behaves prudently.129 Works such as Le Naufrage eroded the con ceptual distance between Westerners and Pacific Islanders. In the play, as in some retellings of the Fagas? 'massacre', native attacks are explained in terms of sentiments approaching nationalism. The Islanders, in other words, respond to 124 Dumont d'Urville, Voyages, II, 364. 125 Smith, European V?ion, 255. 126 Ennery, Naufrage. 127 Ibid, 64. 128 Smith, European Vision, 248. 129 Wilkes, Narrative, II, 66.</page><page sequence="22">24 JOURNAL OF PACIFIC HISTORY the same sorts of loyalties that arouse Europeans, though they may feel them more intensely. The native has become a sympathetic and fascinating figure, to be viewed with curiosity rather than dread. As I have shown, in the years following the disappearance of La Perouse the Tutuila 'massacre' confirmed growing scepticism about human nature and served as a cautionary tale about Pacific Islanders specifically. Before concluding I will briefly return to the question of historical determinacy: the importance of the 'massacre' in delaying Western impact in Samoa. Further consideration points to the complexity and ambiguity of such historical outcomes. The dates of the sources cited in the first paragraph of this essay suggest that the LMS missionaries in Samoa may have initially formulated the conventional wisdom regarding the La Perouse affair. The earliest writers to emphasise the deterrent value of the event are Bethune and Wilkes, who relied on the missionary Murray for much of their information. Most of the later authors appear to have derived their understanding from Turner or from one of his readers. There is little direct evidence that mariners categorically avoided Samoa because of the event at Fagasa";130 it may be more accurate to say that there was nothing in Samoa to attract them. Kennedy has debunked at length the exaggerated claims of importance ac corded to Samoa by the great powers in the late 19th century.131 Other than provisions, which neighbouring island groups could supply, Samoa possessed no commercially valuable products to lure foreign traders, a fact noted by Wilkes.132 Samoa had no sandalwood or b?che-de-mer and, unlike Hawai'i, pos sessed no unique geographical advantage.133 The Hawaiians killed Captain Cook and had other violent altercations with foreigners at about the same period as the Fagasa incident,134 but these episodes were perceived as anomalous. Cor rectively, Hawaiian character appears to have been rehabilitated in Western texts earlier than the Samoan. The Naval Chronicle for 1814 includes an item on the Hawaiians' reverence for 'the illustrious Cook, whose melancholy fate is to this day deeply and generally deplored by the Sandwich Islanders'. This report, the Chronicle asserts, 'considerably removes the barbarity and savage-like dispo sition, which have been usually attached to the character of these people'.135 The La Perouse affair was not the last violent encounter between Samoans and West erners. A boat from HMS Pandora was attacked at Tutuila in 1791.136 But the frequenting of Hawai'i by fur and sandalwood traders suggests that Western iso See Gilson, Samoa, 66-7. isi Paul Kennedy, The Samoan Tangle (St Lucia, Qld, 1974). 1S2 Wilkes, Narrative, II, 123. lss Kennedy, Samoan Tangle, 2 n.2. 154 See Greg Dening, History's Anthropology: The Death of William Gooch (Lanham, Md 1988) and Ralph S.

Whaling ships pioneered Western trade in Samoa in the 1820s and 30s.138 The fact-finding expeditions of Bethune and Wilkes followed. The missionary printer Samuel Ella dated the inception of'regular commerce' in Samoa at 1839, when John Chauner Williams, son of the martyred missionary, opened a trading busi ness. In 1842 Williams exported the first shipment of coconut oil.139 Coconut products are to this day the group's principal export. The German firm of Godeffroy and Sohn arrived in Samoa in 1857 and their agent perfected the copra-drying process. The first copra plantations were established in 1865140 and from then on Samoa's political economy was intimately tied to Western devel opment dreams. The chronology of Western commerce in Samoa indicates that the reassessment of Samoan character, missionisation, and increasing economic contacts were simultaneous processes. Indeed, in the Samoan case it appears that the natives began to be portrayed more positively even before Westerners increased the frequency of commercial contacts. The salient point is that West ern political-economic expansion necessitated the revaluation of indigenous peoples. The impetus for this rehabilitation originated with the Europeans, who had invented the 'ignoble savage' in the first place. Further contacts in turn spurred the ongoing amelioration of native character in Western represen tations. Notions of the 'savage' had a life of their own in Western thought; the noble and ignoble savage were imaginative and philosophical products, tenuously related to empirical encounters. Although stimulated by early voyagers' ac counts, such constructs did not simply reflect events. Moreover, these a priori notions influenced the tenor of transactions with Islanders. The preconceptions could be confirmed or contradicted by experience, but as the La Perouse affair demonstrates, the meaning of'experience' is never unequivocal. Nor can 19th century Western ideas about indigenous peoples be seen as undifferentiated; sensationalistic portrayals of natives in popular literature coexisted in mid century with reports explicitly aiming to correct such visions with scientific objectivity. Long after Samoans had ceased to be viewed as dangerous or bar baric, the place known to Europeans as 'Massacre Bay' remained a tourist attraction. The location was considered a historic site and was on the itinerary of many 19th century visitors to Samoa.141 is?

And the redemption of the Samoans (I use the word advisedly) was both a prerequisite for further contacts (for capitalist exploitation, some would say) and an ongoing result ofthat closer acquaintance. Missionaries, scientific explorers, and traders in Samoa asserted that the Samoans had been misrepresented, even wronged. These particular Islanders, so receptive to Christianity (and so generous with their contributions), so mindful of foreigners' property, deserved vindication. The pro-Samoan ac counts of the 'massacre' thus resemble a self-fulfilling prophecy operating in reverse. The rehabilitation of native reputations was intimately linked to West ern goals in the Pacific and had a self-propelling quality. Familiarity was as much a product as a cause of the reassessment. Writers such as Bethune, Wilkes, and Erskine presented their retelling of the Fagas? 'massacre' as a rationalist correction to a tale that had attained folkloric stature in Europe. The most-publicised Samoan version of the event appealed to Western empathy and demanded a recognition of Samoan internal differen tiation: troublemakers from outside were responsible, not the Tutuila people. Perhaps the French had even brought it on themselves, the English and Amer icans asserted, with lust, brutality, or lack of a mariner's common sense. In historical retrospect it appears obvious that the La Perouse 'massacre' story could have only a limited career. Like the noble savage vision that preceded it, the ignoble savage had to give way during the course of Western expansion to a more differentiated understanding of Pacific Islanders. On the latter approach could be founded an anthropology that would compare and contrast peoples on the basis of their customs, beliefs, and character. The progression is prefigured in the retellings of the La Perouse affair, in which the Samoans eventually emerge not as 'Indians', nor as 'savages', but as Samoans.</page></plain_text>
