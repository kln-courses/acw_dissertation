<plain_text><page sequence="1">Metaphoric Worlds: Conceptions of a Romantic Nature. By Samuel R. Levin. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988. xv + 251 pp. A new book by Professor Levin, known for his contributions to the linguistic and semantic discussions of poetic language, would be awaited by all comparatists interested in theories of metaphor and poetry. The intriguing double genitive of this work's subtitle will also make it of interest to specialists in the romantic period, for Levin's conceptions are of or drawn from a romantic kind, as well as about or concerned with a distinctly romantic view of nature. One such conception is of a "universe in which the human spirit counted for as much in the ontological schema as did inanimate nature" (168), another is of "the welding of man and nature into an idea of organic and mutually inspiriting relatedness" (235). But it is a theory of metaphor that guides Levin to these thoughts, and despite the orienting function of the target chapter on "Wordsworth and the Kantian Sublime," the study of metaphor and the display of learning that surrounds it remain the main interest of this work. Part of this interest is in the procedure and itinerary by which Levin COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES, Vol. 29, No. 1, 1992. Copyright © 1992.

First, he must position his model of metaphor between linguistics and philosophy, more specifically, between studies of what's meant (semantically) and of what's thought (or con- ceived of), and this leads him to characterize his model as a phenomenon logical approach, concerned with mental intentions. Thus far, he will have discussed some contemporary philosophers, Chomskyan grammati- cal categorizations, some work in the semantics of meaning and repre- sentability, and Husserl. A chapter on "scientific and poetic truth" al- lows Levin to posit that while in science, conceptual growth is a matter of innovation respecting concepts, with novel relations between them coming automatically, in metaphor "the novelty of the expression con- sists in the hitherto unconceived of relation that it projects between preexisting concepts" (104). While these early chapters are not of equal interest or productivity - Levin uneconomically takes his reader on a via negativa through his longest chapter (on Husserl), remarking repeatedly upon what is "inadequate," "failing" or not "arising" in, "escaping" of, and otherwise "essentially uninformative" in his subject's theories - they have a coherence of their own, for they focus on varied but related approaches to the conceptual problem of metaphoric meaning. But then, after some 100 pages, Levin's tactic changes and becomes one of a quasi-chronological series of studies in the history of ideas about lan- guage and mind, from Vico's figuration of the language of the "first poets," to Aquinas's theory of analogy, to Newton's universe and Locke's mind, finally to arrive to Kant and Wordsworth. While I will say some- thing below about the particular lack of distinction of these chapters - more than half of the book - it is here enough to note how they signal a change in project (from the conceptual to the quasi-historical), and to seize this juncture to examine a bit further Levin's conceptual under- standing of metaphor. Under Levin's view, "what is metaphoric is not the language, but the world" (2); "accepting the epistemological consequences" (4) of this will mean "conceiving of the possibility that a state of affairs which exceeds anything that our experience has acquainted us with and which in fact transcends what we know the world to be like might yet somehow obtain" (18). Such "conception of is not definite understanding - the Kantian gathering of an intuition or a representation under a concept - nor "repre- sentability" as the referring (reference) of meaning- intentions to ex-</page><page sequence="3">98 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES tramental conditions. Rather, it is to take a "deviant sentence" (Levin's term) as the occasion, the provocation "to prepare a mental space into which that [conception] might be placed" (69), "to consider its possibility credible, and the crediting of possibility . . . then represents the meaning of the sentence" (59). "In a conception ... we conceive of a state of affairs that lies beyond our worldly experience and we lend credence to its possibility" (99, his emphasis). Levin's thesis in this part of his argument may be summarized as "there is such a thing as conceptual knowledge and ... it may be achieved if we take poetic language literally" (101). These views are, for Levin, "of a romantic nature," and they can yield a banal sense of "visionary poetry": visionary because "what the resulting conceptions are true of is the poet's vision of reality - a reality that is strange and exotic only to minds locked into a conventional ontology" (102), banal because ultimately in "metaphoric construal" we only un- dergo "on the conceptualist approach a (re) vision of reality" (156). They can even yield familiar senses of so-called "romantic" "creativity" or "imagination" such that (after Wordsworth) Levin says "creativity com- prises for me the specific sense of conception" (76), and later elucidates, "for me the imagination is creative in a more fundamental sense, namely, as constituting reality" (200). (The reader is left to mediate across the spectrum of revising, creating, and constituting.) Less grandly perhaps, Levin's "conception" can also reduce to a reader's taking "elements of feeling and affect from his emotional store and form[ing] ... a concep- tion" (80). But such reductions of already-received ideas of a "romantic nature" will ultimately tell us less than will Levin's grappling with a hard- nosed theory of metaphor. The hard-nosed confrontation in Levin's model is between literalness and deviancy. Intentional acts - by poets, for Levin's purposes - prompt deviant expressions, and these semantically (and, sometimes, syntacti- cally) deviant expressions are to be taken literally or, as he says several times, "at face value" (80, 129, 226). To take them as such would be for the reader to close the circle, as it were, by returning deviant expressions to the mental state of intentions whence they issued; but this would be no interpretive closure which understands a speaker's reference or recognizes conceptually his meaning. Rather, "conceiving of the literal meaning of semantically deviant expressions is to conceive of a world become meta- phorical; the "incompatibility" between the deviant expression at hand and a normal conception of the world would lead, in Levin's understand-</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 99 ing, to a literally deviant world, a "metaphoric world." Properly to express this metaphoric conception (or conception of) requires that "the lan- guage suffers deviance, that is, it is used improperly' " (77). Furthermore, "between a deviant sentence and a metaphoric world there in fact does mediate some sort of mental state or process . . . that is associated with the experience we call 'the sublime' " (24, 25), and Levin elsewhere, in an adoption of the language of the sublime, eloquently sketches how acts of conception in his sense "lapse," "bend," "impel," "urge" but "do not reach" "the form[ation] of a clear image" (53). My sense of both the importance and the shortcomings of Levin's model of metaphor and its understanding (or "conception") lies in its deviancy and literalness, for it is not deviant nor literal enough. As his own remark about proper expression of a metaphoric conception requiring improper language might suggest, the literal character of metaphors is that they are figurative, improper, and it is this condition, originative and thoroughgoing in its impropriety, that is all we've got. Levin's examples include "the trees were weeping," "the sea was laughing" (from Words- worth's Prelude) y and "the rose is happy," and he might have added "the speaking face of earth and heaven" (also from The Prelude). But under Levin's model, such metaphors are to lead to a better - because ex- panded, more "creative" or "interrelated" - conception of trees, seas, and roses. But we might notice they are all anthropomorphic, involving per- sonification, and this could lead to a different, more literal understanding of metaphor that also deviates more greatly from a normal view of lan- guage as expression. Levin is of course aware of such "sort crossing" (74), as he calls it, and while he discusses personficiation several times, he in fact shies away from it, calling it the "dispersonification of predicates" (95-98), or fearing that it might be misunderstood as mere pathetic fallacy (204), and not granting it an entry in his index. Catachresis (which does have such an entry) is similarly treated warily, dismissed as "metaphor by default" (9, 121), "a degenerate form of metaphor . . . impl[ying] a deficiency" (128), but here again, the examples are often anthropomorphic, as in a "head of cabbage" or the "mouth of a river." But the latter need be "projections" filling a "cognitive gap" (122) no more than the earlier personifications need be interanimations" or "vitalizings" (226) of objects in nature. In both sets of examples, man is everywhere in an uncanny, sometimes ghastly image of anthropology (knowing man) as a condition of knowability - what it means to know a cabbage, a river, a</page><page sequence="5">100 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES world, or a man. While all the examples could, in the manner of Magritte, be "seen" in very literal senses (Levin does not seem to acknowl- edge this), what would be overlooked in such literalizations as visualiza- tions is the originary power of metaphor as personification, anthropomor- phism, and prosopopeia: to give conditions of knowability to a world and to human being, in the originally improper or figurative appearance of language. A "mouth of a river" or a "speaking face of earth and heaven" is neither a river or earth better conceived of, nor a mere projection of man upon world, but on the face of it (it, all that is) a mouth of language and face of speech that utter not unspeakable thoughts, but speech that we would rather not think too literally, for it says that language is capable of saying and positing anything, from the beginning, and not just what is "expressible," referential, recognizable, or otherwise re-presentable as sense and meaning. In this context, it is especially regrettable that Levin, in considering among his contemporary philosophers of metaphor Lakoff and Johnson, Davidson, and Ricoeur, mentions but dismisses any treat- ment of Derrida on metaphor and catachresis (in "White Mythology"). He also seems unaware of or uninterested in de Man's work on originary metaphor in Rousseau (in Allegories of Reading) and on anthropomorphism and prosopopeia (in The Rhetoric of Romanticism), the former of which would have been very germane to Levin's discussion of metaphor and catachresis in Vico, the latter to his discussion of personification and metaphor throughout. On this last remark, I might turn rapidly to the second half of Levin's study, for it turns, as I noted, on Vico. Here Levin takes Vico literally in a way one might scarcely have expected, not subscribing literally to the proposition that, regarding "the origin and nature of the tropes," "they are all catachretic in their motivation" (121), but rather making Vico into a literal historicist who, in his work, reflects and tells the history of man developing from a "fundamentally different" relation between language and reality to the one it has "for us," in which "what we think the world is like consists essentially with its actual nature" as we have progressed along "the historical process whereby fact and our understanding have been brought into conformity" (119). With this, the initial project of a funda- mental inquiry into a model of metaphor - where Vico might well have been a prime fund - is lost, and we have instead the "literalization" of Vico's metaphors of early man and historicism's metonymies of process and development into Levin's narrative of how "first men" might progress</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 101 via the insights of Aquinas on analogy (vis-à-vis Aristotle's) and the dangers of Newton and Locke, to Kant, Wordsworth, and romantic sub- limity. Needless to say, metaphor gets rather misplaced here, and after the Aquinas chapter one hears less about metaphor as a fundamental problem and more about it as a historical epiphenomenon. Also lost is Levin's tough-mindedness, for the chapters of intellectual history become increas- ingly second hand, relying extensively on a small selection of studies in the history of science and ideas. When one finally comes to Kant and Wordsworth, several things seem wrong. While the brief sketch of Kant on the sublime is not, on the whole, unreliable, one gets no sense of the tension of Kant's argument for and, ultimately, against the sublime - for its necessary place in Kant's systematic argument, for its equally necessary containment and overcoming - any more than one does of the fear and threat associated with the sublime in Wordsworth's Prelude. Levin's asso- ciation of Kant and Wordsworth leads, I think, to several false contrasts, among them the view that Kant has imagination in the service of reason as a limit, while Wordsworth has imagination overcoming a limited view of nature (230); so, too, part of the problem here stems from an early claim that "acts of conceiving" in Levin's sense would be sufficiently "autotelic" (49), while there is no comfort with an autotelic sublimity in either Kant or Wordsworth's arguments. Levin acknowledges Thomas Weiskel's work on Kant and Wordsworth in The Romantic Sublime, which (together with Neil Hertz's in his The End of the Line) is the best study to date, but he does not engage it extensively, and he seems to misunder- stand Weiskel when he wants to align "positive" and "negative" sublimes with "egotistical" and "conceptual" ones (231-35). Equally regrettably, Levin seems unconcerned with the dimensions of the sublime in either The Prelude (the crucial Simp Ion passage is not adduced) or in Words- worth scholarship, where several decades of excellent close reading have been especially and stubbornly attentive to the problem of Wordsworth's language of the sublime, but are unmentioned by Levin. Metaphoric Worlds will remain, in my judgment, less a contribution to comparative studies of romanticism than an attempt toward a theory of metaphor; the chapters on the history of ideas after Aquinas, and espe- cially on Kant and Wordsworth, will probably become the least valuable of its contributions. If its treatment of metaphor is ultimately not as radical as its claims suggest, nor as fundamental as its best instincts might have impelled, its chapters on the problem of metaphor in the history and</page><page sequence="7">102 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES the contemporary work of philosophy and linguistics will deserve a wide readership for the intellectual efforts they clarify and demonstrate.
