<plain_text><page sequence="1">A REVIEW OF RECENT BHAGAVADGITA STUDIES Milton Eder New studies in an historical perspective A milestone year for the BhagavadgJtã (hereafter BG) recently passed before a western reading audience, its 200th anniversary in English translation.1 The BG initially appeared in English through the 1785 translation effort of Sir Charles Wilkins. Its first century was marked by Sir Edwin Arnold's The Song Celestial (1885). Arnold's widely read poetic rendition forms the central star in a constellation of BG studies which appeared in the 1880s (e.g.,K. T. Telang, J. Davies, M. Chatterjee). The anniversary of the second century of the English study of the BG has just passed by, and while no publication with the apparent public allure of Arnold's appeared, scholars continue to show a great interest in the BG. The recent publications reviewed here, and the birth of an annual Journal of Studies in the Bhagavadgita from the Department of Religious Studies, University of Sydney, Australia, evidences interest in the BG from a number of disciplinary and ecclesiastical sources and suggests that western interest in the text shows no sign of waning. Continuing to shine more brightly than any other text in the western understanding of Indian thought and religion, the BG occupies this preeminent position because westerners have come to see in the BG a clear statement of a human devotional religion in which human beings seek a personal reltationship to god. This interpretation led to arguments over the priority of eastern or western scripture with some scholars in the mid-nineteenth century suggesting New Testament influence on the BG.2 The comparison of religious ideas which allowed people to perceive the BG's knowledge of god as a branch from the trunk of Christian theology was in turn rejected by those who percieved in the BG prominence of the Indian concept of bhakti, or devotion. Those who emphasized the devotional philosophy of the text understood the BG's message as a clear statement of people's relationship with a personal god. This theological distinction between the idea of a single god and of a personal god was grasped in a question variously answered: Does god exist independently of or subjectively within human experience?3 When Warren Hastings suggested that the BG compared favorably to the Bible in his remarks introducing the Wilkins translation, he was strongly chided in the review journals for ballyhooing the public.4 Now, two hundred years later, the BG is studied as literature, as philosophy, and as scripture. In this age of relativistic cultural studies, its status in world literature is recognized and respected. None of the studies reviewed in this article adopts so simple a reductivist analysis as to see in the BG's contents only a devotional religious sentiment, nor do these studies contain explanations of theological issues alone. Each area of study, literary, philosophical, religious, creates its own boundaries, recognizes its own relevant facts and adopts its own interpretive bias in sorting out the significant from the extraneous. After two centuries of continued western study attempting to comprehend the BG and the continual appreciation for the BG, little consensus has been reached among scholars. There are great differences of opinion among contemporary BG scholars on issues central to any understanding of the BG. Past trends and scholars' recent research efforts will be considered in this review of directions in BG studies. Three Recent Bibliographical Studies. Bhagavadgítãnuvãda: A Study in Transcultural Translation by Winland M. Callewaert and 20</page><page sequence="2">Shilanand Hemraj. Ranchi: Satya Bharati Publications, 1982. Bhagavad-Gitã ': An International Bibliography of 1 785-1979 Imprints by Jagdish Chander Kapoor; with an introduction by George Hendrick. New York: Garland Publishing, Inc., 1983. Bhagavad Gita Reference Guide: Bhagavad Gita Rendered in the Languages of the World by Ram Dular Singh. Calcutta: Bibliographical Society of India, 1984. The publication of three bibliographies on BG scholarship offers an excellent opportunity for an appraisal of historical trends in BG studies. These bibliographies follow three different methods of organizing historical information. Each bibliography contributes a very different version of the scholarship surrounding the BG, of people's formal attempts to understand the BG. Entries overlap between the three bibliographies and give the researcher convenient points of reference in the presentation pursued by the individual bibliographer. Where a single bibliography presents helpful reference information, the appearance of three independently prepared bibliographies places BG studies on a solid foundation, organizing a good portion of the previous scholarly work and making this work more readily accessible. Callewaert and Hemraj have produced the most comprehensive bibliography by sheer quantity of entries. There is an extensive introductory essay stressing the similarities between the Bible and the BG as source texts for translation. This initial essay contains an excellent summary of virtually all of the textual, not interpretive, themes in the western study of the BG. The themes are handled quite tersely and with a detailed sophistication capable of losing newcomers to the subject. The first bibliographical list chronologically traces the modern movement to develop a "critical" text from Colebrook's 1808-9 text printed in Devanagari script through S. K. Belvalkar's "Authorized Version" according to Sãnkarabhãsya, compiled at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona (1941). All of the seventy-five languages for which there are bibliographies are alphabetically arranged. Short statements precede many bibliographies outlining the major publications in the history of BG scholarship for the specific language. While there are advantages to the comprehensiveness of this bibliography, the alphabetical format yields mere lists. The reader receives no sense of the life histories of the individual books in these lists, and while the introductory remarks provide some guidance, the accumulation of knowledge within language boundaries is incomprehensible for the longer bibliographies. Kapoor selected entries for his bibliography with an eye toward accessibility. He includes location symbols for the texts in his bibliographical lists, which reference hundreds of libraries (principally in North America). The organization of the bibliography for each language is chronological and provides the reader with a historical dimension missing in Callewaert and Hemraj. Kapoor begins with Wilkins' 1785 translation in his bibliography of English translations and proceeds by yearly increments up to 1979. His listings include multiple references for books according to the year in which subsequent editions were published. For example, the persistent reader discovers that the original Wilkins translation was reprinted in 1959 and 1976, or that Sir Edwin Arnold's 1885 translation underwent many editions and reprintings in the ensuing years. Kapoor's bibliography causes the reader to think historically about the accumulation of knowledge concerning the BG within language boundaries and provides a nice complement to the Callewaert and Hemraj volume. 21</page><page sequence="3">Finally, Ram Dular Singh of the National Library, Calcutta, advertises his contribution to BG studies as a "reference guide." While almost as comprehensive as the two bibliographies cited above, the unique organization of this bibliography yields a further contribution to BG studies. The alphabetically organized bibliography for each language includes translations and commentaries. In addition, Singh provides multiple listings under the author entry; i.e., the reader first encounters thirteen entries for "Arnold, Edwin." While this is not an all-inclusive list for the reprints and editions of The Song Celestial,5 the text provides the reader with a feel for the historical significance of prominent translations. This bibliography yields yet another version of the history of BG studies. After the bibliographies of translations and commentaries for each language, Singh provides bibliographies of critical studies. This is the greatest contribution of this bibliography for scholarly research. Callewaert and Hemraj include an extensive "Supplementary Bibliography" of critical studies; the hundreds of listings principally reference English books and journal articles. The list has only a smattering of critical studies in other languages, and the non-English language studies are difficult to identify in transliterated form. The researcher must read through forty pages of small print with little to show for such an effort. On the other hand, Kapoor's bibliography references books and concentrates on translations. This concentration is particularly apparent in the Indian languages, where we also note that Kapoor's historical format is less reliable and occasionally contradicted by Singh (e.g., Ram KesavRanade, JnãneÉvari Prosody Marathi critical study in Singh 1964 and in Kapoor 1970). Singh also provides more location symbols for the Indian texts, the result of having worked in India rather than in the West. The table of abbreviations for location symbols was not included in the book and are included below, thanks to the kind cooperation of Dr. Singh.* For scholars interested in the tradition of BG studies in the Indian languages, Singh's "Reference Guide" is the place to begin. The translation, commentaries, and critical studies listed in these bibliographies reveal an almost universal attempt by scholars to interpret the BG's meaning. Scholars have failed to cross the barrier separating the textual and the contextual.6 Gandhi, Tilak, Aurobindo, and other modern political/spiritual figures brought the BG forcefully into the public domain. Scholars have shown interest in the unique ideological facets of their interpretations, but they often ignore the sociological implications and public understandings produced through the BG. This is true of the earlier Indian commentaries as well. Shankara, Ramanuja, et al , are conceived/perceived with modern philological attitudes to be revealing the meaning of the BG. Little notice is taken of the developments in religious practices between the text's birth (ca. 200 B.C.) and the major commentators; little notice of the emergence of the temple as a place of worship and center of Hindu religious practice; AS = Asiatic Society, Calcutta Β Η U = Benares Hindu University Β Μ = British Museum, London G Ρ = Gita Press, Gorakhpur 10 = India Office, London IT = Index Translationum, Paris Κ V Ρ = Kashi Vidyapith, Varanasi L C = Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. Ν L = National Library, Calcutta Ν Υ Ρ L = New York Public Library, New York SB = Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, Varanasi 22</page><page sequence="4">and little notice of how the commentators as philosophical system makers revalorized the BG within specific historical circumstances. Commentators present their interpretive ideas, but modern scholars have yet to speculate on the importance of those ideas within an historical setting. Modern philosophers troubled by the claims of science are continually struggling with questions concerning the relevance of philosophy. Indian philosophers were system makers precisely to surmount the problem of philsophical obscurity, to bridge the gap between text and context, between a theory full of ideas and ideas people could use to live by in the world. Still, the problem of philosophical relevance has yet to be projected onto the Indian philosophers who interpreted the BG as a text expressing a philosophical position. This area of investigation remains fertile ground for scholarly attention and conjecture, conjecture which will inevitably lead to the refinement of speculation and tentative understandings regarding the BG's influential role in Indian religious and cultural history. The Rudolphs discuss the dialectic nature of the concepts 'tradition' and 'modernity' to show how these concepts can organize an axiological continuum of historical developments within Indian civilization. They recount examples in which traditional cultural ideas were incorporated into, yet adjusted for, new historical situations.7 The same should certainly be possible and attempted in spite of the sparse sociological data for commentators such as Shankara and Ramanuja and their commentaries on the BG. We can say with conviction that while very little is known about the BG in modern local communities, even less is known about the historical relationships between the Indian masses and the BG, and while caution must be exercised in relating the present to the past, anthropological studies of the BG may produce potential insights into its past relevance. Additionally, the BG's significance within the western understanding of the religious and literary traditions, which cognitively construct Indian culture, remains equally obscure. The English sections of these bibliographies chronicle the overwhelming concern to interpret the meaning of the BG with no indications of any interest for understanding western interpretations within the context of western thought. Perhaps disciplinary history is of little interest to textualists, but as one of the most prominent texts in the western interpretation of things Indian, scholars could only benefit from the historian's research into the interpretive trends and biases in BG scholarship. Sheldon Pollock's recent article on the relation between theory and practice is quite instructive in regard to the lack of concern for the context of the BG in both the eastern and western intellectual traditions. Pollock observes that "sãstra had initially a thoroughly descriptive character."8 But a semantic shift in the meaning of sastra occurs which represents a development toward normative discourse that comes only over time. This shift in the idea of sastra, from "texts initially shaped to reality becoming texts with the authority to shape reality to themselves,"9 parallels the relationship between the BG and its commentators, especially on the Indian side. On the western side the confusion between text and commentary is nowhere more pronounced than in translation work. Even western comparative philosophy has concentrated more on the philosophies of the BG's commentators than on the philosophical arguments of the BG itself. This emphasis is both the focus of past studies and an encouragement for future studies which build upon previous work. The tendency of western scholars to view the BG as a normative rather than a descriptive text allows scholars to encapsulate the BG within itself and encourages them to attempt to make the text appear rationally consistent and logically coherent. While the western emphasis on the normative evaluation of the BG will be apparent in the two 23</page><page sequence="5">remaining sections of this paper on critical studies and translation work, some suggestions about how the BG can be valued as a descriptive text will be offered. The three bibliographies which gave rise to this tangential discussion on what is generally lacking in current research efforts regarding the BG reveal the extensive influence of the BG in the East and the West, and open up the immensity of BG scholarship to broader issues in present-day intellectual traditions. While we know of the religious importance of the BG in the modern estimation, its more subtle influences on modern thought have yet to be explored. Among their conclusions, Callewaert and Hemraj suggest: As translations of the Gîta give matter for a good case-study in transcultural translation, an exhaustive list of translations in all languages can be used for research in two directions: one, a comparison of translations (Indian and non- Indian) at a particular moment (e.g. 1900), with special attention given to inter-relationships; two, a study of translations into one particular language, whereby the scholar focuses his attention on the linguistic development of a language, using verses of the Gîta as samples, (p. 83) To the inventive mind these three extensive and helpful bibliographies can be a starting place for much more. Critical Studies in BG Research. The Hindu GTtã: Ancient and Classical Interpretations of the BhagavadgTtã by Arvind Sharma. LaSalle, IL: Open Court Publishing Co., 1986. The Universal Gîta: Western Images of the Bhagavad Gîta: A Bicentary Survey by Erick J. Sharpe. LaSalle, IL: Open Court Publishing Co., 1985. Bhagavad-GTtd: An Exegetical Commentary by Robert N. Minor. New Delhi: Heritage Publishers, 1982. The story of the BG in the Indian tradition covers two millenia, a span of time filled with attentive commentators who set out to critically interpret the text. From the beginning of western BG studies translators have consulted and relied upon Indian commentarial analysis in their search to understand the BG and uncover a means to record the BG in a guest language. It was suggested above that translators have relied upon various commentators without explaining the relationship between text and commentary. The relationship between the historical moment of the commentator and the text is rarely considered in translation work, which quickly appropriates philosophical ideas without any esthetic sense of their practical relevance within the commentarial exegesis. The reliance on commentaries to interpret selected verses which prove troublesome for the translator invites misrepresentation. Before ideas can be plucked out of commentaries and used by translators, the commentaries must be fully understood so that the import of the commentarial interpretation can be grasped. Since commentaries are so important for the western knowledge of the BG, the critical study of commentarial interpretations continues to occupy the attention of scholars. Arvind Sharma' s book is a pleasant departure from the usual format of commentarial studies. Sharma's respect for the text of the BG is exceptional. He is not content in his survey of the principal Vedanta commentators to produce chapters which just describe the 24</page><page sequence="6">BG according to Shankara, Ramanuja, or Madhva. Sharma does not pretend to a comprehensive study of their entire commentaries or to a comprehensive comparison of their philosophical systems. Rather, he focuses on specific concepts such as Shankara' s reliance on samnyãsa (renunciation of action) in his commentary, or Ramanuja' s reliance on tyãga (renunciation of the fruits which accrue from action); a contrast discoursed upon on Chapter 18 of the BG. In addition, Sharma deals most exhaustively with Madhva, a commentator much less known to western audiences. Sharma is not content to let the commentators take too great liberties with the original text and faults them for specific interpretive excesses. On first reading, this approach seemed an over-indulgence on Sharma' s part because he had failed to explain the values he used to evaluate the commentarial exegesis. Further attention to the material suggested that Sharma was producing some cogent insights into these commentaries and some potentially stimulating material for historians and sociologists of religion. Sharma stands as umpire officiating a match between BG and commentator, between text and interpreter, noting both successes and failures on the commentators' part, while all the while discoursing on the text of the BG. We can as audience, however, fault Sharma the umpire for a book title which is only partially accurate. There are a few chapters on the "Hindu" BG, i.e.,appelations toward the BG in epic and puranic literature, suggesting that the Indian cultural tradition has historically held the BG in very high esteem even before any commentators expounded upon it. He also briefly discusses the troublesome position of the commentator Bhaskara. But these initial chapters are too short, and Sharma never adequately integrates them with the bulk of a book he might have more accurately titled The Vedãntic Gitã. Sharma has failed to even mention, let alone discuss, the Sanskritic commentaries of the Kashmir Shaivite school, which includes the eminent philosopher Abhinavagupta. He refers to the well-known Marathi commentary of Jnanesvar only once, in his preface, in order to formally place it beyond his scope. But the misnomer in the title is not completely out of line in western BG studies; it points instead to a common conceptual faux pas in Indian studies. The great Vedantic commentator Shankara exercises an almost pervasive influence on scholarly analysis of the BG with Ramanuja a very distant second. In spite of the western reliance on Vedantic commentaries, we must attempt to avoid servicing the often-unconscious scholarly equations 'Hinduism equals Vedanta' and/or 'Hinduism equals Sanskrit.' One of the ways these mistaken identities can be avoided in BG studies is through a critical study of the text itself rather than through its commentators. A critical study of the text would attempt to interpret the BG within its original cultural moment.10 In order to appreciate the commentaries on the BG we must recognize their position within their respective historical moments.11 At present, scholars have made only meagre beginnings towards a critical analysis of the BG. Sharma has shown through his analysis of commentators what is equally possible and unquestionably desirable for the BG, a study of its use of words and their meanings within their specific textual contexts. Present word studies too often involve excursions into upanishadic and late Vedic Sanskritic materials for the sense of their semantic range.12 Belvalkar's critical edition provides adequate boundaries for the BG, and knowledge of the text would advance greatly if some scholar would comply witht the limits of the text and analyze the entire critical text before extending his or her study into the adjacent literature. Still, we can amend an old saying and suggest that one should not judge a book by the title on its cover, even if it is an enticing title. Inside the cover we find an interesting study which demonstrates that the Indian commentators had their own interpretive agendas and that their commentarial analysis attempted to fulfill those specific interpretive agendas. 25</page><page sequence="7">We must be willing to reject the impression received from various translators' remarks and accept that these commentaries were not conceived as explanatory exercises for the assistance of modern translators and commentators, but rather exist within real historical situations. Sharma's book, whatever its faults, constitutes a critical study of three commentators' treatment of the BG and exemplifies how the BG itself could be critically studied through an analysis of its use of key concepts. While Sharma has produced a book about the BG in the context of a limited section of the Indian commentarial tradition, his former colleague in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Sydney, Eric Sharpe, has written a book which treats the reception of the BG in modern times and internationally. The two books complement each other. The BG through the ages and the BG in modern history, the BG in the Orient and the BG primarily in the Occident. Sharma has evaluated the text and indigenous textual exegesis (again, without developing the sense of what the commentator perceived as the purpose of his commentary) while Sharpe has evaluated the modern contextualization of the BG in western thought and suggested its importance to prominent individuals within the Indian nationalist movement. Sharpe chronicles the modern evaluations of the BG as a religious text, as the Indian book often times referred to in the West as the "Hindu Bible." The book is a historical account of the process which transformed the BG from a curious specimen of Indian thought into a well-respected religious work in modern intellectual circles. When westerners evaluate the BG as scripture, as addressing issues faced by men and women through all times and in all places, and as a text amenable to continually revised interpretations and translations, then the title adjective "universal" appears a good one. The episodic account of the BG outside of its specific Indian cultural confines marks a necessary first step in the study of the influence exercised by foreign texts on the conception of religion, of religious ideas and truths, and of people's understanding of the world among western intellectuals. Sharpe begins his introduction with an explanation concerning the availability of scripture outside of its initial cultural domain. "Once they have been printed in large numbers no one can prevent them from being read by those for whom they were not initially intended" (p.xi). The phenomenon, "free interchange of scriptures," he remarks, "is a problem belonging to the post-Enlightenment world" (p.xi). Next to the Bible, and more specifically the New Testament, the BG is the most translated scriptural text. The wide circulation of the BG makes it an excellent choice for a modern intellectual and comparative study of scripture. Curiously, one of the most relevant episodes in the historical story that Sharpe commences to tell is absent. He fails to mention the critical edition of the text prepared by Belvalkar. Why this scholarly venture has been overlooked cannot be explained, but as Callewaert and Hemraj have shown, the preparation of a critical edition is a task wrought with religious significance for the western study of scripture. In one sense Sharpe could have titled his book The Western Gîta. His history of the BG, even of its rise to political prominence in the Indian nationalist movement, is written from the point of view of western influence, suggesting that Indian thinkers adopted the BG because the West was familiar with it. Sharpe' s history suffers from the general lack of scholarly attention paid to the BG as a sociologically significant document, or perhaps the lack of social significance the BG held for Indians prior to the rise of Indian political associations in the nineteenth century. In addition, however adequate or inadequate, appealing or unsuccessful Indian scholarship on the BG appears to western scholars, 26</page><page sequence="8">significant advances in BG scholarship have not been confined to America and Europe, a potential impression a reader of Sharpens history may receive.13 The predominance of a particular style of discourse in the West suggesting a community of researchers should not itself constitute a basis for the exclusion of other scholarly communities. There is more than theosophical speculation and allegorical interpretation to be found among modern Indian BG researchers: Sharpe's view of the BG's role in modern history is not quite as "universal" as it might have been. The reader finds little in the way of analysis concerning the western scholar's interpretations of the BG. There is little concerning the major issues in religious thought and practice relevant to those scholars and incorporated by them into their work on the BG. Sharpe's book is an introductory survey of the BG's character over two centuries from Wilkins through A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's Bhagavad-GTtd As It Is (1968). It is a brief sojourn into an area laden with material, a history which fails to inform the reader that much of the change of opinion regarding the BG had little to do with gaining a better understanding of the BG, involving instead externalist influences in the intellectual community to which the BG was a scrutinized guest. Much of the western scholarly effort appears as an attempt to properly seat the BG at the table of religious/ scriptural studies. It is not so much an appreciation of the BG which has changed over time; rather, it has been the questions and methods brought to the BG which have catalyzed various interpretations. Western scholarship has become increasingly aware of dominance relationships in cross-cultural studies. Relations East and West have been examined in the literary- psychological construction of self by Edward Said,14 and in western Indological scholarship by Halbfass,15 by Trautmann,16 and by the Rudolphs.17 Up until the rise of area-studies programs following World War II, scholars pursued the analysis of cross-cultural characterizations on levels of incredible generality. National character studies offered nothing more than racial stereotypes within which thought patterns were reified and came to represent the personalities of population groups. Individuals were totally subsumed by this method of study. The interwar period was dominated by the philosophical opinion which portrayed the West as materialist and the East as spiritual, while all the while overlooking India as one of England's greatest sources of wealth. One can clearly perceive an emphasis on national developmental themes in the representation of cultural idioms symbolic of the individual following the interwar period.18 Sharpe uncritically describes how discourses on religion approached and responded to eastern spirituality epitomized by the position of the BG relative to an English reading audience: At one extreme, alienation from the values of Western culture and religion resulted in an emotional desire always to give the East preferential treatment in matters involving the spiritual life. For many years practically monopolised in the West by the Theosophical Society and its various offshoots, since the 1960s this tendency has settled down to become an omnipresent feature of 'alternative spirituality', where the reading of the Gita, and the production of commentaries and superficially edifying discourses on the oneness of all truth, became extremely common. At the other extreme the East and Eastern forms of religion posed too much of a threat to conservative and conventional Christianity to be regarded other than with alarm. One might have expected that even here, the very magnitude of the threat would have inspired a certain desire to come to grips with its presuppositions and its source material. This, however, hardly happened-though for reasons too complex to discuss further on this occasion. 27</page><page sequence="9">In between these two extremes, however, there was an indistinct ground occupied by various types of liberals-in Christian terms, still loyal to their churches and the traditions they represented, but increasingly prepared to undertake voyages of exploration into foreign territorial waters. Here too the reading of the Gita assumed a certain importance, after the 1960s under the rubric of 'inter-religious dialogue.' (p. 150) Sharpens history tells a story of dominance, a story of the Christian valuation of the BG over a two-hundred-year period: his characterization is certainly appropriate, but it is the product of selected relevant materials. While an introduction to any subject can never supplant an in-depth study, nor does Sharpe suggest that his book is other than introductory, the reader is never informed of any other possible interpretations. If even casually informed of the selection process and what has not been attempted, the reader would be far less likely to mistake a part of the story for the whole. With respect to Sharpe' s limited outlook on the development of religious ideas and values in the West and their influence on BG studies, one notably objectionable idea has crept into his historical account. Sharpe suggests that the concept of mysticism carried only negative connotations for a nineteenth-century English-reading audience, especially Christians of evangelical persuasion (pp. 40-41). Sharpe continues, in German the word Mystik carried legitimate, positive religious value in contrast to the word Mystizismus, which conveyed a negative value congruent with the English word "mysticism." This was a source of trouble for readers of books translated from German into English. However, Sharpe' s argument fora single English meaning of the word "mysticism" is directly contradicted by the Oxford English Dictionary, which provides primary definitions carrying a positive value under the headings "mystic"and "mysticism, "and includes references to sources considerably earlier than Sharpe suggests.19 Furthermore, it is an idea thoroughly contradicted by Louis Martz's excellent study of seventeenth-century English poetry in which mystical experiences are achieved through meditative and contemplative practices and are hailed as humans' greatest spiritual accomplishment.20 Even if we could accept a predominantly pejorative sense in popular parlance for the English concept of mysticism, the distinction between the German Mystik and Mystizismus could be found in the arguments concerning the value of reason and faith which ensued between the Gnostics and the Catholic Church over the last fifteen hundred years or more. Contrary to Sharpe's contention, English-language discourse did address something of the phenomenon of a transcendental nature under the rubric of the term mysticism, and not always in a derogatory fashion. Still, it would be inaccurate to advance an argument concerning the positive appraisal of most Indian religious ideas among mid- and late- nineteenth-century Christians. Ideas concerning intelligence were conflated with race,21 ideas of cultural sophistication with progress and (social) evolutionary schemes,22 and ideas of human potential with a utilitarian rationalism beyond the reach of those without an English education.23 English-language journals reflect a dismissal of the mystical religious experiences described by the natives of the colonies because they possessed inadequate psychological development. Eastern religion in the mid-nineteenth century was characterized as fostering a pessimistic world view which could never lead to acceptable moral and ethical standards among the populace. This opinion, however, involves another issue beyond the bounds of our present concerns. Sharpe's characterization of the twentieth- century western treatment of the BG quoted above applies to the nineteenth century, too. Even then the BG was occasionally accepted on an intellectual basis by those who were sympathetic and wholly accepted by those of a more liberal persuasion; but more often it was either denigrated or ignored. Sharpe's argument about the meaning of myticism could 28</page><page sequence="10">be accepted if by it we are to understand that the western intellectual tradition denigrated non-western mystical doctrines. But as it is stated by Sharpe, the argument appears a misrepresentation . Issues of intelligence, race, religious sophistication and evolution, and other more contemporary historical themes have yet to be carefully considered in the history of the indological discipline and as influencing critical studies of and translation strategies developed for the BG; "... the writing of history is itself a process of history,"24 and Sharpe' s history points toward the immensely important role of the BG in comparative religious studies. The book is strongest in presenting details in the western study of a text which came to be treated as the principal scripture of Hinduism. It is weakest in evaluating the role of the BG in the development of conceptual values for religious studies among social scientists, humanists, and specifically, Indologists. Sharpe has provided interesting accounts of some prominent BG exegetes. He has informed us of what these exegetes wrote and left us to wonder how what they came to understand of the BG was shaped by what they already knew. Sharpe has focused on their internal dialogues. He presents a description rather than an interpretation of their scholarly effort. There is still a great deal of work to do before the external influence shaping the thought and presentation of these scholars is brought into the historical tale. The first step in writing a history of western BG studies has been taken; the thousand-mile journey remains. Robert Minor has produced an interesting book which sets out to present the message of the BG as Indian commentators and western interpreters have understood it. Minor's work reveals the true complexity of the BG and the absolute impossibility for any translator to steer a middle course and reconcile the diversity of opinions about the meaning of the BG on a verse-by-verse basis. Unfortunately Minor has also gotten lost in the voluminous explanatory statements regarding the meaning of the individual verses comprising the BG. His exegetical commentary neither places the text into an identifiable historical moment nor represents any of the commentarial or scholarly analysis systematically enough to allow the reader to piece together such moments. Minor's exegesis is too piecemeal, but in spite of this typical oversight he makes some interesting observations. His commentary is a selection of analytical opinions on every verse of the BG and as such could be consulted by the interested student. But the exercise of caution is encouraged as the reliability of some of the information provided by Minor has been called into question.25 The format of the presentation is not conducive to a sit-down read. Minor's introductory essay reviews the major themes surrounding the BG for western scholars. He is not as thorough nor as technical as Callewaert and Hemraj, which makes this introduction suitable for the novice. However, Minor's quest for simplicity has enabled potential inaccuracies to creep into the essay, and these exceptions must be noted. We begin with Minor's interpretation ofRamanuja's Visistãdvaita philosophy. Minor writes of Ramanuja, "... he believed that the Gîta taught that the true self is not Divine and not one with other selves, though in liberation it is identical in knowledge to those other selves" (p.xvii). Minor could have more correctly characterized Ramanuja's conceptualization of the relation between humans and deity if he would have stated that 'the self is not identical with the Divine," as in Advaita philosophy. To contend that the self is not divine for Ramanuja directly contradicts Ramanuja's formulation of the concepts Éanrasarfribhwa (a theory about the relationship between the subject and object),26 and dharmabhütaßana(2i concept signifying the perfect subject).27 John Carman's study of Ramanuja also speaks directly to this issue. He finds in the Gitãbhãsya (Ramanuja's commentary on the BG) that "all entities, both material and spiritual, all the way from the 29</page><page sequence="11">cosmic fashioner Brahma to a blade of grass, originate from the two natures of God and are thus of God" (p. 154, note32). Ramanuja's philosophy accounts for distinct relations of identity between humans and the divine. Particular relations of identity described by Ramanuja must be understood through the manner in which humans worship the divine. "The unity herein brought into existence between the Divine and the human is of the essence of religious consciousness. . . ,"28 In the Gitabhasya Ramanuja must account for Arjuna's religious experience of the supreme Divine in Chapter 11. About Arjuna's experience Ramanuja acknowledges that it is an unusual and unique experience acknowledges that it is an unusual and unique experience of Parabrahma, who is none other than Narayana (Gitabhasya XI.9). Minor's treatment of Ramanuja's theism reveals how the interpretations of commentators are valued as mere philosophical constructions devoid of epistemological value. Minor remarks that "The Supreme is the god Visnu, the only true god, and liberation is attained by devotion and service to Him" (p.xviii). To call the Supreme "Vi§nu" seems correct. Carman states that Vishnu is synonymous with Narayana (p. 158, note 32). But Narayana is the supreme divinity for Ramanuja; it is Narayana as distinct from Vishnu who is the absolute divine. There is a great difference in the significance of these deities in the textual tradition to which Ramanuja appeals as the source of authority. The difference between Narayana and Vishnu, which collapses in many western studies, is never so simply treated among Indian scholars, who do not treat these two names as synonyms. Here, I suggest that these two names reference different theological dimensions in Ramanuja's description of the nature of god. H. Daniel Smith's study of Vaishnava iconography classifies Narayana as a mwm'-form, one of the invisible powers of protection. Vishnu in his avatara forms, on the other hand, is a visible, terrestrial deity. Smith also explains the difference between the Para forms of the One Lord and the Apara, or terrestial, forms of god.29 While the Vaishnava canon classifies Narayana as a murti-form, Ramanuja, adopting Pancaratra doctrine, considers Narayana the pre-eminent Para form. This aspect of Sri Vaishava theology is obscured by considering the names Narayana and Vishnu as synonymous. Of course, both names are used by Ramanuja in his commentaries and may at certain junctures appear synonymous, but this mistaken notion results simply because the historical distance between the text and the commentary is too often obviated in western studies. We should not ignore the potential significance of these names as naming distinct aspects of god in Ramanuja's thought. Considering the complexity of Sri Vaishnava theology, we should at least pay heed to the potential multi-referentiality of the distinct epithets used by Ramanuja and entertain the idea that the various names of god suggest very specific things about god, and hence about humans' relation to god. If we substitute the word "god" for the word "Brahman," then Arvind Sharma's observations on Ramanuja from an earlier book are very telling: The basic question which Ramanja faced was the same as Hindu thinkers have faced before him and after: (1) What is the nature of Brahman? It is ultimately nirguna or sagunal; (2) How is Brahman related to the world and its creatures? Are they a part of Brahman? and (3) How is Brahman to be realized in order that salvation be achieved?30 In attempting to understand Ramanuja's philosophy, or any commentarial position, we must avoid eliminating meaningful details. The importance of the names Narayana and Vishnu for Ramanuja is a single example of a much larger issue in cross-cultural studies. 30</page><page sequence="12">Multiple names for deities are interpreted (or ignored) according to two strategies as suggested by A. K. Chakravorty.31 The Indian tradition sees in names specific details about the nature of a god, the diversity of names corresponding to the diverse nature of the god. The western scholarly tradition has developed a theory of syncretism, which is also propounded by some Indian scholars. The syncretistic theory attempts to account for the ideological shift from pantheism to monotheism, the evolution in thought from distinct names for many individual gods to the attribution of many names to a single god. It is a theory steeped in the social evolutionary theories of human development, which seeks to rationalize the pre-eminent accomplishment of monotheistic religion. The development of syncretistic theory to explain the changing Indian conceptualization of divinity was a popular one, almost a truism in the western analysis of Sanskritic literature. The BG was often set up as the fulcrum for this conceptual shift; the many epithets used in the BG were believed to identify either Krishna or Vishnu as the Supreme. The theory of syncretism made it easier for some westerners to respect the BG as scripture, as containing thoughts almost as lofty as the monotheism of the King James Bible. But the syncretistic interpretation, popular as its principal corallary has become, is intellectually corrupt. It can be observed in the confusion over the nature of the deities Narayana and Vishnu in Ramanuja's philosophical system and their respective importance within the Sri Vaishnava tradition. Further discussion about the importance of names will continue in the section on translation. Finally, I would like to embellish one other statement from Minor's introductory essay involving his characterization of K. T. Telang, who translated the BG for Max Miiller's Sacred BooL· of the East series (Vol. 8, 1882). Minor brings Telang into his discussion concerning the relation of the BG to the Mahãbhãrata. Telang does indeed, as Minor says, argue for the genuineness of the BG's position withing the longer epic. But Telang is not as committed as Minor's portrayal might indicate. As Telang writes, "I am prepared to adhere, I will not say without diffidence, to the theory of the genuineness of the Bhagavadgîtâ as a portion of the original Mahãbhãrata."32 We must be even more careful not to confuse Telang' s argument with the recent arguments by J. A. B. van Buitenen's student Jim Fitzgerald.33 While Telang argues that the BG was written along with the core of the epic, that it belongs to the earliest strata of the epic, he does not, as seems to be the intent of scholars over the last twenty odd years, mean to suggest that the BG was written along with the epic, but rather that the BG- whatever its origins- was part of the earliest strata in the epic's development. This may seem like hair splitting but it is really far more significant, for there is a historical inaccuracy involved here. Telang' s arugment about the contents of the BG addresses the BG's theological qualities. The theological nature of the BG's contents dominated virtually all facets of its study in the late nineteenth century. Theological arguments were prédominent in the social, scientific, and humanistic interpretations of "religions" in the societies of the world. Both the scholarly study of the text and the western understanding of the BG in the Indian tradition were couched in theological terms. Telang wrote to discourage any misconceptions about the unitive nature of the BG's theological arguments, to refute the misconception that the BGs presents a normative rather than descriptive discourse on theological questions. Telang dates the BG to a time much earlier than the age of Sanskritic systematic philosophy. Dating the text was a problem during Telang' s time, devolving upon claims that the Sãmkhya kãrikã of Ishvarakrishna, who expounded upon Kapila's thought, was prior to the BG.34 The relationship between the dates of these two texts was at the time reversed from what has later come to be generally accepted. Telang sought to resolve this misunderstanding in his introduction by suggesting that no rationally organized sütra philosophy predated the sãmkhya philosophy encountered in the BG. 31</page><page sequence="13">Telang's date of no later than the second century B.C. for the BG placed it within the upanishadic constellation. About the BG's upanishadic-like contents, Telang wrote, "... the philosophical part has not been consistently and fully worked out. We have there the results of free thought, exercised on different subjects of great moment, unfettered by the exigencies of any foregone conclusions, or any full developed theory" (p.7, note 41). Telang's characterization of the BG's contents has been ignored this past century; no scholar has yet to assume the unity of the text without equally presuming the unity of its message. Telang's suggestion is pushed even further aside by the latest interpretive approach, which seeks a unity of the BG message relative to the story told in the Mahãbhãrata. Telang's inaudible cry should be given new voice if only to counterbalance one hundred years of interpretive scholarship which sought and still seeks to stress the unitive nature of the BG argument and the theological essence of that argument. Both assumptions are incorporated into the interpretive strategies of most (one cannot say all) translators. There is a dearth of modern scholars ready to approach the text as a series of arguments, as a collection of variously directed explanations on a number of subjects, and as containing a number of points of view on any given subject depending upon its situation within a particular argument. Too often the BG is picked at by scholars as a carcass by vultures. Verses are torn out of this chapter and that chapter, placed alongside of each other, and compared or contrasted. A sensitivity for the rhetorical qualities of the dialogue has been largely invisible in the analysis of the BG's contents. Arguments regarding the unity of the text and its theological import become transparent in the translation of the various epithets used throughout the dialogue which is recounted in the BG. In the next section on translation we will first consider the interpretive strategies of translators, then their treatment of epithets, and finally how these strategies affect their interpretation of the nature of religious consciousness propounded by the BG. Translating the BG into English Bhagavad Gîta, trans, and commentary by Richard Gotshalk. New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1985. The Bhagavad-GTtd: Yoga of Contemplation and Action, trans. Georg Feuerstein. New Delhi: Arnold-Heinemann, 1980. The BhagavadgJtã: A New Translation, by Kees Bolle. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1979. The BhagavadgTtã in the Mahãbhãrata: Text and Translation by J. A. B. van Buitenen. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1981. Translators now readily share with the reader the realization that translation requires interpretation. A text cannot be objectively rendered by even the most insightful and meticulous translator because no language is perfectly expressed by another language. The translation of the BG into a guest language from the host language of Sanskrit is believed to be greatly aided by consulting Sanskrit commentators who provide a 'native' or culturally specific interpretation. The job of translating the BG, even with the guidance of a commentary, is a difficult one, and a translator's success varies in quality even within the 32</page><page sequence="14">same translation. Variability makes the job of judging translations a difficult one, unless a translation is clearly a horrendous distortion of the original text. None of the translations considered here are consistently poor, although a section from one translation may read better than a section from one of the other translations. I could only appear arrogant in attempting to review four translations simultaneously. To ease the burdensome weight of recent scholarly translations, I will venture to compare only selected aspects of these translations. A theme constantly attended to throughout the two centuries of BG translations involves the method of interpretation. Van Buitenen's remarks about fixed-equivalent translation strategy expresses a concern for words, for the varied meanings of single words and the problems of distortion which occur to the translated text when parallel vocabularies break down between the host and guest languages.35 Consistency in translating words from the host language with fixed equivalents in the guest language indicates a translator's felt sensitivity to represent the text as accurately as possible to the reader of the translation. Even more problematic than the lack of consistent parallels between languages for fixed- equivalent word translation strategy are those concepts, from a specific language and in a specific text, for which another language can only venture to provide an approximation. A translator may fight through the morass of words, their meanings, and their relationships with other words which further affect meanings to provide a translation built upon philological analysis and textual specificity, and still reach a dead-end in translating certain words and phrases. Feuerstein has adopted the fixed-equivalent translation strategy for his recent translation. Van Buitenen expressed a need to abandon the fixed-equivalent translation strategy in working on the BG. He rejected this strategy, acknowledging the BG to be one of "the more technically philosophical portions" of the epic (p. xli:,note 45). The other side of the interpretive issue begins with meanings, with the intent of language rather than with specific lexical items. Callewaert and Hemraj label this style of translation 'dynamic-equivalence' and advocate this strategy as a means of maintaining a scripture's modern appearance and relevance. Dynamic-equivalence translation strategy seeks to transpose the meanings expressed in the text in its host language into equivalent statements of meaning in the guest language. Kees Bolle adopts this interpretive translation strategy. He also advocates the translation of "crucial words" often left untranslated. "It is certainly no longer necessary to deal with the Gîta only as a simple exercise in grammar and vocabulary" (p. 227). Bolle also recognizes that this strategy has led to serious abuses in the tradition of BG translations: W. Douglas P. Hill, who in 1928 gave us the most outstanding English rendering of the text, was quite conscious of the difference between good and bad translations. He noted in his "Bibliographical Notes" that in the eighteen eighties and nineties the BhagavadgTtä had become "the playground of western pseudo-mystics." He did not appreciate the attempts that he grouped together as "Theosophical Versions"; he referred to the greater part of other works on the Gîta as "comparatively worthless, "and he added: "Hundreds of vernacular editions have found a home in the Indian Office Library, and still continue to encumber its reluctant shelves, (pp. 224-25)36 Somewhere between the host and guest languages, and between the admixture of meanings and words throughout its 700 verses and eighteen chapters, and between the translator's 33</page><page sequence="15">understandings and interpretations of the BG, good translations and bad translations arise. Minor does not provide a translation along with his exegetical remarks, but his text indicates the complexity of the BG as a text for translation. Translation is a somewhat ambiguous task. The translator outlines particular rules of interpretation and the boundaries within which those rules apply to the translation at hand. The translator's interpretive strategy explains to the reader a particular vantage point from which the text was viewed by the translator and presented to the reader. The interpretive strategy suggests to the reader how the translation is to be understood. A cycle is constructed between the interpretive position of the translator, the reader, and the translation qua interpretation. Ambiguity creeps into the process of evaluating words and meanings and their significance within the text, and nowhere is this problem more apparent than in the translation of epithets. There is no reason to believe that the variety of epithets employed in the BG occurs merely to satisfy the metrical requirements of poetic versification, or is, quite simply, the result of interpolations.37 The importance of names is known in literary genres proceeding the epic: If a name is intimately associated with its owner and constitutes part of his personality it may not only express his nature, character and achievement but on the other hand also be a sort of 'regulative principle' casting its bearer in a definite mould and forcing him so to say to conform to the ideal qualities expressed by his appelation.38 Bazaz would concur with Gonda's explanation of names in its application to the BG where Bazaz states, "There is confusion about the personality of Sri Krishna whether he is a human being or divinity" (p. 217, note 12). Richard Gotshalk assumes that the epithets are purposive rather than casually utilized. He provides an "Index of Epithets for Arjuna and Krsna." At times his translation effort seems fanciful as with the name Hrsikesa which he translates as "Lord-of-the-Senses" rather than the less fanciful and more generally accepted "Bristling-hair. " 39 Such liberties can be easily excused based upon its literary value in the total translation effort. Gotshalk' s translation is perhaps the most readable of the four; his book would serve quite nicely as an introductory text for new students of the BG. In addition to a translation, Gotshalk provides a commentary intending to attune the reader "first and foremost to the drama" of the BG, and a section of notes in which he provides the reader with some modern interpretations of specific verses of the BG to help explain the text. Gotshalk has treated the text as literature rather than theology or philosophy. He translates the epithets to enhance the characterizations of the two figures. He associates hair to the human qualities of Krishna and the quintessential facets of the drama for Arjuna, the times when Arjuna is psychologically most vulnerable. Arjuna's psychological disposition is upset by the battle in the initial two chapters and by his religious experience in Chapter 11. Krishna remains undisturbed throughout and with his senses controlled. He never wavers over the proper course of action. Gotshalk characterizes these aspects of their personalities by skillfully handling various epithets used in the dialogue. Gudakesa, an epithet of Arjuna, occurs in 1.24 and II.9 when Arjuna refused to fight. The epithet also occurs in X.20and XI. 7 preceding Arjuna's experience of the viivarüpa form of deity. The association of hair to Arjuna highlights and subtly relates these two incongruous and upsetting experiences; at both times Arjuna is overcome by the experience of the moment and is addressed as "Thick-Hair." 34</page><page sequence="16">The association of hair with Krishna's character occurs in the early parts of the dialogue, 1.31,11.54, and III. 1, when Arjuna expresses total belief in Krishna's words in X.14, when Sanjaya recounts that Arjuna has heard Krishna tell him to fight in XL 35, and at the end of the dialogue in XVIII. 76. In all of these instances Krishna is addressed as "Keáava," which is translated as "Fair-Hair." This name corresponds to Krishna's role as Arjuna's teacher. The epithet "Hrsikda" on the other hand, serves to highlight another aspect of Krishna's character, Krishna who is in complete control of his senses. This epithet occurs in 1.15,21, 24; II.9, 10; XI.36; and XVIII.l. While the translation "Lord-of-the-Senses" may suggest to the reader Krishna's divinity due to the English phrasing, it equally suggests Krishna's self-control at times when Arjuna's senses have overcome his congnitive faculties. In this sense the epithet attributes to Krishna a vital character trait as guru. The use of the epithets Krishna and "Hrsikda" in XVIII.l, involving the difference between the abandonment of action and the abandonment of potential gains believed to accrue through the performance of specified actions, reflects a divine/human distinction. Gotshalk's sensitivity to the two dimensions of Krishna's personality, the human teacher and the divine guru, adds an exceptional dimension to his translation for the English-reading audience. His literary treatment of the text supplies a human dimension to this conversation between Krishna and Arjuna which is too often overlooked. Concerning "proper names and standard epithets," Bolle has "not made many attempts at translation" (p. 245). It is difficult to understand how Bolle can shy away from this task while at the same time calling for translators to render difficult words in the guest language rather than ignore them. He does translate names and epithets, but his translations are filtered through an interpretive bias akin to the syncretistic theory discussed above. One of his principal interpretive assumptions or strategies is that "Krsna is none other than God, Visnu himself, and in chapter 11 he reveals himself in his full glory to Arjuna" (p. 219). This interpretive corollary represents apresentist interpretation oftheBG, a modern understanding of the text fixed within the mainstream Hindu interpretation of the BG. It is not an assumption shared by all. Van Buitenen, who attempts to view the text in its initial cultural historical moment, notes in reference to the use of the vocative "Visnu" in XI. 30, "Rare use of Visnu who does not at all figure in the Gïtâ as the author of the Krsna avatara" (p. 167, note 7 to Chap. 33 [11]). Regarding Bolle' s treatment of epithets, he has made the text more opaque than need be for the reader of translations. A consideration of his translation of epithets affords us an example of the problems inherent in the dynamic-equivalence translation strategy. Let us consider the name Vishnu in the BG. The BG uses the name Vishnu only three times in the entire text (X.21; XL 24, 30). Yet, among these three instances the name Vishnu appears in Bolle's translation only once. In X.21 Bolle's text reads "Of the Gods of Heaven, I am Visnu" (p. 117). The Gods of Heaven are specifically mentioned by name and identified as the Adityas in the text. The Adityas are prominent in the early Vedic texts and belong to a theological conception which the BG seems to be revamping.40 The transformation of Vedic conceptions of divinity in the historical development ofVaishnavism and Hinduism more generally are perhaps emphasized in this translation. Bolle translates the two vocatives "O Visnu" in chapter 11 as "ÖGod," which nullifies the quality of the deity referenced in this portion of the text. These seven verses contain images suggestive of many ideas about God, but if Krishna is specifically Vishnu as Bolle contends, then it makes no sense to obscure the J5G's specific uses of the name Vishnu. Bolle's use of a minimum of names, a reduction of the epithets used in the BG to a mere fraction of the textual diversity encountered in the original, is a translation strategy which makes the parallel of Krishna and 35</page><page sequence="17">Arjuna to God and man more readily transparent. The lack of diverse names encountered in the textual development of the personalities of these two characters streamlines their personalities and obliterates any subtle nuances conveyed by the text through naming. Feuerstein and van Buitenen have not translated the epithets found in the BG, preferring instead to transliterate the proper names directly from the Sanskrit. But there is one name which allows us to bring these two translations into this comparison of epithets in translation. It would do us well in this discussion of names to consider the name Vasudeva, which occurs in the BG four times. Vasudeva is the name of the Supreme Spirit discoursed upon in Chapter 7 of the BG (VII. 19). Secondly, Krishna equates himself with Vasudeva as the preeminent member of the Vrsm clan (X.37). Most significant are the final two occurrences of this name. Arjuna' s visionary experience in Chapter 1 1 is attributed to Vasudeva: it is Vasudeva who resumes a human appearance for Arjuna following the viÉvarûpadarÉana (XI.50). Finally, the conversation overheard by Sanjaya and reported to the blind King Dhrtarastra is a conversation between Vasudeva and Partha (XCIII.74). Vasudeva is a difficult name to translate. Bhandarkar examined the use of names amonr literary sources contemporary with the BG in seeking to understand the various and dist' Λ strands which constituted the foundations of early Vaishnava theology as found in the BG. He notes that the grammatical structure of this name is ambiguous, that "... Vasudeva means both the individual of that name and his sons" (p. 12, note 11). Bhandarkar argues, however, that Krishna in the BG is identical with Vasudeva and not his son (pp. 11-19, note 11). Still, the ambiguity in meaning has created differences in English translations, differences which are potentially revealing considering the important associations of this name in the BG. Among our translators Feuerstein wavers between the two possibilities. The son-of- Vasudeva is the Supreme divinity, is preeminent among the Vrsni clan, and is the principal participant in this conversation. Vasudeva, howver, is named as the one who reappears in human form following Arjuna' s vision. This alternation is in direct contradiction to Feuerstein' s intention to follow a fixed-equivalent translation strategy. He provides no justification for his alternative choice and provides us with a concrete example of the translator as interpreter. Bolle has taken the greatest liberties among the four translations with the name Vasudeva. Vasudeva becomes "God" in VII. 19, "Krsna" (X.37, XI.50), and in the final textual usage "son of Vãsudeva" (XVIII.74). Bolle is obviously attempting to approximate the intent of the Sanskrit within the English medium. Considering his treatment of the epithets of Vishnu and Vasudeva, and without questioning his sincere intentions, one cannot help but wonder when the liberties of a translator prevent the reader's access to the text's own intentions and thereby produce distortions. Gotshalk and van Buitenen use the proper name Vasudeva throughout their translations. Gotshalk makes this conversation one between a man and another man's son. But the son in this verse is Partha's son (Arjuna). Here we have another instance of a translator's liberty with the text which is literarily suggestive without exceeding the bounds of grammatical or semantic geasibility. Gotshalk captures the spirit of the text while providing a subtle reminder that Arjuna sought instruction from Krishna. 36</page><page sequence="18">Van Buitenen's translation is quite literal, which is a benefit for those who want to read from the translation into the Sanskrit; but literalness is not necessarily to be preferred for the first-time reader of the text because some of the complexities encountered in the translation make reading difficult. Both van Buitenen and Bolle reprint the critical text transliterated into the Roman script on the opposite page to make it readily accessible and encourage readers to consort with the Sanskrit. Edgerton published a translation intended to serve as a guide for Sanskrit students in which he included the Sanskrit text (1944). The Sanskrit text was also included in many editions of Annie Besant's translation. The Sanskrit original contains two verse forms. The verse forms are not reproducible in English, although methods for pointing to the form of language have occasionally been attempted by some translators. Feuerstein adopts the most traditional format, which is to translate each verse individually and place the appropriate number of the verse in the margin. The two types of verses from the original are indistinguishable; the format reinforces the disjointedness of his translation. Bolle uses a similar format by numbering and separating the individual verses. He distinguishes the verse forms in his translation by shortening the lines and increasing the number of lines per verse for the more complex meter. Gotshalk, on the other hand, provides a prose-style format which is not broken up into individual verses, although there are numbers in the margins. He does not acknowledge through his format any distinction between the two types of Sanskrit verse forms. Van Buitenen also prepared a prose-style format with numbers in the margins for every five verses. The text is presented in paragraphs except for the older, longer verse form typical of Vedic Sanskrit. Van Buitenen translates these verses into individual four-line verses clearly discernible from the rest of the text. This is an innovative format strategy, which suggests a concern for the form as well as the content of the text. Translation and the Unity of the BG. When Edgerton wrote that he was prepared to accept the unity of the BG, his remarks were directed towards those scholars who argued about what was original and what were added interpolations in the text. Edgerton was simply referring to the text as comprising 700 verses. As to the meaning of the contents Edgerton felt it "unsystematic- one may fairly say helter-skelter-in its arrangement. It often contradicts itself, or at least it seems to do so."41 Edgerton's analysis combined ideas from various places throughout the text into a logical argument expressing the BG's intended position. Edgerton voiced a sense of dissatisfaction with this method of presentation: that "to present the book's ideas in logical relationship is to violate its spirit . . ."as "the Gitã makes no attempt to be logical or systematic in its philosophy" (p. 95, note 60). The last fifty years have witnessed an erosion of Edgerton's reticence to synthesize the BG's meaning among BG scholars. Perhaps the primary reason can be noted in the title of A. Sharma's recent book considered above. A majority of modern BG scholars no longer examine questions regarding the religious foundation of the BG. The BG has become a Hindu text plain and simple, in spite of the troublesome historical detail regarding the lack of a "Hindu" religion in the period of the BG's compilation. There is the problematic tendency among textualists to read the present back into the past, a fault in historical method encountered in BG scholarship. There is no consideration for the historical development within the Indian cultural tradition, especially such important innovations as the rise of temple worship and ritual. The temple rose to prominence in the society by the time of the commentators which Sharma so interestingly surveys. Indeed, although he does not present it as such, one could read Sharma's chapters on the Vedanta BG commentators as a history of the dynamic 37</page><page sequence="19">between sacrificial religion and religious practices organized around the temple: a survey of how various thinkers co-opted the text in describing systems of belief in relation to the religious environment of their own times. A number of assumptions in modern critical studies ignore or obviate developments in the religious tradition of India's people. Feuerstein begins his introductory remarks: The most outstanding characteristic of the Bhagavad-Gitd is its syncretic approach. It takes a broad integrative view of life. However, it does not pretend to propound a fully developed philosophical system in which each and every component is well defined and demarcated from the rest. None the less, the world-view (darfana) which it promulgates is an intrinsically coherent and meaningful one. (p. 1) He also claims that a synthesis of ideas is less than desirable, but is all the same a "convenient device." But where Edgerton chose to organize his synthesis around concepts present in the BG, Feuerstein has chosen to begin with western philosophical categories in his analysis, i.e., ontology, epistemology, theology, anthropology. Rhetorically, Feuerstein reads somewhat apologetically; the essays reveal a sensitivity toward the suitability of Indian religious thought rather than consisting of a discussion of the BG. He gives the reader no clear indication of what is to be found/encountered in the BG, nor does he attempt to position the BG in the broader Indian religious tradition. Rather, Feuerstein provides a hodge-podge of philosophical references which does not prepare the reader for the text or explain* the translator's felt shortcomings or successes of his translation. I agree with Feuerstein; it was a shame that the translation was not ready and could not be included in his previously published Introduction to the Bhagavad-Gitd: Its Philosophy and Cultural Setting.42 He should have delayed its publication, for the introduction he provides for this translation is an example of intensely subjective comparative philsophy. Feuerstein offers lots of comparative allusions, but no presentation of Indian ideas before the philosophical pigeon-holing takes place. It is as if we were asked to study Renoir's or Monet's use of color in oil paintings through poor postcard reproductions. The translations of Bolle and van Buitenen also include critical essays. Both translators strive to locate the BG within the Indian religious tradition and its literature. They begin with specific concepts and seek to identify satisfactory explanations of the meanings of those concepts relative to the BG and its position in the changing religious ideology. For both scholars the BG is a text with religious import, so each pursues a discussion on the BG's portrayal of ritual (karma). The subject was first identified as a translation problem in Warren Hastings' letter introducing the Wilkins traslation two centuries ago. He remarks that certain terms "maybe impossible to render by any of the known terms of science in our language, or even to make them intelligible by definition. This is probably the case with some of the English phrases, as those of "Action," "Application," "Practice," &amp;c. which occur in Mr. Wilkins' s translation; . . ,"43 Western interpretation has advanced the idea that the BG's devotional religion fostered a religious consciousness involving a personally experienced deity. This interpretation supported the perceived anti-ritualistic sentiment expressed in the BG. Western historical interpretation now generally conceives the BG to be at the center of a unified religious tradition which evolved from the Vedic sacrificai tradition toward Hindu devotional religion. Scholars too often conceive of religion as an evolving monolithic institution and place the BG at the fulcrum of this shifting religious ideology. 38</page><page sequence="20">Bolle seems to adhere to this monolithic view of Indian religion. There is ritual and little else. He acknowledges that "Terms bearing on ritual have been the most neglected by the translators of Sanskrit texts" (p. 250). This claim points to the confusion this subject may hold for the reader of a translation. Bolle's primary intention is to bring out the BG's attitude toward ritual; his work represents a true scholarly sectarian translation. Within his wordings we find the conscious expression of a western interpretive position around the topic of ritual, which is nurtured to its fullest expression. Bolle's critical essay begins with a discussion of the hermeneutical problem of word choice in translation. One of the unique aspects of Bolle's translation is his preparation of two indices; one catalogues the Sanskrit equivalents for English words, and the other the English equivalents for Sanskrit words. These are interesting inclusions in a translation; the indices share the translator's sense of the semantic range of words in both languages. These indices also allow us to examine Bolle's word choices for translating the word "karma"; these include ritual, rite, work, action, cultic act, actions and rites, sacrifice, and other variations on these words; the reader is even informed when the word "karman" was omitted in the translation of a verse. How successful he has been in his attempt to split hairs and interpret the intent of the text is a complex question. At times it seems that these choices are arbitrary, for there is no real sense provided the reader as to the significance of the author's choices; the intended shades of meaning never become clear. Bolle is at his best discussing the meaning latent in English words. He is unquestionably correct in consciously avoiding the word "sin. "This is one of the unfortunate choices made by Gotshalk and Feuerstein (i.e., verse 11.38). As Bolle notes, sin is not an aspect of the human condition, not an innate aspect of human nature (p. 252). Unfortunately, Bolle does not carry the argument further to explain that whatever can be called sin belongs to the material world in the religious outlook of the BG. Man exists in relation to the world and, therefore, in relation to anything which can be called "sin." The triadic relation between humans, the world, and god is variously explained in the BG, and the variety of viewpoints makes it unique. Western interpretations sensitive to theological questions have tended to stress the nature of god with no relative concern for the relation of humans and world to god. These three relationships are never purely dualistic, i.e., humans and god, or humans and the world. The relationship between two categories is always mediated by the third (as suggested by Sharma quoted above). Bolle never clearly states this, and his reductivist tendencies in translating names and epithets obscures the complexity of the nature of god, and god's relation to both humans and the material world. Bolle's translation is only moderately successful in dealing with terms involving ritual, his oversimplifications of the 5G' s language through a dynamic-equivalence translation strategy allow some obscurities into the translation for which the BG, full enough of obscurities as it is for scholars, cannot be held responsible. Van Buitenen also identifies ritual as one of the topics requiring greater attention. He approaches the subject through a reconstruction of developments in the religious tradition. He chronicles changes in the relation betwen humans, god, and the world, which are evident in the religious textual tradition. Van Buitenen writes that initially humans sacrificed to the gods, who in turn maintained the cosmos. Secondly, humans themselves maintained the cosmos because they perceived ritual performance rather than deities as vital. This development significantly altered the status of humans. Thirdly, a reaction ensued which questioned the efficacy of ritual and advocated humans' ability to have a direct experience of the divine. This reaction, according to van Buitenen, occurs within and outside of the Vedic ritual tradition. Even though there is an evolution of ideas van Buitenen recognizes that the older ways of thought did not become extinct and the newer 39</page><page sequence="21">conceptions did not completely replace the older ritualistic beliefs. Many religious ideas co- existed and, van Buitenen states, "it is against this background that Krsna's doctrine of the act needs to be viewed" (p. 16). Van Buitenen's explanation allows us to observe a clear indication of the inter-relatedness of the three categories in the various strains of thought addressed in the BG. It is against a backdrop of diverse understandings about the nature of divinity and the nature of ritual that van Buitenen discusses the meaning of the term "yoga." Whatever the reason, it is unfortunate that Gotshalk and Feuerstein translate the term yoga with such English equivalents as mystery, mystic power, mysticism, and the worst choice of all, "magic." Such interpretations are not inconcsistent with popular western notions regarding religious experience, the nature of the divine, and divine grace. These interpretations are unsatisfactory as translations and certainly distort the complexity of thought in the text. While individuals may have mysterious or mystical experiences through the practice of yoga, the practice of yoga is unjustly confused in these translations with the experiences such practice engenders. The BG prescribes a number of yogas. Much to the dismay of translators and textualists who seek to understand the text, the BG talks positively about each yoga and individually proclaims each one superior to the others. Van Buitenen defines yoga as "a self-yoking to a particular effort to win a goal" (p. 17). An often-quoted passage from the BG, "Yoga is skill in action/means," captures van Buitenen's interpretation when we remember that there is triadic relation involved in the 5G's attitude toward ritual. Yoga not only relates to humans' quest to experience the divine, but to a variety of possible relations between humans and the world. When we recall that humans exist in relation to the world and to the divine, then van Buitenen's explanation of yoga suggests that the BG recognizes more than one optimal type of relationship between humans, the world, and god. The BG provides multiple options for humans to achieve understanding in the course of its dialogue. Indeed, it recognizes many character types just for the human component of this triadic formulation. While van Buitenen's introductory essay reveals a great sensitivity for the historical moment of the BG's compilation, he claims ' no particular novelty' for his translation. This does not mean, however, that he has eliminated every translation problem. In Chapter 3 van Buitenen translates the Sanskrit terms buddhi (verses 1 and 2), sãmkhya (v. 3), and jüäna (ν. 42) with the same English word, "insight." In this instance he has simplified the text for the reader and seemingly for the translator by using fewer fine distinctions. Still, the success of a translation depends upon how much of the subtleties the translator can bring from the host language into the guest language. The problems with van Buitenen's translation are few. This example from Chapter 3 serves to recall the present felt need for a critical study of the text. Van Buitenen has suggested that within the BG a number of religious ideologies converge. These ideologies, I would suggest, are represented through the use of specific words and phrases which need to be studied as they occur within smaller portions of the text. The terms buddhi, samkhya, and jnana were not clearly comprehended in Telang's day a century ago. Edgerton participated in correcting certain fundamental errors in the understanding and interpretation of these terms. Now van Buitenen has taken scholarly understanding even further. However, until we turn exclusively to the text and allow the text to name and constitute its own analytic categories, we will advance no further. A concept such as ritual, which Bolle suggests means many things in the BG, is just one among many terms which must be scrutinized from within rather than from without. 40</page><page sequence="22">Conclusion. What we can learn from this most recent outpouring of scholarly attention directed towards the BG is that there is the need for a critical study of the text, and more specifically for a critical study of the text which does not begin by assuming the religious importance of the BG due to its theological content. The work done on the text so far assumes that the unity of the BG means that the BG must logically and consistently propound a specific point of view. Wilkins suggested so much two centuries ago when he wrote in his Preface: It seems as if the principal design of these dialogues was to unite all the prevailing modes of worship of those days; and by setting up the doctrine of the unity of the Godhead, in opposition to idolatrous sacrifices, and the worship of images, to undermine the tenets inculcated by the Veds; ... (p. 24, note 64) Many translators since Wilkins have taken similar positions in approaching the contents of the BG and assuming that its contents are rationally consistent from some objective point of view. No scholar has as yet, to my knowledge, approached the text as a collection of arguments, arguments encased within chapters which are internally consistent without concern for statements taken from different parts of the text. The BG consists of a dialogue in which a number of questions are asked, some of those questions are rephrased, yet all of the questions put by Arjuna to Krishna are answered. This represents an innovation over the upanishadic practice of a participant in a dialogue failing to conjecture further on a specific inquiry with the admonition that to say more would 'make one's head fall off.' The BG expresses no such limitations in the expression of knowledge; all inquiries are met with substantive answers. At present, the need in BG studies is for the study and analysis of smaller portions of the text. Such an approach would immediately end many of the arguments about how contradictory, irrational, or mystical portions of the text are in relation to other portions of the text. Arguments from individual chapters would be considered for their own merits rather than from some universalist perspective. Rather than concern over whether Vishnu or Vasudeva was intended to be identified with Krishna, or whether buddhi always means intellect (seemingly to represent Buddhist influence) or spirit (with its Vedantic connotations), scholarship and analysis would prosper most by attempting to comprehend the significance of words within the particular argument being advanced and developed. The BG needs to be valued descriptively rather than normatively. Attaching a descriptive value to the text would halt the previous method of analyzing statements from various portions of the text because of their similarity or dissimilarity of sentiment. When it is valued descriptively the BG would be perceived to consist of a number of arguments. It is a text unfavorably dealt with through a structural analysis which identifies a singular ideological position, because the BG 'structurally' approaches human life through a variety of positions, an approach which yields alternative resolutions.44 What we need to reconsider at present is the degree to which the original BG was exclusively a sectarian textbook of devotional Hinduism, propounding a unified doctrine, or alternatively, determine if there are a number of social groups potentially addressed and offered instruction through multiple doctrines. Scholars have interpreted the text as a dialogue rather than as a reported dialogue. In the BG Krishna speaks not only to Arjuna and solves not only Arjuna's present dilemma, he also speaks to a multifarious audience with a multitude of dilemmas, and his instruction serves them too. 41</page><page sequence="23">Even within the rather sterile historical outlook of the predominant Advaita Vedanta philosophical interpretation, one very general and oversimplified suggestion can be put forward. In the context of the Indian religious tradition we should note that from the Vedas to the BG there is a shift in emphasis. The term rta initially signified the dynamic and changing phenomena of a closed yet ordered universe. It signified the natural order, an order which subsumed humans.45 In the BG, however, we find rta already displaced and the emergence of the concept of dharma. Dharma signifies the natural order within a greater cosmic order in which humans attempts to situate themselves.46 This ideological transition represented by the terminology suggests a recognition in human self-reflective thought. This development is apparent in the changing nature of the status and purpose of ritual, in the movement from the gods as maintainers of the cosmic order to human ritual behavior as directly responsible for the support of the cosmos. And it is apparent in humans' striving for a relationship with the divine, initially to maintain the cosmos and eventually to grant humans freedom from rebirth within the order of nature. The appearance of humans as a reflective entity in texts such as the BG requires that we look to such texts for explanations of the idea of human self-reflectivity. lam suggesting that awareness and discussions of self-reflectivity, of psychology if you will, were carried on in various arguments, arguments which have their own internal assumptions which define and limit the eventual conclusions logically attainable. It is the individual arguments of the BG, however they are eventually determined, which should command our attention in the search for the various ways in which the self-reflective nature of humans was conceived and incorporated into a religious framework. It is an analytic strategy that enlivens the text with the possibility of competing modes of discourse which, if we have truly learned from the past, we must learn to respect not denigrate, admire not ignore, to evaluate not eliminate, and most importantly for BG scholarship, to recognize the BG's unity of purpose if not its unity of thought.

Fitzgerald suggests that the main intent of the BG discourse within the Mahãbharata is to advocate karma as the responsibility to act. He summarizes this 'deliberately speculative and suggestive' paper: What I have focused on here as the major themes of the text's central argument-anthropomorphic monotheism, the karmayoga, and the narrative account of the critical historical events in which these two themes were actually revealed by God. . . , are but part of the whole, the central supporting shaft as it were" (p. 627). The treatment of the Mahãbharata by those who seek a unity of intent in its combination of myth and history has a precursor in F. M. Cornford, who provides a very early example of scholarly attempt to reconcile the historical and mythical perspective in Thucydides. See his interpretation of the artistic/psychological unity in Thucydides' history of the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides Mythistoricus (New York: Greenwood Press, 1969 [1907]). 34. F. Max Müller encouraged this error through his dating for the sütra period in A History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature (London and Edinburgh: Williams and Norgate, 1960) as between 600 and 200 A.D., especially those connected with the Vedas (p. 249). John Davies believed that Patanjali revised Kapila's thought in his Hindu Philosophy: The Sãnkhya Kãrikã of 7 s warn Krishna, 2nd ed. (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner and Co., 1894). Perhaps the best evidence that a debate existed and continued on this question comes from Franklin Edgerton who wrote-in italics: "Nowhere is there a suggestion that it [sãmkhyá'~or Yoga either-means any particular system of metaphysical truth" (p. 5).

Structuralist approaches, which seek to uncover the statement of social paradoxes encoded in myth, reinforce the western search for a unity of intent in the BG't contents. Usually, structuralist analysis relates just humans and god as was suggested above, without concern for their independent valuation within the individual sections of the text. When we consider the triadic relationship which holds between humans, world, and god, and perceive in the text a specific means for valuing each of these three components independently, then the limitations of the structuralist method, tc adequately assess the BG's contents, become apparent. 45. I have obviously simplified the explanation considerably. On this subject V. S. Apte remarks "The Supreme Spirit.

Ingalls in their articles, bearing the same title, "Dharma and Moksa," Philosophy East and West, 7:1,2 (1957), 33-40 and 41-48 respectively. 46</page></plain_text>
