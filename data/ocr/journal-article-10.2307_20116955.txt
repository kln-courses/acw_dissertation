<plain_text><page sequence="1">KATHLEEN V. WILKES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND COMMON-SENSE PSYCHOLOGY ABSTRACT. This paper explores the relationship between common-sense psychology (CSP) and scientific psychology (SP) - which we could call the mind-mind problem. CSP has come under much attack recently, most of which is thought to be unjust or misguided. This paper's first section examines the many differences between the aims, interests, explananda, explanantia, methodology, conceptual frameworks, and relationships to the neurosciences, that divide CSP and SP. Each of the two is valid within its own territory, and there is no competition between them - primarily because CSP is not, and has no interest in being, a 'scientific theory'. In the second section some implications are drawn. First, neither CSP nor SP has the mind-body problem in its familiar form. Second, CSP, for excellent reasons, is not equipped to handle irrational or non-rational behaviour; there are some grounds for believing that this can and should be the task of SP. Third, 'philosophical psychology', or armchair 'theories' of action, perception, etc., are doomed to failure. And, fourth, the realm of the psychological is so heterogeneous that no single model for either CSP or SP is likely to succeed. INTRODUCTION Fashions in philosophy are curious things. Only a few years ago, few people talked in terms of 'common-sense' (or 'folk') psychology; in stead, they talked of 'the mind', 'the mental', 'the psychological'. But, suddenly, it has assumed centre stage. This is primarily because of the recent interest in it qua scientific theory. Some (e.g., P. M. Churchland 1981; P. S. Churchland 1986; Stich 1983) see it as a would-be scientific theory, but a very inadequate and stagnating one which needs to be 'eliminated' and supplanted by something quite different. Others, for example, Davidson (1970,1974), think that we are stuck with common sense psychology, but that it can never be tightened into a genuine science and that, therefore, psychology is not a science. (Revealingly, the title of his 1974 paper is 'Psychology as Philosophy'.) A third numerous group - in particular, many of those whose work is described sometimes as 'cognitive science', or 'philosophical psychology' (Fodor 1975, 1987; Field 1978; and Lycan 1981, are good examples) - think that it is basically all right as a fledgling science: "We have no reason to doubt that it is possible to have a scientific psychology that vindicates commonsense belief/desire explanation" (Fodor 1987, p. 16).

WILKES people expect that common-sense psychological concepts will provide the conceptual framework within which 'theories' of action, perception, and thought will derive. I think that almost all these eminent characters miss the heart of the matter. I am 'for' common-sense psychology, but not for the reasons that any of the above would wish to offer. Note the title of this paper: it is not 'Folk Psychology'! That would be too 'folksy': once it is so baptised, Folk Psychology inevitably finds it hard to live down its folksiness. There is an inbuilt temptation to see it as 'twee', a bit primitive. And that is one of the biggest mistakes around. So, 'Com mon-Sense Psychology', hence 'CSP', and 'Scientific Psychology', hence 'SP'. In this paper I try to do two things. First, I try to distinguish CSP from SP. Second, I want to draw out some implications of these claims, for instance, that the 'theories of action/perception' conceived by philos ophers in armchairs are and will be going nowhere. Put more generally, the point is that the new and recently-fashionable label 'philosophical psychology' has no content, any more than 'philosophical physics', or 'philosophical chemistry' would have, were anyone silly enough to imag ine them. There is room for an enterprise called 'the philosophy of mind'; there is also room for the philosophy of psychology as one branch of the philosophy of science. But that's all: 'philosophical psy chology' should have been aborted. So I shall offer first: the distinction between CSP and SP; and second: some implications. 1. 'THE MIND-MIND PROBLEM'.* CSP VERSUS (?) SP Ebbinghaus said: "Psychology has a long past and a short history". What he meant was clear. I shall begin with the "long past", but as will quickly become apparent, description of CSP will entail discussion of SP too. Long before we had written records, humans had language, de veloped tools, and lived in a complex social environment. Social animals with a massive cranial capacity and high encephalization quotient,1 living in a complex society - that is, I am not talking about sheep, which are gregarious/social characters, but which are also rather stupid - have many problems. Humans have the problem of surviving in an environment that contains many possibilities and many dangers; but,</page><page sequence="3">SCIENTIFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND COMMON-SENSE PSYCHOLOGY 17 equally, they must be able to co-exist with their peers, to persuade them to undertake sometimes unpleasant tasks, to mollify, encourage, or support them, to find out when it is necessary to kill them off, to woo and win them in the face of rivals, etc., ad indefinitum. This requires a sophisticated ability to predict the actions of their conspeci fics; to read expressions, interpret linguistic and non-linguistic behav iour; to invent and use artifacts. The fact that we are still here suggests that we got much of it right. Then came written records. The earliest such records we possess show how sophisticated common-sense psychology was. Very early records, however, are somewhat thin; so I shall turn to the more familiar ground of the earliest Greek writings of major importance, Homer in particular. The descriptions of character and behaviour given by Homer - in The Odyssey especially, but also in The Iliad - are instantly recognisable today. Much surprises us: we find that in order to explain irrational behaviour, Homer refers to the gods (whereas we may cite Freud). But Homer's understanding of the human psyche is as recognisable in 1991 as is Chaucer's or Proust's. Plus ?a change. Moving from Homer, why do we still stage the plays of Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes? (These are among the more 'psychologi cal' ancient Greek dramatists, especially Euripides.) We do so precisely because the chords struck by these writers still echo today; because the playwrights concerned had identified common strands, threads, preoccupations, concerns. Strawson wrote "[t]here is a massive central core of human thinking which has no history. . . there are categories and concepts which, in their most fundamental character, change not at all" (1959, p. 10). However we need not stick just to the cerebral productions of playwrights and philosophers. How do generals win battles? By coming up with secure and well-founded predictions about what the opposing commander is planning, about the endurance, mor ale, and enthusiasm of his own forces, with ideas about how best to motivate them, and so forth. This was as true when the Greeks defeated Xerxes as it was during the Second World War. The general point is that from the 'start' of human history, we have needed to produce well backed, sophisticated, and penetrating analyses of human behaviour and motivation - and that we did. The proper study of mankind not only is, but has to be, man. It will soon be clearer why I am spending so much time on this point; meanwhile, I shall quote a telling passage</page><page sequence="4">18 KATHLEEN V. WILKES from Dennett to support the claim above. We do not need to cite Proust, Dostoievsky or Henry James to illustrate the depth and detail of common-sense psychology, because watching a film with a highly original and unstereotypical plot, we see the hero smile at the villain and we all swiftly and effortlessly arrive at the same complex theoretical diagnosis: 'Aha!' we conclude (but perhaps not consciously), 'he wants her to think he doesn't know she intends to defraud his brother!'. (1981, pp. 41-42). The brute fact is that we all do this sort of thing rather well, and that our analyses, as Dennett's example illustrates, are quite extraordinary in their penetration, accuracy, and predictive/explanatory power. Greek audiences, though, were no less capable of interpreting a piece of body language from one of Aristophanes's characters on stage.2 This seems to me most patently obvious as soon as we reflect on our most mundane and routine social activities, let alone when we reflect on the diagnoses we make when the behaviour of friends or colleagues seem initially out of character or puzzling: we employ unthinkingly, and largely successfully, a rich, intricate, and sophisticated framework of CSP. Thus, I shall not argue for this at length - the claim, as exemplified in the quotation from Dennett, speaks for itself. SP could not provide such an explanation of why the hero smiled at the villain. But this is not a criticism of SP; it is not trying to. No more (and for the same reasons) does contemporary physics take on as an explanandum the following sequence of events: John was ironing his shirt; the iron slipped off the board on to his bare feet; his little toe was fractured, and his second toe mildly burned. My argument will be that CSP and SP are not in competition; in other words, there is no 'mind-mind' problem. They are not in competition for several reasons. I have argued this elsewhere3 and so my summary will be brief. It all stems from the basic idea that the claim, made most strongly perhaps by P. M. Churchland, is false. Churchland asserts: Not only is folk psychology a theory, it is so obviously a theory that it must be held a major mystery why it has taken until the last half of the twentieth century for philosophers to realise it. The structural features of folk psychology parallel perfectly those of mathematical physics; the only difference lies in the respective domains of abstract entities they exploit - numbers in the case of physics, and propositions in the case of psychology. (1981, p. 71) But, contrary to this view and to the weaker claim that common-sense</page><page sequence="5">SCIENTIFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND COMMON-SENSE PSYCHOLOGY 19 psychology is a quasi-scientific theory, and that an elaboration of it is both needed and would make it a genuine theory, CSP is not a 'theory' in any substantial sense of those terms and, hence, neither is it interested in the same phenomena as is SP nor is it subject to the same criteria for assessment as is SP. To support my claim that CSP isn't a 'theory', I shall offer a rather extended quotation from Hacking. Hacking is talking of Feyerabend's claim about 'our habit of saying the table is brown when we view it under normal circumstances', and comments: Now taken literally . . . this is, to be polite, rather hastily said. For example, what is this 'habit of saying the table is brown when we view it under normal circumstances'? I doubt that ever in my life, before, have I uttered either the sentence 'the table is brown' or 'the table seems to be brown'. I am certainly not in the habit of uttering the first sentence when looking at a table in good light. I have only met one person with such a habit, a French lunatic... Of course we have all sorts of expectations, prejudices, opinions, working hypotheses and habits when we say anything.... But when I read aloud, or make corrections on this page I simply interact with something of interest to me, and it is wrong to speak of assumptions. In particular it is wrong to speak of theoretical assumptions. I have not the remotest idea what a theory of non-distortion by the air would be like. Of course if you want to call every belief, proto-belief, and belief that could be invented, a theory, do so. (1983, pp. 175-76) But if we do so, then theory-shmeory; everything becomes a theory, and that becomes equivalent to saying that nothing is. The term 'theory', as Hacking comments just before the above quotation, is "best reserved for some fairly specific body of speculation or propositions with a definite subject matter" (ibid., p. 175). We surely should support this: science is an activity distinct from what goes on in conversation on the street, no matter how 'continuous' they may be. Continuity holds be tween entities that can be far apart: bumps in my lawn and the Hima layas. 'Mere' continuity doesn't in any way imply that there is not a very substantial difference between elements on the continuum. The continuum holds in the following respect: CSP and SP are both concerned to explain and predict the behaviour of humans and other animals. But after that anodyne point, the similarities end. SP attempts to explain and predict generally. CSP however is interested in explain ing the particular. George wants to know why his daughter Georgina has become a skinhead, a mathematics professor, or a born-again Christian, rather than why teenagers are tempted to become skinheads, to take up mathematics, or to get waylaid by fundamentalism. And, he would</page><page sequence="6">20 KATHLEEN V. WILKES have a much better chance of finding a satisfactory explanation if he looked to the specificities of Georgina's individual history - which as her father he probably knows rather well - rather than if he resorted to his local university collection in psychology (which is not to say that he would not find indirect help there for his researches: more of that anon). CSP wants to know, roughly, why this X did exactly that action O at exactly that time and in this manner. (Compare here Dennett's audience at the film where the hero smiles at the villain.) SP wants to know how it is that people do the sorts of things that people character istically do do. This immediately has an obvious implication. While both CSP and SP purport to explain and predict, SP, unlike CSP, wants to do this systematically. That means that SP must search for a description (a) of behaviours, and (b) of psychological states, which could be described as 'natural kind' explanations. Talk of natural kinds has recently come under attack, indicted for being vague. Although there is something to this, I think the assault is wrongly directed. In any case, all I need here is assent to another anodyne point: science (all science) needs to find a description of its explananda and explanantia under which the former can be systematically explained by the latter. Arguably the primary reason for the fragmented state of SP at present is its inability to get an agreed taxonomy of its explananda and explanantia.4 But surely it would not and should not take on board, "applying for a mathematics chair at Oslo", but maybe, "talent/interest in mathematics". Compare: we don't ask physics to give us the microstructure of ashtrays, but we might ask for the microstructure of glass - and many ashtrays are made of glass. CSP is no more interested in natural kinds than a cook or a churchgoer is interested in the close species relationship between garlic and lilies, which undoubtedly engages the interest of biologists. (This is Dupr?'s example, and I shall be borrowing arguments and examples from his excellent 1981 article in the next paragraph or two, since I agree with him almost without reservation.) Cooks do not want lilies in the soup; and churchgoers have vested interests in putting lilies, but not cloves of garlic, in churches. Putnam is wrong: the man in the street does not always defer to experts. Even if the experts tell him that lilies and garlic are only marginally distinguishable, the layman knows - from his soup and from his church - that the expert is not answering his needs. The layman is indeed often concerned with natural kinds, whether</page><page sequence="7">SCIENTIFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND COMMON-SENSE PSYCHOLOGY 21 such kinds are psychological or physical. We - and here I speak as a layman - are interested in gold, oxygen, water, redwoods, trapdoor spiders, tigers, all of which are good candidates for being natural kinds. But the reason that common sense often coincides in its categorisation with the categories offered by science is not because common sense is interested in systematic explanation. Quite the reverse: we have all sorts of different, and often highly prudential, reasons. Gold is a valuable and decorative commodity; oxygen is essential to life, as is water; redwoods are enormous, and so are enormously striking; trapdoor spiders are fascinating; and tigers are not only impressive animals, but are also highly dangerous. More mundanely, common sense is just as fully concerned with categories that by no stretch of the imagination are natural kinds: farmers have to think about fences, policemen about riot shields, painters and art historians about paint-covered canvasses. We would not, I think, dream of asking the physical sciences to give us an account of fences, riot shields, or paint-covered canvasses. CSP is, or ought to be, in the same position. In other words, why should CSP - unlike common sense in every other domain - be expected to supply the categories appropriate for systematic science? As in any other domain, common-sense terms can be and are adopted by science - consider the 'spin' of an electron, or 'energy' - but they are invariably adapted: baked in a theoretical kiln, refined and defined to suit the (different) goals of the systematic study.5 Part of the problem here is of course that CSP is, and has been for millenia, very sophisticated and successful within its own domain, whereas SP has only recently celebrated its centenary.6 (This is because after Descartes we neglected Aristotle's theory of mind, incidentally. He did indeed pursue SP.) The 'long past' has distorted the 'short history'. This is less true of the relationship between common-sense physics and scientific physics. Even so, even if we accept (as we should accept) that common sense provides in all sciences one springboard from which science dives, diving boards are not swimming pools; that is, common sense can note regularities (water boils at about 100?C, and freezes at about 0?C; many octogenarians have poor short-term mem ory; there are far more earthquakes in Yugoslavia than in Britain). Science takes these observations (inter, of course, much alia) on board and then tries to work out to what extent they are true; and, insofar as they are true, why this might be (that up a mountain the boiling and freezing points of water change substantially; that many octogenarians</page><page sequence="8">22 KATHLEEN V. WILKES have a better short-term memory than some teenagers; that Yugoslavia may possibly have a decade with no earthquakes, while in that same period Britain suffers two or three). CSP needs such rough and handy rules of thumb, but does not need or desire to make them more precise, simply because it is not in the business of explaining systematically. What the man in the street needs is to be able to exploit his hearer's understanding of the fact that elderly people frequently have poor short-term memory, when what he wants to do is to explain why, when he was visiting his great aunt Henrietta, she locked him out of her house the preceding night. One may "exploit his hearer's understanding" but not through any grip, implicit or explicit, on 'laws'. Just as the apparatus of CSP is not rightly seen as a theory, so, equally, our command of it is not a command of laws. Or, to borrow again from Hacking's argument above, call them laws if you want to, but then the notion of a law gets devalued. All the weight in the so-called 'laws' of CSP found in the literature is taken, inevitably, by the capacious and indeterminate ceteris paribus (sometimes ceteris absentibus) conditions that make them true, but trivial - so platitudinous as to be vacuous. "Out of sight, out of mind" - true, ceteris paribus. Or, "Absence makes the heart grow fonder" - true, if a different set of ceteris are paribus. The grip that we indeed have, which explains our sophisticated mastery of this network of con cepts, is the grip we have on our own language, and our training in the links and implications between the elements of it: know-how. Some links are very strong. If someone is afraid of some event, he is likely also to not want it to happen. Some are much weaker. If someone is watching something, he is fairly likely to be interested in it. We know the sorts of things that generous people typically do. The so-called 'holism of the mental', or such a bland form of it as this, is or should be undisputed. But our success at CSP lies in finding our feet within it, not in mastering laws. Whether someone who is watching an event is or is not interested in it depends on what else - idiosyncratically - is true of his psychological make-up, as well as on the specific circum stances in which he finds himself. One reason for the success of CSP is the riotous richness of the framework. We can exploit overlapping shades of meaning, nuances, ambiguities, to convey accurately and precisely whatever we want. We can explain behaviour by citing wanting, wishing, desiring, craving,</page><page sequence="9">SCIENTIFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND COMMON-SENSE PSYCHOLOGY 23 hoping, lusting after, longing for; all in context these may convey quite different implications. And, as we have already seen, since CSP explanations are typically of specific actions of specific agents at specific times, they all belong to an equally specific and individual context. Consider the size of Roget's Thesaurus and then consider what pro portion of it is given over to 'mental' terms - a colossal proportion. Consider, too, how few of these terms have sharp definitions. It is precisely because they are free of such - they are in fact amorphous and nuance-ridden - that they enjoy the flexibility and richness that allows us to wield them to such effect in a given context. The richness of the context ensures that what is conveyed is precise, accurate, and economical, SP gets its precision from diametrically opposed sources. We have already seen that, unlike CSP, it searches for natural kind explananda and explanantia, and so seeks a systematic taxonomy. But this goes along with the ambition, shared by all scientific theories, to devise a sparse, non-redundant, and economical vocabulary, from which ambi guities, contextually-based nuances, and overlapping shades of mean ing, are to be banished, and where the ambition at least is to provide terms with sharp definitions.7 Further, such precision as SP has rests on the fact that the context is not unique or individual. This should not be a contentious fact. There is an ambition in science that experiments and observations should be repeatable. This is a remark that of course needs heavy qualification. As Hacking, again, has stressed, some ex periments are just too expensive - because of the size of the research team, or because chimpanzees cost so much - to be repeated. Thus, many experiments are not simply repeated, but are repeated with varia tions that may, with luck, serve the function both of testing the original findings and of taking them one step further. Moreover, that part of SP which involves the study of animals in the wild may produce reports of behaviour that are not observed again.8 Given such qualifications, though, repeatability is a goal, particularly for a science such as SP which is still struggling after scientific respectability. But then, if experi ments are to be repeated, with or without variations, then the pa rameters must be fixed and stable so that psychologists in Oxford can assess the findings of their colleagues in Ottawa. Put bluntly, it is because the context is so rich and unique that explanations in CSP are so precise; it is to the extent that the context of experiments in SP is</page><page sequence="10">24 KATHLEEN V. WILKES so sparse and repeatable (non-unique) that findings in SP win agree ment. We could even say that observations and experiments in SP aim to be context-transcendent. Related to this is the intended audience for explanations in CSP and SP. Just as the context for the former is unique to that explanatory occasion, so also is the hearer. Discussions of behaviour usually take place between people who know each other, who know what feature of the behaviour the other finds puzzling, who know and can guess how much the other is aware and unaware of features of the agent, of the circumstances of his action, etc. Thus massive amounts of relevant details can often simply be presupposed. The explanation of the same behaviour may need to be framed quite differently for another audience who may not only have a different degree of familiarity with the agent and the circumstances, but may also be puzzled by a quite different aspect of the event in question. Of course explanations in SP also make presuppositions - we do not need to be told that the experimenter was sober as he ran his rats through the T-maze. But because of the public and (in principle) repeatable nature of scientific experimentation, publi cation of findings in SP must ensure that all relevant details of the experiment must either be such as anyone can take for granted, like the sobriety of the experimenter, or spelled out, like the species of the rats chosen or the nature of the equipment used. Moreover, the description under which the problem to which the experiment is ad dressed must be unambiguous. To adapt and correct a claim of van Fraassen's (1980, p. 127), it is precisely because "Why did Adam eat the apple?" is a question of common sense and not of science that it allows for so many diverse explanations (Why Adam rather than Eve?; Why did he eat it rather than throw it?; Why an apple not a kiwi fruit?). It is precisely because "Why did the sample burn green?" is a question within science that it does not. An implication of all this is that there is a huge methodological difference between CSP and SP. Or, to put the point another way, CSP has and needs nothing deserving the name 'methodology'. SP has traditionally tried to aspire to the methodological rigour of the natural sciences, in part, I suppose, because so many of the German founding fathers of the discipline were trained as physiologists (cf., for instance, the two greatest figures - albeit working in very different SP fields - Wundt and Freud9) and physiology leaned so heavily on physics. But we can see this very clearly as far back as Hume, who aspired to be</page><page sequence="11">SCIENTIFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND COMMON-SENSE PSYCHOLOGY 25 "the Newton of the moral sciences". Compare J. S. Mill who wrote: "[t]he backward state of the moral sciences can only be remedied by applying to them the methods of Physical Sciences, duly extended and generalized" (1906, p. xv). It perhaps sometimes goes, or has gone, too far in this direction, binding itself into a straitjacket of unattainable methodological purity: The rejected child of drab philosophy and lowborn physiology, [psychology] has some times persuaded itself that actually it was the child of highborn physics. It identified with the aspirations of the physical sciences, and, consequently, acquired an idealized version of the parental image as a super-ego, especially concerning scientific morality, i.e., the 'right' way for a scientist to behave. (Watson 1973, p. 20) Moreover, many - Ebbinghaus is an early example - criticised the dominance of physics as a methodological superego. More recently, Lipsey has complained that when psychology emulates the physical sciences, it "resembles the duck that has imprinted on the football" (1974, p. 409). Nonetheless, large chunks of our current SP have achieved what they have achieved because of a deliberate attempt to emulate the methodological standards of better-established sciences; and CSP neither wants to, nor should, do this. To conclude this part of the discussion of the separation between CSP and SP: so far I have been accepting that CSP describes and explains (but not systematically). It is time to qualify this. It does, but it has a million other things to do besides description and explanation. Any attempt at a list would be inordinately long, and anyone could add to it, so I shall simply remind the reader of a few: joking, jeering, exhorting, discouraging, blaming, insulting, evaluating, advertising, hinting. The framework of CSP is a multi-purpose tool. The ambitions of science in general and SP in particular are to describe and explain systematically (where 'explain' should be taken often, at least, to in clude 'predict'). It has no other obligations: it is a single-purpose tool. This means that not only is CSP not a theory, it could never become one, and nobody should wish it to. There is a further difference, which is more profound and more contentious than what I have said so far (what I have said so far strikes me as obvious, but I must be wrong about this since so many disagree), and that is the different relationships that CSP and SP have to the neurosciences. CSP, bluntly, has no relationship whatsoever. The lay man has a vague belief that the brain, somehow, underpins psychologi</page><page sequence="12">26 KATHLEEN V. WILKES cal competence, but he can equally read Euripides' plays without being handicapped by the fact that Euripides probably had a vague belief that the heart, somehow, underpinned psychological competence. We have no difficulties when reading science-fictional stories about HAL in 2001: A Space Odessey, or fairy tales about talking rabbits, ice maidens, Galatea, or Pinocchio. It is hard to think of any neurophysio logical fact that could alter a comment made in CSP. (There is an interesting contrast here with common-sense medicine: the discoveries of scientists have indeed quite seriously affected people's attitudes to their bodies, their diet, and their exercise. Even though I do smoke, I think I shouldn't because of what medical science has discovered.) Of course, since CSP and SP are on a continuum, there are places in between. Consider, for instance, depression. CSP, without science, finds this puzzling, frustrating, something to try to talk the patient through. After the discovery that some forms of depression are closely correlated with a deficiency of catecholamine in the limbic system, these types of depression are less often regarded as something which falls into CSP and are, instead, treated by drugs. We shall return to this. The general point nevertheless holds: CSP is autonomous to a massive degree from the physiological. SP, I maintain, is not. This of course suggest an allegiance to some form of physicalism, and I am (independently) a physicalist. The burden of this point is best illustrated as follows. Even if we take a branch of SP that is currently being pursued independently, or largely indepen dently, of neuroscience (such as, for instance, the development of transitive reasoning in the young child), it is accepted that in principle neuroscientific discoveries could support or falsify the conjectures and explanations. Or, take a branch of psychology that is and will remain for a long time substantially independent of neurophysiology, Freudian psychoanalysis. This may or may not count as a scientific theory. Right now I do not need to come down on one side or the other of that debate. But if it is, then - as is very clear from Freud himself - two things follow. First, neuroscience will one day help to confirm, or maybe to refute, it. The early 'Project' (1895) shows this. Of course, Freud later disavowed the 'Project'. However, we find him writing as late as 1920 that it is possible that "[b]iology. . . will blow away the whole of our artificial structure of hypotheses" (1920 (1963), p. 60). Second, for the present psychoanalysis must carry on without reference to neuroscience. Both sciences need much more development before</page><page sequence="13">SCIENTIFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND COMMON-SENSE PSYCHOLOGY 27 one could be brought into kilter with the other. Developmental psychol ogy and psychoanalysis, although at present they pursue most of their research independently of the neurosciences, are nonetheless tied to them in the long run. Then, at the other extreme, of course, the study of such competences as visual perception have from the very start been conducted by psychology hand-in-hand with neuropsychology, which is in turn hand-in-hand with neurophysiology. But more about this later. As I have mentioned already, Freud studied biology, anatomy, neu roanatomy, medicine; and Wundt, the father of SP, studied physiology for seventeen years - part of the time under von Helmholtz - before creating the 'New Science' of SP. These are only the two most conspicu ous of the figures who, I suggest, have worked in SP and who simply take physicalism for granted. There are hundreds more. Later we shall see why SP must take it for granted. Whatever the contemporary reconstruction of SP by philosophers - which is coloured through and through by their Cartesian inheritance - those in laboratories and white coats have - unless they unwisely listen to the philosophers - regarded SP as an intrinsic and continuous part of the brain and behavioural sciences more generally. Right now, because this socio-historical claim is a separate subject and needs a separate paper, I am simply stating this. But I submit that the history of the science would fully bear out this contention. CSP, then, unlike SP, is not threatened or heartened by any advances in neuropsychology or neuroscience because it is cheerfully independent of them. This means that - in its eclectic manner - it can pick up whatever it wants from scientific theories, and generally of course (be cause it is the psychology of the layman) prefers to pick up terms and ideas that are trendy enough to get discussed in glossy magazines. So, someone can be described as 'having an Oedipal complex', a once trendy way of saying that he is fond of his mother. Strident feminists can be insulted by accusing them of 'penis envy'. Needless to say, terms such as 'Oepidal complex' and 'penis envy' are used in CSP very loosely, in a manner that infuriates psychoanalysts concerned with the scientific status of their discipline. But, for the reasons given above, CSP does not want to use terms with strict definitions, and instead 'woolifies' them to give them the flexibility needed if they are to be, say, ad equately insulting for the purpose at hand. Such terms and phrases will persist for just as long as they are thought to serve some function and will be dropped when or if they fall out of fashion. At the same time</page><page sequence="14">28 KATHLEEN V. WILKES CSP has a m?lange of terms that derive from ancient views about the heart ("I believe it with all my heart"), from the dominance of the 'theatre model' of mind ('introspection', "in my mind's eye"), from the idea of the mind as a spatial entity ("weighing on my mind", "at the back of my mind"), from phrenology ("I have no bump of direction"). No doubt some terms from computer technology will soon join the brew. There is no more point in indicting some claims drawn from this unholy mix as being false than there is any point in criticising someone who says that he is "in two minds" on the grounds that he has not undergone commissurotomy, or who says that "my heart went out to him" on the grounds that he has had no heart transplant. This brings this section to a head and to a close. Since CSP is not a theory, and since it has no evidential tie to what goes on in the brain or in the heart, questions of truth or falsity (or, at least, truth by correspondence; the all-pervading holism of the mental would allow us to affirm or deny truth by coherence of individual ascriptions) rarely arise. Indeed, the debate between realism and instrumentalism does not really arise. Since it is not a theory, bits of it might need to be construed realistically ("I really have an agonising pain in my toe") and other bits instrumentalistically ("I gave him a piece of my mind"), but with the vast majority the issue is not clear enough to be posed ("I stumbled at the top because I thought there was another step"; "that idiot dog thinks the cat is still up that tree").10 Since it isn't a theory, none of this matters a hap'orth, any more than it matters a hap'orth for that clich? that there are no hap'orths left. 2. IMPLICATIONS I want to highlight four implications of all this. First, the mind-body problem. There is no such problem for CSP. Those using CSP probably mostly think that the mind is realised by the brain; most sensible laymen are not dualists. Sometimes, too, individual mental events (such as occurrent pains, thoughts that run through the head) need a realist construal; after all, they have temporal parameters, and pains are also located. And then, one might idly speculate that there may be some token-token identity with, or instantiation by, neural events 'going on in there'. This is strictly parallel to looking at a fountain pen and wondering idly just what exact structure its atomic lattice has. It has some such structure, sure. Other thoughts might not tempt even</page><page sequence="15">SCIENTIFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND COMMON-SENSE PSYCHOLOGY 29 so idle a speculation; ascription of some thoughts to people might be more like the familiar ascription to a chess-playing computer, "it wants to get its queen out early". "Really?" - "Yes and no: it depends on what you mean by 'really'". Then, there is in the middle a third category, where terms in CSP do, as a matter of fact, coincide closely or roughly with terms that are in fact natural kind terms (in the sense sketched above). For example, let us suppose, 'headaches', or certain forms of depression. Here CSP might be referring to phenomena that do indeed correlate systematically with states and processes identified by neuropsychologists or neurophysiologists - more of a type-type re lation. But if so, then by accident, just as it is an accident (as far as the layman is concerned) that although both fences and gold interest us on occasion, the latter but not the former also happens to be an object of systematic scientific scrutiny. The point here is that absorb ability-into-science is not a prerequisite for CSP to be valid and valu able. But SP does not genuinely have a mind-body problem either. This is because it begs the question from the start by assuming physicalism. The object is to identify and describe the competences characteristic of humans or of other animals, and to try to discover how the brain and Central Nervous System are organised to explain these competences. Note, it is not 'and then to try': there is no preferred direction-of explanation here. In other words, I am not, and most of those in laboratories and white coats are not, enrolled among the 'top down' theorists. Research can enter the game at any one of the numerous levels that characterise the brain and behavioural sciences. That is, one can work exclusively at the 'top', for instance, studying the development of transitive reasoning. Or, one can take on board the question of the differences in psychological competence between the two hemispheres of the human brain. Or, one can consider the hippocampus as a cogni tive map, or the amygdala as the 'comparator', which compares incom ing with expected stimuli. Or, one can examine the role of the network of neurons in the cerebellum, or cell-columns in the visual cortex that react to input from vertical lines. Or, of course, one can look at the dynamics and biochemistry of individual nerve cells. Work at all levels is required and is undertaken. Just as in other sciences, the explanation at one level of a phenomenon at a slightly higher level - explaining, for instance, what it is about the amygdala that allows it to compare incoming with expected stimuli - may refine and redefine the original</page><page sequence="16">30 KATHLEEN V. WILKES explanandum. Or, to take a more macro example, it was primarily neuropsychological and neurosurgical work that showed conclusively that it is a mistake to consider memory as a single competence at the psychological level. So we can see how inevitable it is that SP must beg the question against dualism. Explananda are proposed by a higher level; this gives the next level down its marching-orders, a target. Explananda propose, but the explanantia dispose, by (perhaps) forcing a redescription of the target explanandum. Conversely, those working at lower levels find patterns, regularities, and networks, which demand to be pulled in to a higher-level account. Those studying pure alexia found, among other things, a surprising disjunction: pure alexics can write, but cannot read. The implications for the higher level: maybe reading and writing com petences are not as closely interlocked as might have been thought, and maybe the description of the holism of psychological competences such as these needs rewriting. The implications for neurophysiology: How can this be? Just how, and why, do these two capacities become disengaged? If the next level down can't handle the explanandum proposed by a higher level at all, then the suspicion is eventually bound to arise that the target explanandum is the psychological equivalent of a fence, rather than gold, and is not a genuine phenomenon for systematic study. Put very bluntly, if it cannot be handled within the driving presupposition of systematic physicalism, then it is not a genuine part of SP. The question is most thoroughly begged. This interlocking re lationship has been described by P. S. Churchland as a 'coevolution' of psychology and neuroscience. I agree, but with the hefty reservation that it is not a coevolution of two theories; it is a coevolution of numer ous levels of description within the mind/brain. It simply does not matter, except for bureaucratic purposes, what bits of it are called - whether it be psychology, neuropsychology, psychophysics, physiologi cal psychology, psychophysiology, or neurophysiology - just so long as the scientists know in what building they can find their offices. So that's the end of the mind-body problem! Second, CSP is superb, I have claimed; but we now must assess its most resounding weakness. Simply put: it cannot handle irrational, abnormal, aberrant behaviour; it has never been able to. The reason it succeeds as it does is because it aims to show how the behaviour to be explained is, given the background, the circumstances, the rest of</page><page sequence="17">SCIENTIFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND COMMON-SENSE PSYCHOLOGY 31 the agent's holistic web of psychological states, rationally intelligible after all. We have to approach the explanation of behaviour and the ascription of psychological states with what has been called a 'principle of rationality', or a 'principle of humanity'. What counts as an explana tion is something which shows how, despite appearances, it is after all rational for this agent to behave so oddly. I shall not run through these arguments, which are adequately familiar. Unsurprisingly, then, weakness of will and self-deception have throughout the history of the philosophy of mind remained as unsolved problems. For example, in my judgement Davidson's discussion of akrasia (1969) is more technically sophisticated than Aristotle's in the Nicomachean Ethics, but I don't find it any better. Just as unsurpris ingly, Homer's account of why his heroes behaved irrationally fails to satisfy us now because abnormal behaviour was explained by the gods temporarily clouding the judgement of one warrior, or putting inexplic able terror into another. And so today we reject the Homeric pantheon. But consider how we understand the gods' behaviour: they took sides in the battle, and had favourites, and so they were being thoroughly rational when clouding Agamemnon's judgement. (He stole Achilles' slave girl, so Achilles sulked in his tent, which removed the world heavyweight from the scene; and so the Trojans temporarily triumphed over the Greeks.) In other words, human irrationality was explained via a higher, indeed divine, rationality. In the Middle Ages inexplicable behaviour was often explained by the malign or benign, but again rationally intelligible, purposes of demons, witches, warlocks. Now we have Freud. But his enterprise is to show how, given the genesis of ideas in the 'System Ucs', we can see how if an agent thought this, feared that, longed for the other etc., then of course he would wash his hands 2,000 times a day. Perfectly sensible, really, given the circum stances in which the ego finds itself. The anthropomorphism, at least in the more popularising works, given to what Asher has nicely called "those shady Middle European refugees - the Ego, the Super Ego and the Id" (1972, p. 36), reminds one irresistibly of the battle of the gods that distorted the behaviour of the Iliadic heroes. The reason why CSP is so penetrating, then - because it can show how prima facie puzzling actions are rationally intelligible after all - is equally the explanation of its failure to explain the irrational. Can SP do any better? Yes, at least in principle, because of its connections with the neurosci</page><page sequence="18">32 KATHLEEN V. WILKES optic chiasm speech regions left visual cortex (destroyed in pure alexia) corpus callosum sensory and motor regions splenium ( destroyed in pure alexia ) right visual cortex Fig. 1. enees. I am not, of course, suggesting that SP has explained weakness of will or self-deception. But two examples, both already briefly men tioned, will illustrate the sort of thing I have in mind. One is very straightforward. Pure alexia must trouble CSP. It does not make sense that someone who can write, recognise almost all everyday objects (often including written numbers), sort and match colour chips, tell you the colour of blood, the sky or grass, nevertheless, cannot recognise letters or words, or tell you what colour a painted colour chip is. This is not rationally intelligible. But there is a wholly satisfactory explanation. Very crudely, there is a brain lesion which destroys the left visual cortex and a part of the great cerebral commissure called the splenium, which provides the direct link from the right visual regions to the language centres in the left hemisphere.11 So visual input, if it is to get to the language centres (and so get identified verbally) must travel by indirect routes. Something like a hammer has connections with the motor cortex and the auditory cortex (we pick up, and bang, hammers). So a seen hammer will arouse associations in auditory and motor regions of the right hemisphere. From there, from those connections, the infor mation can travel by intact commissural paths - i.e., not via the splen ium - to the language centres. Colours, though, and letters, rarely have non-visual associations; and so if the direct (splenium) route to the language centres is cut, there is no other. Numbers are often learned,</page><page sequence="19">SCIENTIFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND COMMON-SENSE PSYCHOLOGY 33 initially, by counting on one's fingers, so they may get recognised because the information can travel indirectly, via the motor cortex's intact commissural links with the left hemisphere's language centres. Q.E.D. This fully explains.12 It is not a rational explanation, but it has removed the need to provide one. Pure alexia is no longer puzzling for CSP, any more than the failure of a favourite to win a race is puzzling when we hear that the horse had a hairline fracture in a hoof. Now consider depression. It is hard for CSP to understand depression if the patient seems to have nothing special to be depressed about. But at least some forms of depression are systematically correlated with a deficiency of catecholamine in the limbic system. However there are higher level SP theories, such as, Seligman's 1975 account in terms of 'learned helplessness'. Between these two we certainly find a looming gap. Seligman's account tries to make rational sense of depression - to show how the phenomenon is intelligible, given a specific type of his tory. The biochemical account is far lower down the hierarchy and makes no reference to rational intelligibility. My optimistic proposal is that when or if we find out more about the role of the limbic system and catecholamine, and the sorts of effects the system and the substance have upon other functions of the brain, then we would be getting closer to a mixed psychophysiological account which would answer both the demand on SP to show how behaviour can be rationally understood and provide a partial explanation of it in non-rational (not irrational) terms. I agree that at present this is optimistic hand-waving. But it shows the sort of direction along which SP can in principle proceed when confronted with what CSP just cannot explain at all, abnormal or irrational behaviour. Third, I want to mention briefly my rejection (which is unlikely to convince) of so-called philosophical psychology. By this I mean the sorts of theories - whether of action, perception, or whatever - created by philosophers in armchairs rather than by scientists in laboratories, namely, theoretical elaborations of CSP. Sometimes they are not so much imagined as attacked. P. M. Churchland, for example, believes that CSP gives us 'theories of action' which are well-entrenched but false. P. S. Churchland believes that we operate in CSP with a 'senten tial paradigm' that is 'dinky', misleading, and, again, false. I am sure that many philosophers have produced theories which fall to both these sorts of criticism. But CSP itself does not.</page><page sequence="20">34 KATHLEEN V. WILKES Such theories respect the constraints of 'real' theorising to the extent that they come up with a stripped-down vocabulary. Consider, for instance, Davidson (1963) talking about two sources of action: beliefs and pro-attitudes. Others constructing, reconstructing, or criticising, such 'theories' produce alleged 'laws' of CSP, such as, 'If X fears that P, and discovers that not-P, then X is pleased' (or more sophisticated versions, each with its essential protective shield of ceteris paribus/ab sentibus conditions). All such theories make several hefty presuppositions. They assume that the explananda provided by CSP are amenable to systematic expla nation (which I do not believe for a moment). But further, they assume that actions are caused (I believe this); that beliefs and desires explain actions (I believe this, too, at least to some extent); and that beliefs and desires explain actions by causing them (this needs, but never gets, defence, and I myself do not believe it). Hence, their need to devise theories which have law-like relations between beliefs and desires, and behaviour. It should already be clear, from the first section, why I think that such armchair theories cannot get off the ground, and so I shall not go over that again - the root cause is simple, in that CSP simply is not a theory at all. Now I only want to pose a question to those either propounding, or assuming and then attacking, such theories: they have my 'mind-mind' problem. Just what is their relationship meant to be with the theories produced by empirical work? More specifically, what connection does a CSP term like 'belief have to the terms postulated by scientists to account for the processing - different forms of processing for different kinds of input - of information, its storage, retrieval, etc.? Why, too, is there no parallel in other domains; why, that is, are there no common-sense theories (in a full-blooded sense of 'theory') in physics or chemistry? In the older and better-established sciences, no body dreams of inventing 'philosophical theories' such as 'philosophical chemistry'. I am very confused about what the theories of philosophers are trying to do. Are they bringing some order into the chaotic and intricate web of CSP? But CSP, to borrow from a remark of Hamp shire's, is like a plate of spaghetti. What makes something a good pasta meal is the intricacy of the interlocking of numerous strands and the way the sauce weaves in and out. The philosophical theorists, to my mind, seem to be trying to burrow into the plate and to pull out a few crucial strands, to lay them side by side and wipe the sauce off them,</page><page sequence="21">SCIENTIFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND COMMON-SENSE PSYCHOLOGY 35 and then describe the result. Whatever else that is, it would be a bad meal; and it is not a syst?matisation of CSP. Insofar as it is a theory, it is a bad one because its empirical base is inadequate. What the spaghetti of CSP allows and invites is a description of the plate as it is, and that, I take it, is the task of the philosophy of mind. These theories, then, lose what is interesting about CSP while failing to attain what works (at least to some extent) in SP. Fourth, I would like to discuss the implication of what I see as the inaccuracy of the 'reconstructions' of SP produced by philosophical psychologists. The 'psychological' is heterogeneous; so heterogeneous that as we have seen what counts as psychology, neuropsychology, and neurophysiology is no more than a trivially verbal question. The theo ries devised or attacked by philosophers ignore this heterogeneity and attempt to impose a single model on CSP and SP alike (which in general they conflate), or else to assume that they have one. Thus, we have P.S. Churchland saying that CSP is driven by an alleged 'sentential model'. I suspect that she has been reading too much Fodor, a CSP theorist. Such models are, as she insists, feeble because they drive dramatic divisions between 'cognitive' tasks (which can be modelled on digital computers) and all else, which mostly can't - PDP (paralled distributed processing, or connectionism) modelling looks much more promising here. As she rightly insists, this is too narrow: it is essential to the understanding of most so-called cognitive tasks that we take on board such competences as sensory-motor control. Equally, it is part of the task of psychology to examine: pain; emotions; sexual desire; face recognition; the way baby birds learn their song; why dunnocks and reed-warblers in particular fail to kick parasitic cuckoo eggs from their nests, in contrast to more sensible birds; the mobbing behaviour of chaffinches; Korsakoff's syndrome; alcoholism. P.S. Churchland would not disagree with this, indeed, she wants to emphasise it; and no doubt all of these phenomena will need to incorporate some strands from what is now called cognitive psychology. My quarrel with her is that she is not talking about the nitty-gritty, nose-to-the-grindstone, work of SP; and, equally, what she says does not hold for CSP. The scientists and the laymen alike have always, and routinely, been talking of a far richer and more diverse field than has the relatively recent Artificial Intelligence (AI), or cognitive science, community. I hinted earlier, and was only exaggerating mildly, that sensible psychologists get on with their job better if they do not heed the</page><page sequence="22">36 KATHLEEN V. WILKES reconstructions of the philosophers. Fortunately, by and large, they do not. But they can be made uneasy for two reasons. First, there are the philosophers, pestering them to impose a single model (whether it is Descartes's exclusion of all non-conscious mentality and, hence, Hume's theatre model of mind; or Watson's telephone exchange model of mind; or the computer model - serial or parallel as the case may be). Second, there is the prestige of physics combined with SP's desire for scientific respectability. Physics, as R. I. Watson put it, is a sort of superego of the other sciences and, unless you are a practising physicist, you will distort the superego exactly as Freud describes and come up with a wholly unrealistic set of norms to which psychology should try to subscribe. Given a distorted impression of the purity of physics, impressionable psychologists have thought that they should have a single model, a single methodology: that (perhaps) the 'top down' strategy of computational AI is indeed, as Fodor says somewhere, 'the only ball-game in town'. If, however, physics were to be seen in its true colours - as an extremely impressive and successful, but also highly heterogeneous, mess, with literally hundreds of models, methodologies, strategies; with explananda drawn from all levels of descriptions13 - then it could indeed serve as a benign superego for contemporary SP. For instance, psychol ogy need not worry that few of its laws are as strict and exceptionless as are some laws of physics, when it reflects on (say) qualitative mechan ics. It should firmly abjure the search for single models and single methodologies when it looks at virtually any part of physics. Above all, though, it could and should take a more detached view of its relation ship to CSP. SP and CSP are not unrelated, any more than the cook's concern when creating a new recipe is unrelated to what chemistry has to say; contemporary physics and mechanics are heavily exploited when new buildings are put up (tell that, though, to the Greeks, Romans, and medievals, whose buildings have a rather more impressive track record than ours). SP has the particular problem that CSP, in its do main, is vastly more sophisticated than SP has so far been in its (differ ent) domain. But we have seen some of the reasons for that.14 NOTES 1 The 'encephalization quotient' (EQ) juggles brain weight and body weight in an ill disguised attempt to find a formula that brings man out ahead of the other animals.</page><page sequence="23">SCIENTIFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND COMMON-SENSE PSYCHOLOGY 37 EQ = EtlkP"; where Et is the real brain size, P is body weight, and k and a are designer constants. 2 Greek plays were performed with the players wearing masks, so Dennett's example of a smile won't work there. But mutatis mutandis the point still holds, since any gesture or intonation would serve my purposes as well as a smile. 3 The two places where I have argued for this most explicitly are in Inquiry 1984 and 1986. 4 The problem, for contemporary SP, can scarcely be exaggerated. Few agree - to take just one example - how best to describe memory. The preferred taxonomies ranges from 2 to 22 'types' of memory; and the categories are very various: short term, medium term, long term; 'scratch-pad'; procedural and declarative; semantic; episodic; iconic; non-cognitive; somatic; and so on. The diversity of 'memory' is emphasised by the corresponding diversity in types of memory-loss: different ailments (e.g., Korsakoff's, Huntington's, Alzheimer's, various head injuries) produce characteristically variant dis turbances of memory. Unfortunately very many more examples of highly central SP concepts could be cited - one of the trendiest, and most disputed, is that of a 'representa tion'. Nestle (1982) has a study in which eleven prominent psychologists failed to agree on what work in psychology counted as 'important'. 5 This point is forcefully made in a widely-neglected book (or, at least, neglected, by philosophers) by Mandler and Kessen (1959). 6 I join the majority in dating the beginning of SP to Wilhelm Wundt, with his 'new science' and the world's first laboratory of psychology in Leipzig. 7 This needs to be qualified. On the 'moving frontier of science', we frequently find concepts that are vague and unclear when first introduced. 'Field' and 'spacetime' are two examples which, as Newton-Smith (1981) has pointed out, were attacked for their obscurity initially, but which then allowed for - indeed, made possible - just those experiments by means of which they were, or are, being refined and clarified. My point is merely that science aims at precise and well-defined concepts. 8 Even so, such observations often attract charges (sometimes fair charges) of being 'merely anecdotal'. 9 I am not (here) committing myself to a judgement on the question of whether Freudian theory should count as a science. Probably not; but Freud knew well what genuine science required, and struggled hard to make his theory fit the pattern. 10 Here my version of CSP instrumentalism differs from that of Dennett - at least I think so. But I find his instrumentalism hard to follow - as I think does Stich. See Stich 1983, ch. 11. 11 Most, but not all, people (including left-handers) have language capacity primarily in the left hemisphere. Pure alexia would take the converse form in that small percentage who have it specialised in the right hemisphere: the damage to the visual cortex would have to be to the left side. A very few have hemispheres equipotent for language. If the hypothesis is correct, it should be impossible to find pure alexia with them. 12 Note that this hypothesis is also testable. Pure alexics should be unable to name other 'purely visual' objects, such as clouds, on sight alone; conversely, patients who had learned their letters in childhood by playing manually with letter-shapes should be able to recognise letters, even if not words. 13 Nancy Cartwright (1983) has decisively shown the extent to which much successful physics is a 'guess-and-by-golly', 'muddle-through' matter whereby numerous models,</page><page sequence="24">38 KATHLEEN V. WILKES often technically incompatible with each other, have their own roles to play within parts of the science, and in which 'strict' laws often play a far less significant explanatory role than do what she calls 'phenomenal' laws, and variously-fudged approximations. 14 An earlier version of this paper ran the gamut of presentation at universities in Ontario, the University of Warwick, the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences in Moscow, and the 8th Inter-Nordic Philosophical Symposium in Oslo. I am very grateful for the comments and criticisms it received on these occasions. REFERENCES Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics. Asher, R.: 1972, Talking Sense, Pitman Books Ltd., London.
