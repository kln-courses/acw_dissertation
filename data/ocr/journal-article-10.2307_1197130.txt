<plain_text><page sequence="1">ENERGY THE SOUL OF MATTER OLIVER L. REISER University of Pittsburgh I. BODY AND SOUL T IS a curious fact that man insists upon asking himself questions which he cannot answer. Man thus appears as an enigma to himself, a cosmic question mark amidst a world of facts. Today, no less than in the age of Job, the ques- tion insistently is asked, What is man? Is he indeed so wonder- fully made that we can with certainty answer in the affirmative the query of Job, If a man die shall he live again? It is common knowledge that one of the oldest solutions to that riddle is presented in what is now termed the "interaction- istic" theory of human nature. This dualistic solution-a view which alone seems to justify current religious teachings concern- ing the immortality of the soul-is so widely accepted among the laity that it involves but little exaggeration to state that only those who have become philosophically sophisticated by the study of science in our modernistic universities have come to despise this classical explanation of human experience and conduct. It is the purpose of the present paper to criticize the dualistic theory and suggest an alternative doctrine. But first we must understand the reasons put forth in support of the view. Ac- cordingly we will first glance at one classical defense of the view, the doctrine of Plato as it is expounded by his spokesman, Socrates. In the Phaedo Socrates is discussing with others a point of view which, after examination, he rejects, but which appears to me to be one of the most satisfactory of the various proposed solutions to this problem. The explanation which Soc- rates abandons is the idea that the soul is the harmony of the body. It will be remembered that Pythagoras, who saw in num- 61</page><page sequence="2">62 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION ber patterns and numerical ratios the explanation of all natural phenomena, and who also made discoveries concerning the mathematical basis of musical harmony, had presented the musical scale which was later to develop into the generally accepted scale. It is clear, therefore, that the facts concerning the relation between the lengths of vibrating strings and the corresponding tones which they give forth were known to Py- thagoras. Accordingly it was to be expected that some theo- rizer acquainted with the ideas of this philosopher-scientist would suggest the idea that what is called the "soul" is com- parable to musical harmony. In the Phaedo the body is com- pared to a lyre: just as the lyre has strings of varying lengths, so the human body has strings set in its frame. Both produce a compound which is harmonious when there is a proper admix- ture of parts. Harmony, as Plato puts it, is a thing invisible, incorporeal, divine, abiding in the lyre which is harmonized- though the strings are matter, composite and earthly. This view, attractive as it is, is rejected by Socrates, who, destined to drink the cup which is to immortalize him, is interested in finding a theory providing something more than social immor- tality. And so Socrates (or Plato) spurns this view, and finds three reasons for doing so. In the first place, harmony in music is not prior to the elements which compose the harmony. If the soul be simply the harmony of the body, the soul cannot exist prior to or after the instrument of which it is the harmony. But Socrates is not willing to grant that the soul perishes with the body. Plato and Socrates, like other Greek philosophers, favor the doctrine of the transmigration of the soul. A second reason which Socrates finds for discarding this view is found in the fact that the harmony does not lead the parts which make up the harmony, but only follows them. To quote Plato's words: " ... . the soul, being a harmony, can never utter a note at variance with the tensions and relaxations and vibrations and other affections of the strings out of which she is composed; she can only follow, she cannot lead them." But</page><page sequence="3">ENERGY THE SOUL OF MATTER 63 Socrates then argues that we actually discover the soul doing the exact opposite-leading the elements of which, by this theo- ry, she is supposed to be composed. The soul is always opposing and coercing the body. (For Plato matter, when it is not thought of as illusory and unreal, is conceived to be a principle of opposition-something dumb and recalcitrant.) Undoubted- ly it is this feeling of coercing the body against its own inclina- tions, the feeling of a struggle against the "lower" desires of the "flesh," which lends plausibility to the dualism of soul and body. We find this interpretation implied in Paul's observation that the things he ought to do he does not, and the things he ought not to do he does. This sense of a conflict of a higher and a lower nature leads him to declare that there is a body spiritual and a body material. This conflict is real, and any theory which pretends to explain all the facts must provide a basis for that type of conduct. Freud has attempted to explain this inhibiting power of the soul by the notion of the "psychic censor." Un- fortunately he has not told us how this deus ex machina goes about its work. The view which is here proposed is that this struggle is not a conflict between the soul and the body, but be- tween the desires of special or segmental bodily cravings and the total momentum of the body as it is integrated into a uni- fied whole. The final reason why Socrates rejects this view lies in the fact that harmony admits of degrees, whereas the soul does not. According to Socrates we cannot admit that one person is more or less a soul than another person. This view follows from the definition of the soul as a thing which is simple, indivisible, and not composed of parts. By way of reply, and in defense of the view that the soul is the harmony of the body, we must insist that our definitions should not be asserted on a priori grounds but must be devised to fit the facts. The fact is that the soul is not simple and indivisible. We know too much of multiple or split personalities to affirm that the soul may not consist of parts. Also, the soul admits of degrees. We can speak of some</page><page sequence="4">64 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION persons as having more or less of a soul than others. And the test of the degree of soul life is a question of wealth and variety of interests or richness of content of integrated experience. In the view which Plato and Socrates defend we clearly have before us a dualistic theory of the relation of soul and body. In contemporary psychology this view that the mind coerces the body is termed the doctrine of "ideo-motor action." Ideas are said to be dynamogenic in the control of conduct. Such a view corresponds to the parallel doctrine in biology which is known as "vitalism." As the reader knows, in modern science these views are much criticized. The history of science illustrates the truth of the statement that in its earlier stages science always involves an animistic or vitalistic view, and that as time goes on science tends to become more and more mechanistic in char- acter. Since we will be discussing these two contrasting views at some length, it will be well for us to define the sense in which we shall understand the terms "mechanism" and "vitalism." By a mechanical or mechanistic view we will mean the doc- trine which holds that any reality of nature is nothing but the material structures or units out of which it is made. By a vi- talistic theory we will mean that doctrine which holds that the functions and modes of behavior of any specified reality of nature cannot be explained entirely in terms of the material units or elements into which it can be analyzed. Function cannot be reduced to structure. But if what a thing does is not to be ex- plained by its structure, what, then, is its explanation? Vitalism always involves the assertion that what a thing or an organism does is caused by some agency or force of coercion which acts upon the configuration of material elements. This force or ac- tive principle is capable of separation from the structure through which it functions or expresses itself. In this way of stating the matter it is evident that vitalism is not a term restricted solely to biology. You may have a vitalistic physics as well as a vita- listic biology or vitalistic psychology. It is important to keep in mind that vitalism, no matter in what field it appears, always</page><page sequence="5">ENERGY THE SOUL OF MATTER 65 involves a dualism. It asserts that matter or body is inactive, inert, and passive, and that the cause of the active functioning of matter or body is the force or agency behind body. Matter or body, in this view, is that which is acted upon by forces. 2. THE TRADITIONAL DUALISMS The oldest of these dualisms is that which is presented by the antithesis between soul and body. This dualism appears in the speculations of primitive philosophers. Obviously it is what is termed "psychological dualism." Later on, when the biologist had arrived at the notion of the "physical basis of life" there appears the dualism of protoplasm and life (or the vital force). This is a biological dualism. The corresponding opposition in physics is the antithesis between matter and energy. It is diffi- cult to state just when these dualisms first appeared in human thought, but they are all present in Greek philosophy four or five centuries before the birth of Christ. These dualisms still exist. But before going farther let us set down these contrasts so that we have them before us: Matter and Energy (or Force).....in physics Protoplasm and Life ...........in biology Body and Mind (or Soul)......... in psychology In order to weigh the truth and the merits of the views of nature which are given in the mechanistic and the vitalistic explana- tions we must first understand what the motives are which lead to the oppositions in the foregoing types of vitalisms. At the present time we hear much of the conflict between science and religion and science and poetry, or, more generally, the conflict between the mechanistic and the idealistic attitudes toward nature. In early thought this conflict did not exist be- cause these distinctions in interest and points of view were not yet established. Science, religion, and philosophy were united in primitive thought. The conflict first appears when the theory of matter embodied in classical materialism is presented. It is only when science develops as an independent interest, freed</page><page sequence="6">66 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION from the bondage to religion and mythology, that theories of matter appear which provide no place for the vital forces of the animistic system. And when the notion of matter is thus de- vitalized so that body is so conceived as to be incapable of spon- taneously initiating change it then becomes necessary to find in some extraneous force which acts upon matter the generative principle of motion and development. If this is true it follows that the development of physics, with the concomitant tend- ency toward the increasing mechanization of matter, has con- tributed in no small measure to the growth of vitalism in all fields. The assumption which is implicitly made, and which seems to make it necessary to introduce vital forces, is the no- tion that rest is more natural than motion. But why, we may ask, should this assumption become incorporated into historical materialism? Why should we have defined our conceptions of matter in such a way that if a thing is changing or in motion we must suppose that some sort of force or agency is responsible for that activity? Perhaps the answer to this question is that we human beings are naturally lazy. Therefore we cannot understand why anything else in nature should exhibit activity unless "forced" to do it because we ourselves do not do any- thing unless we are "compelled" to do it. This explanation of why rest should appear more "natural" than motion probably has some truth in it. However, I think it is unjustifiably ex- aggerating the slothfulness of human nature. I should prefer to rephrase the statement in this fashion: The notion that rest is more natural than motion, and hence that moving bodies must be acted upon by coercing forces, is not so much a consequence of the laziness of human beings as it is a consequence of intro- spectively noting the fact that when we do move external ob- jects there is always present a conscious sense of effort. It is now rather generally agreed that this sense of effort, the sense of muscle strain when lifting or pushing external bodies, is the origin of our notion that when bodies move they are acted upon by forces from without. Thus, as we have seen in the pre-</page><page sequence="7">ENERGY THE SOUL OF MATTER 67 vious chapter, the notion in physics of force is an anthropomor- phism. It is the result of a projection into nature of our own sense of effort. This is evident from the fact that in every case of the foregoing dualisms the second term of the antithesis is the active cause which overcomes the inertia of inactive bodies. Inertia here .means the tendency for a thing to continue doing what it has been doing--or failing to do. We have already noted the way in which this idea appears in Plato. It may help us to understand the psychology of a dualistic view if we also glance at the way in which this same notion that motion is not natural (i.e., self-explanatory) appears in Aristotle. What is the cause of motion? In answer to this question we ordinarily point to some antecedently operating force which is believed to produce the given motion. But we can always find another antecedent state or cause which preceded our original cause. Are we therefore compelled to admit that the cause of any given state was the preceding state, and that this state in turn had its antecedent state, and so on ad infinitum? If so, we must admit that motion is eternal, and that there is no first cause of motion, since motion never had an absolute beginning. But rather than admit the possibility of an infinite regress, which really leaves motion unexplained, Aristotle argues that we must stop somewhere, and this absolute beginning or first cause of motion he states is God. We must have an eternal Un- moved Mover who is the ground of all subsequent motions and developments, but himself is unmoved and unchangeable. Hence God for Aristotle is that being in terms of which every- thing else is explained, but who himself is forever inexplicable. This argument of Aristotle's is one of the classical proofs for the existence of God. As an explanation of the origin of motion it still appeals to many minds. It is easy to understand the way in which the doctrine of relativity cuts under this argument. By introducing the notion of the relativity of motion Einstein removes the last vestige of the notion of force as a cause. By insisting upon the relativity</page><page sequence="8">68 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION of time measurements Einstein abolishes the notion of absolute beginnings. Finally, by showing that we cannot separate the containing vessels of space and time from the content, which is matter, the relativist completely removes the foundations which support the idea that matter and its motions could have origi- nated at some time in the past. That is to say, the world could have had a beginning only if time and space could exist even though there were no matter "in" these containers. But we now know that time and space are not the containers of matter, and that if there were no matter time and space would cease to exist. Hence it is nonsense to talk about absolute beginnings or first causes of motions, if by this we mean that matter and mo- tion appeared at some specific date in the past of a temporal series which was flowing along long before the universe was. But these are very recent ideas, and thinkers of earlier ages could not avoid the errors which the theory of relativity now makes evident to us. Hence it is easy for us to understand why, once the idea was established that the motions of bodies require forces for their explanation, it was natural that philosophers and scientists should introduce these active principles ab extra to explain each new level of behavior or each realm of functional activity. Those who were responsible for these previously-mentioned types of dualism had noted the following levels of functional activity: (a) the difference between matter at rest and matter in motion; (b) between inanimate bodies and living matter or protoplasm; and (c) between conscious human beings and un- conscious living forms (such as plants). Since the activities of each of these levels called for a distinct kind of cause, the follow- ing types of forces or causes were invoked: (i) Energy, as that which causes and directs the motions of inanimate matter; (2) life, as that which causes and directs the motions of organ- isms; and (3) mind or soul, as that which produces and directs the motions of human beings. In each case the active cause is responsible for the behavior of the material complex upon which it acts. Each new type of behavior is explained by the introduc-</page><page sequence="9">ENERGY THE SOUL OF MATTER 69 tion of a new entity or force. This type of explanation is a con- sequence of the inveterate tendency of our reasoning processes to make entities out of modes of behavior. This process of hy- postatizing or reifying functions so that they are the expression of indwelling and imponderable forces is illustrated in primitive man's explanation of insanity, headaches, and disease as being due to the presence of some external entity, spirit, or force in the individual who is thus obsessed. The practice of casting out devils, and the surgery now called "trepanning" which primi- tive man resorted to to provide an opening in the skull through which the inclosed spirit might escape, illustrate the practical effects of this type of explanation. This type of explanation is also illustrated in the early history of chemistry, where all sorts of caloric fluids and phlogistons were injected into matter to explain its chemical behavior. Now that we have a thumb-nail sketch of the historical development of our problem before us we must next ask our- selves what we can do to resolve this dispute between the mechanists and the vitalists. By way of a beginning let us raise the question of whether these are the only choices before us-or is there another possible point of view, a tertium quid, which we have not stated? Those of my readers who have followed recent discussion know that the movement popularized under the term "emergent evolution" is held by its advocates to provide an escape from the two horns of the vitalistic-mechanistic dilemma. And the defenders of the doctrine known as gestalt-psychology also claim that. their view disposes of the old antithesis. These doctrines are mentioned merely to show that it is not neces- sarily a question of choosing either mechanism or vitalism-we may reject both if we wish. This we propose to do in the view which is now outlined in its gross features. 3. STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION In the traditional dualism which we have just examined it is evident that the terms of the three antitheses involve an oppo- sition between that which is acted upon and that which pro-</page><page sequence="10">70 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION duces the action. We have, in other words, a dualism of sub- stance or matter on the one hand, and of force or activity on the other. It is my contention that the materialist emphasizes the structural or substantial aspects of the reality which he studies, while the vitalist emphasizes the functional or activity aspect of this reality. That is to say, the dualism of substance (or matter) and action (caused by force) is but a special case of the dualism of structural and functional. It seems to me that even more fundamental than the dualism of mind and body, of life and protoplasm, of energy and matter, is the dualism of the static (or structural) and dynamic (or func- tional) aspects of nature. It is our belief that this ubiquitous dualism of the structural and the functional has its origin in the dualism of space and time. In other words, the thesis here pre- sented is that energy, life, and mind are designations of the dynamic, functional, or temporal aspects of realities of which matter, protoplasm, or body are the static, structural, or mate- rial designations. Life and mind, standing as they do for the functional aspects, are therefore to be regarded as forms of time or temporal organization. In the words of the great British philosopher, S. Alexander, "time is the mind of space." When- ever any structural complex or configuration of material ele- ments is so unified into a dynamically integrated whole that we have what I shall variously call a "unitary mode of behavior" or a "macroscopic rhythm," there mind is present. Mind or soul, therefore, is not a gift from on high; it is an achievement by organisms. In place of metaphysical forces invoked to explain the various levels of behavior in nature we must, then, substi- tute the notion of dynamic syntheses. An entity (e.g., molecule, crystal, and organism) behaves as it does not because it pos- sesses, or is acted upon by, a meta-empirical force, but because, as a going concern, it is integrated into a unitary mode of response. We must, then, assert that energy, life, and mind should not be hypostatized into entities; they are functional unities. Let us set down these oppositions for future reference:</page><page sequence="11">ENERGY THE SOUL OF MATTER 71 The Spatial Aspect The Temporal Aspect Material .......................... Activistic Substantial ........................ Energic Structural ......................... Functional Static.............................Dynamic This allows us to make various proportions or analogies. Thus we may say that soul is to body as life is to protoplasm, or as time is to space. Since in physics energy is the dynamic aspect of which matter is the structural or static aspect, we can also assert that energy is the soul of matter. But it was already stated that soul is the harmony of the body. In order that these statements may square up with each other we must reinterpret the meaning of the concept of energy in such a way that the changes initiated by physical energy are understood to express the striving for harmony. This is a view which physicists have neither discussed nor espoused, and I am afraid that at this point the prosaic physicists of the older school will be inclined to exclaim, What nonsense is this you are uttering? What has energy to do with harmony? This we must now try to show. 4. ENERGY AS HARMONY In defense of this view let us first note that energy is com- monly held to be of two forms, namely, kinetic energy of motion and potential energy. A body is said to possess potential energy when it has the capacity to do work. But what confers upon it this ability to perform work? The answer usually given is that bodies possess potential energy by virtue of their position. Po- tential energy may, therefore, be said to represent the tendency to change position or spatial location. A body possesses this tendency and capacity because, in the position in which it is, the forces concerned are not in equilibrium-or if they are it is an equilibrium under stress, and when the equilibrium is upset a readjustment occurs in which the forces involved tend to alter the positions of the bodies concerned in such a way that a more stable equilibrium results. But what is there about the</page><page sequence="12">72 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION positions of material objects or particles which gives them this capacity to perform work? What is there in common between the chemical energy of a carbon molecule and the rock perched on a cliff? Here we have a profound mystery. We use the terms equilibrium, energy, potential, stress, and the like with much glibness, as though the meanings of these terms were entirely clear to us. But perhaps they are only charitable words covering our scientific sins. Indeed, some would go farther and object to the use of the term "energy." In his The Philosophy of 'As If' Hans Vaihinger tells us that "energy" is a personificatory fiction. But it is also obvious, as W. Ostwald pointed out, that we know "matter" only in terms of its actions and effects upon us. Therefore, if we reject energy as a reality we must also reject matter. Rather than accept such a bleak scientific skepticism we will assume that energy has as much reality as what we call matter, and that the one notion is as necessary to the other as the functional aspect is to the structural. Alice in Wonderland found a cat which could evaporate into the thin air and leave only its grin behind. In physics such things cannot happen. If you have a grin (be- havior) you will always find the cat (matter) to which the grin is attached, and vice versa. This analogy illustrates the insep- arability of structure and function. The best guess concerning the nature of potential energy seems to consist in trying to articulate in more detail the con- ception of stresses and strains which are supposed to be associ- ated with potential energy. These strains were formerly sup- posed to exist in the ether of space, but since the ether, like the Cheshire cat, has attenuated itself almost to the point of non- existence we find it difficult to imagine an elastic distortion in something which does not exist. However, we still have with us, in some form or other, the notion of the electromagnetic field. Here is one reality of the old physics which is still in good repute. Perhaps the potential energy due to position has for its basis a stretched condition of the lines of force which are asso-</page><page sequence="13">ENERGY THE SOUL OF MATTER 73 ciated with the configuration of material elements. Physicists tend to regard the "lines of force" which, e.g., lie between a magnet and a piece of iron, as a kind of geometrical abstraction; but Faraday, who first presented this theory, really took them to be actualities. Moreover, Sir J. J. Thomson, who conceives the ether to possess a filamental structure, also thinks of "tubes" of force as physical realities. If this conception, in which the field of force takes the place of the older ether of space, should continue to preserve its good standing we will have to conceive space to be spiderwebbed with interlacing lines of force. We will then be driven to interpret the behavior of material bodies in terms of tensions and relaxations within energy fields. And this is where the notion of harmony comes in. Nature is trying to establish conditions of equilibrium. She is seeking to reduce the potential energies of bodies. The re- sulting shifting of the gradients of the corresponding energy- fields upsets the equilibria of the other bodies which are thereby influenced. The (relatively) isolated configurations within na- ture must adjust themselves to other and neighboring configu- rations, with their corresponding energy potentials. Since the motions resulting from the conversion of potential energies of bodies into kinetic energies are due to relative positions, we cannot interpret potential energy in terms of single bodies alone. We must seek for the explanation of motion in the uni- verse as a whole. The activities of material complexes must ex- press the impulse toward readjustments on the part of the cos- mos in its entirety. This is consistent with what the general theory of relativity expresses in the statement that "gravitation simply represents a continual effort of the universe to straighten itself out.' An absolute equilibrium condition, involving the universal rest of an Aristotelian God, is possible only if the energy pat- terns associated with the various microscopic material com- I E. T. Whittaker, "The Outstanding Problems of Relativity," Science, LXVI (1927), 227.</page><page sequence="14">74 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION plexes were integrated into some macroscopically equilibrated pattern of lines of force. But equipotential surfaces running through all the dimensions of the universe as a whole seem to be impossible. There seems to be some tendency in the universe which opposes an absolute equipoise. If we interpret the second law of energetics (or thermo-dynamics) to express the tendency of energy to run "down hill" toward an equilibrium, we may find that it is eventually self-defeating because, in order to lower the potential energy in one part of the universe, it is perhaps necessary for energy to run "up hill" in some other part of the universe. This may sound like nonsense, but if so it merely illustrates how nonsensical the "new" physics can become. But this is a digression. The point which is relevant is that it is no mere figure of speech to say that nature is trying to produce a harmony out of the body of matter with which she has to work. In this sense nature has something of a soul, and the soul is the integrated energy patterns and constellations of lines of forces associated with the potentials of positional objects. According to this view, which resembles pan-psychism in some respects, consciousness is associated with the potential energy of matter, and the more potential energy a thing has the more soul it is capable of expressing. This forces us to con- clude that we can find in "inanimate" nature the promise and potency of mind. It also follows that adaptive behavior in or- ganisms has its earliest analogy in the adaptive behavior of in- organic bodies. A rock tending to fall down the incline of a cliff has the same sort of directed response which in organisms we call "instincts." But in such a situation there is lacking that integration and intensification of synergy which is present in complex organisms. Nevertheless, it is correct to say that wher- ever in nature there is a store of potential energy in an unstable equilibrium, which can be released by a trigger effect, whenever in nature an object is under stress and strain and is trying to equilibrate itself with its environment by reducing its potential energy to a minimum (in accordance with our interpretation of</page><page sequence="15">ENERGY THE SOUL OF MATTER 75 the second law of energetics), there we have the condition for the presence of consciousness." Energy is regarded as the soul of matter because it represents this persistence of tendency in the direction of doing work. Soul is regarded as the harmony of the body because it represents the integration of energy patterns as they are unified into a dynamically functioning complex of "behavior-stuff." Such an interpretation of potential energy may seem to secure little support or encouragement from physics itself. But this is because physicists, in the past, have entered into a kind of un- conscious conspiracy not to admit that the phenomena of physi- cal nature might be explained in many other ways than those which were fashionable. All textbooks were written in such a way as to maintain the uniformity of doctrine which was (and still is) to be found in them. But that we actually have a choice among different types of physical philosophy is one of the se- crets physicists can no longer keep to themselves. The secret is out, and now mischief is afoot. Let us justify the apparently heretical doctrine that alternative types of physical philosophy are available to those who like variety in their intellectual menus. 5. THE CONCEPTS OF PHYSICS A few years ago the opinion was generally held that the mechanical picture of nature which physics presents is objective, that physics had solved all of its important problems, and that no radical reconstruction of its fundamentals was at all likely. The universality of this view was largely a consequence of the fact that most textbooks to which the average reader had access were concerned with the same subjects, treated these subjects in approximately the same manner, and agreed in most of what they had to say. And so the belief was current that there was no element of choice, arbitrariness, or subjectivity in physical 2 So far as I am aware, the only other philosopher who has asserted an intimate con- nection between consciousness and potential energy is Professor W. P. Montague. Among scientists similar views have been presented by W. K6hler and N. Rashevsky.</page><page sequence="16">76 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION science. Physics was supposed to give us an objectively real account of nature, free from all anthropomorphism. This idea, we now know, is quite false. In a moment we will examine the reasons for this change of front. But before doing so it will be well to examine the method by which physics proceeds in build- ing up its explanatory concepts. The general procedure of physics consists in defining certain primary magnitudes and then constructing from these the de- rived'magnitudes. These are built up by complicating the fun- damental magnitudes. Physicists generally select length (L), mass (M), and time (T) as the primary units. This gives us the centimeter-gram-second system of measurement. Now let us notice how the derived magnitudes arise out of these primary magnitudes. Velocity, as we all know, is directly proportional to the distance covered by the moving body and inversely pro- portional to the time. Or V o L/T. To state the matter in other terms, velocity is the time-rate of change of position. If the ve- locity of a body is not constant, but is uniformly accelerated, then the velocity of a body at the end of t seconds is expressed thus: v = at, where a is the acceleration. In other words, acceler- ation is the time-rate of change of velocity. In the same way we go on to define force as the space-rate of change of energy. We may summarize these facts and the method by which the process is carried on in the following table of derived magni- tudes: Velocity = cm. per second Acceleration =cm. per sec. per sec. Force = MX a= dyne Work =FXS Power = Work Time We can express all these physical quantities in terms of length (L), mass (M), and time (T). Whenever we use the symbol T-' this means that time occurs in the denominator:</page><page sequence="17">ENERGY THE SOUL OF MATTER 77 Area =L2 To Mo Volume =L3 To Mo Velocity =L' T-' Mo Acceleration =L' T-2 Mo Force = L T-2 M' Energy = L2 T-' M' This method of scientific procedure is very useful. Its effect becomes vicious only when we conclude that, since we can ex- press the qualitative results studied in the higher sciences (e.g., psychology, biology, etc.) in terms of complexes of the simple units of the primary magnitudes, therefore the data studied in these sciences are reducible to physical magnitudes. Even this would not be harmful provided we were willing to read into physical reality the properties and qualities of the original phenomena which were thus analyzed into physical magnitudes. For example, there would be no objection to the view that when we analyze the activities of living organisms-such as growth, self-repairing processes, etc.-into surface tensions, ionic migra- tions, osmotic pressures, phasic equilibria, etc., the adaptive be- havior of life is these chemical reactions. But when we do this we must be willing to admit that inorganic chemical reactions contain within themselves the essence of that which appears in organisms as purposive response. It is clear that physical chem- istry as ordinarily interpreted does not permit of this vitaliza- tion of physical reality. A brief survey of the manner in which physics came to be interpreted in a materialistic-mechanistic way will fortify our contention that physics might have been, and still may be, interpreted in such a way as to provide the basis for purposive behavior. The failure on the part of some physicists to recog- nize this fact is a natural consequence of the ignorance on the part of these physicists of the historical evolution of their own subject. It is particularly clear that some contemporary sci- entists do not sufficiently appreciate the importance of the</page><page sequence="18">78 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION interaction of the views of Descartes, Leibniz, and Newton, and how the triumph of Newtonian physics determined the course of the subsequent development of physical doctrines. The view which we are advocating rests on the belief that, in order to arrive at a doctrine in which human purposes do not appear as alien influxes in a hostile physical world, we must, like Leibniz, reinterpret the notion of matter in dynamic terms. This is precisely what modern physics is doing. It is interesting to note that philosphers of widely differing points of view (e.g., Bertrand Russell, H. Wildon Carr, et al.) concede that in one respect or another Leibniz has anticipated several of the ideas which we now associate with the theory of relativity. In any case, quite apart from the truth or falsity of that statement, we can make out a strong case for the thesis that one of the consequences of the theory of relativity has been to throw in doubt the assumption that length, work, potential, etc., are ob- jectively measurable and invariant existents. This is the view which Professor Eddington has suggested in his book, The Mathematical Theory of Relativity. Eddington is quite willing to admit that there is much more anthropomorphism in physics than physicists of the recent past were willing to grant. This same idea is also brought out by Norman R. Campbell in his book on Physics: The Elements (chapters x, xiv, xv). Both derived and fundamental magnitudes contain an arbitrary ele- ment connected with the arbitrary choice of unit. Mass, length, and time, Professor Campbell points out, are not necessarily basic magnitudes, but such special features as they possess are derived partly from the dynamic equations in which they occur and the high accuracy with which weights and lengths (but not times) can be compared. All this, of course, merely illustrates the point that there are various ways in which the behavior of the elements of the physi- cal world may be described and explained. In the past it has seemed convenient and fruitful to exclude certain ideas, such as the notion of purpose, from the domain of physical science. But</page><page sequence="19">ENERGY THE SOUL OF MATTER 79 the fundamental ideas of physics were enunciated before the days of evolutionary thought, when the notion was prevalent that physical nature and human experience were mutually ex- clusive realms. Now the time has come to take seriously the implications of evolution. In bringing physical nature and hu- man nature closer together, evolutionary philosophy leaves us with the choice of mechanizing human conduct or vitalizing physical reality. I prefer the latter alternative. We must re- write our physics and our psychology, and in doing so we must tear down some of the walls which man has established--espe- cially where, as in the case of the distinction between the physi- cal and the psychical, nature herself has placed no such barriers. If it is true that the psychological theory of most physicists is obsolete, it is equally true that the physical theory of most psychologists is antiquated. We must again get back into na- ture those qualities which Newton expunged from the realm of physics. The science which results from this fusion of physics and psychology might be called physical psychology, or bio- physics. Whatever its name, the future of this discipline ap- pears bright and promising.3 3 For a more detailed exposition of the foregoing views, especially in relation to the theories of others, the reader may consult the following papers by the writer: "Mathe- matics and Emergent Evolution," Monist, XL (1930), 509-25; and "Gestalt Psychology and the Philosophy of Nature," Philosophical Review, XXXIX (1930), 556-72.</page></plain_text>
