Although time did not permit a detailed survey of the island, I was shown a carved stone figure of a kind hitherto unreported from island Melanesia. Subsequently, in 1971 P. Baram, then a Patrol Officer with the Papua New Guinea administration on Buka Island, recorded three stone figures on Saposa, one of which appears to be that seen by myself in 1967 (P. Baram, in litt.). This note presents a brief account of these figures and dis cusses their possible relationship to the recent ethnographic art of the area. Saposa Island is formed by a low emerged coral platform only a few hectares in area. Its inhabitants, living in Torotsian village on the north-eastern side of the island, number over four hundred persons, speaking an Austronesian language (Allen and Hurd, no date : 44). The carving seen in 1967 (carving A) stands in a clearing about 10 metres from the beach to the east of the village. It is recorded as site DBH on the Archaeological Survey files at the University of Papua New Guinea. According to Baram, the other two carvings (B and C) stand in a graveyard about 200 metres west from carving A towards the village. All three carvings face the sea. Neither Baram nor I were able to identify the rock used to make the carvings, though Baram believes it to be of volcanic origin. If this is correct, the rock must have been brought to the island, for Saposa is composed of limestones only. The carvings are approximately 50 to 60 cm tall and are cylindrical in form. Baram describes carving C as 'obliterated' by weathering, but the other two are sufficiently well preserved to identify their main stylistic details. Carving A appears to be a stylised anthropomorphic figure lacking arms and legs, with the outline of the face, hair and possibly also the ears summarily indicated (figure 2). In contrast, according to a sketch by Baram, the facial features, breasts, and arms with hands resting on the abdomen are clearly depicted on carving B, though the legs are not indicated (figure 3). Baram describes the carving technique of these features as shallow chiselling, distinguishing them from a mark on the stomach said to be a 'surface scratching'. In view of the indication of breasts and absence of male genitalia, Baram identifies carving B as being female. Baram was told by Saposa Islanders that the figures used to eat people, but his informants seemed unable to explain why or when this was supposed to happen. I ob tained no information on this point, nor is there any indication of the age of the carvings. To date, no other stone carvings of comparable form have been published from other parts of the Bougainville Province, though a pillar with a female human figure has been reported, but not illustrated, from Irue village, north-east Bougainville (Terrell and Purupuru, 1972 : 17). Blackwood (1935 : 527-40) describes a number of unmodified and modified boulders on Yame and Buka Islands and on northern Bougainville. Some are dressed standing pillars, though none is shaped into anthropomorphic form. Two pillars on Buka Island, both about 2 metres high, are decorated with geometric designs of triangles, diamonds and circles (Blackwood, 1935 : plates 77 and 78). A similar pillar has been recorded on Pinipel Island north of Buka (Terrell and Purupuru, 1972 : 17). None of the Saposa carvings is decorated in this manner. The only published stone carving from the area, other than perhaps the Irue figure, which bears comparison with the Saposa carvings is a four-faced stone head,</page><page sequence="2">28 only 11 cm high, attributed by O'Reilly (1940 : 188-89) on stylistic grounds to northern Bougainville or to Buka. This specimen, now in the Lateran Museum, resembles in basic form and features carvings A and B from Saposa. Nothing, however, is known of its origin, age or function. None of the worked pillars described by Blackwood appear in local myths or legends. Although the Irue pillar described by Terrell and Purupuru is identified with a woman Kavokohi, nothing is now remembered about her. On the other hand, many of the unworked boulders discussed by Blackwood are identified as urar, spirits of a somewhat malignant disposition. The bouldefcs are said to turn into urar figures at night, when they would walk about, play and even catch fish (Blackwood, 1935 : 527). One boulder near Malasang village on Buka is said to eat fish left on it by fishermen returning home, while another boulder near Lonahan village, north from Malasang, represents the body of a woman who taught her daughter and son-in-law to eat human flesh (Blackwood, 1935 : 529-30). Blackwood argued that the pillars might have been associated with fertility rituals and/or cicatrization ceremonies in view of their phallic form and similar ities between the incised designs and local cicatrization marks. Extrapolation of this interpretation to the Saposa carvings is not possible because of the fundamen tal stylistic differences. There are also some superficial similarities between the Saposa stone carvings and wooden carvings&lt; of huaan forms of recent manufacture from Buka and north Bougain ville. Several authors have described and illustrated these wooden figures but comparatively little is known of their stylistic range and distribution. Many specimens in museums seem to have been commissioned by European visitors of various kinds and were never used in their traditional ritual contexts; hence, one is tempted to question their stylistic authenticity (for example, O'Reilly, 1940 : 189-90; 195-96). Also, their pre-European distribution of manufacture and use is not very clear. Parkinson (1887-88 : 230) observed wooden human figures on north Buka in 1886, and examples attributed to Buka were registered in The Australian Museum in 1885 (Moore and Turner, 1968 : 49). However, Thomas (1931 : 230) states that their manufacture on Pororan Island off the west coast of Buka began only in 1928, while their introduction to east Buka took place around 1920. Finally, a recent general survey of artifacts from the Bougainville Province points out a discrepancy in statements relating to the use of certain figures (Griffin and Griffin, 1975). Schmitz (1962 : plate 25) and BUhler (1962 : 154) state that certain female figures were used in mortuary rites, but Blackwood (1935 : 487-502) nowhere mentions their use in such contexts. Bearing these problems in mind, a comparison can be attempted between the stone carvings and wooden figures. According to Blackwood (1935 : 437-38; cf. O'Reilly, 1940 : 195-96), carved wooden figures were used in certain marriage and puberty ceremonies. When a tsunaun woman of Buka left her home to take up residence in that of her mother-in-law she was preceded by a man carrying a female wooden figure (kaisa). This figure was taken to the young man's house (tobar) of her mother-in-law's clan for permanent storage there. The figure, which hereafter must not be seen by a woman, particularly the new bride, was thought to aid the bride in giving birth to a female first child. The figure illustrated by Çlackwood (1935 : plate 8A) stands on a short pole to facilitate carrying, with its arms by its side. These figures were not used on north Bougainville (Blackwood, 1935 : 95). Wooden figures were also used in puberty ceremonies for both boys and girls. Girls experiencing their first menstruation underwent a period of seclusion in the muben ceremony. On Saposa Island a wooden figure of life-size or greater than life size was made in the form of a girl decorated for the muben, and wasjkept within her mother's house during the period of seclusion. Later in life the figure might be</page><page sequence="3">29 used at the girl's marriage (Blackwood, 1935 : 268). The figure illustrated by Blackwood (1935 : plate 32 left) has its arms by its side and is quite realistically carved. Boys underwent three main ceremonies in their transition to manhood (wapi, watawuts, and waisipslp), at each of which various male and female human figures, as well as those of animals, were displayed (Blackwood, 1935 : 194 ff.). Those used at the wapi ceremony, celebrating the wearing for the first time at about 8 to 9 years of age the hat known as upi, had human forms mounted on some kind of board or frame, with the arms either at the side or raised in the air. The distinc tion between male and female figures was indicated not through sexual attributes but by the upi worn by the male figure. Frequently the figures had movable limbs to emphasize their life-like appearance. According to Thomas (1931 : 227-30), the ndook ceremony of Pororan Island required the display of related figures (bahuan) representing deceased leaders as well as spirits secondary to the main totemic figures. However, Thomas (1931 : 230) states that the use of such figures in this ceremony began on Pororan only in 1928. Whereas only female figures were used in the muben ceremony for girls and at a tsunaun woman's marriage, the figures used in boys' ceremonies were of both sexes. Unfortunately, the information available does not permit an association of carving style with particular ritual context. All figures are in a full-length standing position, with arms either at the side or with hands crossed over the lower abdomen; in a few cases the arms are raised above the shoulders. Some figures stand on a short pole base suitable for carrying the figure or for placing in the ground. Figures from the nineteenth century (e.%. specimen E602 in Moore and Turner, 1968 : 49) appear to be more angular and stylised, with straight lines at the shoulders and on the face than those of more recent manufacture (e.g. Blackwood, 1935 : plate 8; see also Waite, 1974). This angularity of the early figures distantly recalls the faces of carvings A and B on Saposa, though the angularity of the shoulders is not matched on the stone figures. The Saposa carving B has its hands crossed over on the abdomen in a manner identical to that of specimen E602 in The Australian Museum (Moore and Turner, 1968 : 49). This latter figure is unmistakably male, yet in common with many other male figures from the northern Solomon Islands the pectoral muscles are emphasized as if they were female breasts. Baram's identification of carving B as female is, in the absence of other sexual attributes, to be queried. The downward extensions of what might be termed the hair-line of carving B resemble the extended ear-lobes commonly found on wooden carvings from Buka and northern Bougainville. Although there is not an identity of style between the stone and wooden carvings, the similarities suggest a possible link between the two groups. If we accept this possibility, then there may be also a possible functional relationship, even though all of the wooden figures discussed by Blackwood seem to have been carried either in processions or in some kind of display. It is highly improbable that the stone carvings were ever carried in this manner; their weight would make this virtually impossible. This would suggest that the stone carvings were not used in the ceremony associated with a newly-wed tsunaun woman, for the carrying of the wooden figure seems to symbolise the relocation of the woman's residence. We are left, then, with the possibility that the stone carvings may have been used in puberty rites. The lack of male sexual specification of the carvings prevents an association with the boys' rites, though if Baram's identification of carving B as female is accepted, then either male or female rites might be considered. Baram reports a local Saposa story that the stone carvings used to eat people. It is possible that this might refer to the supposed killing or consumption of initiates during the wapi ceremony for boys (Blackwood, 1935 : 209-21; cf. Thomas, 1931, 229-31). However, Blackwood did not record any association between stone pillars or named boulders and male initia tion ceremonies, though on Teop Island children of a certain lineage were taken to a</page><page sequence="4">30 group of stone slabs prior to various growth rites and feasts (Blackwood, 1935 : 536-37; Terrell and Purupuru, 1972 : 18). ' The possibility of linking the Saposa stone carvings with the wooden figures used in the girls' muben ceremony seems rather remote. In recent years a wooden figure was made for each girl passing through the ceremony; if the stone carvings were precursors of these wooden figures, one might expect a much larger number of stone carvings on Saposa, one in fact for each girl, unless there was a change in the relationship between girl and figure following the period when the stone carv ings were used. Moreover, one would also have to assume a change in the role of the figure, for in recent times the wooden figure would be stored in the mother's house during the muben seclusion period, which would be difficult to do with the stone carvings unless there were many such carvings of which only three have been reported. The evidence currently available is inadequate to present a firm case in favor of these stone carvings having a relationship with puberty rites on Saposa. Before that can be attempted, we need much more information on the style of the wooden figures and on the style and age of the stone carvings. It is even possible that the stone carvings have nothing to do with the present-day population of the island, and that any stylistic similarities with wooden figures from the nineteenth century are fortuitous. In the meantime, we should not ignore the possibility that the Saposa stone carvings might represent a phase in the development of the art of the northern Solomon Islands which is now preserved in museums. Note: My visit to Saposa Island in 1967 was made possible through the courtesy of J. Lee of Madehas Plantation, Buka Passage. The correspondence with P. Baram began with a letter from Baram to L. Vimlati, undated but written probably in April 1971. Vimlati, who was at what was then known as the Australian School of Pacific Admin istration, Mosman, N.S.W., forwarded the letter to D.R. Moore of The Australian Museum. Moore subsequently referred the letter to me. In a letter to me dated 1st February 1974 Baram stated that he was unable to provide any information further to his original letter. Pi-gUffi 3 was drawn by G, Mosuadoga, Papua New Guinea Museum, from a sketch provided by Baram. To all of the above people, I wish to extend my thinks. BIBLIOGRAPHY Allen, J. and C. Hurd. no date.
