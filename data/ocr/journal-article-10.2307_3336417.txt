<plain_text><page sequence="1">recent exhibitions EXPRESSIONS OF CAMEROON ART The Valerie Franklin Collection Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County February 1-May 25, 1986 This exhibition of seventy-six objects, most of them from the Grassfields region, exemplifies the variety and contrasts inherent in Came- roon art. It includes memorial figures, drums, stools, masks, and prestige regalia from many ethnic groups. The show, which draws exclu- sively from the collection of Valerie Franklin, was conceived because the tour of "The Art of Cameroon," organized by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES), could not be extended to include Los Angeles. As with the original show, Tamara Northern serves as curator, and SITES made available the photomurals and banners from the earlier installation. At the entrance to the gallery, a brief orien- tation to the material is provided by maps, slides of the country's varying terrain, North- ern's introductory statement, and Franklin's description of the tradition of collecting in her family. The viewer is then presented with two major pieces of Cameroon sculpture: the magnificent Bangwa "queen" figure and the male figure thought to be its mate. Both carv- ings, collected in 1897 or 1898, have been ac- corded much critical acclaim, and justifiably so. The Franklins obtained the female figure when the Helena Rubinstein collection was auctioned in 1966; the owner of the male coun- terpart subsequently made his carving avail- able to them so that the pieces could be re- united. The latter piece, wearing royal pres- tige items that include a cap, a necklace of leopard teeth, and ivory armlets and anklets, has been confidently identified as a royal memorial ancestor figure. The identity of the female figure is still the subject of some de- bate: she has been said to be either a royal wife, priestess of the earth cult, or mother of twins. Northern, in the catalogue to "The Art of Cameroon," argues that she represents simultaneously priestess and mother; in addi- tion she believes that the figures are indeed a pair, and that therefore the female carving portrays a queen as well. A rather startling photograph by Man Ray of the queen figure with a "nude and possibly pregnant model" is exhibited across the way. Although the label does not say so, it is appar- ently meant to illustrate the influence of Afri- can art on modern Western artists; the con- nection is lost unless the viewer knows that Ray was an influential Dada photographer. I overheard several expressions of puzzlement concerning the photograph's purpose in the show. MEMORIAL FIGURE OF A ROYAL TITLED WIFE. GRASSFIELDS, BAMILEKE. 19TH CENTURY. 74cm. BANGWA QUEEN FIGURE WITH MODEL. PHOTOGRAPHED BY MAN RAY IN PARIS, EARLY 1930s. Also displayed in the antechamber are sev- eral other figures, including an almost life- size memorial ancestor figure that is impres- sive in quality as well as in stature. It is jux- taposed against photomurals of Fons (kings), who are often the subject of these sculptures. They can also represent important lineage heads and title holders, loyal retainers, titled wives, and queen mothers. The second room is devoted to prestige items including bowls, pipes, drinking horns, and necklaces. Strategically located photo- murals show some of the objects within their cultural context. Two brass or bronze collars with buffalo horns, part of the Fon's personal regalia, are particularly notable. Cast by the lost-wax method, these fine pieces illustrate the artistry and technical expertise of the Cameroon metalworker. The final room includes figures from the northern periphery of the Grassfields (mainly Mambila), stools, and an effective display of a carved drum with double gongs portrayed on its side. Although the exhibit is advertised as containing only objects from the Grassfields, eleven figures from the Ejagham or Keaka peoples from the Upper Cross River also ap- pear, but no information is provided on their use. Lineage masks form a major portion of the show. This presentation is particularly effec- tive: the pieces are sequentially placed accord- ing to the order of their appearance in a dance, beginning and ending with a leader mask. African masks are kinetic sculptures-only one portion of the costume of raffia, cloth, feathers, and other materials that shimmer and shake when the performer moves. Al- though the masks are starkly displayed against the wall or in glass cases, several photomurals that show them being danced convey some of the complexity of this art tra- dition. A brief explanation of the function of lineage masks appears on an attractive banner and on labels. The show emphasizes motifs and their meanings. Their interpretations are printed on banners placed in the two major rooms, and labels point out instances of their use. Of particular significance are the frog, spider, and triangle, all royal symbols. The installa- tion is attractively designed, with large, bright triangles placed on the walls to unify the presentation. This exhibition is aimed at a well-educated audience with a prior knowledge of African art. While the Cameroon music and slide projections might attract the families passing through on their way to the displays of plants, wildlife, and dinosaurs located elsewhere in the museum, the information is too scholarly to assist them in comprehending the material. One wishes that the art were presented so that viewers, both expert and novice, could gain a greater understanding of and respect for the rich and varied cultures that have pro- duced it. Given that there are many other major col- lections in the Los Angeles area that could have augmented the material on display, the decision of the Natural History Museum to 70 immilligi I EME</page><page sequence="2">draw only from a single collection inevitably limits the comprehensiveness of the show. Perhaps this is the result of a recurring prob- lem for curators endeavoring to circumvent the myriad administrative restrictions that now control the mounting of an exhibition. Yet, there is much to be said for being able to observe the coherence within a collection of diverse pieces, sustained by a single owner's taste and judgment. It is not often that such complete personal accumulations are on dis- play, and we must be grateful to Valerie Franklin for allowing this opportunity to ad- mire some of the major pieces in her collec- tion. Elisabeth L. Cameron Pasadena, California THE RISING OF A NEW MOON A Century of Tabwa Art National Museum of African Art Washington, D.C. January 29-March 17, 1986 This exhibition was the culmination of a three-year project presenting the first in- depth study of the art and culture of the Tabwa people of eastern Zaire and northern Zambia. The project integrated the disciplines of art history and social anthropology in order to investigate the complicated stylistic varia- tions of Tabwa art over the past hundred years and to explicate the meaning of these artistic forms and symbols as a function of changing political, social, and economic envi- ronments. Supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities with addi- tional help from Sabena Belgian World Air- lines, the exhibition was conceived as an overview of Tabwa art from the mid- nineteenth century to the present. It con- tained ninety-eight objects carefully selected from over twenty-six public and private col- lections from seven countries, including the Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale, Tervuren; British Museum; Royal Scottish Museum; Staatliche Museen Preussischer Kulturbesitz, Berlin; Linden-Museum, Stuttgart; Staatliches Museum fur V6olkerkunde, Munich; Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etno- grafico (Museo Pigorini) of Rome; and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Approximately half of the objects repre- sented the major stylistic categories of Tabwa figural sculpture. These were centered around three historically important objects from the third quarter of the nineteenth cen- tury: figures of the ancestors of chiefs Lusinga, Kansabala, and Manda. Collected in 1884 by the Belgian Emile Storms, the carvings were generously lent by the Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale, which holds the world's largest and most representative collections of Tabwa art and material culture. The two most important categories of anthropomorphic sculpture, the figure on another's shoulders and cylindrical twin figures, were also fea- tured to demonstrate various sculptural themes developed in different geographical areas over many generations.

Along with this concentration on figural sculpture, the exhibition described the mask- ing tradition, including rare anthropomor- phic examples as well as the more common buffalo mask. To the pieces from these two groups, which formed the core of the show, were added the finest examples of the other object types, such as staffs, axes, paddles and whisks, pipes, bellows, high-backed stools, neckrests, combs and items of personal adornment, musical instruments, and bas- kets. The exhibition and its accompanying catalogue have provided an opportunity to broach a number of theoretical issues in the cross-disciplinary study of African art. The first of these is the matter of ethnicity. Many Tabwa objects have been attributed to groups called "Kunda," "Tumbwe," "Holoholo," "Djidji," or other names subsumed by the term "Tabwa." Tabwa live at the crossroads of important routes along which people, goods, and ideas have long moved. The history of such commerce must be complemented by studying the social mechanisms by which ethnic identity is defined and shared, if one is to understand who has produced the art ob- jects in question. The next question must be: if neighboring (and better-known) groups such as the Hemba and Luba have produced so many works of art, why have Tabwa made and used so few? A sense of Tabwa history is essential here, for one can hypothesize that there was a sudden and relatively brief flowering of art, STANDING MALE FIGURE. WOOD, CANING, HORN, STRING. SEED PODS.

In the early nineteenth century Tabwa lived in small, virtually autonomous villages, led by chiefs chosen from the lineages of original settlers. Art ob- jects were made to be used in ritual, to facili- tate change from one state of affairs to another (as, say, in cases of the resolution of misfor- tune). Such "process art," to borrow a distinc- tion drawn by Malcolm McLeod, is still impor- tant to Tabwa as they cope with personal dif- ficulties or moments of transition. Beginning in the 1850s, though, several Tabwa chiefs were able to consolidate their powers through participation in the ivory and slave trade to the coast. As their rule became increasingly absolute, they commissioned objects of "statement art" to focus their subjects' atten- tion on this newfound royalty. Ancestral fig- 71</page></plain_text>
