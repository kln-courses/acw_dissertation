ABSTRACT Computational finite element (FE) modeling of real world motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) is valuable for analyzing crash-induced  injury patterns and mechanisms. Due to unavailability of detailed modern FE vehicle models, a simplified vehicle model (SVM) based  on laser scans of fourteen modern vehicle interiors was used. A crash reconstruction algorithm was developed to semi-automatically  tune the properties of the SVM to a particular vehicle make and model, and subsequently reconstruct a real world MVC using the tuned  SVM. The required algorithm inputs are anthropomorphic test device position data, deceleration crash pulses from a specific New Car  Assessment Program (NCAP) crash test, and vehicle interior property ranges. A series of automated geometric transformations and five  LSDyna positioning simulations were performed to match the FE Hybrid III’s (HIII) position within the SVM to reported data. Once  positioned, a baseline simulation using the crash test pulse was created. A Latin hypercube sample space (9 variables) of 120  simulations was created to vary occupant safety and restraint properties. Sprague and Geers magnitude and phase error factors were  used to identify an optimal set of restraint parameters to reconstruct the HIII kinematic and kinetic responses. Using the tuned SVM,  event data recorder pulses from real world crashes, and the Total HUman Model for Safety, LS-Dyna simulations were used to  reconstruct the occupant-vehicle interactions. In a sample case, stress, strain, and dynamic loads were evaluated to predict rib, sternum,  and vertebral injuries sustained by the occupant in the crash.

Phase II was  completed to automatically position THUMS v4.01 within the  previously tuned SVM in a range of pre-crash positions.

Phase III  applied the longitudinal EDR pulse from the CIREN crash to each of  the previously established potential occupant pre-crash positions.
