XII + 117 pp. of Text, 29 text figures (line drawings), 16 monochrome &amp; 2 colour plates. Göteborg, Paul Äströms Förlag, 1991 (= Studies in Mediterranean Archaeology , Vol. LXX.3). In 1988 immediate notices appeared in several journals announcing the strikingly interesting find of a pottery bowl, in form a house (or shrine) model, containing and associated with a variety of stone and pottery objects (figurines etc.) which gave all the appearance of being a ritual hoard. The context was a Chalcolithic (round house) village at Kissonerga in the Pa- phos District of Western Cyprus. This caught the stop-press of the recent manual Ancient Building in Cyprus (Brill 1992) where an inser- tion (p. 251) summarised the announcements. "The model was fashioned to imitate a building with entrance, swivel door, hearth and floor partitions It is clear from the parallels among excavated structures that the model is based on contemporary structures. The similari- ties with the Vounous model are striking. It is therefore normal to conclude that the object is a model of an actual round enclosure shrine. It is however possible that the object in itself constitutes the shrine . . .". And there in the normal course of excavation publishing the matter might have rested for 10- 20 years pending the end of field work and final publication of results - with perhaps in the interim several disputatious articles asserting rival interpretations of the feature based on the limited preliminary announcements. It is thanks to the superior imagination, energies and talents of Dr. Peltenberg that the actual sequel is quite different. In less than 5 years from the discov- ery an excellent final publication of the material has appeared which exhaustively and meticu- lously sets out all the archaeological facts of the discovery plus the definite analysis of the ob- jects discovered. In addition it provides a most interesting background to the significance of the discovery where breadth of reference is joined with balance of judgement to exclude partialities of interpretation. Not only is this a very substantive contribution to Cypriote ar- chaeological literature, but the prevention of ill-founded dispute is equally welcome. It is a duty to give a summary of the contents of this book. In effect the study is in three parts: 1) The archaeological circumstances of the discovery (= chap. 1). 2) The material discovered (= chaps. 2-10). 3) The interpretation of the discovery (= chap. 11).</page><page sequence="2">Rezensionen 159 Chap. 1 "The Context and Contents of the Cere- monial Area" gives a meticulous account of every circumstance bearing on the meaning of the finds and already makes vital changes to the picture given in the preliminary announcements. The sum of the ma- terial "unique caches of nested pots, over 50 ex- ceptional artifacts and associated heat-cracked stone (were) recovered from two pits" (p. 1) belonging to the third of five periods of occupation at Kissonerga which is ca. 3000 BC in date. Whereas it was initially announced that these pits were dug below the floor of a round house (994) it is now ascertained that these pits were cut down into a cobbled space (yard) between several round houses; and that Building 994 was a later construction, the wall of which took cognisance of the pits and was built over their mar- gins so as to enclose them! There were other similar pits in the area and it is opined that they are earth ovens operated by heated stones. Thus the area was reckoned a communal space where food preparation and consumption took place, and associated with this on one occasion the unique caches of objects were deposited (in such a way that their presence remained recognisable). Outstanding among numbers of striking objects was the bowl in the form of a model round house which in its detailing reproduced very accurately the principal features of the round houses of the settle- ment - and this is exhaustively described with full comparative analysis (chap. 2, pp. 12-27). However of virtually equal note are "The Anthropomorphic Figurines" (chap. 4, pp. 39-60) formed out of both stone and pottery. Whereas only one of the 10 stone figurines is modelled as female (pls. 5-9), all 8 pottery figurines are recognisably female (pls. 8-12, figs. 23- 25). Whatever may be the precise interpretation of their significance, all these pottery figurines "are closely related to aspects of childbirth". Another very striking object was "a perfect specimen of a triton or trumpet shell" (chap. 10 "Mollusca", pp. 75-84 &amp; pls. 1.5, 15), but "since the apex is intact it could not have been sounded as a trumpet", which is its general purpose in religious contexts. Other chapters deal with the Ground Stone Objects, Lithics, Plant Re- mains, etc. So much for the Darstellung of this im- portant discovery. As might be expected every aspect is dealt with concisely and precisely in the text and is well and amply illustrated. What is less a matter of expectation is Dr. Pel- ten berg's Vorstellung of the meaning of the hoard - Chap. 11 "Contextual Implications of the Kissonerga Rituals", pp. 85-108. The hypothetical explanations of such a collection of objects are many and varied, cf. foundation deposits, funerary deposits, votive deposits, bothroi, favissae, etc., etc. and the range of comparanda is enormous. Dr. Peltenberg begins his work by seeking to restrict the enquiry as far as possible to intrinsic evidence and his consideration of this is good archaeological deduction. There was no doubt from the circumstances of the deposition that "there was a need to keep these objects together" and they thus comprise a special purpose set. Further- more the condition of the objects at deposition was tell tale. They "were well worn ... so they were not specifically made for interment". On the other hand particular objects were mutilated (or nullified) shortly before deposition" by breaking off parts or covering over with paste etc. - i.e. they were ritually killed in known ways. Dr. Peltenberg's reconstruction of events is that a communal meal was prepared and eaten in this area, then the objects were deposited together with the burnt stones, ash, etc. from the cooking of the meal in such a way that their presence remained evident for some time until they were en- closed within the space of Building 993 (where their presence again remained evident). Why was this done? It was certainly a ceremony and may be called a ritual, but Dr. Peltenberg wishes to guard against projecting later historical concepts back into prehistoric times in assuming a basic dis- tinction between religious and non- religious life and instrumentalities. He considers the ceremony to be a public "closure ritual", how epocal the closure was is not be stated lightly. As to whether it should be reckoned part of religious life or not, Dr. Peltenberg would wish to defer this question until a better un- derstanding of life in Chalcolithic Cyprus makes it more meaningful. Certainly he is able to point out that many of the objects and incidents associated with this "closure ritual" survive in religious contexts during later (n.b. 2000 years later) times. In this instance Dr. Peltenberg adds some remarks and illus- trations concerning the parallel development of the temple and the house, while he also rehearses some current ideological literature on the meaning of ritual etc. It is to be hoped that this summary account of Dr. Peltenberg's book will do more than passing comments to demonstrate its great mer- it. With it in hand any reader is in a valid position to apply his own theories to the sub- ject. Avignon. G.R.H. Wright.</page></plain_text>
