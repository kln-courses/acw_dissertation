<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Timely Book FREEDOM IS OURSELVES: LEGAL RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE CITIZEN AS A BASIS FOR CIVIC EDUCATION, by William O. Penrose. Newark, Dela- ware: University of Delaware Press, 1952. xviii+256 pp. $2.00. The thesis of this volume is that present high-school and college courses in the workings of democracy ought to be torn down, because they are all superstructure and leave out the factor of living, and then rebuilt in the warm, vital architecture of democracy itself. Dean Penrose speaks out strongly and persuasively against courses in "civics" and "government" which center around the institutions of government and virtu- ally ignore the fundamental democratic equation of the rights and duties of individuals. He condemns a teaching of democracy which treats citizens-- and students--as spectators who may expect to receive freedom like a lollipop handed out by an anthropomorphic government to those who recite a pledge of allegiance to their flag. He would remake these courses so that they would lead to active participation in the experience of achieving freedom only by the hard process of give-and-take and by individual contribution to the preserva- tion of an essential ideal. Dean Penrose proceeds to outline the materials from which courses centering around the rights and duties of indi- viduals could be constructed. He does this by surveying American legal experi- ence in the guaranteeing of civil liberties, property rights, and political privileges; and in the establishing of citizens public duties. Although this survey is in some ways superficial and perhaps seems to attribute to ' the law" some of the independent significance the author r .'' ightly denies to the government Dean Penrose supports fully both phases of his thesis: that the essence of democ- racy's lesson and experience lies in its attention to the rights and duties of citizens as individuals, and that there is the stuff here for revitalizing civic educa- tion by organizing it around democ.racy's central human trials and experiences instead of around their institutional reflections. Intriguing possibilities of inductive teaching are suggested by the proposal that ''case studies' of "court cases and incidents in school and community life" be substituted for the sterile abstractions and jingoistic exhortations which have become the deadwood skeletons of so many textbooks in this field. The proof of this pudding must await someone's doing the tough job which is indicated, and yet this volume itself contains references to sufficient material of this kind to make the next step not too difficult. This is a valuable book. It comple- ments criticism with constructive sug- gestion, precept with example. It is also a timely book. Today's newspapers bear ominous testimony to the necessity that tomorrow's citizens learn that they, more than the officers and agents of gov- ernment, are the responsible stewards of freedom. W.
