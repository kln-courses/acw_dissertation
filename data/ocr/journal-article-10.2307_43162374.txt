MacDonald-Rain- tree, Inc. 205 W. Highland Ave., Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53203. 1978. (Grades K-3) Each volume in the series has 32 pages of color drawings and brief narratives, a review page, a page of questions and answers, and a vocabulary list coded to pages where used. Short, simple, declarative sentences make the books appropri- ate for primary children. Although several illustrators contributed to the collection, the art- work is consistent, colorful, and realistic. Labels identify whole and parts of structures. Most drawings are at least a half page. It is difficult to write primary level books that are accurate without increasing the level of sophistication and terminology. This has led to shortcomings in Leaves. The insectivorous pitcher plant is described as one which "grows in hot countries." Actually, it is a common bog plant of temperate areas in the eastern and northern U.S. Some anthropomorphism occurs- describing the folding of leaves of sensitive plants as "trying to move away from the touch." The publisher's notes state that concepts in the books have been correlated with major basal science texts, but the books lack information on this. However, content and concepts are general and should match easily with other published materials. Highly recom- mended as a library reference set and as supple- mentary reading. John R.
