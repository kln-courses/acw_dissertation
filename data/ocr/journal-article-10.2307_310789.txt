<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME ASPECTS OF INVISIBILITY BY ARTHUR STANLEY PEASE IN ONE of the noblest and most awesome passages in Greek tragedy1 Sophocles describes, by the medium of a messenger, the last moments of the aged Oedipus, when, after a mysterious voice had cried "Oedipus, Oedipus, why delay we to go? Thou tarriest too long," the outcast king, taking King Theseus with him as a witness, withdrew from his sorrowful children and com- panions to a supernatural translation. "After no long time we looked back, and Oedipus we saw nowhere any more, but the king alone, holding his hand before his face to screen his eyes, as if some dread sight had been seen, and such as none might endure to behold. . . . But by what doom Oedipus perished, no man can tell,2 save Theseus alone. No fiery thunderbolt of the god removed him in that hour, nor any rising of storm from the sea; but either a messenger from the gods, or the world of the dead, the nether adamant, riven for him in love, without pain; for the passing of the man was not with lamentation, or in sickness and suffering, but, above all mortals', wonderful." With this simple, yet highly imaginative story as a point of departure I should like to discuss certain features of the Greek and Roman beliefs in regard to invisibility, clearly recognizing that their civilization furnishes only a part of countless instances of such phenomena, distributed through many centuries and cultures, a few of which from the Jewish-Christian tradition I shall also mention. Though my primary theme is human rather than divine invisibility, I must, for reasons later to become ap- parent, start with a brief discussion of the invisibility of the gods. To early Greek anthropomorphism the gods, especially those of 1 Soph. 0. C. 1645-1666; cf. also 1623-1630. Jebb's translation has been used. Cf. also W. Jaeger, Paideia (Engl. tr., Oxford), I (1939), 282: "Hallowed by pain, he is in some mysterious way brought near to divinity; his agonies have set him apart from other men." 2 F.

In Homer many of them still move freely among men, and this Homeric tradition crystallizes into a literary convention in later poetry, notably in Virgil and other Roman epic poets- Lucan alone excepted-, while the deus ex machina occasionally introduces the same immediate participation of deities into the field of tragedy, with the added necessity of justifying its plausi- bility to the eye as well as to the ear. With less localized and more syncretistic gods, however, of wider jurisdiction and more obviously superhuman powers, visible association with individual men or even with large human groups is bound to diminish, while the greater refinement of the moral natures of the gods makes them less suited to mingle directly with sinful men in the rough and tumble of military and political issues. As man's own moral nature rises above barbarism, so that he demands more of his gods in character and behavior, the line between the divine and the human becomes more sharply drawn, and visible participation of deities in human affairs is no longer frequent and natural but rare and miraculous, and hence involves either a greater act of faith on the part of mortals who have not seen or else a more convincing array of the evidence of eye-witnesses. This is clearly recognized at a later epoch in the Fourth Gospel,4 when, after Thomas had addressed Jesus as "My Lord and my God," he received the reply, "Because thou hast seen me thou a On various types of theophany see F. Pfister in PW, IV Supplbd. (1924), 282. While on Olympus the gods were, naturally, not seen by mortals; cf. Schol. II.

This rarer glimpsing of the face of deity- has three distinct results. (I) First, a popular, somewhat superstitious view that the divine vision, as a phenomenon more unusual and startling than it had formerly been considered, might bring distinct perils to the beholder. As the Lord declares to Moses,6 "Thou canst not see my face, for there shall no man see me and live." As early as Homer' it is stated that gods revealed are hard to look upon, and through subsequent literature the thought recurs, for example in the Ion of Euripides,8 in Callimachus' (who says: "But the laws of Cronos order thus: Whosoever shall behold any of the immortals, when the god himself chooses not, at a heavy price shall he behold"), in Plato9a and in Horace.1o Accordingly a benign deity or angel often begins his address with the phrase "Fear not." (2) Second, the more philosophic view gradually develops that God is a spirit,12 and that things seen are material, and hence temporal"3 rather than eternal. "The divine (Tr6 oLov)," says Em- 5 God being to the Jews often and to the Christians regularly invisible; cf. Job 9. II; 23. 8-9; John I. I8; Rom. I. 20; I Tim. I. 17; Heb. 2. 27. 6 Exod. 20. 19; 33. 20; cf. also Gen. 32. 30; Exod. 19. 21; Judges 6. 22-23; 13. 22; Is. 6. 5. 'II.

For the dazzling of the eye of the soul which tries to gaze upon God compare the passages from Plato and Philo collected by R. M. Jones in Class. Phil. XXI (1926), 102; also E. S. McCartney in Class. Journ. XXXVI (1941), 485-488. 11 E.g., Ov. M. XV 658; Matt. 28. 2-5; Luke I. 11-13; 1. 29-30; 2. 9-Io; Rev. 1. 17. 12 John 4. 24. Xen. Mem. IV 3. 14, compares God to a wind and to the soul, both effective though invisible--an idea often later expressed, e.g., by Theophil. Ad Autol. I 5; Serv. Aen. VI 724, p. Ioo Thilo. 13 II Cor. 4. 18. He who worships visible gods is more wretched than those demons themselves, says Clement (Protrept. Io. 97, P. 71 St.). Lactantius asserts (Inst. VII I I. 9) that the unseen is eternal because subject to no external violence as are the things which are material; cf. the parallels collected by J. B. Mayor on Cic. N. D. I 20.</page><page sequence="4">4 Arthur Stanley Pease pedocles,'4 as quoted by Clement of Alexandria,s5 "cannot be approached by our eyes or grasped with our hands"; "God can- not be grasped; if he can be grasped he is not God," declares an anonymous Greek tragic fragment;16 Isaiah17 speaks of the deus absconditus or hidden God, an idea developed in the thought of some later Christian theologians; "Mortal eyes are too weak to see Zeus" is an Orphic statement quoted by Justin Martyr.18 The importance of this view in Platonic thought is obvious; the Platonizing Moses, Philo, declares: "When you hear that God was seen by man you must think that this takes place without the light which the senses know, for what belongs to mind can be apprehended only by the mental powers.""19 In the Fourth Gospel20 we are told that "No man hath seen God at any time," while the Beatitudes promise that it is the pure in heart who shall see God,2' presumably by inner vision rather than by outward theophany. These selected passages, drawn from a long range of years and a variety of philosophies, may well illustrate the dif- fusion of this idea, which was sometimes carried a stage further, as when Origen, in the De Principiis,22 asserts that God is not 14 Fr. 133 Diels. 15 Strom.

II. 27. 21 Matt. 5. 8; cf. Ps. 23. 3-4; Matt. 18. to; Heb. 12. 14; I John 3. 2-3; also the similar thought in Schol.

Isaiah 6. 5; also the departure of the gods from among men after the loss of the innocence of the Golden Age; a similar view in Shinto that since the Age of the Gods deities have removed further from earth and are now beyond human vision is noted by W. G. Aston, Shinto, London, 1905, 32. 22 I i. 8. Whether Origen would have extended this principle to invisible beings other than God may be doubted; had he done so he would have had to reject certain Biblical accounts, such as II Kings 6. 17. Perhaps he was denying the claims of medicine-men to a divine vision not vouchsafed to others; cf. J. A. MacCulloch in J. Hastings, Encycl. of Relig. and Ethics, VII (1915), 404. Augustine (C. D. X 13) devotes a chapter to the question of how the</page><page sequence="5">Some Aspects of Invisibility 5 visible to some yet invisible to others (as may well have been implied by various ancient forms of mystery worship23), but is not visible to anyone, because by the nature of his being it is impossible for him to be seen; or as when Philo,24 yet earlier, had gone so far as to declare God to be invisible both to the physical eye and to the mind. Tertullian25 contrasts the invisi- bility of the Father with the manifestation of the Son, a distinc- tion based in part on a Biblical foundation in the words of Jesus, "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.""2 (3) Thirdly, the attribute of invisibility, emphasized by occa- sional theophanies as darkness may be by a sudden flash of lightning, was extended to the whole celestial hierarchy of per- sonified forces,"2 demons,28 angels,29 heroes,30 and various figures invisible God has often disclosed himself, not in his real form, but in one adapted to the powers of his observers. In Od. XVI 16o-162 Athena is seen by Odysseus and by his dogs, but not by Telemachus, and such cases are not rare in ancient literature. One might note also Orestes, who in an hallucination sees the Furies (Aesch. Choeph. Io6I), though they are quite invisible to the sober chorus. 23 Initiation opens "the veil before human eyes by direct contact with a source of revelation," says A. D. Nock (in Gnomon XV (1939), 362), citing Proclus in Plat. Rep. I, p. 75, 5 ff. 24 De special. Leg. II 165. 25 Adv.

Hatch calls to my attention the Apophth. Patrum (Patr. Gr. LXV 232). 29 Philo, Moses, I 166, thinks that the pillar of cloud of the Israelites may have enclosed an angel. In Exod. 33. 9-1o it hides the Lord. Cf. also Coloss. I. 16. 30 E.g., the hero Bormus, who went to fetch water for reapers and dis- appeared (Athen. XIV 62o)-perhaps a replica of the story of Hylas (Theocr. 13. 36-54, and the passages cited by Sittig in PW, IX (1916), 111-113; Paroem. Gr. I 167, no. 21), but suggesting also a victim of amnesia-; the Dioscuri (e.g., Isocr. Archid. 18; Marin. Vit. Procli 32; Dion. Hal. Antiq.

A further extension of invisibility is to ghosts and other appari- 13. 2; Anon. De Vir. ill. 16. 3; Nazar. Panegyr. 15. 4 (Panegyr. Lat. 168 Baehr.); and probably Val. Max. I. 8, ext. 7; Dio Cass. XLI 61.4. Similar figures appear, give aid, and vanish in II Macc. 3. 26-34. More will be said of this type below. 3' E.g., nymphs (Apollon. Rhod. IV 1330) or their lovers, such as Leucippus (Parthen. Narr. amat. 15. 4); or the strange woman who sold the Sibylline books to King Tarquin (Dion. Hal. Antiq. IV 62. 4; Gell. I 19. 9; Schol. Dan. Aen. VI 72), whose supernatural disappearance doubtless contributed not a little to the sanctity of the books themselves; or the mysterious shepherd who appeared on the Roman Capitol (Lyd. De Mens. IV 52); or the strange boy with goat's horns seen by shepherds between Cyrene and Carthage and after his prophecies and sudden disappearance worshipped as Jupiter Ammon (Schol. Dan. Aen. IV 196); or Attus Navius (Dion. Hal. Antiq. III 72. 3); or other cases mentioned in n. 92 infra. Witches, fairies, and saints have in later times been commonly credited with such powers (e.g., Shakesp. Macbeth I. 5; S. Thompson, Motif-Index of Folk-Literature, II, Bloomington, 1933, 301-302; III (1933), 33-34). 32 As in the giving of the Ten Commandments (Exod. I8. 3-24; cf. Philo, De Decalogo 33; 47), or in the speaking of God to the boy Samuel (I Sam. 3. 4-18). 33 Cf. A. S. Pease on Cic. De Div. I ioI. 34 In the deluge-story as given by Syncellus, p. 3oa ff.

If the soul is invisible even during life, while resident in a physical body, it will naturally after death be no less so, unless, indeed, it be one of those souls which, at death, like a clingstone rather than a freestone peach, fail to separate cleanly from their material bodies, as Plato in the Phaedo37 asserts, and so, retaining some- thing of visible substance, are sometimes seen flitting about their funeral monuments. The souls of the men of the Golden Age, Hesiod tells us,38 roam over the earth, clothed in mist, and beneficent in their effects upon men. Elsewhere" Hesiod speaks of thirty thousand spirits who similarly patrol the earth, keeping watch over mortal men. Virgil, more specifically, mentions the phantoms of Creusa40 and Anchises,41 each of which appears to Aeneas, but after delivering its message eludes his physical grip and vanishes, like the kinsmen of Scipio from his grasp in Hades, as related by Silius,42 or the ghost of Achilles from Apollonius of Tyana.43 Phlegon44 describes a ghost which consumes a corpse and then vanishes. 36 Cf. J. A. MacCulloch in J. Hastings, Encycl. of Relig. and Ethics, VII (19I5), 405-406. 13 P. 8Ic-d; cf. Plut. Rom. 28. 7. 38 Op. 121-126. 89 Op. 252-255. 40 Virg. Aen. II 791-795. 4 Virg. Aen. V 740; cf. VI 700-702, though there Anchises associates with Aeneas in the underworld in a manner like that of life save that his form is impalpable to Aeneas's grasp; contrast the scene of Jesus and the doubting Thomas in John 20. 24-29. 42 XIII 648-653; cf. XVII 547, where the fictitious phantom of Scipio vanishes from Hannibal. 43 Philostr. Vit. Apoll. IV I6. On the invisibility of spirits cf. E. B. Tylor, Primitive Culture, I (1874 ed.), 429, and especially 446-447: "To declare that souls or ghosts are necessarily either visible or invisible, would directly con- tradict the evidence of men's senses. But to assert or imply, as the lower races do, that they are visible sometimes and to some persons, but not always or to everyone, is to lay down an explanation of facts which is not indeed our usual modern explanation, but which is a perfectly rational and intelligible product of early science." Also cf. S. Thompson, Motif-Index of Folk-Literature, II (1933), 394, et al. For another instance of the vanishing of a ghost-this time not suddenly but gradually-cf. [Quintil.], Declam. maiores 10.6, p. 193 Lehnert. 44 Mirab. 2, p. 124 Westerm. (= FHG III 615).</page><page sequence="8">8 Arthur Stanley Pease Not always clearly differentiated from ghosts are the forms, divine or human, living or deceased, which appear in dreams, and from the manner in which these vanish when their task or message is concluded one might conjecture that the literary technique of such sudden disappearances is very naturally and in large measure derived. Such dream-phenomena,45 in fact, are so commonly experienced that their imitation in literature in- volves no great strain upon the credulity of the reader. Thus even a writer who, like Lucan, definitely rejects most of the celestial machinery of the traditional epic, may still elaborate the effects of prophetic dreams,46 as he may those of human prophets.47 If the gods, even when pictured as partly physical, are yet able to conceal their own presence from all or some human beings-by means of which I shall presently speak-, it involves no great additional assumption to suppose that they can at times extend the mantle of their own invisibility to cover favored mortals. The common Homeric method is by wrapping men in a cloud,48 and Erwin Rohde49 lists such cases as those of Paris hidden by Aphrodite,50 Aeneas by Apollo,5' Idaeus by Hephaestus,52 Hector by Apollo,53 Aeneas by Poseidon,54 Antenor by Apollo55--so far all Trojan heroes-, and the two Moliones 45 To the cases collected in my notes on Virg.

In actual historic times Silius58 represents Hannibal at Cannae as carried in a cloud to another part of the field. The experience of British and Ger- man forces in the Libyan campaign at present raging indicates the use which may be made of such atmospheric conditions by shrewd commanders. This principle is not, however, limited to the crises of battle, for in the Odyssey we may note the conceal- ment of Odysseus in Phaeacia and in Ithaca by divinely sent mists,59 while in other writers Helen is carried by Hermes in folds of air from Troy to Egypt;60 the gods save Phrixus and Helle from sacrifice at the hands of Athamas, and carry them off through the air on the ram with the golden fleece;61 the Argonauts are concealed by Hera as they traverse hostile places ;62 Aeneas and Achates observe Carthage from the cover of a cloud ;3 Liber sends a cloud to save Ino and Melicertes from death;64 Artemis rescues Iphigenia in a cloud at Aulis,65 and similarly Erigona;66 in the Book of Enoch that worthy is taken away in a mist;67 and Josephus68 describes a mist as thrown by God to prevent the forces of King Ben-hadad from seeing Elisha-this mist being, as Dr. Ralph Marcus has observed,69 a rationalistic 6 II.

De An. 50. 78 Sea deities thus vanish in Apollon. Rhod. IV 865 (Thetis); IV. 1590 (Triton). Cf. also Hylas at the fountain (Theocr. 13, and other passages cited by Stein in PW IX (1916), 111-113), Scamander (Schol. Dan. Aen. III io8), Sarnus (n. 161 infra), the hero Bormus (Athen. XIV 62oa), and Euthymus the Locrian (Ael. V. H. VIII 18). Some thought Aeneas thus disappeared (Dion. Hal. Antiq. I 64. 4-5; Schol. Juv. II. 63). See also the story of Glaucus (Schol. Plat. Rep.

Might it be further suggested that these are due to the romanticizing of various unsolved disappearances by drowning or by being lost in the wilds? Cf. CIL VI 29195 (= Dessau 8482): hic situs est M. Ulpius Firmus A. 1. anima bona superis reddita, raptus a Nymphis, vix. ann. VIII, m. VI.

Or the one disappear- ing may be a mortal, as Daphne (Schol. Dan. Aen. III 91), Laodice, daughter of Priam (H6fer in Roscher, Ausf. Lex. II (1894), 1830), Empedocles (discussed below), or Curtius (Stein in PW, IV (1901), 1864-1865). Note also the case of the Christian Thecla (Acts of Paul and Thecla, fin.), and the mass destruc- tion of Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and their followers (Numbers 16. 28-34), or of seven thousand worshippers of the viper-god (Acts of Philip). Various other cases of beings (Trophonius, Caeneus, Althaemenes, Amphilochus) swallowed up by the earth and thereafter regarded as chthonic deities (or at least as having achieved immortality) are collected by Rohde, op. cit. I4 (1907), II3- 118, who distinguishes between this form of H6hlenentriickung and transporta- tion to the Isles of the Blest or to Elysium, and (p. 121) definitely connects the first-mentioned type with the phenomenon of incubatio, arising, like it, in the post-Homeric period. Further F. Pfister (Der Reliquienkult im Altertum, II (1912), 480) distinguishes between the regard paid to those who have gone up to heaven (Ovdlat) and that rendered to chthonic beings (ivayliara). For the motif of swallowing in the earth as it appears in oaths or appeals cf. A. S. Pease on Virg. Aen. IV 24. Deaths by lightning are considered by Rohde (op. cit.

The purpose may vary from divinely inflicted punish- ment85 to "protective arrest," escape from enemies, suicide, or the passage to a higher, even to a divine, level of existence. Thus Strabo86 says that some mythographers declared that Dio- medes was caused to disappear and his comrades were turned to happy and almost human birds on the Islands of Diomedes, but Eusebius87 tells us that the translation of Enoch was that of the "true man," taken up by God to be his friend. From such translation which makes human beings the com- panions of deity to that which carries man himself to a divine state is no long step, and to draw the line between the immor- tality of the soul after the death of the physical body and the happy eternity of superhuman beings was not always easy. Ancestor-worship, the uncertain status of hybrid beings with one divine and one human parent, Euhemeristic rationalizing of the gods as deceased and subsequently deified human bene- factors or rulers-all these, added to the basic and obvious in- visibility of man's spirit both before and after death, may have contributed to the notion that full attainment of invisibility, with the presence of a material corpse no longer standing as an obstacle to belief in the complete withdrawal of the personality of its former occupant,88 forms a guarantee of his divinity.

We may, then, I think, contrast theophany, in which the god temporarily assumes a visible and quasi-material form,90 with disappearance, in which man is imagined as putting on the divine. Each is, in a sense, characterized by that metamorphosis so dear to the thought of the Hellenistic and following ages, which is exemplified in literary form by authors like Parthenius in Greek and Ovid and Apuleius in Latin.91 "He disappeared and was worshipped as a hero (or as a god)"; this is the statement recurring again and again through antiquity,92 clearly indicating the association of invisibility and divinity.93 Origen94 reports that Celsus de- clared that a Jew had alleged that descents to the underworld and rising again are mere tricks of jugglery; the heroes had dis- appeared for a time and then gave themselves out to have re- turned from Hades. Such, he continues, were Orpheus, Pro- tesilaus, Heracles,95 and Theseus. Others in Greek tradition who similarly vanished and were deified are Dionysus,96 Ganymedes,97 90 As in the case of Jesus in the presence of Thomas (John 20. 24-28). 91 E.g., [Lucian], Asinus 54, where the ass vanishes and Lucius appears restored in his human form. 92 Cf.

VI 9. 7-8; Cleomedes hides in a 'chest, is not to be found when the chest is opened, and is declared by the Pythia worthy of honor as a hero. Plutarch in this passage (cf. Paus. IX 16. 7; Diod.

The deification of Romulus, the founder of so mighty a city, merits especial attention and forms a very typical case. A significant passage in Livy"4 declares: "The concession is granted to anti- quity that by mingling things human with things divine it may ennoble the foundings of cities, and if any people should be allowed to hallow its origins and to trace them back to the gods, such is the military glory of the Roman people that, when it boasts of Mars as its parent and that of its founder, the races of men should allow this claim as willingly as they endure its sovereignty." The deification of Romulus appears as early as Ennius,"11 in the second century B.C.; the tradition of his vanish- ing as early as Cicero."'6 The details of the event vary a good deal; according to some"'7 he was presiding over the Senate con- vened in the precinct of Vulcan; according to others addressing an assembly of the people in the Campus near the Goat's Marsh.118 In the latter version the sun failed and a furious storm dispersed the multitude, but not the senators,119 and after the storm easy opportunity for a legend of his having vanished, and the situation with Latinus was not dissimilar. 110 Fest. p. 194 M.

In what follows, three elements are to be noted, though their sequence may be variously inter- preted and disputed: (I) a story that Romulus had been caught up into heaven;120 (2) a conflicting tradition that, during the storm, he had been made away with by the disaffected senators ;121 (3) a sworn declaration to the people by an intimate friend of Romulus named Proculus Iulius (a descendant of Ascanius122) that the deified Romulus, who willed henceforth to be called Quirinus,123 had appeared to him on the road or in a garden,124 announced his own divinity, and predicted the future greatness of the city of Rome. The lack of any Latin shrine of Romulus and the inadequate character of the so-called "grave of Romulus" in the Roman Forum (Varro ap. Porphyr. ad Hor. Epod. 16. 13; Fest. p. 177 M.) are suggested by Pfister (Woch. f. kl. Philol. XXVIII (1911), 85) as reasons for the origin of a legend of his vanishing. So far vanishing figures have fallen in considerable measure in the field of popular legend, or, in the case of early Roman kings, in that of literary imitation of such. But the principle was too suggestive to be overlooked in periods like the age of Alexander or the early Roman Empire, when every occasion for glorifying and legitimizing the ruling dynasty was eagerly sought. Arrian, in a passage to be later discussed,125 shows this motive already at work in the case of Alexander himself, and with Julius Caesar it is reborn. He had obviously died a purely human death, 120 Liv. I 16. 2: sublimem raptum. 121 Liv. I 16. 4; Dion. Hal. Antiq. II 56. 3-4 (alleging reasons for the murder); Val. Max. V 3. I; Flor. I I.

But I cannot further discuss ordinary cases of emperor-worship, in which the Emperor appears as a god in very presence (OEbs tir4av?is, deus praesens)"' and so presumably capable at death of divine invisibility. I merely wish to empha- size the principle of having appearances after death attested by oath or by one or more witnesses,138 a practice of which Tertullian in a badly corrupted passage,'39 seems to speak with scorn. In the cases thus far discussed disappearance may or may not profit the one who vanishes, but is either brought about by divine interposition in his behalf or asserted about him by other human beings, in either case without his own distinct volition. My next group comprises those who, without deliberate recourse to magic, yet actively sought by mysterious disappearances to encourage the belief that their invisibility was an evidence of their own divinity. Thus the Thracian Zamolxis, after teaching his countrymen a belief in the immortality of the soul, hid in an underground chamber for three years, was mourned as dead, and reappeared in the fourth year."40 Tertullian and Suidas141 have 136 De Morte Peregr. 40.

So Orpheus, Protesilaus, Heracles, and Theseus, with whom he compared Jesus, had indulged in such disappearances. Gregory of Nazianzus144 similarly declares that Heracles, Aristaeus, Empedotimus, and Trophonius had sought glory by hiding away in inaccessible spots, but had won more contempt from being discovered than glory from their con- cealment.145 The Carthaginian Hamilcar, after his defeat by Gelo in 480 B.C., could nowhere be found, dead or alive, and his countrymen declared that when he saw his army routed he threw himself on the sacrificial fires and was completely consumed and hence no more seen, but received honors of sacrifice, apparently as a god.146 More famous is one tradition of the disappearance of the philosopher Empedocles, who, having dreamed that he was a god,147 and having declared that the divine cannot be ap- proached by our eyes or grasped by our hands,148 in the dead of night149 leaped into the crater of Mt.

Various cases of Germanic kings at death going while still alive into the earth where they were supposed to continue to live are discussed by Hermann Usener in his K1. Schriften, IV (1913), 200. Perhaps suggested by the legend of Empedocles is the statement of Arrian,158 that an unnamed writer, in discussing the death of Alexander the Great, had asserted that when Alexander knew that his end was near he went to throw himself into the Euphrates, so that he might disappear from among men and leave a more credible tradition to posterity that his birth was from a god and his passing away (a7rox'piaur) was to the gods.

The archenchantress Medea163 had already, in the age of legend, cast a mist over the eyes of the daughters of Pelias to delude them as to her real purposes, but the instances to be particularly noted here belong to the later recrudescence of obscurantism and theurgy in the early centuries of our era, represented in the New Testament and the early Fathers by the figure of Simon Magus,164 who desired to be reckoned a god165 and who professed the power to become invisible and visible again at will.166 Apollonius of Tyana, also, had, in his travels, found at the castle of the Hindu sages the 159 Clem.

Yet such magical escapes appear elsewhere, e.g., in that of Papa narrated by Ammianus Marcellinus,170 or in that ascribed to the magician Virgil by the AMirabilia Urbis Romae'71 of the twelfth century. A particularly curious case is described by Irenaeus,172 who says of certain disciples of the heretic and magician Marcus that because of their "redemption" (aoXLVrpWaLs)173 they cannot be arrested for their deeds or seen by the judge. If arrested they repeat a formula: "O thou who sittest beside God (i.e., Sophia ?), and the mystical, eternal Silence (Sige), .... behold the judge is at hand and the crier orders me to make my defence. But do thou, as knowing the affairs of both, present the cause of both of us to the judge, since it is really but one cause." Now as soon as the Mother hears these words she puts the Homeric174 helmet of Pluto upon them, so that they may invisibly escape the judge. And then she at once catches them up, conducts them to the bridal-chamber, and hands them over to their consorts.

Not easily classified is the curious case of the Emperor Justinian, who was begotten, as his mother told her intimate friends, of a demon. When Justinian walked about, his head would at times disappear while his body still went on, and later the head was restored again.1"6 As the methods of divine disappearance have varied, with the employment of cloud, storm, dust, water, etc., so the magical technique of voluntary human invisibility has had its various forms. The famous story of the ring taken from the hand of a corpse in a hollow bronze horse in a chasm underground by an ancestor of Gyges, the Lydian-another story smacking of the Orient and of the flavor of the Arabian Nights, though E. Miiller'77 has tried to find its origin in a volcanic myth-, is told by Plato178 and copied from him by Cicero'79 and other writers.180 As Gyges turned the ring about on his finger at a public gathering he be- came invisible, and was spoken of by his companions as though absent; on turning the ring back he again became visible.

Weicher suggests'8' that the legend may rest on an official Lydian tradition according to which the founder of the new dynasty was a god. A similar motif is found in the ring of Midas, mentioned by the Elder Pliny,'82 which makes its wearer invisible, and K. F. Smith'83 has studied this story in relation to that of Gyges. The same principle appears frequently in me- diaeval tradition.'84 Other objects with the power of conferring invisibility include the stone called heliotropium,'85 a leek-green gem, mottled with red veins, found in Ethiopia, Africa, and Cyprus, and used for various purposes, but which the magicians say can be mixed with the plant of the same name, and, when accompanied by certain incantations, can render invisible who- ever carries it. The converse of this might seem to be the stone found in the head of Indian serpents and called dracontitis, of which Philostratus'86 says that it has a power opposite to that of the ring of Gyges. Pliny'"' calls it draconitis and dracontia, and says that it must be cut from the living snake while the reptile sleeps. Its powers are undoubtedly connected with those of the bright eyes of the snake itself.'88 The possession of a pupula duplexis' was also a proof against obscuring powers like those of the ring of Gyges.

"192 "Take the egg of a hawk, gild one-half and paint the other with cinnabar. Carry this and you will be invisible if you speak the name in addition.'""93 In another passage the magic power seems to reside solely in the incantation to the primal darkness (7r 6rpworoqacs aKobro).14 The favorite later method of procuring invisibility by the use of fern- seed, gathered on Mid-summer Eve and worn in the shoe,'95 seems not to be attested for antiquity.

Forms of headdress which provide invisibility appear from as early as the time of Homer,"' who makes Athena, to avoid being seen by Ares, don the cap or helmet of Hades-in which phrase Hades "evidently preserves something of its original sense, the Invisible ('AfL6ast)."198 In the pseudo-Hesiodic Scutum,199 Perseus wears this same object which has the awful gloom of night, and which appears also, in a comic sense, on Hieronymus in the Acharnians of Aristophanes,200 and is mentioned, along with the ring of Gyges, by Plato in the Republic,201 as well as by Lucian,202 while Apollodorus describes it as worn by Hermes,203 certain nymphs,204 and Perseus.205 Similar objects, such as the "Tarn- kappe" and the magic cloak of Manannan, are found in many other cultures, including Germanic, Norse, Italian, and Kal- muck.206 It has been suggested,207 with a moderate degree of plausibility, that some of these concealments connected with clothing may have originally arisen from different but rather simple types of disguises. After these general illustrations taken chiefly from Greek and Roman antiquity (with a few from the Old Testament), I should like to consider briefly some of the cases of invisibility described 197 II.

In the Synoptic accounts of the Trans- figuration,208 at the summit of a high mountain, the beginning of the incident is imperfectly described. The face of Jesus, present with the three disciples, Peter, James, and John (who appear in all three accounts as witnesses), becomes suddenly shining and his clothes white and glistening. Then, in some un- explained manner, there appear the two additional figures of Moses and Elias, their selection probably being made not merely on the ground that they had been great national heroes-in which r6le Abraham or David might almost equally well have qualified-but because they too had passed from earth in a mysterious and supernatural manner.209 Moses had died on Mt. Pisgah,210 by a death similar to the passing of Oedipus, the site of his sepulchre being known to none, though Josephus211 makes him at death disappear into a ravine. "But," continues Josephus, "he has written of himself212 that he died, lest they should venture to say that by reason of his surpassing virtue he had gone back to the deity." The translation of Elijah213 had been a more spectacular event, viewed either by Elisha alone or perhaps also by fifty sons of the prophets.214 Imitations of the Transfiguration occur in later Christian imagination, for example in the Acts of Peter and Andrew,215 where Andrew was snatched up by a luminous cloud to a mountain where sat Peter, Matthew, and Alexander, or in the Acts of Andrew and Matthias, where Andrew commanded a cloud which took up Matthias and the disciples of Andrew and set them on the mountain beside Peter.

The Gospel accounts of the Crucifixion seem to rest on a firmer foundation of historic fact, yet even here the attempt to introduce the motif of supernatural invisibility is early found. This was not, to be sure, under cover of the darkness lasting from the sixth to the ninth hour,216 but in the early second century the Gnostic Basilides217 maintained that Simon of Cyrene, who carried the cross for Jesus,218 was actually the one crucified, while Jesus, as an incorporeal power, who could transform himself as he willed, took the form of Simon, laughed at his captors, and ascended invisibly to God who had sent him. Somewhat later Marcion219 asserted that Christ, the son of God, was manifested in appearance only, and experienced neither birth nor passion, save in appearance, while Noetus,220 in the third century, identi- fying the Father and the Son, declared that Christ died in appear- ance only and raised himself on the third day. It would have helped to show the divinity of Jesus, Celsus quotes a Jew as saying,221 if he had at once miraculously disappeared from the cross. But this would, of course, have diminished his human- not to say his historic-character, though Origen, in defence of his divinity, cites his vanishing from Simon and Cleopas at Emmaus222 as a sufficient indication of his power to become invisible. Pos- sibly the Jew's words may reflect the Gospel statement223 that the Jews asserted that the body of Jesus had been stolen from the tomb by his disciples. 216 Matt. 27. 45; Mark 15. 33; Luke 23. 44. H. J. Rose (Harv. Theol. Rev. XXXI (1938), 137-138) observes that only Luke calls this an eclipse; but an eclipse would not have lasted three hours. 217 Iren. C. Haeres.

The fuller shut up his shop and went to tell the dead man's kinsmen, but the report of the death of Aristeas, now noised through the city, was disputed by a man of Cyzicus, who had come from the seaport of Cyzicus and said that he had met Aristeas going toward the town and had spoken with him. While he so spoke, the kinsmen of the dead man came to the fuller's shop with all that was needful for the burial, but when the shop was opened no Aristeas was there, either dead or alive. Seven years later Aristeas appeared at Proconnesus and made that poem which the Greeks later called the Arimaspea, after which he again vanished. The same story is quoted, with some further details, from Celsus by Origen,227 with the statement that though Apollo had enjoined the people of Metapontum to regard Aristeas as a god yet no one so considers him. This account, says Origen, Celsus seems to have taken from Pindar and Herodotus. Plutarch228 also briefly narrates the tale, and adds that the boxer Cleomedes of Astypalaea229 went mad, pulled down (like Samson) the pillar that supported a roof, and so killed sixty children. Then, when stoned by the indignant people, 224 Cf. Lake, op. cit. 56, on the universal early Christian opinion that the story of the Resurrection necessarily implied that the tomb was empty (cf. n. 250 infra). Luke 24. 2-3 emphasizes this view because his work is partly, at least, directed against the Docetic heresy, according to which (Iren. C. Haeres. I 30. 13 (Patr. Gr. VII 702)) Christ withdrew and Jesus was crucified. 226 F. Pfister, Der Reliquienkult im Altertum, II (1912), 488-489, who does not treat in detail the Resurrection of Jesus, yet raises the question whether the tradition in regard to it is a spontaneous growth, like similar ones about Greek heroes (i.e., an aetiological legend to explain the absence of physical remains of Jesus), or a story based by analogy upon Hellenistic and Roman apotheoses, which saw in translation the highest honor which could be ascribed to one dead. He admits both possibilities, but seems to incline to the second. 226 IV 14. 227 C. Cels. III 26; III 29 (on the failure to treat Aristeas as a god).

When this was with great difficulty opened no Cleomedes was found, but the Pythia bade the Astypalaeans honor him as a hero. A somewhat similar curious disappearance of the sortes Praenestinae from the chest in which they were regularly kept when Tiberius attempted to interfere with the cult of their famous temple by removing them to Rome is described by Suetonius.230 Plutarch, in his catalogue of such cases,231 relates that the corpse of Alcmene disappeared while being carried forth for burial, and in its place on the bier was found a stone. "In short," he says, "many such fables are told by writers who im- probably ascribe divinity to the mortal features in human nature as well as to the divine. At any rate, to reject entirely the divinity of human virtue were impious and base, but to mix heaven with earth is foolish. . . . We must not, therefore, violate nature by sending the bodies of good men with their souls to heaven, but implicitly believe that their virtues and their souls, in accordance with nature and divine justice, ascend from men to heroes." In the cases just mentioned a body or a corpse closely confined mysteriously disappears, in the instance of Aristeas with a subsequent epiphany and a subsequent vanishing.232 In the case of Zeus himself we learn that his tomb was exhibited at Cnossus in Crete233-doubtless to the concern and confusion of some worshippers-, though he himself had become a god in heaven. A different type of illustration is afforded by Heracles, whose sufferings and glorification after death have not infrequently been compared to those associated with Jesus. This comparison appears as early as Justin Martyr,234 in the second century, and most recently by the German philologist Pfister,235 who suggests 230 Tib. 63. 231 Rom. 28. 6-8. 232 After the battle of Lake Trasimenus the body of Flaminius disappeared, none knew how.

XXXI (1938), 113-142) should certainly not be overlooked.</page><page sequence="31">Some Aspects of Invisibility 31 that the composer of the Urevangelium had before him a Cynic- Stoic biography of Heracles. Diodorus236 relates that the pyre which Heracles had ascended on Mt. Oeta was lighted by Philoctetes at his command but also by lightning which fell from heaven and wholly consumed it. According to Servius,237 Heracles earnestly entreated Philoctetes not to show the remains of his body to anyone, and when the companions came to gather up the bones of the hero and found not a single bone anywhere,238 they assumed that, in accordance with the words of the oracle, he had passed from among men into the company of the gods. This is a more rationalistic account than that of Apollodorus,239 in which, during the burning of the pyre, Heracles is wafted by a cloud to heaven, in a manner which some have thought sug- gestive of the description in the first chapter of Acts,240 where Jesus is taken up into heaven and received by a cloud out of the sight of the disciples.

It should be observed that in the Gospel narratives it is viewed either by Mary Magdalen,241 by the two Marys,242 or by the two Marys and one other woman,243 and, in some accounts, later inspected by Peter244 or by Peter and John.245 The attempt to emphasize the evidence for the disappearance of the body from the tomb, by means of the testi- mony of the regular Jewish number of two or three witnesses,246 236 IV 38. 4-5. 237 Aen.

Further, the introduction into the story of a mysterious young man in white,249 of an angel,250 or of two angels,251 who explain more precisely the absence of the body of Jesus, seems due, first, to a desire more fully to stress the truth of the disappearance,252 and, secondly, to introduce a super- natural element into what had been by some explained as merely human molestation of the tomb.253 During the period between the Resurrection and the Ascension supernatural disappearance is not lacking. In the beautiful account, found in full form only in Luke,254 of the two disciples, Simon and Cleopas, on the journey to Emmaus,255 the identity of the stranger who joined and conversed with them was concealed because their eyes were holden (iKparoivro)256 that they should not know him, but at the moment when they finally recognized him 247 Cf. the report of the watchmen in Matt. 28. I I. 248 Orig. C. Cels. II 70. 249 Mark 16. 5-7 (the earliest form). Some have thought the young man was Jesus himself; cf. Lake, op. cit. 186. 250 Matt. 28. 2-7; Gospel of Peter, 13. H. J. Rose (Harv. Theol. Rev. XXXI (1938), 140) suggests the following reasoning in the formation of the tradition: Jesus was not dead, therefore his body was not in the tomb, therefore someone must have found the tomb empty; there had been a miracle, therefore a super- natural agency had been operative, therefore the presence of angels was assumed. Id., 141: "The details, as given in our authorities, are the most natural results possible of the inevitable attempt to form a mental picture of what had happened." Cf. also n. 224 supra. 251 Luke 24. 4-7; 24. 23; John 20. 12-13. These angels were in the Ascension of Isaiah identified with Michael and Gabriel; Lake, op. cit. I85. 252 Tert. Adv. Marc. IV 43, stresses the two angels at the tomb, the number required for valid testimony. 253 Matt. 27. 64; 28. 13-15 gives clear indications of this latter belief on the part of the Jews. Is it significant that this view is especially recognized in a gospel intended particularly for Jewish readers? 254 Yet cf. Mark I6. 12-13. Lake, op. cit. 219, remarks that Luke belonged to a strongly anti-Docetic group. 255 Luke 24. 13-31. 256 Luke 24. 16.</page><page sequence="33">Some Aspects of Invisibility 33 he vanished out of their sight.257 The number of the witnesses is here again significant, even though Mark258 admits that the other disciples disbelieved their account of the incident. Augustine259 explains their failure to recognize Jesus as due to the same type of aopaoia as that with which the Syrians were smitten when ensnared by Elisha and brought captive into Samaria.260 In the appearance of Jesus to the eleven disciples, as told in the Synoptic Gospels,261 he comes suddenly and without warning; in Matthew nothing is said of his departure or of the Ascension; in Mark262 and Luke263 he is parted from them and carried up into heaven.264 The Fourth Gospel describes three appearances of Jesus after the Resurrection,265 but in no case is there any allusion to his vanishing or to the Ascension. The Book of Acts, however, specifically describes266 the Ascension into the clouds267-an ac- count perhaps influenced by the ascension of Elijah in II Kings, 2. 11-12-, and here again, as at the empty tomb, appear two 257 Luke 24. 31; cf.

Lake (op. cit. 234) would place the change from flesh to spirit at the Resurrection, according to Paul, but at the Ascension, according to Luke. 264 Paul appears in I Thess. 4. 17, to expect a similar translation of living Christians at the last trump. 265 John 20. 19-25; 20. 26-31; 21. 1-25 (especially 21.14). In Acts 1. 3, the period between Resurrection and Ascension is forty days; in Paul the two seem to coincide (Lake, The Beginnings of Christianity, V (1933), 18), as in the Epistle of Barnabas, 15. 9 (called to my notice by Professor Hatch). 266 I. 2-I I, with two men in white raiment partly in the position of witnesses. 267 [Lact.] De Mort.

Very considerable likenesses to the Transfiguration, Resurrection, and Ascension are to be seen in the story of the ascension of Raphael in Tobit 12. 16-22, where see the note of D. C. Simpson in R.

Or, as Pfister270 puts the problem for classical antiquity, does legend develop from cult or cult from legend? From the same Biblical data the Fundamentalist and the Modernist and the Sceptic will answer these questions in quite different ways. It may, however, be not unfairly observed that the Crucifixion in itself, as distinguished from the Trans- figuration and the Ascension, contains, in its essential features, little that is miraculous,271 such elements appearing after the 268 Disappearances of disciples and followers of Jesus include the rescues from prison of the apostles (Acts 5. 19-23) and of Peter by himself (Acts 12. 7-IO; 12. 18)-these both belonging in the large class of supernaturally opened doors, for which see 0. Weinreich in Genethliacon W. Schmid . . . dargebracht, Stuttgart, 1929, 200-452-, and the vanishing of Philip from the eunuch (Acts 8. 39-40). Procop. De Aedif. I 4. 8, tells of the bodies of Andrew, Luke, and Timothy, which had previously been invisible, coming into sight at Constantinople. The numerous cases in later hagiography I have not at- tempted to collect, though noteworthy are that of the Assumption of Mary, which seems to be probably an analogy from the Ascension of Jesus, and to date from the fifth century (Pfister in Arch. f. Religionswiss. XXXIV (1937), 56-57) or even earlier (cf. H6nn, op. cit., 32, n. IIo; Rose in Harv. Theol. Rev. XXXI (1938), 124; also n. 101 supra), and that of St. Thecla (cf. n. 79 supra), whose translation may be the outgrowth of a lack of any grave associated with her (S. Guyer in Woch. f. kl. Philol. XXVI (1909), 963). Among later saints and martyrs the principle seems not to be lacking. 269 E.g., Lake, The Hist. Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ (1907), 195, thinks the empty tomb no evidence for resurrection but a deduction from belief in the Resurrection. On p. 241 he notes that the emptiness of the tomb was inferred by the Galilean disciples from the Resurrection, but the Resur- rection was inferred by the women from the empty tomb, or rather from the declaration of the young man there. 270 Woch. f. kl. Philol. XXVIII (1911), 84. He believes that legend usually arises from cult, though he would make allowance for some cases as due to reasoning by analogy. 271 The darkness, earthquake, and opening tombs seem a later addition,</page><page sequence="35">Some Aspects of Invisibility 35 death of Jesus, in the presence of the empty tomb, where no relic of his physical body could become the object of cultus, and when there must have been many opportunities and powerful motives for emphasizing his divinity by the ascription to him of what were generally considered superhuman attributes. That one of these attributes was the power of supernatural appearance and disappearance, a faculty alleged to have been the property of many unusual personages of his own and other cultural traditions, would probably be admitted by adherents of any school of thought. Gods, heroes-or, in Christian parlance, saints-, and men we have seen represented as either permanently or temporarily endowed with the faculty of invisibility. In the case of human beings this power may be either vouchsafed by superhuman agencies, as a tribute to human merit or human need, or deliber- ately achieved by natural means by those covetous of divine prerogatives, or sought by magical jugglery and theurgy. While the results of these three methods may appear superficially identical, the motives informing them and the credibility of the accounts concerning them are obviously quite distinct. For the accurate interpretation of any one instance of invisibility it should also be constantly born in mind that those whose vanishing has become a matter of tradition may, in many instances, have been themselves quite innocent of any such intention, the tradi- tions having arisen from subsequent narration, first at the instance of admiring and well-meaning friends, and later through dis- semination by a public delighting in the dramatic, the unexpected, and the marvellous, and not overcritical in its application of logical or scientific criteria of truth. Hence, as with other forms of the miraculous, the superficial ascription of more than human powers is no sufficient evidence against an underlying historicity. For example, no one doubts the historic character of Alexander the Great or of the Roman Emperors, though we may fairly doubt particular incidents about them which ancient writers, relying upon popular tradition, may have reported. Finally, not at all essential to the original stratum of the story. Only Matthew knows the earthquake and opened tombs.</page><page sequence="36">36 Arthur Stanley Pease may we not modify a well-known aphorism, and safely venture the assertion that the ascription of miraculous powers has gen- erally been the unconscious tribute which inferiority has paid to excellence ?272 272 I have not here thought it needful to collect instances of the mysterious disappearance of brute animals (cf. n. 71 supra), such as those sacrificed at the source of the Jordan River (Euseb. H. E. VII 17. I), of a lion described by Damascius (Vit. Isid. ap. Phot. Bibl. 242, p. 348 Bekk.), or of the snake brought from Epidaurus to the Insula Tiberina at Rome ([Acro] in Hor. Serm. I 3. 27; cf. n. 92 supra). Nor do I deal with invisible weapons (J. A. Mac- Culloch in J. Hastings, Encycl. of Relig. and Ethics, VII (1915), 406, n. 3), nor yet with the employment of invisible ink (e.g., Plin. N. H. XXVI 62; Hippol. Philosophum. IV 28; Cedren., Hist. Compend., pp. 280-281 (Patr. Gr. CXXII 12); W. Sfiss in Philol. LXXVIII (1923), 142-175). In the preparation of this paper I have received very helpful suggestions at several points from Professor W.
