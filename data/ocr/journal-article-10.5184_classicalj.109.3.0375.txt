Its discussion of the Aeneid deftly shows why the poem  has been interpreted so diversely. Fitzgerald gives his Latin-less reader exposure  to the power of the original Latin when he states, “It is no coincidence that the  word used when Aeneas sinks his sword into Turnus is the same as the word for  founding the Roman race (condere)...” (158).    “Lucan and Seneca: Poets of Apocalypse” traces the theme of fratricide (and,  by extension, civil strife) through Lucan’s Civil War and Seneca’s Thyestes, using  Catullus’ Poem 101 to his brother as counterpoint. Finally, in “Science Fiction:  Lucretius’ De Rerum Natura and Ovid’s Metamorphoses” Fitzgerald explores epic  as a vehicle for two very different visions of the world.    I recommend this book highly for its target audience of Latin-less readers. In  addition, it will provide Latinists with many fresh readings as well as techniques  for making Latin poetry more compelling and accessible to all.

Pp. xix + 300. $99.00 ISBN 978-110702-676-6.    Hopman’s provocative study, exemplary as both reception project and mythog- raphy, reads Scylla semiotically in order to map the name’s semantics from the  archaic age through late antiquity. In considering Scylla as sign, the author ex- plores her meanings in historically distinct visual and verbal contexts instead of  treating her as a biographically consistent character or charting her narrative  functions in “at least three conceptual domains: sea, dog, and woman” (12).  Hopman’s analysis of Scylla as a complex symbol not only offers an alternative to  pervasive narratological methods of interpreting mythical ‘figures’, but challenges  their applicability to Scylla and, by extension, other mythical names that occur in  varied positions throughout diverse narratives. Further, the argument traces to  late antiquity mythographic methods that treat mythical names as ‘figures’ and  casts doubt upon the conclusions they produce.     </page> <page sequence="2"> 376 BOOK REVIEWS    The chapters follow a tripartite chronological organization prefaced by an  introduction that establishes the semiotic grounding of the project, mentions the  philosophical lineage it implicates (3–4), and outlines the book’s broader signifi- cance. After an explication and inter-textual reading of the Odyssey’s Scylla epi- sode, Hopman considers Scylla representations of the classical era; the Hellenis- tic origins of her mythography; and her reception in Roman poetry. The epilogue  concludes that Mischwesen (hybrids) like Scylla differ from anthropomorphic  immortals in that Mischwesen lack agency to initiate narrative sequences.    Scylla’s introduction thoroughly justifies the sophisticated bricolage of  Hopman’s methods, drawn from Saussurean linguistics, the works of Jakobson,  Barthes, Jauss, Vernant, Geertz, and, to a lesser extent, Freud via Horney and oth- er epigones. The first section interprets the Homeric Scylla episode as heroic  failure: Odysseus falls short of Jason when his inability to best Scylla, portrayed as  a “failed cosmogonic battle” (33), contrasts structurally with his triumph over  Polyphemus (34–39).    Hopman stresses the language of forgetting in Odysseus’s narration of Scyl- la’s attack as meta-poetic threats to the song additionally emphasize Odysseus’s  failure. There is danger that Odysseus will forget his nostos, and this danger re- flects analogous meta-poetic hazards to the performance. Scylla remains such an  unconquerable monster in later receptions, in Hopman’s view, in that only one  “eccentric”, Hellenistic story recounts a hero’s victory over the beast (51). Hop- man highlights Scylla’s canine voracity in the Odyssey and details its relation to  descriptions of the sea in archaic contexts. She then considers the monster’s en- igmatic nature and argues that Scylla fuses elements of mystery, which the epic  consistently codes as feminine, with anthropophagous voracity typically gen- dered as masculine. The section left me pondering the implications of this fusion  and possible reasons behind it.   Part II argues that while the Odyssey “keeps Scylla’s gender relatively sub- dued” (88), classical representations use Scylla to signify anxieties about female  sexuality. Hopman voices due skepticism that a lost Stesichorus poem deter- mined visual representations of Scylla (93–94). Instead, she contends that the  visual type derives from merman images (99). Hopman shows that visual ele- ments comprising Scylla (woman’s torso, dog protomes, fishlike tail) correspond  semantically with verbal descriptions (107).    Textual sources (notably Aeschylus’s Oresteia and Euripides’s Medea) use  Scylla to represent the danger of female sexuality, while Scylla comes to designate  sexual voracity in Xenophon and predatory sexuality in Anaxilas. Hopman, citing  </page> <page sequence="3">  BOOK REVIEWS 377  the vagina dentata as parallel (138–39), establishes textual and iconographic  equivalents between Scylla’s mouth, the straits in which she resides, and the fe- male genitals. She also shows that Scylla often symbolizes a danger to parthenoi in  their transition to marriage. She gives particular attention to Thetis, a foil, in  Hopman’s view, often juxtaposed to Scylla. While Thetis protects the metaphori- cal “passage” of the parthenos to marriage, Scylla, as canine embodiment of un- domesticated erotic passion, threatens its successful navigation.    The book’s third section elucidates how allegorizing and rationalizing inter- pretations of Scylla by philosophers, historians, and geographers influenced later  poetic representations. Scylla becomes moral abstraction (Plato), misunder- stood historical courtesan (Heraclitus the Paradoxographer), and toponym  (Tzetzes) (184–88). Empirical rationality and the logical criterion of non- contradiction result in a homogenization of Scylla’s diverse tradition (195–200),  while biographical models attempt to reconcile ‘discrepancies’ in her genealogy  by distinguishing Megarian Scylla from the sea monster.    Hopman convincingly traces the implications of mythic rationalizing. She  details in nuanced terms, how, why, and with what consequence Virgil, Ovid, and  Propertius self-consciously conflate the two Scyllae. Scylla becomes oxymo- ron—maiden as monster— the psychological epitome of female ferocity. While  Scylla’s exemplum in Roman poetry becomes formulaic, Ovid, Hopman shows,  psychologizes Scylla, whose novel semantics in Metamorphoses depend upon  inter- and intra-textual effects.      This outstanding work of scholarship is valuable for the specific case it pre- sents and for its challenge to established methods of reading mythic ‘figures’.  Hopman elucidates both the homogenizing impetus of late antiquity and the  flexibility of tradition. There is stimulating tension between Hopman’s own bid  to unify under the sea/dog/woman synthesis, which tends toward abstraction,  and her appreciation of the fluidity of myth.    Thus, while I agree about the eccentricity of a late source in which Heracles  defeats Scylla (51), Hopman’s limited treatment of the only extant archaic depic- tion of Scylla in visual art (35) leaves unaddressed the “octopus-like” (35) mon- ster’s lack of the supposedly ubiquitous “woman” semantic marker, as well as the  questionable dogginess of its heads. Perhaps archaic depictions are even more  flexible than Hopman allows? The book’s central claims, whether they meet with  agreement or disagreement, will continue to inspire questions and debate among  specialists. Scylla deserves praise for originality, versatility, and intellectual depth.    </page> <page sequence="4"> 378 BOOK REVIEWS     ERIC DODSON-ROBINSON   West Chester University, EDodson-Robinson@wcupa.edu.         * * *   The Roman Agricultural Economy: Organization, Investment, and Production. By  ALAN BOWMAN and ANDREW WILSON (eds.). Oxford Studies on the Roman  Economy. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013. Pp. 333. Hardcover, $150.  ISBN 978-0-19-966572-3.    Preindustrial economies were firmly rooted in soil. In such “organic” economies  the majority of people worked in agriculture in one way or another, and the bulk  of trade depended on what came off the land, whether in raw material or manu- factured goods. It is therefore fitting that the third volume resulting from the Ox- ford Roman Economy Project (OXREP) should be devoted to the Roman rural  economy, c.100BC–AD 350. The book’s ambition is not limited to highlighting  the importance of agriculture though. It “aims to move substantially beyond the  simple assumption that agriculture was the dominant sector of the ancient econ- omy, and to explore what was special and distinctive about the Roman economy  ... ” (1). It largely succeeds in achieving this aim by way of ten papers, the first of  which, a helpful introduction by the editors, recaps the state of the field and revis- its past approaches and macroeconomic models.    One of only two contributions not to target a specific geographical area is an  important and timely chapter by Dennis Kehoe, who analyzes how the state de- fended its interests and met its fiscal goals. In a balanced discussion, Kehoe re- jects as unsatisfactory the notion of a “predatory” or “tributary” Roman state,  arguing instead that the state consistently instituted fiscal policies and legal in- struments that protected not just large landholders but also small farmers.   In the next chapter, Helen Goodchild explains the use of GIS computer  modeling applied to the Tiber Valley, successfully—though somewhat predicta- bly—showing how different parameters lead to widely different results for agri- cultural surplus production.    Annalisa Marzano follows with two chapters, the first investigating the  amount of wine and oil that Rome received from its hinterland, looking at num- bers of recorded presses.
