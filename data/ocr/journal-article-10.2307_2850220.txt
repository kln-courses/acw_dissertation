OVID'S Nachleben is exceedingly interesting in its development and ramifications. Its manifold mediaeval aspects have been carefully studied by various scholars from various points of view.' In this paper we shall sketch its growth, and ex- amine in detail one phase of his influence, namely the abundant substance which the Metamorphoses furnished the rationalistic commentators of the middle ages. Professor Schevill,2 in the first chapter of his stimulating book, has traced the study of Ovid, and the attitude towards him from the time of Saint Augustine to the Renaissance. No evidence of any systematic study of the works of Ovid during the early centuries of the Christian era has hitherto been found. It is not likely that he was ever wholly forgot- ten, but it seems that the reading of his poetry, chiefly the Metamorphoses, was of a very casual character, and limited to a few students of the classics, widely scattered over Europe. The reason for this is not far to seek: for even if the writings of Ovid had been accessible at the time, it is logical to infer that open reading of them would not have been countenanced in the centers of learning, in the convents or in the schools conducted by the priests and monks. These institutions were dominated entirely by a spirit of reaction against paganism, its philosophers and poets.3 Saint Augustine reproached himself for having enjoyed the classics;4 and they were inveighed against by Gregory the Great, and by Isidore of Seville' (who nevertheless quotes Ovid several times). From this we may conclude that Ovid was never entirely forgotten or unknown. But his general acceptance at an early 1 The separate subjects are briefly mentioned later as they concern us, with the usual documenta- tion, but we may cite here specifically the most recent book: Giovanni Pansa, Ovidio nel medioevo e nella tradizione popolare (Sulmona, 1924), which in its short compass has many suggestions of specific points. Only the first four chapters are really of interest to mediaevalists. i, 'La celebrita d'Ovidio,' pp. 7-15; ii, 'Rinascenza classica nei sec. xi-xiii e culto d'Ovidio, como eponimo, a Sulmona,' pp. 17-28; iii, 'Ovidio mago e filosopho,' pp. 99-41; iv, Ovidio poeta sensualista e dannato; Ovidio cristiano, moralista, profeta e santo,' pp. 43-64. As a helpful key to many of the early forms of inter- pretation we may refer to the article of J. D. Cooke, 'Euhemerism: A Mediaeval Interpretation of Classical Paganism,' SPECULUM, iv (1929), 396-410. 2 Ovid and the Renascence in Spain (University of California Publications in Modern Philology, iv, 1-268) Berkeley, 1918, pp. 6-97. For the early period the evidence is quoted in full in the text; in all cases it is referred to in the footnotes. Cf. also F. E. Guyer, The Influence of Ovid on Chretien de Troyes, diss. unpublished (Chicago, 1920), pp. v-xvii, also carefully attested, and adding such pertinent matter as appeared after Schevill's book. Since these two works are readily available, there seems no need to repeat details here in full, except as they pertain to the direct understanding of Ovidius Magnus Moralizatus. 8 Schevill, op. cit., p. 6.

The first foreshadowing of the change in events appears in Theodolphus, Bishop of Orleans, who believed that under a false exterior there lay hidden truths.2 Traube3 has called the eighth and ninth centuries the aetas Vergiliana, the tenth and eleventh centuries, the aetas Horatiana, and the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the aetas Ovidiana. The predominating position of Vergil in the earlier centuries,4 which accepted him as a Christian seer, strongly militated against the advance of Ovid. But as we have seen, even by the time of the Carolingian Re- naissance, he was making progress, although he did not yet have a place in the school curriculum.5 From then on, his influence on mediaeval writers is easily distinguishable,6 and in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries he came into his own.7 In spite of all attempts to prevent the reading of this poet whose works were 1 Schevill, op. cit., p. 10; Pansa, op. cit., pp. 43-44.

This lays down in three channels currents of influence of which we do not lose the traces through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries' (p. 15). Cf. also M. B.

Therefore the new condition had to be faced, and justified in the eyes of the Church fathers. What was simpler than to model the campaign upon that which had been so successful in the case of Vergil? Ovid was made a part of legend,2 and mediaeval vitae were written to show he was a Christian poet,3 living at Sulmona, and writing with a moral purpose.4 'Da Ovidio moralista 'a Ovidio christiano il passo doveva essere breve.'5 Ovid had now achieved full success. These vitae begin with a quasi-etymological explanation of our author's name; e.g., Ovidius, 'quia rem suam ovanter dicit,' or 'quia ovum dividens'; sicut enim in ovo quatuor sunt, scilicet vitellus sive rubbigo, qui respondet igni, al- bumen sive claretum, quod respondet aeri, cartillago, quae respondet aquae, et testa, quae respondet terrae, et sic Ovidius quatuor elementa distinxit, ut osten- dit in Ovidio maiore [i.e., the Metamorphoses] in principio';6 and Naso, 'quia sicut per nasum fetida ab odoriferis discernimus, ita vitia a virtutibus disgre- gavit,'7 and then pass on to other statements of his life, interweaving fact and fiction.8 In the thirteenth century, then, which especially delighted in allegory,9 we find Ovid the stimulating model of elegiac comedies, of tales, of Goliardic poetry, romance and epic; the essence of chivalry; the inspiration of much that is fine in I Sandys, op.'cit., I, 614.

But it is especially in his functions as Ovidius Ethicus, Theologus, and Magus that we are concerned.2 Especially the mythology of the ancients had gradually come to be regarded as symbolical, thus admitting comparison with symbolical tales employed in Christian teaching; and the Metamorphoses, looked upon as an allegory of the mysteries of the true Faith, could be read in school and convent3 without prejudice to the regular theological studies. In this way hidden meanings were found in Ovid, giving him, even with the Church, a certain unwarranted and illogical authority, which was to last through the Renascence. Thus the many gods of the ancients became demons, while the personae of the myths were compared with characters in the Bible or other sacred writings. The moral of each tale, on the other hand, was carefully explained.... Whether this method of finding hidden meanings was always sincere or not, is not evident in every case, and is unimportant to the study of the Renascence, but it made opposition to Ovid's growing popularity more and more ineffective.4 The moralizing of Ovid's works was not confined to the sphere of commen- taries, as we have already shown, nor was the spirit of moralizing confined to Ovid. And further, just as the great interest in Ovid was not without its fore- shadowings, so this Golden Age of Allegory, as we may call it, was not un- heralded. Once a vigorous, imaginative genre of literature is created, there must inevita- bly follow the interpretation of that literature. The first stages of that interpreta- tion are likely to be simple, to be the mere 'understanding' of-the hidden meaning. No less an authority than Saintsbury has pointed out that 'in the finer sorts of literature, at any rate, the apprehension of some sort of allegory, of some sort of double meaning, is almost a necessity.... But the ill repute of Allegory arises from the ease with which her aid is borrowed to foist religious, philosophical, and 1 Rand, op. cit., pp. 112-149. Cf. also Schevill, op. cit., p. 17, and chaps.

Allegory, and that reverse or seamy side of allegory, rationalistic interpretation, seem to have made their appearance very early in Greece." Therefore it is no surprise that Greek literary interpreta- tion began with Homer, and that that interpretation was allegorical.2 Of the various efforts expended upon Homer it is sufficient to mention by name that of Porphyrius, On the Cave of the Nymphs in the Odyssey [Od., xiii, 102-1112],3 which belongs, however, to a later period (third century A.D.). Hesiod4 and Pindar5 also suffered allegorical interpretations. There is much in the Old Testament which is written in allegorical style;6 much else that has been so interpreted, as we shall see later. Akin to the feeling of allegory proper is the creation of the abstract personifications and deifications common to the religion of both the Greeks and the Romans.7 Once you have established the existence in anthropomorphic form of Virtue, Vice, Abundance, Love, Freedom, etc., it is no difficult matter to see those qualities represented physically in forms other than their own, that is, allegorically. The later Christian 'interpreters' of both pagan and Christian liter- ature owed a debt in this, as in other fields, to their non-Christian predecessors.8 Early in Latin literature we have the dialogue of Luxury and Poverty in the prologue of Plautus' Trinummus. Some of Vergil's Eclogues, e.g., the first, are allegorical in so far as they represent the author in the guise of another; the picture of Fama in Aeneid, iv, 173-188, and of Luctus, Curae, Morbi, Fames, etc., at the mouth of Hell inAeneid vi, 273-281, are all akin to allegorical principle; and the famous fourth (the Messianic) eclogue was early subjected to 'interpreta- tion.'9 In recent years a modern student of Vergil'0 has developed the thesis, on 1 G.

An excellent example of his findings is the inter- pretation of the shield of Aeneas (viii, 626-731) which he says is the shield of Augustus, voted to him in January, 27 B.C. for valor, clemency, justice, and piety. Drew further likens the four circles of the shield to each of these qualities, docu- menting his statements in every case.' Livy is one of the many writers who tells us the story of the stomach and the remaining parts of the body, which symbolize the dependence in the organized state of every member upon the rest.2 It is with Philo Judaeus (b. 20/10 B.C.), 'the Hellenizing Jew of Alexandria,' that the first extensive and influential allegorical interpretation of the Old Testa- ment comes into being, in his Allegories of the Sacred Laws.3 About this same time the non-church work, the Shepherd of Hermas, was composed in allegorical style throughout. In the second century of our era Plutarch in his Moralia collected many examples of allegorical interpretations of royal statues and paraphernalia in general,4 and in the same century Apuleius wrote his Metamorphoses, including the beautiful allegory of Cupid and Psyche (iv, 28-vi, 24). And in the end of the fourth century the pagan poet Claudian has an allegorical picture in his poem, Epithalamium de Nuptiis Honorii Augusti, in which he describes the garden of Venus (60-85).5 Christian allegory begins as early as Paul [(I Cor., x), and espe- cially in his explanation of the meaning of Abraham's two sons (Gen., xxi) as the child of the flesh and of promise (Gal. iv, 22-31)]; but the first great allegory is that of Origen whose commentary on the Song of Songs as an epithalamium in which Christ is the bridgegroom and the church the bride systematized allegorical interpretation. From the two Alexandrians, Clement and Origen, the spirit of allegory spread in force to the western church, and for Latin civilization may be said to begin in extenso with Ambrose and Prudentius.6 But Tertullian is al- l Slightly earlier in date than Vergil are the poems of Catullus, whose famous laments for the sparrow (ii, iii) have been interpreted allegorically; i.e., it is maintained (e.g., by R.

There is no need here to point out the oriental influence, which for several centuries had affected the Greeks through their contacts with Egypt, in the symbolism of kingship; e.g., the identification of the ruler with the sun, or its qualities. For a convenient summary of this topic, see E. R. Goodenough, 'The Political Philosophy of Hellenistic Kingship,' Yale Classical Studies, I (1928), 55-102; on this topic in particular, pp. 76-86, carefully documented.

But Ambrose gave to it special importance because it enabled him to multiply ad infinitum edifying considerations in connection with texts. . . - Let us learn however to recognize in it the principle of an art, which at least in the order of architec.</page><page sequence="7">368 Ovid,and Allegory legorical in de Patientia, xv and de Pudicitia, v; and Cyprian used allegory in his de Montibus Sina et Sion; and Hilary of Poitiers (who had been exiled in the East for four years) in his commentary on the Psalms also employed the al- legorical method. St Augustine not only used that method freely himself, but expressly defended it in de Catechizandis Rudibus, x. However, some Christians objected to allegory, that is, rationalistic interpretations not only of pagan mythology but also of the Christian stories;' and some pagans opposed the inter- pretations of the Old Testament in this way.2 Prudentius in the fourth century has the honour of being the first Christian to use allegory as the setting of a whole composition. In the Psychomachia he depicts the battle of the Virtues and Vices in the field of the human soul. After a preface and an invocation to Christ, Fides struggles with Cultura Deorum, Pudicitia with Sodomita Libido, Patientia with Ira, Humilitas with Superbia, Sobrietas with Luxuria, Largitas with Avaritia, and Concordia with Discordia, the Virtue in each instance triumphing. To be the inventor of a genre, and one the popularity of which was to run riot in the succeeding centuries, was no mean achievement.3 Fertur Avaritia gremio praecincta capaci, quidquid Luxus edax pretiosum liquerat, unca corripuisse manu pulchra in ludibria vasto ore inhians aurique ligens fragmenta caduci inter harenarumicumbulos nec sufficit amplos implevisse sinus, iuvat infercire criminis turpe lucrum et gravidos furtis distendere fiscos, quos laeva celante tegit laterisque sinistri velat opermento; velox nam; dextra rapinas abradit spoiiisque unques exercet anenos.

This mystical conviction, so different from the proceeding usual in science, was to impose upon generations of writers, liturgists, and artists, the search to decipher the handiwork of God, wherein everything consisted of prefiguration, instruction, and mystic concordance suitable to engendering piety.

This allegorical spirit ex- pressed itself in art as well as in literature among the Christians, even as it had among the pagans, as e.g., the catacomb paintings testify.4 In the late eighth century Theodulphus, whom we have already mentioned, in his poem de Libris Quos Legere Solebam . . . explained Proteus as Truth, Her- cules as Virtue, Cacus as Wicked Theft, etc., and gave himself full freedom when he came to the attributes of Cupid: mens prava in pharetra, insidiae signantur in arcu, tela, puer, virus, fax tuus ardor, amor.5 In this same Carolingian Age there was compiled a dictionary of allegory en- titled Allegoriae in Universam Sacram Scripturam by Rhabanus Maurus the Abbot of Fulda who also indulged in such interpretations himself.' In the tenth century we may refer to the anonymous Ecbasis Captivi, which is really a bestiary, in which a monk describes himself and his wanderings away from his monastery under the guise of a calf which has strayed from its mother. After various dialogues, participated in by a wolf, fox, lion, parrot, nightingale, etc., the calf closes with these lines: 1 Cf. also that of Pseudo-Acronius ?4 on Horace, of Lactantius Placidus on Statius; see also Macrobius' Satirae, Martianus Capella's de Nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae. 2 5 vols (Paris, 1893-1899). It is his Commentary on Job. At a later date this was worked out in perfection in the great cathedrals, and in all their com- ponent parts: doors, towers, windows, carvings, etc. It is impossible to cite even a working start in the bibliography of such a subject, but the following will be suggestive: M.

Sit nomen sanctum Christi domini benedictum!' The next century brings us not only the outstanding figure of Hildebert, Bishop of Tours (1056-1133), among whose many works are found several ser- mons which abound in allegorical material, but also the metrical version of the Physiologus. This latter has also been attributed to Hildebert, but probably in- correctly. But Hildebert 'or one of his contemporaries' also wrote a work entitled Moralis Philosophia de Honesto et Utili, which expounds and defines certain words and ideas, supporting the discussion by copious quotations from the Bible and the ancient authors, among which is Ovid.2 And now we are back again on the threshold of the twelfth-thirteenth century Renaissance, where allegory had become 'the universal vehicle of pious expres- sion.... And indeed with almost any mediaeval man or woman, it might keep talking, as a way of speech, obtrusively, conventionally, ad nauseam. For indeed in treatise after treatise even of the better men, allegory seems on the one hand to become very foolish and perverse, banal, intolerably talking on and on beyond the point; or again we sense its mechanism, hear the creaking of its jaws, while no living voice emerges.'3 From an early date selected passages had been culled out for their moral teaching from both the prose writers and the poets starting with Saint Augustine, Isidore of Seville, Theodulphus of Orleans, and many others.4 This practice was the genesis of the well-known florilegia, or 'golden treasuries' of ancient senten- tiae, many of them with a moral turn. Incipiunt flores auctorum Bona priscorum proverbia philosophorum Quae quia nostrorum sunt edificatio morum Et quia delicie sunt omnia philosophie Tam sunt scribenda memori quam corde tenenda Esset enim magnum cunctis ea perdere dampnum.5 1 Lines 1921-1223.

Quibus expletis ad orthodoxos metrorum dumtaxat scriptores manum misi, et licet in his nichil ab edificatione sit vacuum, quedam tamen familiarius moralitati servientia excerpere presumpsi.2 This collection is arranged in fourteen books, of which the first five are devoted entirely to Ovid.3 The following subject headings of the first book will indicate the nature of the selections: (1) De summa dei potentia et voluntatis eius efficacia, (2) ut creatura omnia creatori subiaceat . . . (15) de eo quod pietas et iusticia cum ceteris virtutibus terras reliquit . . . (31) de mutabilitate rerum temporalium . . . (37) de morte.4 In the same-twelfth century Petrus Compostelanus wrote his De Consolatione Rationis in which, when the author is beset by the worldly temptations, the Virtues appear to save him; then come the Vices. Reason is the general arbiter. This dialogue, in two books, is freely participated in by the author himself.5 Scholia and glosses to Ovid were not infrequent in the manuscripts of this century.6 Wattenbach brings to us in the interesting manuscript (saec. xii) al- libri, moderni quadam gaudentes brevitate tria principaliter inquirenda statuere id est materiam, intentionem et cui parti philosophiae supponatur.... Quidam philosophi fuerunt qui mundum de nichilo deum fecisse crediderunt. Quidam vere alii ex athomis et inanitate, quae duo semper fuerunt, dicunt deum mundum fecisse. Alii autem philosophi, sicut ovidius et consimiles, tria esse semper dixe- runt, scilicet deum et IIII elementa insimul commixta et formas omnium rerum in mente dei existen- tes id est ideas hoc est differentias, sicut rationalitatem etcaliditatem et frigiditatem etcetera, perquae deus ipse res futuras constiturus erat. Hii autem omnes philosophi tres personas esse dicebant, scilicet patrem et filium id est togaton et noun et spiritum sanctum id est minorem patre et filio et in hoc erraverunt.... Intentio maxime delectare et delectando tamen mores instruere, quia confer ovidius, quia, cum fabulae in aliis libris tangebantur, ignorabantur, donec iste ovidius enodavit etenucleavit.' As example, we may cite the scholium to vi. 178: 'Cadmus fecit thebas, amphion vere adauxit et dicitur etiam movisse cum suis fidibus lapides ad muros faciendos, sed secundum rei veritatem [the italics are mine] non fuit aliud nisi quia amphion fuit homo sapiens et docuit rudes homines facere civitatem. Civitas enim est collectio hominum ad iure vivendum.' This last is based on Cic., de Re Pub., vi, 13, as Meiser points out. I 'Zur Geschichte der classischen Studien im Mittelalter,' Zts. f. ost.

No attempt is</page><page sequence="11">372 Ovid and Allegory ready mentioned, a collection of 'moral' writings including Medulla Gratiani de matrimonio, the de Quatuor Virtutibus ascribed to Seneca, some verses on philos- ophy, and that which interests us most, an 'explained' selection of the Metamor- phoses, for the use of nuns. The love stories of the gods 'are not without reason unsuited for the perusal of nuns." The stories impute wicked acts to the gods but the gods could never be so naughty. One must understand the hidden mean- ing. The goddesses are interpreted as the nuns, the gods, as the clergy, and the marriages of the gods, the common meeting of the nuns and monks. Here is an example illustrating that background: quid culpare soles, quod amat nunc carnea proles, et mortale genus quid ob hoc culpare solemus? vos notat et clerum tam mystica fabula rerum; abbatissarum genus et grex omnis earum sunt Pallas plane, tria virginis ora Dianae, Juno, Venus, Vesta, Thetis; observantia vestra est expressa satis cultu tantae deitatis. vos notat istarum genus et gens sacra dearum: nos ratione pari divum deitate notari credimus, et cleri typus illa videtur haberi inclita magnorum series memorata deorum nos qui virtutis opus, ardua vota salutis, et canonum scita sectamur celibe vita, cum deliremus, ea numina significamus. militat in nobis hic sepius ardor amoris, nos etiam superat, in nobis sepe triumphat. cum rapit in peius nos ardor et impetus eius, virtus, magiestas, gradus altus honoris, honestas, miliciam Veneris et castra secuntur Amoris.2 At this point we should mention the Integumenta on the Metamorphoses by John of Garland, Professor of Grammar at the University of Paris.3 This com- mentary was written in 260 distichs; twelve manuscripts are known.4 Frequent made in our discussion to deal with such works; for a convenient statement of the situation, and a good bibliography, see W.

To this century also belongs the prose commentary of Arnulf of Orleans on the Metamorphoses, just edited for the first time: F. Ghisalberti, 'Arnolfo d'Or- leans: Un cultore di Ovidio nel sec. xII,' Memorie del R. Istituto Lombardo di Scienze e Lettere, C.

It would seem to have enjoyed considerable popularity and attained some importance in its own day. Professor Rand singles it out for comment in his little book: . . . Johannes reveals in his versified Integumenta the secrets concealed in the Metamor- phoses. A typical specimen of his ingenuity is his interpretation of the tale of Mars and Venus, detected in their amour by Vulcan. Vulcan is the Summer, Venus is the Spring; Vile Mars, the Fall, doth alien bounties bring. Whatever the appositeness of this glossing, 'the smartest scandal Heaven ever heard' [Ov., Met. iv, 189; Am. i, 9, 34] here becomes safe enough for any heaven.2 To this same century probably belongs that remarkable collection, the Gesta Romanorum,3 which may have started as a selection of 'moral' stories actually from Roman history, for use as texts in sermons.4 Whatever the nucleus, the col- lection grew, and the stories were moralized in the text itself. In fact, the moral came to be the important part,5 and the stories, now embracing incidents of Roman history (factual or fictional),6 mediaeval history,7 or mediaeval romance,8 were of secondary importance. In the latest period the condition reverses itself, and the stories are told for their own interest.9 OF MERCY The Emperor Titus made a law, that whosoever provided not for his parents should be condemned to death. It happened that there were two brethren, descended from the same father. One of them had a son, who discovered his uncle in the greatest indigence; and immediately, in compliance with the law, but in opposition to the will of his father, administered to his wants. Thereupon the father expelled him from his house. Not- 1 Ghisalberti, op. cit., pp. 9-12 discusses many such texts. In a fifteenth-century manuscript of the Ambrosian Library (D 76 Inf A 2) on if. 33r-70r I have found an anonymous essay, partly in verse and partly in prose, which supplies another moral interpretation of Ovid, arranged in the order of the books. On fol. 38v sub fin. are quoted lines 181-182 of the Integumenta followed by two others expanding the thought. On fol. 68r the two lines on Pythagoras, factus pitagoras euforbius dicitur esse nam fuit ambobus unica secta viris, are not dissimilar to lines 501-504 of the Integumenta in content; and on fol. 69v the lines on Julius Caesar and Christ, julius est sidus quem propter signibus actis predictus est mondo solus in orbe nitens stella divina fuit ortus prenuntia christi quam puta augusti caesaris esse iubar illa prophetavit regem per secula regum qui splendore suo preterit omne iubar sordibus obscuro laturum lumina mondo atque lavaturum crimen adacis ade, are essentially the same in content as lines 511-520 of the Integumenta. 2 Rand, op. cit., pp. 134-135. Dante also considered that the great work of Ovid needed an allegori- cal interpretation, as is clear from the Convivio ii, 1; Iv, 25, 27, 28. 3 H.

By and by, the uncle became rich and the father indigent. Now, when the son beheld the altered circumstances of his parent, he liberally supported him also, to the great indigna- tion of his uncle, who drove him from his house and said, 'Formerly, when I was poor, thou gavest me support, in opposition to thy father; for which I constituted thee my heir, in the place of a son. But an ungrateful son ought not to obtain an inheritance; and rather than such, we should adopt a stranger. Therefore, since thou hast been ungrateful to thy father in maintaining me contrary to his command, thou shalt never possess my inheri- tance.' The son thus answered his uncle: 'No one can be punished for executing what the law commands and compels. Now, the law of nature obliges children to assist their parents in necessity, and especially to honour them; therefore, I cannot justly be deprived of the inheritance.' APPLICATION My beloved, the two brothers are the Son of God and the world, which both proceed from one heavenly Father. The first, begotten; the second, created. Between them, from the beginning, discord arose, and continues to this day; so that he who is the friend of one is an enemy to the other. According to St. James iv: 'Whosoever would become the friend of this world shall be accounted an enemy to God.' The only son is every Christian, who is the progeny of Christ because he is descended from Him by faith. Therefore, we should not feed fat the world with pride, avarice, and other vices, if we would be the children of God. And our desires are contrary, too surely we shall be excluded from the family of Christ, and lose our heavenly inheritance. If we maintain and cherish Christ by works of love and piety, the world indeed will abhor us - but better is it to be at enmity with the world than forego an inheritance in heaven.' By far the longest example of allegorical interpretation is the French transla- tion, made in the thirteenth century, known as les Metamorphoses Moralise'es. This work, in some seventy thousand verses, was long attributed to an unknown Chretien Leguais, but has been connected through the efforts of its editor, de Boer, with the name of Chretien de Troyes. An idea of its method may be seen from the following selection, taken from the text of de Boer, who has now com- pleted his work, in three volumes, as far as Book IX.2 Se l'escripture ne me ment, Tout est pour nostre enseignement Quandu'il a es livres escript, Soient bon ou mal li escript.

Side by side with the more or less systematic treatment of this subject (i.e., pagan- christian interpretation), which finds its classical expression in Dante, is a more childlike style of allegorizing that asks no questions and is troubled by no anachronisms. It finds an express reference to the Christian clergy in Ovid just as natural as it would be in Exodus, or, for the matter of fact, in Augustine or Gregory. And it is to this latter category that our Ovidian treatise, assigned to Del Virgilio, belongs . . . Del Virgilio's treatise (if it is really his) may possibly be taken as a specimen of the academical as distinct from the literary treatment of this subject in the 14th century. The method is to take the narratives of the Metamorphose8 seriatim, to 'moralize' them after the fashion of the crudest con- ceivable rationalism, and then to sum up the result in a few doggerel verses.5 The handling of the Prometheus story is typical. 1 I, 1-19. 2 J. 2133-2159. Sudre, op. cit., pp. 93-115 gives frequent quotations. 3 Wicksteed and Gardner, op. cit., p. 314. 4Ibid., p. 314. 5 Ibid., op. cit., p. 315.</page><page sequence="15">376 Ovid and Allegory Secunda transmutatio est terre in hominem, qui vel creatus fuit divino semine, ve creatus fuit ex terra a prometheo. Prima sic est descripta quod dicatur homo divino semine cretus communis ratio vult hominique deo. Sed per prometheum intellige unum phylosophum qui phylosophatus est hominem factum esse ex terra et inspiratum esse anima de celis orta. Unde dictum est prometheus hominem limo plasmasse refertur nam primum dixit est homo factus humo; de rota solis animam traxisse putatur de celis ortam phylosophatus eam. Et nota quod prometheus sic interpretatur, pro idest provisio, me idest mentis, theus idest divine, unde prometheus idest provisio divine mentis. Unde dictum est est quoque divine mentis provisio dictus qua fuit in verbo vivificatus homo.' The other interpretations are in the same vein, and are often ingenious, if not too edifying.2 To this same century belong the Moralia super Ovidii Metamorphoses of Robert Holkot;3 and the Reductorium Morale, in sixteen books, of Petrus Ber- chorius (Berquire).4 Part of the prologue will give an indication of his method. A veritate quidam auditum avertent, ad fabulas autem convertentur, dicit plantator et rigator christiane fidei Paulus . . . Congruum mihi visum est post moralizationem proprie- tatem rerum, postquam jam ad mores reducendas, nature opera eciam ad moralizandum fabulas poetarum materiam ponere.

Cum antiqui plures deos posuerunt et quasdam rerum virtutes deos crediderunt et appellaverunt ... ad quarum societatem gloriosam nos perducat ille Hercules summus, filius Dei Patris, natus de virgine Maria, qui cum Patre, etc.5 I Wicksteed and Gardner, op. cit., pp. 317-318. 2 Ibid., op. cit., p. 319; cf. also pp. 317-321. 3 Bartsch, op. cit., p. xliv; and Haase, De medii aevi studiis philologicis (Breslau, 1856), pp. 22-24, who takes his material from 'a certain MS. of his own of the 15th century.' An example of Holkot's work is the story of Vulcan, who is the fire which is produced in heaven by the clash of the clouds; he is said to be lame, because this fire is tortuose. Better is the story of Apollo who slew the Python; he signifies 'quosdam de virtutibus gloriantes vel in seculo vel in claustro nec considerantes propriam fragilitatem; tales volans deus humilare sagittis carnalia amoris volnerare permittit, ut sic suae carnis condicio cognoscatur, ne alios amplius contemnant. Sic fecit Christus de Petro,' etc. To this he adds another interpretation: Phoebus is the longing for mundane glory; Daphne is that glory. And a third version: Daphne as the laurel is the soul of a Christian, and Apollo pursuing her is the devil, who does not cease his pursuit until, by her prayers to Christ, she is saved by her metamorphosis. Io is the goods of the poor which are plundered by the worldly princes, signified by Jupiter; or - Io is a soul strayed from the faith, and not received by Juno, that is, the church. Other examples are of the same nature. 4 His moralization of Ovid is found in Bk. xv. Cf. Catalogue general des livres imprimgs de la Bibijo- th0que Nationale, xi, col. 1119-20 under Berquire for printed editions of this work. 6 This is taken from the Catalogue general des manuscrits de Bibliotheques publiques de France, xxxix (Reims ii, 1), p. 357.

The Heroides were also moralized, as Sedlmayer has shown at length,6 in a defence of amor licitus. Here is a typical explanation. Materia huius libri (sc. Heroidum) est amor, qui quidam dicitur esse triplex, scilicet castus, illicitus, et incestus. castus autem est ille, qui est inter virum et uxorem. illicitus est ille, qui est inter amasios, incestus est ille, qui est inter consanguineos. intentio est castum amorem commendare, illicitum refrenare et incestum condemnare. utilitas est magna. nam per hoc scimus castum amorem eligere, illicitum refutare et incestum penitus exstipare.7 We now come to the Renaissance, where, contrary to what we might expect, the traces of this style of interpretation seem to have persisted for a while at least. But it may be doubted whether the morals of these stories received much atten- tion; and the same may be said of the tales and romances that were adapted from Ovid. Cervantes tells us that we will find a moral significance to his stories. 'Heles dado el nombre de exemplares, y si bien lo miras, no hay ninguna de quien 'Ibid., p. 354. 2 Ibid., p. 358. 3 Ibid., pp. 354-355. 4 Bartsch, op. cit., p. xliv; and Serapaeum, xi (1850), p. 151. This manuscript also contains excerpts from the Metamorphloses, the Distichs of Cato, etc. 5 Cf. Paetow, op. cit., pp. 116-117, and n. 60; Bartsch, op. cit., p. xliv; Cf. the Epistulae Obscurorum Virorum (ed. F. G. Stokes), i, 28, where this commentary is ridiculed severely. 6 Sedlmayer, Prolegomena critica ad Heroides . . . , diss. (Vienna, 1881), pp. 96-102. 7 Sedlmayer, Wiener Studien, vi (1884), 145; Sandys, op. cit., i, 639 tells us that the Heroides were imitated by Baudri de Bourgueil.</page><page sequence="17">378 Ovid and Allegory no se pueda sacar un exemplo provechoso; y si no fuera por no alargar este sujeto, quiza te mostrara el sabroso y honesto fruto que se podria sacar, asi de todas juntas, como de cada una de por si.' But who reads him with that purpose? And Bustamente in the preface to his sixteenth century translation of the Metamor- phoses, 'adds naively that the prudent reader, endowed with clear judgment, will easily detect the moral of all these tales';' and a few years later Pedro Sanchez Viana justified his translation in the same way.2 But however many examples we may adduce of the continuation of the 'me- diaeval' method,3 it is certain that by this time it was on the wane, and Christian allegory and pagan mythology could no longer be glibly reconciled. Nevertheless, even in the face of the ridicule to which the prominent Rabelais subjected al- legory in the introduction to his Gargantua4 the method was still adhered to in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In the former, Nicholas Valois wrote his Le Grande Olympe 'in which he sets forth for the first time ... the true meaning of the stories of the Metamorphoses. Ovid's text is made a quarry for the alchem- ist's pick and shovel.... The fable of Deucalion and Pyrrha, for instance, be- tokens, like the twin peaks of Parnassus, the masculine and feminine elements Schevill, op. cit., p. 14; cf. pp. 152-173 for a discussion of his method and style. 2 Ibid., pp. 148-149. A typical example of his interpretative notes is that on Narcissus. 'La historia referida ... fue de los antiguos escripta, para edificacion nuestra, y darnos a entender, que el hombre libidinoso, impudente, y facinoroso, trae consigo, o muy cerca de si, el castigo de Dios, como el cuerpo anda accomuanado de su sombra, etc,' Schevill, op. cit., p. 152. a Schevill, op. cit., pp. 234-250 gives a handy reference to translations and interpretations of the various works of Ovid in Italy, France, Spain.

And in the seventeenth century2 we have this disquisition upon the story of Mars and Venus in Metamorphoses, iv, 139-167. The second sister relates the love of the Sunne; inflicted by Venus for his discovery of her adultery with Mars, which carries this Astrologicall sence: that those who are borne in the Conjunction of Mars and Venus are prone to inordinate affections. Mars sometimes de- scendeth beneath the Sun, and Venus for a part of the yeare ascendeth above him, as it were to meete with each other: whose conjunction may then be said to be discovered by the Sun, when he ceaseth to obscure them by the proximitie of his greater splendor. Vulcan bindes them in a net; that is, with too much fervor subdues their operations. For the starre of Mars is hot; and that of Venus moderate moist; and whereof generation con- sists: and therefore mutuall lovers: by Neptune unbound; in that water extinguisheth fire, which is Vulcan. This fable therefore was invented to expresse the sympathy that is necessary in nature.... But morally adulteries are taxed by this fable: which how potent soever the offenders, though with never so much art contrived, and secrecy concealed, are at length discovered by the eye of the Sun, and exposed to shame and dishonour.3 While the new learning was too accurate to allow the further continuance of such interpretations, the influence of Ovid continued in other fields,4 and the writing of allegory has continued by way of Swift's Tale of a Tub, Bunyan's Pil- grim's Progress, Cabell's Jurgen, and Marc Connelly's Green Pastures, to men- tion only a few titles, to our own year of writing.
