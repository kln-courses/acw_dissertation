I have provided some translations where terms are first mentioned but have in general left the original form when they are mentioned sub- sequently. When, however, as frequently happens, Robinet slips from mention to use, I give the term in translation, even if that means putting an English word in the capitals he normally reserves for terms that actually occur in the text. - P.C.] IVIethods inspired by computerized lexical statistics lead to multiple applications for the study of philosophical and lit- erary texts: diagrams of genetic influence, the appearance and disappearance of lexical forms, structural profiles, the flexi- bility of verbal clusters or the hardening of systematic syntag- mata, the construction of idiosyncratic terminologies or of word lists for individual authors, etc. Classical commentary has everything to gain by making use of these resources of a well-equipped history of philosophy. To establish a certain distance before having recourse to semantic interpretation</page><page sequence="2">518 SOCIAL RESEARCH makes the work under consideration less likely to be a vehicle for the commentator's personality, and if this distance is filled up with an examination of the play of linguistic forms it becomes a creative source of novelty. To facilitate such studies we have put out several different kinds of work in various European publications: elementary manuals (like the volumes in the collection "Philosophie et Informatique" at Vrin), weighty treatises (like the electronic examination of Spinoza's Ethics at CETEDOC in Louvain with P. Tombeur), and articles in which for the last ten years we have been refining the direction of research, not in the well- known domain of computerized documentation, but in that of the more delicate area of the fundamental analysis of texts; in this way the main lines of organization of "philosophical lexicography" have gradually been brought to light. The ob- ject of this article is to give some examples of this work. We will take as a point of reference the computer project "VICAIRE 76" which examined the lexicography of the fa- mous text from Rousseau's Emile: "La profession de foi du Vicaire Savoyard." The references given in the present article are directed either to the edition we published in "Philosophie et Informatique"1 or to other editions as indicated. '"VICAIRE 76": J. -J. Rousseau, Profession de foi du Vicaire Savoyard, Tableau al- phabétique desforras lexicales, tableau frequentiel, concordances, co-occurrences (Paris: Vrin, 1978). Three articles have recently appeared which form an ensemble from which the material presented here has been drawn: "Lexicographie philosophique de nature dans la Profession . . .," Études sur le XVIIIeme siècle (University of Brussels), no. 5 (1978): 23-42; "Lexicographie philosophique d'oRDRE de la nature dans la Profes- sion . . .," Revue internationale de philosophie, no. 124-5 (1978): 238-259; "Lexicog- raphie philosophique et paléographie à propos d'oRDRE dans la Profession . . .," Annali, studi filosofici (Oriental Institute, Naples), 1 (1978): 39-76. (In both text and notes, this article refers to two principal versions of Rousseau's "Profession de foi du Vicaire Savoyard," itself the middle section of Book IV of Emile: the 1978 Vrin edition cited at the beginning of this footnote and the Plèiade edition [J.-J. Rousseau, Oeuvres completes, edited by Bernard Gagnebin and Marcel Raymond, 4 vols. (Paris: NRF/Gallimard, 1959-69), 4: 565-635]. The former is cited as "V" and the latter as "PI." When the two references are given at the same time, the Vrin usually comes first with a page number and a line number, the Pléiade second with a single number. Sometimes the prefixes "V" or "PI" are omitted, and sometimes only one source is cited - but as the page numbers cover different ranges it is possible to tell which is meant by inspection. - P.C.)</page><page sequence="3">VICAIRE SAVOYARD 519 Every methodical approach of this kind depends on the creation of a separation which provokes comparative remarks. These separations underline differences which compel sup- plementary reflections in posing questions which are new be- cause they arise from the consideration of lexical profiles established by nonhermeneutic procedures. To create these separations the natural or artificial divisions of the text identify zones of investigation whose dissimilarities stand out instead of being at once brought together by sys- tematizing reflections. For the "Profession" a natural division is offered us by Rousseau himself in his commentaries.2 It is furthermore possible to locate a rhetorical division which is brought to light by a simple commentary: connaître, agir, croire (know, act, believe), are the key words of the three parts of the "Profession." Lexical examination abundantly confirms what is after all not merely a simple hypothesis. Lexicographical Placement of ordre (Order) and nature (Nature) Placement of ordre in the "Profession." The list of occurrences of the family ordre shows that its use is of uniformly high den- 2 In his Lettre à de Beaumont (Pléiade, p. 996), Rousseau makes this commentary on himself: "the first part [of the "Profession"] which is the longest, the most important, the fullest of new and striking truths, destined to combat modern materialism, to establish the existence of God and natural religion. . . . The second, much shorter, less regular, less profound, proposes doubts and difficulties about revelations in general. . . ." The hinge between the two parts is at the level of the passage: "The Good Priest had spoken vehemently. . . ." The Vicar forthwith announces: "I will finish telling you what I think ... I have said nothing to you yet . . ." (PI. 606; V. 30, 1. 41). Rousseau confirms with an interesting supplement the Second of the Lettres écrites de la montagne (PI. 3: 721): "Nearly all the profession of faith in Julie is affirmative, all the first part of that of the Vicar is affirmative, half the second part is still affirmative. ..." In addition, the first part, according to Rousseau, contains a clear rhetorical subdivision. It occurs at the moment when the Vicar inflects his discourse: "After thus having from the impression of sensible objects and interior sentiment . . . deduced the main truths it is important for me to know, it remains to me to inquire what maxims I must draw from them for my behavior . . ." (PI. 594; V. 22, I. 10). Which yields the following table: Division to de Beaumont Division of Vicar 1. Beginning to PI. 606, V. 30 1. Beginning to PI. 594, V. 22. 2.

These occurrences are grouped in several clus- ters which indicate a careful use of the item at the places in question (Table 1). Let us add to this table 4 occurrences of désordre (disorder) in part 1 (3) and part 2 (1), 1 of ex- traordinaire (extraordinary) in part 3, and 1 of subordon- née (subordinated) in part 1. These uses of ordre do not give rise, as in the case of Malebranche, to a graphic complexity involving the use of upper case, of italics, of initial capitals, and recourse to the Latin ordo. In concordances and tables of co-occurrence for Male- branche, the presence of heavy syntagmata, grouping a certain number of redundant qualifications around the word ordre, is immediately apparent. If in the "Profession," as our analysis will show, one finds a certain number of ordre de ... among which is ordre de la nature, one observes only associations with following adjectives, which occur rarely: ordre général (general order) (2), ordre surnaturel (supernatural order) (2). To facilitate lexicographical reference we use several sorts of table of concordance. Diapositional concordances are fre- quently used: they make possible the consecutive location of the occurrences of a term. Diacritical concordances have the advantage of showing the molar and molecular forms of dis- course in setting more or less weighty syntagmata in relief. For example, ordre may be situated at the center with the 25 preceding and following alphabetic signs to its left and right. Table 1.

Let us extract from the general table of frequencies the results for substantives (Table 2). Then follow the terms raison(s) (reason(s)) (56 + 16), esprit(s) (spirit(s) or mind(s)) (48 4- 3), corps (body) (47), coeur(s) (heart(s)) (45 + 7), ordre (41), mouvement(s) (movement(s)) (38 + 8), etc. A general observation imposes itself: the dominant ter- minology of the "Profession" makes of it a work fully comparable to other "metaphysical" discourses of the classical period, in contrast to the results obtained on Rousseau's "literary" texts. In fact, we no longer depend on classical encyclopedic determinations which pigeonhole works according to their different spe- cialties: we argue inductively from their lexicographical con- tent to the necessity of their inclusion in classes which are self-descriptive. A host of detailed observations can immediately be made in consequence: the co-presence of dieu (God) and of homme(s) (man, men) at the top of the table as in other metaphysical discourses, the high frequency of coeur (where only Pascal can compare with the 124 occurrences in the Pensées, which place this term in the same order of frequency), the orienta- tion of a discourse which is organized around abstract sub- stantives which must then be given a content. But a study of lexical content, with the authors' overelab- oration and overuse of these metaphysical terms, only occasionally - even for Spinoza's "definitions" - works in terms of monosemic stability. What have classically been called "slip- pages of meaning" introduce changes of phase with respect to referential semantics, lead to substitutions (vicariances), and</page><page sequence="6">522 SOCIAL RESEARCH sometimes compel an author to allow a definition opposite to one he has adopted elsewhere. Finally, discrimination between metaphysical collective nouns, which describe the ontological generality of things, provokes tension between the semantic zones covered by the terms used: in particular we shall see whether the zones occupied by tout (all, or whole), monde (world), univers and nature are different, and under what conditions. Example of the Analysis of Concepts: Metaphysical Collective Nouns The breaking-out of occurrences shows that a certain number of terms of very great generality are dispersed through the work according to a precise law of dominant copresence (Table 3). (a) Apart from terre (Earth), which has the oppo- site profile, all the abstract collective nouns are found prefer- entially or exclusively in part 1 of our division: nature is distinct in that it is still strongly present in part 2. The ques- tion, to which we shall respond, is to know why this should be the case, (b) If we can say, in virtue of the dominant frequen- cies of the vocabulary of the "Profession," that it is a metaphysical treatise of the classical age, this is even more emphatically true of our part 1, sharply different from the others according to this table. The question will be to know what it is, in connection with nature, that carves out this difference from the other metaphysical collective nouns. 1. We have explored the case of être- (Being) (substantive) separately: one sees its very strong presence in 1: but, as in the case of nature, it is no longer a question of this vector of sense in 2 and 3.3 3 We shall examine être elsewhere. The metaphysical work is worth the trouble because "according to me the distinctive faculty of active or intelligent being is to be able to give a sense to this word is (est)" (6.04; 71). Framed by two occurrences that bear on sa nature and on la nature.</page><page sequence="7">VICAIRE SAVOYARD 523 Table 3.

We have also isolated tout- (substantive) from adjectival or adverbial tout. The functioning of this collective noun brings to light: (a) a vigorous oppositional structure between tout- and partie (part) in the three rhetorical zones of the discourse, a corollary of the presence of êtres, nominal plural, in 1. (b) An overqualification by grand tout (Great Whole) (03.41, 12.12), which creates a rupture in the knowability of tout "whose limits escape us," of which "one cannot know what it is in itself, nor what we are in relation to it," with respect to which it is "certain" that "we who are parts in no way feel ourselves in the whole" (08.20). This constitutes a profound rupture in the fundamental axiom of classical knowledge, which holds that, if the whole is greater than the part, the part can be greater than the whole (37.02, etc.). We observe the same transition to the superlative with 4 grand Être- (Great Being) and 1 être-des-êtres (Being of Beings). (c) The tout is at once composed of the juxtaposition of parts and the source of the link that ensures the unity of the ensem- ble; by ordre, tout is linked to partie (21.39, 11.46, 12.34, 12.36). The technological analogy of the watch illustrates this internal finality according to which each component part is made for the others (11.02). We are at once included and inclusive, and, from the simple lexical or propositional point of view, one notices the contradiction in the human situation: a small part in the great whole, human intelligence is how- ever the only one to have a view over the whole (13.20); and</page><page sequence="8">524 SOCIAL RESEARCH the fact that the whole should be one announces, just as human intelligence does, a unique intelligence (12.34). (e) This logical distribution permits the constitution of a relative whole which takes the name universe: the visible universe is scattered and dead matter, which has "nothing in its whole of the unity ... of an animated body." The whole collectively considered would include two subdomains: the whole of the visible and material universe, the whole of the global uni- verse, including the human spirit which does not feel itself to be in the partial and inanimate whole, (f) The vocabulary of the Profession (which includes a high frequency of tout as adjective and adverb (113) and of toutes (85)) proves that the tendency of the discourse is powerfully oriented toward an expression of the categorial ensemble at the highest level. But in itself tout- or grand tout- remains a positive but logically indeterminate expression which does not imply as such any sensi- ble or emotive rhetoric, tout- does not provoke in the discourse of the Vicar the emotional reactions that we shall observe in the case of nature. 3. The 33 occurrences of monde also include a strong grouping in Part 1. The differentiation between part and whole gives rise to a remarkable metaphysical refinment. (a) It is between elements and compound that the internal lexical structure of the world is deployed. The world is a com- pound of the mass of forces, of atoms, inanimate and animate world, but it is designated as forming part of the creation along with matter, bodies, spirits (21.13). (b) The ensemble of determinations afferent to it illustrates a direction of sense in which matter plays a considerable role. The world is not a great animal that moves of itself: it depends on "scattered and dead" matter (08.24). It does not contain in itself the cause of its movement, any more than that of its creation, (c) If it has syntagmatic affinities with system (04.35, 08.36, 16.45, 17.40), with order (10.42, 12.21, 14.18, 20.50), it is not itself at the origin of the comparison of its parts among themselves that</page><page sequence="9">VICAIRE SAVOYARD 525 procures for it its end, which governs and rules it. In speaking of the mechanism of the world, the Vicar explains it by means of physical laws, but maintains the inexplicability of physical laws by means of the world, (d) An effort of dif- ferentiation between world and universe situates the world in a constantly pejorative position: the cause of its movements is foreign to it, whereas the universe answers to regulated movements and constant laws, which are not mechanical (08.24), if there is a system of the world, there is a progress (marche) of the universe (08.36), if there is a mechanism of the world, there is a harmony of the universe (10.30). The same observation applies to the propositional co-occurrences with nature: our nature has an active principle in face of this "imaginary world," in face of consciousness and primitive, enlightenment; the maxims of the world disturb the in- stitution of nature, world converging in this sense with noise (bruit), which smothers the voice of conscience (02.05, 27.05). We touch here the worldly or Pascalian sense of world. Although there is an intellectual world, the term is not redeemed by this since it is not through the understanding that true knowledge comes to man. (e) Finally, in a more indirect way, world (monde) signifies earth (terre), another term frequently used (30 occurrences): but we have here a sharp lexical differentiation, because it is the occurrences in the third part that furnish this vector of sense: the nations of the world, a corner of the world, the countries of the world, another world (the opposition America-Europe), etc. Specifi- cally all these usages denote conflicts which take place on earth between men, their societies, and their ambitions. In conclu- sion, world is positive only in respect to its elementary com- position, if that, because the latter, even if Nieuventit's book were "as big as the world," would prove nothing by the accumulation of mere "marvels of nature" (11.43). 4. universe helps to smooth out a vector of sense situated in a critical position (position de valeur) in relation to the partial,</page><page sequence="10">526 SOCIAL RESEARCH elementary and contradictory realities of world. Here again there is a very marked frequency of the item in the first part, (a) Certainly its whole is not the whole (08.17-08.20): this particular whole of the visible universe is composed of scat- tered and dead matter, not to be compared to animated bodies, and still less to thinking beings which do not feel themselves to be in the whole. This universe however is in movement, subject to constant physical laws and without lib- erty or even spontaneity; we have said along these lines that it was nothing but a world (08.24). (b) The differentiating structures of world introduce, in face of the materiality of bodies and of the world, an "existence of the universe," an "immensity," a complex material, solid or fluid, (c) It appears that the essential for universe is to bring in the consideration of laws and of order, of harmony in face of chaos, (d) No more than for the world, this order of the universe (11.10), 12.03, 30.04) cannot derive from the universe itself: it goes back to a supreme intelligence (11.10), to a being active through itself (12.37), to god (12.37). (e) As we were able to distinguish universe from world, the terms of the first article of the "Profession" allow us to distinguish universe from nature: "a will moves the universe and animates nature." The difference thus established leaves universe in the field of inanimate physical mechanisms, opening up to nature the field of animated ends, (f) And spiritual ends, for in spite of its immensity, "the whole universe is not great enough" for the nature of the human spirit (15.31; 585). These collective terms, in conjunction with their philosoph- ical analysis, clearly indicate a line of research which, pushing to its maximum the consideration of elements in the juxtaposition of a collection, destroys at once its observed value by substituting for it the optimum of the liaison internal to innumerable juxtapositions, transforming each numerical observation into a question of order. In this way the modes of combination of the end of the seventeenth century profoundly influence the Vicar.</page><page sequence="11">VICAIRE SAVOYARD 527 Example of Syntagmatic Analysis: ordre de la nature Is it possible to find distinctions similar to those which char- acterize the different metaphysical collective nouns between ordre de la nature and other genitives of ordre? It is neces- sary first to eliminate a terminology which is very frequent in Malebranche's philosophy, which concerns the order of per- fections, whether these are created or uncreated: there is nothing like this in the Vicar's sayings, Rousseau not having elevated his metaphysical reflection to this level. Furthermore, it is useless to look there for the distinction between relations OF PERFECTION and RELATIONS OF MAGNITUDE, which allow Malebranche to describe the field of geometrizable truth, bearing on a single perfection, and the field of metaphysical1 reality, which includes perfections of different natures and essences. With respect to these two master elements of a metaphysical analysis like that of Malebranche, Rousseau falls short of the indispensable philosophical setting (mise en place). He holds to a unified use of the term rapport (relation), which is found directly in compound phraseology, in saying that order includes all kinds of ordered relations (11.08). What first of all are the metaphysical collective nouns that indicate the field of these relations? 1. ordre des Êtres (order of beings) (13.45), a substantive noun,4 is strongly present in part 1 for a metaphysical de- scription of existing things. This plural collective noun intends here the most indeterminate features in the individuation of each being, the existence-essence of its being in the world. In general, these beings are composed of some material (matter, 4 être is singled out in these investigations as a noun in the form être-, which allows the separate gathering of substantive uses in distinguishing them from the infinitive use of the verb. Of the 58 occurrences of être-, 41 are in part 1 and 4 in part 2. Of the 18 occurrences of êtres, 17 are in part 1, which is devoted to multiplicity. The same tendency is found for tout-, in its nominal form, which out of 16 occurrences has 11 in the metaphysical essay that part 1 constitutes.</page><page sequence="12">528 SOCIAL RESEARCH spirit), but above all they are in relation one with another, in such a way as to admit as a principal characteristic their rank, their place, in this ensemble, or in this hierarchy of beings which counterbalances being. In this very general way Rous- seau mentions also the order of things (13.12). At the level of the highest abstract determination of metaphysics, order functions effectively as a more interesting component of indi- viduation than the material of which things are made. 2. There are no occurrences of ordre du tout (order of the whole), but its expression is approached when the Vicar states that nothing is ordered in the same system that does not contribute to the conservation of the whole in the estab- lished order (12.35): similarly when it is written that God made everything (tout), ordered everything (21.17). If the wicked orders everything in relation to himself, the good orders himself in relation to the whole (tout) (28.11; 602). The superqualification great being or great whole points to the immensity of the ensemble of being but at the same time to its instrinsic orderedness. We should recall that these terms, unlike nature, bring with them no sensible or emotive metaphorical rhetoric. 3. The role of order of the world (10.42) is taken over by that order which exists in the system of the world (17.40), which points to the multitude of parts and the comparisons that link them, their conjuncture, their concord, their har- mony, etc. world indicates a juxtapositional rather than an integrated system, and the value of the order that applies to it lies more in a consideration of the rank and the place of things than of the essence of order. 4. order of the universe, while replacing world, excludes all explanation in terms of ends, refers to a true system (10.45, 30.04) in radical opposition to the chaos of the uni- verse (10.27). More than is the case with world, universe implies an opening toward its author who makes himself felt in it through this order (30.04), a sensible order that de- clares a supreme intelligence (11.10).</page><page sequence="13">VICAIRE SAVOYARD 529 5. order of nature is less sharply differentiable from other collective metaphysical nouns, in this syntagmatic form, than nature is. If a consideration of material enters into it, it is essentially the connection internal to the ensemble of parts that this ensemble designates, transforming all numerical ob- servations into an appeal to relations, (a) The table of co- occurrences of order and the concordances indicate 4 cases of nature in the immediate neighborhood of order: 3 binary syntagmata order of nature, 1 ternary syntagma unaltera- ble order of nature (ordre inaltérable de la nature) (35.20), with an alternative well-ordered nature (01.27, 14.12) and 1 order observable in the tableau of nature, composed of facts (35.45). (b) A powerful antithesis sets order of nature over against the laws of men which break with the state of nature, the institution of innocence (01.25). (c) A second antithesis sets this order of nature over against purported facts alleged to be beyond order, under the appellation of prodigies, miracles, prophecies, exceptions, etc. (especially in part 3: 34.45, 35.20, 38.21). (d) This order of nature is what shows supreme intelligence, the supreme being, to its best advantage (25.20). We find also in the syntagma what counts as characteristic of nature in the metaphorical rhetoric of the Vicar: the relation to a language, this voice, which permits, which prescribes, and which we know by an experience of feeling (01.25). This order of nature is considered as essential to all that is: it does not juxtapose, it integrates, it appeals to a vocabulary which indicates its essence by recalling the combinatorial ter- minology of the authors consulted. So that this order of nature is what acquaints us best with the nature of order.5 5 The article entitled "Lexicographie philosophique cTordre de la nature . . ." studies the nature of order and clarifies the conceptual analysis of order in relation to law, especially natural law, examines the role of order, the knowledge of order, its relation to disorder and its situation in the face of natural religion. This examina- tion is continued with the same lexicographical weapons in the Revue internationale de philosophie, pp. 245-259.</page><page sequence="14">530 SOCIAL RESEARCH The lexicographical analysis of the term nature brings to light a profound cleavage between its articulation by sa (its), notre (our), or la (the). 34 out of the 69 occurrences of nature take only the article and refuse all complementary designation, nature (la nature) is hence considered in these cases as an absolute, not as something relative, as an existence, not as an essence, as a totality and a unity, not as a collection or a linking. In the "Profession" two striking profiles have to do with nature considered as an existential totality, (a) The examina- tion of ORDRE DE LA NATURE shows that NATURE ¡S nothing other than an order which it derives from itself or which its author placed in it and conserves in it: which radically rejects any conception of nature resting on forces, substances, or secondary causes, physical or spiritual, which might be en- dowed with their own spontaneity. I examine this profile of the "Profession" in the article just referred to in a footnote, (b) The examination of co-occurrences of nature reveals a lexical clustering relative to language whose examination we shall pur- sue. We have regrouped this examination around livre de la nature (book of nature) and we have distributed all the lexical profiles which involve the metaphor of language; the global effect of these remarks is to establish in this case, as for ordre de la nature, the originality of the "Profession" in its use of nature: none of the collective nouns mentioned above contains order by itself, and more definitely still none of them speaks, or says, or cries anything to the soul. We have in this two charac- teristics of Rousseau's vocabulary as an author. In this direction the passage of meaning gives up all inten- tion of generic differentiation, specific or individualizing, to concentrate itself on a globalizing intention, to the extent that nature ends by playing the role of being, understanding by this just as much the being of beings, the great being, as metaphysical being of the highest generality. It is no longer a question of the essence of ... but of metaphysical being, of which it is reasonable to ask what its nature is, not its particu- lar nature but as belonging to every particular nature; if one</page><page sequence="15">VICAIRE SAVOYARD 531 may so put it, in this direction, the nature of nature is to be nature itself, natura naturans, no longer natura naturata. It follows from the study of metaphysical collective nouns that this vector of sense has to do with the objectification of the triple composition of the generic concrete: a material, an order, a dynamism. At the same time nature goes beyond the other particularizing collective nouns in that it evokes a spon- taneous source of creation and conservation. Above all, at the level of the second part that we distinguished rhetorically and hypothetical^ to effect the operation "VICAIRE 76," we ob- serve the emergence and the culmination of the metamorphosis of the process of globalizing objectification; where nature supports comparison with, if not substitutability for, the other metaphysical collective nouns, in a process of subjectification, which brings nature into linguistic communication with human consciousness, thus bringing about a process of accentuated personifi- cation. 6 Example of Search for and Analysis of a Metaphor: LIVRE DE LA NATURE If nature differentiates itself in part 1 by the foregoing characteristics, notably by a marked employment as the desig- nation of an essence, no occurrence of it traces its outline in anthropomorphic terms. However, from the beginning of part 2, nature enters into a metaphorical field strongly oriented as a function of human language, to arrive in part 3 at the syntagma of book of nature. 6 The article on "Lexicographie de nature . . ." which appeared in Études sur le XVIHeme siede, includes on pp. 31-36 the analysis of "Nature and Essence" which gathers together the complementary objects of the noun: nature de. ... We remark there that all cases of nature de ... remain purely descriptive and do not at all touch substantial essence, since our knowledge fails in the attempt to define the cause and the substance proper to each kind of being. The place of man in nature is outlined there in the final scale of beings established by Rousseau. At bottom it is order that gives to nature its proper essence.</page><page sequence="16">532 SOCIAL RESEARCH Let us begin with this extreme contrast, which announces the invocation of Socrates and Jesus. Concentrating his faith into its "primitive notions," the Vicar denounces any concep- tion of Wisdom as Science: "I have never been able to believe that God commanded me on pain of Hell to be so learned. So I closed all the books. Only one is open before my eyes, it is that of nature. It is in this great and sublime book that I learn to serve and to adore its divine author: nobody can be excused from reading him there, because he speaks to all men in a language intelligible to every mind" (45.10; 624). 1. The projection of the oppositional structure nature- culture at the heart of the lexical field offered by book com- pels us first to consider: (a) that nature, a unique book of its kind, is opposed to all types of books of all kinds; (b) that the book of nature contains the supreme teaching, which is not properly speaking a Science; (c) that every book that carries the science of the learned is to be closed; (d) nevertheless it is under the form of a book that culture takes its metaphorical revenge against nature, because the latter is organized around the Vicar's reflection with all the cognitive and perspectivai apparatus of a book. 2. Table 4 shows the occurrence of livre(s). The preoccu- pation with the book and with books is proper and essential to the third part of the "Profession" Its presentation in the lexical profiles is so much more explosive that in a page and a half Rousseau produces 18 of the 24 occurrences included in the third part (40.19-41.49; 618-620). This cluster opens with the question "Do you wish to be instructed in books?" The single occurrence of libraries (bibliothèques) in the "Profession" em- phasizes the immensity of the readings that have to be done Table 4.

A series of convergent oppositional structures shows the contradictions internal to this universe of libraries and books: the diversity of languages, contrary selections that refute one another, faulty reasoning exposed, the distortion between ef- fective expression and the sentiment of the author, discord between various types of discourse according to the inter- locutor, a dependence on beliefs, customs, and prejudices, the absence of communication between peoples, the difficulty of translations and interpretations, cases of involuntary igno- rance exposed to infernal punishments, a critique of the evi- dence to be found in books, problems of censorship and of condemnations that make books marginal with respect to one another. 3. This violent diatribe against books includes two poles of repulsion. In this short context bossuet's book (40.30; 618) enters at the most heated point: it allows the contradiction to be carried to the very heart of the Catholic religion, because if that faith is judged according to this book the result is far from the account that follows "from living among us," in the faith according to the Vicar. One finds in it the divergences of a double language: Bossuet does not speak the same language to Protestants as to the Catholic people, his book has no resemblance whatever to the instructions found in sermons. Now earlier the "scandal" concerning the book of Nieuventit had been denounced: "How could this man wish to write a book of the marvels of nature which show the wisdom of its author?" (1 1.42; 580). Whether it be a matter of theology or of physics, of religion or of nature, no book is in a position to speak with truth, because, as soon as there are books, internal tensions that feed on themselves provoke the breakdown of culture into as many sources of contradiction as there are authors, nations, and customs. Furthermore, these tensions lead to intolerance, since scientists and theologians argue with one another's books and among themselves, even about facts that have "no need of commentary," as the Note (e) to the cluster mentioned above reminds us.</page><page sequence="18">534 SOCIAL RESEARCH 4. Considered as objects existing in nature, books introduce into it a principle of dispersion and heterogeneity (which Dom Deschamps will utilize to the full in replacing the antithetical element of the book, the Gospel, by the New System, and in condemning all libraries to the flames, including his own book as soon as it has had its effect). If books represent the pole of anti-NATURE, the invocation of the book of nature must appear in its turn as an anti-BOOK. This is what emerges most importantly from the negative element that every metaphor includes, because it negates all or part of the proper sense of the vehicle. Now in this case book of nature diverges radically from every proper sense assignable to book. The nature of the book, one might say, is to abolish the book of nature. However, one book seems to find favor, of which it cannot be said that it is the book according to biblical tradi- tion because it is made quite clear that only "the gospel" is a "book at once so sublime and so simple" (45.44; 625) and that "the books of the Philosophers with all their pomp are small in comparison with it" (45.43). An ultimate and brutal disillu- sionment: "With all this that same gospel is full of incredible things, things repugnant to reason, which it is impossible for any man of sense to conceive or admit! What are we to do amid all these contradictions?" (46.47; 627): adopt the final attitude of the Vicar on "involuntary skepticism." 5. Thus all books, including a book momentarily privileged against books, are exposed to radical suspicion. A simple op- positional structure would free expression from all recourse to metaphor: Deschamps, on the same question, appeals to a nature without culture and without books, to a nature grasped as existence, according to its own strict vocabulary, and not as a spoken or written language. However, the metaphor of the book of nature, which breaks out in part 3, on the subject of books that bear a revelation not to be apprehended by the heart, is only the reinforcement, on the visual and cultural level of natural reli- gion, of the operation of the voice of nature so characteristic</page><page sequence="19">VICAIRE SAVOYARD 535 of part 2. Under the general cover of language of nature the visual metaphor of the book was largely taken over by the auditive metaphor of the voice. nature being set forth as language, the metaphor is en- riched by a transcending of the positive sense of the object, as a means of reading, and a raising of the metaphor to the second power: the book as voice, as speech (parole), address- ing itself to man as much in the form of writing as in that of utterance.7 1. In the strict sense, that of the book given to be read by the eye, nature is a "book open to all eyes" (45.11), in which one can "see the spectacle of nature" (32.01). This external direction of regard is fundamentally subject to reflection be- cause the rules of natural illumination require, in order to appear clearly, that this direction be interiorized. This writing is not inscribed in an objective nature, as a thing among things, but in me, in my consciousness, rules that "I find deep in my heart written by nature in ineffaceable characters" (22.19); "also i read these words written in my soul: be just, and thou shalt be happy" (18.14). The metaphor is pursued as far as the graphic imagery of printing the book, thus declaring the immutability of the message recorded deep in the human heart. For the rest the rare occurrences of reading and of read bring with them two secondary effects. On the one hand, God "reads in my heart" this profession of faith, "he who reads in the depths of my heart knows full well that I do not love my blindness." On the other hand, this communication of the language of nature in writing yields to a very strong utilization of the voice, this book of nature being more a speaking book than a book to be read, a book for listening to a voice 7 Rousseau allows himself to be carried away by these approaches to sensitive being by using in the development the story of a deaf man . . . with whom he converses: "Think of a deaf man who denies the existence of sounds because they have never struck his ear. . . . The deaf man sees the string vibrate. I say to him. . . . Not at all, he replies. . . . Show me then, / say again. ... I cannot, replies the deaf man . . . how should I go about explaining that by your senses of which I have not the slightest idea ..." (15.10; 585).</page><page sequence="20">536 SOCIAL RESEARCH more than a book for the regard of the eye. Rousseau himself slides naively from visual language to oral language: "in this great and sublime book . . . nobody is excused for not reading, because it speaks to all men a language intelligible to all minds" (45.14). It is more a matter of oral reading than of visual reading. 2. In effect the metaphor of the book is deployed fruitfully, starting in part 2, in the direction of the auditive domain of sense: speech- voice, with the literary success of the voice of nature, stronger than that of the gods (24.37), bringing in reason (25.30). The voice of the master of nature, opposed to that of his minister (35.10-35.30). The 17 occurrences of voix (voice), well sustained in the ensemble of the "Profession" (4, 9, 4), alternate with this speaking (dire) of nature: "nature speaks to your senses: live long in the happy state where its voice is that of innocence" (01.30). Innocence which causes the voice of the soul (2 occ.) to be heard against the law of the body, this interior voice (3) which cries, speaks, which wishes to make itself heard by the deaf (15.24), the voice of conscience (5 occ.) opposed to the voice of the world, an IMPORTUNATE VOICE, which SPEAKS Or NO LONGER ANSWERS (27.01, 27.03, 29.12), which causes the cry of remorse to be heard (24.06). At the other extremity of the speaking chain, this rhetoric implies a receiver who listens, hears this lan- guage of nature (27.03), opposed to the clamorous voice of the world (27.08). This voice of nature (24.37, 25.30) is given an exalted style: a holy, immortal, celestial, inno- cent voice, constituting the excellence of the nature of MAN. A double reinforcement amplifies this voice of nature: (a) in the same second part are found the expressions i say to myself, i said to myself (27.14; 601 sq.); (b) this participation attributed to the self, to conscience, brings God into the con- versation: i converse with the author of the order of the universe (30.07), i ask of him. . . .8 8 We do not elaborate on the elements of the process of personification that allows</page><page sequence="21">VICAIRE SAVOYARD 537 This speaking on the part of nature begins from the open- ing of the second part which is characterized by it, rhetorically, stylistically, philosophically, and lexically. From an inquiry into laws as objects of knowledge, the Vicar passes to an inquiry into maxims for action, psychological consciousness becomes moral. This turn is initiated by a doubling of the voice: for if human nature is so contradictory, it is because two voices speak in it at once: "Conscience is the voice of the soul, the passions are the voice of the body. Is it surprising that these two lan- guages contradict one another, and in this case which should be listened to?" (22.10; 594). Part 2 is distinguished from part 3 by the passage from speaking (dire) to reading (lire), from the voice to the spectacle, from speech to the book. This lexicographical ar- chitectonic subtends the difference between a level of moral conscious- ness that grapples with a disposition to listen and a level of religious consciousness that grapples with revealed injunctions that can be read. This melange of feeling in metaphysical discourse is at once strikingly differentiated and convergent. In conclusion, methodologically speaking, let me emphasize the perfect suitability of this type of approach for the un- covering of metaphor. Ancestral fears keep the objection often ringing in our ears: You will never be able to study metaphor "by computer"! Which means that the study of direct dis- course at least is conceded, which is all right for semiotics - but Semantics! This religious mentality forgets only that it is nec- essary, starting from one sign or from the other, for a trace to this proliferation of a metaphor that is strongly dominant in part 2. In effect na- ture is understood as an active force: it "has placed" barriers between the species (11.42); it "desired" that we should not always suffer (17.20, 17.42), it "shows its intentions" (11.42), it "prescribes," "permits" (01.27). To such a degree that it "is the cause" of order: it "was not satisfied" to establish order, it "took measures" to ensure that nothing would disturb order (12.01) and the cult of God is "dictated by nature" (14.07). The inverse propositions have to be clarified: that nature is animated by a will other than itself (09.08), that self-active Being is the source of everything that hap- pens. As can be observed, a double lexical couple is in play here: active nature is assimilable to God, but if it is God who acts, nature is the passive world or universe.</page><page sequence="22">538 SOCIAL RESEARCH be inscribed on the basis of which an exacerbation of sense will be produced. That the "Profession" of the Vicar should fur- nish the proof of this is not without irony. An Example of Paléographie Discrimination: The Appearance of ordre in the Composition of the "Profession" Occurrences of ordre and Versions of the "Profession y The general distribution of occurrences of ordre is furnished by the tables above; 41 occurrences are to be observed in all, 21 in part 1, 10 in part 2 (which is only half as long as part 1), 9 in part 3 and 1 in the notes. This means a constant proportion of uses of ordre in parts 1 and 2, and a clear diminution in part 3. ordre therefore plays a lexicographical role different from that of the collective nouns we have examined, given that its presence is required in the ensemble of the work and that the framework of discourse appeals to it in a constant manner, although privileged in 1 and 2. Let us pursue the observation further. In part 1, after an occurrence at the beginning of the text, we have to wait until 10.27 to find the second occurrence: the 19 others are distrib- uted all the way to the end of part 1. Part 2 does without ordre for 8 pages, because the item does not reappear until 28.04, to open the way for 10 occurrences by the end of part 2. As for part 3, the two first pages do not include ordre, but 8 occurrences in this part are grouped between 32.30 and 38.30; then ordre disappears for 13 pages to re-emerge with the terminal occurrence at 51.21. Because these objectifying procedures incite a heuristic questioning that takes its departure from the observations made, the question which forms itself here is very clearly posed: there are in the "Profession" clusters9 of ordre and 0 We process electronically a "coefficient of clustering," which the computer pro- duces algebraically and which shows how the lexical forms of a text are grouped or dispersed in their uses, the places where groupings, already designated by lists of occurrences, are found with their index of frequency in the course of a work.</page><page sequence="23">VICAIRE SAVOYARD 539 gaps without any use of the term. Does this observation have any philosophical significance? Is this utilization carried out here and there with discernment on the author's part, or does some other factor come into play, which evinces or calls for the occurrences of ordre? It goes without saying that the conscious articulations of discourse govern the accent placed by the author on a lexical form; but these objectifying procedures abstract as far as pos- sible from psychological causes or brilliant literary abstractions which bring into play terms which would then require expla- nation, like transparency or shadow. This rhythmic structure would permit a deeper examination of the recourse to the term ordre in the construction of the "Profession." But our attention had to be rapidly turned in a quite different direc- tion: to paléographie resources which, bringing in manuscripts of different provenance, allowed emphasis to be placed on a conclusion important both for the paléographie examination of the "Profession" and for the metaphysical effort contrib- uted by the author, precisely for this intimate process of com- position. The table of appearances is enough to show clearly three major groups of pages where ordre emerges in clusters: 20 occurrences between 10.27 and 22.09; 10 occurrences between 28.04 and 30.40; 8 occurrences between 32.30 and 38.30. Inversely, the preferential presence defines the lacunae of ordre from the beginning of the text to 10.27 (566-570), from 22.10 to 28.04 (594-602), from 30.40 to 32.30 (606- 608), and from 48.41 to the end (629-end). Further, three works are available that relate to the "Profes- sion" and rest on careful paleography.10 If they are taken 10 P.-M. Masson, in his Édition critique de la Profession . . . (Paris, 1914), unfortu- nately used the first draft as his reference, which makes the development leading to the definitive text inaccessible. The disposition is far from being clear in the restitu- tion that has been carried out. The Pléiade edition, vol. 4 of the Oeuvres Completes of J.-J.

We know in fact that the "Profession" was the object of slow and progressive work on Rousseau's part, which engendered the following states of composition: (F): the Favre manuscript (Geneva), which includes four sorts of distinctive elements in comparison to the definitive printed version:11 large gaps, or texts that were written after (F); texts that remain peculiar to (F), which did not carry over into subsequent drafts; variants with respect to the evolution of the text in the subsequent manuscripts; notes which have not very much to do with (F). This first draft is much less voluminous than the following ones. (P): the manuscript of the Library of the National Assembly, which derives from (F) but which derives also from other already completed writings; and which includes numerous ad- ditions in original handwriting. (G): the Geneva manuscript that served for the composition of the first edition and which includes a small number of erasures, variants, and additions. (D): the first edition produced by Duchesne, which was the object of careful attention and which includes some variants, introduced at the proof stage, in comparison to (G). (C): marginal additions entered by Rousseau in his copy of (D), and other additions included in a notebook from Neuchatel. (M): the copy of the "Profession" put aside in the keeping of Moultou (Geneva), which presents only some rare variants. Table 5 shows the distribution of ordre in the respective variants is restored, but these, relegated to the end of the volume, require gymnastics for their consultation. Furthermore the work on the variants is incomplete. See also Peter D. Jimack, La Genèse et la rédaction de l'Emile (Geneva, 1960). 11 In his article on "Le manuscrit Favre de YEmile," which he had access to because of his family, Leopold Favre discusses this text according to these four rubrics: but they are very incomplete and inexact (Annales de la Société J.-J.

The three strong groupings of ordre are brought into relief by its occurrences. It allows them to be referred systematically to the manuscripts in which the "Profession" was composed: 30 occurrences ap- pear in (F), 10 enter in addition in (P), 1 is introduced in (G). This remark allows us to draw a first major conclusion: no occurrence of ordre in the "Profession" appears there after the stabilization of the text achieved in (G), where the last occurrence is inserted. No rectification on the point enters during the correcting of proof, not in Rousseau's marginalia, nor in Moultou's copy, done after the stabilized text. It is therefore during the period of creative composition of the work, before its stabilization in (G), that the occurrences of ordre precipitated them- selves under Rousseau's pen.12 12 Furthermore, the erased or abandoned passages include, according to the manu-</page><page sequence="26">542 SOCIAL RESEARCH Zones of Appearance of ordre. Let us examine each zone in function of these gaps or clusters of ordre, according to their places in the paléographie strata of the composition. Zl. We will call Zl the zone which extends from the begin- ning of the "Profession" to the first cluster of ordre, which appears at 10.27 (578). A single occurrence is found in this zone. This first occurrence of ordre de la nature (01.25; 566) appears in the sequence of the composition of (F). The propo- sition is first launched in the following direction: "However experience has made me feel that it persists in following the order of nature even against the voice of prejudice." After an attempt which lays emphasis on "the voices of men" to arrive at "the laws of men," and then in (P) at "all the laws of men," the proposition reaches equilibrium from (F) on : "however I know from my experience that it persists in following the order of nature against all the laws of men" (Masson, p. 40). This occurrence remains isolated through the ten pages that lead to the second occurrence in 10.27. What are the conditions of the appearance of this second occurrence? It does not figure in (F). It is situated at the end of the very long addition in (P) that occupies two-thirds of the text of this zone 1. Rousseau searches for the formula: "Far from being able to imagine / harmony (le concert) I accord / no order in the fortuitous concourse of elements, I cannot even imagine their struggle ..." (Masson, p. 116). ordre is graphically superposed on the two erased attempts concert and accord. It is this crucial indication that opens up at once the study of the organizing intelligence and the resumption of the manuscript (F). Thus if one follows the manuscript (F), the order of nature invoked from the second paragraph of the "Profession" is not scripts, 7 occurrences of ordre which were tried out in propositions leading in diverse directions.</page><page sequence="27">VICAIRE SAVOYARD 543 so distant from the beginning of the first cluster, especially if one is inclined to think that the opening paragraphs deal with the experience of the Vicar, the dispositions to uncertainty and doubt that make him evoke Descartes, the consultation of the philosophers and the need to have recourse to interior illumination. He continued soon enough, or rather began, philosophically speaking, by the evocation of ordered relations, of the sensible order of the universe, with a whole cluster of ordre. Two remarks are required here. 1. The paragraph "Let us compare the particular ends . . ." had been the object of a preliminary essay that did not survive in that form in the definitive draft and which appears among the abandoned passages of manuscript (F). Two paragraphs (PI. 216; Masson 499) came several sheets earlier and had been abandoned in this passage of Book IV, along with the dozen following paragraphs: these last would be reutilized almost unchanged in the "Profession." But the two which remain abandoned contain in their short space 3 occurrences of ordre, 1 of ordonner, and 5 of rapport(s). On this short page are found: (a) a draft which is a function of the evolving disposition of the studies, which really belong to the canvas of Emile, which involves moreover the presence of the last of these occurrences of ordre, the certain order of the gradual development of the faculties of the mind. Now this graded ascent reaches its highest point as "the most im- portant knowledge of all" is touched upon. This knowledge is not at all defined in general as an appeal to "philosophy," but to a strict problem of the problematic of knowledge itself. It is a question of passing from the simple apprehension of objects to ideas: this comes about when "to the absolute image of the object are joined the relations (rapports) that determine it" (PI. 216). (b) Once introduced in this way, the term rapport (rela- tion) is frequently reverted to: it is the consideration of rela- tions that produces reflection, which allows the construction of a "general system," which allows mind to arrive at "contem- plation," because "the sublime ideas of order, and that of the</page><page sequence="28">544 SOCIAL RESEARCH beautiful which is only the appearance of relations well- ORDERED in view of an end common to all in the matter in question, are born of contemplation" (PL 216). (c) The second abandoned paragraph is of great importance, no longer in connection with the origin of the idea of order but in connec- tion with its nature and its role: "It follows from this that the human mind is able to elevate itself to the contemplation of the universe and of the admirable order we observe to reign there only after having examined for a long time the structure of parts and the conjunction of relations from which the total system, united in a single idea, is born: to sense that a supreme intelligence governs this immense machine, we must be in a position to discern in at least some aspect the natural play of the parts, the proportion of their masses, their forces, and their movements, and to know some of the laws by which each element combines in the conservation of the whole" (PL 216). The manuscript (F) therefore acquired its philosophical momentum directly from this text when it continued, accord- ing to the original draft, with the paragraph "Let us compare the particular ends . . .," which takes up again the terms and the problematic of the abandoned passage, but without the perspective of order in the drafts. Rousseau was therefore perfectly aware of the philosophical importance of the prob- lem, because he leaves aside the preceding paragraphs of Book IV which deal with it, and of the need to proceed to a deeper examination of this idea of order, which constitutes the essence of human intelligence and divine reason. 2. The reference to this earlier text is certainly primary in the resumption of manuscript (F), in spite of the presence in the draft of other occurrences of order in the preceding paragraph: "I judge the order of the world. . . ." According to (F), this paragraph had been written after "Let us compare . . ." and was put in this introductory position by (P). A triple result can now therefore be stressed: 1. The preoccupation with the idea of order arises slightly before the pages that open the "Profession" properly speak-</page><page sequence="29">VICAIRE SAVOYARD 545 ing, in a passage relieved of its genetic and pedagogical prob- lematic and reutilized in virtue of a static and fundamental problematic. It is no longer the birth of the idea of order that Rousseau emphasizes, but its mature and universal significance, order is not only the accidental terminus of the evolution of the human mind, it is its intimate essence. 2. The first occurrence of order only marks out a path by means of the structure in opposition to human laws that the "experiences" of the Vicar have entailed; according to (F) the study of the idea of order was primary, and this essence of human intelligence offered the key at once to nature and to mind. 3. The long text interpolated by (P) breaks, as Masson has remarked, the original momentum of the composition of (F), but for reasons Masson did not see at all clearly because of philosophical inadequacy. What in fact is the point of this long interpolation? The study of order as proper to understanding is postponed be- cause of it by the two types of consideration that concern existence, and then the essence of matter and motion. Now this long passage entirely obscures the term order. Why? 1. It can first be said that it does not belong to the same episode of writing. As the editors have remarked, it appears in fact in (P), but already in a state of writing that presupposes the existence of preliminary sketches. 2. The sources of this passage are clearly indicated on the whole and are related to the polemic against Helvetius, to the reading of the articles "Evidence" and "Existence" in the En- cyclopedia, to Rousseau's references to his Institutions chimiques, etc. The break in reflection is therefore completely confirmed by the paléographie break. Let us say on this point that Rousseau's philosophical effort is solidly reinforced by this appeal to the study of existence and motion, but with a little more philosophy nothing would have prevented him from introducing the idea of order into such considerations.</page><page sequence="30">546 SOCIAL RESEARCH Above all Masson's interpretive tendency here is entirely false. Masson concludes in effect that the manuscript (F), which he presents in its first rough outline, "lightens" the "Profession"; this text thus finds itself "liberated" (pp. xxxix and xl of his Introduction) and appears as a "sentimental manifesto" (p. 125). The first draft, without this long addition from (P), was much less "philosophical." It would be desirable to look into Masson's "philosophy." If the idea of order is not philosophical, in contrast to weighty considerations of existence and motion, if these long developments in which the term order will clear itself a paléographie passage do not contribute to a philosophical reinforcement from (F) on, then Masson is right. In fact what we find, on the contrary, from (F) on is a strongly metaphysical reversion toward a founding problematic that has its source in a philosophy of order. The abandoned text directed attention in a very rich direction, on which the Malebranchist line up to Lignac, whom Rousseau had just read, and to Marie Huber, discoursed at length. No doubt because of the fact that order seems to Masson accessible only through the universal harmonies that call to nature and conscience, he reduces the search for it to a sentimental understanding, in opposition to all Rousseau's ex- pressions which affirm it as an idea. According to Masson, the existence of an original "Profession", that of manuscript (F), "more in conformity with the profound temperament of Jean-Jacques," must be inferred. But nothing could be more mistaken than to state that the spectacle of nature, the voice of conscience, such were the only two authorities to which the Vicar at first appealed. No subtle discussions of technical philosophy. The disquisitions he inserted later on sensation, judgment, substance, matter and motion are still absent. Thus lightened, it must be admitted that the "Profession" of the Vicar had a more moving, a more popular, and in a sense more Rousseauist character ... (p. xxxix). We admit no such thing and prefer to follow the end of</page><page sequence="31">VICAIRE SAVOYARD 547 Masson's sentence, which is in part contradictory: "although all this laborious and ingenuous metaphysics testifies in its way to the courageous effort Rousseau made to come to terms once and for all with the essentially intellectual difficulties of the problem of God." And yet the "intellectual problem of God" is grasped in its breadth and depth starting from manu- script (F) and, as we show, the essence of the metaphysical structure of this text is already wholly in place in it, very metaphysically. In effect the pages that follow, taking up the original thread of (F), have as their very material the idea of ORDER. Z2: This zone 2 is defined, according to the table of occur- rences of ordre, by the cluster that stretches from V. 10.27 to V.21.38 (PL 578-593). If we leave out V.10.27, which we have just examined and which, in (P), effects the return to (F), 19 occurrences of ordre are to be counted in this section. Of these 19 occurrences, 16 appear from the first draft of (F), 3 are interpolated by (P) and 1 by (G). Let us look at the situation of these occurrences in the text. V. 10.42: This occurrence, as we said, was at first placed with its paragraph at the end of a page in (F) (Masson, p. 132, moved back to p. 123). The occurrence that comes in the following sentence (V. 10.43) also forms part of the same graphic movement. Here is its origin: "You will ask me how I judge the order of the world . . . Because to judge this order . . ." (Masson, p. 132). Observe that when its place is changed in the new arrangement of (P), this paragraph no longer concedes anything to the Vicar considered as engaged in dialogue with Emile. At this point, whatever Masson may say, it is rather Rousseau who affirms philosophically: "I judge of the order of the world . . ." (PL 578). In instigating this change in the position of the paragraph, Rousseau thus places at the beginning of the development that he devotes to ordering intelligence a very clear and very detailed affirma- tion, answering to the best combinatorial philosophy, quite</page><page sequence="32">548 SOCIAL RESEARCH distinct from the more mechanistic considerations formerly added in (P), turning these considerations to existence, matter, and motion, to assume all their weight through these reflec- tions on order. Finally this serves then as an introduction to "Let us compare the particular ends . . .," which leads in the next occurrence, found in (F) since the first draft: "to what unprej- udiced eyes does the sensible order of the universe not proc- laim a supreme intelligence . . ." (V.I 1.10). V.I 1.50: The paragraph "I read Nieuventit with surprise . . ." at first ends with the long treatment of the plant growing from seed. This first development included no case of order (PI. 223). It is (P) that suppresses this external consideration, to reinforce the philosophical language of the end of the paragraph with the remark: "It [nature] was not satisfied with the establishment of order. . . ." V. 12.37: ordre does not find its final place at once. In (F), the first draft stipulates with hesitation: Whether matter is eternal or created, whether it has a passive principle or none at all, still it is certain that / everything is ordered by / a unique intelligence; for I see nothing / in the progress of the order of things / in the nature of things which belies itself / which is not ordered in the same system and does not contribute to the same end, that is the conservation of the whole. It is only in (G) that ordre tried out, then erased, is retrieved at the end of the proposition: "that is the conservation of the whole in the established order." Here again Rousseau rein- forces a text whose initial sense was nevertheless extremely clear. V.I 3.34: This occurrence does not appear in (F), but did so in (P) in the following form: "What! I can know (connaître) what order, virtue, moral beauty, are. . . ." Copy (M) and the definitive text have: "I can feel what order is" (Masson, pp. 154, 158, 161). In this it can be seen that the arrangement held to by Masson is not easy to consult, and that, if one takes the trouble to follow in detail, it is evident here again that</page><page sequence="33">VICAIRE SAVOYARD 549 Rousseau has passed from "know" (connaître) to "feel," which is the opposite direction to the one Masson generally favors. V. 13.45: It is again in (P) that this occurrence of order of beings appears, which seems to have been added in the mar- gin in (F). V.14.12: "Where is the order I had observed" appears directly in (F); similarly for V. 16.43. V. 17.40: The first draft of (F) has: "I see in the system of the universe an admirable order that in no way belies itself (Masson, p. 196). This passage becomes: "I see in the system of the world an order that in no way belies itself." Indepen- dently of a possible commentary on the alternation universe/world, which we have studied elsewhere, Rousseau drops the adjective "admirable." V.I 8.07 and V. 10.08 appear jointly in the margin of (F) and the repetition of love of order passes into all the manu- scripts. V. 18.43: "Everything comes back to order at death" is given from the beginning in (F). V.19.14 brings into play from (F) "the maintenance of moral order"; the following draft, which drops "moral," is far more universal and reinforces this entry of death itself into philo- sophical order. In the same paragraph "the beauty of order" also occurs at first writing, V. 19.37. V. 20.07 ends that same paragraph, but neither in (F) nor in (P). This terminal formula appears in (G). We noticed in (F) "What reason can I have to refuse [assent] to it?" (Masson, p. 212). The erasure is of importance because the argumentation is no longer founded in relation to a reason he might have, but on the affirmation of a highly general metaphysical "sup- position": "I only suppose the laws of order to be observed, and God to be constant to himself." This is a purely Male- branchist proposition. V. 21. 37-38: One has to go back and forth between pp. 148 and 229 of Masson to find the origin in (F) of the two follow- ing occurrences of ordre. The drafting of the first occurrence</page><page sequence="34">550 SOCIAL RESEARCH comes in the original text, but the second is a very clear marginal reinforcement: "for it is through order. . . ." With this occurrence the cluster we have just unpacked across the paléographie layers comes to an end. What can we observe in conclusion? This first cluster of ordre is set up long before by an earlier text that remains unused. This text is consulted to resolve an ambiguity with respect to elements contributed by (P), which eliminated every occurrence of ordre as a result of its dif- ferent paléographie origin. In the original draft of (F) this ensemble followed a rapid general introduction on the cir- cumstances and the method of the "Profession." In the body of these texts, ordre crops up, in most of its occurrences, from (F) on, with several reinforcements under erasure or in the margin observable in (F). (P) and (G) will bring four reinforcements. We may draw a first conclusion: The manuscript (F) is the one in which Rousseau tries out the term ordre with a view to making it the central idea of these metaphysical meditations. The reworkings of (F) and the four later additions testify to a concentrated examination that reinforces the philosophical formulations and modifies the originally less structured arguments. Masson is therefore right to emphasize the "intellectual" attention paid by Rousseau to the constitution of this fundamental metaphysics, but this attention is originating (originaire), it is directed and channeled by the idea of order. There is no passage here from temperament to understanding, nor from a sentimental manifesto to a metaphysical treatise. From the first draft one is drawn toward a meditation on the idea of order which intensifies, to be sure, but because from the beginning it engrosses all the graphic energy of the author. It may however be that (F) is not the first paléographie source of this passage, and that there had already been a beginning draft of these clusters of ordre in the "notebooks." In fact the opening passage of the reworking of (F) is marked by the indication "let us listen etc. in the notebook," which</page><page sequence="35">VICAIRE SAVOYARD 551 means that the paragraph "Let us listen to the interior senti- ment . . .," which brings back the consideration of order, had already been sketched in a notebook. The same remark occurs a little further on where Rousseau notes in (F): "go back to the notebook," this for the paragraph "There is not a being in the universe . . ." (Masson, pp. 64 and 136). This cluster of ordre may therefore have been the object of an essay preliminary to the systematic placement to be observed at the level of the first draft of manuscript (F). Were there in these notebooks some pages13 reserved to various quotations relative to ordering intelligence? 13: The second gap in ordre extends from this last occur- rence to the one that arises afresh in V.28.04. The last occur- rence figured in 21.38. Now it is in V. 2 1.09 that the discourse changes and the helm is turned toward what we call part 2, which Masson entitles: "passage from metaphysics to morals: conscience" (p. 231). Now the learned editions inform us (Masson, p. 234) that a significant paléographie thread is introduced by Rousseau himself in manuscript (F): "NB whether it is true that the good is good. 5th letter to Sophie." In fact if one marks those paragraphs where, according to the handwriting, Rousseau again becomes, as in the first gap, the copyist of another manuscript, one notices that from V. 22.40 to V. 26.46 (PI. 595-601) the text followed is that of Letter 5, and that from V.26.47 to V.27.45 Letter 6 is followed. The correlation be- tween these passages can be established in Masson, who pub- lishes at the end of his book what he rightly considers to be the first sketches of the "Profession"; one can follow it more con- veniently in comparing PI. 595-602 with PI. 1106-1113. 13 Among the sheets expressly reserved by Rousseau for the "Profession," but which remained unused, we note: "Although what men do there [is] of small moment relatively to the whole, [it] is a necessity of their nature not to transgress certain limits within which nothing that happens can upset the total order" (Masson p. 507).</page><page sequence="36">552 SOCIAL RESEARCH Once again the gap in ordre is directly related to the copyist's attitude that the author assumes in relation to an earlier draft which included neither this lexical form ordre, nor this concern for a metaphysical foundation characteristic of manuscript (F). We will examine later the poverty of the presence of ordre in the ensemble of the Letters to Sophie. A second lexical and reflexive discontinuity is thus occasioned by recourse to other written elements, which interrupt the draft in progress.14 Z4: The second cluster of ordre falls between V.28.04 and V.30.13 (PI. 602-605). This zone corresponds to the end of our part 2, the part which is precisely no longer copied from the Letters to Sophie, and where manuscript (F) resumes its sketchlike appearance. A very tight cluster because in three pages we find 10 occurrences of ordre, all issuing directly from (F). From (F) on we have the definitive version, with in addition this significant question at V.28.04 which was erased: "Love of order, what does this word mean?" Then there follow quickly amour de l'ordre (love of order) (V. 28.08) and ordre moral (moral order) (28.09). V.28.29 and 28.30 were at first inserted in the following trial sketch in (F): "I hold my will in order, established by himself, in order to profit from it. . . ." (P) provokes the outburst: "I acquiesce in the order that he establishes, sure one day myself to profit from this order . . ." (Masson, p. 282). V.28.45 and V.20.04 figure in (F) from the first draft of this paragraph. In the same paragraph 3 occurrences are found: V.30.04 comes as early as (F), but V.30.11 and V.30.13 result from a repetition to be found in (F), but not in the first draft. This is 14 The only note to the "Profession" that includes an occurrence of ordre is situated in this passage at V.26.54 (PL 4: 1559) where it occurs only as part of the critical apparatus. This note appears for the first time in (P) and there is nothing corre- sponding to it in (F), l'ordre de cette affection (the order of this affection) is in place from the first draft, conserved in (M), but was omitted in (G) and in the first edition.</page><page sequence="37">VICAIRE SAVOYARD 553 what we read at first: "I who must love the order he makes, would I wish him to be troubled for me." The outburst is double. It bears first of all on the quality of this love, since (P) adds "to love order above all things," which (M) and the definitive version print as "to love order above all . . ." (Mas- son, p. 294). The second reinforcement involves the second occurrence of ordre: "do I wish this order" from (F), "would I wish this order" according to (P), which becomes defini- tive.15 Masson himself observes, with respect to these terminal par- agraphs of our part 2: "It is here that the idea of God, which might have seemed to be abandoned, reappears: it presents itself at the conclusion of the moral inquiry to guarantee the affirmations of conscience and to establish conscience defin- itively above reason" (p. 279, n. 2). For Masson the "senti- mental manifesto" appeals to "conscience" and not to "rea- son." This is not the place for an examination of that question, which can be approached in a quite different sense. It is enough to remark that, lexicographically, we have marked this place trivially, and that the relation to different paléographie series and discontinous turns of writing sustain this observa- tion. One may therefore say, if this draft of (F) is now placed so as to follow the end of the first cluster of ordre, that there results a remarkable coherence of paléographie, lexical, and reflective structures. 15: The short space that separates this last occurrence (V.30.13) from that which opens the third cluster of ordre at V.32.30 is, rhetorically, occupied by the transition from part 1 15 Two further occurrences in this passage should be disallowed, because a marginal addition of (F) was not used at the end of this paragraph. The passage first ended with "in its first independence / freedom," which (P) transformed into "will." It is here that the addition proper to (F) is attached: "his sovereign happiness is not to submit himself to order but is that order is his work. . . ." This draft would have reinforced the cluster of order in this place even more.</page><page sequence="38">554 SOCIAL RESEARCH to part 2, according to Rousseau, that is parts 2 and 3 of our reading. This transitional passage does not put forward any philosophical reflection, as is the case for the very beginning of the "Profession." Z6: The third cluster of ordre is deployed from V.32.30 to V.38.30 (PI. 608-616). Notice first that the study of verbal constellations betokens a strong polysemy of ordre. It is here that we find the occurrence order-commandment, and that two other occurrences point to public order: but in spite of everything 5 of these 8 occurrences still have to do with order in general, according as it concerns nature or, for 3 among them, the supernatural. V.32.30 concerns the order of words that opposes the exterior cult of the priest to the cult of the heart (PI. 608). This occurrence, which is not in (F), appears in (P). In the same paragraph, the occurrence of V.32.36 "for good order" is added only in the margin, apparently at the time of drafting (P). V. 34.45 is not in (F) and appears in (P) with a number of trial propositions which continue in (G). These trials show a desire to introduce considerations which link the problematic of revelation to the earlier metaphysical root. (F) had written: "to know the laws of nature thoroughly." Now it is clearly in the direction of a recourse to the concept of order, superior to that of law, that (P) inserts: "what facts are in the order of nature . . ." and that (G) repeats: "in the order of nature in all its combinations to decide what is a prodigy and what is not /what facts are in the order of nature and what others are not." V.35.20 is not in (F) either. The occurrence is inscribed in the margin of (P) in the following form: "It is the unalterable order of nature which best displays the supreme Being . . .," and in an interrogative form in (M): "Is it not the unalterable order. . . ." V. 35.44, which concerns god's express order is also added</page><page sequence="39">VICAIRE SAVOYARD 555 in the margin of (P). Thus these 5 occurrences are the product of a reinforcement due to (P). The 3 last occurrences in this cluster, which refer to super- natural order, figure in the dialogue between the Inspired Man and the Reasoner. V.38.17 appears in the first instance in (F), V.38.21 enters in the same way, as does V.38.30. Marginal trials furthermore appeal to two other occurrences: "the dis- position of men is not of that order" and "Once more in the order of nature . . ." (Masson, p. 354). It is worth remarking, as to the dialogue, that it had already been tried out elsewhere, for the editors indicate that the text of this passage had few corrections and refer to the Letter to (TAlembert. All the same, the beginning of the Letter to d'Alem- bert, text and notes, taken as a whole, while philosophical in tone brings up no occurrence of ordre and no appeal to the metaphysics of order. Assuming that that is indeed the paléographie origin of this passage, it must once again be admitted that it was in composing (F) that Rousseau had in view this general explanation in terms of order. Z7: From this point on there will be only one occurrence of ordre in the whole of this long conclusion of the "Profession," at V.48.41 (PI. 629), and to appeal to public order, from (F). Does this mean that we might have a lexicographical expla- nation of the internal division of the second part, which Rous- seau sets forth in the second of the Letters from the Mountain? "The whole of the first part [of the "Profession"] of the Vicar is affirmative, half of the second part is still affirmative . . ." (PI. 3:721). The second part that Rousseau describes to de Beaumont can therefore be thought of as divisible. He does not indicate exactly where the division occurs, but the end of the dialogue between the Inspired Man and the Reasoner calls for the discussion to change direction: "So there are plenty of difficulties, my child, and that's not all" (V.40.01; PI. 617). As we have shown elsewhere, it is from this point that the lexico- graphical cluster of livre (book) and livres breaks out, lead-</page><page sequence="40">556 SOCIAL RESEARCH ing the last part of the "Profession" on its strongly critical, if not negative, bent. It must therefore be admitted that the "positive" ends where the occurrences of ordre disappear. Which is a way, voluntary or not, of conferring on the dis- course deep lexical structures that the study of the manu- scripts brings out clearly. General Division into Zones. One might thus complete the table established above by integrating into it the results of the pre- ceding remarks which bring to light the relation of these lexical and paléographie structures to their originating ref- erences (Table 6). Through this study of the setting of ordre, of its principal appearances in the "Profession," we can con- clude that, in all the effort Rousseau expended on the clarifica- tion of the leading and systematic concept of order- ordinancing (ordonnancement), four semiotic vectors of ordre are clearly distinguishable: or(1)dre: rhetorical and logical order, much in vogue in the work of Descartes, attenuated and dispersed in Malebranche, this vector is entirely absent from the "Profession." With exhaustive analyses of the work in hand, the low frequency of such uses (to think according to order, to conduct one's thoughts according to order, etc.) will no doubt be observed.16 or(2)dre: order-commandment finds a use in the "Profession": it is by God's express order that Moses interprets signs (V. 35.44; PI. 612). But part 3 of our segmentation includes two occurrences of the verb ordonner (ordain, command) which illustrate this vector. or(3)dre: order-ordinancing (ordonnancement): it is in the "Profession," and uniquely in this work, that an extended analysis of this concept is to be found, as I have indicated in 16 An extension of this vector is strongly perceptible in Emile in the direction of pedagogical order. The Mémoire à de Mably sought to establish the order of studies, which furthermore is to be the most natural order. The appeals to the Logic of Port-Royal and to Bernard Lamy's l'Art de parler allow the pupil to be exercised "to order and to method in his reasonings" {Mably, p. 29, repeated in Sainte-Marie, p. 50).</page><page sequence="41">VICAIRE SAVOYARD 557 Table 6.

We are spectators of the reordination of the character (the Vicar) and at the same time of the discovery and analysis by the author (Rousseau) of a concept that will carry weight in his "system."17 Translated by Peter Caws 17 The article on "Lexicographie philosophique et paléographique" continues with a comparative examination of these uses of ordre with other works of Rousseau, the Discours, the rest of Emile, etc. These inquiries confirm that only the "Profession" deals with order with this density and this intensity.
