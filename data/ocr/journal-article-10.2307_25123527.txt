KEY WORDS: business as a calling, business ethics, corporate culture, corporate social responsibility, ethical standards, servant leadership, value based management Introduction What might happen if business leaders across the globe viewed their work as a sacred calling in a religious sense? Might not the world be a far better place? This paper is an effort to stimulate debate and discussion on this topic. It begins with a brief review of the concept of ethics in business, foUowed by a listing of various ethical standards which are typicaUy acknowledged in business settings. Legal standards are then explored in greater depth, and the concept of levels of corporate responsib?ity is introduced to beg the question, "Are higher standards than the law needed?" Religious beliefs are then introduced as a possible higher standard, and teachings of the world's great religions are reviewed as they relate to doing business. This discussion culminates in the concept of business as a caUing in a religious sense. The higher standards prescribed in religious thought are then contrasted to the elements of modern corporate culture in an effort to highlight the magnitude of the chaUenge faced by those business leaders seeking to rise to a higher level of morality in business. The paper then describes sev eral ways business leaders might manifest their sense of caUing in the world of business, with particular attention focused on (a) creating an ethical organi zational culture, (b) demonstrating corporate social responsibility, and (c) providing servant leadership. The paper concludes with a chaUenge: Who wiU answer the caU? Ethics in business Ethics has to do with behavior - SpecificaUy, one's moral behavior with respect to society (Sauser, in press a). The extent to which one's behavior mea sures up to societal standards is typicaUy used as a gauge of one's ethicality. There are a variety of standards for societal behavior, of course, so ethical behavior is often characterized with respect to cer tain contexts. The Ethics Resource Center says, "Business Ethics refers to clear standards and norms that help employees to distinguish right from wrong behavior at work" (Joseph, 2003, p. 2). In the William I.

Sauser, Jr. context of doing business, then, ethics has to do with the extent to which a person's behavior measures up to such standards as the law, organizational poUcies, professional and trade association codes, popular expectations regarding fairness and what is right, plus one's own internaUzed moral standards. Business ethics is not an element distinct from ethics in general, but a subfield of the broad area of study known as ethics (Desjardins, 2003, p. 8). There is a complex set of issues and expectations for doing business (which may differ from culture to culture), and the subfield of business ethics refers to the examination and application of moral standards within the context of finance; commerce; produc tion, distribution, and sale of goods and services; and other forms of business. It can be fairly argued that an ethical person be haves appropriately in aU societal contexts. This in deed may be so, in which case one might prefer the term "ethics in business" to "business ethics." The distinction is subtle, but serves as a reminder that morality may be generaUzed from context to con text. Adam Smith, for example, saw no need for ethical relativism when it comes to business: It is impossible to determine just how business became separated from ethics in history. If we go back to Adam Smith, we find no such separation. In addition to his famous book on business and capitaUsm, The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith also wrote The Theory of Moral Sentiments, a book about our ethical obliga tions to one another. It is clear that Smith beUeved that business and commerce worked weU only if people took seriously their obligations and, in particular, their sense of justice. (Bruner et al., 1998, p. 46.) May (1995) echoes this important point: "The marketplace breaks down unless it can presuppose the virtue of industry, without which goods wiU not be produced; and the virtues of honesty and integ rity, without which their free and fair exchange cannot take place" (p. 693). Standards of ethical behavior The law (including statutory, administrative, and case law) is one important and legitimate source of ethical guidance, of course. Federal, state, and local laws establish the parameters within which business is done (Fieser, 1996). Violation of the law is almost always considered unethical behavior (with the possible exception of civil disobedience as a mech anism for putting the law itself on trial). One who pursues business outside the law is considered to be following an obstructionist approach to business ethics (Schermerhorn, 2005, p. 75). Such an indi vidual would almost certainly be labeled "an unethical business person." A second important source of authority consists of organizational policies. These are standards for behavior established by the employing organization. Typically they are in alignment with the law (which takes precedence over them) and spell out in detail "how things are to be done around here." All employees are expected to abide by organizational policies. It is very important that managers at the highest level of the organization set the example for others by working always within the law and the policies of the organization. Likewise, another important source of ethical guidance is the code of behavior adopted by one's professional and trade associations. These are often aspirational in nature, and frequently establish higher standards for behavior than the law requires. Mem bers of a professional or trade association typically seek to meet these higher standards in order to establish and uphold the reputation ?f the profession or trade. A fourth type of standard ? often unwritten and "commonly understood" ? is the community's conceptualization of morality. These social mores, based on commonly held beliefs about "what is right and what is wrong" and "what is fair and what is unfair" can be powerful determinants of one's rep utation in society. Behavior which ? in the strictest sense - meets legal requirements, organizational policies, and even professional standards may still be viewed by the general public as unfair and wrong (Krech et al., 1962). Yet a fifth set of standards are those of the individual conscience. Coleman et al. (1980, p. Glossary IV) define "the conscience" as "the functioning of an individual's moral values in the approval or disapproval of his or her own thoughts and actions," and equate it roughly with the Freudian concept of the superego. Highly ethical business leaders typically have moral standards which exceed all four of the lesser standards listed</page><page sequence="3">Ethics in Business 347 above. These values, learned early in life and reinforced by life's experiences, are internalized standards which are often based on personal reli gious and/or philosophical understandings of morality (Baelz, 1977, pp. 41-55). The role of law What is the role of law in determining moral behavior in business? Hosmer (2003) defines "the law" as: .. .a consistent set of universal rules that are widely published, generaUy accepted, and usuaUy enforced. These rules describe the ways in which people are required to act in their relationships with other people within a society. They are requirements to act in a given way, not just expectations or sug gestions or petitions to act in that way. There is an aura of insistency about the law; it defines what you must do. (p. 64.) The law plays an important - most would say an essential ? part in establishing the moral and practical milieu in which business takes place. Says Fieser (1996), "The law.. .is.. .necessary since the laws are what establish the contractual framework within which businesses operate" (p. 458). Stackhouse (1995a) adds, "Modern business presupposes a stable fabric of law. Law, of course, means limits; there are some things that businesses cannot do and remain legitimately in business" (p. 18). While few business philosophers question the role of the law as a necessary standard of business morality, there is a raging debate over whether the law is a sufficient standard of ethicality in business. In other words, is it enough for the ethical business person to obey the law, or are there higher standards of morality which also must be met? Friedman (1970) argues that the law is both a necessary and sufficient standard of morality in business, and even claims that corporate officers who seek to "go be yond the law" in the name of social responsibility may be breaking trust with corporate shareholders who expect the officers to serve as their agents in making a profit within the law. "What does it mean to say that the corporate executive has a 'social responsibility' in his capacity as a businessman?" asks Friedman. "If this statement is not pure rhetoric, it must mean that he is to act in some way that is not in the interest of his employers" (p. 33). Fieser (1996) disagrees with Friedman regarding this latter claim; Fieser is more sanguine with respect to the corporate officer's voluntary actions to guide the business to act in a socially responsible manner. However, Fieser summarizes his careful examination of the issue of the sufficiency of the law as a moral guideline for business with the "cautious conclu sion" that "the typical business in our society has no moral obligation beyond what the law requires" (p. 465). In contrast, in an elegant treatise on the role of law in business morality, Hosmer (2003) reaches the opposite conclusion: Legal requirements can serve as a guide to managerial decisions and actions, but.. .they are not enough. They don't include the full range of personal goals, norms, beliefs, and values and consequently.. .don't represent the true nature and actual worth of human beings. Legal requirements are useful... [But] we need something more. (pp. 75?76.) Stackhouse (1995a) takes a similar stance: Indeed, much of morality is beyond the law... Law is best when it provides general guidelines for orga nization and action, yet preserves maximum freedom, protects persons and groups from danger or exploi tation, and constrains those who subvert the capacity to live responsibly. The point is this: economics and law cannot generate business morality alone. Something in addition to them must guide business, (p. 18.) So which is it? Does the law provide sufficient moral guidance for business leaders, or is "something else" needed? I weigh in on the side of Hosmer and Stackhouse; however, one's answer to this question will differ depending on one's philosophy about corporate responsibility, an issue to which I now turn. Levels of corporate responsibility Drawing on Carroll's (1979) excellent scholarly work, Schermerhorn (2005) makes these observa tions about four responsibilities of business firms:</page><page sequence="4">348 William I. Sauser, Jr. An organization is meeting its economic responsibiUty when it earns a profit through the provision of goods and services desired by customers. Legal responsibility is fulfilled when an organization operates within the law and according to the requirements of various external regulations. An organization meets its ethical responsibility when its actions voluntarily conform not only to legal expectations but also to the broader values and moral expectations of society. The highest level of social performance comes through the satis faction of an organization's discretionary responsibil ity. Here, the organization voluntarily moves beyond basic economic, legal, and ethical responsibilities to provide leadership in advancing the well-being of individuals, communities, and society as a whole, (pp. 74-75.) Next Schermerhorn (2005), using Gatewood and Carroll (1981) as his guides, describes a fourfold taxonomy of social responsibility strategies: An obstructionist strategy ("Fight the social de mands") reflects mainly economic priorities; social demands lying outside the organization's perceived self-interests are resisted... A defensive strategy ("Do the minimum legally required") seeks to protect the organization by doing the minimum legally nec essary to satisfy expectations. Corporate behavior at this level conforms only to legal requirements, com petitive market pressure, and perhaps activist voices... Organizations pursuing an accommodative strategy ("Do the minimum ethically required") accept their social responsibilities. They try to satisfy economic, legal, and ethical criteria. Corporate behavior at this level is congruent with society's prevailing norms, values, and expectations. But, it may be so only be cause of outside pressures... The proactive strategy ("Take leadership in social initiatives") is designed to meet all the criteria of social performance, including discretionary performance. Corporate behavior at this level takes preventive action to avoid adverse social impacts from company activities, and it takes the lead in identifying and responding to emerging social issues, (pp. 75-76.) Leaders of those business organizations choosing to pursue a corporate strategy of obstruction or defense would likely hold that the law is a sufficient measure of business morality, while those striving to pursue an accommodative or proactive strategy would argue that the law is certainly necessary for this purpose, but not sufficient. Higher standards than the law may be needed. As a business professor, I seek to prepare my students to take leadership roles in society. Accord ingly, I encourage them to adopt the proactive strategy for their businesses, and thus to seek volun tarily to identify and avoid any personal or business actions which might lead to societal harm. This places upon them a higher level of moral expectation than those business persons who "settle for" strate gies lower on the taxonomy of corporate social responsibiUty. I think that is what leadership is aU about: striving to meet the higher standards. The role of religion Might reUgion play a part in determining ethical standards beyond "the law?" Zinbarg (2001) makes an exceUent case for "bringing religion into the picture" with respect to understanding business ethics more fuUy: "Since moral understandings are derived from religious traditions as weU as from secular education, the voices that speak to the issue should be religious as weU as secular" (p. 33). Sim ilarly, Stackhouse (1995b) presents a convincing argument that religion has much to offer the field of business ethics, particularly with respect to issues of vocation, moral law, liberation, sin, covenant, and creation. Baelz (1977) adds this contribution to the argu ment that religion has a role in understanding and applying ethical concepts in business: Religion might exercise a coordinating and integrating function by holding before men's eyes the vision of an ultimate universal order in which the needs of the individual and the needs of humanity were harmo nized. It could bind human beings to one another by binding them aU to something even more inclusive, whether this were conceived in terms of an impersonal order or in terms of a personal God. (p. 65.) Zinbarg (2001) presents an exceUent surnrnary of the ethical principles of the Jewish, Christian, Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, and Confucian traditions, and shows how they converge to provide guidance for behavior in the economic sector. He summarizes his review as foUows:</page><page sequence="5">Ethics in Business 349 If the mosaics of the West and the East were joined, I doubt that a member of any one of the six faith communities would be uncomfortable looking at it. For the marketplace, the mosaic would portray a coherent religious vision of an ideal economic setting. Economic efficiency would not require a sacrifice of human dignity. Economic actors would exhibit mu tual compassion, and individual achievement would not be at the expense of communal solidarity. Steady economic and moral improvement would be pursued with humility and patience, (p. 77.) In a similar vein, Stackhouse (1995c) provides a concise summary of the guidance the Christian faith provides for ethical behavior in economic Ufe. Many of these principles are shared across the great reli gious traditions of the world: Do not lie, cheat, steal, or covet; deal as equitably with the foreigner and the stranger as with the family member and the beloved neighbor; if authority is given to someone, it must not be used to extort or gain advantage; all bounty is to be treated as a trusted and trustworthy steward treats that which is the Lord's. Honor is not to go to the rich and the powerful be cause they are rich and powerful but accordingly as they love mercy, do justice, and walk humbly with God. Further, the greedy accumulation of wealth which removes some from accountability to all others is contrary to God's justice but damaging to the community... Forced poverty is equally contrary to God's justice and destructive of viable economic development. Thus, efforts to call the greedy to ac count, to relieve the needs of the distressed, and to convert both to a disciplined life, are always necessary, (p. 112.) When one holds fast to such religious beliefs, then one seeks to exhibit behavior in daily life and work which conforms to them. In a theological sense, this is considered one's "vocation" or "calling" (McKim, 1996, p. 36). Says the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (1995), "Business people, managers, investors and financiers follow a vital Christian vocation when they act responsibly and seek the common good" (p. 446). This concept may easily be generalized to other faith traditions as well. Sullivan (1995) says, "I think of business as a vocation" (p. 676), and summarizes his effort to respond to his calling as a business leader as follows: What we have tried to do is estabUsh a positive envi ronment for individual and company growth which emphasizes placing responsib?ity on individuals, operating in a decentralized setting dedicated to helping the customer and our company in the long term. FinaUy, we ask our people to go beyond themselves and get involved in their own communi ties, (p. 674.) In Business as a Calling, 2l fascinating book written "for Jews, Christians, MusUms, and others who take the inner Ufe seriously" (p. 1), Novak (1996) describes the benefits that would accrue to all business leaders if they viewed their work as a caUing in this sense: It would give them a greater sense of being part of a noble profession. It would raise their own esteem for what they do - and no doubt stimulate their imagi nations about how they might gain greater and deeper satisfactions from doing it. It would help tie them more profoundly to traditions going far back into the past, in seeing their own high place in the scheme of things. The human project is a universal project. We are involved in bringing the Creator's work to its in tended fulfiUment by being co-creators in a very grand project, indeed. In this, we are tied to the whole hu man race. (p. 37.) How might those who accept business as a caUing translate their passion into action? In their com pendium of thought on moral business, Stackhouse et al. (1995) present a number of thoughtful essays and position statements from a variety of reUgious, historical, economic, and ph?osophical perspectives across the globe. For practical suggestions coming from the world's great religions, these essays and documents provide a rich source of study. Another impressive document - written by per sons from a variety of faith traditions throughout the world - is the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights," adopted and proclaimed by the United Nations on December 10, 1948. What ultimate good might accrue if business leaders across the world took it upon themselves as their caUing to implement the terms of this declaration in every workplace on the globe? Below I describe three other types of action which I beUeve leaders who view business as a caUing can undertake to improve the moral climate of the workplace: (a) create an ethical culture within</page><page sequence="6">350 William I. Sauser, Jr. the organizations they lead, (b) demonstrate corpor ate social responsibility, and (c) provide servant leadership. Before turning to this discussion, how ever, it is necessary to gain a perspective on the scope of the problem we face as we seek to change the current corporate bureaucratic culture which seems to be stifling moral behavior in business. How difficult is the challenge? Corporate bureaucratic culture In 1956 William H. Whyte published The Organi zation Man, a groundbreaking expose of the pressures for conformity found in the typical bureaucratic organization of the 1950s. Whyte's book, a best seller, has become a classic text for study of the sociological problems of large bureaucracies - whe ther they be for-profit corporations, not-for-profit foundations, military units, hospitals, churches, or voluntary associations ? and is still in print today. Says Nocera in his foreword to the 2002 paperback edition of Whyte's classic, "Simply for being so far ahead of the curve, Whyte deserves enormous credit" (p. xv). It is true, as Nocera asserts, that many of the problems inherent in large bureaucracies are now understood and are being addressed. However, a more recent sociological examination of for-profit bureaucracies indicates that there remains a number of conditions in these organizations that affect (adversely, in my opinion) the exhibition of positive ethical behavior on the part of those individuals laboring within them. In the early 1980s Robert Jackall undertook in depth case studies of three large American for-profit corporations. In the course of his research, Jackall conducted over 180 interview's with corporate executives in an effort to uncover the social context of their work. His resulting report, Moral Mazes: The World of Corporate Managers (Jackall, 1988), is a worthy successor to The Organization Man and provides a rich resource for answering this question. Accordingly I have shaped this portion of the paper around some of Jackall's primary findings about organizational life. Here are some of the concerns expressed by Jackall in his book: 1. Corporations are persons only in a legal sense. Under the law, corporations have rights, privileges, and obligations as "persons." However, corporations are not human beings, and one should be very circum spect in attributing to them anthropomorphic char acteristics. It may be useful at times to speak of corporations as having such traits as loyalty, honesty, character, ethicality, concern for stakeholders, and similar attributes, but it must always be remembered that the corporation exists only on paper under the rule of law (Cragg, 2002, p. 126). Says Friedman (1970), "What does it mean to say that 'business' has responsibilities? Only people can have responsibili ties" (p. 32). While it may be true that individuals within the corporate structure possess these human character traits, one should never make the assump tion that a corporate entity has a conscience or a soul. JackaU (1988) speaks of a public relations ploy known as the "corporate persona, a kind of fictive reality, known coUoquiaUy in the field as a 'front'" (p. 174). One must always look beyond "the front" to under stand what truly is happening within the organization. 2. Business organizations are typically established to make a profit, and this can affect their moral culture. On occasion businesses are created for purposes other than making a profit (such as tax shelters), but most proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations are in business to make a profit. In fact, leaders of for-profit corporations have a fiduciary obligation to increase the value of the money invested in the corporation by its shareholders (Cragg, 2002, p. 125). Compe tition is fierce in today's global marketplace, so making a profit year after year is no easy matter. The need to make a profit puts considerable pressure on business managers, and leads to many temptations to "cut corners" ethicaUy (Sauser, in press a). In fact, this profit drive can create within the minds of business leaders a type of situational ethic described by JackaU (1988) as foUows: Notions of morality that one might hold and indeed practice outside the workplace ? say some variant of Judeo-Christian ethics ? become irrelevant, as do less SpecificaUy religious points of principle, unless they mesh with organizational ideologies. Under certain conditions, such notions may even become danger ous. .. Managers know that in the organization right and wrong get decided by those with enough clout to make their views stick, (p. 105.) In the words of one of JackaU's interviewees, "What is right in the corporation is not what is right in a man's home or his church. What is right is what the</page><page sequence="7">Ethics in Business 351 guy above you wants from you. That's what morality is in the corporation" (p. 109). Jackall sums up this problem concisely: "Strong convictions of any sort are suspect" (p. 50). In for-profit organizations "the bottom line" is a quick and handy measure of corporate success, and short-term unit profitability is often the key to a manager's success as well. A manager who is seeking to "get ahead at all costs" might be tempted to cut ethical corners in order to gain a reputation as someone who can make money for the organization. This temptation may prove overpowering in an organizational culture where "the guy above you" issues such demands as these: "I don't care how you do it, just get it done!" "Don't ever bring me bad news!" "Don't bother me with the details; you know what to do." "Remember, we always meet our financial goals somehow." "No one gets injured on this worksite.. .period. Understand?" "Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies." (Sauser, in press a.) When a manager asks an employee, "Can't you find some way to make this happen?" there is almost an implicit message to "cut ethical corners" if one must in order to meet the desired goal or outcome. 3. Most large business corporations are organized as bureaucracies; this tends to distribute authority in ways that may be counterproductive. In Jackall's (1988) blunt words, "It is characteristic of this authority system that details are pushed down and credit is pulled up. Superiors do not like to give detailed instructions to subordinates" (p. 20). This can result in considerable role ambiguity on the part of employees of the firm. What precisely is to be done, by whom, using what procedures? In ambiguous circumstances like these, moral behavior can become compromised, especially given the organizational culture issues discussed above. This can lead to what Jackall describes as a related problem, avoidance of responsibility: "As a result, many managers become extremely adept at sidestepping decisions altogether and shrugging off responsibility.. .leaving those who actually do decide to carry the ball alone in the open field" (p. 80). For these reasons, Jackall refers to bureaucratic businesses as "vast systems of organized irresponsibility" (p. 95). 4. Business managers, particularly those at the middle levels and below, have little control over their own time. JackaU (1988) notes that this lack of economy over one's time results from "continual interruption from one's subordinates, telephone caUs from customers and clients, and necessary meetings with coUeagues" (p. 20). (I hasten to add that there are too many "unnecessary" meetings as weU!) As a consequence of this time pressure, many managers do not have the luxury to ponder their decisions and actions in terms of ethicality. They often go with their "gut re sponse," and in a milieu of ethical relativism, they sometimes make decisions which, upon reflection, they recognize as moraUy insufficient. 5. Many corporate managers have a very short-term time perspective. This is true because managers are typicaUy rewarded for short-term financial gains; the "quar terly report" is their major measure of performance. JackaU (1988) attributes this short-term perspective in part to the training many managers receive: The training of professional managers increasingly fo cuses... on the techniques of financial wizardry?for example, leveraged buyouts, arbitrage, stock protec tion and stock kiting?and on quantitative measures of organizational progress... Many of these tools reflect and iUustrate the short-term mentality that character izes most managerial training... Similarly, accounting systems that place a premium on bare-bones inventory reflect the same pressure for short-run profit maxi mization, (p. 82.) JackaU (1988, p. 83) also credits the structure and pace of managerial work itself for creating a short-term perspective. This short-term perspective ? coupled with the facts that (a) managerial perfor mance is "always subject to a myriad of interpreta tions" (p. 62) and (b) bureaucracy blurs individual authority and responsibility (as noted above) - can lead to managerial decisions that are not always in the best interests of the firm, such as "starving a plant" or "milking a plant" (JackaU, 1988, p. 91). Such a strategy may improve one's chances for up ward mobility within the firm while simultaneously eroding the organization's competitiveness in the long run. JackaU describes the plight of too many managers as foUows: "Managerial effectiveness and others' perceptions of one's leadership depend on</page><page sequence="8">352 William I. Sauser, Jr. the willingness to battle for the prestige that comes from dominance and to make whatever moral accommodations such struggles demand" (p. 196). 6. Problems of psychological distance and multiple stakeholders also diffuse responsibility within the bureau cratic business firm. Issues of stakeholder satisfaction are explored in depth by such writers as Carson (2003), Cragg (2002), and Phillips (2003a, b) and will not be elaborated upon in this paper. Suffice it to say here that multiple stakeholders complicate the job of the corporate manager: Managers must address a multiplicity of audiences, some of whom are considered rivals, and some out right adversaries. These audiences are the internal corporate hierarchy with its intricate and shifting power cliques and competing managerial circles, key regulators, local and federal legislators, special publics that vary according to the issues, and the public at large, whose goodwill and favorable opinions are considered essential for a company's free operation. Qackall, 1988, p. 156.) The key stakeholders to please, of course, are the owners of the corporation - the stockholders. But more and more frequently these persons are dis tanced considerably from the operations of the firm for reasons Jackall (1988) explains as follows: The capital markets are increasingly dominated by big institutional investors?among them, large corpora tions, the insurance companies, the investment funds, and the brokerage houses?whose "quick in, quick out" philosophy wreaks havoc with corporate stocks, (p. 83.) May (1995) concurs with this point: Stockholders are important stakeholders in a company, but by no means the only ones. Workers, customers, neighbors, and the public at large have in varying way a stake in its performance, sometimes indeed a larger stake than stockholders who may dart in and out of their investments more readily than workers and neighbors can disengage themselves from a company and its fortunes, (p. 696.) In addition to increasing stockholder detachment from the companies they own, there is also the problem within some organizations of a growing psychological distance between corporate leaders and their "rank-and-file" employees. "Bureaucracies create many mechanisms that separate men and women from the consequences of their actions," comments JackaU (1988). "Impersonality provides the psychological distance necessary to make what managers caU 'hard choices'" (p. 127). Unfortu nately, this psychological distance, coupled with stockholder detachment, can also result in decisions which devastate the lives of many corporate employees. JackaU acknowledges the stress which results from "periods of organizational upheaval, a regular feature of American business where mergers, buyouts, divestitures, and especiaUy 'organizational restructuring' have become commonplace occur rences" (p. 24). These six complex organizational features ex plored by JackaU (1988) ? and others too numerous to describe here ? have led to a prevaiUng organi zational culture in many business organizations where, according to JackaU, "one must learn to streamline oneself shamelessly, learn to wear aU the right masks, learn aU the proper vocabularies of discourse, get to know aU the right people, and cultivate the subtleties of the art of self-promotion" (p. 74). Such an organizational culture hardly leads to the promotion of moraUty and ethicality! This is why creating an ethical culture within the workplace is one of the most important tasks of the modern manager (Sauser, in press b). Joseph (2003), in the executive summary of the National Business Ethics Survey 2003, describes some of the results from weak organizational cultures where ethics is not properly emphasized, modeled, and rewarded. Here are just a few of his findings: Nearly a third of respondents say their coworkers condone questionable ethics prac tices by showing respect for those who achieve success using them. The types of misconduct most frequently observed in 2003 include: abusive or intimi dating behavior (21%), misreporting hours worked (20%), lying (19%), and withholding needed information (18%). Employees in transitioning organizations (undergoing mergers, acquisitions or restruc turings) observe misconduct and feel pressure at rates that are nearly double those in more stable organizations.</page><page sequence="9">Ethics in Business 353 Despite an overall increase in reporting of misconduct, nearly half of all non-management employees (44%) still do not report the mis conduct they observe. The top two reasons given for not reporting misconduct are: (1) a belief that no corrective action will be taken and (2) fear that the report will not be kept confi dential. Less than three in five employees (58%) who report misconduct are satisfied with the re sponse of their organizations, (pp. ii-iii.) Changing an established organizational culture is a very difficult process requiring time, effort, and energy on the part of both managers and employees (Hellriegel and Slocum, 2004). How might enlightened managers change a corporate culture to promote rather than inhibit moral behavior in a socially responsible manner? Attention is now fo cused on the beginnings of an answer to this crucial question. Creating an ethical organizational culture How might a leader in business go about creating an organizational culture where ethics can flourish? The Ethics Resource Center (Joseph, 2003, p. 5) offers four elements as a beginning point: written standards of ethical conduct; training on standards of conduct; an ethics office or telephone advice line; and a means to report misconduct anonymously. Here are some suggestions shared recently at a conference for South African entrepreneurs (Sauser, in press b): 1. Adopt a code of ethics. The code need not be long and elaborate with flowery words and phrases. In fact, the best ethical codes are stated simply in lan guage anyone can understand. A good way to pro duce such a code is to ask all employees of the firm (or a representative group of them) to participate in its creation (Kuchar, 2003). Identify the commonly held moral beliefs and values of the members of the firm and codify them into a written document which all can understand and support. Post the code of ethics in prominent places around the worksite. Make certain that all employees subscribe to it. 2. Provide ethics training. From time to time the ethical business leader should conduct ethics training sessions. These may be led by experts in business ethics, or they may be informal in nature and led by the manager and/or employees themselves. A highly effective way to conduct an ethics training session is to provide "what if..." cases for discussion and resolution. The leader presents a real world scenario in which an ethical d?emma is encountered. Using the organization's code of ethics as a guide, partici pants then explore options and seek a consensus ethical solution. This kind of training sharpens the written ethical code and brings it to Ufe. 3. Hire and promote ethical people. This, in concert with step four below, is probably the best defense against putting the business at risk through ethical lapses made by employees with character flaws. When making human resources decisions it is critical to reward ethical behavior and punish unethical behavior. Investigate the character of the people you hire, and do your best to hire people who have exhibited high moral standards in the past. Base promotional decisions on matters of character in addition to matters of technical competence. Dem onstrate to your employees that high ethical stan dards are a requirement for advancement in the firm. 4. Correct unethical behavior. This is the comple ment of step three. When the organization's ethical code is breached, the employee(s) responsible must be punished. Many business organizations use "progressive discipline," with an oral warning (in tended to advise the employee of what is and is not acceptable behavior) used as the first step, foUowed by a written reprimand, suspension without pay, and termination as further disciplinary action if unethical behavior persists. Of course, some ethical lapses are so egregious that they require suspension ? or even termination - foUowing the first offense. Through consistent and firm application of sanctions to cor rect unethical behavior, the manager w?l signal to aU employees that substandard moral behavior w?l not be tolerated. 5. Take a proactive strategy. Businesses that wish to estabUsh a reputation for ethicaUty and good corporate citizenship in the community wiU often organize and support programs intended to "give something back" to the community. Programs that promote continuing education, wholesome recreation, good health and hygiene, nutritious diet, environmental quality, ade quate housing, and other community benefits may be undertaken in an effort to demonstrate the extent to which the business promotes care and concern for</page><page sequence="10">354 William I. Sauser, Jr. human welfare. Seeking out and adopting "best practices" from other businesses in the community is also a proactive strategy. 6. Conduct a social audit. Most businesses are familiar with the process of financial audits. This concept can be employed in the context of ethics and corporate responsibility as well. From time to time the business might invite responsible parties to examine the organization's product design, pur chasing, production, marketing, distribution, cus tomer relations, and human resources functions as well, with an eye toward identifying and correcting any areas of policy or practice that raise ethical concerns. Similarly, programs of corporate respon sibility (such as those mentioned in step 5) should be reviewed for effectiveness and improved as needed. 7. Protect whistle blowers. A "whistle blower" is a person within the firm who points out ethically questionable actions taken by other employees ? or even by managers ? within the organization. (The term is borrowed from the athletic arena, where referees "blow the whistle" when a foul is com mitted.) Too often corporate whistle blowers are ignored ? or even punished - by those who receive the unfortunate news of wrongdoing within the business. All this does is discourage revelation of ethical problems. Instead the whistle blower should be protected, and even honored. When unethical actions are uncovered within a firm by one of its own employees, that is the time for managers to step forward and take corrective action (as described in step 4 above). Employees observe one another's actions and learn from one another's consequences. If the owners and managers of a business turn a blind eye toward wrongdoing, a signal is sent to everyone within the firm that ethicality is not characteristic of that organization's culture. A downward spiral of moral behavior is likely to follow. 8. Empower the guardians of integrity. The business leader's chief task with respect to establishing a culture of ethicality is to lead by example and to empower every member of the organization to take personal action that demonstrates the firm's commitment to ethics in its relationships with suppliers, customers, employees, and shareholders. Turn each employee of the firm, no matter what that individual's position in the organizational hierarchy, into a guardian of the firm's integrity. When maliciousness and indifference are replaced with a culture of integrity, honesty, and ethicality, the business wiU reap long-term benefits from aU quarters. Demonstrating corporate social responsibility As noted earlier, there are many different viewpoints on the meaning of the term "corporate social responsibility," and thus different strategies for meeting this goal. Friedman's (1970) admonition to attend solely to making a profit for the shareholders within the law would likely be labeled as a defensive or accommodative strategy using Schermerhorn's (2005) typology. Stakeholder theorists typicaUy recommend an accommodative or even proactive strategy. Desjardins (2003), for example, suggests that ethical businesses "produce a high quality product that consumers value, treat employees with decency and fairness, [and] give back to the com munity that supports your business" (p. xiii). Novak (1996) provides a very comprehensive definition of "business ethics" from the proactive point of view: Business ethics means a great deal more than obeying the civ? law and not violating the moral law. It means imagining and creating a new sort of world based on the principles of individual creativity, community, realism, and the other virtues of enterprise. It means respecting the right of the poor to their own personal economic initiative and their own creativity. It means fashioning a culture worthy of free women and free men?to the benefit of the poor and to the greater glory of God. (p. 133) To iUustrate his proactive definition of business ethics, Novak (1996) lists what he believes to be seven internal and seven external responsibilities of ethical firms. Respectively, they are: Seven Internal Responsibilities 1. To satisfy customers with goods and services of real value. 2. To make a reasonable return on the funds en trusted to the business corporation by its investors. 3. To create new wealth. 4. To create new jobs.</page><page sequence="11">Ethics in Business 355 5. To defeat envy through generating upward mobility and putting empirical ground under the conviction that hard work and talent are fairly rewarded. 6. To promote invention, ingenuity, and in gen eral "progress in the arts and useful sciences" (Article I, Section 8, U. S. Constitution). 7. To diversify the interests of the republic. Seven Responsibilities from Outside Business 1. To establish within the firm a sense of com munity and respect for the dignity of persons. 2. To protect the political soil of liberty. 3. To exemplify respect for law. 4. To make manifest social justice. 5. To communicate often and fully with their investors, shareholders, pensioners, customers, and employees. 6. To contribute to making its own habitat, the surrounding society, a better place. 7. To protect the moral ecology of freedom, (pp. 134-159.) Discussing each one of these responsibilities in full is beyond the scope of this paper; interested readers are encouraged to study carefully Novak's excellent book and to review Holland's (2002) suggestions for taking responsible corporate actions. Here let me simply provide one more quotation from Novak (1996), a statement which captures the essence of the proactive approach to business ethics I am encour aging in this paper: The business corporation is in its essence a moral institution. It imposes some moral obligations that are inherent in its own ends, structure, and modes of operation. Other moral obligations fall upon it through the moral and religious commitments of its members. Thus, those who labor within the business corporation have many moral responsibilities and a richly various moral agenda, of which the fourteen responsibilities mentioned here are basic but not exhaustive, (pp. 158-159.) I submit that any business leader who embraces Novak's vision of the business corporation as a moral institution, and who takes the necessary actions to create an ethical culture within her or his organi zation, is making a truly significant contribution to society. There is yet one more step that can be taken by one pursuing such a caUing: providing servant leadership. This ultimate step is the final topic of this paper. Providing servant leadership Magoni (2002/03) describes a new paradigm for leadership, a paradigm which is gaining the atten tion of theologians, business leaders, and educators alike: In leadership literature, two paradigms we often read about are the pyramid and the inverted pyramid. The pyramid model represents the old school, m?itaristic, top-down, hierarchical leadership style. The CEO is at the top, and aU policy and ideas flow from the top down. In the inverted pyramid, the leader or CEO is seen on the bottom, serving the organization. He or she is there to serve the company and remove aU of the obstacles that would prevent the team from getting the job done. This paradigm is often used when describing servant leadership, (p. 14.) The late Robert Greenleaf, founder of the Greenleaf Center for Servant Leadership, is often credited with coining the term, "servant leader ship." Autry (2002/2003) summarizes six ideas about servant leadership made popular by Greenleaf and his disciples: 1. Leadership is not about controUing people; it's about caring for people and being a useful re source for people. 2. Leadership is not about being a boss; it's about being present for people and building a com munity at work. 3. Leadership is not about holding on to territory; it's about letting go of ego, bringing your spirit to work, being your best and most authentic self. 4. Leadership is less concerned with pep talks and more concerned with creating a place in which people can do good work, can find meaning in their work, and bring their spirits to work. 5. Leadership, like life, is largely a matter of pay ing attention. 6. Leadership requires love. (p. 5.)</page><page sequence="12">356 William I. Sauser, Jr. This final statement about leadership made by Autry is very similar to the highest ethic identified by Baelz (1977): love. Says Baelz: Man's essential nature.. .is in accordance with love. In acting out of love men are being true to what they really are. Love is not only a force in human nature, it is the source and spring of personal well-being. Those who love.. .are acting as 'real' persons; in responding to the nature with which and for which they have been created they have already discovered what it is to 'come alive', (p. 108.) Servant leadership, then, can be seen as the appli cation of the ethic of love to the management of the work enterprise. Here are ten characteristics of the servant leader as envisioned by Greenleaf (2002/ 2003): listening, empathy, healing, awareness, per suasion, conceptualization, foresight, stewardship, commitment to the growth of people, and building community. What might the world of business be like if every manager strove to be a servant leader? The concept of servant leadership is beginning to move into the mainstream literature for business education. For example, Ken Blanchard, co-author of The One Minute Manager (Blanchard and Johnson, 1982), has recently collaborated with Phil Hodges to produce The Servant Leader: Transforming Your Heart, Head, Hands, and Habits (Blanchard and Hodges, 2003). James Autry, former president of the maga zine group for Meredith Corporation, has also re cently published a guide for corporate managers who desire to incorporate the ideals of servant leadership into their organizational culture (Autry, 2001). Here is a closing thought. How much better off would be the world of work if the type of business culture described by Jackall in Moral Mazes were replaced by one that emphasizes ethicality, corporate social responsibiUty, and servant leadership? King (2002/2003) formulates this question into a chal lenge for today's leaders of commerce and industry: We as a nation have been so enamored by [the] hero-leader that we have placed immense power and wealth in the hands of these executives and many have squandered the trust placed in them. Corpo rations have collapsed and filed for bankruptcy as a result of unethical actions and self-serving leadership practices. These leaders who have reaped more harm than good in their actions have directly affected our nation's economy and quality of Ufe. The corporate community is struggUng to find leaders committed to the mission and the margin, people and profit, organizational growth and fam?y stability. Leaders with ethical perspectives that are able to gain the trust of the employees, the customers and the community are now in great demand. Structures and organizations are looking for leaders who care for people, rather than... control people, individuals concerned about bu?ding community more than being boss, leaders who empower people rather than use people, (p. 18.)
