<plain_text><page sequence="1">Before Olympos, a study of the aniconic origins of Poseidon, Hermes and Eros, by ELMER G. SUHR. New York: Helios Books 1967. Pp.175; 56 figs. $5.95. THIS VOLUME, intended as the first of a triad entitled The column of the cosmos, is in serious need of a conclusion, with or without its sequels. The interpretations which Suhr makes are con- tinuously interrupted by an assortment of world- wide evidence from art, literature, music, dance and ritual. The placing of all the plates in the center of the volume makes following the author's arguments even more confusing, if not exasperat- ing. After making my way through the labyrinth of assembled interpretations and evidence, I hesi- tatingly suggest the main points made by Suhr: (1) at least four divinities, Poseidon, Hermes, Aphrodite, and Eros, were worshipped in aniconic form in pre-Greek times, were grounded in con- temporary theories about astronomy and meteor- ology, and probably acquired anthropomorphic features among the Greeks; (2) many attributes of these deities and many artistic and architectural creations were related to the "column of the cosmos" or to its characteristics, significance, or related objects; so the caduceus of Hermes, the bull, the horse, the tortoise, the bird, sphinxes, griffins, lions, the spindle, the scepter, the magic rod, the snake, the eye, caryatids, the double axe, wings, the conical hat, music; (3) the "column of the cosmos" itself represented the fertility of the earth at one end and the sun, as the dispenser of pneuma, at the other; between the extremities passed various elements, moving upward or down- ward in constantly spiraling motion; (4) Posei- don's aniconic origin was the wind, Hermes' the bestowing of fertility from above down to earth, Aphrodite's the whirling vortex of creation, Eros' the phenomenon of the sun; of the four, Hermes occupied the most important position, being "pre- eminently a god of communication from the upper regions of the heavens to the surface and interior of the earth." Additional interpretations which may be clas- sified as eyebrow raisers include these: the bronze Marathon Boy is a statue of Eros holding an alabastrotheke; the popularity of the bull resulted from its symbolizing the power of the wind "gen- erated around the whirling sun and in other areas"; Odysseus was a moon hero who had much in common with Hermes; the emperor of China became the human embodiment of the cosmic column; the yin-yang symbol mirrors the ascend- ing and descending movements of the cosmic column; the cosmic column was bisexual; and Eros, "certainly the visible effect of the sun's power and light," had the aniconical form of the whirling meteor or comet. Considering the im- portance of the sun in Professor Suhr's scheme of things, it is appropriate that his work is being printed by the Helios Book Publishing Company. Whether the interpretations will find wide- spread support among scholars may be open to question; at least, he does offer an explanation for some heretofore unexplained phenomena, such as the column and eye engraved on the gold ring recently found in the royal tomb near Arkhanes,</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL 371 Crete. Perhaps defenders and detractors of this volume will bring us closer to some of the an- cient religious beliefs and their survival into more sophisticated times and places. ROBERT E.
