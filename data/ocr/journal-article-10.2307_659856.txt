CHAMBERLAIN [NOTE. - Authors, especially those whose articles appear in journals and other serials not entirely devoted to anthropology, will greatly aid this department of the American Anthropologist by sending directly to Dr A. F. Chamberlain, Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts, U. S. A., reprints or copies of such studies as they may desire to have PNticed in these pages. - EDITOR.] GENERAL Austin (0. P.) Queer methods of travel in curious corners of the world. (Nat. Geogr. Mag., Wash., 1907, xvIII, 687- 715, 7 pl., 21 fgs.) Treats briefly of S. American burro, Delhi camel-wagons, Egyptian wedding procession, Belgian dog milk-wagon, raft of inflated bullock- skins in India, Indian bullock-wagon, Indian " ekka," Hyderabad elephant conveyances, Calcutta palanquin, Indian "push-push," Ceylonese bamboo-covered carts, Carabaos threshing rice in Philip- pines, Tagalog boys carrying vegetables, Filipinos carrying water in bamboo tubes, Filipinos carrying milk, vehicles in Shang- hai, Hongkong, and Yokohama, one-rope (rawhide) bridge across Thelmu river (Uri, India), Madeira ox-sleds, Austra- lian automobile train, etc. Bell (A. G.) A few thoughts concerning eugenics. (Ibid., 119-23.) Dr B. argues that in the case of consanguineous marriages " we do not know conclusively whether consanguinity in the parents produces the defective condition, or whether it simply intensifies a preexisting tendency in the family "; that the impor- tance of the inferior is overrated, "an increase in the superior element seems to be a more important factor in producing improvement than a decrease in the in- ferior element "; that fellowships should be granted on the condition of marriage rather than celibacy; that legislative re- strictions on marriage are unwise. The key to the problem is prepotency. Children of the world. (Ibid., 126-40, 15 pl.) Interesting pictures of Danish, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Burmese, Hindu, Hawaiian, Ceylonese, Javanese, Jamaican Negro, Moki, Congo Negro, Egyptian boys and girls, school-children, etc.; also Chinese infant coolies. Giuffrida-Ruggeri (V.) L'antropologia e le arti belle. (Riv. d'Italia, Roma, 1907, x, 2, 900-17.) Treats of anthro- pology in relation to the fine arts. Views of Duhousset, Richer, Thomson, etc., the theories of the Greeks and Romans and of the medieval artists, are discussed, the representation of the male and female forms in particular. Michel Angelo fol- lowed the Romans rather than the Greeks and went away from nature, in some ways, in his figures of women, e. g., in the matter of the breasts. Ac- cording to G.-R., "artistic anatomy ought rather to be called anthropology applied to the fine arts." Gu6bhard (A.) Camps et enceintes. (Congr. Prehist. de France, IIIe Sess., Autun, 1907 [90o8], 997-1036, 121 fgs.) Treats, with ample bibliographic references, of "camps" and enclosures of all sorts, ancient and modern, in all parts of the world, their origin, develop- ment, etc.,- the need of defence was born with that of life in the open air. Cyclopean masonry was succeeded by more complicated architecture in the bronze and iron ages. Prehistoric works, Celtic "Iforts" and duns, Italian castel- lieri, Portuguese citanias, Scandinavian bygdeborge, Balearic talayots, Sardinian nuraghe, German Ringwdiille, Rhodesian kraal-ruins, American Indian mounds, Russian maidans and kurgans, Gallic and Roman walls, etc., are considered. The illustrations are good. Koch (W.) and Mann (S. A.) A com- parison of the chemical composition of three human brains at different ages. (Proc. Physiol. Soc., Cambridge, 1907, xxxvi-xxxviii.) Gives results of exam- ination of brains of a 6-weeks and a 2- year-old girl and -a 19-year-old youth, showing that with the growth of the brain go "1a decrease in moisture, pro- 470</page><page sequence="4">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 471 teins, extractives, and ash, a change usually found in growing tissues," and "an increase in cerebrins, lipoid sul- phur, and cholesterin." Lasch (R.) Die Arbeitsweise der Natur- v6lker. (Z. f. Socialw., Leipzig, 19o8, xI, Sndabr., 1-12.) Treats of primary and secondary divisions of labor (hunt- ing, fishing, housebuilding, cattle-breed- ing are originally male occupations ; cul- tivation of food-plants, etc., spinning and weaving, pottery, etc., are inven- tions and arts of woman ; metallurgy be- longs to men); individual and cooper- ative labor (the latter appears often in low forms in the hunt, agriculture, etc., - preparation of the soil for plant- ing, the making of fire, and the working of the metals have been much dependent upon it ); division of labor properly so- called (Borneo, sewing of coats by women, but cutting out of figures to be used on them as ornaments done by men; Kafirs, men make clay tobacco- pipes, women pottery in general) ; call- ing and profession (operate to cause di- visions of labor). In primitive labor there is less monotony and poverty than, is generally thought. Lovejoy (A. O.) The fundamental con- cept of the primitive philosophy. (Mo- nist, Chicago, 1907, xvI, 357-82.) Treats of words among "three typical savage races, - the North Americans, the races of Oceania, and the Bantu," which "express the general concept of a universal, impersonal, communicable energy," and "are the most important words in the religious vocabularies of the peoples in question, being commonly, but erroneously, taken, by those who have written of those peoples, to mean ' god' or 'spirit.' " Their existence moreover "establishes the existence in the savage mind of the rather abstract idea under consideration " and "throws a good deal of light upon the connota- tion and correlations of that idea and its place in primitive thought." Such words are the Dakotan (Siouan) wakanda, Algonkian manitou, Iroquoian oki; Mel- anesian mana, Polynesian atua, Mala- gasy andriamnanitra ; Bantu mulungu; Masai ngai. This idea, according to L., lies at the bottom of very many religious ceremonies, practices, taboos, cults, rites, etc. Recent writers are criticized (e. g., Brinton, Frazer) for paying too little attention to this idea, for which the author proposes the term manitouism. He seems to have missed altogether Hewitt's discussion of orenda in the American Anthropologist, 1902, N. s. IV, 32-46. Lowie ( R. H.) Catch-words for mytho- logical motives. (J. Amer. Folk-lore, Boston, 19o8, xxI, 24-27. ) Lists of 29 catch-words in general use and 32 others now proposed. Manouvrier (L.) Memoire visuelle. Vis- ualisationcolor6e. Calculmental. Notes et etude sur le cas de Mlle Diamandi. (R. tc. d'Anthr. d. Paris, 19o8, xvIII, 73-88, 2 fgs.) Gives results of investi- gations on Miss U. Diamandi, sister of the calculator P. Diamandi, as to visual memory (number-scheme, month and week-schemes), colored vision (numbers 1-9, letters of alphabet, names of days of week, names of persons), mental calcu- lation, etc. M. is of opinion that "any intelligent young person with a good visual memory can become, with appro- priate cultivation, a mental calculator like Mlle Diamandi." Mantegazza (P.) Che cosa il genio ? (A. p. l'Anthrop., Firenze, 1907, XXXVII, 391-8.) Criticizes A. Pado- van's recent works Ifigli della gloria, Le creature sovrane, L'uomo di genio comepoeta-Che cosa eilgenio ? (Milano, 1905) and his definition of genius, "a physiological condition of exquisite ex- ceptional nervous sensibility." Accord- ing to M. "the idea contained in the word genius is solely and uniquely em- pirical." Mochi (A.) L'indice di curvatura del frontale. (Ibid., 439-45.) Gives results of investigations of the index of the curve of the frontal bone in skulls of 15 adult Italian males and 15 females, 5 children, 2 fetuses, 5 male and 5 female African negroes, 5 male and 5 female Australians, 10 male and 6 female Fuegians, 5 de- formed Peruvians, 2 hydrocephals, a microcephal, the skull of Neandertal and that of the Pithecanthropus. As having prominent foreheads (index below 87) are reckoned the hydrocephals, fetuses, African negro women and Italian chil- dren; as medium (index 87-90) Italian women, African negroes, Italian men; as having retreating foreheads (index above 90o) Australian women and men, Fuegian women and men, deformed Peruvians, microcephals, Neandertal man and Pithecanthropus. M. is of opinion that the sexual and racial variations of the frontal region are due more to the de-</page><page sequence="5">472 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 10, 1908 gree of convexity of the curve and the differences of height than to diverse bilat- eral or longitudinal development of the os frontis. Nuova (La) convenzione internazionale per l'unificazione delle misure craniome- triche e cefalometriche. (Ibid., 325-335- ) Lists and describes the cranial, mandibu- lar, and cephalometric measurements recommendedin the agreement at Monaco (I906) and approved by the Italian An- thropological Society at its meeting of Nov. 27, 1907. Schmidt (G.) L'origine de l'Id6e de Dieu. Etude historico-critique et posi- tive. (Anthropos, Wien, 19o8, III, 125- 62, 336-68.) First two sections of a comprehensive discussion of the origin of the idea of God- philological period in first half of 19th century (Miiller, etc.), ethnologic period last quarter of 19th century (Lubbock, Spencer, Tylor, Lang, Keane, Frazer, Jevons ; Brinton ; Chan- tapie de la Saussaye ; Marillier, Reinach ; Bastian, Schultze, Ehrenreich, Frobe- nius; reaction against animism; "pan- Babylonianism," Winckler, etc.), theo- logical position (apologists and philoso- phers, exegetes - defects of position). Schrader (F.) Oceans et humanit6. (R. Ec. d'Anthr. de Paris, 19o8, xvIII, 33- 45. ) Treats of the oceans as influencing human culture, etc. For thousands of years the sea was the Mediterranean (with part of the Red sea and Persian gulf). The absence of tides of any con- sequence on the shores of the Mediter- ranean led to the intimate relations with land and sea of the ancient Greeks, their art, etc. Stolyhwo (M.) Description d'un nouvel ost6ophore. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Bruxelles, 1908, xxvII, extr., I-2, I pl.) Brief description of a new osteophore, permitting the tracing of horizontal dia- grams and also such orientation of the skull as to enable the tracing of transverse and sagittal diagrams. It can be used also for long-bones, etc. Super (C. W.) The archeology of lan- guage. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 19o8, xxx, 10-23.) Discusses attempts to discover "the primitive language" in ancient times (Psammeticus, ideas of Lucretius, etc.) and later (Frederick II of Germany, one of the Great Moguls of India, James IV of Scotland, etc.), the question why does man speak, grammar and speech, dialects, " original'" lan- guages of children (data of Hale), etc. S. thinks these children are "cases of atavism of a particular kind such as are now and then seen in the domain of biology." They help solve the problem of the origin of speech. EUROPE Beddoe (J.) On a series of skulls, col- lected by John E. Pritchard, Esq., F.S.A. from a Carmelite burying-ground in Bris- tol. (J. R. Anthrop. Inst., Lond., 1907, XXXVII, 215-219, I pl.) Gives details of measurements of II medieval skulls from the Carmelite burying-ground (the Friary was founded about 1270 A. D. ) in the city of Bristol (indices range from 72 to 84). The modern Bristol people are more dolichocephalic. Dr B. is of opinion that the growing type among the English proletariat is a dark long-headed type, and that conjugal selec- tion plays an important part in changes of type. Bliimml (E. K.) Drei Primizlieder aus Tirol. (Z. d. Ver. f. Volksk., Berlin, 1908, xvIII, 88-90.) Texts of three " first mass " songs. The folk treat the first mass of a young priest as his wed- ding celebration. Bolte (J.) Der Schwank von der faulen Frau und der Katze. (Ibid., 53-60.) Gives text of two poems (one by J6rg Zobel, written ca. 1455-1456), the other by Mysner, a strolling singer of the mid- dle of the 15th century), treating the theme of the " lazy woman," etc. - Zum deutschen Volksliede. (Ibid., 76-88.) Texts of 5 German folk-songs (two relating to Batavia in Java) and 6 Hessian songs collected by the brothers Grimm. - Die Sage von dem unbewusst iiber- schrittenen See. (Ibid., 91.) Notes on legends connected with Lakes Ziirich and Laach (also one from Valais) that may have been served as basis for G. Schwab's poem (1826) " Der Reiter und der Bodensee." - Ein Weihnachtspiel aus dem Salz- Kammergute. (Ibid., 129-50.) Gives dialect text and music of a Christmas play in 9 scenes, written down by Franz Tschischka (1786-1855) in Vienna, given by him in 1853 to Karl Weinhold and found among his MSS. Relations to several plays of the I6th century are evi- dent from the text. Briickner (A.) Neuere Arbeiten zur sla- wischen Volkskunde. Polnisch und B6hmisch. (Ibid., 203-14.)

Sobriquets bas valaisans. (Schw. Arch. f. Volksk., Basel, 19o8, xII, 59-62.) Some 30 examples of local nick-names (blason pofulaire) from the districts of Entremont, Anniviers, Sion, St Maurice, Monthey, in the lower Valais, with explanatory notes. Daucourt (A.) Nol1s jurassiens. (Ibid., 124-34.) Gives texts of 9 noiFls of the 18th century from the Jura country. These songs go back to the old mystery- plays of the Middle Ages and survived after the ban of the Church had been laid upon them. In the pre-Noil fes- tivities figured the tronche de NA, a great piece of pine burned in thefoenta or little excavation in the wall. Songs were sung while the fire burned. Dettling (A.) Die Hirsmontagfeier im Kapuzinerkloster zu Arth 1765-1766. (Ibid., 81-91.) Treats of the celebra- tion of "Hirsmontag" in 1765-66 at the Capuchin cloister of Arth in the canton of Schwyz, with the text of play, etc. Falls (De W. C. ) Saint Stephen's fkte in Budapest. (Nat. Geogr. Mag., Wash., I907, xvIII, 549-58, 4 pl.) Describes the festival procession (2oth August) in honor of St Stephen (d. Io36), the patron saint of Hungary, the costumes of peasants and nobles, etc. Favraud (A.) La station mousterienne du Petit-Puymoyen, commune de Puy- moyen, Charente. (R. Ec. d'Anthr. de Paris, 19o8, xvIII, 46-66, 20 fgs.) De- scribes the Mousterian " station" of Petit-Puymoyend iscovered in Dec. 1906. Stratigraphy, fauna (reindeer, horse, bovida, wolf, dog, etc.), stone tools (strikers, bolas, pierres. de jet, discs, scrapers of several sorts, etc.), imple- ments of horn and bone (flakers, etc.), human jaws (two pieces), teeth, etc. These human remains, according to F., strengthen the belief that "the human race peopling Europe at the close of the old paleolithic and at the beginning of the later paleolithic was a race analogous to the Negroes and the Australians of today." See Siflre. Frazer (J. G. ) St George and the Parilia. (R. d. Et. Ethnogr. et Sociol., Paris, 1908, I, 1-15.) Argues that "the Fes- tival of St George at the present day, like the Parilia [great shepherds' festival] of ancient Italy, is a ceremony intended to guard the cattle against their real and their imaginary foes, the wolves and the witches, at the critical season when the flocks and herds are driven out to pasture for the first time in spring." Reprinted from the third edition of the author's Golden Bough. Fiirst (C. M.) Arkebiskop Andreas Sun- esson, en antropologisk studie. (Ymer, Stckhlm., 19o8, xxvII, 69-82, 2 fgs.) Anthropometric and other data of the skeleton and skull of Andreas Sunesson (d. 1228), in 12o01 archbishop of Lund and primate of Sweden. The cephalic index was 69.9, approximate capacity 1,301 ccm., stature (calculated from long-bones) 172 cm. The archbishop was thus a typical north Teuton. The data are from MS. of A. H. Florman made in 1833 when the grave was opened. Gray (J.) Memoir on the pigmentation survey of Scotland. (J. R. Anthrop. Inst., Lond., 1907, xxxvII, 375-401, 21 pl.) This valuable paper, with 21 distribution maps, tables, etc., gives re- sults of the investigation of the color of hair and eyes, in the Io districts into which Scotland is divided for the pur- pose, of about half a million school- children. Fair hair shows about the same distribution for both sexes (in all Scotland the average percentage of fair- haired boys is 24.9) ; industrial towns (e. g., Glasgow, and especially Dundee) seem unfavorable to blonds. There is 5.3 per cent. of red hair in all Scotland (boys 5-5, girls 5. I) and the proportion is larger among men in cities. The per- centage of medium or brown hair is 42. I (boys 43.3, girls 40.9) and urban condi- tions favor the survival of brown-haired men. The percentage of dark hair is 25.2 (boys 25, girls 25-4) and of black hair 1.2 (the same for both sexes). The proportion of pure blue eyes for all Scotland is 14.7 (boys 14.6, girls 14.8) ; of light eyes 30.3 (the same for both sexes) ; of medium eyes 32.3 (boys 32.7, girls 32) ; of dark eyes 22.5 (girls 22.8, boys 22.3). The distribution of blue eyes corresponds with that of fair hair, but not that of dark eyes with that of dark hair. Interesting are the high per- centages of fair-haired girls in the Dun- AM.

Les s6pultures de l'6poque de la Tene Miinsingen, Canton de Berne, Suisse. ttude anthropologique sommaire. (R. Ec. d'Anthr. de Paris, 19o8, xvIII, 112-16, I fg.) The im- portant La Tene necropolis of Miin- singen was discovered in 19o6; more than 200 tombs were explored and many skeletons, bronze and iron objects, some gold ornaments, etc. (also weapons, glass rings, amber beads, etc.) discov- ered. G. gives data (description, ce- phalic indices) of 36 skulls (male 19, female 13, children 7, I adult deformed). Of the male skulls 9 were dolichoce- phalic and 6 brachycephalic; of the fe- male skulls 4 dolichocephalic and 6 bra- chycephalic. Two male skulls are tre- panned (I twice). Hauser (F.) The heads of the " Scipio" type. (Amer. J. Archeol., Norwood, Mass., 19o8, xII, 56-57.) Reports the discovery of the upper part of a life-size figure with head of the " Scipio" type and an X-scar cut deep into the left side of the forehead. This proves Dennison's theory that the so-called Scipio heads represent Roman priests of Isis. Hellwig (A.) Hostiendiebstihle in der Schweiz. (Schw. f. Arch. f. Volksk., Basel, 19o8, xII, 143-8.)

At pages 96-8 are given the Polish (from a MS. of 1824) and German texts of medical, etc., folk-lore relating to the lion, eel, weasel, pelican, raven, mole, starling, etc. Kelsey (F. W.) Codrus's Chiron and a painting from Herculaneum. (Amer. J.

Lists and de- scribes bones, etc., of fish, reptiles, birds and mammals (including pig, Bos primi- genius, Cervus Elaphus, horse, - Equus [Asinus] hydruntinus var. siculus). Both fauna and human remains belong to the quaternary. The presence of an elephant indicates either that the industry represented is older than generally thought, or the elephant more recent. Sull' Equus (Asinus) hydruntinus Regdlia della Grotta di Romanelli, Castro, Lecce. (Ibid., 375-90o. From study of lower and upper molars R. concludes that the Equus of the Roma- nelli cave is a distinct species Equus (Asinus) hydruntinus.

Volksk., Basel, 19o8, xII, I-I4.) Cites from records of the Inquisition at Laus- anne in the 15th century data concerning sorcery and agreements with the devil in the Vaud country. Those under the power of Satan were called voudeys and their sabbat was known as the chkte. Some of the accused told what went on at these meetings, which were attended also by the demons themselves. The voudeys "hated everything relating to religion." The impeniterit and obstinate voudeys were handed over to the secular authorities. Child murder and poisoning of people undoubtedly occurred, but the rest of the phenomena are as elsewhere. Robinson (D. M.) Fragment of a Pana- thenaic amphora with the name of the archon Nexechmus. (Amer. J. Archeol., Norwood, Mass., 19o8, xII, 47-48.) This fragment with Neaechmus's name makes altogether 18 amphorae or frag- ments of such vases, with 13 archons' names; these and their dates are given. Nexechmus, 320-319 B. C. Rutot (A.) Sur l'age des squelettes de mineurs ndolithiques d'Obourg et de Str6py. (Bull. Ac. R. d. Belgique, Cl. d. Sci., 1907, 989-1oo3, 26 fgs.) Argues that the flint-workings of Obourg (almost all the implements are of the local black flint) belong to the Campignian epoch, to which are to be referred also the two skeletons discovered at Obourg and Stripy (at the latter place no flint-finishing was done). The animal bones found are those of wild species. - I. La poterie pendant 1'epoque trog- lodytique. II. A propos des pseudo- 0olithes de Cromer. (Bull. Soc. Prehist. de France, 1907, extr., 1-16, 7 fgs.) Cites from 12 caverns (Hastiere, Goyet, Magrite, d'Engis, Trous des Nutons, du Frontal, de Praule, de Chaleux, du Su- reau, du Chene, etc.), explored by M. Ed. Dupont, evidences of the existence of pottery during the troglodyte (paleo- lithic) age, with references to several others, including the "Caillon qui bique " near Roisin, the last belonging to the lower Aurignacian. In France also, R. thinks paleolithic-troglodyte pottery ought to be found. The second article replies to M. Boule's discussion of the " pseudo-eoliths " of Cromer. Accord- ing to R. "pseudo-eoliths" differ from real eoliths in being " essentially ephem- eral," the latter being practically "inde- structible." Schliger (G.) Nachlese zu den Samm- lungen deutscher Kinderlieder.

The jaw in the block of breccia represents a rare type, in respect to teeth (quinquecuspidation of second molar, etc.). M. Capitan thinks that the finding of these human remains in the midst of animal bones, suggests can- nibalism. See Favraud (A.). Sittoni (G.) Le Cinque terre. II. Cam- piglia, Golfo di Spezia.

Ec. d'Anthr. de Paris, 19o8, xvIII, I-19, 5 fgs.) Treats of the introducers of copper on the E. coast of Spain and in Sicily - the rela- tions of Spain with the Asiatic littoral go back to the third millennium B. c. Discusses the brachycephalic crania of the tombs of Orihuela in Alicante, in- vestigated by Siret in 1907 ; the Greek and Phenician remains from the necrop- olis of Villaricos in Almeira; the vicha de Balazote, or human-headed bull from Albacete; the female bust from ancient Ilici in Alicante, known as "1the lady of Elche" ; the female statue, heads, etc., from the Cerro de los Santos. Also the finds in the eneolithic tombs of Castel- luccio, Sicily, and the skulls from there and from Isnello, Chinsilla, Villafrati, etc. Z. believes that this immigrant brachycephalic people of the close of the neolithic period in Spain and Sicily an- tedates the migration of bronze-using, brachycephals from central Europe. They " came directly from the littoral of Asia (Syria) and had customs and beliefs of Mesopotamian origin." Zindel-Kreissig (A.) Schwi~nke und Schildburgergeschichten aus den Sar- ganserland. (Schw. Arch. f. Volksk., Basel, 1908, xII, 54-56.) Some io items of folk-jest at the expense of the "silly" people of Weistann and Sar- gans.

Ethnogr. et So- ciol., Paris, 19o8, II, 200-25, 3 pl.) Treats of the Mahometan population of Tlemcen (the Pomaria of the Romans) in Algeria, once the capital of a Mussulman kingdom. Ethnic groups (Hadar, Ara- bized Berbers; Kuluglis, result of cross between Turks and native women; Ne- groes from Turat and the Soudan), re- ligious life (orthodox Islam); beliefs and superstitions foreign to Islam, -- "mara- boutism," worship of saints, "magic," etc.; public ceremonies, festivals, etc., - Achuri, Mulad, Aid-ey-gr-ir, Aid-el- kebir, the festival of Sheikh Snussi, El- Latif, La Anqra, La Derdeba, etc.), private festivals and ceremonies (birth and early childhood, pregnancy, child- birth, name, circumcision, marriage, death and burial), djinns, etc., are con- sidered. Boreux (C.) Les poteries d6cor6es de l'Egypte pr6dynastique. (Ibid., 33-52, 6 fgs.) Discusses the designs on pre- dynastic Egyptian pottery (Negadeh, etc.) -few purely linear motifs and many designs taken directly from nature (gazelle common, crocodile rare ; water, mountains; but especially trees and boats). The art of these decorations re- sembles that of the "graffiti," rock paintings and carvings, etc., and the basis of all is " magic." On the vases we see the art of the rocks in a little ampler form and evidencing more distinctly a decorative intent. The flora depicted suggest the land of Punt. B. concludes that "the art of Negadeh was the art of the Horians, who, at a primitive period, had extended their domination over all southern Egypt." Delafosse (M.) Le peuple Si6na ou S6- noufo.

The Malagasy year com- menced with a sort of national lustration according to Ellis' account, cited by E., but this is only one part of the ceremony. It was suppressed by the French authori- ties after the conquest of the island. See also p. 277. Gay (G. A.) Recent excavations in Egypt. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 19o8, xxx, 73-77.)

Njoya had seen Haussas and Europeans write. The origin of this writing can be decided only after careful investigation of the ornamental art of the people. Some resemblances to the Vei writing may be detected. Giuffrida-Ruggeri (V.) I crani Egiziani del Museo Civico di Milano. (A. p. l'Antrop., Firenze, 1907, xxxvII, 390- 4Io, 2 pl.) Gives details of form, meas- urements, etc., of 82 male and 6o female Egyptian skulls (of all periods) of Medi- terranean type, compared with Sicilian and Ligurian skulls of this type. The Egyptian face is longer than the Sicilian and Ligurian; more leptorrhine than the Sicilian, but less than the Ligurian. As to cephalic index the Egyptian are closer to the Sicilian. The proportion of penta- gonoid and rhomboid female skulls is high; also that of beloid (II per cent.) male skulls rare. The capacity of the male skulls is high, that of the female (88.4 per cent. of male) low (one of the lowest known). According to G.-R. the negroid type is much less frequent than thought by Thomson and Randall-Mac- Iver, --negroid facial profiles in but 6 skulls out of I59. Skulls of the so-called Eurasian type are not very rare.

O.) Die Isikula-Sprache in Natal, Stidafrika. (Anthropos, I908, III, 508-Ii. ) Gives 60 sentences (with German translations) in the so-called "Kitchen-Kafir," or Isikula (Coolie speech) as the Zulu term it, a jargon, or mixed language of Zulu and English, used chiefly in Natal by Hindus and English--no Hindu element is yet ap- parent. The basis is simplified Zulu plus culture-words, etc., from English. Grammar is also reduced; of the 14 pro- nouns of the third person known to Zulu, Isikula retains only yena (he), bona (she). The amount of " reduc- tion" can be seen from the Isikula yini-daba (what thing?) - "why?" which represents a real Zulu Ku-ya- nga-ni, ukuba? "It is on-account-of what that? " This young language is flourishing and may one day be the dominant speech in Natal. Werner (A.) Some notes on the Bushman race. (R. d. Et. Ethnogr. et Sociol., Paris, 1908, I, 145-50, 2 pl.)

Notes on the Munda family of speech in India. (Ibid., 68-82.) Discusses origin and relations (distinct from Dravidian in language, if not in physical type), name Munda (used by section of race only, other tribes using Manjhi), groups and dialects (14, of which 9, including about 11 of the Mun- das, "are slightly different forms of one and the same language;" Aryan and Dravidian influence on grammar and vo- cabulary), affinities (great differences be- tween some Munda tongues; area once much more extensive, relationship with Mon-Khmer peoples), phonology, forma- tion of words (prefixes and infixes more important than suffixes), subdivision of words (parts of speech; "almost every word can be used as a verb, and a verbal form can, in its turn, be considered as a noun, an adjective or a verb, according to circumstances " ; some dialects have al- most adopted Aryan principles of inflex- ion; numerous personal pronouns). The Munda languages are spoken by 3,164,- 036 people in the hill and jungle country of Chota Nagpur, the adjoining districts of the Madras Presidency and in the Mahadeo Hills of the Central Provinces. Santeli, the principal dialect, counts 1,795,113 speakers. Langdon (St.) Sumerians and Semites in Babylonia. (Babyloniaca, Paris, 19o8, II, 137-161, I pl., 2 fgs.) Partly cri- tique of E. Myer' s Sumerier und Semiten in Babylonien (Berlin, 19o6). L. main- tains that "Ithe more we are coming to know about the history of Babylonian religion, the more it becomes clear how much that is essential was borrowed from the Sumerians," - most of the important cult-words, e. g., are Sumerian. So also the aga head-dress, the da-me stars of IUtar, etc. The cult of Enlil, with its psalms (a translation of one is given) ex- ercised important literary and religious influences upon the Semites. Certain priestly or kingly symbols are also Su- merian in origin, the horned turban, winding dress, etc. Mochi (A.) Sulla antropologia degli Arabi. (A. p. 1' Antrop., Firenze, 1907, xxxvII, 411-28, 3 pl.) Dis- cusses the craniology of the Arabs in gen- eral, gives details of form and measure- ments of 6 Arab skulls from Tripoli and Cairo, and anthropometric data (stature, color of hair and eyes, measurements of lips, head, face, nose) of 29 Arabs from Hedjaz and Yemen. The cephalic in- dices of the Asiatic Arabs range from 71.3 to 88.4, but I9 are higher than 79. Of the 6 African skulls the average is 73.5. The true Arabs seem more brachycephalic than the African Arabs. The Berber ele- ment is strongly represented in the latter. In the Arabian peninsula there are a brachycephalic and a dolichocephalic type. The Semitization of N. Africa is more an ethnographic than an anthro- pologic phenomenon. Mueller (H.) Some remarks on the arti- cle : "Un ancien document in6dit sur les Todas by P. L. Besse, S. J. (An- thropos, Wien, 1908, III, 294-96.) Points out that the " early document " published by Father Besse had appeared in 19o6 in Rivers's The Todas and that better copies of the MSS. are to be found in the British Museum. According to M. pallem is the same as piial or palol, related to the Dravidian word fo r " milk." So this name of the Toda priest and paller have nothing to do with each other. van Oost (P.) Recueil de chansons mon- goles. (Ibid., 219-33.)

Proctor (H.) The tree of life. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 19o8, xxx, 25-27.) (Discusses the Biblical evidence that the eating of the " tree of knowledge " meant carnal intercourse and continuance under the law of generation, while eating of the "tree of life" signified escape from the seduction of the serpent and coming under the law of regeneration. Robinson (G. L.) The vaulted chambers of Petra's high places. (Ibid., 67-72, 3 fgs.) Argues, from Biblical evidence, etc., that, "at Petra, these 'roofed-in chambers' were probably intended and actually used for feasting and prostitu- tion, as well as a depository for idols." Rose (H. A.) Hindu birth observances in the Punjab. (J. R. Anthrop. Inst., Lond., 1907, XXXVII, 220-36.) Treats of observances before and at birth (pre- mature birth, unlucky times for birth and remedies for counteracting the evil influ- ences of the planets, - e. g., symbolic birth from a cow, the first-born, places of confinement, satyd-worship, after- birth, death in child-bed), observances subsequent to birth (period of impurity and taboos, - forty days and rites for each, the jaroldn, well-worship, suck- ling, fosterage, first-clothing or cholad, naming customs, proper names, tonsure, etc.). Muhammedan birth observances in the Punjab. (Ibid., 237-60.) Treats of birth-ceremonies, songs sung to woman, food, tonsure, procedure during the six days after birth; treatment of mother (showing the stars, etc., offerings, fosterage, girl-playmate, verses for hum- ming and singing, women's vigil, birth- day, weaning, circumcision, " ride on a mare," piercing of nose and ears); vows, etc. de St Elie (A. M.) La femme du d6sert autrefois et aujourd'hui. (Anthropos, Wien, 1908, III, 53-67, 181--92, 5 pl.) Treats of the condition and status of the Bedouin woman before and since the advent of Mohametanism. Esteem for woman (names for woman, ancient queens, reverence for the Virgin Mary, priestesses and wise women, hakimat, burial alive of female children), tradi- tion attributing to women the origin of all evils, customs at the birth of a daughter, first education of girls, educa- tion of young women, marriage and wedding customs and ceremonies, divorce (sterility a chief reason), capture of women (still common), woman as wife, rights and duties as mother, old age and widowhood. Father de St Elie objects to the statement of Le Bon that "Islam- ism has elevated the condition of woman," holding that "Iwherever it has penetrated Mohametanism has opwered the condition of woman, making her an utterly inferior creature, the servant of man and his pas- sions." The women of the completely pagan, Christian, or Hebrew tribes were loved, honored, respected and well- treated. The Bedouin woman lost much with the coming of Islam. - Les Racusiens. R6ponse au R.

Treats of name and character of country, races (Chinese; Y-jen of That stock, Miao or "barbarians") and the Miao (pp. 404-25) : Name Miao (usually trans- lated " sons of the soil," but S. suggests identity with Yeou used by the Y-jen to designate them); priority of the Miao (of the three names often borne by localities, - Chinese, Y-jen and Miao, the last is the one that best suits the place); origin of Miao (their national traditions are preserved in rhythmic songs); fabulous ancestor, Pan-hu; po- litical situation (no longer any S&amp;u miao, or unconquered Miao, all being subject to Chinese authority); revolts; usages, customs, etc. (marriage, funerals), dress; character (less cunning than Chinese, less open to missionary influence and ideas than other races; they have "the morality of the heathen"); language (various tribes speak dialects of one lan- guage ; according to S. the Miao " have no system of writing"); superstitions (demon-cult); religious traditions (crea- tion of the world and of man, - the creator was a potter and the skull is only a vessel turned upside-down; deluge- legends ; origin of diversity of languages; story of King Bamboo).

(Nat. Geogr. Ma g., Wash., 1907, xvIII, 602-II, 7 pl., I fg. ) Some of the illustrations (native types of Fanning id., the Marquesas, Pago Pago, Fiji, etc.) are of ethnologic interest. One represents Samoan women playing cricket. Best (E.) Personifications of nature among the Maoris of New Zealand. (Amer.

Die Niol-Niol, ein Einge- borenenstamm in Nordwest-Australien. (Anthropos, Wien, 19o8, III, 32-40, I pl., map.) First part. Treats of the question of the aborigines and " civiliza- tion " ( according to B. "Ia black woman as a rule, after bearing a half caste child, never brings a full-blood one into the world "; native women are often fertile with white men after having been long sterile with husbands of their own race), etc. Reservations and islands are too much needed for the whites to make them very serviceable for the blacks. The missions do good work. B.'s plan is for the Gov- ernment to establish cattle-stations at every aboriginal center, with agricultural addition, to be carried on by the mission- aries or the state authorities. Emerson (N. B.) Hawaii's race-problem. (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 19o8, XXXVII, 11o-113.)

Illustrations (yanggona- making, infant heading-binding, dances, " sacred house," ancestral idols, scar- tattooing, etc. ) of ethnologic interest. Howitt (A. W.) The native tribes of southeast Australia. (J. R. Anthrop. Inst., Lond., 1907, xxxvII, 268-78.) Replies to criticisms of author's state- ments in his Native Tribes of Southeast Australia by Andrew Lang in his The Secret of the 7Totem. - Australian group-relationships. (Ibid., 279-88.) Against Lang, H. maintains that the tribes of the southeast who have not got pirrauru, " did at one time have a marriage of the type of the pirrauru of the Dieri." Far back I1. sees "a period of general promiscuity between the sexes." At pages 287-89 are given lists of marital, parental, filial, fraternal, etc. terms in various Australian tongues. The native tribes of Southeast Aus- tralia. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1908, xxx, 81-95.) Criticizes statements by R. H. Mathews in two recent papers and replies to his critiques of the author's views, etc. H. thinks M. altogether mistaken in his opinion that exogamy does not exist among the Victorian tribes. He also thinks the Kurnu tribe to be now a mixture,- with some of the tribes " the younger generation grew up in comparative ignorance of the old customs and beliefs of the tribes to which their parents belonged (this was largely due to the "station" policy of the Govern- ment, the education of the native children, etc.). The total number of aborigines in Victoria in 1907 was 270 (including 81 half-castes) as against 1,690 in 1861 and about 6,ooo in 1835. - Personal reminiscences of Central Australia and the Burke and Wills expe- dition.

Observations on Dr Grijn's investigations of the sense of smell, which indicated that that of the natives (Javanese) was twice as keen as that of the Europeans." Dr ten K. thinks G.'s natives were a sort of Hlite and did not represent the Javanese generally, in view of the less sense of smell among the Japanese, etc. Ana- tomical and physiological factors, as well as psychological, have to be taken into account here. Lang (A.) Exogamy. (R. d. t. Ethnogr. et Sociol., Paris, 19o8, T, 65-78.) Ar- gues that "the Arunta rule, with conse- quent non-exogamy of totems, can be nothing but a relatively recent innovation, which has not yet produced all its neces- sary results; " also that "Ithe non-recog- nition of physical paternity is not neces- sarily a survival of pristine ignorance of physiology, but is a logical consequence of the Central Australian philosophy of eternal incarnation of spirits." More- over, there are "natural human motives, verce cause, for every step in the evolu- tion of Australian marriage rules, so far as we know these rules." European group sobriquets (blason po.ulaire) " are not a survival of totemism, but they indicate a popular tendency to give such group sobriquets, out of which totemism may have arisen." Mathews (R. H.) Some native lan- guages of Western Australia. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 19o08, xxx, 28-31.) Grammatical outline of the language spoken in the neighborhood of Perth, based on an elementary grammar of that tongue published by Mr Charles Sim- mons in the Western Australian Al- manac for 1842. The language was "practically the same as far south as King George's Sound; it also extended north from Perth about 150 miles or further." Mead (C. W.) The Bismarck Archipel- ago collection. (Amer. Mus. J., N. Y., 19o8, vIII, 37-42, 3 fgs.)

Der Ackerbau in Neuguinea und auf den angrenzenden Inseln. (An- thropos, Wien, 19o8, III, 234-38.) Gen- eral account of agriculture in New Guinea and neighboring islands. Manure is un- known (prejudice against it exists), but letting lie fallow is common. The inland tribes are more agricultural than those of the coast. Yams, taro, sweet pota- toes are planted largely. The harder work is done by men. Coconuts, ba- nanas, bread-fruit, pandanus, betel-nut, and papaya are cultivated also (manioc only in Bogia bay). The sago-palm is important.

According to Dr Grana, "' there can be no doubt as to the existence of syphilis in America previous to its discovery," - it was the Quechuan huanti. There appears to be, however, no proof that the llama suf- fered from this disease in pre-Columbian times. At present in both Indians and llamas syphilis is rare. The quicksilver cure was not known before the coming of the Spaniards. The results of experi- mental inoculation of llamas with syphilis are also given. Bayliss (C. K.)

Second report on the Eskimo of Baffin land and Hudson bay. (Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., N. Y., 1907, xv, 371-570, 96 fgs., 6 pl.) Treats of material culture (instruments, untensils, weapons, decorative art, etc.), general observations (on Eskimo of various re- gions in question), customs and religious ideas (mythology, birth and childhood, death, game-customs, charms, angekok, fall festival, etc. ) of Eskimo of Southamp- ton id., west coast of Hudson bay, Hud- son str., Ponds bay, Cumberland id. At pp. 518-36 are given English texts of 18 tales from Cumberland id., at pp. 536-54 texts of 22 tales from the west coast of Hudson bay, and at pp. 558-64, 3 native texts from Cumberland id., with interlinear and free English translations. Among Dr B's conclusions are: The re- lations between the Eskimo of Hudson</page><page sequence="20">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 487 bay and Baffin land and those of Green- land and of Alaska are much closer than has been generally assumed; the exuber- ance of form so characteristic of objects of Eskimo manufacture west of the Mac- kenzie river is due essentially to the stimulus received from foreign cultures, particularly from that of the Indian. The Eskimo have deeply influenced the culture of some of the N. E. Asiatic tribes (Chukchee, Koryak), and these may pos- sibly have influenced the Eskimo methods of skin-decoration. Eskimo pictographic etching is more related to Indian art. The woman's knife is not of as late intro- duction into Greenland as Solberg thinks, nor are simple harpoon points made of a single piece of bone necessarily older than those made of bone with a stone point. The edging of knives with small pieces of iron is older than the introduction of European iron. The data in tales and legends also indi- cate closeness of culture originally, from Alaska to Greenland. Alaskan culture is much modified by Indian and possibly also by Asiatic influences. Eskimo taboos of contact between land-animals and sea- animals suggest an inland origin for the stock. Boyle (D.) Additions to the Museum, 1907. (Ann. Arch. Rep., 1907, Toronto, 1908, 7-I I.)

Both Aymaras and Quechuas are brachycephalic (ay. index 82), about '3 being mesaticephalic. In about Y3 of the cases the stature is greater than the fin- ger-reach. The Quechuas are taller than the Aymaras, though the finger-reach of both is the same. The thoracic circum- ference of the Aymaras is greater and the trunk longer ; their forehead is also lower and more retreating and the height of head less. Theskin-color of the Quechuas is darker, also the eyes. Optimistic views of the future of the mitis race of Bolivia and the Indians are entertained, - the 24,000,000 people who inhabit the mountain regions of Spanish America count about 16,ooo,ooo metis, 6,000,000 Indians, and 2,000,000 pure whites. Dr C. is of opinion that the amplitude of chest observed among the Indians of the plateaus is due to race and not to alti- tude of habitat. The detailed anthro- pometric data, etc., of this expedition (Sfiiechal de la Grange et de Crequi Montfort) have appeared in two volumes on L'Anthropologie Bolivienne. In all some 500 anatomical specimens (skulls and complete skeletons) of pre-Spanish origin were collected. Darton (N. H.)

According to Dr D. "the shaman in America may be said as a type to exemplify one of the most characteristic attributes of the In- dian as a race," and proves that, in spite of minor differences, " the culture of the American Indians is fundamentally one in type."

The sleeveless shirt of similar material, weave, and character, was rare and worn by men only. After death the blanket serves as shroud, and after the cremation of the corpse and the deposition of the ashes, it is hung on the outside of the grave- house. In the eighties blankets and shirts were still in common use among the Chilcat, but white influences, etc., have caused their disappearance.

Scrapers, knives, borer-points, awls, axes, ulos, etc., harpoon, lance and arrow-points, transitional forms, etc., are considered. According to S., the stone implements, etc., of the Eastern Eskimo are unusually old in character as compared with other Eskimo regions. Isolation has had its influence upon Greenland stone art, and the introduction of iron by the Europeans has influenced it much. The ulo, or woman's knife, he thinks, was introduced into Greenland at a relatively late period. In Greenland stone art has two aspects, one retaining old forms, etc., from the original Eskimo home, the other showing special forms developed in loco. See Boas (F.). Sparkman (P. S.)

The influence of the Negroes is seen in certain peculiar mythical ideas (out of harmony with American Indian mythology in general) and in a " minimizing of the credulity and seriousness with which the Creeks regarded their native beliefs," while, on the other hand, " in the ordinary customs of daily life and practice the Negroes and mixed-bloods of the nation show the characteristics of Creeks." There are</page><page sequence="25">492 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., IO, 1908 four classes : Old full-blood conservative Indians with nearly all their native attri- butes; the mixed Indian-Negroes who are conservative too and have become Indianized; so to speak ; the progressive Indians and mixed bloods, who have be- come modernized; and the old Negro freedmen, who hold themselves intact from both modern influences and Indian influence, preserving what is best repre- sented by the 'old plantation' type."
