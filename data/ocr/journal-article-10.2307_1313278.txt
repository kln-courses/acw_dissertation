In one sense, little can be done to an introductory biology textbook to make it different from its competi- tion. All the important topics in biol- ogy need to be covered, and there seems to be agreement, at least among textbook publishers, as to what these topics are: the cell and its constitu- ents; genetics; evolution, including taxonomy; the structure and func- tion of plants and animals; ecology; and behavior. Both Basic Biology: Concepts and Applications and Bi- ology: Life on Earth cover all of these topics, and they do so in simi- lar sequence, starting with the cell and working up to ecology. There is an eternal discussion among biologists as to whether this approach is the most effective or whether it might be better to begin with macrobiology-that is, with ecology and evolution-and then travel down the levels of organiza- tion, ending with genetics and cell biology. The latter approach seems to be particularly appropriate for students who are not majoring in careers in biology-the students to whom both of these texts are ad- dressed. Such students often arrive in the college biology classroom with a prejudice against the subject; being immersed immediately in material on atoms and molecules and on cells is a questionable introduction to bi- ology that has less intuitive appeal than would the readily visible plants and animals dealt with in ecology. The authors of both Basic Biol- ogy: Concepts and Applications and Biology: Life on Earth have chosen to stick with the more traditional "bottom-up" sequence. In fact, both textbooks are quite traditional in many ways, despite the latest in supplementary materials and testi- monials by the authors as to their commitment to innovation. In both books, the material is covered com- petently, with Starr's text taking a slightly more hurried approach be- cause it is approximately 200 pages shorter. The writing in both is clear and understandable, but neither book makes much attempt, apart from the boxes interspersed in the chapters, to relate the material to environmen- tal or health issues or to issues about biological inquiry. Because the Audesirks' book is the fourth edition and Starr's is the third edition, it could be argued that each has responded to the earlier editions of the other, as well as to textbooks by other authors. Some similarities are inevitable because both books cover the same subject for the same audience, but some of the resemblances seem to go beyond simple coincidence. The process of responding to competition leads to a homogenization of the products, with each author afraid not to meet the latest challenges of the others. For example, both books have chapter highlights at the beginning, with the Audesirks' being easier to grasp; both have similar end-of-chapter ques- tions, including objective and thought questions; both have sug- gested readings, with Starr's selec- tions being so scant as to be almost useless. Despite all the discussion that has been going on in science education about teaching concepts rather than facts and about developing students' thinking skills along with teaching them content, these books are as nearly focused on facts and negligent of intellectual excitement as the texts of 20 years ago. If I come away from reading these books feeling logy with an information overload, and I have been teaching biology for over 25 years, then how are my students go- ing to feel? Because biology is the most visual of the sciences, a biology textbook should be visually appealing, par- ticularly in our visually oriented cul- ture and for an audience that might need to be enticed into engagement with the text. A great deal of atten- tion has obviously been paid to the use of illustrations in both books. Illustrations are provided at almost every point at which the reader would desire one, and the images in both books clearly make the intended points. To me, these attributes are essential for any biology text that I would adopt because I consider vi- sual images crucial in the develop- ment of a student's understanding of biological concepts. In this impor- tant aspect, both books are more than adequate. Although the dia- grams are beautifully executed, some of the most arresting images in both books are photographs of living or- ganisms. Nothing seems able to top the appeal and the information value of such photographs. But here again, there seems to be a convergence; both books use the same fungal spe- cies (a stinkhorn fungus) to repre- sent fungi in the first chapter and the exact same photograph of diatoms in their microorganism chapters. The photograph on the cover of the Audesirks' book is problematic; it shows a macaque standing on its hind limbs in the snow and holding a rather large snowball in its forearms. This image, although striking, is a little too anthropomorphic for many biologists' tastes; in portraying a nonhuman species as having human- like traits, it seems to indicate that March 1998 223</page><page sequence="2">the book has an implied focus on humans. This point is admittedly mi- nor, but I think that those of us who teach introductory biology have a re- sponsibility to consider all aspects of the text we choose for our students, including the subtle messages it may be sending almost subliminally. Both books come with a vast ar- ray of supplementary materials, some of which are available free when the book is adopted, others of which are available for a fee. Because these supplements were not supplied with the review copies, I cannot comment on their quality; however, they seem to provide a variety of forms of sup- port for both instructors and stu- dents, with Starr's book coming with a richer assortment of materials than the Audesirks'. A significant omis- sion in both books is the lack of computer programs to provide stu- dents with simulations and open- ended explorations and experimen- tal situations. Although the selection of supplements provided with both textbooks is impressive, the burgeon- ing of supplements, even though use- ful for teachers, also can add to their burdens. Teachers must master not only the material in the texts, but also that in such sources as supple- mentary readings, CD-ROMs, and Internet sites. The new stress on multimedia presentations and on in- tegrating the Internet into instruc- tion is a challenge to both experi- enced and novice teachers. Those who have been in the classroom for years must change their teaching styles radically to accommodate these new sources of information. And new teachers have to worry not only about mastering content and classroom teaching techniques, but also about being comfortable with several forms of technology in the teaching setting. Does all this emphasis on supple- mentary materials mean that the con- tent of the text is less important than the peripherals that accompany it? I do not think so. At the moment, the textbook is still at the core of biol- ogy instruction in most classrooms; it provides a common ground where teachers and students can meet. The Internet, videos, and CD-ROMs are, indeed, supplementary to most in- struction. But if textbooks are still central to instruction, are they doing the job we want them to do? Are we even clear about what that job is? The recent interest in making college biology instruction more inquiry based and encouraging students to be more active learners does not seem to have greatly influenced the au- thors of these texts. MAURA FLANNERY St. Vincent's College St. Johns University Jamaica, NY 11439 PUBLISHING NEWS Plant Pathogens and the Worldwide Movement of Seeds is a new book published by the American Phyto- pathological Society. The authors of this volume, which is edited by Denis C. McGee, explore the world seed regulatory system, identify the im- pact of seed health regulations on global seed movement, and discuss solutions to the increasing incidence of seed-borne diseases as well as seed pathology research priorities. This book will interest educators, plant pathologists, seed technologists, and professionals at seed companies and seed regulatory agencies. Plant Pathogens and the Worldwide Move- ment of Seeds is available for $32.00 (plus $4.00 shipping).

The American Phytopathological Society has also recently released the Compendium of Lettuce Diseases. Authors R. Michael Davis, Krishna V. Subbarao, Richard N. Raid, and Edward A. Kurtz examine not only infectious diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, nematodes, and viruses, but also noninfectious disorders such as air pollution, allelopathy, mineral deficiencies and toxicities, and pesti- cide-related injury. This reference will be of interest to lettuce growers, plant pathologists, crop protection special- ists, students, and other plant profes- sionals. The Compendium of Lettuce Diseases is available for $35.00 (plus $4.00 shipping).
