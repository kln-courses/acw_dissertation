<plain_text><page sequence="1">G. HERBERT-BROWN (ED.), OVID'S FASTI. HISTORICAL READINGS AT ITS BIMILLENNIUM. New York: Oxford University Press, 2002. Pp. xvi + 328, 3 pIs. ISBN 0-I9-815475-5. ?50.00. 'The reanimation of Ovid's poetic corpus has been completed' - so Philip Hardie introduced The Cambridge Companion to Ovid (2002). Given very persistent classicist traditions about the Fasti, the claim could be revolutionary. For Schanz-Hosius another kind of categorical judgment arose, 'Doch die Glanzseite des Werkes sind die poetischen Illustrationen zum Festkalender' (2.23 i) of scant use for religious information since (232) 'Das religiose Empfinden war ihm versagt'. Scarcely more charitable were the Roman religion specialists, thus Kurt Latte 'Altromische Religiositait lag ... recht fern' (RR 7). Until recently, perhaps the best the Fasti received came from E. J. Kenney (CHCL 2): 'purely literary exercise' (429) which elicits from the literary critic 'admiration tempered with apology' (430). Have matters changed so radically in two decades? Even earlier arose the recognition that here be a poet who never met an ambiguity he did not like, subject to an emperor paradoxos in ancient and modern senses. Especially thoughtful handling of the poeta ludens became de rigueur. But the subject of the Fasti constitutes an additional issue. Roman religion was not a 'religion of the book' but of multiple books canonical, at best, only for a particular cult or priesthood, readily subject to ad hoc modification at the hands of its practitioners whether a proconsul of Syria or a farmer tilling ten iugera. Too, the already diverse documentary 'religious knowledge' survives principally in fragments, literary or epigraphic - and yet the fullest and thus most traditionally influential accounts of Roman religion come from extant Roman imaginative literature whose authors, whether prose or poetry, often had agenda other than unvarnished presentation of 'religious information'. Fully to grapple with the literary presentation of Roman religion in imaginative literature thus demands intimacy with documentary religious knowledge whose texts and scholarship thereon are most decidedly not reader-friendly. If one would broach the Fasti as literature, one must utilize literary acumen, historical sensitivity, and religious knowledge while remaining responsive to the aforementioned ambiguities. No small undertaking, that. Some have succeeded. From literary specialists have come Ralph Johnson's 'The desolation of the Fasti' (CJ 74 (I978/9), 7-I8) and Alessandro Barchiesi's The Poet and the Prince (I997). As for history there is Geraldine Herbert-Brown, Ovid and the Fasti (I994). From Roman religion specialists have come articles by Mary Beard (e.g. PCPS 33 (I987), I-I5, idem Suppl. i6 (I989), 4I-6i) and individual pieces by Christopher McDonough (TAPA I27 (I997), 3I5-44) and the reviewer (Arethusa 25 (I992), 55-8o). Here the Fasti ceases to be merely a mine of literary tropes (for literary critics), merely a source of oft-dubious cult information (for Roman religion specialists). Thus the current volume appears bonis auspiciis. Four essays shine. Barchiesi considers Fasti 5 on Mars' visit to the Forum Augustum. Wide- ranging use of archaeology (Zanker), religion (Scheid), praetextae and the Carmen Arvale (io-i i) lead to whether Ovid 'is complimenting the Augustan programme or bringing it to breaking point' (2I). Fans of Emma Gee's Ovid, Aratus, and Augustus (2000) will not be disappointed. Here she turns deep knowledge of astronomical traditions to Sirius and Orion in Fasti 4 (Robigalia) and 5 (Mars Ultor) respectively. No longer transitional or traditional calendrical, star lore represents Ovid's meditation on both the temporal circumstances of the festivals and Augustan literary appropriation of astronomical information; provocatively, the oft-denigrated 'astronomical errors' become another side of the poeta ludens. Herbert-Brown contextualizes star-lore via the 'astrological' Manilius, and Augustus' edict of A.D. i i. Multiple revision levels suggest Ovid could have covered his earlier tracks, thus Fasti 7-I2 desunt because of too much (astrological) material. Finally, Peter Wiseman on Ovid and the stage considers the Great Mother of 4 along the lines of his Roman Drama and Roman History (I998). Stagecraft alludes to popular kinds of religious knowledge, woefully</page><page sequence="2">III. THE EMPIRE 383 underrepresented in extant evidence - hence a fascinating counterpoint. As often, Wiseman writes that rare essay which one eagerly anticipates rereading. Seven essays do not shine: women in cult (Elaine Fantham, Peter Keegan), the Great Mother (Peter Knox), Numa (R. Littlewood), Liberalia (John Miller), Vedius Pollio and Concordia (Carole Newlands), and Julio-Claudian holidays (Molly Pasco-Pranger). Some of these essayists have substantial repute in literary studies, others are 'new to the field' (vi). All differentially manifest kindred issues. There appears a cavalier disregard of etymologies and linguistics as the essayists, untroubled by Walde-Hofmann and Ernout-Meillet, use Maltby (2I8-I9) and none too often; Festus requires more than occasional nods (4I), multiple etymologies and aitia should not be listed yet ignored (2I9-20, 257-8). Some have clearly studied Roman religion but not used it beyond bibliographic show (36 n. 40, 200 n. 6), most confine themselves to commentaries and first available (not necessarily the best) scholarship, a few virtually ignore religion. There is unqualified use of controversial works such as Dumezil for religion (I75 n. 2), Alfoldi (I77 n. 4) for early history, as if demonstrating that another had the same strange idea outweighs demonstrating plausibility. Livy's Patavinitas has puzzled Quintilian, Syme too, but not Keegan (I46); the 'large letter' thesis of the epigraphic calendar has exercised Agnes Michels (The Calendar of the Roman Republic (I967), 207-20) but not Pasco-Pranger (257). Sensitive evaluation of underlying literary traditions, where several essayists have made valuable contributions elsewhere, is lacking. Engagement with the current state of literary criticism lacks - see now, e.g., Alison Sharrock and Helen Morales, Intratextuality (2000). The insightful close reading does appear, but overall there remains the uncomfortable feeling of essayists reading reflexively not reflectively, producing little that could not have been written two decades earlier. Such disengagement with Roman religion makes it hard to take these seven seriously. Last, definitely least is Carin Green on Varro's ARD and the Fasti, a disappointment for all regardless of speciality. Bad: old wheezes such as the educated ceased believing in anthropomorphic gods (7I), 'false' etymology serves only to confirm 'underlying perception' (87 n. I9), some festivals were 'minor' (93). She seems innocent of the value of editions by Agahd (I898) and Merkel (I84I), writes as if Varro's other works offer religion nothing, and manages to avoid almost all scholarship on Varro. Worse: a silly summary of etymologies (78-9), a wildly extended (84-99) summary of Fasti 4. Worst: the idea passim that if we can elucidate Varro's 'theology' we can elucidate Roman religion - as if any Roman needed a Summa to practise religion. The most charitable reaction should be . .. risus sardonicus. Two-thirds of this volume, then, is missed opportunity: literary concerns and religion concerns have common ground amenable to dialectic and consequently productive of illumination. Linguist- ics and etymology: literary could teach religion that 'false' etymologies can have poetic point, religion can evaluate the pluralities of such religious knowledge. Consider the difference here between Barchiesi (I 3) and Pasco-Pranger (266) and, as exemplar, James O'Hara, True Names (i996). Source criticism: literary can demonstrate to religion the imaginative point in fragments of Varro or Festan lexicalia, while religion can stress the variability of the fragments' information. Literature can ask 'what did the poet write and why?', religion 'what did the poet know and when?' Such dialectic, leavened by, e.g. intratextuality, could reanimate literary study of the Fasti. As for this volume, so for literary studies of the Fasti - a minority have troubled to expand specialist horizons. As for the majority, pars pro toto one of the essayists has elsewhere reviewed Fantham's commentary on Fasti 4 without mentioning Roman religion. 'Medio maxima turba mari est' (Prop. 3.3.24).
