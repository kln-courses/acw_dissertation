Printed in Great Britain SCULPTURE: EROTIKONS AND IDOLONS Nina Holton* The theme of the sculptures that I shall describe is the theme of encounter, of tenderness, of a unity lost, searched for or found. As the Mexican poet- essayist Octavio Paz wrote: 'For an immense moment we catch a glimpse of our lost unity' [1]. These two series of sculptures, Erotikons and Idolons, are my visual conceptions of mythic lovers of the distant past. In trying to put into words my thoughts and preoccupations when sculpting these biomorphic objects, I remember Herbert Read's remark in The Origins of Form in Art: 'The greatest enemy of originality is, perhaps, the Zeitgeist, that pervasive spirit in a country which at a particular period of time unconsciously compels artists of all kinds to adopt a common idiom, to relinquish their personal choice of language' [2], p. 20. A common theme of contemporary art in the U.S.A. and in other countries of the West seems to be derangement and brutalization, which reflects the gloomy pattern of this century with its wars and holocausts. Beyond art, even the science of physics appears to have been open to the theme of disjunction and disintegration, as indicated by the terms that have entered its language, such as radio- active decay, decay of particles, displacement laws, nuclear disintegration, discontinuity, dislocation, indeterminacy, uncertainty, strangeness quantum numbers, negative states, particle annihilation and black holes. It is perhaps because I am looking toward the more utopian or beneficent potentials of human societies that I have tried to find in my sculpture expressions of the joyous and harmonious elements of life, of the basic forces of integration that provide for me the positive rationale of existence. The visual aspects of my sculptures are not intended to be guided by the current Zeitgeist but they are my response to ideograms and signs, old and new. The sketches that I make for my sculptures (Fig. 1) are almost always directly in clay or Plasteline, which I then rework and refine in wax for casting in bronze. Each sketch starts out in the form of a sign [3, 4], which evolves some- times into 3-dimensional form-a totemic image. * Artist living at 14 Trotting Horse Drive, Lexington, MA 02173, U.S.A. (Received 5 Dec. 1974.) The Erotikons are my interpretation of figures of tenderness and ecstacy (Fig. 2), of encounter and detumescence (Fig. 3). They are erotic but not realistic representations of carnality. These fantasy figures present a viewer with interpretations Fig. 1. Sketches in Plasteline. Fig. 2.

The em- bracing couples (Fig. 2) are meant to signify their search for unity, their affirmation of life, of a humanity that defies brutality and breakdown. My beloved is like a gazelle, or a young stag. Behold, there he stands behind our wall, gazing in at the windows, looking through the lattice. My beloved speaks and says to me: Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away; for lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone. The flowers appear on the earth, the time of singing has come ... [5]. At times the Erotikons reflect a serious, at times a playful, aspect but are meant to be responsive to a sense of the unity of life: 'The self-oblivion of earthly lovers locked in each others arms, where "each is both" ' [6]. The Idolons are a set of individual figures intended as heroes or heroines (Fig. 4). They are separate strong entities who stand alone and seem to be in a state of waiting, repose or contemplation. While the Idolons have primitive, mythic roots, their design has a present-day character. Picasso is reported to have said: 'When you paint, close your eyes and sing.' In this sense, I close my eyes and let my hand mold the shapes that have impressed themselves on my memory. Sometimes the studio is crowded with panels of sketches of embryonic figures (Fig. 1). They seem to come of an older civilization. But at the same time, I find that there are few objects in my sur- roundings that remain entirely irrelevant to my eye. My fascination with the shapes and symbols in the day-to-day environment penetrates into an emerg- ing, seemingly casual object and metamorphoses it into a sign. The very tools with which I work become a part of my clay sketches, analogous to the situation in quantum physics where the apparatus of the experi- menter becomes interwoven with the phenomenon of nature that he is exploring. As I look at my tools, they seem to carry me to memories of an earlier culture-to a lost collection of totem figures with a long history. The tools seem to be saying something that I can and must compre- hend: they are like beings in search of a sculptor who will use them to express what they stand for. A sentence from James Joyce's Ulysses comes to mind: 'Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the Gods' [7]. Even the most common objects present a reminiscence of a possibility that permits trans- formation into a new, idealized shape. My range Fig. 3.

Some time ago, at a crowded party, I met a professor of aesthetics from a highly esteemed university. The party was too noisy for conversa- tion and the professor, I noticed, had had quite a few drinks. Later, as I was returning home I encountered a curious sight. The professor, now 134</page><page sequence="3">Sculpture: Erotikons and Idolons Fig. 4. Left: 'Idolon, I: Nubila', bronze, height 13 in., 1972.

With a most belligerent attitude he stepped up to the parking meter and loudly began to abuse and berate it. He shook his fists at the cool, upright metallic shape before him and said: 'Don't you dare to say "Expired" to me.' The crowd that had gathered around him thought it was a fine performance. As I made my way home, the inebriated aesthetician's act became the more reasonable the more I thought about it. In his confusion and excitement, he had clearly caught a glimpse of what the designer of the object had unconsciously produced-a totemic figure with bulbous head and severe, no-nonsense face, un- yielding, immovable, emanating the aura of threat and fear towards those who do not obey its clicking noises, until it hands down its final judgment: 'Expired'. In this sense, many objects made by human beings, including machines such as com- puters, may take on a totemic aspect. To dismiss this recognition as animism or anthropomorphism is entirely off the point for me as an artist. On the contrary, the task I accept is to discover the mes- sage that may be implied in a utilitarian object and to give it aesthetic expression. Lewis Mumford, in Art and Technics, says: 'Going back to the earliest forms of art and technics that anthropological research has turned up, I pointed out that man is both a symbolmaker and a toolmaker from the very outset, because he has a need both to express his inner life and to control his outer life. But the tool, once so respon- sive to man's will, has turned into an automaton; and at the present moment, the development of automatic organizations threatens to turn man himself into a mere passive tool' [8]. In my work, the reversal of this fear of man becoming machine takes place. First, a non- figurative object serves to convey a message of human feeling, whether it is passion or satiety. Second, the tools are allowed to return to a certain human context, as though once upon a time they had been totemic images. As an artist, I take control of these feelings and embody them in an object. 'Art is a biological phenomenon: that is my basic assumption', Herbert Read wrote in a passage with which I find myself in full agreement. 'Art has been present as a characteristic of the human race ever since the species emerged from the obscurity of prehistory, and there is plenty of evidence to suggest that art, which is the skill required to give meaningful shape to human artifacts, was one of the agencies of that emergence. Man became civilized to the degree that he could refine on mere utility, on the tools and husbandry that had been essential to survival' [2, p. 174]. As for the Erotikons and Idolons, I expect them to increase in number, to grow taller, and, hope- fully, to find their way into city squares and parks where the passerby will stop and wonder of what they remind him, what they might be-creatures or things, outside or within himself, or perhaps both ?
