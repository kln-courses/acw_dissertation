<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Educational Semantic Web: A Vision for the Next Phase of Networked Learning Terry Anderson The Educational Semantic Web (ESW) is a vision for the next phase of networked learning. Unlike the current Web, the Semantic Web is based on an assumption that information is self-aware and capable of processing itself. This 'intelligence' gives rise to a whole series of new affordances, allowing education applications to leverage the capacity of information to search, format, configure, and present itself in response to individual, social, and discipline learning needs. The vision of the ESW is not new. Despite the recent introduction of the term Semantic Web by the designer of the original World Wide Web (WWW), Tim Berners- Lee, in 1997, researchers in artificial intelligence in education, computer-assisted learning, and early network-orientated teachers have been working at the seemingly quixotic goal of being able to create and retrieve learning sequences that uniquely respond to individual and group learner needs and profiles. These sequences are multi-formatted learning activities, that are available 'anytime/anyplace.' Unlike earlier developments that are tied to stand-alone machines and technologies, the ESW vision includes the sense of community and social computing, where machines are used as multimodal communications devices to support collaborative inquiry and communities of inquiry in addition to individual construction of knowledge. Like previous large and potentially paradigmatic- shattering visions, it is easy to over-hype the envisioned technology and make unsupportable and irrefutable claims that confuse us with their shift from the real and the practical to the Utopian claims of the technical evangelist. Let me be clear from the outset that the Terry Anderson is Canada Research Chair in Distance Education at Athabasca University, Athabasca, Canada (e- mail: terry@athabascau.ca). Educational Semantic Web does not exist today. It may never exist in the ways that are illustrated in this overview, written from an early-pioneer perspective. But it is equally true that each of the features and affordances of the Educational Semantic Web exists in some form today. The Semantic Web vision is being forged and instantiated today in contexts ranging from e-business, to information storage, to social networks, and in almost every other network-intense application. No single field has spawned a fully functional Semantic Web, yet in single applications and in the aggregate, the Semantic Web is being created and tested in every domain. The Educational Semantic Web, like other educational technologies, will be born and developed in other more technically advanced disciplines and then appropriated, configured, refined, and improved for educational use. My interest in the Educational Semantic Web stems from work on Web-based applications and the analysis of computer conferencing transcripts (see http:// communitiesofinquiry.com ). We needed tools that could reduce the chaos of thousands of computer conferencing messages created during net-based courses, that though available in machine-readable format, required currently unavailable applications to quickly and reliably extract educationally relevant information. Reading the work of Berners-Lee and following the development releases of various tools by development and standardization groups, notably the World Wide Web Consortium (WC3), convinced me of two underlying suppositions that continue to propel my interest. The first is that the Semantic Web has tremendous potential to create new ways of supporting education that can be used to very dramatically improve current models and methods of education; but, more importantly, it will become the platform that supports new 'beyond the course' models of lifelong learning. The second is that the technology is very much more complicated than the graphically orientated presentation format of the current Web. To overcome and deal with this complexity and create ESW applications useful for practicing educators will require the effort of large, multi-disciplined, and highly skilled teams of technicians, knowledge engineers, computer scientists, and educators. Most of the early work on the Internet has focused on performance, addressing, prioritizing, and other technical issues. The current application level of development now needs to manifest these affordances in discipline, industry, and context-relevant tools. My own learning experience with the ESW began with a few talks I gave at various universities in 2002. In these talks I overviewed the promise of the ESW and the technologies being developed to realize that promise. The feedback from these talks prompted me to search for other educators who were working in this field. Rather surprisingly, my initial forays using terms EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/September-October 2004 5</page><page sequence="2">such as 'Educational Semantic Web' on the commercial search engines resulted in many more hits to my own rather superficial talks than to a host of educational researchers working in the domain. However, I was able to uncover a disparate set of educators, many with computer science backgrounds, who were making tentative probes into models, developing prototypes, and theorizing ways to create the Educational Semantic Web. Together with Denise Whitelock from the Open University, UK, I approached these researchers and solicited articles that form the content of a special issue on the Educational Semantic Web published in the online Journal of Interactive Media in 2004. Realizing the gap that exists between the prototypical works described in these papers and practicing educators, we also commissioned leading educational authors and practitioners to respond to each article. These articles opened a discussion on the practicality and implications of the authors' ideas in the real world of teaching and learning. This present article for Educational Technology highlights and overviews the work discussed in this larger volume. The article begins with a brief description of the technological affordances of the ESW and then expands these potentials into a look at where we are today, the challenges and obstacles we have encountered, and where we need to go to realize the vision of the ESW. Affordances of the ESW It has become useful to think of technology capabilities as affordances, a term that acknowledges both the capacity of the tool to assist in performing defined tasks and the capacity of the user to effectively use the tool to achieve meaningful goals. The primary affordances of the ESW fall into three broad areas. The first is the capacity for search, retrieval, and creation of information that is aware of its own content and place within a variety of ontological organizational schemes. The second is the capacity for the ESW to more completely support, archive, and retrieve human interactions, in multiple formats, that are delivered both asynchronously and synchronously. The third is the capacity for computer programs, constructed as autonomous agents, to traverse the ESW on behalf of students, teachers, and content itself, and not only retrieve and configure information for educational use, but also to 'intelligently' make inferences and judgments with the information they find (Anderson &amp; Whitelock, 2004). Educational Semantic Web Applications ESW applications are dependent upon developments in all three of the affordances described above. An agent cannot make inferences on content unless it can be effectively and selectively retrieved. Similarly, the results cannot be shared among other agents, learners, and teachers unless communications channels are robust and capable of overcoming translation, standardization, and time-synchronization problems. These applications are discussed below in terms of the major educational actors - students, teachers, and content. These applications are also described as agents. Though the difference between an agent and a simple network program is somewhat arbitrary, they are usually distinguished by the degree of autonomy, human anthropomorphism, and the communication capacity (with both humans and other agents) of these programs (Franklin &amp; Graesser, 1997). Student Agents Early prototypes of student agents (Beer &amp; Whately, 2002; Thaiupathump, Bourne, &amp; Campbell, 1999; Thomas &amp; Watt, 2002) have focused on helping students overcome problems of scheduling and coordinating collaborative learning activities and of finding and retrieving information. An ESW agent can be distinguished from the class of animated tools used to enhance stand-alone computer-assisted learning that are often referred to as 'pedagogical agents' (see Baylor &amp; Kim, 2003). ESW agents can operate on a single machine, but they are more likely to be designed as network-centric programs utilizing the distributed affordances of the Semantic Web. Typically an agent is assigned a task by a learner and works on the networks with relative autonomy at that task until it is completed. A good example of a student agent is the l-Help system developed at the University of Saskatchewan (Greer, McCalla eřa/v 2001). Each student in the class creates an agent that is aware of its owner's capacity, interest, availability, and the cost of providing help to any other student in the class. When students require assistance, they launch their agent on a search of agents of other students who may be able to provide assistance on a particular problem. The agent locates a suitable source of help, negotiates a rate (in either real money or reward points), monitors the help given and received in e-mail exchanges, and then maintains a database of the perceived efficacy of the help obtained from the individual helpers. This system has worked in normal campus-based and paced educational models, but its potential is probably greater when used in unpaced, distributed environments or lifelong learning contexts, where the learner defines the learning goals and activities. Other applications of student agents focus on development of learner models that continuously respond to learner preferences, accomplishments, directions, and aspirations. These are then used by content providers to offer and customize learning sequences. Teacher Agents Teachers' agents will undertake a variety of tasks designed to reduce repetitive and time-consuming 6 EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/September-October 2004</page><page sequence="3">administrative functions associated with teaching; helping teachers remain current as to discipline and pedagogical developments in their fields, and in creating and monitoring student learning activities. Many will remember the still futuristic "Knowledge Navigator" promotional video created by Apple in the late 1 980's. The video demonstrated the capacities of an attractive, voice-activated, personal agent acting as research assistant, secretary, and confidant to a busy university lecturer. Some researchers have argued (Dowling, 2002; Nowak, 2004) that such anthropomorphic representation of agents increases their efficacy, but doubtlessly different descriptive and functionality needs have to be evolved and tested with individual users to confirm what form(s) these teacher agents will take. They will evolve, however, to respond to both voice and text input and output as dictated by the circumstances and preference of the users. I look forward to the day when my teacher agent notifies me that three students have not accessed the learning management system for the past four days, and asks politely if I wish to send my usual "we are missing your participation" letter. Completing such a routine task with current tools is time-consuming and not personally rewarding to busy teachers. Content Agents Although it may seem rather futuristic to conceive of content itself as having volition and capacity to change, update, and augment itself, such capacity is growing exponentially (Kurzweil, 1999). Increasing capacity of machines (Moore's law) coupled with increase in their capacity to create linkages with other content and humans (Metcalfe's law) give rise to a vision of educational content that communicates and negotiates with other content to continuously update itself. I have argued that these increasing competencies will result in a substitution of teacher-learner for learner-learner interaction and student-content interaction (Anderson, 2003). Student-content interaction (as in reading textbooks) has long been a feature of educational provision that maximizes student capacity to learn at a pace and time most convenient to their busy lifestyles. Content agents will serve to increase this flexibility and provide customization. Negotiation with learner models provided by individual and group learner agents allows content to display itself in response to individual learning styles, languages, individual understanding, and prerequisite student knowledge. An example of such a content agent could be a Website that accumulates real-time data from climatic, economic, or social databases, and displays and analyzes this data in graphical or other formats appropriate to individual learners. Such rich pedagogical tools allow learners to participate in authentic learning experiences as learners and later as practitioners. In sum these affordances of the Educational Semantic Web can be leveraged to create much richer learning environments than those available today. However, like all technological developments, these benefits are also associated with challenges. Challenges of the Semantic Web Coherent and Complete Ontologies In order for information to be searched, retrieved, and inferentially manipulated by machines, it must be presented in formally defined and machine-readable structures. Our early experience with attempts to tag even simple, stand-alone learning objects illustrates the challenges of describing content in a single, standardized format. Downes (2004) has argued that such a goal is unattainable, and instead of working to identify and describe an object according to a single standardized description (the goal of the developers of the IEEE Learning Object standard), we need to create multiple, distributed learning object profiles that continuously change according to the use of the objects. McCalla (2004) argues that such profiles should evolve ecologically and automatically in response to actual use by learners. Such demands are challenging, especially as one considers the multiple contexts, cultures, and uses within which global education must effectively function. Attempts, especially those of the Cycorp's CYC project, at creating a single ontological organization for everything continue and have begun to spawn concrete applications (Masters &amp; Gungordu, 2003), but the promise is still greater than the products. Nonetheless, efforts such as those of the IMS group and those implementing the SCORM specifications are important to determine the practicality, best practices, and costs of tagging. Such experiences allow us to calculate cost- benefits through re-use - not only of learning objects but of learning designs as well. Privacy The rash of spam and other misuses of the information commons has highlighted our aversion to net-based applications that abuse our privacy. Paradoxically, learner profiles must contain enough information to form the basis of customized learning sequences by large sets of educational resources (Simon, Dolog, Miklos, Olmedilla, &amp; Sintek, 2004), yet they must restrict access so as not to leave learners vulnerable to systematic invasion of their privacy. What is needed are systems in which trust is selectively (and automatically) given and withdrawn in response to behavior, reputation, and explicit referral by other trusted entities. A necessary step is to insure that learner profiles are accessible and editable by their owners, and that individual learners are in control of their EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/September-October 2004 7</page><page sequence="4">profiles across multiple educational suppliers and experiences. Access Access has long been the defining feature of those providing distance educational experiences. The so- called 'digital divide' remains a challenge, especially in those countries with little access to educational resources. However, the promise of m-learning (Keegan, 2002) to provide access to learning situated in the real problems of active learners (Nyiri, 2002) foreshadows a world in which the Educational Semantic Web is available to all - anytime/anyplace. Resistance to Change In his response to the J IME online special issue, noted distance educator Greg Kearsly decried the inability and lack of incentives for education systems to effectively incorporate educational technologies of any description - much less those with the complexity and change potential of the Educational Semantic Web. These changes, however, will be propelled by learners who have grown up in a world of digitized devices, and they will seek out and use those educational services that are capable of meeting, in efficient ways, their educational needs. There will be many educational institutions that, due to resistance to change and the burden of previous' success with older education models, will not be able to make the transition to the ESW. I hope that it will not only be private and for-profit institutions that successfully meet this challenge. Certainly, professional educators must do their utmost to insure that their institutional organization models and especially their professional faculty associations are not hindrances in this drive for very significant changes in the way that education opportunities are produced, managed, and delivered. Implications of the ESW Today As the ESW doesn't really exist today, it is difficult to suggest how one designs educational content to take advantage of it. However, instruction today can begin to envision and prepare students by taking into account and building into educational programs activities that utilize the three affordances of the ESW. It is no longer reasonable nor realistic to think that students' learning resources are confined to the text or assigned readings. Individual search, retrieval, filtering, and authentication of net-based information should be assumed and demanded of all courses. Only by being challenged to develop these new skills will students be exposed to the challenges, benefits, and risks of learning using the ESW. Secondly, effective learning for both campus and distance learning creates opportunities for students to communicate, using multiple modalities with other students, with practicing professionals, and with globally located learners - whether or not they are enrolled in the same courses. These communications techniques include search and participation in blogs, discussion lists, real-time messaging, Wiki's (Web-based publication tools that allow collaborative editing of the documents), and social computing networks. Using agents routinely is still in the future, but students and teachers can be challenged to use, support, and build first-generation semantic structures (such as learning object repositories), expressed in formal structures, that reflect underlying educational ontologies and that are readable by both humans and machines. Conclusion We are currently at a "chicken and egg" impasse where there are few ESW applications because little information or communication tools are formally structured in sufficient specificity to allow machine retrieval, analysis, or inference. Paradoxically, there is little incentive to create these structured data reposi- tories, because there are few applications to justify the expense of the necessary formal structuring. Nonethe- less, steady progress is being made, and the annual Semantic Web conferences continue to present new models, prototypes, and applications that point to a world in which semantic processing of ;ur accumu- lated knowledge is both accessible and more importantly essential to maximizing learning effective- ness. □ References Anderson, T.

Educational Semantic Web Resources Events The Second International Workshop on Applications of Semantic Web Technologies for E-Learning: This workshop was designed to discuss the current problems in e-learning from different perspectives, including those of Web-based intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive hypermedia courseware, and the implications of applying Semantic Web standards and technologies for solving them. The workshop ran in conjunction with three different conferences in the summer of 2004. The workshops were coordinated by Lora Aroyo, Eindhoven University of Technology, and Darina Dicheva, Winston-Salem State University. The proceedings from all three workshops are available at: http://wwwis.win. tue.nl/SW-EL04/ The International Semantic Web Conference is held annually, and proceedings are published online. The conference focuses mainly on computer and information science issues, but commercial and educational applications are beginning to be noticed in the programs. The third conference takes place in Japan in November of this year, sponsored by the Semantic Web Science Society (http://www. iswsa. org/). Books and Articles Sir Tim Berners-Lee's 1999 book, Weaving the Web: Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web by Its Inventor , and his influential 2001 Scientific American article introduce the rationale and vision of the Semantic Web.

Aaron Swartz's Semantic Web in Breadth at http:// logicerror.com/semanticWeb-long is a concise overview of the technologies of the Web, including XML, ontologies, schema, logical proofs, and more. The 2004 Special issue of the Journal of Interactive Media in Education (www-jime.open.ac.uk/) focuses on the Educational Semantic Web: Visioning and Practicing the Future of Education. Articles include general overviews (Anderson, Stutt); overviews of technologies (Koper); problems and potential solutions to the metatagging problem (Downes, McCalla, Alert); and workplace applications (Simon, Collis). Ali Jafari's 2002 article, Conceptualizing Intelligent Agents for Teaching and Learning (http://www.educause. edu/ir/Hbrary/pdf Zeqm0235.pdf), provides an overview of agent applications designed to aid both teachers and learners in maximizing the efficacy of educational encounters. WebSites and Portals The Semantic Website at the WC3 (http://www.w3.org/ 2001 /sw/) provides listings of the latest specifications, publications, presentations, and activities of the leading development and tool groups associated with developing the technologies of the Semantic Web. SemanticWeb.org (http://www.semanticweb.org/) pro- claims itself as the Semantic Web Community Portal, but the news hasn't been updated in about 14 months. Despite this concern the annotated links from this portal are many, and we hope that the site will soon regain an active presence. SchemaWeb (http://www.schemaweb.info/) provides an aggregation of news related to the Semantic Web as well as blog references and a comprehensive calendar of events related to schema development and the Semantic Web.
