<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews PHILOSOPHICAL ESSAYS ON DANCE edited by Gordon Fancher and Gerald Myers. Brooklyn, NY: Dance Horizons, 1981. 166 pp. Paperback, $8.95. During the summer of 1979 the Ameri- can Dance Festival sponsored a series of six public lectures by philosophers. Each lecture was followed by discussion led by a panel that included at least one phil- osopher, one critic and one choreog- rapher. This book contains the six lec- tures and a transcription of much of the discussion. The lectures raise a fairly broad range of issues, and inclusion of the discussion adds considerably to the book's liveliness and interest. The book could serve as a brief introduction to some of the issues in contemporary phi- losophy of dance, either for the general reader or as a classroom text. The six philosophers whose lectures are printed are Noel Carroll, Marshall Cohen, Maxine Greene, Gerald Myers, Thomas Wartenberg and Paul Ziff. The other participants are Laura Dean, Senta Driver, Lucas Hoving, Deborah Jowitt, Anna Kisselgoff and Marcia B. Siegel. Gordon Fancher has written an introductory essay that contains a clear and accurate summary of the lectures and discussion. In his essay "Do You See What the Critic Sees?" Gerald Myers argues that to appreciate dance one must be able to see movement quality-the aspect of movement characterized by words like "fluid," "tight," "brittle," "restrained," "liquid," "ragged" and "wooden," for example. Myers contends that move- ment qualities "are the essential percep- tual elements in the appreciation of dance." Knowledgeable viewers are able to see qualities of movement that the in- experienced viewer has difficulty seeing, Myers says, but as the novice gains ex- perience he or she learns to see move- ment qualities and other things he did not see before, sometimes by having a critic point them out to him. Not just the novice, but all of us "constantly learn from dance critics how to see perfor- mances in enriched ways." For persons to see the same movement quality what is required, Myers argues, is shared ex- perience and training. "To see alike," he says, "to notice the same simultaneous and successive movements, requires a similar mind-set." But this is not to say that such qualities are subjective. Myers argues that difficulty in per- ceiving qualities of movement and dis- agreements even among experienced viewers about whether a certain quality is present might tempt one to suppose that when we use terms such as "brittle" or "expansive" we are not really refer- ring to qualities objectively in the dance movement but rather to our subjective response to it. Myers rejects subjectiv- ism, however. He distinguishes different forms of subjectivism and rebuts each; then he offers additional arguments for the objectivity of movement qualities. None of the discussants seems to disagree with Myers's critique of subjectivism, nor do I. What is more controversial and needs more explanation is Myers's ac- count of how and to what extent viewers can achieve precision and intersubjec- tive agreement in characterizing move- ment qualities. In "Post-Modern Dance and Expres- sion" Noil Carroll tests the theory that an essential ingredient of dance is ex- pressiveness by examining post-modern choreographers' attempts to create works that are nonexpressive-dances that "are meant to show nothing above and beyond the specific movements em- ployed in making the given dnace." Car- roll distinguishes three senses of expres- sion: in the "narrowest" sense what gets expressed is an emotion such as joy, an- guish or terror; in another "narrow" sense what gets expressed is a quality analogous to a trait of personality or bearing such as wit, charm, majesty or aloofness; and there is a "broader" sense in which what gets expressed is an atti- tude or idea-e.g. Jooss's The Green Table expresses the view "that the she- nanigans of plutocrats cause wars whose wages are paid by the common people." Carroll analyzes Yvonne Rainer's Trio A as an illustration of a dance intended to be nonexpressive. He argues that al- though it is clearly not the sort of dance that (either represents or) expresses emo- tions like joy or anguish, it and other post-modern dances do, inevitably, ex- press certain attitudes. Trio A, for exam- ple, expresses an "anti-illusionist position on the nature of dance." Carroll's point is that "each dance is sedimented with dance history. A dance is seen as a choice vis-a-vis a tradition and as a response to it." Therefore any dance can be seen as expressing an attitude of either accep- tance or rejection toward certain pre- vailing practices within a tradition. Post-modern choreographers, then, have eliminated expression in the narrowest sense (expression of emotion) but not in the broadest sense (expressing an attitude). But what about Carroll's other sense of expression (expressing qualities such as charm or aloofness)? He argues that once a work is seen in relation to a tradi- tion with practices that it either accepts or rejects, the work acquires anthropo- morphic qualities associated with that acceptance or rejection. By eschewing emotion, Trio A, for example, acquires certain "broadly anthropomorphic" qualities, according to Carroll; "in com- parison with dances in the Graham tra- dition, its reductive choices make it 'fac-~ tual' as opposed to 'emotive,' 'cool' as op- posed to 'impassioned.' " Paul Ziff in "About the Appreciation of Dance" argues that one should resist whatever temptation there might be to think of dance as a language: "it lacks the appropriate syntactic and semantic structures requisite for a language. It has syntactic and semantic structures ade- quate for a symbolic system," he says, "but not for a language." Ziff's concern is not just to argue this point, however. Rather, he uses his discussion of the syn- tactic and semantic elements of dance to raise some questions about dance appre- ciation. In considering the syntax of dance, Ziff argues that at least two diffi- culties beset one's forming a critical eval- uation of a dance. One difficulty is knowing that you have seen the same dance twice; another is knowing wheth- er you had a reasonable perspective on the dance, since what you see from one spot may differ considerably from what you see from another. Considering the semantic level of dance, Ziff points out that "the signifi- cance of complex movements is not a simple function of the meanings of its constituents. It doesn't build up recur- sively in the way linguistic elements build up." We can recognize and appre- ciate the expressiveness of dance move- ment, Ziff argues, even though we can- not fully analyze what gives the move- ment the expressiveness it has. And "someone sensitive to the expressive as- pects of the dance can serve to make it clear to others," he says, "can help others notice things they didn't notice and attend to things they didn't attend to. And for that reason," he says, "we need very good critics," but "you mustn't suppose there should be any- Dance Research Journal 16/1 (Spring 1984) 51</page><page sequence="2">thing like a complete analysis." Thomas Wartenberg's essay is titled "Is Dance Elitist?" He contends that, yes, ballet at least is objectionably elitist in the sense that its vocabulary and char- acteristic movement qualities reflect the ideals of grace of an aristocratic class ex- clusively, and therefore ballet implicitly endorses that class's view of itself as su- perior in matters of behavior and decor- um. The discussants greet this theory with appropriate incredulity. It seems to me that Wartenberg has simply not es- tablished that balletic movement has the aristocratic associations he claims for it. His essay and the ensuing discussion are instructive though; for one thing, several distinct senses of elitism get distin- guished, and that clarifies the general issue of elitisim in art. In "Primitivism, Modernism, and Dance Theory" Marshall Cohen argues that "the theory of modern art tends to- ward two sharply contrasting ideals." According to the modernist ideal, the most significant art works "are those that do not dissemble the artistic medi- um in which they are created, or do not trespass on the domain of other artistic media." The other ideal, often associat- ed with some form of primitivism, is syn- thesis; "It looks to an art that will draw on the most potent resources of all the major artistic media." Cohen argues that "neither primitivism nor modern- ism in the formulations with which we are most familiar provides an accurate account of dance as we have inherited it or as we prefer it." He examines in some detail "the two most elaborate philo- sophical discussions of dance to appear in English in recent years"-the theories of dance propounded by Susanne Langer and by David Levin. Cohen argues that primitivist ideas have misled Langer and modernist ones have misled Levin to very similar misrepresentations of dance; both theories understate dance's physicality. Cohen sees his ex- amination of Langer's primitivism and Levin's modernism as a contribution to "an assessment of the larger body of ideas with which they are associated. And an assessment of modernism and primitivism is," he says, "a central task of contemporary aesthetic theory." In this collection of essays, Maxine Greene's "Aesthetic Education and the Dance" is an anomaly. It is mainly ex- hortation and rhapsody rather than argument. Greene urges a recognition of the need for what she calls "aesthetic education." By this she appears to mean that since what we are able to perceive is partly conditioned by what we know, conceptual knowledge enhances appre- ciation of dance, or of any art, and even the most rudimentary appreciation of an art requires some understanding of its methods and conventions. Unfortunate- ly Greene does not elaborate this idea in any useful or informative way. On the contrary, she obfuscates matters by in- voking, by assuming-without argu- ment, as if it were widely held and un- controversial-some sort of theory of aesthetic perception. However, that theory is never clearly articulated. Jack Glickman SUNY-Brockport KAJA AND KELOD: BALINESE DANCE IN TRADITION by I Made Bandem and Fredrik Eugene deBoer. Kuala Lumpur: Oxford University Press, 1981. 191 pp. $59.00. Kaja and Kelod is the first major ency- clopedic work on Balinese dance to ap- pear since Beryl de Zoete and Walter Spies published Dance and Drama in Bali in 1938. The latter was one of a spate of distinguished works written on Bali in the thirties. The world was be- coming aware of the island just as it was enjoying a period of intense artistic ac- tivity that, according to Bandem and de Boer, had begun in the 1890's. Western scholars and artists responded to the arts of Bali with passionate descriptions, painstaking research, and important methodological breakthroughs, includ- ing reliance on native "informants" and personal experience to collect material. They also deplored the troubles that contact with the outside world had set afoot in Bali's harmonious, insular culture. Fifty years later, I Made Bandem and Fredrik deBoer see their collaboration as synthesizing Balinese and Western points of view. Their cross-cultural co- operation is an optimistic model not only for work in their own field, but for all kinds of efforts in an increasingly intra- dependent world. In the text one result of Bandem and deBoer's approach is the way they call on Western disciplines to aid in the explication of a dance. One dance needs a sociological or an anthro- pological explanation, another demands an historical perspective, another can be understood in terms of dance and dra- matic performance technique. Because international communication and travel are widely accessible now- adays, Bandem and deBoer assume their reader may visit Bali and will at least have seen Balinese dance in films, on television, or in live performances by touring companies. In their introduc- tion, they invite the reader "to visit Bali and see the dance there in its appropri- ate context." As indicated by the title, the structure of the book is based on a traditional Bali- nese principle. In Balinese "kaja" means "toward the mountain," or in geograph- ical terms, toward the mountains in north central Bali where the gods live. "Kelod" means "toward the ocean," par- ticularly off Bali's south coast, where demons rule. In between is secular space, that is, the inhabited land that stretches from the mountains to the sea. The kaja-kelod axis is used as an organ- izing principle in other situations as well. For example, the authors say that it is applied in the design of temples, individual family compounds, and en- tire villages. The authors adopt the kaja-kelod scheme to order accounts of sacred and semi-sacred dances, secular dances, fear- ful magic dances, and at the low end of the scale, tourist performances of vari- ous dances. The reader's path through the book thus leads from the most kaja inner sanctum to the outer courtyards of the temple, out into the village, through dangerous sites like crossyards and graveyards, past modern stages set up for tourist shows, and ends literally off the scale in the most kelod place possi- ble, among the flashing lights and gyrat- ing bodies of a discotheque constructed below sea level in the basement of a hotel on the south coast. The authors make use of the proven logical strength of the kaja-kelod axis just as Balinese choreographers accept traditional dance forms as the starting point for new choreography. Within in- herited structures are known to be infi- nite possibilities. With the kaja-kelod axis as their guide, Bandem and deBoer are not only exceptionally thorough and ac- curate, they are also particularly good at delineating the compositional relation- ships among the many historical and modern Balinese forms. This is one of the ways their book reaches beyond record-keeping and stimulates the read- er to further speculation or action. In their first chapter, the authors con- sider the wali, or most holy dances of Bali. They describe them as indigenous, originating from the Malayo-Polynesian culture that came to Bali between 1000 and 2500 BC with settlers from the Southeast Asian mainland. Wali dances take place in or start from the inner sanctum of the temple. The spectators interact with the dancers as appropriate, burning incense for them, supporting them physically, encouraging them, or 52 Dance Research Journal 16/1 (Spring 1984)</page></plain_text>
