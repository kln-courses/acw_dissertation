<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTICES OF BOOKS After an exemplary discussion of how Persephone's abduction has been interpreted since antiquity, C. uses a nuanced account of notions of fictionality and performance as a basis for his own approach to this and other stories, an approach which emphasizes the contextual-performative aspects of myth narration. When applied to the Demeter/Persephone tale (perhaps sung at the Eleusinian Games (54)), this approach is contrasted by C. with interpretations in terms of the death and rebirth of vegetation. He goes on to make the more general point that the very act of regarding a multiplicity of narratives about x as constituting 'the myth of x' predisposes an interpreter to reduce the anthropomorphic figures acting in such stories to forces of nature or cosmological ele- ments (52-3). If C. is right, we may need to for- give him at least some of those variations on the theme of 'what we call "myths"'. About Bellerophon in Iliad 6 (ch.2), C. is sub- tle and intelligent. The distinction between 'the myth' and 'this narrative' is fruitfully developed, e.g. in relation to the absence of Pegasus: mention- ing the wonder horse might have risked evoking Bellerophon's hybristic flight to Olympus (86). On the theme of initiation, C. plausibly argues that it can get us part of the explanatory way (the break with the world of adolescence; the over- coming of monsters 'on the margins'; the eventu- al accession to royal power), but it cannot explain everything: after all, Bellerophon does not return to Greece to achieve reintegration and eventual dominion; his grandson Sarpedon will actually fight against the Greeks (82). Ch.3, on Pythian 11, enables C. to point out all the 'indices discursifs de l'enonciation' (personal pronouns, allusions to the performative context, etc.) in which the genre abounds (99). He also analyses the conundrum posed by the ode: how does Orestes' murderous vengeance relate to a young Theban's Pythian victory? Noting the refer- ences to blame as well as to praise, C. observes that this poem, like the genre it belongs to, reorients epic values to the ethical standpoint of the fifth- century citizen. In the conveying of this message, darkness as well as light has its role to play. To exemplify the 'mise en discours' of tragedy, C. chooses (ch.4) A. Suppliants and the genealogical narratives about Io in PV. This is a really superlative chapter; having read it out of duty as a reviewer, I went back and read it for pleasure. Particularly fascinating is the account of Io, Danaos, Belos and Agenor in terms of cen- tre and periphery (e.g. 120ff.); given the altera- tion between Greece and non-Greece which these interlocking stories involve, it is worth quoting C.'s completely persuasive observation on p.121: 'le pouvoir royal definitifne peut s'affirmer au cen- tre de la Grece que dans le passage par l'Egypte', i.e. the perceived cradle of civilization. Two more nuggets: (a) a full-blown initiatory explanation will not work for Io, since, although she becomes an adult through giving birth to Epaphos, she is not integrated into a household by marriage (127); (b) the Danaids' murder of their husbands is like a Flood, the regenerative Lynceus and Hypermestra being analogous to Deucalion and Pyrrha (132). The word 'poetique' in his title does not limit C. to poetry, since he is concerned with the fabri- cation of all kinds of stories. In ch.5 he looks at remodellings of Helen by Herodotus and Gorgias. I enjoyed this chapter less, partly because of the inelegant proliferation of narratological terms. The Bath ofPallas (ch.6) suits C. well since it raises questions about the hymn's performative aspect in relation to the Argive ritual which it evokes. C.'s careful account comes to the famil- iar conclusion that Alexandrine poetic mimesis has turned from the dramatic to the textual (195). The final analysis deals with part of Pausanias' account of Troezen (2.30-4). C. charts the complex narrative process whereby the Troezenians' land becomes political territory, and the no less complex spatial organization of the monuments, from centre to periphery, by which Troezenian religious topography is articulated. The discussion is mostly about the 'intra-discursif'; C. has nothing new to offer regarding the on- going debate about what audience Pausanias was writing for. When C. characterizes his approach as 'anime par une volonte sans doute un peu pedante de methode' (245), it is hard to disagree. Yet the learning and sheer acumen which he displays are worthy of the highest praise. RICHARD BUXTON University of Bristol HANKINSON (R.J.) Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought. Oxford UP, 1999. Pp. xiii + 499. 0198237456. As a philosophical digest R.J. Hankinson's Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought is something of a masterpiece. H. takes us through almost all of ancient Greek philosophy with chap- ters spanning from the Presocratics, through the 179</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS Sophists, Plato, Aristotle, the Atomists, the Stoics, Sceptics, Middle Platonism, Ptolemy and Galen to the Neoplatonists. The vast material is careful- ly resumed and succinctly analysed. A set of causal/explanatory principles provides points of comparison or contrast throughout (abbreviated as, e.g., PSR: 'Principle of Sufficient Reason' or PCS: 'Principle of Causal Synonymy', and help- fully listed in an appendix), allowing H. to plot large-scale conceptual developments and make some telling connections (e.g. on the relationship between the Phaedrus and Alcmaeon). On occasion, one may take issue with some of H.'s specific claims. For example, it seems dan- gerous to argue (387) that since Aristotle thinks that organisms are fine and noble because they have purposes, his concerns are not also aesthet- ic, at least in a sense he would recognize (cf., e.g., Metaphysics 1078a36 ff.). But, in general, the problems one might find with this book arise more from the project itself than its execution. H. says of his project in the Preface (vii) that 'it has developed into something more like a general account of what the Greeks called physike, the inquiry into nature, since I found it impossible to treat of the meta-theoretical issues of how the Greeks viewed the concepts of explanation and cause themselves without also considering the actual explanations and causes that they champi- oned (it also accounts for my ranging beyond the boundaries of natural science and into meta- physics)'. However, once H. has included in his brief actual instances of explanation, causal or otherwise, the floodgates are open for a consider- ation not just ofphysike and metaphysics, but also of other areas of philosophy (for which part of philosophy does not in some sense try to explain?) and, indeed, any other discipline that employs explanation. Indeed, H. does discuss not just other areas of philosophy, such as ethics, but also historiography, medicine, rhetoric, and astrology, sometimes, as in the case of medicine and astrol- ogy, very successfully, sometimes less so. (For example, in the case of historiography, no men- tion is made in the discussion by Herodotus of the question of different sorts of evidence, the muthos/logos contrast, explanations from general- ization, induction or analogy, whilst Thucydides only gets a look-in in the context of the chapter on the plague.) But why stop at these disciplines? Why not include tragedy and epic (a rich mine for thinking about human responsibility and agency, as Bernard Williams shows in Shame and Necessity (Berkeley 1993))? On the other hand, the sheer bulk of the material that is included occasionally makes for quite elliptical accounts (e.g. of the Stoic response to the Master argument, 252) and provides frustratingly little scope for H. to develop his own interpretations (e.g. of Parmenides, 33-7). The book is thus in a sense both too long and (dare one say it of a work run- ning to almost 500 pages?) too short. A related problem is a tendency to de-contex- tualize passages for the purpose of extracting, sometimes abstracting, explanatory principles. For example, in the brief account of Plato's Philebus (119-20), we are given the four princi- ples required to generate the sensible world but no indication of how and why these principles are introduced and developed in the dialogue. In the exposition of the Timaeus, we are told, amongst other things, that Plato 'implicitly relies upon an application of P4 or PCS [both explained]; what- ever is responsible for something's being fine must itself be fine' (110), but we are given little sense of why it matters to Plato to show that the kosmos could have been generated according to this principle. Given the pressure on H. to con- dense, the wonder is perhaps that he manages to include as much context as he does, but one is still left with the worry whether Plato's 'views' on explanation can be extracted in this way. Despite these reservations, I imagine that this work will be useful both for undergraduates and research students. With its clarity and concision it provides an excellent starting-point for anybody who wants to familiarize himself with the wealth and sophistication of Greek thinking about causes and explanations.

However, the word 'motion' as normally used does not apply to all and only those changes which are not the generation or destruction of a 180</page></plain_text>
