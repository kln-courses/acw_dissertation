<plain_text><page sequence="1">SENUFO MASK CLASSIFICATION A great deal of error and misinforma- tion exists in the literature con- cerned with Senufo craftsmen and the nomenclature and origins of Senufo masks. Because it has not been complete- ly understood that the Senufo consist of numerous subgroups, and that Dyula, who originated north and west of Senufoland, are found in significant numbers throughout the area, terms concerned with Senufo art and artists have unfortunately been drawn from several dialect areas and from another language family. Further misun- derstandings have arisen because of the varying origins of craftsmen groups. In addition, the sources of Senufo woodcarvings have not been made clear, nor have the users been properly iden- tified. The purpose of this paper is to point out the complexities of classifying Senufo art and to provide a basic, though admittedly incomplete, foundation for further classification and understand- ing. Aside from the literary sources that are cited, the information upon which this paper is based was collected in northern Ivory Coast from July 1973 to December 1975. Senari words used in the text are Dalir, the dialect of the Dalebele in the central Senufo area.' Senufo is a term that has been used in the literature to designate approximately one million people occupying an ex- tended area in northern Ivory Coast, southern Mali and western Upper Volta. Delafosse notes ten "tribes" of Senufo (1912, vol. 1:115) and twenty-seven "sub-tribes" (1908:23-24). Holas indi- cates fifteen geographically different subgroups (1966:15-16) and four occua- tional "castes" (1966:70) scattered among the geographical groupings. Welmers recognizes the Senufo as speak- ing two different languages, Senari in the south and Sup'ide in the north (1950); both belong to the Gur language family. He further breaks Senari down into twelve dialects (1957), while Holas claims thirty different dialects for all Senufo (1966:35-39). The following in- formation is concerned with Senari speakers. Historical events have determined habitation patterns of the various sub- groups of Senufo. In those areas least affected by past indigenous wars and away from well-traveled trade routes, villages are often small. In areas affected by wars and in the path of trade cara- vans, settlements are often large for rea- sons of defense and commerce. Larger villages also contain Dyula and Fulani. The Dyula are Mande-speaking Mus- lims, many of whom engage in com- merce. They are also farmers, craftsmen and religious teachers. The Fulani are pastoral nomads, but those who have settled among Senufo may care for Senufo cattle, or work as tradesmen and weavers. Ethnic groups engaged in non-farm- ing occupations are calledfijembele (sing., fiji6), which are commonly referred to as "castes" in the literature.2 It has been claimed that fijembele are of lower status than farming groups, but this is disputed by Holas (1966:127), though he main- tains thatfijembele are restricted to marry- ing within their own group. Glaze has questioned whether the term "caste" is appropriate (personal communication, 1972), and, indeed, it would not seem to be even if Berreman's less rigid criteria are applied, namely, hierarchical ar- rangement, endogamy, ascription and permanency (1960:120-127). There is no evidence that hierarchical arrangement offijembele and farmer groups exists, and the evidence in the literature for hierar- chical arrangement is the result of an in- complete understanding about the sanc- tions that fijembele employ to keep far- mers at a distance. Also, marriage re- strictions are not as rigid as the literature suggests. An analysis of genealogies col- lected in the field indicates that exogamy has been practiced for at least one hun- dred years, which is long before the im- pact of French occupation was felt. Exogamy is thus not the result of West- ern contact. Nor is occupation as rigidly prescribed as is noted in the literature. While mostfijembele are associated with a particular occupation, members of any 1 GBOGURUGI, BOUNDIALI-KOLIA AREA, USED BY THE KASEMBELE AS AN ENTERTAINMENT MASK. 2.

Fijembele do, however, make a strong effort to keep the secrets of their craft, utilizing supernatural sanc- tions against inquisitive non-fijib. On the other hand, members of one fijib may be accepted as apprentices by members of anotherfijio, though this is not common. The number, occupation and nomen- clature of the various fijembele are not clear in the literature, which is the result of confusing Dyula craft groups and Senufo fijembele. Discussions of craft groups in Senufoland can be found in Delafosse (1908:263), Vendeix (1934:627), Maesen (1948:139), Knops (1959:86), Himmelheber (1963:87), Goldwater (1964:12-13), Bochet (1965:638), Holas (1966:70-71), Glaze (1976:22-51) and Scheinberg (1977:5); however, most of these are incorrect in one way or another. It is necessary to differentiate between Senufo and Dyula artisan groups and to separate Senufo and Dyula nomencla- ture, as does Glaze. Dyula generally lump all artisans, with the exception of the Djelebele and Lorho, under the rub- ric Numu. Numu are of Mande origin and may be found as far east as western Ghana (Bravmann 1974) and as far south as Agnibilikrou in the southeastern corner of Ivory Coast. Although they are generally associated with blacksmithing, they often carve as well. There are sev- eral references to Numu in early French records housed in the Archive National de la C6te d'Ivoire in Abidjan (1908; 1914), where they are described as oc- cupying themselves with blacksmithing, carving, weaving, commercial trading and farming, but there is no way of knowing if the Numu so described were, in fact, Numu, or whether they were members of other craft groups. The pos- sibility exists that they were Senufo fijembele described as Numu by Dyula in- formants. In the central and western areas of Senufoland, Senufo differentiate be- tween five major artisan groups. One is the Kulebele (sing., Guleo), who also call themselves Dalebele (sing., Daleo). The men are woodcarvers and the women mend calabashes. Dalebele is the term used on the north-south axis from Mbengue to the Dikodougou area, while Kulebele is in more common usage on the north-south axis from San to Ouezoumon. Non-Kulebele in the latter area are not familiar with the term Dalebele, though Kulebele are. To the east (Mbengue to Dikodougou), non- Kulebele are familiar with both terms. Dalebele state that they speak Dalir, a dialect of Senari unique to them. Kulebele in the west speak the dialect of the farming groups in the area and claim they have difficulty understanding Dalir when they initially encounter it. De- lafosse states that "koule" is a Mande term for woodcarvers (1912, vol. 3:118), and the word has found current usage in much of the literature. However, since it is not used by the woodcarvers them- selves, it seems more appropriate to use Kulebele, which is more widely recog- nized throughout Senufoland than is Dalebele. Dalebele and Kulebele recognize a common progenetrix and claim they originated in what is now Mali. There is evidence that the most recent migration occurred at the end of the eighteenth century, when a male ancestor of the San Kulebele migrated from Segou. Kulebele in the northern part of the western axis still have contact with Kulebele in Mali, and the style of western Kulebele shows a great similarity to Bamana and even Dogon carvings. Scheinberg (1977:5) states that Senufo carvings in the north have been influenced by Bamana and Bobo work, but in the case of western Kulebele, it appears that they brought their style with them when they mi- grated. In contrast, Dalebele have lost contact with carvers in Mali and were apparently already in Ivory Coast when the Segou-to-San migration occurred, a hypothesis supported by their distinc- tive dialect and carving style. Kulebele and Dalebele recognize kinship to Fonombele, the blacksmith group, with whom their reciprocal term of address is 67</page><page sequence="3">6 KODALI, A KULEBELE PORO MASQUERADE REPRESENTING A LION.

They also insist that they are not Senufo. Both woodcarv- ing groups have Poro societies, though those in the west are largely inoperative because of lack of personnel. All woodcarver Poro dance the same types of masks (with a few exceptions) and use the same costumes, dances, orchestras, and music, which are unique to them. Fonombele (sing., Fonon), blacksmiths, form another major artisan group. Where there are Kulebele in the neighborhood, Fonombele carving activities are restricted to wooden parts of basically iron tools (e.g., hoe handles, knife handles) (cf. Glaze 1976:31). In areas where Kulebele are not found, however, they also carve masks and statues. The women weave baskets and funeral mats. Fonombele also claim to have originated in Mali, but there is no evidence of direct links to Malian smiths among the Fonombele in the Korhogo area. They claim a common female ancestor with Kulebele, with whom they use the reciprocal term of address, fononyene, but they do not call woodcarvers Fonombele. Glaze notes a group of blacksmiths south of the Dikodougou area who are called Sungboro (1976:24), but their origins, whether or not they carve, and the craft speciality of Sungboro women, if they have one, are not discussed. A third group is Kpeembele (sing., Kpeo), which is the Senufo term for Lorho, who are brasscasters. Lorho is the Manding word for Kpeembele, who are not woodcarvers as Holas states (1966:70). Rather, the men cast masks, jewelry and charms using the cire perdue method. While Scheinberg states that they work with copper (1977:15), the major part of their work is in brass. The women are potters. According to Glaze (1976:16), the Kpeembele speak the language of their 68</page><page sequence="4">neighbors and originally had Poro, but in the Korhogo area they speak Dyula and are Muslims. Another craft group is Djelebele (sing., Tcheo), who are leatherworkers of unknown origin who speak a language unique to their own group. Djelebele women grow tobacco and greens. Traditionally, Djelebele had Poro, but they are rapidly becoming Muslimized, with the exception of those in a few isolated villages. Tchedumbele, who are also called Fahabele, Sindumbele and Shagibele, depending upon the dialect area, is the last artisan group. In the Korhogo area and south, they are gunsmiths and blacksmiths. North of Korhogo, they are weavers and carvers, and to the west, they are engaged in weaving, gunsmithing, goldsmithing, carving and trading. The women are potters. The origins of the Tchedumbele are unknown, but they were in the western area before Kulebele migrated there. Indeed, they were hosts to Kulebele when the latter first migrated to Kolia and Zanguinasso. These five fijembele are the largest artisan groups in the cen- tral Senufo area and are recognized by the general Senufo population. Numerous smaller fijembele exist, but they are often not known beyond a small area. There are four sources of Senufo carvings: Kulebele/ Dalebele, Fonombele, Tchedumbele and individual farmers in areas where none of the three fijembele is found. The style of the Kulebele is similar to that of the Fonombele, while that of the Dalebele, which will be dealt with in a future paper, is distinctly different. Presumably the carvings in collections and publications that are identifiable as Senufo, but are not in the style of the Kulebele, Dalebele or Fonombele, have been exe- cuted by Tchedumbele or farmers, but there are no data on the last two sources of carvings. Masks and statues are used in Senufoland in several differ- ent contexts. The most important users, in terms of volume and variety, are the secret societies, of which there are at least three different Senufo types, as well as Dyula societies. Only Senufo societies will be discussed here. The secret society complex that is the most universal throughout the area is the Poro. The term Lo, rather than Poro, has been used in some of the literature (Vendeix 1934:640; Lem 1949:24; Himmelheber 1960:98; Goldwater 1964; Lewis 1968; Scheinberg 1977:5), but the people in the central and western portions of Senufoland use the term Poro, as do Clamens (1951; 1955), Kulaseli (1955), Bochet (1959; 1965), Holas (1964; 1966:146; 1967:78; 1969:26), Thiam (1966:26) and Jamin (1973). Glaze notes that the term Pondo is used by the Fodombele, a farmer group south and east of Korhogo, but she otherwise uses the word Poro (1975; 1976:123). Knops uses the term gpo-oro (1959:94), which is curious because there is no gp phoneme in Senari (cf. Welmers 1950:128). Lem notes that Lo and Do are interchangeable terms (1949:24); Bravmann discusses a Do masking tradition in west- ern Ghana (1974), but this society is clearly very different from the Senufo Poro. Segy is the only writer to separate Poro from Lo, and he attributes some Senufo art forms to Lo and others to Poro, though the basis for his discrimination is not known (1969:171-175). Glaze states that Lo is the Dyula equivalent of Poro (1976:185); thus it is altogether possible that there are Lo societies in some parts of Senufoland, but it is doubtful that they function in the same manner as Poro. Not all groups living in Senufoland have Poro, but among those who do, the organization and purposes are very much the same even though the ritual paraphernalia and ceremonies vary from group to group. Membership in Poro is obligatory for all male members, and women are excluded until they are post-menopausal, though young women and girls participate - GALLERY K, INC.

INC SeirMme AmrcnScey0fApasr 69</page><page sequence="5">in some of the public ceremonies sponsored by Poro (cf. Glaze 1976:75). Poro are headed by the chiefs of maximal lineages and are structurally important in the political and economic organization of lineages. The purpose of Poro is not to inte- grate members of several lineages, or ethnic groups, within a village. Indeed, most villages have more than one Poro, and as Glaze states, they "are direct expressions of ethnic identity" (1976:104, 181). It is not unusual for political and economic conflicts between lineages to be manifested by conflicts be- tween their Poro (Richter 1977:77-80). Among the various subgroups of Senufo and fijembele who have Poro, each has its own ceremonial complex, which in- cludes masks, statues, costumes, musical instruments and or- chestras, music, dances, protocol and rituals. Further, within the Poro of any one subgroup or fiji&amp;, there are numerous sections, each of which is basically similar to the other, but variations may exist between sections of the same subgroup (cf. Glaze 1976:291). For example there are twelve active sec- tions in the Kulebele Poro, each of which is headed by the chief of a maximal lineage. All Kulebele Poro sections dance two types of face masks, but they differ in detail from one section to the other. One section also dances a fiber mask, called koidali, of the type illustrated in Glaze (1976, pl. 32, right), and another section uses a fiber lion mask, also called kibdali (Fig. 6), as well as a very large wood face mask, which will be discussed here in more detail. When a Poro mask is carved, a second, identical one is often commissioned so that if the first, and ritually consecrated, mask suffers a mishap or is stolen, the Poro will have an im- mediate replacement. Spare masks are often never danced and may not even have holes around the edges of the face for the attachment of head cloths. Neither face nor helmet masks of this type may show evidence of use. These masks do not con- tain any supernatural forces because they are not sanctified unless it is necessary to use them. Another context in which masks are used in Senufoland is women's societies. Glaze notes that among the Fodonon, the women have a secret society called Tyekpa, which, she states, is the "counterpart to the men's society (Pondo) in Fodonon culture" (1976:111-113), but it is not clear how this society articulates with the politico-economic structure of the lineage.3 Glaze does not mention that that the Tyekpa society uses carved wood masks. She does note that Fodonon women may "own" masks, which are danced by Pondo initiates (Glaze 1976:169), but says that these masks are "Sandogo-related." Thus, it ap- pears that the Tyekpa society does not use masks, but Fodo- non women who belong to the Sandogo may be mask owners. Sandogo is a further context in which masks are used, but it is very different from Poro. Sandogo is "concerned with safeguarding the purity of the matrilineage" and with divina- tion (Glaze 1976:82). Only women may belong to the first cate- gory of Sandogo, but men may become members of the di- vinatory category. Glaze notes that in the Kufulo area, where she did her research, Sandogo membership "is either through kin group succession . . or through the direct intervention of the python-messenger or the bushspirits" (1976:83). However, Sandogo is not universal among Senufo groups. Kulebele in the central area do not have Sandogo, though in the western area they do. There is evidence from the areas north and west of the area in which Glaze worked that individuals may con- tract with ndebele (sing., ndao), bush spirits,4 from whom they learn the secrets of healing and divining, without becoming ANNOUNCING THE OPENING OF A NEW WEST COAST AUCTION HOUSE FOR PRIMITIVE ART PRIMITIVE WORLD AUCTIONS gallery will offer six auctions yearly, with both mail and floor bidding.

There is also evidence that some of these persons learn dances that are imbued with supernatural powers from the ndao with whom they have entered into a reciprocal relationship, and some male healers and diviners wear masks as a part of their dance paraphernalia. To date, there are no data on the types of masks that are used in this context, but we are apparently dealing with two categories of personnel: those who are members of Sandogo, are diviners and may "own" masks that are danced by Poro initiates; and diviners and healers who are not members of Sandogo and who, if they are male, sometimes dance masks. A fourth type of secret society among Senufo has voluntary membership and an organization independent from the politi- cal and economic organization of any lineage. The only exam- ple of this type of society is the Wambele, though it is possible that there are others. The Wambele is found primarily among the Nafara (also called Nafana), who are located east and southeast of Korhogo. Wambele is a "sorcerer's" society whose members are greatly feared. Men and women are equally active in Wambele, and both own the helmet mask associated with it, although only male members dance the masks. According to Kulebele, women have been chiefs of Wambele in the past. Wambele is not limited in membership to Nafara; anyone who is willing to pay the initiation fees and undertake the training may join. The Wambele dance two types of helmet masks, both of which are zoomorphic and are called wanugu (wa, to sting, pierce;5 nugu, head). One mask is janus-faced and the other has a single face with long antelope horns extending behind it (Fig. 2). Both masks have small containers on the crest, often flanked by a pair of chameleons. A final type of masking tradition in Senufoland is not as- sociated with any of the organized societies I have noted. These are masks used solely for entertainment purposes, though they often perform at ritual funerals. Many are indis- tinguishable from those with ritual content when they are re- moved from their traditional context. Entertainment masks may be face masks or zoomorphic helmet masks, but they are not accompanied by the elaborate appurtenances of ritual masks. Masks-for-fun are paraded and danced by small boys, whose efforts are rewarded by small gifts of money and en- couragement by onlookers. They may also be danced or paraded by women in the privacy of small gatherings of kins- men and friends for entertainment purposes. Thus far, there is nothing in the literature concerning this type of Senufo mask, nor can any of the published pieces be identified as such. Figure 1 illustrates a mask of this type, which is a gbgiigRiigi (gbli, baboon; guRiugi, stumble, stagger-i.e., "go stumble with the baboons"). Children are called gbimbele (baboons), and it is considered particularly suitable that they be given a gbiiguiRugi for entertainment purposes. This particular mask is used only by the Kasembele, a farmer group in the Boundiali-Kolia area. Forms and protocols of masquerades diffuse from one Poro to another, sometimes as a single entity and sometimes inde- pendent of each other. As a result, two different forms may be called by the same term, or two similar forms may be given different names. For example, the koRobla mask and protocol originated with the Djelebele, both of which were adopted by the Senambele (also known as Tchebabele, Tchebara and Tiembara), a farmer group in the central area.6 Bochet places the origin of the koRobla in the Gbato area, which is southwest of Korhogo and includes Linguedougou (1965:660). Thiam claims that the koRobla, which is recognized as a zoomorphic helmet mask in the literature, is also used by blacksmiths (whom he calls Founoug), jewelers (whom he calls Fabele7) 71</page><page sequence="7">and Kulebele (1966:26). However, Kulebele do not have a zoomorphic helmet mask masquerade, and the mask of this type used by the blacksmiths in Glaze's 1976 study is called kunugbahla. Indeed, Glaze does not note any mask called koRo- bla in the Kufulo area. She does record three zoomorphic hel- met masks, each used by a different group (Fodonon, Fonon and Kufulo), and each called by a different name (gbon, kunug- baha and kponyungo) (Glaze 1976:310-311). The function of these three masks is very much the same, but variations occur in the appurtenances, and there are differences in detail in the form of the three masks (cf. Glaze 1976:308, pls. 44, 45; 319, pl. 22; 324, pl. 46). Other names occur in conjunction with zoomorphic helmet masks. Kulebele note a gbegbo, which they claim is a Kpeembele mask, and Bochet illustrates a gbodiugu, a gblige and a wanugu (1965). It is probable that Bochet's gbodiugu is a contraction of gbon and nyugu (head). Thus, the name is the same as Glaze's gbon, but the mask forms are different. Himmelheber notes a gbelegle, a mundiala and a korobla, all of which are from the Boundiali area (1960:103-104.) Bochet's gblige and gbelige and Himmelheber's gbelegle are undoubtedly the same name, but these masks also differ in form. An analysis of mask components in Table 1 (see p. 94) makes it clear that helmet masks cannot be identified by form alone. Senufo helmet masks have been referred to as "firespitters" in the literature (cf. Goldwater 1964:17; Lewis 1968; Segy 1969:173), which, in most cases, is incorrect. Kientz reports a Fonombele zoomorphic helmet mask south of Korhogo that "spits" fire (personal communication, 1975), but Glaze does not note firespitting as a feature of zoomorphic helmet masks in the Kufulo area. One Senambele koRobla (see no. 1 in Table 1, p. 94) in Korhogo walks through fire and extinguishes small fires with its hands. It also does splits over small fires and extinguishes them with its crotch. The other Senambele koRo- bla were not seen manipulating fire in this manner. Djelebele claim that their koRobla walks through fire, and indeed, this ability resulted in conflict between a Djelebele Poro and a Senambele Poro. According to Djelebele informants, they had lived peaceably with the Senambele in the village of WayiRi since time immemorial, but when the Djelebele koRobla per- formed its firewalking feat at a Senambele funeral, the farmers became jealous. The Djelebele Poro refused to divulge the sec- ret of firewalking to the Senambele, and the farmers chased them out of the village and across the river, where they have lived ever since. Clearly, "firespitter" is not an accurate generic term for Senufo helmet masks. Kulebele maintain that kponyugu is a term that encompasses all zoomorphic helmet masks, a taxonomic device supported by Bochet (1965:648). Perhaps kponyugu would be a better term in spite of the fact that the Kufulo use it as the name for a specific masquerade (Glaze 1976:324).8 Not all kponyugu manipulate fire, and neither are the various specific names by which they are called unique to helmet masks. For example, a Kulebele chief has introduced a koRobla into the mask inventory of his Poro, but the form is not related to the Djelebele and Senambele koRobla. The only feature the Senambele and Kulebele koRobla share is a bulging, prominent forehead. The Kulebele example is an anthropomorphic face mask, approximately 45-50 centimeters in height, with large ears, beneath which are carved wood antelope horns in bas- relief. On top of the mask is a carved wood container, which is also adorned with antelope horns.9 The costume, dance and addition of freshly cut foliage are similar to some of the be- haviors and appurtenances of zoomorphic helmet masks danced by other groups. The Kulebele koRobla was considered such a success by other Kulebele Poro sections that two of them have commissioned the carver of the first Kulebele koRo- bla to carve a similar mask for them. The difficulty of classifying Senufo face masks is much the same as that encountered when attempting to classify helmet masks. Kpelie is the term most commonly used in the literature though Glaze objects to it on the grounds that it is the French version of kpeli-yehe, which is interpreted as a carved wood face mask. As Glaze points out, kpeli-yehe is not a masquerade type but is the component of several different masquerades, all of which have different names. However, since identification of the specific masquerade of which a face mask is the compo- nent is not possible once the mask is out of context, perhaps kpelie is useful as a generic term, as Bochet suggests (1965:667).1o Indeed, while Kulebele use the name of the mas- querade when a face mask is in context, they use a dialectical variant of kpelie to note a face mask out of context. Glaze records three different masquerades in which a carved wood face mask is a component: kodili-yehe, which is Fonom- bele (Fig. 8); poyoro, which is Fodonon; and kotopitya, which is a "Sandogo-related" Fodonon masquerade. The face masks used in these three masquerades share the following formal features (Glaze 1976:167): an oval human face, often slightly smaller than life-size; geometric projections that flank the face symmetrically, which Kulebele call yafahafai ("something that is made"); a pair of tubular shapes flanking the face below the yafahafai, which Kulebele call gotchegele ("chicken thighs"); and a crest that surmounts the forehead and is sometimes flanked by horns. Masks meeting these criteria are also used by Senambele in the Korhogo area and by all Kulebele Poro. The Senambele masquerade that includes a wood face mask is THIRTEEN is proud to announce for the second year THE'iEtn I OLLETiON TELEVISED KUCTION OF ART INN INTTIOUES MIIM 110412,1173 You are invited to support this highly successful auction event.

The Senambele kbrihko is a Poro mask that is used within the funeral and initiation context and should not be confused with a similar face mask used by Senambele as an entertainment mask (Bochet 1965:668; Glaze 1976:185). The Kpatobele, farmers in the Ouezoumon-Gbemou area, also use the same type of kpelie (Fig. 4), but it is worn over the face rather than on top of the head. Thus, six different groups in Senufoland have been re- corded as using the same type of kpelie, and there are un- doubtedly others. It has been claimed in the literature that the crest on face masks is specific to the group that uses the mask, but this is inaccurate (cf. Glaze 1976:168). The crest that has been identified as "palm nuts" (Goldwater 1964:15), and which, in fact, represents the thorns of the bombax (kapok) tree,11 is found on all Kulebele kpelie (Figs. 3, 5), on at least one Fonombele kodbli-yehe (Fig. 8) and one Fodonon poyoro in the Kufulo area (cf. Glaze 1976:340), and on Kpatobele kpelie (Fig. 4). The female figure or head as a crest is used by such diverse groups as Fonombele and Fodonon (Glaze 1976:340), Senam- bele and Kpatobele. The female motif as a crest is also found on a Kulebele koRobla (see note 9). Table 2 (see p. 94) illustrates the problems inherent in de- termining the provenance and nomenclature of Senufo carved wood face masks. Bochet states that wood face masks are either korrigo or koddalu and can be identified by the type of head cloth worn by the masker (1965:668-669). However, Glaze discusses a kodbli-yehe (yehe, "face") and a kwiibele-kodili (1976:169-170), and although the term kodili appears in both of the masquerade names, one has a wood face mask and the other has a fiber mask. Indeed, several fiber masquerades are called dialectical variants of k6dali, such as the Fonombele kwobele-kodili, the Djelebele koddali (Fig. 7) and two Kulebele k6dali, one representing a lion (Fig. 6) and the other resembling the kurutaha fiber masquerade described by Glaze (1976:297- 298, pl. 32). A final problem in classifying Senufo masks arises from the fact that the forms of masks are not immutable, and when they are replaced it is possible that there will be stylistic and featural differences between the old mask and the new. Stylistic differ- ences occur between carvers, and the features deemed neces- sary for a mask to be effective can be represented by a variety of symbols. For example, single-faced kpelie are currently being danced by all Kulebele Poro, but prior to the early 1950s at least two of their Poro used double-faced masks. A similar situation exists among the Kpatobele, who have used both single- and double-faced kpelie. Thus, the difficulties inherent in categorizing Senufo masks embrace several areas. First is the ethnic identity of the creator of the object. Second is the ethnic identity of the users, which should provide a clue to answering the third question, which is concerned with nomenclature. Also, more work is needed concerning the symbolism of the mask iconography and the process by which symbols are selected, which is determined by the users, not the carvers. At this point, it is not possible to accurately identify most of the Senufo masks in collections where there are no data on the original collection point. It is necessary to document each mask individually rather than to accept general statements and terms that may very well prove false for any given mask. I suspect that attempts to classify Senufo masks on the basis of form will prove futile, and that classification can be realized only after content is un- derstood. The key to classification, therefore, is function, not form. Indeed, even Kulebele are often unable to identify masks out of context.

I also thank Anita Glaze for allow- ingme touseoneof herphotographs, which will beincluded in her Art and Death in a Senufo Village, soon to be published by Indiana University Press. 1. Consonants and consonant clusters have been Anglicized in the text. Final vowels are articulated. The orthography for vowels is as follows: a as in at, e as in bet, i as in fish, o as in so, ii as in ought, u as in boot; It is a glottal stop and R is flapped as in the Spanish pero. For technical reasons, African Arts has substituted 3i for the open o symbol, and R for the flapped r symbol; these are the nearest equivalents in standard type. Tones and nasalization are not indicated. It will be noted that there are differences between Senari words in Glaze's work</page><page sequence="10">and mine, which are due to the fact that we worked in different dialect areas. Further, though I was primarily in the Kiembara dialect area, my principal informants were Dalebele, whose dialect differs from Kiembara. 2. Cf. Delafosse 1908:263-266; 1912, vol. 1:115-118; Vendeix 1934:627; Maesen 1948:139, Lem 1949:17; Knops 1959:86; Himmelheber 1960:94; 1963:87; Goldwater 1964:12; Person 1968:57; Gardi 1969:125; Scheinberg 1977:5. 3. It is difficult to see how the women of any matrilineage could cooperate as a corporate group since the Fodonon are virilocal. This problem is overcome, in part, in Poro by the practice of sending some male children to live with the mother's brother. Ideally, all male matrikin should be mem- bers of the same Poro section. 4. Madei and madebele in Glaze (1976:95), who notes that madebele is also a generic term for all figurative sculpture among the people in the Kufulo area south of Korhogo. The Dalebele generic term is tugu, which simply means "statue." 5. Senufo believe that Wambele members use bees as messen- gers to deliver death, which is accomplished when the bee stings the victim. 6. Albert Kientz, who did his research south of Korhogo, collected this same oral tradition (personal communication, 1975). It appears that the term koRobla has a deeper meaning than has been realized in the literature and is more than simply the name of a specific type of mask and masquerade. At a Senambele funeral near Korhogo in 1975, a kuto-type mask (cf. Glaze 1976:279-302; pls. 22a, 31, 34) performed what was called koRobla by Senambele elders. At the same funeral a zoomorphic helmet mask also performed, which was also called koRobla.. 7. Kulebele state that the Fahabele is another term for Tchedumbele. 8. The Kufulo term is kpolnyiugo. The difference between kpionyungo and kponyiugu is dialectical. The etymology is the same for both terms. 9. Two Kulebele koRobla were stolen from Korhogo in the late 1960s and presumably have found their way into private Western collections. I saw this mask perform only twice and was not permitted to photograph it; therefore it would be very much appreciated if any reader who knows where one of these masks might be would write to me. It is not my intention to try to have them returned; Kulebele have re- placed them. The forehead of the mask has a prominent bulge and may or may not be covered with fine-line incising in a parquet pattern (see drawing a). The nose is large and possi- bly hooked. The mouth protrudes noticeably. There may or may not be a labret carved in the lower lip. Teeth are probably a prominent feature, and the eyes are bulging. The ears are large, high on the head, and almost surrealistically por- trayed. Below each ear is a wood antelope horn carved so that the twists are apparent (see drawing b). A small bowl-shaped container surmounts the mask. The container is incised verti- cally and is decorated with antelope horns (see drawing c). There may be a human head or figure (or some other feature?) on top of the container. The mask may not have much patina- tion because one of them was a spare mask. It is possible that these masks have not been identified as Senufo. a b c 10. Bochet uses the term gpelihe (pl., gpelye) and points out that it should not be confused with gpelige, which is a helmet mask (see Table 1). Again, the use of a gp consonant cluster is peculiar. 11. Bombax thorns are represented on zoomorphic helmet masks in the form of conical, vertically oriented teeth. The palm nut, when represented, is the small ovoid nob on the forehead.
