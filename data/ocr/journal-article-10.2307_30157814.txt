I Narrative arises from human finitude, shapes it in the act of storytelling, and transcends it in its contribution to memory as tradition, that which can be passed on and mined for meaning. Telling stories is essentially human, like play, thought, language, laughter, and tears; and each story is a unique blend of the universal, formulaic, expected and the individual, singular, original. Sto- ries draw on our experience and knowledge of the world and, whether artlessly Monatshefte, Vol. 100, No. 4, 2008 534 0026-9271/2008/0004/534 a 2008 by The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System</page><page sequence="2">Surveying Narratology 535 told or forming the core of a literary text, they call up a context of tradition and convention, be it in allegiance or breach. How, then, does narratology address this human invention and archive of human invention, especially as a contribution to literary studies? It is not always clear whether the study of narrative illuminates the power of a story or text or seeks to domesticate it by subduing uniqueness via classification. Structuralist narratology, which was instrumental in the ascendancy of narra- tive studies from the 1970s on, has a tendency to subordinate creative singular- ity and artistic originality to parallels, similarities, and recurring patterns in a privileging of formal parameters that has led to a proliferation of terms. The result can be an unproductive degree of terminological wrangling: is the nar- rator always, sometimes, or never a focalizer?' When talking about embedded narratives, is it best to stick with Gerard Genette's confusing "metadiegetic," to go with Mieke Bal's sensible "hypodiegetic," or adopt Schmid's three-level model of frames as primary, secondary, and tertiary?2 This tendency towards hyper-classification has not necessarily been superseded but complemented by more relaxed approaches that emphasize, for instance, the playfulness of working with narrative theory.3 On the other extreme we find radical chal- lenges to such key parameters of classical narratology as representation, the existence of clearly definable strata or levels, or the role of "voice" as "the secure foundation that assures the coherence of narrative geometry itself."4 Since the 1970s, the study of narrative has made great strides in three directions: first in the 'classical' structuralist development of a sometimes daunting amount of terminology with increasing sub-differentiations; then in moving beyond the confining frameworks of terminology; and simultaneously in branching out into an increasing number of disciplines as well as an array of theoretical, methodological, and ideological inflections. Enough of a devel- opment, that is, to engender a desire for stock-taking, and simultaneously to allow assessments of what the state of the art is. This essay presents a number of important publications that have recently contributed to such an overall as- sessment. Clearly, narratives are a major ingredient in the menu of scholarly occupations and the academic industry, and the significant number of intro- ductions, handbooks, and reference works in the area of narratology that have appeared in recent years5 both document and make claims for the status of the field: they serve as evidence that the study of narrative has arrived not only in terms of scholarly credentials, but also as a presence in curricula and the dissemination of knowledge to students. Three of the volumes under review (Abbott, Fludernik, Wenzel) are explicitly geared towards students at least in intent. Abbott-see below-is probably the most accessible; the Wenzel volume is strongly didactic in intent, providing definitions and 'how-to's'; Fludernik targets students, if not entirely successfully given the shifting levels of complexity and terminological sophistication in her monograph, although she has future scholars in mind as she points out lacunae of scholarship; and</page><page sequence="3">536 Sabine Gross Herman and Vervaeck acknowledge, in the context of the 'teachability' and the didactic potential of structuralist narratology, that with its aid, "students can be alerted to textual aspects that they might not have discovered all that easily otherwise" (103). Beyond documenting-and advancing-the status of the discipline, the small flurry of handbooks and introductions also reflects the changing reali- ties of the academic publishing scene in the humanities. Individual scholars purchase books selectively, while libraries are straining under budget restric- tions that disproportionally affect the acquisition of books (as opposed to jour- nals and databases, where the emphasis often falls) in the humanities. The volumes under discussion follow the dictates of the market by being either tailored towards use as textbooks or triggering library acquisition by the la- bel of "handbook," "companion," or "encyclopedia," along with the rapidly increasing number of such volumes in humanistic disciplines in general since the mid-1990s. But while these labels are more than occasionally misapplied in attempts to secure marketability, every single one of the six recent publica- tions discussed here fulfills its task well, and all of them can be recommended without hesitation. They range from elementary/introductory to highly sophis- ticated, and they variously provide procedural knowledge and/or overarching orientation. The volumes under review will be discussed in the following order based on their format. Both monographs (by Abbott and Fludernik, below part II) follow the design of a lecture series in their chapters, progressing from basic to more specific, although they do not mandate sequential reading. Of the two collaboratively authored handbooks (part III), one provides a chronological and one a systematic view of the field: Herman and Vervaeck tell the story of narratology, while Wenzel et al. survey its terrain. Finally (part IV), two very substantial multi-author reference volumes offer wide-ranging individual and independent articles (the Companion) and unsurpassed orientation via alpha- betized and cross-referenced entries (the Encyclopedia). Each of the volumes under review includes sufficient and often impres- sive coverage of the "usual suspects" in the concepts, models, and approaches presented: readers can expect reliable and competent presentations and discus- sions of fundamental narratological categories from the structuralist paradigm broadly defined, such as plot, story/discourse, characters, time and chronology, showing/telling, focalization, and the presentation of speech or consciousness (free indirect discourse, stream of consciousness, interior monologue). The following assessments will not dwell on these, but focus instead on variations, particular strengths (or weaknesses, of which there are few), and idiosyncra- cies of the individual volumes. Just as these recent guides to the field vary widely in format, style, and target audience, so does the scope granted, delineated, or claimed for the study of narrative. A comparison of opening or defining statements reveals both pro-</page><page sequence="4">Surveying Narratology 537 nounced distinctions and parallels in approach. Abbott's volume aims "to help readers understand what narrative is, how it is constructed, how it acts upon us, how we act upon it, how it is transmitted, how it changes when the me- dium or the cultural context changes, and how it is found not just in the arts but everywhere in the ordinary course of people's lives, many times a day" (xi). Herman and Vervaeck similarly emphasize the comprehensive nature of the subject as it extends from "the oldest myths and legends to postmodern fabulation": their introduction opens with the affirmation: "No single period or society can do without narratives" (1). Wenzel, in turn, confidently posits what sounds like a synthetic view of narrative, but actually places the parts before the whole: "Ein Erzahltext konstituiert sich-wie im Folgenden zu zeigen sein wird-aus Handlung, Charakteren, Raum- und Zeitstrukturen sowie aus spe- zifischen Techniken ihrer narrativen Vermittlung" (2, emphasis SG). Compare this with chapter headings in Abbott such as "Narrative and life" (chapter 1), "The borders of narrative" (chapter 3), "Interpreting narrative" (chapter 7) or "Narrative negotiation" (chapter 12), and the difference emerges between a technical-analytical and a much more holistic view. Wenzel's "Kompendium von Kategorien und Methoden" (3), as he calls it, is aimed at practitioners of Literaturwissenschaft interested in the "Analyse von Erzihltexten" (1) and aligns itself specifically with the ascent of narrative-i.e., prose-literature from the 18th century on, while Fludernik acknowledges the prototypical status of literary narratives, but also expands her focus to other acts of narration in the realm of everyday exchanges and pragmatic contexts, reminding readers: "das Erzahlen ist also eine gingige und oft unbewusste Aktivitat in der mtindlichen Sprache" (9). Her definition, while not contradicting Wenzel's, differs mar- kedly in its emphases: "Eine Erzahlung (engl. narrative, frz. rdcit) ist eine Darstellung in einem sprachlichen und/oder visuellen Medium, in deren Zen- trum eine oder mehrere Erzahlfiguren anthropomorpher Prigung stehen, die in zeitlicher und riumlicher Hinsicht existentiell verankert sind und (zumeist) zielgerichtete Handlungen ausfiihren (Handlungs- oder Plotstruktur)" (15). The Encyclopedia points to the "predominance of narrative as a focus of interest across multiple disciplines" and the corresponding need for a "com- prehensive reference resource [ ... i] that cuts across disciplinary specializa- tions to provide information about the core concepts, categories, distinctions, and technical nomenclatures that have grown up around the study of narrative in all of its guises" (x). The Companion's introduction, in turn, opens by ad- dressing the very question of how to introduce the volume with an extended metaphor of navigation and a brief exercise in self-conscious narrative that skirts "the ever-expanding whirlpool of self-reflexivity" (1). The editors of the Companion see themselves as "navigating between Scylla and Charybdis" (1) and ask readers at the outset to realize "that our navigational choices were not inevitable. You very well might have charted a different route" (2). While the Encyclopedia provides a road map with clear sign posts, the editors use the</page><page sequence="5">538 Sabine Gross identical metaphor when they express confidence that their orientational aids "chart several paths that readers might take through the Encyclopedia" (xi). Reading across the different texts proves illuminating beyond what any individual volume has to offer. One of the nice things about this recent cluster of publications is that readers may pick and choose according to their pref- erence, following either their inclination or selecting an orientation toward narrative they might be less familiar with. The differences in approach and scope (of definitions and of presentation) reflect continuing contests about terms and approaches. In Abbott's words, "there is not yet a consensus on any of the key issues in the study of narrative" (xii). This includes the question to what extent it constitutes a discipline, an interdisciplinary approach that is put to use in individual disciplines, or a trans- or metadiscipline-reminiscent of the discussions, a few decades earlier, of the relationship among linguistics, semiotics, and textual studies. The challenges of definition begin with the ter- minological coextension, distinctions, and boundaries among "narratology," "narrative theory," "narrative studies" or related terms, the question of which one would be most appropriate, and what precisely they denote. In his ar- ticle on "Erzihltheorie" in the 1997 overhaul of the respected Reallexikon der Literaturwissenschaft, Niinning quite rightly emphasizes the heterogeneity of the field; but beyond that, the role of theory as he describes it seems to shade into methodology and application in a focus on "systematic description," on Untersuchung or analysis of texts, and on the development of models of nar- rative structure.6 The degree of slipperiness is evidence of some confusion, but also of the undeniable overlap between theory as an abstract and overarching con- ception of a subject or field or advancing of a hypothesis, and analysis as the development and use of a methodology for that subject or field. Yet in recent decades-certainly in literary scholarship, and demonstrably in narrative stud- ies-the perceived cachet of "theory" (reflecting fascination, but also resent- ment and a difference in rank: "high theory" versus lowly analysis) has led to a somewhat inflationary overextension of the term's reach and a concomitant softening of definitory borders.7 Similarly, in narrative studies, other terms seem to have been largely preempted by "narrative theory" or Erzihltheorie, with a conflation and loss of referential precision. "Theory" not only tacitly subsumes analysis, but also eliminates possible equivalents for "narratology" such as "narrative scholarship," "narrative studies," or the more precise "nar- rative analysis," and it obscures an explicit focus on methodology-as if "Be- griffe, Modelle und Methoden" ("concepts, models, and methods," Wenzel 1) amounted to theory, and vice versa. Among the titles discussed here, Abbott's is the only one that circum- vents the question, and the author explicitly situates his inquiry on the level of the object toward which both theory and analysis are directed. Both the Companion and the Encyclopedia have opted for "theory," even though an</page><page sequence="6">Surveying Narratology 539 important component of the Companion is, in fact, textual analysis. Fludernik similarly offers "theory" in her title, then equates "Erzihltheorie," "Narra- tologie," "narratology," and "Wissenschaft vom Erzlihlen" (17). Her volume covers aspects of narrative theory as well as analysis and literary history. Her- man and Vervaeck commendably opt for "analysis" in their title, but they do so in a programmatic attempt at holding narrative theory accountable: they navigate somewhat uneasily between analysis and a provisional equation of narratology with "the theory of the narrative text" (11), while their intention, as detailed below, is actually on the contribution of narratological analysis to literary interpretation; and in fact their statement that "[t]heories of narrative are misconstrued if they insist on abstraction and lose touch with actual sto- ries" (1) itself partially misconstrues theory, whereas it is well taken if applied instead to forms of analysis. A similar conjunction is found in Wenzel, with the same equation of "Erzihltheorie" and "Narratologie," even though in title and stated purpose (1, passim), the appropriate and much more precise Erzihl- textanalyse is used for the "begriffliches" or "analytisches Instrumentarium" (1) his volume focuses on. II H. Porter Abbott's emphasis is neither on narratology nor on narrative theory, but on the fundamentals of storytelling as an anthropological rather than a more narrowly literary phenomenon, as both the title of his relatively slim Cambridge Introduction to Narrative and the first sentences of the preface (see above) confirm: "We are all narrators [and] the constant recipients of narrative," he asserts (xi), focusing on the broadest possible sense of "narrative" while acknowledging other, narrower senses of the term. This cheerful and generous acknowledging of other scholars' positions is one of the many commendable features of this engaging volume-Abbott is a trustworthy guide who lays out his reasons for the choices and positions he adopts, but invites readers to consider alternatives. His volume requires no previous knowledge whatsoever of its readers and is thus an introduction in the truest sense. Based on a course "The Art of Narrative," the volume comprises a dozen very readable chapters that would be well suited for a general introductory course on the subject over either a quarter or a semester. Abbott has retained the 'flavor' of the oral lecture with a dialogic quality and the impression of the author's 'presence' in the text; his text deictically engages readers in continuous references to "I," "you," and "we." Reader-friendly in a variety of ways, these lectures/chapters present their subject matter in very accessible form-they invite readers to follow along as Abbot develops thoughts and arguments, outlines terms and the difficulties they might entail, explains differences of opinion and contrast- ing positions, and occasionally offers detours (the running text is frequently segmented by marked boxes that contain additional material, questions, or</page><page sequence="7">540 Sabine Gross discussions of terms; the reasons for assignment to the boxes are not always obvious, although presumably they are to be considered less essential). The suitability for undergraduates and introductory teaching is the result of comprehensive knowledge, just as the references, intended not to overbur- den the text, are well selected. Each chapter ends with a brief annotated review of relevant secondary readings as well as additional primary texts one might wish to practice one's new-found skills and insights on. Abbott's presentation throughout is simplified in the sense of a reduction to essentials (with frequent elaborations), but rarely simplistic or trivial: it is clearly ajudicious distillation of many years of engagement with the subject, one that values common sense over terminological profusion. While referring to a catholic range of scholars, from Augustine to Derrida, Abbott aims to 'anchor' narrative in basic human impulses, such as the human "need to control the inexplicable through nar- ration" (75). He points out that "narrative gratifies our need for order" (38), notes "the enormous persuasive power of narrative coherence when wedded to human desire" (41), and he insists that "[a]s readers, we exercise a power over narrative texts that is arguably as great as their power over us" (79). Abbott's point of departure is the most elementary of definitions: "nar- rative is the representation of an event or a series of events" (12). He does not consider a narrator indispensable (13), not least because he also includes media such as drama and film that do not have a narrator in the traditional sense.8 Instead, features such as "narrator" or "causality" are assigned a role in what he regards as a sliding scale of "narrativity" (22f., 38) beyond the ba- sic status of "narrative." (Narrators do get extensive coverage in a chapter on "narration.") Following a somewhat more loosely constructed chapter on the "borders of narrative" that discusses features such as framing narratives, para- texts, hypertext, adjoining genres, and narrative hybrids such as role-playing games, chapter 4 ("Rhetoric of narrative") addresses causation, pointing out that "[t]he inevitable linearity of story makes narrative a powerful means of gratifying [our] need" to "look for the causes of things" (37). "Closure" is addressed at the level of both questions and expectations, a useful distinction. In comparison, the less than exhaustive discussion of "Sus- pense and surprise" as constitutive effects falls slightly short. Abbott relies heavily on the presence of an "implied author" and indeed posits what he calls an "intentional" reading-one that is oriented towards the implied author- as the result of avoiding both "overreading" and "underreading" (using Ker- mode's terms/concepts) even though here, as well, he is tolerant of both the latter reading practices. He does offer his own classification of interpretations as "intentional," "symptomatic" (this would include a range of "suspicious" interpretations or what is often considered "reading against the grain"), and finally, "adaptive" readings that take up a story while departing from it. The question of adaptation receives additional treatment in a chapter on differ- ent media possibly geared towards student encounters with 'classical' texts</page><page sequence="8">Surveying Narratology 541 and themes as presented in modern updates, films, etc. Throughout, Abbott frequently refers to cinematic narratives, in particular, in what may be a con- scious decision not to privilege traditional print media or the prototypical fic- tional prose narrative (of which he nonetheless provides numerous examples from different periods and languages). In general, he succeeds at bringing out the near-universality of narrative, even though his occasional attempts to align humanistic and scientific discourse sometimes fall short even if one accepts his basic definition of narrative ("the skeletal structure of narrative governs even the most limited patterns of stimulus and response" 123). A chapter on "char- acter and self"-here as elsewhere, Aristotelian categories are in evidence in modern garb-is followed by one on "narrative contestation" that could also be titled "narrative in the legal arena," with examples drawn from the historic Lizzie Borden case. And in the final chapter, Abbott draws on the myth of Oedipus as an instance of what he has called "masterplots" when he lucidly presents Aristotle's, Freud's, Propp's, and L6vi-Strauss's interpretation, both as instances of "narrative negotiation" and to illumine how narratives them- selves do negotiate conflicts, differences, and struggle in what Abbott calls "passionate thought" (158). In his closing remarks, Abbott explicitly returns to the insistence on "prevent[ing] the appropriation of a text to one monolithic meaning" (173) that has shaped his approach to narrative throughout. With Hillis Miller and others, he insists on an ethics of reading that "liberates readers to exercise their creative reading power in response to the full potentiality of narrative" (173). The useful glossary doubles as a topical index (a service it provides somewhat imperfectly: for instance, it does not allow the reader to locate refer- ences to the medium of film), and it is complemented by an "index of authors and narratives" (which lists authors followed by titles of texts, but films by title followed by filmmakers-initially confusing for readers, but in keeping with Abbott's comments on the compound nature of film 'authorship,' 78). The power of narrative on one side, the power of readers to respond cre- atively with wide latitude on the other: this is the less-than-technical overall conception within which Abbott manages to present his highly readable sur- vey of the major terms and categories encountered in the study of narrative. The author takes care to counterbalance 'high-cultural' texts with numerous references to popular culture (including improv comedy, 96). Abbott's attitude throughout is relaxed. His tolerance-entirely in keeping with the author's promise of a volume that is "descriptive rather than prescriptive"-is perhaps most conspicuous: Abbott continuously outlines options, different approaches, mentions alternative views, and insists on the diversity of readers and read- ings. His validation of the range of possible responses will encourage students to approach, engage with, and interpret texts. This stance appears to be less a post-classically radical questioning of narratological categories; rather, one imagines Abbott saying: "There's always more one can do, but here's how to</page><page sequence="9">542 Sabine Gross start." Besides being an appealing choice for beginners, his focus on narrative rather than narratology offers more advanced narratologists and those invested in the more technical aspects of narrative analysis a welcome broader view and a reminder of why humans tell as well as analyze stories. Monika Fludernik's Einfiihrung is intended for first-semester students of lit- erature at German universities-a target group significantly different from US undergraduates who might take their first course on literature and/or narra- tive-and based on "eine Vorlesung fuir das Studium generale" (8). Like Ab- bott's volume, hers offers 12 chapters (or, to be more precise, 11 chapters and an informative final section of advice for "budding narratologists"), a glossary of terms, and a bibliography. The glossary is useful, but has occasional gaps. Readers will look in vain for the "implied author," for instance, who makes repeated appearances in the text (79, 89, 121) and should certainly not be taken for granted as a concept. The bibliography has separate sections for primary literature (analogous to Abbott's annotated list of primary texts at the chapter endings) and secondary works. In addition to the standard names predominantly from English-language and French scholarship, the latter lists numerous studies and authors representing recent (but also 'classical' older) German scholarship on narrative or related fields, a rich tradition that con- tinues to be underrepresented in English-language publications on the topic, evidence of a continuing language barrier or one-way traffic in ideas-among others Friedrich Spielhagen, Karl Btihler, Giinther MUller, Kite Hamburger, and Eberhard Limmert. Since Fludernik works in English literature, much of her own work-cited liberally in the bibliography as well - has appeared in English. While the volume is the only one of the six covered here that lacks an index, the subheadings and keywords in the page margins are a useful orient- ing feature. Any introduction to narrative theory/analysis in German must face the comparison with the justly successful Einfiihrung in die Erziihlanalyse by Matias Martinez and Michael Scheffel (Mtinchen: Beck, 1999, with numerous reprints to date). Fludernik's volume is both more elementary (or, to be pre- cise, it devotes more space to elementary categories, while going significantly beyond them) and more wide-ranging compared with Martinez and Scheffel's closer orientation toward and more detailed presentation of a Genettian model, and in these respects a good choice for beginners. In addition, Fludernik's strong awareness and continuous thematization of literary history and peri- odization throughout should dovetail well with other introductory university courses by creating a horizon for students that includes literary-historical de- velopments. The first chapter, while surveying many of the same features Abbott presents, takes readers significantly beyond Abbott's opening chapter, places the narrator more centrally, begins to address the question of fictionality</page><page sequence="10">Surveying Narratology 543 (emphasizing fictional worlds over chains of events, 14), and arrives at a much more elaborate and detailed definition (see above). Where Abbott's recurrent theme is the power of narrative in human life, Fludernik traces the methods of narratology to linguistics (17), and she keeps a strong focus on the actual language of texts. Like other recent introductions or surveys of the status of narratology (cf. the first two chapters of the Companion), she also provides a succinct history and assessment of the field of narratology (chap- ter 2). A chapter on publishing practices and history, marketing, and other contextual features is of marginal relevance to the topic. Two rather demand- ing chapters (five and seven) supply close scrutiny of linguistic detail. One has concise and illuminating sections on the presentation of speech (80-83) and on stylistic variation (84-88); the other offers a microscopic analysis of the specific linguistic features that create the (fictional) world, including de- ictic markers that localize events and persons (including the reader) in space and time, different forms of reference via articles and pronouns, variations in the use of tense, and narrative stance and positioning including "experi- ments" (62f.). Here, Fludernik offers excellent material to sensitize students to the linguistic constitution of what they may be tempted to read simply for characters and plot--an emphasis that is also evident in a chapter on "Real- ismus, Illusionismus und Metafiktion," which squarely addresses the issue of fictionality, and, referencing Niinning, aptly distinguishes between meta- fiction and meta-narration in the establishment of textual illusion: "metanar- rative Kommentare k6nnen im Gegenteil den Illusionismus des realistischen Erzahltextes wesentlich stlirken" (75). A chapter on "Gedanken, Geffihle und das Unbewusste" ("Thoughts, Emotions, and the Unconscious") includes a persuasive assessment of the limi- tations of free indirect style, interior monologue, and stream-of-consciousness (often given an unduly high profile) as opposed to Gedankenbericht or (in Dor- rit Cohn's term) "psycho-narration" (95ff.). A terminological glitch should be fixed in subsequent editions: While the chapter title gets it right, the assertion that Freud coined the term "Unterbewusstes" (100) will make psychoanalyti- cally oriented scholars cringe; the term used by both Freud and Lacan (cited as well) is "das Unbewusste"/"unconscious," and the compromise of "Un(ter) bewusstes" (100, 101) is no improvement. This chapter dovetails with Ab- bott's "symptomatic" readings and closes with insightful remarks about how such readings antedate postmodern approaches in diagnosing ambiguities and indeterminacy in apparently realistic texts (102). As regards the terminological thicket of focalization, perspective, and point of view, Fludernik, a former Stanzel student, not unsurprisingly offers the most detailed comparison of Stanzel's "morphological" model and Gen- ette's grammatically oriented one. Her attempt to align Stanzel's organic and continuous Typenkreis with the separate categories (voix, mode, temps) that Genette offers in a combinational model will be welcome to readers familiar</page><page sequence="11">544 Sabine Gross with both as well as only one of these models. Fludernik offers a detailed and balanced assessment of the strengths and drawbacks of both (including a summary on page 117), and the remainder of the volume continues to use both models and sets of terms concurrently (in the glossary as well, cf. e.g. "Mo- dus" 176, "Perspektive" 177f., and other entries)-a balancing act that is both sensible and occasionally awkward. For "Perspektive," she additionally directs readers to Boris Uspenskij's comprehensive and complex model (116-17). In the re-valuation of "Perspektive" and reference to Uspenskij, Fludernik is in agreement with Wolf Schmid (in his Elemente der Narratologie, de Gruyter 2005) in going beyond the summary rejection of both "point of view" and "Perspektive" that generally followed the introduction of "focalization" by Genette and its elaboration/development by Bal and others (cf. 116). Literary history, which provides background and context throughout, is addressed explicitly in the chapter on "Geschichte der Erzihlformen," if by necessity only in thumbnail sketches. Fludernik's purpose is not only to move narratology beyond a free-floating interest in universals: in addition to setting the historical record straight for first occurrences of, e.g., free indirect discourse, second-person narratives, or unreliable narration, she asserts that both historical analysis and a look at other media may necessitate a revision or modification of the foundations and of traditional categories in narratol- ogy (125, 129). Specifically, her historical focus leads her to consider the distinction between author and narrator-sometimes considered sacrosanct in narratology-as fluid (see esp. 69, 72). One chapter is devoted to a necessarily brief, but informative, sample analysis of three texts to demonstrate the benefits of narrative analysis for the interpretation of literary texts-Kleist's Michael Kohlhaas, Storm's Der Schimmelreiter, and Norbert Gstrein's 1999 novel Die Englischen Jahre. The final chapter, "Ratschlige fiir heranwachsende NarratologInnen," includes in its advice a continuation of brief analyses of sample passages, along with an excellent capsule assessment of other standard works (153-155)-parallel- ing Porter Abbott's comments on secondary sources, but with a more specific focus on narratology, in particular on current and very recent works. A list of specific "do's and don'ts" presents annotated, and then improved, passages from student theses. The volume as a whole has a certain degree of stylistic unevenness and occasional editorial oversights. There are misplaced commas, syntactic oddi- ties, or infelicitous formulations ("Dariber hinaus erfilllt der Erzahler wertende Funktionen" 136; "Da der Inhalt dieses Romans nicht allen Lesern offenkun- dig sein diirfte ... " 146; "die gewijlbte Sicht der Figur" 119; "wobei sie [ ... ] Anlehnungen machten" 119) that would merit review and improvement for subsequent editions, as would instances of eccentric hyphenation in the En- glish texts on page 156. The expressed intention to provide an introduction for first-semester students is occasionally at odds with both style and content</page><page sequence="12">Surveying Narratology 545 in Fludernik's volume, beginning with the unnecessary degree to which the vocabulary is inflected towards English cognates ("inkludieren," "changieren" 162, "Evaluation" 138: "Gabriel wundert sich, ob er das nicht alles erfunden hat" 149). The style veers from impersonal and technical (cf. especially pas- sages in chapter seven) to colloquial. Another oddity is the alternation between the first and third person in Fludernik's references to her own work (the inclu- sion of which is certainly appropriate)-cf. for instance pages 122, 126, 130 versus 73 and 125. Much of this may be due to the conversion from lecture format to print, possibly undertaken in haste. At times, the sophistication of concepts (and cruxes involving them), the degree of Fremdwortlastigkeit, and the inclusion of relatively advanced terms without sufficient introduction is likely to baffle, if not frustrate beginners. The language is frequently technical, offering a fine degree of precision that, however, makes for demanding reading especially for novices. The discussion of the narrative function of metaphor and metonymy on pages 88ff. (with reference to Jakobson as "nattirlich klas- sisch" [90], an assessment probably not shared by first-semester students), including an intriguing sketch of how they shade into each other, is too ambi- tious for this volume, and due to its brevity remains cryptically assertive rather than being convincingly demonstrated. III The two handbooks among the volumes under review-parallel in their insis- tence on addressing texts rather than other modes and media of narrative-are in some ways complementary in their divergent styles and emphases. The handbook/introduction (it appeared under the title "Einftihrung" in a series of "Handbticher zum literaturwissenschaftlichen Studium") edited by Peter Wenzel is the result of an extensive collaboration among the co-authors. It reflects their background as instructors at a technical university, both in the collective work mode and in its aim to offer readers the closest thing to a set of instruments. A brief introduction is followed by eleven chapters, an extensive bibliography, a helpful index and list of illustrations. Every chapter, similar to Abbott, ends with a summary-conclusion (Fazit) and bibliographic recom- mendations; in addition, each has a "Toolkit" of guiding questions. An emphasis on binary, ternary, or multi-level differentiation and on precision in terminology, coupled with the conviction that didactic presenta- tion will lead to competent use of even the most complex set of terms and distinctions, has resulted in a densely informative, reference-studded text that reads quite differently from Abbott's and most of Fludemrnik's volumes. One conspicuous result of the authors' attitude and background are the almost fifty diagrams that attempt to impose order and Ubersichtlichkeit on the layers of terms. In his introduction, Wenzel states three functions for these visual mod- els (2): imposing theoretical order by showing central elements and making</page><page sequence="13">546 Sabine Gross their relations easy to grasp through formal clarity of arrangement; guiding the user in practical-analytical manner to recognize what levels, elements, or relations need to be analyzed and what terms to use; and finally, Wenzel claims, they lend themselves to critical-questioning mode, making theories "tiberprtifbar" (2) and showing possible contradictions and weaknesses-a function that, one has to say, is not strongly evident. The efforts of the authors to represent complex interrelations with vi- sual clarity are admirable, and for the most part, they succeed. Their effect especially on student readers can be double-edged: the number of factors and levels is sometimes daunting in the imperative for analytic classification that it embodies. A model of nested communicative levels with ten elements (12) is a challenge to apply even for seasoned narratologists. With respect to this par- ticular diagram of communicative levels, one would do well to heed Herman and Vervaeck's reference to the occurrence of "cross bonds," metaleptic trans- gressions across these levels (82). Their comment that the agents on "each side of the communicative spectrum [ ... ] do not necessarily mirror each other" (21) could be taken as a direct admonition to readers to distrust the convenient symmetry claimed and constructed (rather than reflected) by the model in Wenzel. But this is not to dispute either the Anschaulichkeit or the usefulness of the diagrams, which should appeal especially to visually inclined readers. Frequently, simpler and accessible models are followed by more elaborate ones, or variations and critical revisions (such as Jahn's and Cohn's responses to Stanzel's Typenkreis, 115-119) are indeed made anschaulich in graphic presentations. The volume has other strengths. The introductory chapter on overarch- ing conceptions of the narrative text lays out more clearly than any of the other volumes the two different models that guide narrative analysis, "Das Kommunikations- und das Zweiebenenmodell,"9 the first one focusing on the communication among author(s), narrator(s), and reader(s), the second uti- lizing the two levels of story and discourse and categories such as events, characters, etc. It is helpful to start with the distinction, even though the two models are usually (and here as well, eventually) combined. Along similar lines, the chapter on characters juxtaposes two approaches: viewing characters mimetically, as persons; or as textual constructs or (with Greimas) actants. As before, the end of the chapter reconciles both views. The chapter on narrative time is predominantly a summary of Genette. Otherwise, a chapter by Sven Strasen matches Fludernik in the detailed attention it devotes to a synoptic comparison of Genette and Stanzel (including geometrical/mathematical fea- tures, 118-19).1a An insightful chapter on the creation and breaking of illusion does not aspire to Fludernik's sophistication, but is more detailed. Several chapters offer emphases not found in other introductions or hand- books. One chapter addresses narrative space, using as point of departure Striker's three categories of "Gestimmter Raum-Aktionsraum-Anschauungsraum,"</page><page sequence="14">Surveying Narratology 547 for which the authors suggest the English terms "atmospheric setting," "scene of action," and "visual field" (70, with a diagram on 72), but also addressing "conventional," "symbolic," and "mythic" space. A chapter devoted to "Span- nung" presents an elaborate taxonomy of forms of suspense and ranges impres- sively from Burke's "sublime" to a sociobiological focus on the physicality of suspense, tension, and "thrill." Narrative beginnings and endings are likewise given an illuminating separate chapter, including a diagram detailing how con- clusions are marked on both the level of story and of discourse (172). In a way, the book takes readers back to the late 1980s and 1990s in its continuing emphasis on sorting and clarifying; a mention that early stages of work on the volume date back to the 1990s supports this impression (2). In keeping with this deliberate orientation, only the final chapter offers an Aus- blick towards "post-classical" narratology, and it subjects those approaches to a classificatory system that is certainly helpful in contrasting them with the structuralist variants, but also entirely classical in its confident imposition of yet another binarism, as evidenced by the table on page 230. The emphasis throughout is on applicability and on precise categorization, a demand that is extended to those postclassical approaches that supposedly elude or challenge such parameters. As Mike Petry, the author of the "post-classical" chapter, puts it: An important precondition for using these new approaches "dtirfte al- lerdings sein, dass sich die Ideen und Postulate der neuen ["post-klassischen"] Ansitze ahnlich gut in konkrete, handhabbare Kategorien, Methoden und Mo- delle fassen lassen wie die in diesem Band dokumentierten Grundannahmen der klassischen Erzihltheorie." (231, emphasis SG) The useful "toolkits" that conclude the chapters are indicative of this general orientation." With the ex- ception of the chapter on characters, all kits are dominated by classificatory and yes-no-questions rather than more open-ended or complex inquiries. The diagrams, as well, reinforce two underlying premises, and how use- ful one finds the volume will to a large degree depend on the degree to which one shares these premises: 1) that terminological distinctions and differentia- tions are almost without fail a good thing and 2) that such distinctions can be made with confidence, separating out categories in binary or multi-level ar- rangements. They are in harmony with the tenets of classical structuralist nar- ratology in general: their clarity and symmetry and the degree of classificatory detail tends to veil the extent to which they are idealizations, heuristic attempts to impose order on what is a complexly crisscrossed continuum of phenom- ena in any given individual text. The impulse here is to enforce "trennscharfe Oppositionen" (69) in the interest of analytical clarity, even though individual authors do acknowledge "dass es sich bei den Konzepten der klassischen Er- zahltheorie letztlich nicht um tiberzeitliche, wertneutrale und ideologiefreie Universalien handelt, sondern um weitgehend arbitrire, abstrakte Setzungen" (20), and that actual texts do not necessarily divide up neatly into the catego- ries offered: "Durch die binare Aufteilung wird eine Trennscharfe zwischen</page><page sequence="15">548 Sabine Gross den verschiedenen Funktionen und Bedeutungen [ ... ] suggeriert, die in der Realitat wohl nur selten anzutreffen ist." (85) So the book has a certain hy- bridity: while the whole presentation privileges and offers the tools of what is largely the classical structuralist mode, the authors do profess an awareness of the pitfalls of facile categorization and overly articulated models. They realize and repeatedly acknowledge, as Wenzel for one puts it, "[d]ie Notwendigkeit, die intendierte klare Zuordnung durch ein 'sowohl als auch' zu unterlaufen" (19) and the fact "dass sich die komplexen Relationen einer Erzlihlung auch im Falle dieses Modells nicht in Kistchen pressen lassen" (19). Thus the volume is poised in a largely unresolved contradiction between a confidently terminology- and classification-driven approach and the acknowl- edgment of its limitations. It is predominantly oriented towards establishing and teaching classificatory competence. The emphases of the volume-and this is one of the standard criticisms of classical narratology-are based on the assumption that tools, once developed, will find useful applications and yield useful knowledge, so that their development and deployment tends to take on an importance of its own beyond the possible insights into the text such tools might facilitate. Thus the numerous textual examples in the volume often serve to illustrate an effect after the categories of analysis or classification for it have been presented: gratifying no doubt, and useful as an opportunity to flex one's terminological and analytical muscles. But the results are largely driven by the means at hand, with analysis taking on a purpose of its own and the dimension of interpretation on a distant horizon beyond such analysis. Interpretation and acknowledgment of the heuristic value of analytical tools, on the other hand, are the guiding principle for the Handbook of Narrative Analysis jointly authored by Herman and Vervaeck, originally published in Dutch (2001) and subsequently translated by the authors. Their aim is to offer "(con)testable possibilities rather than take-it-or-leave-it solutions" (10), and to do so while placing the literary text first. "Literary prose," the authors assert, has "always been the starting point of the study of narrative" (1). Their ap- proach differs from the other volumes under review, in that they have selected two brief stories (by Dutch authors Charlotte Mutsaers and Gerrit Kroll), pre- sented in the three-page appendix, to which they refer throughout, rather than presenting an assortment of often decontextualized quotes for illustration, as is the general custom. Their engagement with these stories is in keeping with the danger they perceive in the structuralist "preference for clearly distinguishable levels that may be impossible to separate in practice, the hierarchical thinking that turns a text into an accumulation of layers" (104). Herman and Vervaeck present the story of narratology in three phases (and three corresponding sections): "Before and Surrounding Structuralism" (11-39), "Structuralism" (41-103), and "Post-Classical Narratology" (105- 175), followed by fairly extensive notes, a bibliography, and an index. (Like</page><page sequence="16">Surveying Narratology 549 Fludernik, they provide helpful section headings in the margins.) Their focus, as reflected by the chapter lengths, is on structuralism as a phase-certainly a useful phase, with structuralism consolidating a number of important topics "into an encompassing and hierarchical system" (39), as their fair and de- tailed assessment makes clear. But for them post-structuralist approaches are not a postscript, as with the Wenzel volume, but a logical development from and response to structuralist tendencies, to what they offer and exclude. It is impressive that within this chronological setup, the authors manage to give a comprehensive and coherent account of narratology; their text is engaging and readable and explicitly oriented towards the reader's experience. The degree of terminological density varies considerably. At times the authors do tackle questions of terminology in considerable detail, for instance when they correlate internal and external focalization with the distinction of the experiencing and the narrating I (73f.) in one of the subchapters of the "Structuralism" chapter; when they present McHale's seven kinds of con- sciousness representation (92ff.); or in their discussion of Fludernik's model of "typification" with its paradoxical doubling of authenticity and "forgery" in the presentation of characters' speech (94f.) in a section that addresses the question of mimeticism versus construction (an issue that recurs in various contexts in all volumes under review). At other times they manage to afford readers a real sense of the questions underlying the establishment of terms and concepts that occasionally end up obscuring-rather than illuminating-the kinds of inquiries that we may wish to pose to texts. This skill is most strongly in evidence in the remarkable introduction that perhaps should be required reading for all readers of the Wenzel volume: here (1-10), Herman and Ver- vaeck guide readers towards and through their sample stories. As they do so, they manage to 'mirror' as well as raise their readers' narratological curiosity without resorting to the sometimes daunting terminology at every narratolo- gist's disposal. What they do in the introduction is indeed to "formulate a num- ber of related questions. The rest of the book consists of the various answers to those questions" (1). One thing becomes clear: Herman and Vervaeck do not shy away from interpretation or retreat into the safe confines of an analysis that contents itself with classificatory precision and the demonstration of 'how to.' They wield the tools of narratology in the service of "contribut[ing] to an interpretation" (3), and they insist on the reciprocal relevance of narrative form and content: "Those [ ... ] reducing a story to content might just as well go to the movies or watch television because both of them can offer similar content" (7). But conversely, "[i]f narratology becomes a mere formalistic game [ ... ], then the contents of a narrative remain mistakingly untouched" (7). They stick to this program by always pointing out in what way the features they manage to make visible are relevant for the actual stories-presenting, as it were, the texts through a successive series of filters that open up possibilities, but do</page><page sequence="17">550 Sabine Gross not establish certainties, frequently reiterating that "[o]ne can never be sure" (6). They are, in short, much less intent on pinning down features of the text unambiguously. On the contrary: they show undecidability or ambiguities to be an important feature of the text's meaning, for instance when they point out for one of the stories the significance of the fact that it "often does not allow us to decide the position of the you-figure" (7). This programmatic attitude colors their view of varieties of empirical, social, or anthropological narratology as well-of approaches that they consider reductive since they "lose track of the text in the process" (104-05) because "a literary text is subordinated to a non- literary conception of a story. The literary nature is repressed and the actual text is pushed aside in favor of an abstract pattern" (105). Their position is thus in marked contrast to proponents of transdisci- plinary or intermedial narratology that would extend narrative analysis and universalize it to the fullest extent possible.12 As they sum up: "In striving for the disambiguation typical of the hard sciences, literary narratology might lose its relevance as a tool for the development of interpretations that ideally keep the complexity of a text intact" (105). Accordingly they select for inclusion in their survey of post-classical narratological approaches those that focus on the literary text, and whose insights they direct towards the stories at hand: mov- ing away from synthesis and hierarchy, undoing temporal and spatial order, embracing undecidability, focusing more explicitly on ideology, ethics, and gender (the latter is discussed extensively and with respect to a number of other aspects, 130-148), possible worlds, frames and scripts, and-a recur- ring and fundamental emphasis-the role of the reader. Where the Wenzel volume is oriented much more strongly towards the object-the text-and the tools that would allow us to deal with it, Herman and Vervaeck's orientation (coinciding most strongly with Abbott) is subjective, centering on the reader, her/his questions, experiences, possible obstacles and difficulties encountered. Where Petry (above) measures postclassical narratological approaches against the unambiguity and user-friendliness of structuralist concepts, for Herman and Vervaeck the situation is the reverse, as they state with optimism in con- clusion: "Perhaps, narratology is now based on fewer certainties than structur- alism had hoped for, but this is probably the reason why narrative theory has such great potential" (175). IV The final two volumes, again, can be seen as complementary while roughly matching one another; in page numbers (approximately 600 and 700-plus) and heft alone they are in a different class from the introductions and hand- books. Both the Companion and the Encyclopedia are comprehensive and substantial in terms of scope and number of entries, if quite different in their approach.</page><page sequence="18">Surveying Narratology 551 In the Companion, the contributions take the form of 35 essays/chap- ters. Following an introduction by the editors, the texts are arranged in four sections of between six and nine individual chapters, framed by a "Prologue" with three essays on the history of narratology and an "Epilogue" with two contributions that look ahead. Given the almost uniformly excellent quality of contributions (all original for this volume), singling out any of them is bound to unfairly slight the others. While each chapter is geared towards a specific narratological phenomenon, problem, genre, or medium, virtually all of them simultaneously negotiate the relationship between theory and analysis, engag- ing in what the editors have termed "theorypractice" (2): the large majority of authors demonstrate or test their assumptions and arguments using specific texts. The volume thus manages to be of interest to those looking for current assessments or new takes on such topics as the implied author (by Wayne Booth himself), unreliable narration (by Ansgar Niinning), self-consciousness in texts (Meir Sternberg), biblical narratology (David H. Richter), or narrative and law (Peter Brooks), on the one hand, while also pleasing scholarly readers and exegetes of a wide range of canonical and non-canonical texts. The scope goes beyond literary texts (for instance, in investigations of sound and space in narrative), and in theoretical terms, beyond established narratological signposts or cruxes: While the contributions to part I shed "New Light on Stubborn Problems," part II offers "Revisions and Innovations" of some of the usual suspects with a number of original takes; to mention just the concept of "path" with which Peter Rabinowitz complements the customary story/discourse dyad. Part III, "Narrative Form and its Relationship to History, Politics, and Ethics," moves not only into literary-historical diachrony and includes (perhaps surprisingly) the auditory realm, but also ventures further into non-literary texts-several contributions address forms of "lifewriting" or (auto)biography-and even to the "Collective Portraiture" of Mount Rush- more. Contributions to part IV are situated even more obviously "Beyond Literary Narrative" and indeed verbal artifacts. "Soundscapes" remain a focus, as no fewer than three contributions in the section address narrative aspects of music (including opera and the leitmotivic techniques of film music); but cinema and performance art are also included. The Companion, then, is intended not to represent a "state-of-the-art" snapshot of narratology in its current manifestations, but to intervene in and advance the discipline both by reassessments and forays into novel territory. The editors usefully situate the individual contributions in their introduction. Readers who decide to pick and choose will welcome the fact that each chap- ter has a separate bibliography. Research-oriented "Notes on Contributors" (x-xvi) are another welcome orienting feature, as is the twenty-page index that includes names, titles, and concepts (among them-testimony to its in- clusivity-the rather remarkable "adresseelessness"). In keeping with the format and orientation of the volume, the glossary (542-51) is less complete</page><page sequence="19">552 Sabine Gross and comprehensive than, e.g., those in Abbott and Fludernik; it is geared to- wards terms that play a role in the contributions, including a number of newly coined and occasionally idiosyncratic ones. Thus while one will not find "mo- tif, "masterplot," or "paratext" (all included in Abbott), "psychonarration," "mood," or "anachrony," it does list "motivation" (in the Russian Formalist sense), "mise-en-abyme," but also "auditory restoration," "auscultation," "ek- phonesis," "prosopography," "subnarratable" and "supranarratable," perhaps in an attempt to establish these neologisms as additions to the existing nar- ratological terminology. The glossary fits the volume in that both are most beneficial for readers already reasonably well versed narratologically and able to appreciate the balance of existing scholarship and new directions the Com- panion offers. The two initial chapters on the "Histories of Narrative Theory" (by David Herman and Monika Fludernik) provide an excellent overview. Reproducing the volume's dual emphasis on established knowledge and new explorations, they are complemented within the "Prologue" by Brian McHale's brilliant and provocative piece on the "(Im)Possibility of Narrating the History of Narrative Theory," which takes up Bakhtin's role in the theory of narrative and its history to sketch an agonistic dynamic in which structural and historical approaches each "[s]eek[ ] to contain its narratological Other" (65), leading to charac- teristic blind spots. McHale persuasively demonstrates how in each case the repressed returns to complete the picture; and one could take the inadvertent transformation of one of Bakhtin's titles, in one of the few typos in the volume, from Poetics into Politics (68, note 1) as a reflection of McHale's intervention in what are, in effect, the politics of narratology. The two final contributions, by Mary-Laure Ryan and H. Porter Abbott, harmonize with each other in that both address some of the wilder claims advanced in recent decades for the future development of narrative-such as the ambitions for success associated with hypertext narratives, virtual real- ity, MUDs (multi-user domains), or the variety of online games. While Ryan points out that narrative meaning will continue to be governed by constraints of linearity such as "the one-directional relations of causality, psychological motivation, and temporal sequence" and thus "cannot be freely created by the reader" (523), Abbott similarly, if more generally, situates readers in time by predicting that "the often wonderful developments in the technology of entertainment will continue largely to take place within constraints, narra- tive or otherwise, that give us the illusion that time itself has a shape and that somehow we are equipped to read it" (540). The Routledge "Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory" is an extraordinarily use- ful compilation of narratological knowledge that not only lives up to the am- bitious title, but exceeds its scope. While the original hardcover volume was priced for libraries-and librarians should consider it essential-the recent</page><page sequence="20">Surveying Narratology 553 reissue as a paperback, while not inexpensive, should secure it a place on many a private shelf. On three densely informative small-font pages (ix-xi), the in- troduction manages to provide a sketch of the development of the field, list important current journals, book series, and conferences, and give a preview of the exemplary way in which the information is organized and presented, as well as outline the rationale for the volume as a "universal research tool" for "the many disciplines drawing on concepts of storytelling and using methods of narrative analysis" as a "comprehensive reference resource" (x). The vol- ume fulfils that mandate admirably and does indeed "give a broad overview of paradigms for analysing stories across a variety of media and genres" (ibid.). Highest praise is due for the care which the editors have devoted to making the information presented alphabetically as multiply accessible as possible. Entries come in five different lengths, from 3000-word essays to "thumbnail definitions"; all but the shortest entries offer brief, well-selected and current lists of suggested readings; and individual entries are copiously cross-referenced. This is intelligent hypertext at its best, in book format. In addition, the volume offers three excellent "navigational aids" (xi) in the form of an alphabetical list of all entries, a list of the more than 150 contributors by name with an index of all entries authored by each, and finally a reader's guide that provides a very helpful thematically arranged overview of all entries. Ev- ery one of these helps readers with different backgrounds and search interests find easy access to the rich store of knowledge represented in the volume. In addition, there is an index of more than 75 pages. These are exceptional resources to make the encyclopedia, itself an exceptional resource to begin with, maximally useful. Readers will likely be surprised at the breadth of scope. Entries are by no means restricted to narrowly specialized narratological terms, which they of course include (sjushet, reality effect, paralipsis); many are concerned more broadly with literature and art (such as "allegory," "ekphrasis," "irony," "mise en abyme," or "slave narrative"), while others branch out into other disciplines ("alterity," "gender studies," "montage," "trauma theory"). The "Reader's guide"-with its tripartite listing of "Key terms and concepts," "Approaches and disciplinary orientations," and "Genres, media, and regional forms"-for instance lists approaches that include (this is a selection only) ethnographic, cognitive, feminist, computational, deconstructive, Marxist, natural, psycho- logical, rhetorical, and sociolinguistic orientations; under "xy and narrative," such terms as theology, philosophy, psychology, emotion, identity, media, medicine, and humor studies make an appearance.13 One would be hard pressed to find a single entry that is not up to the highest standard and provides state-of-the-art information, whether it be "ethi- cal turn" or "tall tale"; the editors have practiced outstanding quality control and assembled a stellar cast of contributors that includes a "who is who" of current practitioners. Thus, while there is excellent work by many junior and</page><page sequence="21">554 Sabine Gross lesser-known contributors, readers also find numerous authorities represented: Mieke Bal on "visual narrativity," Jonathan Culler on "logic of narrative," Ellen Esrock on "narrative visualization," Hayden White on "metahistory"- the list could go on. As a matter of fact there is considerable overlap among the Encyclopedia and other volumes under review-evidence that both the Companion and the Encyclopedia have managed to win leading practitioners as contributors. Abbott, Fludernik, Herman and Vervaeck, Phelan and Rabi- nowitz have all contributed to the Encyclopedia, some with multiple entries; two of the three Encyclopedia editors also have chapters in the Companion: and nearly half of the Companion contributors are also represented in the Encyclopedia. V Read together, the volumes under review complement each other in sometimes surprising ways. While there is of course substantial overlap in the areas and concepts covered, and partial overlap in approaches and emphases, readers consulting more than one of these guides will likely be intrigued by conspicu- ous divergences, but also struck by coinciding foci. Authors vary not only in the degree to which they (re)present the historical/chronological trajectory of narrative studies, but also in the emphasis they place on classical versus post- classical narratology, including which approaches they present under the latter heading, and how explicit they make their allegiance to one or the other. The volumes have different styles and goals: Abbott wears his knowledge lightly, sharing his enthusiasm and inviting the reader to join him on a route of discovery, while Wenzel's handbook displays a professorial insistence on mastering techniques and dispenses knowledge in an authoritative "teacher to student" mode, offering a wealth of material in precise subdivisions, diagrams, and well-segmented chunks. Where Wenzel is geared towards enabling stu- dents to wield terms competently, the Companion, on the other hand, expands the range of questions to be asked in, through, and of narratological inquiry. Yet another difference can be found in the stance towards interpretation: Abbott's reader-oriented approach, like Herman and Vervaeck's, is ultimately geared towards interpretation; Wenzel and his collaborators offer definitional precision while as a rule stopping short of interpretation, and Fludernik pres- ents narrative analysis as a useful tool for interpretation (witness the "applica- tions" in chapter 11). The differing degrees to which interpretation is accepted, embraced, or excluded (especially in more strongly empirical approaches) in narratology has a complement in the attitude towards the anthropomorphic elements that mark narratological terms and approaches. Abbott, not surpris- ingly given his general attitude, cheerfully embraces the human propensity to anthropomorphize. Herman and Vervaeck, while similarly inclined to- wards literary interpretation, display a rather pronounced ambivalence towards</page><page sequence="22">Surveying Narratology 555 anthropomorphism in distinct contrast to Abbott. When they point out that "the structuralist method is marred by serious problems," the first item on the brief list is "the anthropomorphous approach to the text" (103). While they men- tion forms of anthropomorphism in narrative ethics and feminist narratology (135) in terms that signal if not approval, then at least ready acceptance, they do warn against the "implied author" because "a theory that does use it might degenerate into anthropomorphism" (28), point out that structuralists "risk treating constructs of words as people" (70), and criticize the way in which structuralism frames "textual aspect[s] in all too human terms" (81) in the very categories of "narrator," "reliability" and "detachment" (81). Thus they do alert readers to the degree to which the implicit anthropomorphism conflicts with some of the central tenets of structuralism with its focus on the text and insistence on abstract classification. Hillis Miller objects to the same tendency for reasons that literary schol- ars should note with approval. He emphasizes how terms such as "point of view," "focalization," or "center of consciousness" "evade the fact that novels are made of words [ ... ], linguistic through and through" (Companion, 124- 25). Dan Shen similarly points to the relative neglect by much of narratology of the actual ways in which language is used in-and shapes-narratives (141). While most Companion contributors devote welcome attention to the language of the literary text, in general the significance accorded actual lan- guage use is indeed an area of considerable variation, as a comparative look at Abbott and Fludernik will demonstrate. Abbott-to whom we may well apply Hillis Miller's criticism-directs surprisingly little emphasis towards language. This is in keeping with the generality of his approach and his trans- medial view of narrative, but gives short shrift to what continue to be fairly central forms of narrative, orally or textually. Even his chapter on "rhetoric" largely divorces that topic from its foundation in language. It is more con- cerned with subjects such as the power of narratives, with "causation" and "masterplots"; and when Abbott returns to "rhetoric at work" in the final pages of the chapter in an anticipation of the topic of narrative contexts taken up again in the penultimate chapter, his choice of focus and text is not literary, but a sample newspaper article with its different interpretive/ideological slants. (Readers interested in how the oft-asserted power of narrative is constituted by linguistic detail, and in how to move from the linguistic 'surface' of a text towards interpretation and meaning, will find some useful examples treated in his chapter on "narration.") Fludernik takes the opposite approach, and here she and Abbott part ways dramatically: her approach is firmly grounded in language, her model of narrative analysis is based on linguistic knowledge and precision, and she displays a linguistically informed sensibility towards textual detail. Throughout her volume, the linguistic bedrock of the analysis is evident; and while she acknowledges narrative in other media, language takes center stage in her volume, especially in chapters five and seven.</page><page sequence="23">556 Sabine Gross Evidently, the volumes also differ in the scope of texts they reference and the extent to which they present such texts, not least as a function of the dif- fering degrees to which they include artifacts or media in their coverage-lit- erature, fictional texts, oral communication, film, music. Here, Fludemrnik and Abbott are parallel in drawing on texts mainly from a broad Western tradition. In selecting primary texts both turn to canonical authors, and favorite textual playing fields can be discerned-both resort to Madame Bovary and Tolstoy (Abbott to Anna Karenina, Fludernik to War and Peace); Calvino's If on a Winter's Night a Traveler is featured in both; and where Abbott discusses Mar- tin Amis's Time's Arrow as a work that reverses the arrow of time in narrative, Fludernik cites Ilse Aichinger's "Spiegelgeschichte," an earlier instance of the same technique. The Wenzel contributors, perhaps surprisingly, refer almost exclusively to texts by English-language authors (dozens of them, from the ca- nonical to the contemporary), in usually brief excerpts; in contrast Herman and Vervaeck, as noted, offer two sample texts on which they test and apply their insights. The Companion, finally, offers a particular diversity of textual mate- rial, since the majority of contributions include sometimes detailed analyses of texts, many of them verbal: authors include Ann Beattie, Raymond Chan- dler, Charles Dickens, Ernest Hemingway, Henry James, James Joyce, Franz Kafka, Ian McEwan, Edgar Allen Poe, Philip Roth, Arundhati Roy, William Thackeray, Lev Tolstoy, and Virginia Woolf. There are large areas of agreement in emphases and the kinds of knowl- edge presented. One would be hard pressed to find any topic touched upon in any of the volumes that is not addressed in one or several entries of the Encyclopedia-such as (to return to a few elements mentioned in this article) "space" (which, in addition to the main article, has almost 20 entries in the in- dex), "postcolonialism and narrative," "postclassical narratology," and "post- structuralist approaches to narrative" (the latter two articles authored by Her- man and Vervaeck, who-in contrast to e.g. Niinning [cf. Encyclopedia 450], offer a clear distinction between the two). Individual volumes reveal more specific coinciding and/or complementary interests: both Haupt (in Wenzel) and Stanford Friedman (in the Companion) devote attention to "space"-an attention that takes very different directions in both; Chatman (in the Compan- ion) and Abbott both address forms of adaptation; Peter Brooks's chapter on "Literature and the Law" can be profitably read alongside Abbott's chapter on legal discourse; both Fludernik's and Abbott's undogmatic (and in Fludernik's case, historically bolstered) stance vis-t-vis the thorny "author versus narra- tor" issue will resonate as readers encounter Lanser's nicely differentiated and flexible approach to the question of identity/overlap/non-identity of author and narrator in the Companion; Abbott's discussion of suspense finds a more elaborated echo in Wenzel's chapter on "Spannung," and both are supple- mented by a characteristically succinct Encyclopedia entry on "Suspense and Surprise"; and Hillis Miller's insistence that "[n]arratological distinctions are useful primarily as aids to better reading" (Companion 125) matches Herman</page><page sequence="24">Surveying Narratology 557 and Vervaeck's conviction of the centrality of the literary text and the champi- oning of interpretation in which they and Abbott agree. Each volume offers a useful, reliable, illuminating survey of narratology, with varying degrees of comprehensiveness. Anyone whose ideas about nar- rative are still shaped by such concepts as "omniscience" or "point of view" will find enlightenment in the volumes at hand; more advanced narratologists will be able to engage with them at a correspondingly advanced level of ter- minological and conceptual scholarship as well as appreciate the approach and emphases chosen by the authors or editors. All of them can be recommended highly, and the minor qualifications noted reflect for the most part not so much actual shortcomings as they touch upon questions of level and targeted read- ership. Most are edited with a degree of care that has become the exception rather than the rule; and in most cases considerable attention has been devoted to maximizing the usefulness of the information through features such as in- dexes and glossaries. Future editions-which all of these deserve and will very likely see-should provide an opportunity to correct occasional errors or editing oversights that are generally too minor to merit listing here. In Abbott's case, this would allow noting updated editions of, for instance, Mieke Bal's and Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan's 'classical' volumes on narratology, listed only in their initial first incarnations.14 For Fludernik, future editions would benefit from attention to the stylistic unevenness noted above and a thorough assess- ment of where the text departs from a level suitable for uninitiated readers (especially stretches of chapters 5 and 7), as well as judicious additions to the glossary and the inclusion of an index. The works under review, as will have become evident, are geared to- wards different audiences. Most, if not all of them, have broad appeal and offer material that will satisfy, and quite possibly increase, interest in the vari- ous 'hows' of storytelling. Used thoughtfully and intelligently, narratology can foster insight into one of the core elements of literary experience, de- velop readers' sensibility, and feed widely diverging forms of curiosity and interest-interest in definitory precision, in the dynamics of language, in the appearance of narrative forms across a spectrum of media. Fludernik points to the multidisciplinary appeal of narrative studies while emphasizing "that nar- ratology is increasingly appealed to as a master discipline" (Companion 47). The Encyclopedia editors note an "explosion of interest in narrative" (ix) and a corresponding valuation of the subject in question: "stories have come to be viewed as a basic human strategy for coming to terms with time, process, and change-a strategy that contrasts with, but is in no way inferior to, 'scientific' modes of explanation" (ix). How, then, do we utilize narratology as a mode of explanation that is in turn directed at these "modes of explanation"? While it is easy to accept the enduring significance of human storytelling, the role of narratological in- quiries in the broader disciplinary context of the humanities and beyond re- mains open. For scholars of literature, in particular, narratological explorations</page><page sequence="25">558 Sabine Gross can flatten complexity into reductive categories or move in a self-referential loop of terminological distinctions. An awareness of the near-unavoidability of anthropomorphic assumptions points us back at readers and how they- we-respond to texts and align them with our real-world expectations and assumptions, parsing textual and stylistic features in terms of human com- munication and interaction, tying language to human experience. Linguistic constructedness and the human ability of world-making dovetail to unlock the power of narratives as we read and interpret texts. We may think of "reading for the plot," as Peter Brooks put it (or reading for characters, for emotions, for actions) dismissively as a sort of "realist fallacy"-or we can marvel at the human ability to assemble verbal signs, linguistic cues, and textual construc- tions into a fictional world. Narratology can cast aspersions on this process, comment on it, supplement it, or offer insights that go beyond it. The texts under review, taken together, do return us to open questions. What form of scholarship, of scientific, anthropological, or humanistic inquiry does narratology aspire to be, or do we wish to shape it into? How do we ask it to respond to the way reality and human existence are uniquely shaped in liter- ary texts, and how does it help us to understand, appreciate, and make sense of stories in their specificity, indeed singularity? Its future development depends on such fundamental questions: questions that the reference works and orient- ing volumes discussed here both pose and to which they offer at least partial or implicit responses-but to which readers and practitioners of narratology will also find their individual answers.

William Nelles, in the Routledge Encyclopedia entry on "Embedding," extends Gen- ette's model to an even higher level of embeddings ("pentadiegetic") while insisting that "the precision of Genette's scheme ameliorates the forbidding nature of the terminology-critics adopting the model can discuss even the most complexly embedded texts with a common vo- cabulary" (134). 3 Patrick O'Neill, Fictions of Discourse: Reading Narrative Theory (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1996). 4 Andrew Gibson, Towards a postmodern theory of narrative (Edinburgh: Edinburgh Uni- versity Press, 1996): 145, see also chapters 2 and 6. The kind of radical stance taken by Gibson is not widely reflected in the volumes under discussion, which tend to adopt a more moderate and balanced position. 5 De Gruyter has just announced two more volumes of this genre-an introduction and a lexicon-that will appear after this review article has gone to press: Dietmar Till, Narratologie.

Wolf Schmid, Elemente der Narratologie, chapters 2 and 4. 10 It is not surprising that the best comparative assessments of Stanzel and Genette are advanced by authors from Germany, where Stanzel has been much more influential compared with his lagging and somewhat hesitant international reception. " The "toolkit" metaphor is shared by Jan Christoph Meister ("Narratology as Discipline: The Case for Conceptual Fundamentalism," What is Narratology? Questions and Answers Re- garding the Status ofa Theory, edited by Tom Kindt and Hans-Harald Muller [Berlin, New York: de Gruyter, 2003]: 55-71), who provocatively asserts that "we should learn to appreciate (instead of defending or excusing half-heartedly) the formal and context-free nature of structuralist nar- ratology's fundamental concepts. It is exactly the level of formalisation and abstraction which has made the 'narratological toolkit' so accessible to related disciplines" (69) and insists on the purity of "the procedural rules that define any discipline-and not just narratology-on the systematic and functional level" (69). 12 Cf. for instance Jan Christoph Meister, "Narratology as Discipline" (see note above) and Michael Titzmann, "The Systematic Place of Narratology in Literary Theory and Textual Theory," both in What is Narratology? Questions andAnswers Regarding the Status of a Theory, ed. Tom Kindt and Hans-Harald Miuller (Berlin, New York: de Gruyter, 2003), 55-71, 175-204. Cf. also Erzdhltheorie transgenerisch, intermedial, interdiszipliniir, hrsg. Vera Niinning und Ansgar Niinning (Trier: Wissenschaftlicher Verlag, 2002) with its programmatic title. The latter volume also features two contributions that extend narratological inquiry to drama and poetry, respectively (Eva Miuller-Zettelmann, "Lyrik und Narratologie," 129-153 and Ansgar Niinning and Roy Sommer, "Drama und Narratologie: Die Entwicklung erzahltheoretischer Modelle und Kategorien fuir die Dramenanalyse," ibid. 105-128), as do two monographs that have just ap- peared: Eike Muny, Erzdihlperspektive im Drama. Ein Beitrag zur transgenerischen Narratologie (Muinchen: iudicium, 2008); Jorg Sch6nert, Peter Hiihn, Malte Stein, Lyrik und Narratologie (Berlin, New York: de Gruyter, 2007). See also the entries on "drama in narrative" and "narrative in poetry" in the Encyclopedia. 3 Jan Christoph Meister (see above) comments on the branching out of narratology as a discipline and the concomitant problem he sees of whether to proceed empirically by redefining the "object domain" or methodologically by developing new "concepts and procedures." His sug- gestion: "Instead of labeling [the new narratologies] with compound terms that use 'narratology' as a generic term one should perhaps decide to use it as an attribute that refers to the new prac- tice's dominant (if indeed it is dominant!) methodological heritage. Thus it might make better sense to talk of, say, 'Narratological Cognitivism' than of a 'Cognitivist Narratology'" (69-70). Bearing this comment in mind, one will follow the numerous variations (easy to note thanks to the overview in the Reader's guide, xxi-xxii) in the Encyclopedia among "xy and narrative," "xy in narrative," "xy approaches to narrative," "narrative in xy," "xy in narrative studies," and "xy narratology" with additional interest. 14 Abbott's Introduction, listed as temporarily unavailable in the fall of 2008, may well be undergoing revision for an updated edition. Cambridge University Press did not respond to an inquiry.</page></plain_text>
