KOLB Newcomb College, Tulane University A MERICAN sociology, like other American social sciences, has its roots deep in the nineteenth century moral concern for the welfare of man. Many of its early methods of data gathering were simply an effort to be "scientific" in securing practical knowledge for solving "social problems." Many of its first practitioners were men of the gospel. Even those who were rational- istic critics of religion had no doubts that moral values were real and possessed their own validity. The builders of theoretical systems, Giddings, Ward, and even Sumner, included concepts of good and evil in their "scientific" theories. All sociologists looked on sociology as a means of discriminating among values. The first serious blow to the moral certainty of the new science came with the diffusion of German * The meanings of the word "moral" used here to qualify the word "dilemma" are, of course, exceedingly complex. However, several of the simpler meanings are fully adequate in this context: When the sociologist holds a positivist view of values and a functional theory of religion the dilemma presented is moral because (1) it is difficult if not impossible to determine the right and proper behavior under the circumstances described; (2) principles of right and wrong (ethical principles) are involved; (3) the problem of conformity to a standard of moral right and wrong is presented; (4) and, finally, the dilemma is a dilemma of con- science. The dilemma can be stated briefly as follows: A sociologist who believes that people must believe in the validity of values (functional theory of religion) but that such values actually have no validity (moral and ethical positivism) must either deceive his public or help in dissolving the forces which hold society to- gether. The choices involve a dilemma because neither is morally satisfactory. The demonstration that such a dilemma is involved constitutes the body of the paper. sociological theory into American universities. In particular Max Weber's claim that science must be value-free forced a new humility in moral matters upon those who grasped his argument. For Weber, science is only one possible mode of cognition and it is extremely limited in the type of problems that it can solve. For any scientist to believe that his science provides a basis for choos- ing among ultimate value spheres is the sheerest arrogance. Yet there is nothing in Weber to indi- cate that moral choices are not real choices or that it is impossible to believe that in some sense there exists in the structure of the universe a genuine and real realm of values. Men can and must make moral choices in the realm of value, but they can- not claim scientific warrant for their choices. In Weber's thinking, ultimate values are still ulti- mate, and choice among them is still a matter for great seriousness and the utmost exercise of responsibility. Weber has been attacked many times in recent years for being a root source of value relativism, yet there is nothing in his theory to substantiate the charge.' At the same time that the results of Weber's impact became manifest, trouble for ethically oriented sociologists came from two other quarters: anthropology and philosophical positivism. An- thropologists introduced the concept of culture to the sociologists and in so doing convinced the sociologists that different people had different 1 One of the clearest analyses of the implications of Weber's value theory is Howard Becker's "Supreme Values and the Sociologist, or, Our Roles and Their Loyalties," in his Through Values to Social Interpreta- tion (Durham: Duke University Press, 1950), pp. 281- 305. Here there is no indication that value-judgments are simple personal preferences or only group-induced beliefs ungrounded in reality. 305</page><page sequence="2">306 SOCIAL FORCES value systems and that apparently man could live happily under many different systems of social organization. Further they put the dread term ethnocentrism into the sociologists' vocabulary in such a way that most of the professors of sociol- ogy avoided evaluative discussions of culture so far as it was humanly possible.2 Although the use of the concepts of cultural variability and ethno- centrism does not logically compel one to renounce his belief in the existence of a realm of real values, there can be little doubt but that such renuncia- tion was the psychological effect of their use. Philosophical positivism has probably had a much greater effect than cultural relativism in bringing most theoretically sophisticated sociolo- gists to accept the view that value-judgments have no basis of validity in reality and are simply expressions of personal and group preference. Positivism transforms Weber's attitude of humility before values into one of arrogance. The syllogism is simple. Science is the only valid mode of cogni- tion. The validity of values and other super- empirical ideas cannot be demonstrated by sci- ence. Therefore values have no ontic status.3 The 2 Though it is true that cultures vary and that men can live under different systems of value-ideas, this fact is not a real challenge to the belief in the ontic status of values. There is no reason to believe that the good cannot take different forms, that systems of value- ideas are not imperfect conceptions of the ontic values, or that a variety of good eliminates the possibility of real evil. The whole question of cultural variability and ethnocentrism needs to be reexamined. As many writers have pointed out there seem to be certain universal moral patterns as well as relative patterns. Development of moral patterns toward greater univer- sality is also possible. Proximate values must be dis- tinguished from ultimate values. Thus it may be wrong for a society to say that monogamy is an ultimate value, but correct for them to say that love is an ultimate value. In such a case to be ethnocentric about monog- amy is stupid, but to be ethnocentric about the value of love is one of the conditions for the belief in its ultimate nature. This task of distinguishing genuine ultimates from pseudo-ultimates is not one that can be performed by science, if it is possible at all; but science cannot disprove the possibility of performing the task, and the existence of cultural variability and ethno- centrism cannot be used as a means of denying this possibility. 3There is an extreme variant of positivism which holds that not even science is a valid mode of cognition, since what the scientist studies is his own responses to an unknown something. Thus science is valid only within the framework of its own axioms and objectivity conclusion takes two forms, one moderate, the other radical. The first conclusion states that one must of necessity be agnostic concerning the ontic status of values. Since science is the only mode of knowing reality, any reality which cannot be known scientifically is unknowable and therefore we can say nothing about it. The second conclu- sion presses its logical attack harder and simply categorizes all statements about value and other super-empirical ideas as nonsense.4 There has been some effort on the part of sociol- ogists to cling to Weber's position of agnosticism and humility concerning values in scientific en- deavor, and hence to make no statements con- cerning the possible ontic status of values. Yet even in the most careful works, we find sociologists making the positivistic metaphysical leap into complete agnosticism or complete value-sub- jectivism. Thus in two recent highly intelligent discussions of value one finds the conception that expressions of value are merely "acts of will and sentiment," and that ultimate ends have a "sub- jective and a transcendent quality-an existence becomes a matter of agreement among trained ob- servers. If one does not wish to accept these axioms he can quite legitimately turn to a religious or meta- physical frame of reference. Only, he is warned, he must expect to pay the price in the form of maladaptation. The outstanding exponent of this form of positivism in sociology is George A. Lundberg. See especially the first chapter of his Foundations of Sociology (New York: Macmillan, 1939). 4 To avoid possible confusion it is necessary to state what a belief in the ontic status of values implies and what it does not imply. To believe in the ontic status of values implies that somehow in the structure of the universe values objectively exist independent of their apprehension and espousal by man. Thus if it is ob- jectively wrong to commit murder it is wrong even though no man knows it and no man espouses it. Such a belief does not imply that an idea which a man or a group of men have about values is correct. Thus if a society maintains that it is ultimately evil to have more than one wife, this value-idea may be wrong or right. If there is an ontic realm of values such an idea cannot be nonsense in the positivistic meaning of the term, since it is an idea, correct or incorrect, about something. The metaphysical problem is, of course, how men can bring their ideas of good and evil into a close and closer approximation of the objective reality of good and evil. The modes of cognition usually recommended are the use of reason, conscience, intuition, revelation, and, for proximate and instrumental values, careful use of the scientific knowledge of the consequences of certain value commitments.</page><page sequence="3">VALUES, POSITIVISM, AND FUNCTIONAL TEEORY OF RELIGION 307 only in the indoctrinated mind."5 These two ideas go far beyond what we scientifically know about values. Philosophers who believe that values have ontic status hold that value expressions are acts of reason and intuition as well as of will and senti- ment, and they also hold that values have existence independent of the indoctrinated mind. Such thinkers cannot be proved wrong by science, but only by the presuppositions of the postivistic metaphysics. For the purposes at hand, however, we are more interested in the influence that the positivistic orientation toward values has had on sociologists as active members of the Western European community than as pure scientists. It has been stated above that it is possible to hold to Weberian neutrality as a scientist and at the same time to believe passionately in the reality of the value sphere. From the work of sociologists in applied fields, from their discussions of such work, and from conversations with many of them, I am con- vinced that few sociologists who have been sub- jected to the doctrines of cultural relativity and positivism have such an intellectual orientation toward values in their non-scientific lives. Most well trained sociologists have transformed Weber's neutrality in science into the positivist position that values are expressions of personal and social preference and have no ontic status that can be apprehended by reason and intuition. It is an empirical fact, however, that some men can continue to act morally under such conditions -at least for a time. It is probable that most sociologists, while they do not believe that the values of freedom and human dignity have ontic status, still prefer these values to totalitarian values. They are still democrats and men of good will, even though they must always preface their statements with the dictum that these attitudes simply express their own preferences and the preferences of the society in which they have grown up. There may be some few sociologists who have used value subjectivism as a rationalization for becoming experts in human manipulation without commitment to policy; there may be others who have rationalized their failure to inquire into the ethical limitations of narrow values which they have espoused by such value relativism. But it is probably safe to say that most members of the profession still adhere to the values of human freedom and dignity. I shall attempt to show in this paper that the recent development of the functional theory of religion, if sound, forces these men into a position where they can no longer adhere to a purely sub- jective theory of value validity and still believe in the possibility of human freedom and a democratic social structure. They may, perhaps, continue to be men of good will but they cannot continue to believe that it is possible for all men to have equal access to knowledge and truth. The reason is simple. Sociologists have believed for some time that in order for a society to exist the members of that society must share a system of values. If the ultimate significance of the functional theory of religion is to indicate that at least most men in a society must not only share values but must also believe that these value-ideas are connected with a realm of values which has ontic status, the posi- tivistic sociologist who prefers a free society is placed in an intolerable dilemma. It is a prime postulate of the theory of freedom that knowledge of the truth will make men free and that in a demo- cratic society all men must have access to the truth. Yet if the idea that values have ontic status is false but necessary for the existence of society, the sociologist cannot spread such truth. To give all men access to this truth would be to destroy society, for men cannot know to be false what they must believe to be true. To refrain from spreading the truth is to deny men their freedom and dignity, for the sociologist would then be placing a lie at the center of their social existence and would be making himself a member of an elite who know the truth -but must conceal it from the mass.6 5William J. Goode, Religion Among the Primitives (Glencoe: The Free Press, 1951), p. 23; Kingsley Davis, Ilhman Society (New York: Macmillan, 1949), p. 526. 6 If the functional theory of religion is valid, I am making an assumption here that is probably false, namely that the sociologists themselves are not subject to the sociological and psychological necessity to believe in the ontic status of values. I am assuming in other words that the positivists can retain their good will and their psychological balance even though they reject what is to other people a necessity. I am making the assumption because my imagination does not have the capacity to envision what would happen in the per- sonalities of those who try to cling to the postivistic view of values and yet at the same time are under in- tense psychological and sociological pressure to believe in the ontic status of values. I am inclined to believe that in many cases a sudden outcome would be a com- pletely irrational embracing of some rigid set of value- ideas with the complete assumption that these value-</page><page sequence="4">308 SOCIAL FORCES The existence of this dilemma depends upon the validity of the functional theory of religion with its ultimate implication that the members of a society must believe in the objective existence of values independent of the apprehension and the wishes of men. Prior to the full development of this theory in the last few years, it was possible for the moral positivist to believe that consensus could be developed without this condition. Many sociol- ogists "knew" that they believed the values of our society to be desirable even though there was no real goodness in such values; they therefore believed that through education others could ac- cept values on the same basis. Those who inquired further perhaps accepted the pragmatist's doctrine that most value conflicts can be decided by exam- ining the relationship of the values in conflict to those concerning which there is agreement and that if reasonable men get together they can reach the conclusion that everyone ultimately has the same preferences. It is almost certain that they did not ask whether their present acceptance of values was not dependent either upon their own earlier acceptance of the idea that values have ontic status or upon their parents' acceptance of the same idea. They did not inquire into the sig- nificance of the empirical fact that what most people seem to want to know is not what their final preferences are but what they finally ought to prefer. It is precisely to these neglected facets of man's value oriented behavior that the func- tional theory of religion points and through which it indicates the necessity for a belief in the ontic status of values as a condition of social cohesion and personal stability. The functional analysis of religion at the societal level begins with the question of the significance of the universality of religion. If religion makes no contribution to society, how is it that it has not long since disappeared?7 In order to get at the functions which religion performs it is necessary to understand its structural principles and its interrelations with other areas of social life.8 In every society there is a distinction drawn be- tween the sacred and the profane. The sacred is set apart by attitudes of respect and awe, and is partly composed of material objects toward which these attitudes are directed. One cannot find the source of sacredness in the sacred objects as such, but can find it in perceiving that sacred objects are symbols. They are almost always found to be symbols of values, social forms, or supernatural beings. Thus religious symbols and the rites and beliefs surrounding them are directed toward a superempirical world. The answer to what sacred objects symbolize and toward what religious beliefs and practices are oriented poses two new questions. First, why should men be concerned about a superempirical world? Second, why should their attitudes be those of respect and awe? The answer is to be found in the fact that members of a society must share a system of ultimate ends if the society is to endure. These ends may be divided into two categories: those which are achievable on this earth and those which are not. Those ends which cannot be achieved in this world must have their locus in a superempirical world. Further the superempirical world can appear as the source of the existence and moral validity of those ultimate ends which can be attained in this world. Thus if goodness of ideas are a perfect reflection of the ontic realm of values, but this is largely speculative. 7Kingsley Davis's "Introduction" to William J. Goode, op. cit., p. 15. As Davis points out, this question does not assume that religion is entirely adaptive, that all its functions will be the same in all societies, or that if it does perform some necessary universal function, such function cannot at some future time be performed by different institutions. 8 The following functional account of religion is drawn almost wholly from the extremely clear analysis by Kingsley Davis in his JThman Society, pp. 520-545. He, in turn, has drawn from Durkheim, William Robertson Smith, Radcliffe-Brown, Malinowski, Weber and Parsons, and not only has made a synthesis notable for its clarity but has added new hypotheses of his own. Goode, in the work cited above, has utilized this frame of reference for a careful analysis of religion in a small number of primitive societies. He also has added some new hypotheses, some careful quali- fications of functional theory, and considerable sub- stantiating evidence. I have used the statements of Davis and Goode be- cause these statements, taken separately or combined, constitute the most up-to-date and complete accounts of the functional theory of religion available in the literature. They have been quoted at length because the full import of the functional theory of religion must be grasped, if the point of this paper is to be established. The theoretical positions of these two men has been well worked out, and constitutes an improvement on the earlier statements of Parsons and of those who de- veloped the theory in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is true, of course, that even today not all sociologists accept this theoretical account of religion and hence are not faced with the dilemma. But Davis is and Goode is, and so are almost all of the functional theorists among whom I include myself.</page><page sequence="5">VALUES, POSITIVISM, AND FUNCTIONAL THfEORY OF RELIGION 309 action is something that can be achieved in the world, the definition of what is good and the validity of this definition must be derived from the other world. Further, if there are supernatural entities they function to support man's belief in the validity of ultimate ends. This super-world must appear real to the actors, even though its existence cannot be demonstrated scientifically.9 Thus religion may promote social unity and conformity in four ways. It offers an explanation of the origin and validity of group ends. It provides ritual reaffirmation of these ends. Through sacred objects it offers a concrete reference for the values. And finally it is a source of rewards and punish- ments. Although, according to Davis, this super- empirical realm is "illusory" it becomes very real to the members of the society. In other words not only do realizable ultimate group ends assume ontic status, but so also do other-worldly ends, supernatural beings, and divine rewards and punishments. It is clear, however, that to Davis this ontic status is spurious, since it cannot be verified by scientific inquiry. Now the functional theory of religion has been built up on the basis of data gathered primarily from primitive religions. There still remains the question as to the future of religion in civilized society. Both Goode and Davis show admirable scientific caution in the ideas that they advance, but there does seem to be agreement on a few cen- tral issues. Central to their theory is the idea that rational thought can supplant religion only to a certain point. There will always be the need for ultimate values and the validity of these values must always rest on a superempirical foundation. The gods may become less anthropomorphic, many of the factual statements of religion may be disproved, superempirical entities may become vaguer and more remote, religious practices may become segmental to the society, religious ho- mogeneity may tend to diminish, and finally religious systems may become fragmented and some of their functions taken over by other agen- cies. But secularization can only go so far. Even though the gods disappear and other anthro- pomorphic entities vanish, there must still be the belief that ultimate values have an objective source and some degree of objective validity. Whatever happens, men must believe that their ends are good ends, that there is meaning in the universe, and that in some way good must triumph in the end. Men to exist must believe in the ontic status of the superempirical.10 This is not the place to concern ourselves about the scientific validity of the functional theory of religion. It can be said, I believe, that it rings truer than older rationalistic theories, that it is supported by considerable evidence, and that Davis and Goode have successfully answered many of the objections that have been made to it. But if we assume its fundamental validity, it does create the moral dilemma I have indicated. To spread the idea that a belief in ultimate validity of values is necessary but illusory would be to destroy society through destroying or confusing this belief. Yet to urge people to accept the idea that there is an ontic realm of values while believing oneself that such an idea is false is deliberately to deprive people of the knowledge necessary for their freedom and dignity. What then is the positivistic sociologist to do in his role as a member of a democratic community? As is usual in the case of dilemmas, close examina- tion indicates more than two paths of possible action. If the sociologist cannot find it possible to change his metaphysical hypothesis concerning the subjective quality of assigning moral validity to values, there are at least three courses open to him. First, he can value his integrity to such a degree that while he will not spread abroad his doctrine of moral subjectivism, neither will he urge people to believe in what he thinks is basically an illusion. Deeply pessimistic concerning the future of the human race, he will stand aside in a darkly splendid aloofness, bearing in his own mind what he knows is the doom of the human species. According to Irving Kristol this is the position that Freud took when in the later years of his life 9Davis's positivistic bias toward values and the superempirical is shown by his statement that "The unseen world is of course fictitious, but it must appear real to the actor. . . ." Ibid., p. 527. My italics. 10 Ibid., pp. 541-544; Goode, op. cit., pp. 219-226. One point should be made here for later reference. Neither Davis nor Goode, nor any of the other func- tionalists for that matter, have explored the possibility of a society believing in the existence of a real super- empirical world and yet also believing that their own value-ideas are only greater or lesser approximations of the values of this world. Yet it is characteristic of certain types of civilized societies that this approach is taken to values. In our own societies there are some religious denominations which hold that their image of the superempirical truth is only proximate, and certainly many realist philosophers of modern times have taken the position that though an objective realm of value exists we can know it only imperfectly.</page><page sequence="6">310 SOCIAL FORCES he came to believe that man would never discard religion even though it was a mass obsessional neurosis." There is a dignity and honesty in this position that must be respected, even though one disagrees with it. Except in times of extreme crisis most men, even intellectual men, seldom have the courage to accept the loneliness and isolation that the position just described entails. More likely is an extreme retreat in another direction, a retreat into the shelter of the expert. Sociological knowledge will be sold to the highest bidder and the sociologi- cal expert, isolated from policy making positions, will plead lack of responsibility. He will not tell the people to believe in an illusory superempirical world, but his knowledge of the necessity of this belief and of the means of securing and manipu- lating it will be at the service of those who are not so wary of accepting responsibility. It is doubtful that in the long run the mass of people can be successfully manipulated by the expert and his leader, but there may be a bitter short run price to pay for accepting the premise that men must have a myth but that the myth is an illusion. Finally, if the positivist clings to his humanism and refuses to isolate himself or to become an irresponsible expert, he may take upon himself the task of using his knowledge to make men a little happier and a little more adjusted. He can, of course, no longer hope to make men free, but by lowering his aspirations perhaps he can make life in the cage more endurable by giving them a myth in which they can believe, a sense of partici- pation, even though the channels of power be far removed, and a feeling of freedom by asking of them no more than he has taught them to do. Here again it is doubtful that in the long run men can be so manipulated, but in the short run the price for adjustment would be freedom. Further, it is somewhat unlikely that such power would continue to be used for the prime purpose of ad- justment and happiness. The kindly expert in power can become as brutalized as any man, and 1984 can come under the guidance of either politi- cian or scientist. Whether it can endure is another question. But perhaps the positivist can forsake his posi- tivism. There is nothing in science that compels one to assert the subjective character of values. It is possible to return to the position of Weber, to recognize that the sphere of science is limited, but that beyond that sphere there are other modes of knowledge and responsibility. Such a return can- not and should not be dictated by a recognition of the consequences of not returning. If a belief in the ontic status of values has the consequence of permitting human beings to be free, the -conse- quence is a result of the truth of the belief, not the truth of the belief a result or an image of the consequence. A knowledge of the consequences of returning and not returning to a belief in the ob- jectivity of values can, however, be used as one source of evidence supporting the belief. Although it may be false, it is a reasonable assumption that what man must universally believe to be true is true. At least it makes little sense for man to take the opposite position, although non-man might be perfectly justified in doing so. In any event the sociologist can use his own reason, intuition, ethi- cal inclinations, and conscience in renouncing a position that makes human existence meaningless. To renounce positivism, however, is not fully to solve the problem. Ethical skepticism, rational- ism, pragmatism, and finally positivism were in large measure the intellectual result of a revolt against authoritarianism in religion and ethics. To agree that their final implication is to deny human freedom, is not to deny that in their incep- tion they were designed to make men free. An acceptance of the belief that values have ontic status and that our own system of value-ideas represents an exact perception of the objective value structure of the universe is to return to authoritarian realism and to lose all that the in- tellectual revolt has gained. Human freedom lies in part in the very discrepancy between values as they exist and values as they are perceived and con- ceived by men. The path must be left open so that men are free to modify their conception of value; in this lies the possibility of progress and at the same time of disaster. Within this frame of refer- ence the better life lies in the future if men have the patience and tolerance to act tentatively on 11 Irving Kristol, "God and the Psychoanalysts," Commentary, VIII (1949), 434-443. Kristol's article parallels this one in many respects in showing that the psychoanalyst, if he follows Freud's theory of religion, is placed in the dilemma of knowing that religion is necessary to personality but an illusion none the less. It is interesting that this cycle of thought in psycho- analysis occurred within the life work of Freud him- self. Kristol errs, I believe, in placing religious truth solely in the past and identifying the value-ideas of the religious past with the ontic realm of values.</page><page sequence="7">PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL GROUPS 311 the basis of our value-knowledge now and to con- tinue searching for greater truth in the value sphere just as they have learned to do in science. Nega- tively we can define some aspects of evil on the basis of our experience in the last fifty years and by a study of history; but we can say very little about the realm of the good. Some things we know about love, beauty, honesty, etc., but the greatest potentialities for good, both for its defini- tion and for its actualization, lie in the future.
