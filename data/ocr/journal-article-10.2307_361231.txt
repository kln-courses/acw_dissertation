<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAUNCEY WRIGHT: RADICAL EMPIRICIST JOSEPH L. BLAU C HAUNCEY Wright is one of the most interesting figures in the history of American thought. His published papers in philosophy' are chiefly concerned with the analysis of vari- ous aspects of evolutionary theory and his competence in this area was praised by Darwin himself. Yet with the single excep- tion of the phrase "cosmical weather," which he used in a paper attacking the nebular hypothesis, and which he meant to repre- sent a Lucretian fortuitousness in the universe,2 his writings are something less than memorable. He constructed no system; adhered consistently to no school. Gail Kennedy has used the term "pragmatic naturalism" to define his general approach to the problems about which he wrote.8 His most significant essay, "The Evolution of Self-Consciousness," treats of man as a natural organism, differing from other natural organisms and from inorganic matter in degree rather than kind; Ken- nedy points out how Wright here anticipated William James's concept of "pure experience." 4 Despite Wright's lack of literary ambition and of the will to influence people by the written word, he was highly praised by his friends and acquaintances, even when they disagreed with his views. John Fiske, the Spencerian, praised Wright, who consistently attacked Spencer, as a "wise and amiable man," and declared that "an intellect more powerful from its happy union of acuteness with sobriety has probably not yet been seen in America."'5 Charles Saunders Peirce acknowledged an in- debtedness to Wright for some of the guiding conceptions 1 Chauncey Wright, Philosophical Discussions, edited by Charles Eliot Norton (New York, 1877). 2 Philip Wiener does not accept this interpretation of the phrase.

This is not sur- prising because we are given to understand that his chief influ- ence was a personal one, exerted through his conversation. "His best work has been done in conversation; and in the acts and writings of the many friends he influenced his spirit will, in one way or another, as the years roll on, be more operative than it ever was in direct production."8 Fiske, repeating the suggestion that Wright's chief influence was personal suggests the great loss the world has thus suffered: "None save the friends who knew the rich treasures of his mind as shown in familiar conversation are likely to realize how great is the loss which philosophy has sustained in his death."9 Although we have no record of Wright's conversation, we do have some indication of the direction in which his later in- terests were turning. Charles Eliot Norton, in a biographical preface to Wright's published Philosophical Discussions, as- serted that "the questions of morality, of politics, of jurisprud- ence, of education, in the light thrown on them by psychology and by experience, were those which in his later years were continually assuming an increasing share of his attention."10 Fortunately, then, we are not in hopeless case, for the devotion of Wright's friends has left us a tangible memorial of some of his familiar moments, in the published volume of his letters." In these letters may be found many suggestions of Wright's 6 See C. Hartshorne and P.

An examination of these materials leads to the realization that the dominant temper of Wright's philosophic thinking, as it was of his scientific, was opposition to the elevation of any principle into an overarching metaphysical touchstone. Thus Wright refused to transform the biological hypothesis of evo- lution into the cosmological principle of evolutionism. In moral and religious matters, too, he opposed the transcendent- al tendency to convert the propositions of any one science into the basic principles of all sciences. "It may be, or doubtless is, true that Paris has brought destruction on itself because it was not Christian; but this is as little pertinent to a practical view of the matter as is the fact that its palaces were burned because they were not fireproof."12 His anti-transcendental view appears most clearly in his dis- cussions of questions concerning the supreme ends of life, those to which the word "religious" is usually applied. Thus when Miss Grace Norton, one of his most consistent corre- spondents, asked this question in its simplest form: "Why do we exist?" Chauncey replied by the denial that our lives sub- serve any ulterior, spiritual ends. "All the ends of life are, I am persuaded, within the sphere of life, and are in the last analysis, or highest generalization, to be found in the preservation, con- tinuance, and increase of life itself, in all its quantities of rank, intensity, and number." 13 Somewhat later in the same letter Wright suggested a criticism of the naive and sentimental hedonism characteristic of some men of his time "who look on life as a playground which they think their Maker has laid 12 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 227; to Miss Grace Norton, June 6, 1871. 13 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 274; to Miss Grace Norton, July 29, 1874. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who was associated with Wright, James, Peirce, and others in an informal discussion group which Peirce in retrospect formalized into a "Metaphysical Club," expressed the similar thought that "from the point of view of the world, the end of life is life."

Chauncey believed that "in the moral world difficulty increases success," 15 a view which his Puritan forbears who sat in the church of Jonathan Edwards would certainly have shared. He could in no way be led to hedonism. Character, not happiness, is what men must strive through their lives to achieve. Happiness may be the incidental result of this striv- ing; it "is not a thing to be attained; but it may lie all along the way. This is what the old philosophers meant when they said that happiness is not a real or rational end, and that virtue only could be a real attainment." 16 "Character" was earlier defined by Wright as "unreserved devotion to the best we know" and was described as "reli- gious." 7 What he meant by "religious character" is evident from a letter at about the same time: From doing a religious duty there are no visible benefits to the agent, and from neglecting to do it no visible evils, evident to any but himself. If his imagination of a future reward or punishment determines this invisible restraint, his religion is superstitious. But if immediate happiness in doing his duty, or misery in not doing it, is the ultimate sanction, then his religion is real, or a part of his character.18 By "religious," then, Wright did not mean an attitude belong- ing to any specific form of theistic belief. "Practical theism," in its ordinary meaning, he rejected completely, because its 14 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 281. 15 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 273- 16 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 21o; to Miss Jane Norton, November 20o, 1870. 17 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 134; to Francis Ellingwood Abbot, October 28, 1867. 18 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 115; to Norton, August 18, 1867.</page><page sequence="5">CHAUNCEY WRIGHT: RADICAL EMPIRICIST 499 advocates usually stressed "the exclusion from the mind of all evidence not favorable to received religious doctrines." He thought that this "put religious sentiment in a false position - one incompatible, not only with intellectual freedom, but with the soundest development of religious character." 19 Even earlier than this, Wright seems to have been inclined to reject supernaturalism completely, and to argue in the di- rection of such secular faith as Ethical Culture, or the "Free Religion" which his friend Abbot espoused. Chauncey insisted that "the test of a true faith is emotional and moral, not in- tellectual. Our respects must decide what is worthy of belief. Not what claims our respect, but what gains it, is our true faith, and the basis of our religion; and nobility of character is the sole end and criterion of its validity." 20 There are, however, indications in other letters that it was not supernaturalism, but rather the concept of an immanent, anthropomorphic deity as preached in the churches which he rejected. He was, as he said at one time, an agnostic, as were many other of the scientific thinkers of his period. To Abbot he wrote in answer to a request for his "speculative beliefs con- cerning the existence of a God and the immortality of the soul." The verdict of "not proven" is the kind of judgment I have formed on these matters; but not on that account am I warranted in taking up a position against the general opinion of my fellow-citizens, for this would be to become as illogical as the most confident among them. Atheism is speculatively as unfounded as theism.... I have no desire to wake into a strange, unknown future life, and I can discover no valid reasons for any confidence in such a waking.21 He also argued forcefully against anthropomorphic concep- tions of deity in another letter written to Francis Ellingwood Abbot criticising the latter's "A Radical's Theology." 22 19 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 134; to F.

He re- sented particularly the domination of morality by theology, and the accompanying distortion of the values of human exist- ence. At the same time he accepted the historical interpreta- tion that theological beliefs were held largely because of their traditional association with certain moral ideas. He especially attacked the reversal of this association, and the false and mis- leading view of some believers that doubts of the theological traditions carry with them "contempt for all that is noble and worthy in human character." The aspect of this belief which most repelled him was the implication drawn from it that man's life is "utterly worthless unless it is to be prolonged to in- finity; that is, I suppose, the worth of any part - say a year's life - is infinitesimal, even if filled with the purest enjoyments, the noblest sympathies, and the most beneficent activities." Under no conditions could "such a view of the values of the present human life" satisfy his skeptical mind.23 As a substitute for theological foundations in both morality and religion he suggested "the 'lower' ground of common-sense," or the gen- eral beliefs of man.24 Wright was most unsympathetic to such fundamental theo- logical positions as the belief in divine retribution, but he was equally in opposition to such popular views as that war might be avoided by increased attention to religious education. At the conclusion of the Franco-Prussian War he expressed his hope "that the human race, may yet find out the secret of peace- ful progress," but asserted that this could not come about "un- til a field for such a culture is prepared through the permanent conquest of strength by wisdom.... Till then, men cannot be made sufficiently Christian to keep the peace." This concern for the Christianizing of men had, in his opinion, nothing to do with religious education. In fact, "the question is not so 23 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 133-134; to F. E. Abbot, October 28, 1867. 24 Letters of Chauncey Wright, ioo; to F. E.

"5 From what has gone before it is evident that in Wright's mind religion did not necessarily mean theology or even the- ism; on the other hand, it did not mean morality. A careful analysis of one of his letters to Norton will clarify his position. Subjectively, he defined religion as "a man's devotion - the complete assent and concentration of his will - to any object which he acknowledges to have a right to his entire service, and supreme control over his life." Objectively defined, religion "means the object or objects whose claims to this supremacy are acknowledged." There are two possible types of irreligious men: "first, one who acknowledges no supreme ends or objects; or, secondly, one who, though he acknowledges, does not ha- bitually submit his will to such a power." Wright, by his re- fusal to recognize any non-natural ends for life, qualifies as ir- religious by his definition. As for morality, subjectively it is "the habit of observing certain rules of conduct, deemed worthy or conducive to gener- ally desirable ends, whether with or without an acknowledge- ment of the supremacy of these rules as injunctions, or the su- premacy of the ends which they are believed to subserve." In objective terms, morality means "the rules of conduct deemed worthy or subservient to any generally desirable ends, whether these are acknowledged as supreme or not." Following from these two definitions, there are two kinds of immoral men, men who do not observe "habitually and consistently any principles of conduct: either, first, from infirmity of purpose or want of discipline; or, secondly, from pure selfishness or a disregard of generally desirable ends." Religion and morality are similar in that both are concerned with the practical rather than the speculative side of man's na- ture. In fact, "religious and moral duties are often indistin- 25 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 226-227; to Miss Grace Norton, June 6, 1871.</page><page sequence="8">502 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY guishable." The distinction can be made by regarding two characteristics of religious duties, "their absolute or uncon- ditional character" and "their inutility, or the immediacy of the relation of act to object or end." Other duties which do not have this "immediate and un- conditional" character are produced in civilization. These "partial, relative, conditional duties," which are the concern of morality in the narrower sense of the word, "may be enforced by meaner motives than the acknowledgement of uncondi- tional obligations as the grounds of all right conduct. Hence, the possibility of an irreligious morality." 26 In this letter, which Wright intended "to show that religion and morality are definable and distinguishable independently of creeds and codes," we see clearly how Wright conceived the contiguity of religion and morality. "Religious and moral duties are often indistinguishable," but religion and morality are not identical. A further attempt to distinguish the in- distinguishable by formulating a narrower definition of each is the theme of one of Wright's later letters to the same friend. He was dissatisfied "with the state in which we left the distinc- tion between moral and religious duties. The idea that the one consists of the obligations of the highest expediency, while the other is concerned with absolute obligations," now seemed to him unsatisfactory and trivial. After rejecting the Calvinistic "identification of religious and all other obligations with le- gality," he turns to a restatement of the threefold division "which Mill adopts from the Catholic casuists": 1. The truly legal duties, which have corresponding rights in other human beings and real sanctions in the punitive powers of the State, - such as duties of refraining from various forms of vio- lence, for example; or paying one's debts, and keeping other legally sanctioned contracts; 2. The positively moral duties, which are without legal sanctions, and are not enforced except by depriving the delinquent of voluntarily, or freely rendered benefits, and by 26 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 97-99; to Norton [February 18, 1867].</page><page sequence="9">CHAUNCEY WRIGHT: RADICAL EMPIRICIST 503 the consequent evils of such deprivations; 3. Those duties which are above the sanctions of fear or favor, and have their rewards and their sanctions either in another life or in themselves, - or in the evils of the absence of the requisite motive to them.27 Thus the last group, the religious duties, includes all these ob- ligations regardless of their sanction which the individual re- quires of himself beyond the demands of society (legal duties) and those which are made of others beside himself (moral duties). Thus in Wright's classification, "nothing is properly called a duty which has not some sanction; that is, some real motive, in fact, to do it." 28 Whether it be expressed in the Socratic doctrine that it is better to suffer injustice than to do it, or in the Stoic doctrine and modern cliche that virtue is its own reward, "the true re- ligious sanction is the real superiority of disinterested rational actions as a source of happiness to the agent himself.29 This allows for the possibility that an act of piety, an act performed by an individual in complete accordance with the authority or tradition of a religious group, may not necessarily be religious in its essential character. The religious sanction "determines, not, indeed, what really are religious duties, but which of our actions are done in the truly religious spirit." 30 Wright recognized that "the classification of duties accord- ing to their sanctions is not scientific and permanent, but his- toric and subject to change with the moral and intellectual advance of the race." 31 In our time, the religious idea of duty has grown so prominent, through the influence of Christianity, that the novelty of it to the childish mind of the Greeks can hardly be realized. With this change in the moral feelings of the world, the distri- bution of duties into the three classes has also changed, and is 27 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 114-115; to Norton, August 18, 1867. 28 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 116. 29 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 116-117. 30 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 117. 31 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 117.</page><page sequence="10">504 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY progressively changing as the world moves on. Moral duties be- come legal ones, or are peremptorily required by law. Religious duties become moral ones, or are demanded of us by the consciences of other men; and with intellectual progress (which is the funda- mental one), duties of which men are ignorant become known, and the extent of what good we can do (ideally meritorious, without be- ing either morally or legally binding on us) is constantly growing.32 Although this is a dynamic analysis, we need not ascribe it to the influence of Darwin on Wright's thought, because ear- lier writers had developed dynamic categories for historical analysis. Again, Wright pointed out that in discussing the classification of duties, he was not entering into the descrip- tion of duties. This he reserved to the science of Deontology, "of what ought to be done, whatever the sanctions may be by which a principle or rule of conduct is enforced." The princi- ples by which this science decides the nature of specific obliga- tions are not necessarily themselves the sanctions of these obli- gations. "From the scientific point of view, there is but one fundamental sanction, to wit, the test of all right conduct (for the test of conduct is fundamentally the warrant of it), namely, the 'highest good.' "33 The parenthetic observation that "the test of conduct is fundamentally the warrant of it," clearly Wright's statement of the "pragmatic test" applied to moral- ity, is so casually presented, without comment or explanation, that it may very well be assumed that it was commonly under- stood and recognized by his friends as early as 1867, the date of this letter. Shortly before his death, in one of his rare apothegms, Chauncey Wright summarized much of his thinking on the question of morality in terms which require no comment: "The Golden Mean, as a rule of duty, is more level with reason than the Golden Rule, though perhaps as a sentiment it is less effectively beneficial in the unreasoning mass." 34 It was the 32 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 116. s3 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 117. 34 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 352; to Miss Jane Norton, September 1, 1875.</page><page sequence="11">CHAUNCEY WRIGHT: RADICAL EMPIRICIST 505 Greek rather than the Judaeo-Christian moral idea to which he gave his allegiance. The disputed question of free-will, which inspired so many thoughtful American contributions from Jonathan Edwards to Rowland Hazard, was abstracted by Wright from the reli- gious context in which most of the earlier discussion had taken place. Partly to exclude the religious connotations of terms used, and partly to avoid vagueness and ambiguity, he sug- gested the use of the terms "determination" and "indetermina- tion."85 He is careful to note "that a distinction should be made between actual causal determinations and the logical determinations of thought --between what is determined without reference to our knowledge and what is determined in our knowledge." He then states the question of free-will in his own terms and explains the position he takes with respect to it. The question is whether there are any elements known or un- known which enter into volitional determinations not in accord- ance with the law of causation or other than the regular conse- quents of conditions or determinations previously existing in our characters and circumstances.... All testimony in the matter must be negative. Dr. Johnson says "We know our wills are free, and there's an end on't"; but I contend that we do not know that our wills are not free, and there isn't even a beginning of a solution of the question from the testimony of consciousness. With reference to the possibility of any other evidence, the only practical prob- lem is whether, in considering human actions, we ought or ought not to presume that they fall under the law of causation, just as all other phenomena in nature are presumed to do.36 The most that can be said is that there is a sense of freedom, or liberty of choice which is simply the "consciousness of a power to choose in a different way from that we actually follow."37 35 Wright was exceedingly sensitive to semantic values. See especially, his letter to Abbot, August 13, 1867, Letters of Chauncey Wright, 112-113, and the careful analysis of language in his long essay on "The Evolution of Self-Con- sciousness," Philosophical Discussions, 199-266. 36 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 73-74; to Simon Newcomb, May 18, 1865. 37 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 72.</page><page sequence="12">506 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY This illusion of presumed moral freedom is really the substi- tution of "internal control in place of external control; centric or self control, which, so far from making a man free, in the scientific sense of the word, makes his life regular and his con- duct calculable. He has a freedom like that of the solar system or like that of a normal growth." 38 Somewhat later, in a letter to Abbot, Wright returned to this theme; he denied that there was truly an opposition be- tween consciousness and force, an opposition which he saw as the basis of the doctrine of free-will, "which finds, of course, a fundamental contrariety between the freedom of conscious- ness and the necessity of force." The free-will doctrine he de- clared to be "a pure assumption, which ignores all just scientific method, and even contradicts some of the results of science." The "mysterious Power which fills the universe," postulated by Abbot, manifests force, law, fate, if you will, - everywhere, in mental and spiritual, as well as in the merely physical phenomena of nature; and it manifests consciousness, in varying degrees, throughout the whole organic world, reaching its highest manifestations in man. But man, however conscious, is none the less a part of fate, - though not compelled by an external fate to act by laws which are not his, or by determinations which are not in himself. No real fate or necessity is indeed manifested anywhere in the universe, - only a phenomenal regularity.39 Within this pattern of phenomenal regularity, of man's planetary freedom to obey his own nature, there is, neverthe- less, a freedom of the will, which may be called "our freedom from selfishness." This freedom means that we are "led or drawn to happiness to which we are not impelled by antece- dent motives." It is a "capacity for being led beyond what pleasure or pain impels us to do"; it is "the characteristic irra- tionality of human beings, through which we may be led to 38 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 74. 39 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 11o-111; to F. E. Abbot, August 13, 1867.</page><page sequence="13">CHAUNCEY WRIGHT: RADICAL EMPIRICIST 507 ruin or to bliss." 40 There is here a suggestion that social man is something more than he was in his original individuality; this suggestion recurs through Wright's letters, and is most clearly expressed in this passage: We may define the human being as one whose nature, as we know it, descends mainly by other channels than those of the blood, - in the spiritual and invisible currents of an extremely complex, arti- ficial life, without which the human nature is immediately lost in the brute, and with reference to which the original nature is more a receptive than a productive power; though, possibly, human life might spring anew from an untaught infant colony.41 Thus, to a large extent, he finds the greatest influence on human nature to be those of the human environment; he does, how- ever, reserve a place for hereditary predispositions. One such is the tendency to virtue or vice. "I think, certainly, that some are born good and some bad, in a certain sense; that is, the most fundamental conditions of virtue, or the absence of them, are, or may be, inherited." More generally, he considered man's sensitivity heritable. He thought that "Great sensitiveness or capacity for enjoyment or suffering, with a memory of recall- ing vividly past pleasures and pains, are natural endowments leading to prudence and power of sympathy."42 If merely the tendency to virtue is inheritable, while most moral factors are environmentally determined, there is no room for a belief in an innate moral sense. Wright differed sharply from Alfred Russell Wallace in grounding moral values in social utility. The existence of feelings of approval and disapproval, or of likings and aversions to certain classes of actions, and a sense of obligation, are eminently useful in the government of human society, even among savages. These feelings may be associated with the really 40 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 20o8-2o9; to Miss Jane Norton, November 2o, 1870. 41 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 153-154; to Miss Grace Norton, July 17, 1869. 42 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 167; to Miss Jane Norton, February 26, 1870.</page><page sequence="14">508 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY useful and the really harmful classes of actions, or they may not be. Such associations are not determined simply by utility, any oftener than beliefs are by proper evidence. But utility tends to produce the proper associations; and in this ... consists the moral progress of the race.... Moral feelings, or the motives to the observance of rules of conduct, lie at the foundation of even the simplest human society, and rest directly on the utility of man's political nature.48 Again, if moral criteria are to be sought in the social utility of men's actions, the drive of the nineteenth century to im- prove man's material environment may, in the judgment of posterity, be fully as significant as the effort of the "old cathedral-builders" to improve man's spiritual environment. Wright saw, at about the same time as Henry Adams did, the great contrast between the dominant motives of the middle ages and of the nineteenth century. Where Adams, however, felt himself willy-nilly a nineteenth century man, living in the age of power, but in fundamental sympathy with the age of love, Wright belonged temperamentally to his own age and was gladly, rather than "desperately" a naturalist. "Some of the leading spirits of our times are as disinterested and devoted, and find in their aims, whether in politics, industry, or science, as powerful a stimulus to noble passion as the leaders of that age." 44 In fact, material advance may well be "the monument of our age, the religious edifice" on which thousands have lab- ored with mind and hands. It is noble disinterestedness that converts the narrowly selfish action into the moral act. Posterity will see the money of the rich and the labor of the poor, or all that remains of either, glorified in the monuments, whethler religious or utilitarian, whether material ones dedicated to imma- terial interests, or immaterial ones dedicated to material interests, that commemorate the nobly disinterested, or the few that really live for mankind.45 48 Wright, "The Limits of Natural Selection; a review of A.

Mere earnestness should, as a matter of fact, be distrusted because it tends to be dogmatic and authorita- rian, "the result of that love for mankind which takes the form of reverence for teachers, or of following the supposed divine in human examples," 47 and because an increase in the intens- ity of the feeling of earnestness does not necessarily indicate a greater degree of certainty of the moral principles involved. The application of this practical test of the social utility of moral behavior does not make a cut-and-dried calculus of the moral life. There is still place for human interest, human love, and human self-sacrifice. The self-sacrifice, when it is made, must not be blind. Wright quotes in one letter a remark of Professor Gurney of Harvard, "It is easy to die for an idea when we have but one."48 Some months later, he wrote to the same friend a phrase which suggests that he believed much presumed self-sacrifice to be really selfish sacrifice: "The idea for which it is easy to die, if we have only it, is not the idea of our special service, but of its chief end." 49 He shows an appre- ciation of the beauty of self-immolation for an idea, especially with regard to the past. "Such refining or aesthetic views are easy in historical perspective. The grand cathedral hides the squalid hovel. But the refining process cannot be applied by 46 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 186; to Miss Grace Norton, July 16, 187o. 47 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 29o; to Miss Grace Norton, August 12, 1874. 48 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 183; to Miss Grace Norton, March 25, 1870. 49 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 189; to Miss Grace Norton, July 16, 1870.</page><page sequence="16">510 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY the living to their own age." 50 Thus Wright's sharper vision saw what Henry Adams failed, by his own confession, to see: the hovel behind the cathedral, our inability to gain perspec- tive on our own age. The meanness, the corruption, the vice of it, meet [the living] at every turn. That these are really less than in past times, and that great resources of moral energy, less conspicuous, but not less real, are guiding it toward a better future cannot be made clear to the imagination and can only be evidenced by dry comparative statis- tics to the utilitarian understanding.52 Chauncey was too hard-headed a utilitarian to be anything but a believer in progress. His balance could not have been upset by the second law of thermodynamics; he would have said of that what he said of other scientific ideas: "There are morals to be drawn from science as well as a science from morals." 2 Moreover, Chauncey insisted on the relationship between the esteem in which moral sacrifice was held and the value placed on the sacrifice by both judge and sacrificer. "This be- longs to our utilitarian moral nature."53 A sacrifice which is not real is "morally ineffective"; a fictitious ideal is "morally inert." "A myth which has ceased to command faith is morally dead." 54 He did not think that the principle of utility com- manded so weak an assent as to fall under the class of the morally inert, because this principle calls attention to the ulti- mate end, rather than to itself or its operation, and thereby draws its strength from the end. "The practical strength of this principle depends on how much we regard or prize the ultimate standard. . . . The actual practical strength of utilitarian morality comes to depend on how steadily we can think under strong feeling, or on how strongly we can feel with clear 50 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 183; to Miss Grace Norton, March 25, 1870o. 51 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 183; to Miss Grace Norton, March 25, 1870. 52 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 256; to Miss Grace Norton [January, 1874]. 53 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 185; to Miss Grace Norton, March 25, 1870o. 54 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 185.</page><page sequence="17">CHAUNCEY WRIGHT: RADICAL EMPIRICIST 511 thought."'55 As he says in another letter to Norton, which is largely a brilliant though brief essay on utilitarianism, "Utility does not oppose itself .. . to the proper jurisdiction of feeling. ... Its philosophy does not contend for the sanction of utility as the sole and sufficing motive to conduct. It only proposes a standard as the proper test - a negative test it may be - of every motive." 56 In terms such as those used by Wright when he discusses the principles of utility, some of the conventional moral rules re- tain their force because on analysis they appear to be "quite simple corollaries from obvious conditions of well-being and the fundamental axiom of the greatest good." The dictates of conscience ("strong and controlling aversions to certain classes of actions and admirations or approvals of other classes") should be respected, even though there may be instances in which following the dictates of conscience may lead to undesir- able action, "since a faulty conscience is more useful or less harmful on the whole than unprincipled conduct." 57 Thus the substitution of the sanction of utility for the sanctions of in- tuitive morality produce, for the most part, no change in posi- tive moral behavior patterns; the substitution has value be- cause of its elimination of prejudices, iniquities, and absurdi- ties which are justified by intuitive sanctions. Another point at which Wright's moral views lean toward the conventional, intuitional type of ethics rather than towards theoretical, rational, or what he calls "metaphysical" ethics is on the question of the limitations of human responsibility. This question arose incidentally in an extended discussion of language changes incorporated in Chauncey's correspondence with Charles Darwin in 1872. Darwin asserted in one letter, and Wright accepted in part the idea that intended conse- quences only are ascribable to man's agency, that human re- 55 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 223-224; to Norton, May 8, 1871. 56 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 194; to Norton, August io, 1870o. 57 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 196.</page><page sequence="18">512 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY sponsibility is limited by human intentions. The change on which Wright insisted and for which he argued was the recog- nition of a wider area of human intentions; not what the indi- vidual knew as his intention, but what he ought to have known determines his responsibility. Hence the sphere of human freedom and responsibility, though extending beyond what is actually foreseen as the consequences of our actions, is still within the limit of what might and ought to be known as the consequences of our actions; that is, either specifically foreseen, or implicitly contained in a moral principle, instinct, precept, or commandment. In other words, this sphere is limited to the objects and means of moral discipline.58 By moral discipline, he meant "the question for what men as moral agents are rationally condemned or approved, punished or rewarded." 59 The question of rewards and punishments is a significant one, for moral conduct is more usually based upon them, than upon the natural, direct results of the conduct. That is to say, the individual experiences utility more frequently in the re- wards or punishments arising because of his actions than in the consequences of the action.60 Any weakness of the motive to perform the moral act or any inherent weakness of the moral agent must be compensated for by the extrinsic utility of re- wards and punishments. "The rationale of rewards and pun- ishments has to do with the use of them, and involves essen- tially the short-comings of the agent, or the feebleness of mo- tives to actions, as well as the absolute value of the actions themselves." 61 From what has been said it is evident that, in his moral thinking, Wright was largely influenced by the thought of the 58 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 243; to Charles Darwin, August 29, 1872.

The idea of progress, optimistic and based on the doctrine of infinite human perfectibility in the Enlightenment, had become in Chauncey Wright an idea of determinate change, unconnected with human volitions or de- sires. The Christian and Platonist belief in fixed moral princi- ples whether grounded in revelation or in any other moral ab- solute had given way to a belief in moral relativism sanctioned by the principle of utility. The doctrine of infinite human perfectibility had been one of the speculative premises of the belief in democracy.62 For Wright, democracy, liberty, and equality were not deductions from a transcendental principle of human evolution; they were simply facts of the situation in which he lived. Universal suf- frage, for example, he called "a present fate, mixed of good and evil - a thing neither to seek nor to avoid, but of which we must make the best." 63 He had no faith in the intelligence of the public. "The masses in all ages are led by the few in all that raises them much above the level of animal wants. Their moral powers are chiefly comprised under the principles of imitation and authority or in the faculties of following and obeying." 64 On the other hand, he was not an opponent of democracy; he regarded "the anti-democratic Macaulayan doctrine (I may say misapprehension) of democratic tendencies as not less un- philosophical and sentimental than such stupid worship of mere numbers." 65 In fact, he recognized that "Against the fal- lacies of divine rights, whether in kings or capitalists, the fal- lacies of liberty and equality are good thunder; and, so long as force is an efficient means of supporting or overthrowing con- victions, they are legitimate arguments." 66 62 See, for example, the last two books of Joel Barlow's Columbiad. 63 Philosophical Discussions, 57. 64 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 183-184; to Miss Grace Norton, March 25, 1870. 65 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 174; to Norton, March 21, 1870. 66 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 192; to Norton, August io, 187o.</page><page sequence="20">514 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY Wright neither accepted nor rejected the political stereo- types of his era; he approached the economic platitudes of his day in a similarly independent fashion. He could never have said, with Ralph Waldo Emerson's aunt, Miss Mary Moody Emerson, "I respect in a rich man the order of Providence." 67 He was, however, in general, a believer in at least the potential social utility of the individual wealth produced by a capitalistic economy. Looked at rationally and from a utilitarian point of view, the rights of private ownership, the protection of the individual in the possession, accumulation, consumption, productive administra- tion, and posthumous disposal of his surplus gain, - is founded simply and solely in the motives they afford to his making such gains, and adding them, as he really does (in spite of his seeming private appropriation of them), to the store of public wealth.68 "In the long run, the privileges of wealth - that is, most of them - conduce to the benefit of society." 69 He saw nothing inherently immoral, in his age, in the pur- suit of wealth. He argued by implication against the doctrine that "It is as easy for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle as for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven." In fact, he found wealth the greatest of moral potentials. "Our great men are the wise and painstaking promoters and guardians of ex- tensive interests. They show moral greatness in fitness for great responsibilities which the needs of a highly organized society may impose upon them."'70 Here again, his historical relativism made it impossible for him to express this belief as a conclusion valid for any age but his own. There were times when the relations of men to wealth, to its acqui- sition and administration, were inconsistent with the highest type 67 Quoted by Perry Miller, "Jonathan Edwards to Emerson," NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY, XIII, 614 (December, 1940). 68 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 173; to Norton, March 21, 1870. 69 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 186; to Miss Grace Norton, July 16, 1870. 70 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 171; to Norton, March 21, 1870o.</page><page sequence="21">CHAUNCEY WRIGHT: RADICAL EMPIRICIST 515 of character and were instinctively shunned as an impertinence and a moral obstacle; but for the modern man to seek the kingdom of heaven by this road would be like seeking to resemble a man of genius by imitating his eccentricities.... There were times in which the problem of noble life demanded for its solution a greater con- centration and singleness of purpose, - even an escape from "the world," - and the consideration of fewer objects of a universal and disinterested character than are embraced in the moral scope of to- day. These conditions gave to the controlling ideas much more the character of ruling passions, and even led to the insane forms of moral action or to fanaticisms.71 "Since feudalism and the slave-trade no longer confer titles of property," wealth was no longer to be shunned. It provided the opportunity for active beneficence; this could not be actual- ized without "the heart of charity, and the head, too." But, to the extent that it provided such opportunity, "wealth appears in the most honorable relation it can sustain to the problem of noble living." 72 Although Wright recognized the moral potentialities of wealth, he also was cognizant of its possibilities for moral and social evil. "The rapacity of wealth is, of course the taproot of all these evils, the source of the hostility which threatens social revolutions." The privileges of wealth need not be considered "as if they were absolute rights, with no ulterior foundation." They "ought to be - will have to be - circumscribed," though "it is perhaps unfortunate that the problem of amending the laws of property will have to be solved through democratic agencies and the unavoidable ascendency of the will of the masses in political matters." 73 He offered the suggestion which recent developments have shown to be highly impractical that the curtailment of privilege should be self-imposed, that "a moral aristocracy among the wealthy should admit to its free- dom no one who uses his claims on the public goods for costly 71 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 182-183; to Miss Grace Norton, March 25, 1870. 72 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 188; to Miss Grace Norton, July 16, 1870o. 78 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 173, 174; to Norton, March 21, 1870.</page><page sequence="22">516 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY and entirely selfish gratifications." 74 At the same time, he rec- ognized the need for the support by government and people of agrarian wealth. "One fatal mistake would be in not sustaining the class of prosperous and independent yeomanry, the true backbone of civilized communities as now constituted." 75 In sum, Wright's views on wealth and property, although they differed sharply from the Calvinistic and Pauline views of the earlier American tradition," tended to the same general conclusions. Riches, if not an indication of divine election, were an indication of natural selection, with not too different an effect on society or on the rich man himself. Perhaps the best summary was given by Wright himself: I do not entirely like the figure of "stewardship," as defining the relations of the rich man to society. What he, in fact, possesses in our modern economy is the right to dispose, for his own gratifica- tion, of a certain portion of the property, the actual goods, which industry is constantly creating or employing. If he refrains from using this privilege, it is the same for the time being as if he had given all his possessions back to society. His money, in the hands of his banker, is circulated by loans; and his houses and lands are occupied and used just as if he did not exist. As a rich man, he is simply one who has the power to take of the goods offered for ulti- mate exchange as much as he pleases, up to the limits of his so-called possessions. He may consume these goods himself, or give them to be consumed by his beneficiaries; but he is not properly a steward simply as a rich man. He is more exactly a butler. As the creator of his fortune, or as a business administrator, through whom the wealth is increased by the appliances of industry, he is properly called a steward, and in that capacity is as useful and honorable a citizen as the merely rich man can be. Beyond that, his powers and means of doing good are very limited, nothing comparable to his apparent powers as a benefactor, or his real powers as a consumer. ?7 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 186; to Miss Grace Norton, July 16, 1870. 75 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 173; to Norton, March 21, 1870. 76 As detailed, for example, by Merle Curti, The Growth of American Thought (New York, 1943), 68-70, and Joseph Dorfman, The Economic Mind in American Civilization (New York, 1946).</page><page sequence="23">CHAUNCEY WRIGHT: RADICAL EMPIRICIST 517 His peculiar duties to a society as a merely rich man are chiefly negative, and are involved in the obligation not to do the harm he has it in his power to do, - not to waste the goods he has at his com- mand, and not to diminish the productive use of his wealth by the industrious.77 In Chauncey Wright's letters we have sought and found the expressions of a vigorous and original mind on several ques- tions of moral and social thought: the relation between mo- rality and religion, the nature and sanctions of morality, and the basis and obligations of wealth. On these themes, Wright appears as a utilitarian, an agnostic, and a radical empiricist even where his analysis reenforces traditional views. In the clar- ity of his analysis of the questions of moral sanction and of the obligation of property, there is an indication of the reason such diverse friends as Fiske, Peirce, and James found him stimulat- ing. It is fortunate for our understanding of this man that, as he himself realized and affirmed, "the chief end of morals... seems to be to afford topics for my letters!" 78 77 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 186-187; to Miss Grace Norton, July 16, 1870. 78 Letters of Chauncey Wright, 304; to Miss Jane Norton [September, 1874].</page></plain_text>
