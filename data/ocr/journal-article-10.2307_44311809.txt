<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christianity and Literature Vol. 39, No. 3 (Spring 1990) DIALOGUE Wise as Serpents, Harmless as Doves: Christians and Contemporary Critical Theory Bruce L. Edwards Branson L. Woodard, Jr. It is unseemly, perhaps, to open a discussion of the role and meaning of Christian literary criticism by speaking of motive. However, in keeping with the spirit of free inquiry inaugurated by Christianity and Literature's "Dialogue" section, we feel compelled to begin this essay with some account of our respective personal commitments. Our window on the world and on criticism is shaped by our evangelical upbringing and our belief in a high view of the Bible as inspired, inerrant, and authoritative. In short, our way of "writing and reading the world" is framed by certain theological allegiances and conceptions of the kingdom of God. These presuppositions are inevitably revealed in our response to certain strains of contemporary critical theory. If one believes, as we do, that the most important consideration in the adoption of any theory or critical tool is how it may further or impede the establishment of the kingdom of God, how it may affect our understand- ing of the gospel, and how it may ultimately determine the way we treat other creatures whom we are called to love and serve, certain matters follow. Neutrality in critical method for the Christian is impossible, for the opposite of neutrality is not necessarily bias but conviction, soul- deep persuasion founded upon a corpus of fact. Greater and higher laws guide Christian academics than the editorial policies of avant-garde critical journals, and personal ambition and motive become crucial concerns. God speaks or scripts; either we can hear and heed, or we cannot. What does critical theory have to say about this preeminent and paradigmatic issue? Inseparable from the discussion of this or that critical method is what that method implies about our ability to discern - and obey - the meaning of God's text. Whatever principles govern our reading of Rousseau 303</page><page sequence="2">304 Bruce I. Edwards and Branson L. Woodard, Jr. or Heidegger must also govern our reading of Moses or Luke or Paul. It is reported that Jesus Christ claimed to be the Way, the Truth, and the life: is this textual testimony reliable and determinate? To ignore this ques- tion, it seems to us, is to risk undermining the very possibility of knowing God. And yet in the ebb and flow of Christian response to critical theory in the last decade, especially as represented in CCL circles, we discover few references to Scripture. There is, in fact, a surprising neglect of informed appeal to the Bible itself for instruction about the ways texts mean - how symbols can convey or fail to convey the presence and meaning of God's revelation. Further, it is passing strange to note how seldom Christian commentators have referred to rabbinical tradition, to the Church Fa- thers, or even to present-day exegetes of Scripture in their consideration of semiotic issues. This is all the more puzzling given the fact that there areanumberofworthy writers andscholars from many traditions (though, admittedly, not often operating in the domain of critical theory per se) who have developed or are developing coherent theories of symboliza- tion and textuality informed by this rich biblical tradition. Such writers include novelist Walker Percy, linguist Kenneth L. Pike, and theologians such as John Frame, James B. Jordan, Vern S. Poythress, and Alexander Schmemann. We understand that the Christian critic tends to be an oxymoron, an anomaly among his secular colleagues - one who must try to straddle the boundary between two kingdoms. Such is not an easy task, and we would not trivialize either its difficulty or its danger. The authority to which the Christian as critic must often appeal to have the respect of his colleagues and to publish in elite journals forces him at times to disguise, downplay, or perhaps even unwittingly compromise his allegiance to Scripture. His very presence in the academy threatens to alienate him from and make his work suspect to his uninitiated brethren. Whatishetodo? Noonecan serve two masters. Such a predicament leads us to broach two critical, if impolite, ques- tions at the outset of our essay. Could it be that, living the dualistic life that scholarly endeavor often portends, some have embraced critical tools and theories oblivious to the possible contradictions between the prac- tice of criticism and the practice of faith? Could it be that some Christian critics, driven by the understandable desire to be taken seriously by secular critics and editors, have forged unequal, perhaps unholy, alli- ances with theorists whose covert sympathies lie ultimately with the destruction or devaluation of biblical orthodoxy? Wolves among Sheep. We raise these questions not because we are above the temptations they imply, but because we sense an emerging ambivalence about their cogency and relevance to current discussion.</page><page sequence="3">Wise as Serpents, Harmless as Doves 305 Accordingto some recent CCL commentators, too many Christian critics, as well as Christian faculty in general, have been captive of a lingering, ill- bred formalism that promotes an unsophisticated genre of sacramental- ist criticism and, worse, prevents them from realizing some of the thera- peutic effects of the new epistemologies and reading techniques avail- able under the umbrella of deconstruction. They discern in some readers of and contributors to Christianity and Literature an unwelcome and unhealthy nostalgia for a time when the enterprise of literary criticism seemed more pious and less dominated by theory. The truth is that large numbers of readers in contemporary criticism are surfeited by the claims and counterclaims of that new hybrid among us, the "criticist," who spends as much time ruminating about how or whether a "text" exists as he does writing to illuminate the meaning of the work itself. Our very description of this phenomenon begins, of course, to betray our own assessment of the critical landscape and the route the Christian should take in negotiating its labyrinthine pathways. Whether it is meaningful to speak of something identifiable as the "work itself' is a question at the heart of much contemporary debate. This seeming anachronism betrays the circumstances of our own entry into the realm of critical theory, an entry made possible through the door of rhetoric, through the mundane portal of teaching freshman English and imagin- ing better ways of doing it. For we saw in this once-despised curriculum an opportunity to rehabilitate the common rhetorical notions of author- ship, intention, meaning, and so on for our apprentice writers. Thereby we were in a position to compose a more biblical foundation for the teaching of literacy skills, for study of literature, and for the critical enterprise as a whole. Such opportunity still exists, we believe, but not if Christians are content to subject the biblical world view to secularist editing - instead of the reverse. Once upon a time literary criticism seemed to comprise a fairly precise set of principles and strategies designed to illuminate the meaning of a poem, story, or drama. Its tools were primarily historical, philological, and biographical research, and its practitioners approached a given literary text with the intention of interpreting it for a particular audience in light of its original context. It could be said that in a sense most literary critics operated under the assumption that, in fact, they had no "assump- tions" as such but rather shared some common-sense, even universal, notions about what the literary enterprise involved and what the critic's task entailed. Critics served the role of "translator" for their less informed audiences, filling in the gaps of knowledge, perspective, and experience for readers who might otherwise miss, without their assistance, the "significance" of a given work. The practice of literary criticism thus often rested upon the view that</page><page sequence="4">306 Bruce L. Edwards and Branson L. Woodard, Jr. each literary work, when plumbed properly, revealed a coherent, even univocal, meaning and that, even when differences about meaning appeared among critics, there was at least an assumed range of preferred or possible interpretations that eventual debate would weed out or secure. To be a "critic" was to bring to a text all of the resources at hand in order to understand and explicate the meaning an author had deliber- ately placed there. Above all, criticism was seen as a preeminently practical discipline that dealt specifically with texts and authors and how they were to be understood. It is not too much to say that up until the first third of the twentieth century a majority of literary critics worldwide understood their task as answering this basic set of questions about a literary work: (1) Who wrote this work and why? (2) What does this work mean? (3) What lexical and historical information does one need to gather to properly interpret it? and (4) Is this work to be valued in itself or on some other basis? However, as we all know, the focus of professional literary scholarship has shifted dramatically in the last half century from the seemingly disinterested process of reading and explicating literary works to the pursuit of literary theories intended to illuminate how language and texts function in a culture. The older view of literary criticism as a common- sense matter of deriving meaning from a work is now widely regarded as a naive, essen- tialist viewpoint that does not take seriously enough the complexity and problematic features of human communication. If the discipline of literary criticism referred to the practical matter of reading and interpret- ing texts with help from dictionaries, historical inquiry, and empirical notions about an author's intention and readers' expectations, then the new regime of critical theory might be said to refer to the study of the relationships within the processes of writing and reading - in short, how the construction and consumption of texts reflect and shape the issues of power, authority, and control in society. The new criticists, as we characterize them, wrestle not so much with the meaning of individual texts as with the notion of textuality itself- the meaningfulness of the claim that a written text can in anyway be said to faithfully represent reality, a reality that is apprehensible without bias and not already embedded in an interpretive context that makes objec- tivity impossible. Unlike their predecessors, the criticists attempt to address a different set of questions: (1) What constitutes the notion of a "literary" text? (2) Where does meaning inhere in the reading act - in the text itself, the reader, the author, or the cultural setting in which it is situated? (3) Can texts be stable and fixed in meaning over time and culture? and (4) Can language itself refer to an objective reality beyond itself? In incorporating these momentous epistemologica! issues into the</page><page sequence="5">Wise as Serpents, Harmless as Doves 307 business of literary criticism, criticists turn to disciplines outside of traditional literary inquiry- psychology, philosophy, anthropology, and linguistics among them - as never before, challenging the long- held and comfortable commonplaces about the roles of authors and readers within the processes of creating and deciphering the meaning of texts. In the aftermath of their ascendancy, reading can no longer reasona- bly be considered a politically innocent act; readers bring to a text a set of assumptions, biases, and culturally based attitudes that inevitably color their interpretation. Thus, criticists have by turns declared the irrele- vance of the author to both the creative and the interpretive process, affirmed the authority of interpretive communities over the interpreta- tions of individual readers, and questioned the reliability and relevance of the notion of a historically "stable" text. Is there any place for the Christian critic to stand within the midst of this new project? Into the Labyrinth. For us the history of critical theory begins, prop- erly, in the Garden of Eden. There certain hermeneutical issues are foregrounded in Adam and Eve's relationship to God and to the meaning of his word. In the third chapter of Genesis the Serpent interrogates Eve in an attempt to undermine her linguistic confidence in interpreting what God had made known to her through human language, her fidelity in understanding what he intended by his instruction, and her security in believing that he could be trusted with her well-being. We hear the Serpent sneer, "Did you hear him correctly? Can you trust your interpre- tation? Aren't his motives just a little suspect?" Translation: is your naive trust in the "metaphysics of presence" a reliable basis for interpretation? The Serpent is here not merely some proto-Socrates attempting to establish or solidify the woman's grasp of what she claims to know. Misery loves company. As the first critical theorist, the Serpent desires to destroy Eve's basic trust in the adequacy of language to convey God's meaning. The fixedness of the order of things and relationships chafes against him; he holds out the false hope that rebellion against God may yet succeed but, if not, best to ruin or thwart God's plans, ringing the curtain down on the "human experiment." By coercing Eve and, through Eve, Adam to abstract themselves from the sure province of accessible, and therefore determinate, language, the Serpent compels them to reject God's gift of fellowship and presence. By compelling them to stand momentarily outside themselves as autono- mous lords of being and of knowledge, he drives a wedge between their human nature and their divine origin. The mechanism for this betrayal is his predication of deification based purely on the knowledge of good and evil - on gnosis or intelligence, a lifting up of the finite into the infinite by a leap of the intellect. The history of the race thereafter is a sad chronicle of men and women in their sin</page><page sequence="6">308 Bruce L. Edwards and Branson L. Woodard, Jr. unable to deal with their finitude, their creatureliness. In our post-Edenic twentieth century the revolt against finiteness continues, and it is mani- fested often in and through this pursuit of linguistically based gnosis, a knowledge, so to speak, behind God's back that might permit humanity to sustain itself without him. From our viewpoint such a gnosticism is no better exemplified than in the rise of critical theory as a dominant preoccupation within academia today, particularly in its incarnation as deconstruction. Its most obvious roots are in Saussure's posthumously published lecture notes and par- ticularly in one dogma attributed to him that undergirds much linguistic and literary confusion at the end of the twentieth century: the contention that hearers identify sounds and "make meaning" not by recognizing any positive, unique features that particular sounds possess but by distin- guishing the differences between sounds. Meaning thus becomes a product of differentiation, not of identification, a point not lost on the Serpent in the Garden. In other words, to Saussure's interpreters both sounds and signs - and the mean- ings attached to them - are seen as arbitrary. Their "meaning" is not located in the sound or the word on the page but in the immediate context of speaker and audience. The "B-ness" of the consonant "B" is an illusion; one "knows" B as B because it is not "P" or "T, " and thus not because there are discernible features that intrinsically comprise the sound or semantic value of B. Language does not, then, point beyond itself to an objective reality but deflects reference to itself within a closed sound or sign system. If one accepts the notion that language is a closed system of differen- tiation, then certain propositions follow: texts and other language expe- riences that appear to be "about" reality - which appear to "contain" meaning that can be "extracted" - are really only about the language system itself. Claude Lévi-Strauss and Michel Foucault, among others, have applied this doctrine to various cultural phenomena, any of which may be conceptualized as "texts," products of signifying systems - inter- nally consistent, self-enclosed, and in no direct relationship to external reality. Since meaning is not inherent in the sounds or signs that com- prise them, reality-making is a binary process of cultural negotiation and interaction; reality is understood not as an attribute of or a presence in discourse, or as an utterance that corresponds with a state of affairs in the world at large, but rather is viewed solely as an elusive product of a tenuous consensus within a community of speakers, readers, or writers. More radical poststructuralists then may take the deconstructive turn: a text never quite "means what it says" because, given the arbitrary nature of language, a text is always saying more than one thing, undermining its own claims to presence and to fixed meaning; it is always pointing away from itself to other sounds, other signs, other texts. One of the more</page><page sequence="7">Wise as Serpents, Harmless as Doves 309 widely shared conclusions from these new theoretical premises is thus that "there is no 'outside of the text'" - that is, no outside context or boundary to interpretation beyond an ephemeral community consen- sus. Readers are therefore denied any normative interpretation to which they might appeal for corroboration of their readings. After all, the argument continues, there is no "transcendental signified," no outside reference point that could end the play of difference and lock meaning into place in discourse. "Comprehension" is deferred indefinitely into an infinite regress wherein no interpretation can be final or determinate. It is clear that the ongoing platform of deconstruction, then, is to upset the easy, naive acceptance of the epistemological claims of Western literacy and the powers it traditionally bestows upon textuality, waylay- ing its notion of the possibility of direct apprehension of truth. Its triumphal side effect is to establish theory as such an essential and compelling component of the study of literature that, in fact, "theory" displaces the "narrative" of authors and texts. These premises indubita- bly yield a counter-historiography, whose aggression against the bibli- cal world view is barely concealed. Since the industrialized West erro- neously assumes that language - as speech or text - can be immediate, the foundations of traditional criticism and its credibility are flattened under the philosophical disintegration of its own naive notions of speech and writing. Harvesting Chaff. Many have defended this counter-historiography on the basis of its supposed and innumerable salutary effects; after all, its apologists remind us, habituation of thought can often be as much an enemy of clarity and conviction as random selection, and Christianity has often been betrayed by its close association with pagan Western philoso- phy. Thus, some Christian critics have persuasively argued that in its most innocent form deconstruction should be reckoned as simply a project to deal with the finiteness of human knowledge and the subjectiv- ity of perception. It is an inquiry, if you will, into the influence of a culture or tribe's dominant presuppositions on what and how we know things, as revealed both in specific texts and in an entire culture's response to textuality. This new focus seres to expose to our view the contingent nature of what we regard as knowledge and challenges our easy equation of words with things-in-themselves, thereby freeing us from the idolatry of the word. Consequently, deconstruction, including its permutations in Marxist and feminist critical practice, is said to service the discerning critic with potentially fresh reading strategies with which to examine the (now revealed) multidimensionality of texts for their internal ironies, para- doxes, and ambiguities, purposefully moving the reader to attend more perspicaciously to a text's evoked or implicit world view. We are asked to</page><page sequence="8">310 Bruce L. Edwards and Branson L. Woodard, Jr. conclude that, as we alter or suspend our too doctrinaire notions of authorship and textuality, we are enabled finally to meet texts - includ- ing, often, the Bible itself - on their own terms. Even conceding all this, however, the question that many observers - Christian and non- Chris- tian alike - feel constrained to ask of Derrida, Inc., is: what are we giving up in surrendering Western literacy out of hand, the long-held notion that words can bear faithful witness to reality? If one embraces the view that all "interpretation" is interested, "always-already" inseparable from and inextricably embedded in an ideological framework, what follows? The rhetorical situation for traditionalist critics, deconstructionists, and those Christians caught between them who try to respond to these queries is highly problematical. In the last half of the twentieth century critics and theorists from many camps have grappled with the allegation that ideology irreducibly informs, colors, and disarms writers and read- ers. Many would affirm that by leveling the foundations of all human thought to ideology one is somehow liberating oppressed, formerly dis- enfranchised, readers and writers, unshackling them from arbitrary cul- tural constraints. If all is ideological, no one need prove the logic or verifiability of one's propositions; "control" is seemingly returned to discoursers or their community, who no longer must ground their "truths" or allegiances in someone else's metaphysics but rather are freed to enter the heroic struggle for an "empowered" authorship and readership with new weaponry. To put the predicament in the terms we believe most crucial to Christian critics, what seems to animate late-twentieth-century criticism is not the expectation or joy of inhabiting a particular writer's world or even confronting an alternative anthropology, but a principled and coer- cive pluralism. Multiplicity and diversity have emerged as values in their own right and as virtually the sole criteria by which canons and curricula may be evaluated. Among its more benign expositors such a pluralism is said to promote human dignity and to create canonical room for other, more diverse "realities" to be invented, explored, and valued. While humankind may have much in common, significant ethnic, cultural, and gender differences exist that should not be eradicated in some homog- enization of taste or perspective but rather preserved, privileged, and celebrated. Among others less enamored of these democratic senti- ments, this pluralism implies something more sinister: the reader's entrapment in the prison-house of language, dooming him as well to the prison-house of individual personhood. We learn that as readers we are at best unwilling to transcend, and at worst incapable of transcending, the narrow confines of culture, gender, religion, class, and race that have nurtured us; we may see and hear only what we or our interpretive community permits us to hear and see.</page><page sequence="9">Wise as Serpents, Harmless as Doves 311 We would surmise that even among Christians who believe that con- temporary criticists have performed a valuable service in clearing away the empirical bias of the post-Enlightenment West, there remain some nagging and essential questions about just how ultimately beneficial such critiques may be. Just how creditably can such hostile witness help one to fashion and embrace a more faithful, biblical method of criticism? In the past Christian critics, like most critics, saw their task as eliminating plural responses, as narrowing the reader's line of sight until one or only a few possibilities of understanding remained. Here the full scandal of the Cross confronts us. The Jesus of Scripture is no pluralist; his rejection and crucifixion are ordained by his steadfast refusal to court consensus or to accommodate those who would displace the center with the margin. If what the criticists say is true, how dare we take into the marketplace of ideas this offensive, particularist message of a unique Savior who died and rose again for all times, peoples, and cultures? We conclude that however cordially one greets deconstruction's radi- cal enterprise one must acknowledge that it creates a critical vacuum, one which the concerned Christian critic hastens to fill with a responsible epistemology that honors the God of the Bible and that will assist, not deter, readers trying to fathom the meaning of a text in front of them. Consequently, the most compelling question facing the Christian critic at the end of the twentieth century is how to wade into the debris left by the dismantling of Western literacy and to reconstruct a compelling, coher- ent biblical platform from which to understand how meaning operates in human endeavors. Wise as Serpents. Where does one begin such a task? We would offer the following preliminary counsel. First, we must refuse to be reaction- ary, always scurrying into a corner to recast our faith and rationality in terms of the presuppositions of the secular antagonists of Christianity. We must first understand - and be certain that we do understand - the biblical premises of divine and human communication before we can feel justified in employing avowedly non-biblical theories and tools. It is not at all clear that present Christian critics have in fact done that homework. But it must be done. In ourviewthe Bible alone affordsus the secure ontological and epistemological bases for understanding the foundations of reliable human communication. All else is sinking sand. Second, we must resist the temptation to embrace the gnosticism so pervasive in our academic culture and in the world at large. Gnosticism is that dualism of mind and body, of spirit and corporeality, that plagued the early Church and that remains with us to this day in the form of an intellectualism that replaces a theocentric universe with an anthropo- centric one. Autonomous human reason is now enthroned in our meth- odologies to the extent that we claim to uncover an infinity of relevant</page><page sequence="10">312 Bruce L. Edwards and Branson L. Woodard, Jr. detail within and surrounding every human text - what Leland Ryken has referred to as "the myth of complexity." This cumulative detail, compris- ing a towering mountain of exhaustive and, thus, unscaleable informa- tion for all but the omniscient reader, is then equated with the "meaning" of the text. Unable to fathom such a "deep" text, the finite reader retreats from the task of understanding its essential truth and meaning and settles for its impaling on the tendentious tableau of gender, race, and class. The Christian, of course, acknowledges the seriousness of the claim to "know what a text means" but responds that exhaustive knowledge is neither possible nor necessary for faithful interpretation in the light of biblical revelation. These dramatically exaggerated notions of what comprises a text serve only to reveal the criticist's ignorance of biblical anthropology. The personal- infinite God created us in his image and thus capable of negotiating the world with the senses and intellect we possess; we are capable of responding to God - and to each other - by virtue of the mind, body, soul, and spirit he designed specifically for that task. To elaborate this point, in our view, the Bible declares that, first in conversation and later in writing, human creatures are invited to partici- pate in the discernment and dissemination of knowledge by means of texts. By extension, these creatures are permitted and expected to em- ploy language in all of their temporal relationships. By speaking with Adam and Eve directly in the Garden, by inscripturating his revelation at Mount Sinai, and, ultimately, by the incarnation of his Son, God reveals that his character and purposes may be known - that is, presented in history by means of human language. The reality of God's presence in the world and in the life of the individual is apprehended, however, only in the full participation and action of a person in the world. The gospel of salvation consists of words, a text that comprises and conveys the action of Jesus Christ in history on behalf of the world. When that text is written, believed in the heart of the individual, and acted upon, she is "trans- lated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light." Simply put, human language, as modeled in the cross-linguistic success of the preaching of the gospel in the first century, is adequate to the tasks to which God has assigned it. Third, the Christian must deny that language systems are ultimately or essentially arbitrary. Sound and sign systems - language - are "arbi- trary" only in the sense that they "could have been otherwise" in God's sovereign purpose. A biblical "grammatology" thus asserts that speak- ing, listening, writing, and reading should be seen as stewardship activi- ties that allow God's image-bearers to act upon the world, to control and refine it, to "authorize" interpretations of it, and as such they are arche- typal activities of God himself. Such a "logocentrism" is biblical in an</page><page sequence="11">Wise as Serpents, Harmless as Doves 313 originative sense, since it was God himself who spoke the universe into existence. We thus believe in a God who can and does communicate faithfully and authoritatively within the syntax and lexicon of human languages. Orality and literacy are not, therefore, merely anthropomorphic quali- ties but distinctive tools of humanness unavailable to other creatures, gifts of common grace that empower us to discover God's meaning in the world and in his word. If it is true, as Paul suggests in 1 Corinthians, that the "unspiritual" cannot discern reality as it is, human life and each individual life must be seen as texts written by God in history, and only those who walk in the community of faith, familiar with its features, are able to "write and read the world" responsibly and "in truth." Meaning is seen as the gift of God bestowed upon his people in history in interpéné- tration of the divine word lived out among the eschatologically cove- nanted community. We must never forget that non-Christian critical theory derives whatever explanatory power it has by being parasitic of the stability and order this covenant community has promoted in history. Fourth, the Christian will maintain that language works not only in differentiation and deferralbut also through identification and represen- tation - that is, through the complementary acts of naming and meton- ymy. This is a point that we cannot develop fully here. However, we can point the reader to "amateur semiotician" Walker Percy, who has called this phenomenon of language - the ability to name and to use language to point to physical reality - the "Delta factor." Percy's reference is to the linguistic miracle that occurred on a momentous day in 1887 in Tuscum- bia, Alabama, between Anne Sullivan and Helen Keller. No two-dimen- sional Saussurean dyadic model, Percy argues, can account for Keller's sudden apprehension of the symbol W-A-T-E-R as the name of the cool liquid spilled into her hands. Only the "Delta factor" offers the possibility of explanation. Percy concludes: U ndoubtedly there were three elements somehow involved in the event - Helen, the water, and the word water. But how? Whatwas the base of the triangle? What is the nature of the mysterious events in which one perceives that this (stufi) "is" water? What is the natural phenomenon signified by the simplest yet most opaque of all symbols, the little copula "is"? (40) Nothing within a given language system as known and analyzed by descriptive linguists can account for the denotative function of naming, of coming to know what something "is" and how something else can "stand for" it. Only a metaphysical account, pointing to some transcen- dent quality of human language and human being, can begin to adduce the underlying basis of Keller's achievement.</page><page sequence="12">314 Bruce L. Edwards and Branson L. Woodard, Jr. Harmless as Doves. Ultimately deconstruction, as attractive a tool as it may be for illuminating some texts, fails to provide an adequate meta- physical basis for understanding how God's texts convey meaning to us, and for the Christian this seems to us a fatal error. For we are com- manded, according to the apostle Paul, to "demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God . . . and to take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ" (2 Cor. 10:4- 5), a clear biblical warrant for the act of criticism itself and a declaration of its proper goal. The authority for critical methodology is ultimately not a dead author (or critic) but a living Person, always already knowing hearts, minds, and texts and making faultless judgments, hence implying for us the ongoing other- worldly/worldly nature of every critical act and, indeed, every act of cognition. Christ is himself the prototypical critic, whose own nature implies that an aesthetics of criticism has a moral basis and is predicted on our stewardship of the resources - environmental, intellectual, and spiri- tual - God has bestowed upon us in history. A poem or prose narrative belongs first to its creator, and so it remains. Accordingly, deconstruction- ist "play" is incredibly presumptuous. If written criticism, belonging of course to its author, proposes to illuminate another's work, how can it do so while denyingthepersonalorigin/authorshipof the text under consid- eration? If ignoring the authority of source is legitimate, no decon- structionist has an ontological basis for defending her own critique. Ultimately, the stubborn fact of the divine inspiration of Scripture, apparently seen by some criticists as a pointless fiction or a bothersome irrelevance, must loom large thematically in discussions of critical the- ory. Indeed, the paradigm of God's inscripturation and incarnation have weighty implications for the rehabilitation of authorial intention, logo- centrism, textual authority, intention as meaning, reading as initially receptive rather than creative - the very presuppositions that Derridean thought derides. Thus, while in an ecumenical spirit Christian critics may seek to forge an eclectic critical theory, a biblically informed hermeneu- tics and the theory and practice of deconstruction would seem to share little common ground. We confess that our own journey into academic culture and into literary criticism (and its bastard son, critical theory) has left us with a pervasive sense of the vanity, even pretentiousness, with which this community sometimes practices its profession. This obviously affects the questions and issues we have chosen to underscore here. Thus, the evangelical Church's traditional, sincere, and unabashed mistrust of the world and its wisdom is a satisfying rebuke when we come too close to exchanging our biblical epistemology for one more palatable to Critical Inquiry subscribers. In this we often find our brethren's skepticism and</page><page sequence="13">Wise as Serpents, Harmless as Doves 315 aversion to theory a helpful antidote to the kind of pompo sity of which we and our colleagues are only too capable. Within this milieu we are challenged to consider again and again what it means to be in but not of the world. Our Lord sends us out as sheep among wolves and counsels us to be wise as serpents and harmless as doves . What is the ultimate import of his commission for Christian critics? We take him to mean something like what follows. In our attempts to live and proclaim our faith, we must not be naive, either about what our commitment entails or how we will be received by those outside the kingdom. In wisdom we must understand the way of the world without being seduced by it. The weapons of the world, even those of the enemy, maybe used against wickedness but only at great peril to our own identity as image-bearers of the Father. In care we must understand our task: quietly, patiently, to mediate the presence and the authority of our Lord in every life situation - even in the rarefied air of academia. Neither smugness nor false humility is in order. Wemust engage fairly in an effort to understand what is alien to us, not to subsume or appropriate it but to encounter and empathize with those who do not understand or share our faith. Thereby we increase the chances of discovering ways to enter this community and proclaim the gospel. To be wise as serpents, harmless as doves, we must not pretend to know more than we do, but we dare not pretend to know less.
