A critical review of the traditional histories and the results of recent archaeological research in Igbomina reveal that these changes were not restricted to the central Yoruba areas but also manifested in the Yoruba periphery. Ila has been described as a major regional polity in northern Yoruba , whose early development may have followed a similar trajectory as the Old Oyo state . This paper is a report of our recent archaeological survey, excavation, and finds at Ila-Iyara, the major Ila political center occupied between the 14th and 1 7th centuries. Ila-Iyara exhibits evidence of large elite center, fortifications, sacred sites, iron working, and ceramic types similar to those found at Oyo, Ife, and Benin. The archaeological work in Ila-Iyara also provides further insight into the processes of socio- political development, the dynamics of changes, and the different web of interactions on the Yoruba northern frontier prior to the 18th century. Résumé La période entre le 15ème et le 17ème siècle AD. était une pé- riode de changements socio-politiques dans tout le pays de Yoruba. Une révision critique des histoires traditionelles et des résultats de la recherche archéologique récente dans Igbomina révèle que ces changements n ' étaient pas limités au centre des régions Yoruba mais qu ' ils sont aussi évidents dans la périphérie de Yoruba. Ila est décrit comme un centre politique majeur au nord de Yoruba, dont le début de déve- loppement pourrait avoir suivi une trajectoire similaire à celle de l'État d'Ancien Oyo. Cet article est un rapport sur notre étude archéologique récente, de fouille, et des décou- vertes dans Ila-Iyara ; celui-ci est un site d'habitation majeur d'Ila qui a été occupé entre le 14ème et le 1 7ème siècle. Ila-Iyara révèle un centre d'élite large, des fortifications, des sites sacrés et métallurgique, et des types de céramique similaire à ceux trouvés dans Oyo, à Ife, et au Benin. Le travail ar- chéologique dans lia fournit davantage un aperçu fascinant sur le procédé du développement socio-politique, les dyna- miques de changements, et les différents réseaux d'interac- tions dans la zone du nord de Yoruba antérieurement au 18ème siècle.

Usmán, J. Aleru &amp; R. Alabi Introduction The early interest to document prehistoric so- cieties in southwestern Nigeria has engendered focus on large polities such as Ife, Benin, Old Oyo, and Owo (Willet 1960a, 1960b; Connah 1967; Garlake 1974; Connah 1975; Eluyemi 1975; Garlake 1977; Soper &amp; Darling 1980; Agbaje-Williams 1983, 1986a, 1986b). The urge to conduct archaeological investigations at these centers was often due to their presumed historical im- portance as indicated by the oral traditions, the reports of early Arab and European visitors, or by the presence of artworks or monumental structures. Our knowledge is therefore very much constrained by a general preoc- cupation with the development of the large political centers. Less understood are the hinterland societies and how they are connected to the large centers. Little research has been conducted in northern Yorubaland, either because of its distant location to central Yoruba groups, or its small-scale sociopolitical structure. Also, the area has long been regarded as unaffected by the regional Yoruba socio-political development that gave rise to large state polities like Old Oyo in the 15th cen- tury. Recently, archaeological researches in southwest- ern Nigeria have experienced changes in concept and approach with a shift from focus on individual state capital centers to examination of states and their pe- ripheries (e.g., Ogundiran 2000; Usman 2000, 2001). This paper is based on the results obtained from our fieldwork in Nigeria at Ila-Iyara, the center of Ila polity from the 15th to 17th century. The data from survey and excavations offers some insights into the processes of sociopolitical formation, the dynamics of changes, and the different web of interactions. The Ila socio-political development corresponds to the rise of Oyo and the establishment of authority in Igbomina in the 16th century. However, the Ila fledgling polity appears to have suffered from Oyo' s political power and influence in Igbomina and may have contributed to Ila's early exit by the 17th century. The paper relies on a combination of oral and documentary histories, and archaeological sources. Setting and Historical Context The northern Yorubaland is situated in the wood- land savanna belt of Nigeria, characterized by tall grasses, scattered trees, and shrubs. It is a zone of great topographic and ecological diversity, with eleva- tions ranging from 1000 to 3000 ft above sea level, with bare rock surfaces and boulder- strewn hills. This area has residual hills bordered by well-developed pedi- ments, and includes ridge and exfoliation domes (Buchanan &amp; Pugh 1958). The northern Yoruba groups include the Igbomina, Ibolo, and llorín, all in present day Kwara state and part of Osun state. Other groups are the Okun- Yoruba or northeast Yoruba, comprising the Owe or Kabba, Ijumu, Bunu, Iyagba, and the Oworo. They are located on the right bank of the Niger above and below the confluence, and are presently in Kogi state. Some other Yoruba culture groups, such as the Ekiti, and non- Yoruba groups like Bariba, Nupe, Igala, Ebira, and the Kakanda, share borders with the north- ern Yoruba groups (Fig. 1). The Igbomina area where research was conducted has also been called north central Yorubaland. The to- pography in the northeast Igbomina is more rugged and hilly than the western Igbomina. The hills, known as the Ire Range, divide the northeastern from the west- ern Igbomina. Igbomina has been described as a north- ern province of Old Oyo (Johnson 1921 ; Law 1977), based on the geopolitical division of the territory under the Old Oyo administration. The Osin River east of Ajasepo may have formed the Old Oyo boundary (Law 1977; Usman 2001). Old Oyo controlled or influenced several Igbomina towns east and west of the Osin River (Biscoe 1912; Burnett 1912a, 1912b; Law 1977). The incorpora- tion of Igbomina by Old Oyo and the creation of fron- tier communities were for strategic purposes, be they eco- nomic or political. Also, the military importance of the Igbomina to the Old Oyo was vital, particularly their stra- tegic position between Old Oyo and an enemy, the Nupe. Ila defines a group of Yoruba people, the polity, as well as the settlements (e.g., Ila-Orangun, Oke-Ila) in which the people are living. In the precolonial period, IIa was one of the several 4 mini- states' or 'chief doms' that developed in the Yoruba northern frontier. The Ila people are part of a distinct dialect Yoruba sub-group known as Igbona. The modern principal town of Ila people, Ila-Orangun, lies about 65 km northeast of He- lfe and 90 km southeast of florin on the southern edge of the savanna. While much of Igbomina settlements are presently located in Kwara State, Ila-Orangun, Ora and other settlements associated with Ila are in Osun State. It can also be said that in the pre-colonial period IIa was situated at the edge of the forest and the other Igbomina polities (e.g., Share, Ipo, Oke-Ode, Ilere, Esisa, Irese, Iyangba, Oro, and Isin) occupied the savanna stretch below the bend of the Niger River from latitude 4° and 8° East and longitude 8° and 9° North (Falola 1999: 239) (Fig. 2). Today, more than 80 % of Ila people are farmers who plant a wide range of subsistence and 140 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 3 (1), 2005</page><page sequence="3">Sociopolitical Formation on the Yoruba Northern Frontier: A Report of Recent Work at Ila-Iyara, North Central Nigeria Fig. 1.

Usmán, J . Aleru &amp; R. Alabi cash crops, such as yam, cassava, pepper, maize, plan- tain, cocoa, kolanut, pineapples, avocado pears, or- ange, guava, among others. In addition, the people are skilful palm- wine tappers - a profession for which they are known nationwide, hence the Yoruba saying "emu l'ogun Ila" (palm- wine is the medicine of Ila, i.e., palm- wine is the cure for illness at Ila). While the men tap palm-wine, the women sell it in bars located in towns. Also, the Ila people engage in local arts and craft industries such as basketry, pottery, soap making, cloth- weaving, and wood carving. A famous Yoruba wood carver, Fakeye, hails from Ila-Orangun. The process of socio-political formation of Ila is rooted in mythical ideology. Ideologies are beliefs cre- ated and manipulated by certain social groups, most notably the ruling elites of chiefdoms and states, to establish and maintain the legitimacy of their position in communities. Ideologies involve public performances that recount religious theology and social narratives (Johnson &amp; Earle 2000: 259). The elites assert special status with respect to the gods and the universe, and that makes the elites essential in the ritual practice on which the continuity and fertility of the community depend (Johnson &amp; Earle 2000). Various Yoruba traditions iden- tify Ile-Ife or Ife as the place of creation, and legends associated the ancient city with Oduduwa, the first Oba and founder of the Yoruba people. Among the Yoruba, the descendants of the sons of Oduduwa take prec- edence over other lineages, and reckoning descent from Oduduwa was necessary to validate a ruler's claim to the right to wear an 'ade', or beaded crown (Johnson 1921: 8). Scholars who relied on oral and written tradition of Ile-Ife origin and dynastic theory believed that princes who were children of Oduduwa of Ile-Ife were pioneers of state formation and cultural innovation in Yorubaland. Johnson (1921) lists lia as one of the kingdoms established by Ile-Ife princes. Others are: the Olowu of Owu, the Alaketu of Ketu, the founder of Benin people, Onisabe of Sabe, Olupopo of Popo, and Oranyan of Old Oyo (Johnson 1921 : 7-8). This clas- sification "has inspired the descriptions of the Yoruba as the Omo Oodua (offspring, or those under the um- brella, of Oduduwa)" (Obayemi 1976: 209). Neverthe- less, the theory of Ile-Ife princes as pioneers of state formation in southwestern Nigeria has run counter to some oral data, linguistic and archaeological evidence which suggest that numerous "centers of population" in the form of villages, small states, and even king- doms were in existence before the migration of so-called Ife princes (Obayemi 1976; Pemberton &amp; Afolayan 1996: 11). For example, the existence of other "fairly well-defined mini-states, [such as] Iwo, Owu, Oba... in the Igbomina area" before and during the Ila period has been documented (Obayemi 1997: 24-37). The oral tradition in Ila-Orangun dates the origins of the town to the 13th century and claims a link with Oduduwa and Ile-Ife as the source of its authority as a crowned town. Some accounts refer to Ifagbamila (Ajagunla), the founder, as the son of Oduduwa who left Ile-Ife with his mother, Queen Adetinrin about the 12th century (Adetoyi 1974: 9; Pemberton &amp; Afolayan 1996: 17). Ila has been referred to over the years as a kingdom and its ruler, the Orangun-Ila, as the leader of the Igbomina (George 1895: 25; Johnson 1921: 78; Atanda 1973: 8). Writing in September 1917, the British Resident of llorín Province, K.V. Elphinstone, observed: "The Orangun is the senior chief of all Igbonas. When it comes to looking into his position it appears that he never has been overlord of any of the Igbonas on this side of the boundary [the llorín Province] ... his power is obtained from his juju or title or both" (Pemberton &amp; Afolayan 1996: 1 1). At the time Elphinstone made this comment, he was correct in noting that the crowned town of Ila-Orangun had little or no influence on the northern Igbomina peoples. By the early 18th century the imperial ambitions of the Alaafin of Oyo had begun to compromise whatever power the Ila had among the Igbomina (Afolayan 1998). Ila-Iyara, the investigated archaeological site in Ila, is located at approximately 7°56'N and 4°57'E in the Northeastern part of Osun State. It is 7.5 km southeast of Ila-Orangun town and 4 km west of Oke-Ila. Nearby modern villages include Obasinkin, Aiyegunle, Ajebandele, Kajola, Edemosi and Ajaba among others. In this century Ila-Iyara has been successively and increasingly farmed. The soils permitted cultivation of cash crops such as cocoa, kolanut, orange, and guava that were sold far and wide. Several farm settlements were in the area and the closest to the site, Oko-Ejemu, is located at the eastern part of Ila-Iyara. The soil is generally moist and deep in some areas where bedrock has not been exposed. In areas where the vegetation has been disrupted, there are laterite and some iron- stone concretions at the foot slopes that may have been utilized in iron working (Akpobasa 1994). A net- work of rivers and streams generally crisscrosses the area. Among these are Isa, Oyi, and Alanwo. Isolated plains are concentrated in the southeastern part of Ila- Iyara and they stretch northeastward. This is halted by the sudden rise or escarpment which characterizes the headwater of the Alanwo River. At the peak of the dry season the river ceases flowing, with water con- 142 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 3 (1), 2005</page><page sequence="5">Sociopolitical Formation on the Yoruba Northern Frontier: A Report of Recent Work at Ila-Iyara, North Central Nigeria Fig. 3. Ila-Iyara site, habitation features, and areas of excavation (modified after Akpobasa 1994). centrated only in some isolated pools along its bed. With time most of these pools dry up except Ibu-Ogun at the base of the Alan wo Fall. It may be noted that no European observer in the pre-colonial period ever grasped the nature of Ila set- tlements at their inception. The European travelers ar- rived too late in the area and only captured the horrific devastations of wars following the fall of Old Oyo. William H. Clarke, a missionary of the Southern Baptist Convention, the first European to reach Ila-Orangun in 1858 described what he saw: "If there is a being that deserves our pity and sympathy it is the unfortunate one whom the ravages of time have reduced from opu- lence and power to a state of poverty and penury. Such seemed to be the condition of the monarch of Igbomina. Whatever the country and capital may have been in its palmy days, there are marks sufficiently evident to prove that those days are no more that the power of royalty is lost and the kingdom exists only in name" (Clarke 1972: 153-154). Fieldwork Like the rest of Igbomina polities, Ila contains a rich body of oral-ethnohistorical data that give valu- able information about sociopolitical development in secondary polities. Interviews were conducted and fo- cused on town history, including accounts of migra- tion and warfare. Oral tradition came from elders and lineage chiefs of Ila-Orangun, and particularly from chief D. A. Oyewole, the head of Ejemu lineage and king- maker of Ila-Orangun since 1945. Also consulted was Pemberton &amp; Afolayan's (1996) book "Yoruba sacred kingship: a power like that of the gods" which con- tains relevant oral tradition. In addition, two publica- tions (Babatunde 1973 and Adetoyi 1974) are devoted entirely to oral tradition of Ila. Previous to our work at Ila-Iyara, Akpobasa (1994) had undertaken a limited survey of the site, which documented some of its sur- face cultural and natural features. The result from this survey is complimented by our recent work that of- fered a more amplified understanding of the sub-sur- face cultural materials and natural features of the site. Site Characteristics Economic plants at Ila-Iyara such as cocoa, or- ange, banana, guava, cocoyam, kolanut, and other veg- etation make visibility difficult and a barrier to a sys- tematic, intensive pedestrian transect survey. As a re- sult, the survey strategy employed was mostly field walking. The previous survey carried out by Akpobasa (1994) was also helpful in the location of important fea- tures at the site, while local guides suggested addi- tional areas of interest. The most conspicuous features Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 3 (1), 2005 143</page><page sequence="6">A. Usmán, J. Aleru &amp; R. Alabi Fig. 4. Crushing/grinding bedrock hollows. at the site are rampart walls and ditches that probably enclosed the site. Ramparts and ditches are artificial fortifications built to ward off external aggressions or as territorial and/or political demarcation. The name 'Iyara' is synonymous with the conspicuous walling system of the site. Iyàrà or Yàrà in Yoruba means trench or ditch behind the walls of a town. The term Iyara may have been added much later to the actual name of the site, Ila, probably to distinguish it from other Ila communities without enclosure. Ila's oral tradition reports that the ruler Amota de- fended the town against the attacks of the Olowu of Owu, a once powerful Yoruba kingdom to whom Oyo paid tribute in its early history (Pemberton &amp; Afolayan 1996: 38), by erecting a wall around the settlement. Amota requested his people to supply large quantity of "beans" with which to construct an eredo , a massive dirt wall fronted by a deep pit, around Ila (Pemberton &amp; Afolayan 1996: 41). 'Beans' as described here may have been tributes, or levies in the form of food, on the citizens for the labors employed in the construction, a manifestation of royal power. A small cross-section of the wall along Ila-Aiyegunle road investigated by Akpobasa (1994) showed the wall height to be about 10.7 m, and the width and depth of the trench as 5.3 m and 2.5 m respectively. Other important site characteristics are midden mounds, crushing hollows, streams, and sacred places. No standing houses were found at Ila-Iyara. The com- mon habitation remains are mounds and middens, the distribution of which indicates different points of hu- man occupation within the fortified area. Also, habita- tion appears concentrated in specific spots and other areas used as resource range. The proximity of the oc- cupation mounds to the Alanwo River explains its sig- nificance as the major source of water for the inhabit- ants. 'Ibu Ogun' (Ogun pool) of the Alanwo River at Ila-Iyara, and Igbo-Ogun (sacred forest of Ogun) in the southeastern part of the site provided indirect evi- dence of ancient iron working and the importance of Ogun cult among the Ila people. Iron working at Ila- Iyara may also be connected with the smelting furnace at Aiyegunle, a nearby settlement (Akpobasa 1994). Crushing or grinding hollows were found in the bedrock of the Alanwo River. Each of the roughly circular hollows has an average diameter of 8 cm and depth of between 5 and 7 cm. Bedrock hollows which are common in West Africa were multifunctional. For example, they have been interpreted as sites of recrea- tion, especially Ayo, a popular game in Yorubaland (Akpobasa 1994; Aleru 1998). Also, Clapperton ob- served on his visit to northern Yorubaland in the nine- teenth century that, "the top of the hill was covered with women grinding corn. They make round holes in the face of the rock in which they crush the grain" (Clapperton 1829: 21). In addition, shells of the kernel of the oil palm, after being rounded and smoothed, are bored and made into beads (Fadipe 1970: 24). Among the people of Geji, near Bauchi, in Northern Nigeria, the women prepare their clay for potting by grinding it to a fine powder with a quartz rubbing stone on suit- able flat rock surfaces (Sassoon 1962: 145). Owing to the grains of quartz sand in the clay, this activity wears deep grooves in the rock much more quickly than when corn is being ground (Sassoon 1962). 144 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 3 (1), 2005</page><page sequence="7">Sociopolitical Formation on the Yoruba Northern Frontier: A Report of Recent Work at Ila-Iyara, North Central Nigeria Fig. 5. Profiles of Ila-Iyara excavation. An alternative interpretation of rock hollows is in connection with iron working. On the Jos Plateau in Nigeria, the core (or bloom) from the iron smelting fur- nace is pounded thoroughly with a stone hammer in a rock depression to remove the impurities (charcoal, slag) before they are handed over to the blacksmith (Sassoon 1962). Recent ethno-archaeological study by Nicholas David at Sukur in northern Nigeria has described some bedrock hollows as 'fining complexes' connected with iron working, especially for processing of blooms (David 1998). The hollows may have been formed as the inte- rior surfaces were roughened by the repeated impact of stone hammers transmitted through irregular frag- ments of bloomery iron (Fig. 4). In Igbomina bedrock hollows have been found in the vicinities of ironworking or at settlements with tradition of iron working (Aleru 1998; Usman 2001). Beside other functions, the bed- rock hollows at Ila-Iyara may be connected to past iron working activities, especially iron smelting. Excavation and Finds Excavation enhances the chances of recovery of artifacts and ensures a better understanding of their contexts. A small test unit of 2 x 1 m was excavated within the midden mound located northeast of Igbo- Ogun in a gridded area measuring 10 m x 10 m. The unit was hand excavated by arbitrary 10 cm levels to a depth of 1 .6 m. This unit-level method also served as a means of control for the removal of artifacts, their analysis, and subsequent interpretation. A large amount of ceramic was found throughout levels 1 through 6. The largest proportion of ceramic came from level 6. However, this level was a bit off the regular 10 cm (about 1 3 cm), and may contribute to the sharp increase in the material. Latentes and granites stones were common in level 3 (20-30 cm). These were close to the surface and farmers clearing the land may have thrown them there recently (Fig. 5). The non-ceramic artifacts from the excavation are few, and include animal bones, unmodified lithics, shells, quartz beads, iron slag, iron pieces, tuyere (clay pipe), cowries, fishing weight, and palm kernels (Tab. 1 ). Palm kernels mostly concentrated in the upper level repre- sent recent deposition. There were also significant amount of burnt kernel and iron pieces in the middle excavated levels. The iron pieces include a knife, needles, and a metal point (arrow). A fishing weight made of lithic ma- terial, with a hole bored through it, was found (Fig. 6). A similar object was recovered in excavation performed by Usman at Ahun in northeastern Igbomina during the 2003 field season. Even though the excavated dirt was carefully sieved using fine-mesh screens, no macroscopic botanical remains were found in the Ila-Iyara excava- tion. Soil samples were collected for each stratum for Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 3 (1), 2005 145</page><page sequence="8">A. Usmán, J. Aleru &amp; R.

Poor preservation of perishable materi- als also has precluded the recovery of such materials. A charcoal sample obtained from the lower level 1 5 of the Ila-Iyara excavation ( 1 40- 150 cm) has provided a radiocarbon age of 375 ± 40 BP with 2-sigma 95.4 % probability, calibrated AD 1442-1531 (A 13054). Although multiple dates might provide more confidence in the chronology of the site, this single date obtained is close to the date suggested in the oral tradition. The tradi- tions of Ila indicate that the original migrants left Ile-Ife around the 13 th century and settled at some other places where the founder of Ila, Ifagbamila (Ajagunla), was born before arriving at Ila-Iyara in Igbomina. If this is correct, then the date of Ajagunla group's arrival at Ila- Iyara is not expected to be earlier than the 14th century. Ceramic Analysis The majority of the artifacts from the excavation is pottery. The use of pottery is of great interest to ar- chaeologists concerned with the nature of interaction between different cultural groups, including the study of diffusion and exchange systems (Deetz 1965; Whallon 1968; Hill 1970; Engelbrecht 1974). The ceramic stylistic attributes, defined here as vessel and decoration motifs, are products of social cognition, his- torical relationships, and culture-specific ceramic func- 146 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 3 (1), 2005</page><page sequence="9">Sociopolitical Formation on the Yoruba Northern Frontier: A Report of Recent Work at Ila-Iyara, North Central Nigeria Levels 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 TOTAL Decoration Types Twisted string 257 175 290 293 284 459 154 165 108 161 234 262 83 73 117 17 3132 Twisted 30 19 70 48 27 110 20 14 8 26 21 25 12 8 19 4 461 strin^groove Groove 34 31 57 41 31 69 12 11 14 23 28 40 13 8 20 1 433 Burnished 43-3 11 8142964-254 66 Painted* 34 14 5232213162171 57 Carved 421559117-17422 - 51 roulette Incision 5255921121 - 3-1 - - 37 Punetaùon** 3 - 2 - - 12 - 2 - 1 - 4 - 3 3 1 31 Fluted - - 9 3 12 Scallops 2--3-2--1 - --1 9 Rocked 1-1-21----1---1- 7 combing Groove/ -11 __2---2----l 7 Punctation Total 341 237 452 403 371 678 191 202 142 226 293 351 114 98 176 28 4303 Tab. 2.

The use of decorative motifs as type or form deter- minants has been suggested (Aleru 2000). As recog- nized from an ethnographic study carried out by Usman in April 2003 at Omupo in Kwara State, potters do tend to apply particular types of decoration to certain vessel types; for example, bowls are usually burnished, in- cised, and grooved, while jars are often not. Also, decorative motifs sometimes represent a potter's trade mark, as some potters tend to favor particular decoration. For instance, among the Gwari women potters in Niger State of Nigeria the carved wooden roulette is very popu- lar. In fact each woman carves her own wood that dis- tinguishes her wares from those of other potters and serves as her stamp (Aleru 2000). Apart from this, cer- tain decorative motifs (e.g., twisted cord, maize cob and carved wooden roulette) may be applied on certain ves- sels to enhance accident-free handling. Decorative motif could also add to the aesthetic values of the vessels. Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 3 (1), 2005 147</page><page sequence="10">A. Usmán, J. Aleru &amp; R.

Description of Ceramic Vessel Types from Ila-Iyara (* = Connah 1975; ** = Garlake 1974, 1977). 148 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 3 (1), 2005</page><page sequence="11">Sociopolitical Formation on the Yoruba Northern Frontier: A Report of Recent Work at Ila-Iyara, North Central Nigeria Fig. 8. Ceramic vessel forms from Ila-Iyara. Most of the diagnostic ceramics from Ila-Iyara con- sist of decorated and plain body sherds and rims, lamps, and lids, including miniature pot lids similar to those found at Daima in northern Nigeria (Connah 1981: 152). Out of a total of 6891 potsherds recovered from the excavation at Ila-Iyara, 4254 are decorated. Twisted string roulette impression was found in all the excavation levels and constitutes about 73.6 % of the decorative motifs. This is followed by composite or multiple designs types, such as twisted string roulette/groove (10.8 %). Others are groove (10.1 %), painted pottery (red, white, exterior, or inte- rior: 3 %), carved wood roulette ( 1 .2 %), incisions (0.8 %), and punctation (dot, triangle, or circle-stylus: 0.7 %). Scallops, rocked combing (or in combination with groove or punctation), fluted, encrustated, and other composite designs are also found (Tab. 2 and Fig. 7). In classifying rimsherds into vessel types, we used rim morphology (shape or form of the rim). Rimsherds were classified as either in-turned, out-turned, everted, inverted, vertical, externally thickened or internally thickened rim. On the basis of these characteristics it was possible to reconstruct entire pot forms and deter- mine whether each rim was from ajar or bowl (Tab. 3 and Fig. 8). Jars tend to have greater depth than width, while bowls tend to have greater width than depth. The func- tional and capacity references attached to each of the types have been established based on similar usage and on the basis of ethnographic surveys carried out in other parts of Yorubaland (e.g., Aleru 1988; Fatunsin 1992). The procedures resulted in the definition of a number of jars and bowls classes. In the jar category are: (1) ikoko (storage, industrial use); (2) Amu (e.g., water pot); and (3) ápe (small cooking pots). There are clear typological differences among these categories but the same cannot be said with regard to variation within each of the groups. In the bowl category, there are agbada type (used for frying, cooking, serving, eat- ing, lighting, etc.), isaasun type (used specifically for cooking stew or soup), and awo-ifa or ritual bowls type. A total of 613 rim sherds were analyzed to obtain information about different types of vessels forms at Ila-Iyara and insights into the relative functions of these e.g., storage, preparation, and consumption of food either in domestic or ritual contexts. Based on the Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 3 (1), 2005 149</page><page sequence="12">A. Usmán, J. Aleru &amp; R. Alabi Igbomina ceramic type classification (Usman 1998), the Jar category types B 1 , B2, M, P, Q, R, and T were repre- sented in the Ila-Iyara pottery assemblage. The most dominant is B 1 jar (water pot), representing about 57 % of the vessel jars, followed by Q jar (31 %)š Jars gener- ally constitute about 38 % of the vessel forms. Bowls showed large variability within the category with no major dominant type as in jars. For example, AB6 type has the highest occurrence with 14.8 %, followed closely by AB8 bowl with 12.1 %. Generally, Ila-Iyara showed higher frequency of bowls than jars. Regional Ceramic Comparison and Interactions The ceramic attributes of Ife established during the 10th and 11th centuries at Ita Yemoo, for example, continued till the 16th century in Woye Asiri and Obalara sites, and 17th- 18th centuries in Lafogido and Odo Ogbe sites (Eyo 1974b; Garlake 1974, 1977). Eyo (1974a) has also demonstrated that the ceramic styles of Ife have a broad regional distribution. He compares the pottery decoration attributes from Benin, Igbo'laja site in Owo, Odo Ogbe and Lafogido sites in Ife, and concludes that the same surface patterns and decoration motifs were employed by the inhabitants of these areas between the 11th and 18th centuries (Eyo 1974a: 410). Ceramic stylistic attributes of Ife included embossed geometric and anthropomorphic motifs, reliefs of cordon and geo- metric motifs, hyphenated cross-hatched incisions, cir- cular stylus impressions, geometric stamps, rusticated and encrustated surface, and the use of red paint on ceramic exteriors (Willet 1967; Garlake 1974, 1977). The first major analysis of Old Oyo ceramic di- vided it into two groups, Diogun and Mejiro, based on the excavations at Old Oyo, northwest of llorín (Willet 1960a). Further work had established that the Diogun type is probably earlier, dating to AD 1100 ± 110 (Okpoko 1987:258). The Diogun ceramic is character- ized by impressed triangles and zigzags in a variety of treatments, broom or brush marking incisions, rocked comb impressions, impressed arcs (scallops), knotted and frond roulettes. The later Mejiro ceramic type (AD 1 300 ± 80) is characterized by straight line or curvilin- ear impressed round dots, snail shell (finger nail) stamps, carved wood and maize cob roulettes. Subse- quent work by Agb aje- Williams (1983) suggests that several of the decorative motifs used to distinguish between Diogun and Mejiro pottery are actually con- temporaneous. Carved- wood and maize-cob roulette designs belong to the upper levels, and snail shell stamps are earlier. Both Diogun and Mejiro wares ex- hibit twisted cord/string roulette, brushmarking, and snail shell impressions (Agbaje-Williams 1983; Ajekigbe 1998). The ceramic seriation of Old Oyo sug- gests that the city was occupied from AD 1000 or ear- lier up to about 1837 and that the two main phases of occupation, Diogun and Mejiro, may not have been separated by a period of abandonment. Based on the surface treatments of the ceramic vessel forms, the sherds we found at Ila-Iyara shared some of the Yoruba pottery types found at Ife, Oyo, Benin, and some Igbomina areas (e.g., Ipo, Isin). Com- mon decorative types at Ila-Iyara include twisted string roulette, incision, groove, painted pottery, scallops, carved wooden roulette, rocked combing, and punctations (in- cluding circle stylus). Broom or brush incisions are un- common while snail shell (or 'fingernail') decorated pottery has not been found in our Ila-Iyara excavation, though it has been reported in surface context ( Akpob as a 1994). These decorative types are common at Old Oyo, and have been reported in excavations conducted in western Igbomina (Aleru 2000; Usman 2001). Painted ceramic, recognized in Ife and Benin (e.g., Garlake 1974; Connah 1975), was present in fairly large quantity at Ila-Iyara; painted pottery is uncommon among other sites investigated in Igbomina (Usman 2001). The analy- sis of ceramic vessels from Ila-Iyara shows high frequency of bowls and more varied bowl types than jars. The jar types A, D, and L common to most sites in Igbomina (Usman 2001) are not represented at Ila-Iyara. Also some of the excavated vessels are similar in form to vessels from Benin (Connah 1975) and Ife (Garlake 1974), which include Jar types B 1 , M, Q, R; and bowl types AB 1 , AB3- 4, AB8-9, AB21-22; and CB3-6 (see Tab, 3). Bowl types CB3-CB6 are more common to Ila-Iyara than to any other Igbomina settlements. However, the high proportion of B 1 jar (water pot) in the jar vessel category at Ila-Iyara is similar to Gbagede in Ipo area where the ceramic as- semblage was also dominated by water jar (Usman 2001). Discussion and conclusion The Intermediate Period of Ife (ca 1400-1600 AD) was a period of socio-political changes throughout Yorubaland. This period witnessed large-scale mi- gration of people toward northern and eastern Yorubaland as a result of economic and political pres- sure, establishment of new settlements, overrunning of older communities, and warring with others in their need and desire for economic stability, political power, and territory (Smith 1969). According to oral traditions, Amota led his followers from Igbo Ajagunla (the site 150 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 3 (1), 2005</page><page sequence="13">Sociopolitical Formation on the Yoruba Northern Frontier: A Report of Recent Work at Ila-Iyara, North Central Nigeria where Ajagunla was born) to Ila-Iyara. These groups, like other immigrant groups during this period, prob- ably included members of specialized professions: blacksmiths, iron smelters, wood-carvers, leather work- ers, diviners, medicine men, and career warriors. From the 16th century and until the late 18th cen- tury, Old Oyo was unrivaled as successive Oyo rul- ers pressed their conquests and claims to the east in Igbomina, to the southeast beyond Ile-Ife, and to the southwest into the realms of Dahomey (Pemberton &amp; Afolayan 1996). The establishment of Old Oyo au- thority in the area following the defeat of Nupe fur- ther encouraged the influx of Yoruba immigrants from the south to northern Yoruba. Also, the growing pe- ripheral centers in the area may have attracted people because they offered more security and better so- cioeconomic prospects. This is what has been called socio-political "pull" factors (Usman 2003) associated with the rise and expansion of Old Oyo from the 16th century, the establishment of frontier polities in the north, and the colonization of the conquered territory by Yoruba immigrants from the south. The rise of Old Oyo brought further momentous transformations in the sociopolitical landscape of northern Yoruba in terms of large aggregated settlements with local elites in new alliance or relation with the Oyo polity (Elphinstone 1921; Obayemi 1976; Law 1977; Dada 1985). At Ila-Iyara, the arrival of new immigrants resulted in considerable political transformation in the form of 'centralized' polities with outlying subordinate villages and towns. The attempts at settlement must have been met with resistance from preexisting groups that they encountered. Such encounters may have been violent, or compromises may have been made that probably involved the subordination of preexisting groups to new centers of authority. The emerging polity of Ila- Iyara also faced the growing and competing polities on the frontier, such as Owu, Ijesha, and Benin kingdoms. Owu was among the earliest polity to develop a cav- alry army in the savanna (Pemberton &amp; Afolayan 1996). In addition, the growing importance of the Atlantic trade, and the increasing use of horses in warfare in the West African savanna may have forced many weaker and powerful groups to seek protection (McIntosh &amp; McIntosh 1988). The evolution of stratified and centrally organ- ized society has been described as a protection racket (Gilman 1991). Leaders provide protection from attack by social predators (including themselves) in return for tributary payoffs (Earle 1997). The construction of walls and ditches was a manifestation of the socio- political formation processes in Igbomina. It has been suggested that the need to defend one's group from powerful outside forces is in itself enough to encour- age political integration in order to resist annihilation (Johnson &amp; Earle 2000: 15). The walls and ditches testify unambiguously both to the central organization of a labor force and to the function of Ila-Iyara as an emerging regional political center. Ramparts and ditches are important features in the large states of Benin, Oyo, Ife, Koso, and Owu, and have been studied extensively (Connah 1967; Ozanne 1969; Mabogunje &amp; Omer-Cooper 197 1 ; Soper &amp; Darling 1980; Agbaje- Williams 1990). The inhabitants of Ipo in western Igbomina, like Ila people, built ramparts and ditches with estimated circumference of between 3 and 4 km (Usman 2001). Many of the Igbomina traditions sug- gest that amalgamation occurred under the pressure of external aggression. The Ila-Iyara and Ipo constructed enclosed walls and evolved towards more unified con- trol to counter aggressions on the frontier and protect local communities. The archaeological evidence from Ila-Iyara raises important issues about Ila's cultural identities and intersocietal interaction on the Yoruba frontier before the 17th century. On the basis of ceramic decoration and vessel forms, Ila shared some of the types identi- fied at Ife, Oyo, Benin, and Igbomina centers. The presence of Ife-Oyo ceramic types at Ila-Iyara was a consequence of the migration of people from Ife and Oyo areas from the 15th century, trade, or other form of social relations. However, the evidence of settle- ments in Igbomina with Oyo-Ife ceramic types as early as the 13th century (Aleru 1998; Usman 2001) indicates that some of the ceramic types had already been pro- duced in the region before the establishment of Old Oyo political authority. Some of these ceramic types, particularly snail shell (finger-nail) pottery, a popular decorative type of Old Oyo but also found at Ile-Ife, became very common in western Igbomina of Ipo from the 17th century, and at some sites it surpassed in number time-transgression decoration like twisted string roulette. At Ila-Iyara, snail shell decoration is absent, at least from excavation contexts. The absence may suggest two things: First, Ila-Iyara was already abandoned before the large-scale migration of Oyo- Yoruba into Igbomina in the 17th century. Second, it may indicate that Ila polity was outside the main Oyo sphere of influence during the 16th and 17th centuries. Ila's location at the edge or close to the forest means that access to forest goods and interactions Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 3 (1), 2005 151</page><page sequence="14">A. Usmán, J . Aleru &amp; R. Alabi with people of Ife and Benin areas was assured. In the savanna to the north, IIa also interacted with Ekiti, Ipo- Erese, and Esie groups most of whom are predominantly Oyo stock. Oral and documentary evidence suggest that traders from faraway Benin journeyed to northern Yorubaland and brought back goods such as llorín beads, locust beans (iru), and cloth produced in Igbomina (Boahen 1986). Also, oral tradition collected from Ila-Orangun and neighboring Ijaba village indi- cates that Ila people relied on vessels traded from other places such as Iresi, Isan, Koro in Ekiti Yoruba, and Ajasepo in Ipo area of Igbomina. Ila' s neighboring towns of Isan, Ara, and Obo made the finest pots and pottery goods in Ekiti (Akintoye 197 1 :24). The sociopolitical efflorescence at Ila-Iyara may have been disrupted by the imperial ambition of Old Oyo and its increasing influence in Igbomina (Afolayan 1998: 79). Although the exact way in which this disruption occurred is less clear, by the 17th cen- tury the Oyo authority in the area had boosted the prestige of Olupo (a local chiefly elite in western Igbomina) by using it as the superintendent of Oyo interests in northern Igbomina (May 1860; Biscoe 1916; Elphinstone 1921; Hermon-Hodge 1929; Temple 1965; Talbot 1969; Akintoye 1971: 20-21; Law 1977). As early as the 17th century, the Ijesa peoples to the south and Benin warriors to the southeast had engaged in hos- tilities with a number of Igbomina communities. By the mid- 17th century Ila-Iyara had been abandoned due to these and other internal political crisis, and the popu- lation moved to IIa Magbon (later known as Ila-Orangun), where the process of socio-political consolidation con- tinued (Pemberton &amp; Afolayan 1996). However, the newly established settlement of IIa Magbon and other large Igbomina centers such as Gbagede soon suffered from Nupe, Fulani, and Ibadan onslaughts that contin- ued into the 19th century, and further denied the groups any sustained sociopolitical establishments. Generally, the Ila-Ipo-Erese-Oro-Esie areas of Igbo- mina may represent a culture area sharing the same cultural attributes, which include the widespread pot- sherd pavements, pottery types, among others. Ila shar- ing of material cultural attributes with western Igbo- mina, which were heavily influenced by Old Oyo, may have signaled Ila's conscious lessening of its own in- fluence in the region as Old Oyo gradually became a powerful force. Ila's socio-political formation was not influenced by the rise of Old Oyo, but was part of a consequence of the regional socio-political changes in Yorubaland which occurred from the 15th century and gave rise to Old Oyo. Although Ila-Iyara exhibits some similarities in material culture with settlements in west- ern Igbomina, Ila-Iyara may represent the center of a regional polity, Ila, that include settlements mostly lo- cated to the forest in the south than to the savanna in the north. The exact political influence of Ila in northern Yoruba before the 17th century is still unclear. More stud- ies of the Da polity and neighboring settlements is needed in which the nature and evolution of this ancient social formation is traced and interpreted in its own terms.
