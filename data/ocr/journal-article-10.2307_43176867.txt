Five-year-old being ing his prepared. hated James tuna On was sandwich seeing watch- Five-year-old ing his hated tuna sandwich being prepared. On seeing dark flecks in the normally white tuna, he asked his mother what they were. "Shark!" she informed him. "Wow!" he said, and every bite of the formerly loathsome sandwich went down quickly. The next day he even brought the neighborhood kids over to eat shark sandwiches. For children of all ages, sharks hold an intrinsic fascination: They are dark, threatening, mysterious, fast, sleek, and dangerous. Teach- ers can capture this inherent inter- est in sharks and use it as a theme for an interdisciplinary unit that integrates science, mathematics, language arts, the arts, and social studies. The interdisciplinary unit that follows meets many goals. It dispels misconceptions and raises students' awareness of sharks, it helps stu- dents make connections between the various academic disciplines, it uses skills traditionally delegated to one discipline to solve prob- lems from many areas, and it builds process skills in and across subject domains. Management The activities for this unit are flexible and can be used in a vari- ety of situations depending on the organization of the classroom and the school. A team of five teach- ers, one from each subject domain included, can teach the unit over a two- or three-week period with each teacher making some or all of the activities from his or her do- main the focus of classroom activi- ties. As another option, a team of two or three teachers could inte- grate activities from all domains. Both of the these options can be used with either a block schedule or a more traditional schedule. The activities are intended to mix group exploration and problem solving with whole-class and indi- vidual activities, so that students are involved in a variety of experi- ences. Teachers can adapt the unit to the needs of their class by choosing which activities to use, how many will be required for each student, and whether the activities should be conducted individually or in groups. Some activities may be required for all students - such as language arts #4 and #5, science #5, and mathematics #1. Some activities can be presented in a menu format in which students are required to complete a specified number of activities from a list of selections. Some activities, such as mathematics #3 and #5, require students to individually find infor- mation and then compile the infor- mation as a class. Culminating activity Making a documentary videotape is a great way to tie together all that students have learned about sharks throughout the unit. The activity, language arts #5, reflects the goals of the unit by allowing students to share their new knowledge and graphically illustrate the connec- tions they have made between different subject domains. The finished videotape could be played at a PTA meeting, during a class assembly, or for other grades and classes. Charlene M. Czemiak is an assistant professor of elementary and middle school science education at the University of Toledo in Toledo, Ohio, and Jacqueline McDonald is an assistant professor of mathematics education at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia. - -I OCTOB E R 1 9 9 3</page><page sequence="3">Assessment The options for grading during the unit are numerous. The cooperating group of teachers should decide in advance whether to assign each student a cumulative unit grade, a grade for each content area, or grades for specific assignments. Some activities, such as mathematics #2, science #1, and social stud- ies #4, could be individually graded; cooperative learning activities such as science #5 and social studies #3 could receive a group grade; and activities used for large-group demonstrations and discussions, such as science #3, may not necessarily be suited to grading. Many of the activities provide authentic evaluation of students' abilities and are appropriate for portfolio assessment. Teachers should explore different options for assessing the unit; there is no specific right way. Shark studies with bite Science 1 . Select a favorite shark such as the great white and study its food chain. Write a report showing the different levels in the food chain and what animals or plants are eaten at each point. Illustrate your report. Be sure to go beyond the shark and look at those animals that are its predators. 2. Different species of sharks have different teeth (crushing, cutting, gouging, filter-feeding, or no teeth). The types of teeth are related to the specific shark's diet. Select a type of teeth and make a chart showing all the sharks with that type. What is common in their diet? Draw pictures or make a card game to match the type of diet with the shape and type of tooth. 3. Bring in a human tooth (if a younger sibling has recently lost a tooth) and a shark tooth (available from coastal souvenir shops, specialty catalogs, and nature stores), or make model teeth using plaster of Paris. Embed the shark tooth or model in a clay jaw, representing the cartilaginous skeletal structure of sharks, and the human tooth in a plaster of Paris jaw, representing bone. If a human tooth is not available, use another shark's tooth. Form an explanation for why a shark will grow and lose so many teeth during its lifetime. Explain why humans do not need to grow so many teeth in their lifetimes. 4. Make a classification key for sorting sharks into their orders. For example, the first junction would ask, "Does it have an anal fin?" Many examples of shark dichotomies can be found in reference books. Find a shark dichotomy and illustrate it with your own diagrams and pictures. Make Mathematics 1 . Make a table and collect the following information on 15-20 sharks: name, family, order, length, circumference at the widest point, weight, and top swimming speed. The ratio of length to circumfer- ence is called the "fineness" ratio. List the sharks in order by their fineness ratios. Do you see any pattern in the sharks' top swimming speeds? Can you describe this relationship? Explore the fineness ratios of other marine life. How do they compare to that of sharks? 2. Use information about sharks to review your math textbook. Look at the table of contents and write one shark story problem for each chapter you have studied in your textbook. Make a page of review problems and illustrate it. Make up an answer key, then switch problems with another student. 3. Working with a small group, select a shark to study. Find a picture of the shark, and look up the shark's length in a reference book. Use what you know about ratios and proportion to figure out the sizes of the shark's anatomical parts. For example, how long is the dorsal fin? How wide is the shark? As a class, order the groups' different sharks from largest to smallest based on actual size, not their photographs. Finally, make a life-size chalk drawing of your shark on the playground or black- top, making sure to accurately depict body parts and proportion. 4. What geometric shapes can you find in the shark's basic body structure and body parts? How do these geometric shapes help the shark? Compare these shapes to shapes found in other animals. 5. Find out how much students in your school know about sharks. As a class, make up a survey with 10- - o OCTOB ER 19 9 3</page><page sequence="4">cards with pictures of different sharks and use your classification key to find out the order to which each shark belongs. 5. Which shark order is of most interest to you? For example, do you think the Pristiophorisormes (sawsharks) are interesting? Design an imaginary new shark for the order you chose. Be sure that the shark has all the defining features of the order, but is clearly different from the other sharks in the order. Explain how your imaginary shark is adapted to its environment. 6. Great white sharks have been found to have a specific approach when they attack. Find a book that explains this. Draw a picture illus- trating the shark at each stage of the approach. If you can find a documentary on sharks, watch it to see if other sharks follow the same attack procedures. 15 questions such as the following: • What grade are you in? • Are you a boy or girl? • Do all sharks eat humans? • Do sharks lay eggs? • What is your favorite shark? • Have you seen a live shark? Where? With this survey as a guide, individually interview ten people of different ages. As a class, compile your data and analyze the results. Do more girls or boys like great white sharks the best? Do younger students know as much about sharks as older kids? Explore percentages: What percentage of girls are afraid of sharks? What percentage of boys are afraid of sharks? What percentage of second graders are afraid of sharks? What percentage of sixth graders are afraid of sharks? What would cause a difference? Make a graph showing some of the things the survey revealed. Language arts 1 . Jaws is Peter Benchley's exciting story about a killer shark. Make a list of sharks that have been known to attack humans and a list of those that have not attacked humans. What features are characteristic of each list? Do movies such as Jaws and Jaws II accurately portray sharks? Have any shark species thought to be harmless attacked humans? Write a scientifically accurate adventure story from a shark's point of view. For example, you could write about a member of the rare Megamouth or Goblin species. What would it do? What would its life be like? What enemies would it be fleeing from? 2. Write a cinquain poem about sharks. Cinquain poems are five lines long. The first line contains a single noun such as shark. The second line contains two adjectives describing the first line. The third line contains three verbs ending in -ing, the fourth line contains two adjectives, and the last line is the same single noun as the first line. Shark large, gray swimming, biting, hunting smooth, sharp Shark 3. Although in science class, anthropomorphism (giving human characteristics to creatures and objects that are not human) must be avoided, in language arts class the similar literary technique of personification is widely accepted. Many works of literature, such as Watership Down, Mrs. Frisbie and the Rats of Nimh, and Animal Farm, personify animals through- out. From both a scientific and a literary standpoint, discuss the pros and cons of personifying and anthropomorphizing animals. Choose a partner to portray a shark and interview him or her Before you begin, decide whether you want the interview to be based entirely on our scientific knowledge of sharks, or if your partner should creatively personify the shark. Be prepared to provide a reason for your decision. Ask your partner questions such as the following: • What do you eat? • Where do you live? • What are your enemies? • What are your friends? • How do you reproduce? • How large are you? • What color are you? • What is your scientific name? Switch roles, pretend that you are a different type of shark, and have your partner interview you. Extend this activity to put on a "Shark Talk Show" for classmates. Pretend that you are a talk-show host and interview shark "guests." 4. Write a letter to Sea World requesting information on sharks. Sea World addresses are listed below: Sea World of Ohio 1100 Sea World Drive Aurora, OH 44202 Sea World of California 1720 S. Shores Road San Diego, CA 92109 Sea World of Florida 7007 Sea World Drive Orlando, FL 32821 Sea World of Texas 1 0500 Sea World Drive San Antonio, TX 78251 5. As a class, write a script for a documentary on sharks. For example, if the class wants to produce a 30-minute documentary, divide up into pairs and each put together a 2-minute presentation on a specific topic. Include segments on the different orders of sharks, specific sharks, shark attacks, shark anatomy, and so on. Find pictures from books and magazines to illustrate your presentation, and videotape the documentary. .C-C. sc„„0 OCTOB ER 19 9 3</page><page sequence="5">Hie arts 1 . Design a pattern for a stuffed shark. This pattern should be designed so that it is three- dimensional when assembled. The shark may be stylized or propor- tionally and anatomically accurate. 2. Study the habitat of one of your favorite sharks. Does it live in the reefs or on the ocean bottom? Or is it an oceanic shark? What does it eat? What plants and other animal life are found in its living area? Make a diorama with a clay model or picture of your shark. Include the foods it eats and any other plant or animal life common to its habitat. 3. Many cultures have long histories of using masks in ceremo- nies and rituals. Go to the library and research masks from Africa, the South Pacific, and the Pacific Northwest Indians. How many different masks can you find depicting animals? Can you find any masks of sharks? Design your own mask. Try to copy the artistic style of one of the cultures you researched. You can use any type of art form and materials you like. For example, papier-mâché or paper bags make good masks. 4. Make a sculpture of your favorite shark. Use clay or another medium, as you prefer. Be as accurate and detailed as you can. Be sure to have the right type and number of fins, gill slits, spines, and so on. . Study the body shapes of different sharks. Some are round, some are long and slim, some have long heads and some have short heads. Check your sculpture against photographs and reference books for accuracy. Now look at the sculptures of Degas or any other famous sculptor. How would he or she change an "exact" model of a shark? Would you change yours? How? What would you communi- cate with these changes? 5. Make a relief map of the Pacific Ocean floor indicating which areas and depths are inhabited by specific sharks. In a box with one side cut away, use plaster of Paris, papier-mâché, or clay to form three-dimensional topographic features on the ocean floor. Suspend model sharks from thread or string from the top of the box into the scene at the proper depths. 6. Many different dances have been choreographed to represent types of animals. Watch a video of Swan Lake or the animals in The Nutcracker for ideas. Find a piece of music that seems "sharky" to you, maybe "Flight of the Bumble- bee" or 'The Theme from Jaws," and choreograph a dance to your selected music. Social studies 1 . Select five sharks from each order. Select a small, different- colored push pin for each order. For example, the Carcharhini- formes may be blue and the Pristiophorisormes may be red. Pin a world map on your bulletin board and look up the locales where each of your sharks live. Push each shark's pin into the map in the appropriate location. Do you see any patterns? Make predictions for a few more sharks, select pins for them, and see if your predictions hold true. 2. Have a food tasting party and sample shark steaks. Shark is available at most fish markets and many larger grocery stores. Try to find out which type of shark you are eating. Be sure to purchase only shark that is not endangered. If you can sample several different types of shark, are there differ- ences in color, texture, and taste? Pretend you are a food critic and devise a system to evaluate these qualities. 3. Talk with three adults and three students your age. Ask them what two things they are most afraid of and why or how they developed these fears. Ask if they are afraid of sharks and why. Sharks are probably not high on anyone's list of fears, but generally people have some fear of sharks. Why is this so? Are we really in danger when we swim in ocean waters? What do we or other people do to reinforce our fear of sharks? How is the fear of sharks different from other fears people tell you about? 4. Sharks have acquired a bad reputation because of stories or movies such as Jaws. Create a bumper sticker or poster showing some of the positive contributions of sharks.
