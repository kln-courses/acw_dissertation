<plain_text><page sequence="1">Insect Parental Care Douglas W. Tallamy Parental care in insects has evolved on numerous, separate occasions in connection with the exploitation of rigorous, dangerous, and competitive environments, but re- cent evidence suggests that it is an ecologically expensive trait that can only arise in the presence of intense selective pressure and specific behavioral precursors. (Accepted for publication 1 June 1983) The evolution of parental care repre- sents an extraordinary breakthrough in the adaptation of organisms to their envi- ronment. Its effectiveness in neutralizing conditions harmful to young is attested by the repeated convergence of parental behavior patterns throughout vastly dif- ferent animal lineages. Parental care is an important life history trait in many crustaceans, myriopods, arachnids, and insects in addition to mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. A consid- erable body of theory has been devel- oped to explain such parent-offspring interactions as the timing and degree of parental investment (Emlen 1970, Mi- linski 1980, Williams 1966), selfish con- flicts that arise between parents and their young (Trivers 1974), and sexual differ- ences in parental care (Maynard Smith 1977, Trivers 1972). Until recently, how- ever, widespread ignorance of inverte- brate social systems has almost exclu- sively restricted the testing of these theories to vertebrates. Among invertebrate social systems, the eusocial behavior of some Hymenop- tera (bees, wasps, and ants) and Isoptera (termites) has generated the most inter- est. In fact, constructing a unified theo- retical basis for the evolution of altruistic sterile castes in eusocial insects has chal- lenged evolutionary biologists ever since Darwin (1859) first proposed his theory of natural selection. In contrast, our knowledge of the array of more primitive social behaviors exhibited by insects has advanced beyond anthropomorphic de- scriptions in only a few cases. Excluding the Hymenoptera and the Isoptera, vari- ous complexities of presocial behavior (reviewed by Eickwort 1981) have evolved independently in 10 orders of insects. At the core of all levels of insect sociality lies parental care, i.e., any of several parent-offspring interactions that promote the survival, growth, and devel- opment of immature insects. In its most primitive state, parental care is limited to the physical protection of eggs and is extended only by parent females. Females of many true bugs (He- miptera) (Eberhard 1975, Melber and Schmidt 1977, Odhiambo 1960), thrips (Thysanoptera) (Hean 1943)1, webspin- ners (Embioptera) (Ledoux 1958)2, and hydrophilid beetles (Coleoptera) (Von Lengerken 1954), to name but a few, straddle their eggs to shield them from predators and parasites. Typically, guarding mothers aggressively attack predators and force them from the area (Bequaert 1935, Tallamy and Denno 1981a, Wood 1976). In fewer species, maternal protection extends beyond the egg stage. Prolonged periods of care are common in neotropical tortoise beetles (Windsor 1982) and four families of hy- menopterous sawflies (Dias 1975, 1976), whereas females of Gargaphia lace bugs (de la Torre Bueno 1942, Fink 1916, Weiss 1919) and several genera of mem- bracid treehoppers (Wood 1982) guard all immature stages of their young. EVOLUTION OF PARENTAL CARE It is clear that predation has driven the selection for parental care in many groups of insects, but predation is only one of several environmental forces to have done so. Wilson (1971) describes parental care as an evolutionary re- sponse to one of two environmental ex- tremes: unusually harsh or unusually fa- vorable conditions. The successful exploitation of harsh environments often requires specialized parental behaviors to ensure the survival of offspring. In- sects that rear their progeny in subterra- nean nests, for example, are frequently threatened by fungal invasion or oxygen deprivation. Earwig (Dermaptera) fe- males reduce the dangers from invading fungi by laboriously removing fungal spores and hyphae from their eggs (Lamb 1976). The staphylinid beetle, Bledius spectabilis Kraatz, rears its young in tunnels constructed under the intertidal mud flats of the European coast (Bro Larsen 1952). In this environ- ment hazardous oxygen shortages occur, and parent females must periodically ventilate their progeny by running back and forth throughout the tunnel network. Extremely favorable or rich environ- ments select for parental behavior in very different ways. Unusually favorable resources are, by definition, rare or ephemeral in nature. Because of their suitability, such resources are highly at- tractive and are often the sites of intense intraspecific competition. Parental care in the form of territorial behavior is a common means by which insects that breed in dung, carrion, or dead wood protect resources necessary for the de- velopment of their young from competi- tors. In fact, parental care among the beetles has reached a pinnacle in the Nicrophorous carrion beetles (Milne and Milne 1976, Pukowski 1933). Nicrophor- ous beetles rear their young on the corpses of small vertebrates. When a male locates a corpse, he releases a pheromone that attracts females to the site. In the event that more than one pair of beetles lays claim to the corpse, own- ership is determined by fighting. The victorious couple protect their prize from other carrion feeders by chewing and shaping it into a spherical mass and burying the mass in an excavated cham- ber. The female then molds the mass into a nest-like structure in which she lays her eggs. When the eggs hatch, the fe- male, and occasionally the male, feeds the larvae regurgitated liquids in much the same way that altricial birds feeds their nestlings. Although parental behavior is an adap- tation to environmental adversity, such as predation, competition, or harsh physical conditions, it is but one of a Tallamy is with the Department of Entomology and Applied Ecology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19711.

Bury- ing eggs in leaf tissue or scattering them through space and time can reduce pre- dation, for instance, just as effectively as providing parental protection (Tallamy and Denno 1981b). Which reproductive pattern evolves in a particular organism depends to a great extent on the pres- ence or absence of certain critical pread- aptations. Even the simplest of parental behaviors, for example, cannot occur in the absence of a suite of life history preadaptations. Foremost is the need to confine reproduction to specific periods and locations. Obviously, it is impossible to defend or care for progeny that are scattered through time and space. Paren- tal care also requires considerable adult longevity. Parents must not only survive to produce and lay eggs, but they must also live long enough to render some benefit to at least one and often several clutches of offspring. Finally, in the event that these prerequisites are met, the asocial behavior patterns of adults must contain certain basic elements from which natural selection can mold paren- tal behaviors that positively influence offspring survival. Specific parental be- haviors such as defensive posturing, overt aggression, nest building, and house cleaning are often simple exten- sions of behaviors exhibited by asocial insects. Asocial females in the lace bug genus Corythucha, for example, discour- age persistent males from uninvited sex- ual advances by fanning their wings and aggressively ramming the males head on (Tallamy unpublished data). It is not coincidental that these same behaviors form the basis of antipredator maternal defense in subsocial Gargaphia lace bugs (Tallamy and Denno 1981a). PARENTAL COSTS AND BENEFITS The benefits of parental care as a means of improving offspring survival are often self-evident, but such behavior patterns are not cost free. Parent insects that actively defend their young from predators, for example, risk costly phys- ical injury or even death. A less obvious problem is associated with clustering eggs in one spot, an essential prerequi- site for parental care. Insect eggs or prey items of any sort that are concentrated in one area may be more attractive to pred- ators than isolated eggs (Hassell 1978). Thus, insects that group their eggs to guard them, or for other reasons, may actually increase the probability of being attacked by predators. A third and po- tentially serious cost of parental care stems from the evolutionary decision to invest much time and energy in a few progeny rather than minimal amounts in many progeny. Insects that provide care for one group of offspring forfeit the chance to produce additional offspring, at least until the first group has reached self-sufficiency. This loss of fecundity is adaptive only if young that receive care reach reproductive maturity in suffi- ciently greater numbers than young that do not. The dynamic nature of these cost- benefit relationships is exemplified in the maternal behavior of the lace bug, Gar- gaphia solani Heidemann (Hemiptera: Tingidae) (Tallamy 1982, Tallamy and Denno 1981a, 1982). In this species, ma- ternal care has apparently evolved in response to intense predation on eggs and nymphs. If predators are excluded from this system (Figure 1), nearly 80% of the nymphal lace bugs survive to maturity with or without maternal pro- tection. When predators are not exclud- ed, however, maternal defense improves nymphal survivorship sevenfold. Clear- ly, maternal care is an effective solution to the predation problem facing G. so- lani, but it is also an ecologically expen- sive solution. A mother guards each clutch of her young through all five nymphal instars, a commitment of nearly one-half of her adult life span per clutch. Since egg production is physiologically suppressed throughout this period, ma- ternal behavior significantly reduces fe- cundity. In fact, females that consistent- ly abandon their eggs can lay more than twice as many eggs as females that guard. Thus maternal behavior in G. solani is balanced between two powerful selection pressures. On the one hand, there is pressure to protect young from relentless predation, for without protec- tion, nymphal survivorship is negligible. On the other hand, the reduction in fe- cundity that is associated with maternal care selects against such behavior. Recent evidence suggests that these opposing forces have given rise to an ecological compromise in G. solani fe- males not previously recognized in non- hymenopterous insects (Tallamy unpub- lished data). By facultatively parasitizing the maternal defensive behavior of con- specifics, it is possible for females to protect their progeny without limiting fecundity. Whenever possible, females oviposit in the recently established egg masses of neighboring females. In the process of guarding their own eggs, the neighbors inadvertently protect the eggs of egg donors. Donor lace bugs need not establish and guard their own masses as long as there are conspecific females with egg masses in the vicinity. Instead, they are free to lay as many eggs as physiologically possible without ceasing egg production during long periods of maternal care. The degree to which these interactions are truly parasitic depends on the as yet undetermined costs and benefits to egg donors and recipients. For example, it is possible that egg recipients benefit in some way from guarding more eggs than they could pro- duce alone or that the advantages of January 1984 21</page><page sequence="3">brood parasitism are tempered by costs such as increased egg mortality. In either case, the percentage of the female popu- lation exhibiting this behavior at any given time is constrained by the availability of females with egg masses in a stage vulnerable to parasitism. When susceptible females are scarce, gravid females must initiate and guard their own egg masses or face total loss to predators. In addition to brood parasitism, costs of maternal care are reduced in G. solani because the intensity with which moth- ers guard their young is inversely related to maternal reproductive value (Tallamy 1982). Defined by Fisher (1930), repro- ductive value is an age-specific measure of an organism's potential contribution to future generations. It is normally low at birth due to the probability of prema- ture death, peaks at the age of first reproduction when the number of ex- pected offspring is greatest, and declines to zero by the end of reproduction. If risk to defending parents is a function of the degree of parental defense, the inten- sity of defense should reflect the current reproductive value of the parent (Mi- linski 1980). That is, young parents with high reproductive values should take fewer risks to defend offspring than older parents whose potential contribution to future generations is limited. Emlen (1970) and Dawkins (1976) argue that parental defense is also an increasing function of the age or reproductive value of offspring. If protection is still neces- sary, parents should defend offspring that are nearing reproductive maturity more vigorously than they defend eggs or hatchlings because of the higher prob- ability of realizing returns on their defen- sive investments. These are precisely the patterns of maternal defense exhibited by G. solani (Tallamy 1982). Females attack ap- proaching predators more often, more quickly, and more aggressively while protecting their second clutch of off- spring than while guarding their first. Since females do not generally live long enough to produce a third clutch, there is little to lose and much to gain by guard- ing the second, final clutch as aggres- sively as possible. Within clutches moth- ers guard older nymphs with high reproductive values more actively than eggs or first instar nymphs. These data do not clearly distinguish between the influence of reproductive value and pos- sible effects from learning. They do sug- gest, however, that since eggs and first instar nymphs of the second clutch (Fig- ure 2, Period 1) are defended less than late instar nymphs of the first clutch (Figure 2, Period 2 and 3), learning should not be invoked as the sole expla- nation of these behavior patterns. WHO CARES? MATERNAL VS. PATERNAL INVESTMENT In the overwhelming majority of in- sects that care for their young, it is the female rather than the male that pro- vides the care. The reasons for this are varied and complex (Grafen 1980), but at least one important generality can be made. Females always can be certain that they are directly related to their offspring, whereas males cannot. Suc- cessful sperm transfer by no means as- sures a male of paternity. Multiple mat- ings are common among insects, and there is increasing evidence that often most eggs are fertilized by sperm re- ceived from the final mate (Boorman and Parker 1976, Prout and Bundgaard 1977, Smith 1979, Waage 1979). Rather than risk an investment of time and energy in unrelated progeny, males of most spe- cies begin and end their paternal invest- ment with copulation. However, there are important exceptions to this generality. The efficient exploitation of certain types of resources often requires the cooperative efforts of both parents. Us- ing rich and/or ephemeral resources such as dung, for example, has favored con- siderable paternal involvement in several species of dung beetles (Scarabaeidae) (Wilson 1971). Once located, a dung pat can provide more than enough nutrients for larval development, but it must first be secured and protected from competi- tors and then processed quickly before it dries beyond use. This is effectively ac- complished through task specialization by the parents. In the European scarab, Sisyphus schaefferi L., the male guards a dung pellet while the female excavates a subterranean brood chamber. Males of Copris lunaris L. assist their mates in preparing dung pellets and in excavating the nest. When the nest is completed, both parents remain in the enclosure until the young reach maturity (Fabre 1918). These examples suggest that whenever paternal investment is sub- stantial, mates function as monogamous pairs, at least during periods of repro- duction. In so doing, males are assured of their paternity. In a growing number of cases, howev- er, especially among the Hemiptera, pa- rental care is provided solely by the male. Without exception, the males in- 15 E E o) I 5 (I PERIOD I 2 3 I 2 3 CLUTCH ONE TWO Figure 2: Maternal defensive aggression in Gargaphia solani measured by the distance that mothers were willing to chase a simulated predator from their young.

In several tropical assassin bugs (Reduviidae), males protect their paternity by riding their mates from cop- ulation until oviposition, effectively pre- venting any additional matings (Od- hiambo 1959, Ralston 1977). After oviposition the male dismounts and straddles the eggs to guard them from parasites and predators. The most celebrated example of pater- nal care in insects has been described by Smith (1974, 1976a,b, 1979, 1980). Smith has shown that males in several genera of giant water bugs (Belostomatidae) al- low females to cement eggs to their backs for aeration and protection only if the females submit to repeated copula- tions before and during oviposition (Fig- ure 3). Such behavior nearly always guarantees paternity for the brooding male as demonstrated by the following. experiment with genetic markers. Among wild populations of the belosto- matid, Abedus herberti Hidalgo, there exists a dominant genetic marker that can be recognized by an aberrant longi- tudinal stripe running the length of the abdominal tergites. Using this marker to track sperm precedence, Smith (1979) paired a normal female alternately with a normal male and a striped male. The female was allowed to mate with and then lay three eggs on the back of the normal male, whereupon she was imme- diately removed to the striped male. Af- ter mating and laying three more eggs, she was returned to the normal male. This process was repeated until the fe- male had divided all of her eggs between two males. In spite of this competitive mating pattern, only 5 of the 250 nymphs produced were actually fathered by a male other than the male that had brood- ed their eggs. That is, almost all of the nymphs were fathered by the male that last copulated with the female before each egg batch was laid. Thus, the male strategy of frequent copulations with ovi- positing females is effective in assuring paternity, even in the face of extreme polygamy. CONCLUSION Though our knowledge of insect pa- rental care is in its infancy, some impor- tant evolutionary patterns are clear. Pa- rental care is the most common form of sociality in insects, having arisen repeat- edly and with great diversity in many insect taxa. The prevalence of parental behavior in insects is a reflection of its significance as a means of countering Figure 3: The copulation-oviposition se- quence in the giant water bug Abedus her- berti. Males of these aquatic insects protect and aerate eggs that are cemented to their backs by females. To ensure his paternity, a male will repeatedly interrupt a female during oviposition and, with his hind leg, force her to copulate (above). Following each copulatory interlude, the female returns to the male's back and resumes oviposition (below). This sequence is repeated until the female ce- ments her entire complement of eggs on the male (Photo courtesy of R. Smith). environmental adversity, but recent evi- dence suggests that parental care is an ecologically expensive life history trait that can only arise in the presence of intense selective pressure and specific behavioral precursors. To further our knowledge of the ecology, genetics, and evolutionary biology of insect parental behavior, we must diligently employ the tools of comparison and manipulation in a variety of insects. Without such an approach, we cannot hope to understand why some insects care for their young whereas others do not, or, more impor- tantly, the evolutionary relationship be- tween primitive forms of sociality and the more advanced eusocial behaviors in the Hymenoptera and Isoptera.
