McGrew Department of Sociology, Gerontology and Anthropology and Department of Zoology, Miami University, Oxford, Ohio 45056 KEY WORDS: tradition, social learning, intergroup differences, cultural evolution, behavioral ecology ABSTRACT Cultural primatology is hypothesized on the basis of social learning of group-specific behavior by nonhuman primates, especially in nature. Schol- ars ask different questions in testing this idea: what? (anthropologists), how? (psychologists), and why? (zoologists). Most evidence comes from five gen- era: Cebus (capuchin monkeys), Macaca (macaque monkeys), Gorilla (go- rilla), Pongo (orangutan), and Pan (chimpanzees). Two species especially, Japanese monkey (Macaca fuscata) and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), show innovation, dissemination, standardization, durability, diffusion, and tradition in both subsistence and nonsubsistence activities, as revealed by decades of longitudinal study. INTRODUCTION In the 1990s, a host of books have appeared, with titles like Chimpanzee Cul- tures (Wrangham et al 1994b); Chimpanzee Material Culture: Implications for Human Evolution (McGrew 1992); Great Ape Societies (McGrew et al 1996); Hominid Culture in Primate Perspective (Quiatt &amp; Itani 1994); The In- formation Continuum. Evolution of Social Information Transfer in Monkeys, Apes, and Hominids (King 1994); and Primate Behavior. Information, Social Knowledge, and the Evolution of Culture (Quiatt &amp; Reynolds 1993). Clearly, the wording is deliberate, and some scholars now feel comfortable describing the existence of culture in primates other than humans. The aim of this chapter is to scrutinize these efforts at cultural primatology in trying to answer the question posed in the title. 301 0084-6570/98/1015-0301 $08.00</page><page sequence="2">302 MCGREW The answers offered to the question by various interested parties run the full gamut from "Of course!" to "Nonsense!" The former see a gradation of quanti- tative (not qualitative) differences in sociocognitive abilities across phyla, so that natural and cultural phenomena are inextricable. An extreme example of this viewpoint was Bonner's The Evolution of Culture in Animals (1980), in which the microbiologist traced the roots of culture as far back as the slime molds (Myxomycetes). In contrast, the latter see a yawning gap between Homo sapiens and even the largest-brained species of living mammal, no matter how closely we and they are genetically related. For the skeptics, if culture is a uniquely and essentially human phenomenon, then the general question is just as pointless as a specific one, like "Are humans the only species to build space- ships?" In between these polar positions are degrees of skepticism or inclina- tion, the variation in which needs to be explained (Premack &amp; Premack 1994, Tomasello et al 1993a). Asking the question is not new: Kroeber (1928) contemplated it 70 years ago. Although coming to a negative conclusion, he was willing to frame a set of testable criteria, based on what he knew of Kohler's (1927) pioneering stud- ies of captive chimpanzees: If one ape devised or learnt a new dance step, or a particular posture, or an at- titude toward the object about which the dance revolved; and if these new acts were taken up by other chimpanzees, and became more or less standard- ized; especially if they survived beyond the influence of the inventor, were taken up by other communities, or passed on to generations after him in that case, we would legitimately feel that we were on solid ground of an ape culture. (Kroeber 1928:331) The extent to which the titular question has been explicitly addressed has varied across decades (e.g. Hart &amp; Panzer 1925, Menzel 1973, Nishida 1987, Thierry 1994), but here the emphasis is on new findings and insights, with his- torical aspects kept to a minimum. The question posed does not read: Is culture found only in living humans? That would entail a much different critique about the origins of culture in pre- history: Has culture existed since literacy emerged in the Holocene? Since the advent of depiction in the Upper Paleolithic? Since the appearance of anatomi- cally modem humans? (But what about Neanderthals?) Since the global dis- persal of large-brained Homo erectus? Since the onset of lithic technology in earliest African Homo? Since the origin of bipedal Pliocene hominids? At some point our antecedents were nonhuman primates, but were they culture- bearers? To tackle these questions requires a paleoarcheological approach (e.g. Joulian 1996), with one huge constraint: All the subjects of study are ex- tinct (Foley 1991). This chapter is also not about theories of the evolution of culture, in particu- lar, models that explore parallels between organic or genetic evolution and cul-</page><page sequence="3">CULTURE IN NONHUMAN PRIMATES? 303 tural evolution (Durham 1990, Boyd &amp; Richerson 1985). These theories vary from the speculative to the formulaic, from the heuristic to the pontifical, from the empirical to the notional, but few concern themselves with the ethnography of other species. What Is Culture? The simplest reason for disagreement over whether or not nonhuman primates have culture is definitional. Like all complex processes-consciousness, intel- ligence, language, and so on-culture has been defined from the broadest, loos- est, and most inclusive ways to the narrowest, most precise, and most specific. Ex- amples of the former may border on the epigrammatic: "Culture is the human ecological niche." "Culture is what human beings do." Examples of the latter approximate to checklists of features to be ticked off, inviting challenges, such as what to do with a hypothetical creature that has language, property rights, and taboos but lacks kinship terms, religious rites, and aesthetics. Tylor's (1871) classic definition spans the range: "Culture ... is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, law, morals, custom, and any other ca- pabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society." (1 871: 1). There is plenty of room for honest disagreement over the uniqueness of any one of these items, even before tackling the catch-all ending phrase. Depend- ing on how one operationally defines a habit, which could range from a condi- tioned reflex to a ritual prayer, any number of species could be credited with the feature, or not. Further bedeviling the exercise is the a priori assumption made by Tylor and many others (Kroeber &amp; Kluckhohn 1963) that culture is by definition hu- man. Logically, this preempts debate, so the answer to the titular question must be no, but resorting to this weasel-out merely passes the buck on to the ques- tion of what is humanness. Would we deny humanity to Homo (sapiens) nean- derthalensis? To anatomically modern but apparently non-symbol-using Homo sapiens before about 40,000 years ago? To fire-using earlier hominids? The further we go into the past, the fuzzier things get, until we reach the Last Common Ancestor of living chimpanzees and living humans, at about 5 mil- lion years ago. To define culture as uniquely human may be logically tidy, but it is epistemologically suspect. As if this were not enough, the presence or absence of culture in either the present or the past in nonhuman creatures could be a result of phyletic conser- vatism or of derived convergence (McGrew 1992). If the ancestral hominoid had culture, then its absence in living great apes could have been a secondary loss, just as overall body hair, grasping feet, and slashing canine teeth are ab- sent in living humans. If the ancestral hominoid lacked culture, it could later have evolved independently more than once, in nonancestral forms that went</page><page sequence="4">304 MCGREW extinct, or more recently in extant apes. When we find wild chimpanzees using stone hammers and anvils to crack nuts, it could have been invented once 10 million years ago and retained ever since, or several times only a few decades ago in scattered populations. Arguments about the origins of culture that rely only on homology fail to consider the analogical alternatives. Another way to avoid confronting the titular question is to relabel the prob- lem. For various reasons, pre- 1 990s investigators often dichotomized human culture and nonhuman "culture," proto-culture, pre-culture, sub-culture, quasi-culture, etc. (e.g. Kawai 1965). These may be valid distinctions, because each species' cultural heritage is likely to be as unique as its genetic inheri- tance of DNA. Bonobo culture should not be identical to chimpanzee culture any more than to human culture or to honey bee culture. However, the fact that, for example, human digestion differs from gorillas' does not stop us from con- sidering it to be a largely comparable process, so why should culture be differ- ent? Missing from such relative labels are clear, testable criteria for distin- guishing the ersatz from the real thing. Everything said so far about the possibility of nonhuman culture relies on cultural acts (= behavior) in the present or on the products of those acts (= arti- facts) in the past. If either is a necessary but not sufficient condition for culture, then methodological problems arise. If culture is knowledge (= information stored in brains) or meaning (= attributions assigned to such knowledge by minds), but neither of these is directly accessible, then what is to be done? Eth- nologists infer knowledge and meaning from observation and communication with their human subjects, and students of nonhuman societies do the same. Each faces obstacles. Human informants are adept deceivers, by omission or commission, while nonhumans are far more spontaneous. Humans can be in- duced to engage in two-way, linguistic communication, while nonhumans can- not, at least in nature. Investigators of other species must constantly walk the line between anthropomorphism and anthropocentrism. Anthropomorphism brings with it the temptation to overly extend the principle of uniformitarian- ism. Anthropocentrism must remain mindful of the old adage "absence of evi- dence is not evidence of absence." One way to ascertain culture is to focus on process. Following Kroeber (1 928:33 1), if one saw: 1. a new pattern of behavior being invented, or an existing one being modi- fied; 2. transmission of this pattern from the innovator to another; 3. the form of the pattern being consistent within and across performers, per- haps even recognizably stylized; 4. the pattern persisting in the repertoire of the acquirer long after the demon- strator was absent;</page><page sequence="5">CULTURE IN NONHUMAN PRIMATES? 305 5. the pattern spreading across social units, be those families or clans, or across troops or bands, in a population; 6. the pattern enduring across generations; then one might feel able to accord cultural status to that pattern. Insisting on all six criteria may be overly strict, as few ethnographers of hu- man culture have ever been lucky enough to witness innovation or lived long enough to follow it prospectively through to established tradition. On the other hand, when animals behave in the presence of humans, their performances are always potentially distorted by human influence, e.g. circus tricks. Whether manipulated genetically (by domestication) or ontogenetically (by foster rear- ing, especially in human homes), humanized nonhumans are uneasy compos- ite creatures, unlikely to be informative about the results of natural selection. Few of the primary reports cited below are both precise and explicit in their definition of culture. Of those that are, even fewer agree. On pragmatic grounds, the definition adopted here casts the net widely, to be as inclusive as possible: Culture is considered to be group-specific behavior that is acquired, at least in part, from social influences. Here, group is considered to be the species-typical unit, whether it be a troop, lineage, subgroup, or so on. Prima facie evidence of culture comes from within-species but across-group varia- tion in behavior, as when a pattern is present in one community of chimpan- zees but is absent in another, or when communities perform different versions of the same pattern. The suggestion of culture in action is stronger when the difference across the groups cannot be explained solely by ecological factors acting independently but simultaneously on individuals; e.g. presence or ab- sence of resources may dictate across-group differences in foraging without any social learning being involved. Thus, diversity in social relations is easier to disentangle from such environment constraints than are subsistence activi- ties. However, the interaction of nature and nurture is always tricky, even for humans: Variation can be innate, and similarity can be acquired. Who Studies Culture? Culture is no longer the exclusive domain of anthropology, at least when other species are involved. This recent expansion of interest has caused confusion, if only because different academic disciplines ask different questions, even when they think these questions look the same. For putative culture in nonhu- man primates, there are at least three distinct points of view: anthropology, psychology, and zoology, and primatologists may come from all of these disci- plines. Anthropologists tend to ask what questions about the constitution of culture in other primates. Ethnologists question whether a nonlinguistic creature could ever be cultural or how one might be able to study culture adequately without</page><page sequence="6">306 MCGREW interrogating informants (Washburn &amp; Benedict 1979). Archaeologists ask what might constitute an artifact for another species or how one might recover the past material culture of chimpanzees (Joulian 1996, Wynn &amp; McGrew 1989). The emphasis is on culture as phenomenon. Psychologists tend to ask how questions that concern mechanisms of cul- tural dissemination, that is, the cognitive processes by which socially acquired information is transmitted, individual to individual (Cheney &amp; Seyfarth 1990, Fragaszy &amp; Visalberghi 1990, Lefebvre 1995). Thus, there is a fascination with the details of means, as opposed to ends. (Figure 1 diagrams an array of mimetic processes that may be implicated in cultural transmission, Whiten &amp; Ham 1993). Comparative psychologists working in laboratories or zoological parks design experiments to distinguish higher-order cognitive capacities such as imitation from lower-order capacities such as stimulus enhancement plus trial-and-error learning (Tomasello 1996, Visalberghi &amp; Fragaszy 1990, Whiten et al 1996). Developmental psychologists compare the ontogenies of mother-reared individuals, nursery-reared individuals, and human-reared indi- viduals, in an effort to disentangle the key variables that contribute to success- ful or unsuccessful performances (Boinski &amp; Fragaszy 1989, Hauser 1993, Nagell et al 1993, Tomasello et al 1994, Call &amp; Tomasello 1996). The empha- sis is on culture as learning process. Zoologists tend to ask wh.y questions that concern the function or survival value of culture, using the theory and concepts of Darwinian evolutionary ecology. Ethologists focus on the motor patterns of spontaneous perform- ances, especially in nature, with a view to being able to calculate the cost- benefit trade-offs of a cultural act. Why do some primates hunt more coopera- tively and others less so, for the same species of prey (Boesch 1994b)? Behav- ioral ecologists apply optimal foraging theory to social aspects of subsistence. Why would any organism ever voluntarily give away food, much less a re- source like knowledge (de Waal 1989b)? The emphasis is on culture as adapta- tion. To answer the questions posed at the outset, all three disciplines are needed (King 1994, McGrew 1992, de Waal 1994, Parker 1996, Parker &amp; Russon 1996). If human culture is embedded in primate culture, then primate culture may be embedded in mammalian culture, which may be embedded in verte- brate culture. But anthropologists tend to stick to primates, just as psycholo- gists focus on domesticated, laboratory species, leaving only zoologists to range widely across phyla. The vast literature on song learning by passerine birds, which is easily the most elegant and extensive on any aspect of social learning, has been done almost entirely by behavioral biologists (Marler 1996). Laboratory primatologists are the only ones who can do controlled ex- periments; field primatologists can systematically intervene in natural settings (Matsuzawa 1994, 1996), but only carefully and to a limited extent, lest they</page><page sequence="7">CULTURE IN NONHUMAN PRIMATES? 307 NON-SOCIAL CONVERGENCE| PROCESSES Mimicry arises m act bESE o without social _. interaction of qeMIMICRY o Aoand B DIVIDUAL LEARNING CONTAGION P A's act is merely stimulus for similar act by B EXPOSURE SOCIAL By beinC with A, B Is INFLUENCE _ exposed to similarNM B is infBuenced learning environment by A but does_ .\ not learn any SOCIAL SUPPORT\ part of mimicry B more likely lo learn t from A _ similar act because ofvo effect of A's presence \ \ on B's motivation MATCHED DEPENDENT \ \ LEARNING c a MIM/IETIC B learns to use act of be PROCESSES _pA's which happens to be th a r Processes leading similar to B's, as tni to behavioral discriminant sign conformity, .

All can capitalize on natu- ralistic settings, such as wildlife parks, to manipulate variables such as socioe- cological contexts, but only in nature can primates be studied in their environ- ment of evolutionary adaptedness, with the corresponding ecological validity that is crucial to keeping the whole enterprise on course. In light of this, and given the burgeoning literature on the subject, this synthesis stresses primary, ethnographic data rather than parroting secondary commentary, of which there is plenty (Boesch 1996, Byrne 1995, Parker 1996, Parker &amp; Russon 1996).</page><page sequence="8">308 MCGREW OTHER CULTURES? Both communities live along the PaciJic Coast of British Columbia and soutth- eastern Alaska. One subsists largely on marine mammals, such as seals and dolphins, they humnt in small, silent parties, roving widely. The otherfoclises on fish, especially schools ofsalmon; thei' hutnt in big, noisy groulps and stay close to home. Both societies speak the same language, buit iwith distinct dialects that differ even from group to group. Extended families work together to collect and store a staple plant food upon which all individuals depend. Division of labor is central. While some family members maintain the granary, others seek animal prey that are brought home jbr sharing. ,411 combine efforts to rear commulnally thefjamil 's youngsters, with some siblings postponing their reprodluction in order to care for younger kin. If a parent dies, a replacement nate is sought fiom outside, rather than commit incest. Family life is a tricky comnpromise of cooperation and competition over generations. Is the first example reminiscent of the seagoing peoples of the Pacific Northwest, with their great canoes, soaring lodge poles, and exuberant pot- latches? In fact, the paragraph describes orcas (or killer whales), Orcinus orca (Barrett-Lennard et al 1996). Is the second example an intriguing combination of a Great Basin foraging society like the Paiute and a utopian colony of Hutterites or Kibbutzniks? In fact, the paragraph encapsulates the life of acorn woodpeckers, Melanerpes formicivorous (Stacey &amp; Koenig 1984). The natural history of group-living vertebrates is full of candidates for cul- ture among species other than primates, and there is a long-standing tradition of such referential modeling that dates back at least as far as Morgan's (1868) celebration of the beaver (Castor polllix). Among mammals, other well-known examples are sea otters (Lutra enhydra), in which Californian populations use stone anvils to smash open molluscs but their Alaskan counterparts do not (Hall &amp; Schaller 1964). Among birds, male bower birds (Ptilonorhynchidae) of New Guinea erect gaudily decorated structures that incorporate everything from moss to butter- flies' wings, to attract a mate (Diamond 1987). Styles, including color prefer- ences, vary across populations, but so do individual "signatures": One male may decorate his bower with shiny beetle heads, while another prefers acorns. Primate longevity and long generation times make the prospective study of cultural processes prohibitive: To follow vertical transmission in long-lived apes takes decades (see below). Thus, one is forced to turn to nonprimates for comprehensive alternatives. Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) are brood-parasites; they lay their eggs in the nests of other species, who rear the interlopers. Yet, male cowbirds must later</page><page sequence="9">CULTURE IN NONHUMAN PRIMATES? 309 sing the species- and population-specific song of their genetic parents (whom they never meet) and ignore the song of their foster parents if they are to attract a cowbird mate. How they learn to do so has taken years of integrated study be- tween field and lab, with the conclusion that local dialects in male cowbirds depend ultimately on developmental shaping by female cowbirds (who do not sing!). Female responsiveness reinforces male song learning, resulting in lo- cally preferred patterns of behavior (West &amp; King 1996). Black rats (Rattus rattus) in Israeli pine plantations have opportunistically become "ecological squirrels," to the extent of adopting arboreality and de- pending on pine seeds for food. Such enterprising exploitation entailed the in- vention of novel ways to disarticulate a pine cone; this occurred far too quickly for genetic adaptation. Terkel (1996) and his students have methodically dis- sected the transmission of the food harvesting and processing patterns from mother to offspring by a combination of field and lab studies that includes even the relative metabolic efficiencies of the "stripping" versus "shaving" tech- niques. It is a sobering thought that no study of comparable phenomena in hu- man beings by ecological anthropologists, or anyone else, matches this re- search on rodents in terms of rigor or elegance. NONHUMAN PRIMATES The Order Primates contains about 200 species, ranging from tiny, solitary, nocturnal mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) to the huge, polygynous, diurnal gorilla (Gorilla gorilla). However, for the vast majority of these species, the possibility of culture has been ignored. A 12-year (1986-1997) bibliography from the Primate Information Center (1997) showed that for references that specified their subjects to genus, only five genera (Cebus, Gorilla, Macaca, Pan, Pongo) accounted for 80% of entries. Of these, 52% came from one spe- cies alone, the chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes. What explains this skew? Three of the five genera cover the four species of great apes (bonobo, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan), and another, Cebus, comprises the capuchin monkeys, a genus often likened to being the monkey equivalent to the great apes (Anderson 1996, Fragaszy et al 1990, Westergaard 1994). All have relatively large brains and are noted for their opportunistic style of extractive foraging in nature and for their superior abilities at problem solving in captivity. The fifth genus, Macaca, is a large, widespread radiation of Old World monkeys known for their adaptability; over half of the macaque references come from one species, Macacafuscata, the Japanese monkey. No- tably near-absent are two other well-studied genera of Old World monkeys, Papio (baboons) and Cercopithecus (guenons); had the bibliographic search extended earlier than 1986, their numbers would likely have been greater (see Nishida 1987 for earlier material).</page><page sequence="10">310 MCGREW More telling than phylogeny, however, may be methodology. Four of the five genera represent taxa that have been subject to decades of long-term be- havioral research in the wild. (The exception is Cebus; although Cebus apella is well studied in captivity at various sites, it is little studied in nature.) Field sites such as Bossou, Gombe, Kibale, Mahale, and Tai (chimpanzee); Arashi- yama, Koshima, Takasakiyama, Yakushima (Japanese monkey); Karisoke (mountain gorilla); and Tanjung Puting (Bornean orangutan) have each yielded thousands of hours of close-range observations over multiple genera- tions of subjects. This point has simple but crucial implications, e.g. we cannot spot what is novel unless we know what is usual, and we cannot know what is usual until we have seen enough, especially for rare but important events. No- tably, most of these studies have used provisioning, the offering of artificial foods by observers to tame wild primates to human presence. However, enough of the sites (Karisoke, Kibale, Tai, Tanjung Puting, Yakushima) have not used provisioning that one need not directly attribute cultural phenomena in nonhuman primates to such human influence. This critical review concentrates on the primate taxa about which the most is known but always keeps in mind that ongoing research may yield new find- ings: Wild orangutans have been studied since the late 1960s, but the discovery that they regularly use tools came only in the mid-1990s (Fox et al 1998, van Schaik et al 1996). This review concentrates on behavioral patterns that occur habitually (repeatedly by several individuals in a group) or customarily (nor- mally by all individuals of appropriate age, sex, and status in a group). There- fore anecdotal or idiosyncratic events are omitted, but it is always recognized that these events could later prove to be important. Earlier reviews of culture in nonhuman primates provide useful background information to the newer ma- terial presented here (Menzel 1973, Nishida 1987, Lethmate 1987, Thierry 1994). Capuchin (Cebus spp.) The four species of capuchin monkey have been studied in nature since the 1960s, over the genus's wide range from Central to South America (Fragaszy et al 1990). Long-term behavioral data from identified individuals are avail- able for two of these, Cebus olivaceus, the wedge-capped capuchin, in Vene- zuela (Robinson &amp; Janson 1987) and Cebus capucinus, the white-throated or white-faced capuchin, in Costa Rica (Fedigan 1990). In captivity, almost all research focuses on Cebus apella, the brown or tufted capuchin, from laborato- ries in Europe or the United States (Westergaard 1994, Visalberghi 1997, An- derson 1996). Cebus albifrons, the white-fronted capuchin of Amazonian rain- forests, is least known in any setting. The best-known population of wild Cebus is that of the dry forests of Santa Rosa in northwestern Costa Rica (Fedigan 1990). Three neighboring groups of</page><page sequence="11">CULTURE IN NONHUMAN PRIMATES? 311 white-throated capuchin show differing diets in terms of ratios of fruit to in- sects to meat. Chapman &amp; Fedigan (1990) tested three hypotheses to explain this: (a) relative abundance of prey, (b) relative profitability (costs and benefits in terms of nutrients, energetics), and (c) local traditions. The first and most ecologically deterministic was disproven, but the second and third could not be distinguished. Individual monkeys may choose the best balance of dietary items in terms of optimal foraging principles, or groups may develop local tra- ditions that transcend environmental constraints. The basis for such across- group variation is present in within-group variation across sexes and age groups (Fragaszy &amp; Boinski 1995) and in across-species variation in finding and processing such food as social insects (Janson &amp; Boinski 1992). Capuchin monkeys sometimes show uncanny parallels to their distantly re- lated chimpanzee counterparts, e.g. in hunting, sharing, and eating the flesh of mammals (Fedigan 1990). The best data come from Santa Rosa (Rose 1997), where C. capucinus preys regularly on squirrels (Sciurus varigatoides) and coatis (Nasua nasica). Males pursue adult squirrels, usually in groups, while females rob coatis of their nestling young. This behavior mirrors that of chim- panzees: Male chimpanzees specialize in hunting arboreal monkeys, while fe- male chimpanzees more often take the cached young of ungulates (Goodall 1986). Both chimpanzees and capuchins share the meat, mostly from mother to offspring, but rates of sharing vary across seasons and across groups for capu- chins, being most frequent in the lean times of the dry season (Rose 1997). The single best corpus of knowledge on material culture in nonhuman pri- mates in captivity comes from C. apella (Westergaard 1994). However, almost all the data have been enabled (goals and raw materials supplied) or induced (programmed in experimental protocols) by human collaborators rather than shown spontaneously by the monkeys. Capuchin can do everything that chim- panzees can do, and more, with regard to making and using tools from wood, bone, bamboo, and metal (e.g. Anderson 1990). Many of the tasks performed model those inferred for early hominids, e.g. flaking stone, throwing missiles, digging up food items, using containers, and cracking open bones (e.g. Wester- gaard &amp; Suomi 1995; see listing in McGrew &amp; Marchant 1997). However, none of these activities has yet been seen to be even habitual, much less cus- tomary in nature. In summary, capuchin monkeys are highly intelligent and manipulative pri- mates whose extractive, generalist foraging style supplies the potential for cul- tural variation. However, the only behavioral variation across groups seen so far in the wild has been closely tied to environmental factors, and no social tra- ditions have yet been identified. That the genus has the cognitive capacity for cultural acts is clear from laboratory studies, but fieldwork of the depth and ex- tent of that on other primates is needed, especially on C. apella (Visalberghi &amp; McGrew 1997).</page><page sequence="12">312 MCGREW Macaques (Macaca spp.) The adaptive radiation of Old World macaques is the most widely distributed of any primate genus; macaques are found primarily in Asia, but they are also found in Africa and Europe. More important for this discussion, macaques are perhaps the most ecologically diverse of nonhuman primates. They are found naturally from tropical mangrove swamps to temperate montane conifer forests. Introduced populations thrive on islands in the Outer Banks of the Carolinas and in the cactus scrubland of West Texas (Clark 1979). It is not surprising that such eclecticism is sometimes expressed in cultural diversity (Hauser 1996). One species of macaque, the Japanese monkey, is familiar to anthropolo- gists because their inclusion in introductory textbooks is almost obligatory (Itani &amp; Nishimura 1973). These are the sweet-potato-washing and wheat- sluicing beach monkeys of Koshima Island, in the south of Japan (Kawamura 1959). This population may be the longest-studied of any wild primates; 1998 marks the fiftieth year of research. The story is well known: In 1953, a juvenile female, Imo, spontaneously washed a muddy sweet potato in a stream. This food-processing technique first spread horizontally to peers and then vertically upward to older kin; in less than 10 years it became the norm for the group, and over generations, it assumed predominance, being shown by 46 of 57 monkeys by 1983 (Watanabe 1994). In 1956, Imo invented wheat-sluicing, in which handfuls of mixed sand and wheat grains were cast upon the sea, so that the floating cereal could be skimmed from the surface (Kawai 1965). This habit spread more slowly, but by 1974-1975, it had become the norm, shown by 43 of 77 individuals above the age of dependent infants, and by 1983-1984, the technique was used by 93% of the group (Kawai et al 1992). A third, striking example of newly acquired behavior by Japanese monkeys comes from much further north, in the snowy forests of Honshu: hot-spring bathing (Suzuki 1965). In the Shiga Heights, monkeys leamed to spend their leisure time on cold days immersed in natural hot springs, when they were not otherwise engaged in literally scraping a living from eating bark. When presented in secondary literature, these patterns tend to be seen as static (Galef 1992, Tomasello et al 1993a), but longitudinal studies show them to be dynamic. Early on, Koshima monkeys changed from washing potatoes in freshwater to washing them in seawater, apparently adding seasoning to hy- giene. By 1983-1984, the most common form of washing was repeated dip- ping for saltiness, even when the tuber was clean (Watanabe 1994). In wheat sluicing, dominant individuals learned to parasitize the labor of subordinates, by waiting until the latter had thrown their sand-grain mix into the water and then usurping it. Subordinates adopted a range of countermeasures, such as keeping the mix loosely gripped in the fist while sluicing, thus never losing</page><page sequence="13">CULTURE IN NONHUMAN PRIMATES? 313 control of the food. By 1983-1984, some individuals were digging their own small pools near the shore to practice solitary flotation, which provides more security from plunder (Kawai et al 1992). In the beginning, mothers entering hot springs left their young infants at the edge (Suzuki 1965), but now young- sters swim underwater in the pools. All of these long-standing patterns of behavior satisfy Kroeber's (1928) crite- ria for culture given above, but two caveats arise: They are restricted to basic subsistence activities, that is, feeding or thermoregulation, and all result directly from human influence. The monkeys were drawn to Koshima's beaches by pro- visioning with cultivars by investigators seeking to facilitate their observations. At Shiga Heights, apples were thrown into the hot springs by researchers. Green (1975) suggested that the preferential distribution of sweet potatoes effectively shaped the vocal behavior of Koshima's monkeys, amounting to differential op- erant conditioning that might explain across-group differences in their calls. Does this mean that Japanese monkey culture is only an artificial phenomenon? No, patterns of culture also exist for nonsubsistence behavior: Sakura (1989) showed that contact calls in grooming varied across troops and that such grooming was divorced from the provisioning process. Tanaka (1995) found that four techniques for removing louse eggs in grooming differed across matrilines in a wild but provisioned group at Jigokudani. The same sort of differences emerged in the courtship gestures and postures of both males and females in three widely separated groups (Stephenson 1973). At Koshima, the dominant male began to masturbate regularly during the breeding season; within three years all the leader and subleader males were doing it (Stephenson 1973). In captive groups, other nonsubsistence patterns have emerged sponta- neously and become established: making snowballs big enough to sit on (Ea- ton 1972), propping up heavy branches against barriers as ladders (Machida 1990), using stones in social grooming (Weinberg &amp; Candland 1981). However, the best-documented case of nonsubsistence cultural activity is the enigmatic habit of stone handling (Huffman 1984, 1996; Huffman &amp; Quiatt 1986). Japanese monkeys pile, pick up, scatter, roll, rub, clack, carry, cuddle, drop, toss, push pebbles collected from the ground. None of the acts accom- plishes any goal; the stones are not used as tools. Since its first observation in 1979, stone handling has spread to the majority of the Arashiyama troop, and by the late 1980s, all infants had acquired it within six months of birth (Huff- man 1996). The custom has now been seen in five other geographically iso- lated populations. It is a widespread, daily occurrence of no known function. Examples of new subsistence activities that are unrelated to provisioning are also known: Since becoming denizens of the beach, Koshima's monkeys have learned to eat dead fish washed ashore and to go into the water to capture small octopus (Watanabe 1989). A replication of the invention of food- washing has occurred in a Dutch zoo: Before 1981, the monkeys washed their</page><page sequence="14">314 MCGREW food only in a pool, but in that year, a female started to use a watering spout elsewhere; by 1985, 12 of the 26 monkeys were following suit (Scheurer &amp; Thierry 1985). Monkeys living far from the sea wash dirty roots in a stream; these are natural foodstuffs, not provisioned ones (Nakamichi et al 1998). An adult female at Jigokudani invented a stone-throwing technique to solve a tool- use problem presented by researchers; it was later adopted by three other group members (Tokida et al 1994). However, the most compelling evidence comes from populations that have never been provisioned: Monkeys on Yakushima Island specialize in preying on frogs and lizards, unlike any other Japanese monkeys (Suzuki et al 1990). Overall, various populations of Japanese monkeys, both captive and wild, have shown a variety of behavioral patterns that fulfill the criteria for culture. These customns range from subsistence to social to recreational, with the richest data coming from studies in which generations of researchers have studied generations of monkeys. For other Macaca spp., surprisingly little is known about cultural phenom- ena, except for studies of social learning by offspring from their mothers. For example, differences are well known in maternal behavior across groups and across matrilines within groups of rhesus monkeys, Macaca mulatta (Simpson &amp; Howe 1986). Often such variation is linked to matrilineal rank, but de Waal (1996) showed that even after kinship had been factored out, the social rela- tions of mothers predicted those of their daughters with other females but not with males, suggesting the transmission of maternal style. Moreover, Berman (1990) found that for free-ranging rhesus macaques, the weaning techniques of adult females more closely resembled those demonstrated by their mothers to their younger siblings than those received by themselves. Thus, what they saw was more influential than what they experienced. Sometimes, rhesus macaque mothers could be inventive: In two captive groups, mothers displayed the "double hold," that is, simultaneously embracing their offspring and that of an- other female (de Waal 1990). The other offspring held did not appear to be chosen because of their sex or kinship, but they were much more likely to be of higher rank, suggesting that mothers were acting so as to encourage "social climbing" for their young. Such questions of social development always raise issues of nature versus nurture, given that many factors may co-vary. One way to tease apart these in- fluences is cross-fostering, such as swapping at birth the offspring of high- and low-ranking mothers, all other things being equal, and following the life histo- ries of the offspring. No such studies seem to have been done. However, some cross-fostering across closely related species has been done on a small-scale: The vocalizations of cross-fostered Japanese and rhesus monkeys have been compared, but with little effect (Owren et al 1993). Most of the time, the youngsters exhibited the species-typical calls of their genetic parents. On the</page><page sequence="15">CULTURE IN NONHUMAN PRIMATES? 315 other hand, rhesus and stump-tailed macaque (Macaca arctoides) juveniles were co-housed for 22.5 weeks and then returned to their same-species groups. The rhesus juveniles persisted in their acquired style of frequent reconciliation after quarrels, 'a la stump-tails, but the other four measures of social relations were unchanged (de Waal &amp; Johanowicz 1993). In summary, it is hard to know if the cultural behavior of Japanese monkeys is somehow intrinsic to the species or if it is a reflection of the extent, depth, and type of research done on M fuscata. Until comparable studies, especially of other wild macaques, are done, this remains an open question. Great Apes (Pongidae-Hominidae) Five living species make up the Hominoidea clade: human (Homo sapiens); orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus, two subspecies); gorilla (Gorilla gorilla, three subspecies); bonobo or pygmy chimpanzee (Pan paniscus); and chimpanzee (P. troglodytes, four subspecies). As our nearest living relations, all great apes are automatically candidates for culture, but as stated above, most research has been on chimpanzees. The other chimpanzee, P. paniscus, is the least known of all apes. Fewer than a hundred are in captivity; wild bonobos inhabit only one country, Congo (formerly Zaire), and there are only two ongoing field sites, Lomako and Wamba (de Waal &amp; Lanting 1997). The captive bonobos outside Africa are scattered in small groups, and species management plans for captivity lead to frequent migrations, so their cultural life is constrained. However, customs can occasionally be seen: The bonobos of San Diego Zoo habitually clap their hands to gain one another's attention, and as their offspring have dispersed to other zoos, the behavior pattern has diffused with them (de Waal 1989a). The obvious starting point in seeking bonobo culture is to draw compari- sons with their close relative, P. troglodytes. Comparing material culture is handicapped by the bonobos' virtual lack of tool use in the wild; they habitu- ally use no tools in subsistence or conflict, the two main categories for chim- panzees (Ingmanson 1996). When material culture can be compared, as with nest-building, the similarities stand out, with few exceptions, suggesting nest- building to be a deep-seated, ancestral trait (Fruth &amp; Hohmann 1994, 1996). When differences do emerge between Lomako and Wamba, such as in the size of foraging parties, these can be attributed to greater habituation or provision- ing at Wamba and lesser habituation and no provisioning at Lomako (White 1996). Thus, ecological or methodological variables can explain the differ- ences found so far, without having to invoke cultural ones. For orangutans, only one long-term study, of the Bornean subspecies at Tanjung Puting (Galdikas 1988), has garnered enough behavioral data to look for evidence of culture. It is lacking, perhaps because of the scarcity of compa- rable information from other populations or, more likely, because it is difficult</page><page sequence="16">316 MCGREW to speak of group-specific effects in a solitary species, for which any clear-cut social unit has yet to be verified (van Schaik &amp; van Hooff 1996). However, some within-species differences exist: Sumatran orangutans at Suaq Balimb- ing habitually use probes to get insect prey and scrapers to process fruit (van Schaik et al 1996). These resources are present at other study sites, but even studies of much longer duration (Fox et al 1998, Galdikas 1982) have never re- corded any such regular use of tools. This contrasts notably with results from formerly captive orangutans being rehabilitated back to the wild (Russon &amp; Galdikas 1993, 1995) and from captive-born cage-living individuals (Lethmate 1982, Tomasello 1996). Reha- bilitants initiated an astonishing range of activities, e.g. starting outboard mo- tors, applying insect repellent, and hammering nails. However, all but 5 of the 32 actions reproduced were human activities, and no single pattern of imitation oc- curred more often than 4 times or was done by more than 3 of the 30 orangutans. In a follow-up analysis, the targets of these 56 cases of imitative learning were almost always humans, mostly primary caregivers. Thus, orangutans are superb imitators as individuals, but no evidence of a collective culture has emerged. Experimental studies of social learning by captive orangutans rarely show positive results of transfer regardless of whether the models are humans or apes (Tomasello 1996), perhaps because the subjects are not motivated to mimic conspecifics to whom they are not attached (Russon &amp; Galdikas 1995). Captive orangutans are superior problem-solvers and can devise technological solutions (Lethmate 1982), but there seem to be no studies of spontaneous so- cial learning from other orangutans, even when living artificially in groups. Gorillas present a unique challenge for cultural primatology (Byrne 1996): Only one field study has been able to record individual, long-term data, and it is of the most aberrant population of the species. The mountain gorillas of the Virunga Volcanoes of Rwanda, as studied by Fossey and her colleagues at the Karisoke Research Centre, are a tiny, relict population isolated at high eleva- tion (Watts 1984). Their alpine existence is as ecologically representative of the 99% of other gorillas who live in lowland forests, as Tibetans are of Homo sapiens. Thus, western lowland gorillas are primarily fruit-eaters, while moun- tain gorillas are foliage-eaters, and eastern lowland gorillas (who are interme- diate both geographically and altitudinally) fall in between (Watts 1996). This inverse correlation between extent of frugivory and altitude is further exem- plified on a smaller scale by comparison of two populations of eastern lowland gorillas in the same national park (Yamagiwa et al 1996). The Itebero gorillas at 600-1300 m ate more fruit and less bark than did their Kahuzi counterparts at 1800-3300 m. However striking the differences in diet across or within populations, all could be explained by ecological factors, such as differential abundance or relative value of prey species. Within the Virungas population, but across groups, minor differences in diet exist, but all of these can be ac-</page><page sequence="17">CULTURE IN NONHUMAN PRIMATES? 317 counted for by differential abundance of vegetation (Watts 1984). Social learning need not be implicated if individual learning will suffice. The best evidence for cultural differences in western lowland gorillas comes from two wild populations, Lop and Belinga, which are 250 km apart in Gabon (Tutin &amp; Fernandez 1992). Weaver ants (Oecophylla spp.) and small, fungus-farming termites (Cubitermes spp.) are common at both sites, yet Lop gorillas eat the latter but not the former, and Belinga gorillas vice versa. The best data on the details of behavioral ontogeny come from the Virungas: Pat- terns of diversity in the components of processing plant foods suggest that all individual variation can be accounted for by trial-and-error exploration (Byrne &amp; Byrne 1993). There are no mountain gorillas in captivity, and few gorillas of any kind in laboratories, so research on cultural processes must depend on uncontrolled observations in zoos. Most zoo groups of gorillas are small by wild standards, but when larger groups are allowed to form and persist, spontaneous group norms may emerge if the context is helpful: Wood (1984) reported that gorillas at Howletts typically used sticks to rake in food from outside their enclosure. In summary, the relatively impoverished ethnography of great apes is probably less a matter of their limitations and more a matter of data as yet un- collected, except for the solitary orangutan. Close-up behavioral data from multiple groups of identified individuals over generations are eagerly awaited from bonobos and lowland gorillas. Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) The ethnography of chimpanzees is voluminous: In addition to published data from over 35 wild populations across sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal to Uganda (e.g. Tutin et al 1995), there are long-term studies from zoos (e.g. Takeshita &amp; van Hooff 1996) and laboratories (e.g. Tomasello et al 1987). However, apart from material culture, which leaves behind artifacts, the number of wild populations for which behavioral data are suitable for testing Kroeber's criteria are few: Bossou in Guinea (Sugiyama 1997, Matsuzawa 1994), Gombe in Tanzania (Goodall 1986), Kibale in Uganda (Wrangham et al 1994a), Mahale in Tanzania (Nishida 1990), and Tai in Ivory Coast (Boesch &amp; Boesch 1989). This is a function of sustained research and longevity; wild chimpanzee birth intervals and maturation rates are as comparably prolonged as in humans. The material culture of chimpanzees is ubiquitous and diverse. All popula- tions subject to long-term study have proven to be tool makers and users (McGrew 1992). Each chimpanzee population has its own customary tool kit, made mostly from vegetation, that functions in subsistence, defense, self- maintenance, and social relations (Boesch &amp; Boesch 1990, 1993; Sugiyama 1993). Many have tool sets, in which two or more different tools are used as</page><page sequence="18">318 MCGREW composites to solve a problem (Brewer &amp; McGrew 1990, Sugiyama 1997). The same raw material serves multiple functions: A leaf may be a drinking ves- sel, napkin, fishing probe, grooming stimulator, courtship signaler, or medica- tion (Huffman 1997). Conversely, a termite fishing probe may be made of bark, stem, twig, vine, or the midrib of a leaf. An archaeologist would have no difficulty classifying the cross-cultural data in typological terms, based on arti- facts alone; for example, only the far western subspecies, P. troglodytes veuts, uses stone hammers and anvils to crack nuts (Boesch et al 1994, Kortlandt 1986, McGrew et al 1997). Given this ethnographic record, it is difficult to dif- ferentiate, based on material culture, living chimpanzees from earliest Honio (Wynn &amp; McGrew 1989) or even from the simplest living human foragers (McGrew 1987). Behavioral data add flesh to the skeleton of artifacts. For example, army ants (Dotylus spp.) co-occur with chimpanzees at all five major sites. At Gombe, the apes use a two-handed technique involving a long, straight, smooth stick: One hand holds the tool in a power grip while the other hand skillfully sweeps its length in a precision grip, collecting the ants (McGrew 1974). At Bossou and Tai, the chimpanzees also use tools, but in a one-handed technique in which a short probe is put directly to the mouth and the ants re- moved with the teeth (Boesch &amp; Boesch 1990, Sugiyama 1995, Sugiyama et al 1988). At Kibale and Mahale, the ants are ignored by the chimpanzees and never eaten, although at Mahale the apes daily use another type of tool to ob- tain another type of ant (Camponotuts spp.) (Nishida 1973, Nishida &amp; Hiraiwa 1982). How to account for these interpopulational differences, when both prey and raw materials are plentiful? It may be, in optimal foraging theory terms, that the chimpanzees of Kibale and Mahale have better things to do with their time and so have no need to eat army ants. Thus, the difference can be ex- plained in an ecologically deterministic way. But when techniques differ across groups, it is hard to avoid a cultural interpretation, all other relevant things being equal. Sometimes the clues to culture are in the nuances of a universal habit (Ue- hara 1997). Whenever P. troglodytes is sympatric with Colobus badius, the red colobus monkey, the latter is the preferred prey for the chimpanzee predator (Boesch 1994a). At all studied sites, the meat is avidly sought and shared (Stanford 1998). Differences across sites in the degree to which the hunt is co- operative, or even just social as opposed to solitary, may lie in habitat vari- ables, such as forest structure (Boesch 1994b), but other differences may have social causes. Why else do Gombe chimpanzees prefer to eat red colobus in- fants, while Tai's apes take all age-classes? Why else do Tai's chimpanzees consume the brain first, while Gombe's chimpanzees prefer to start with the limbs (Boesch &amp; Boesch 1989)? Such habits appear to be conventional, not just coincidental uniformity over a set of individuals.</page><page sequence="19">CULTURE IN NONHUMAN PRIMATES? 319 Materialists may be satisfied with such ecologically grounded evidence, but social behavior that transcends subsistence factors is more convincing: Grooming is the glue of primate societies, however humbly based in hygiene (Dunbar 1996). Monkeys and apes groom selectively, even politically, in that its patterning is explicable in terms of social variables such as status, alliance, and kinship. Given its intimacy and reciprocity, social grooming has been lik- ened to conversation, and chimpanzees devote hours per day to this normative activity (Goodall 1986). The chimpanzee lives to groom, as well as grooms to live. Because the functional morphology (e.g. thumb and forefinger opposition) of removing parasites or detritus from another's hairy body surface is straight- forward, any standardized but apparently nonfunctional variations on the basic theme are likely to be social customs. Both Gombe and Mahale chimpanzees live in similar habitats, i.e. the mosaic forests along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, and the motor patterns of their functional grooming look indistin- guishable. However, the Mahale apes have added two striking elaborations on the species-typical activity: the grooming hand clasp and the social scratch. The hand clasp is a symmetrical postural configuration in which two par- ticipants sit facing one another and engage in mutual grooming (McGrew &amp; Tutin 1978; Figure 2). Each extends one arm (either both right or both left) overhead, and they clasp hands; meanwhile the other hand grooms the exposed torso of the other. The hand clasp occurs daily at Mahale but has never been seen in more than 35 years of observation at Gombe. It also is customary at Ki- bale and Tai but not at Bossou (Boesch &amp; Tomasello 1998). At Kibale, it is common both in the Kanyawara community and in the Ngogo community (Watts, personal communication). Interestingly, the pattern has now emerged in a captive group at Yerkes, where it is spreading from its first performance by a captive-born adult female (de Waal &amp; Seres 1997). The social scratch is a self-maintenance pattern redeployed to social groom- ing (Nakamura et al 1998). Chimpanzees rake the tips of their partly flexed fin- gers in to-and-fro strokes over their own limbs and trunk in a stereotyped way that is common in all populations. Thus, all individuals are adept at the motor pattern, but only at Mahale has it been seen to be directed to others, inter- spersed with normal grooming components. If we see such differences in body language between groups in Homo sapiens, they are assumed to be cultural. Most mammals, including primates, are thought to be poor relations to birds when it comes to vocal learning, but new findings question this (Janik &amp; Slater 1997, Snowdon &amp; Hausberger 1997, Mitani 1996). For wild chimpanzees, dia- lect differences exist in the long calls (pant-hoots) of the Gombe and Mahale populations; these are quantifiable acoustic features that distinguish the two sets of males (Mitani et al 1992). The means by which communities come to sound alike is joint participation in choruses (Mitani &amp; Brandt 1994).

Diffusion is hard to study because communities are xenophobic and territorial; only females transfer groups, while males are philopatric (Goodall 1986). Thus to follow the diffu- sion of a habit means being able to monitor the emigration of known females into strange groups or the immigration of strange females into known groups (Boesch 1993). Both are difficult but yield valuable data (Hannah &amp; McGrew 1987, Matsuzawa &amp; Yamakoshi 1996). The virtues of patience are reinforced when an entirely new habit is discovered: leafy twigs used as sandals and cush- ions (Alp 1997); "brushsticks" to extract ants (Sugiyama 1985); pestles to pul- verize the hearts of palms (Yamakoshi &amp; Sugiyama 1995). The extent and vol- ume of ethnographic data on P. troglodytes that continue to accumulate call for the serious consideration of establishing a CRAF (Chimpanzee Relations Area File) (Wrangham et al 1994a). HUMAN VERSUS NONHUMAN CULTURE Some skeptics of the existence of nonhuman culture pose explicit, testable hy- potheses about features missing in other species: Tomasello et al (1993a) postu- lated that only human culture shows (a) traditions learned by all group members, (b) skillful techniques similarly acquired by adults and youngsters, and (c) ac- cumulation of modifications over generations. Thus, they recognized habits, but not customs. All hypotheses are readily falsified. All weaned individuals of the Kasakela community of chimpanzees at Gombe use tools to fish for ter- mites (McGrew 1992). Byrne (1995) has shown in elegant detail how young mountain gorillas learn the plant food-processing skills of their elders. As cited above, Japanese monkeys at Koshima have elaborated over decades their subsistence techniques in a ratcheted way (Kawai et al 1992, Watanabe 1994). A less direct form of query is to link culture to another phenomenon or premise. Washburn &amp; Benedict (1979) ruled out nonhuman culture a priori on the grounds that nonhumans lacked language and language was essential to culture. Both premises are debatable propositions, but more exasperatingly, their acceptance precludes any further discussion. Relethford (1997) asserts that while nonhumans use tools, only humans depend on tools. All human cul- tures use tools, but so do all chimpanzee cultures; ipso facto, both are equally dependent, and so not distinguishable on this criteria. More substantial is the debate, especially among psychologists, on whether certain cognitive capacities with cultural implications are uniquely human (Galef 1992; Heyes 1993; Tomasello 1990, 1994). If such capacities, e.g. imi- tation, are taken as necessary conditions for culture, and if these are absent in nonhuman species, then the debate is over (see Figure 1). If performances that were previously interpreted as imitative can be more parsimoniously ex-</page><page sequence="22">322 MCGREW plained by lower-order mimetic processes, such as stimulus enhancement, or even mere mimicry, then (goes the argument) culture can be denied (Galef 1992; Tomasello 1994, 1996). Things get especially sticky if in practice the controlled conditions for proving the existence of imitation can never be met outside the laboratory. And if the impoverished and artificial conditions of captivity (e.g. Call &amp; Tomasello 1995) handicap the subjects so as to produce false-negative results, then culture is effectively precluded. However, more re- cent findings show chimpanzees to be capable of imitation even in the unnatu- ral conditions of confinement (Custance et al 1995, Whiten et al 1996). More fundamental are the objections that neither imitation nor even social learning is a necessary or sufficient condition for culture (Heyes 1993). The crux with regard to mechanisms is that information transmission among individuals is accomplished, however that occurs (King 1994). A more beguiling candidate for human uniqueness in cultural transmission is teaching, that is, intentional and directed transmission of information from a knowledgeable individual to a naive one (see Caro &amp; Hauser 1992 for a lengthy but comprehensive operational definition). The evidence for teaching in nonhuman primates ranges from the anecdotal, e.g. Boesch's (1991) obser- vations of Tai chimpanzee mothers and infants with nut cracking, to the sys- tematic, e.g. Maestripieri's (1996) study of pigtail macaque (Macaca neme- strina) mothers tutoring their infants' locomotion. Whatever the vexing issues of proving intentionality (Maestripieri 1995) or not (Caro &amp; Hauser 1992), the fact remains that much of human cultural transmission does not involve tui- tion; for example, of 50 skills of daily life acquired by Aka pygmies, most were learned by watching or by doing, not be being taught (Hewlett &amp; Cavalli- Sforza 1986). Therefore, teaching is not a necessary condition for culture, al- though it may be a sufficient one. In conclusion, primate culture in the broad sense seems likely to be a stem trait dating back at least to the last common anthropoid ancestor. As such, it predates all the derived traits of hominization, that is, bipedalism, enlarged and lateralized cerebral cortex, lithic technology, symbol use, and so on. To para- phrase Gertrude Stein, culture is culture is culture, in a variety of species, if culture is taken to be group-specific behavior that is at least partly acquired from social influences (see above). At the same time, human culture does not equal chimpanzee culture does not equal Japanese monkey culture. Each spe- cies is unique, but as more and more data accumulate, cross-species differ- ences look more to be ones of degree, not kind. In a stricter sense, the uniqueness of human culture depends on what is hu- man. Even if, for example, externally stored knowledge in the form of sym- bolic depiction, whether as cave art or cuneiforms, is unique to modern Homo sapiens, we still must explain enculturated apes (Toth et al 1993, Tomasello et al 1993b, Tomasello 1996). That is, we must account for the admittedly un-</page><page sequence="23">CULTURE IN NONHUMAN PRIMATES? 323 natural and contrived acts of other species in labs using joysticks to move cur- sors or to tap out messages on keyboards. Whether or not these are performing beasts or fellow culture-bearers requires further study and so justifies the exis- tence of such a field as cultural primatology. But a discipline requires subjects, and most species of nonhuman primate are endangered by their human cous- ins. Ultimately, whatever its merit, cultural primatology must be committed to cultural survival.
