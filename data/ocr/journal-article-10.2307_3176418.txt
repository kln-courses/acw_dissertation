<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gary L. Ebersole THE FUNCTION OF RITUAL WEEPING REVISITED: AFFECTIVE EXPRESSION AND MORAL DISCOURSE Laughing and crying have long been held in the West to be uniquely hu- man acts. Human beings laugh and shed tears, we are told, while animals do not.1 This claim has shown a remarkable durability, surviving, even flourishing, over the centuries despite major shifts in the understanding of theology, epistemology, and human and animal physiology. In the modem scientific world, the assertion that only humans weep and laugh has gone largely unchallenged, with the notable exception of Charles Darwin's The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals.2 Anthropologists and 1 A few examples of the myriad instances repeating this "universal truism" must suffice. "Throughout the history of humankind, tears have been intertwined with the very essence of the human heart, for the ability to shed emotional tears-psychogenic lacrimation- seems to be one of the few physiological processes which separates humans from other an- imals" (William H. Frey II, with Muriel Langseth, Crying: The Mystery of Tears [Minne- apolis: Winston Press, 1985], p. 4). In her foreword to Helmuth Plessner's phenomenological study, Laughing and Crying: A Study of the Limits of Human Behavior (Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, 1970), Marjorie Grene writes, "Laughing and crying are not 'intentional' actions, like speaking, walking, or tacitly giving a sign, say, nodding one's head or smiling in assent. They belong ... to the Aristotelian class of 'involuntary actions.' Yet neither are they the sort of things that other animals do; only human beings laugh and cry" (p. xi). Later Grene refers to "that strange pair of human monopolies, laughter and tears" (p. xiii). Note that she ignores ritual weeping, which would clearly qualify as an in- tentional action. On laughter, a historian of religions has recently asserted that "laughter is a universal human expression, restricted to humans and therefore understood as a dividing line between humankind and animals" (Ingvild Saelid Gilhus, Laughing Gods, Weeping Vir- gins: Laughter in the History of Religions [London and New York: Routledge, 1997], p. 2). 2 Charles Darwin, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (London: Mur- ray, 1872). A recent work, which argues that animals experience emotions much as humans do, is Jeffrey Masson, When Elephants Weep: The Emotional Lives of Animals (New York: ? 2000 by The University of Chicago.

While a few anthropological studies of ritual weeping in individual cultures exist, no broad comparative study has been produced.5 The situation in the history of religions is even more disappointing. It is telling that the few pages James G. Frazer devoted to an eclectic set of reports of ritual weeping, which remained in his hands uninterpreted, still served as the basis for the brief uninformative entry on "Tears" in Macmillan's The Encyclopedia of Religion.6 In this essay, I will argue for the importance of the study of tears for the history of religions.

Masson's work is driven by a strong animal rights agenda, while the evidence produced to justify his claims is largely anecdotal in nature. A much better study is Donald R. Griffin, Animal Minds (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992). 3 An exception is Gilhus's Laughing Gods, Weeping Virgins. Despite the title, weeping is not really treated. 4 The phrase "the history of tears" has been used by literary historians such as Anne Vincent-Buffault, The History of Tears: Sensibility and Sentimentality in France (London: Macmillan, 1991); Sheila Page Bayne, Tears and Weeping: An Aspect of Emotional Cli- mate Reflected in Seventeenth-Century French Literature (Tubigen: G. Narr; Paris: Edutu- ibs Jean-Michel Place, 1981), and Fred Kaplan, Sacred Tears: Sentimentality in Victorian Literature (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1987). While scholars of European and American literature from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries have produced some excellent studies, no one has undertaken a history of tears along the lines of Philippe Aries's studies of death, childhood, or privacy in the West. For examples of Aries's work, see Centuries of Childhood: A Social History of Family Life (New York: Knopf, 1962), A History of Private Life, ed. Philippe Aries and Georges Duby, 4 vols.

While all healthy persons have the ability to shed tears, the "meaning" attributed to specific tears depends on a number of situational elements and on specific sociocultural expecta- tions. In order to understand the functions and meanings of tears, his- torians of religions must concern themselves with the diverse religious anthropologies found around the world, myths and folktales involving crying, and the historical, ethnographic, and artistic records of ritual weep- ing. Instances of ritualized weeping, however, should not be studied in isolation from the religious anthropology of a people, social and political structures, the prevailing value system(s) of the actors, or the local con- structions of class and gender. Tears-whether actually shed or withheld, or as they are represented performatively, pictorially, or narratively-must be understood in terms of the local sociocultural "feeling rules," moral values, and the aesthetics and politics of affective display.7 We must, then, concern ourselves with the cultural poetics of ritual and ritualized weeping. At the same time, we must resist the temptation to judge all tears in terms of their immediate association with "real" emotions. James G. Frazer, for instance, assumed that every instance of ritual weeping-as-greeting re- ported among "primitives" was "a simple formality attended with hardly more emotion than our custom of shaking hands or raising the hat."8 In- terpretations such as this, which are all too common, assume that when a formal setting or social script requires a person to cry, the tears shed in such contexts are less than "real" precisely because they are not a spon- taneous emotional response. As historians, we need to recognize that this evaluation of tears is based in part on the Western bourgeois sense of the individual; it is not a universal, normative distinction.9 By universalizing this distinction between real and false tears, such interpretations prema- turely foreclose any serious inquiry into either the local discourse about tears or the multiple ways in which specifically (and differently) situated social agents at times strategically manipulate the local sociocultural un- derstanding of tears for their own intents and purposes. In order to understand the meaning of specific tears, including those shed in religious ritual contexts, the tears must be considered in association with the broader social discourses in which they participate as affective displays, including discourses of social hierarchy, power, gender, class, race, and morality. Thus, the object of study for historians of religions is 7 On "feeling rules," see Arlie R. Hochschild, "Emotion Work, Feeling Rules, and So- cial Structure," American Journal of Sociology 85 (1979): 551-75, and The Managed Heart: The Commercialization of Human Feeling (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1983). 8 Folk-Lore in the Old Testament, abridged ed., p. 238. 9 For a trenchant critique of the essentialist position on emotion, see Catherine A. Lutz, Unnatural Emotions: Everyday Sentiments on a Micronesian Atoll and Their Challenge to Western Theory (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988). 213</page><page sequence="4">Ritual Weeping not only ritual weeping practices per se, but also the discursive activity in the form of praise, criticism, parody, and so on that takes place around tears more generally. It is not the role of the historian of religions to judge tears to be real or fake; rather, we must pay careful attention to how and why situated individuals cry. In writing the history of tears, another important goal must be to analyze, whenever possible, the process of the discursive "naturalization" of tears and the subsequent internalization of the asso- ciated social values and feeling rules, which as a whole produces seem- ingly spontaneous tears in specific situations. We must also investigate the symbolic fields within which cultural capital can be earned by situated per- sons shedding or, alternatively, not shedding tears. Finally, we need to take careful note of the transgressive potential of tears and the ways in which tears frequently participate in moral discourse. The historian of religions is not interested in all tears, however. The tears produced when dicing an onion, for example, are not of concern because they are a purely physiological response to irritation of the cornea. Our focus must be on "performative" tears (those shed in rituals proper or in ritualized social situations that perform cultural work),10 as well as on the discursive activity that takes place around tears-as-signs. Such tears serve a variety of social purposes, including marking out social and hierarchical relationships at times, dissolving them at others, inviting or demanding specific social relationships, or marking/protesting the abrogation of social and moral contracts. Crossing the inside/outside boundary of the physical body, tears are available to persons as, to borrow Mary Douglas's term, a seemingly natural symbol of the individual in society. As such, tears have often been found to be an effective means of locating (and, possibly, ad- vancing) one's "self" in society, as well as a potentially powerful vehicle of social, political, and moral commentary and critique. BLURRED VISION AND TEARS IN THE HISTORY OF RELIGIONS If tears represent something of a blind spot in the history of religions, this situation is due in part to the distortions in our vision introduced by the unexamined dual assumptions that only human beings shed tears and that "real" tears are spontaneous emotional responses. These assumptions carry internal contradictions generated by the conjunction of bourgeois individ- ualism and Enlightenment universalism. To claim that real tears are a spontaneous emotional response to some event leads to the position that 10 I use "ritualized" to include not only social and religious ritual proper, but also the more mundane forms of patterned social interaction that are informed by cultural values. The phrase "cultural work" is borrowed and adapted from the work of Jane Tomkins, Sen- sational Designs: The Cultural Work of American Fiction, 1790-1860 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985). 214</page><page sequence="5">History of Religions insofar as ritual tears are "scripted," they are by definition mere formali- ties, not real tears. But saying this does not so much explain ritual tears as it explains them away. We need to take seriously the fact that people in many other cultures and times have not shared our assumptions about emo- tions, tears, or the similarities and differences between animals and hu- mans. To cite but one example, when the Toloi, a people from Papua New Guinea, discuss the differences between humans and animals, they do not point either to the ability to shed tears or to the emotions as critical mark- ers of difference. Rather, to the Toloi, it is obvious that a dog experiences emotions such as anger, just as humans do.11 The crucial difference be- tween dogs and human beings, they say, is that, unlike humans, a dog does not recognize right and wrong, for it lacks the ability to reflect on the moral status of its own actions. For the Toloi, the fact that a dog will copulate with its own mother without shame is clear proof of this.12 Carrying into our studies the assumption that only humans shed tears has led to a number of distortions of the historical record available to us. Needless to say, cultures parse the differences between human nature and the natures of nonhumans in diverse ways. Many myths and tales from around the world tell of animals, gods, demons, and other nonhumans weeping. What are we to make of these? If we uncritically take our pars- ing of human nature to be normative and universal, then the very myths and tales through which other people have posed and explored questions surrounding human and nonhuman nature are perforce dismissed as being little more than the products of anthropomorphic projections, uncon- scious fantasies of some sort, or the creations of a primitive mentality. A few of the problems that we have unnecessarily created for ourselves by clinging to the "obvious fact" that only humans shed tears may be il- lustrated by a close analysis of a recent scholarly (mis)reading of a Japa- nese religious tale. In an influential study of Buddhism and the literary arts in medieval Japan, William LaFleur introduces the following tale from the Nihon ryoiki, a ninth-century collection of wondrous events: In Kawachi province there was once a melon merchant whose name was Isowake. He would load huge burdens on his horse, far in excess of what it could carry. Then, if it would not move, he would get furious and drive it on by whipping it. The horse would then move along with its burden, but tears would I Due to the constraints of space, I am bracketing here the issue of the differences in the cultural definitions of emotions such as shame, as well as the issue of differences in their forms of expression. Thus, the issues of "translation" are not addressed. 12 A. L. Epstein, In the Midst of Life: Affect and Ideation in the World of the Tolai (Berke- ley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1992), p. 63. A dog expresses a sense of shame only after it has been chastised by a human. In this, a dog is like a human child who must be taught such emotional responses. For instance, when a child has done some- thing inappropriate, he is often told, "you should be ashamed [embarrassed]." 215</page><page sequence="6">Ritual Weeping be falling from its two eyes. When the man had sold all his melons, he would kill the horse. He, in fact, killed a good number of horses this way. Later, how- ever, this fellow Isowake happened to be just looking down into a kettle of boiling water one day when his own two eyes fell out of his head and were boiled in the kettle. Manifest retribution comes quickly. We ought to believe in karmic causality. Even though we look upon animals as mere beasts, they were our parents in some past life. In fact, it is passage through the six courses and according to the four modes of birth that constitutes our real family. Therefore, it will not do to be merciless.13 LaFleur proceeds to interpret this tale as follows: This account is quite obviously based on a local legend that had probably gained credence through many retellings and become widely accepted as fact.... With this story Ky6kai [the compiler/editor and a Buddhist priest] explains a double anomaly. He not only provides an explanation to people who may have wondered what lay behind the extant tale of a man whose eyes fell out (how- ever embellished and far-fetched the original event may have become) but he also explains a much more common but still anomalous phenomenon, namely, that of animals whose eyes ooze with water. Kyokai's contemporaries would have known well that one of the perceptible differences between man and animal is that beings in the latter category do not weep; pain or emotional distress brings no tears to their eyes. Nevertheless, there are exceptions, animals with eyes that water for reasons we would today describe as medical. Ky6kai's explana- tion for such phenomena was, of course, not medical but in terms of karma and transmigration. For him, the weeping horse is a clear instance of residual activ- ity from a former incarnation, that is, of the earlier human who is in some sense still "in" the horse making his presence known.14 No one, to my knowledge, has challenged LaFleur's reading of this tale. Indeed, at first glance, it seems to be a masterful exercise in logical argument and good sense. Yet, there are a number of peculiarities in this exegesis that bear our attention. First, it is odd that LaFleur, a longtime student of Japanese literature, does not really treat the folktale as a folk- tale (i.e., as a narrative artifact in its own right). The text he has extracted from the Nihon ryoiki consists of the tale proper and the commentary by Kyokai, which begins with "Manifest retribution comes quickly." In elid- ing the distinction between these in his own metacommentary, LaFleur never acknowledges that the folktale had (and has) its own narrative in- 13 This translation is LaFleur's from The Karma of Words: Buddhism and the Literary Arts in Medieval Japan (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1983), pp. 36-37.

What meaning, one must ask, did the horse's tears have within this narrative when it cir- culated orally prior to Kyokai's retelling, which in turn gave it a new and specifically Buddhist interpretation? LaFleur notes in passing the structural parallelism ("coincidence" in his terms) between the tears falling from the horse's eyes and the eyes of the melon merchant falling out, but he never broaches the issue of the possible significance of this structural element within the tale itself. In- stead, he implies that in Kyokai's hands this coincidence was transformed from little more than a thematic and poetic (fanciful?) element into a powerful illustration of the workings of karma. Yet, careful attention to the folktale discloses that the parallelism therein does not require the addition of a Buddhist interpretation in order to make it meaningful. Specifically, the presence of the narrative element of the abused horse shedding tears, coupled with the man who shows no signs of compassion as he works his animals to death, already raises such moral issues as bru- tal exploitation, gratuitous violence, greed, and the dehumanizing poten- tial of the marketplace. Let us suppose for a moment that, like the Toloi, the early Japanese took the ability to recognize right and wrong, rather than the mere ability to shed tears, to be the true mark of human nature. In that case, the pres- ence or absence of tears in a morally inflected situation would first and foremost signal a character's moral status rather than whether he belonged to the ontological category of "human" or "animal." As an alternative to LaFleur's reading, I want to suggest that the tears in the folktale proper mark or point to a serious violation of a moral contract, here between the human owner and a beast of burden. More generally, they tell of the fail- ure of the superior party in a hierarchical power relationship to fulfill his side of a reciprocal economic and moral contract. Like human laborers, the horse worked for his master with the expectation of receiving reward and sustenance in return. The folktale makes it clear, however, that the melon merchant brutally drove his horses beyond their limits of endur- ance. In this situation, the detail of Isowaki's eyes falling out signals his moral blindness and, consequently, his inhumane nature. Careful attention to other narrative details in this deceptively simple tale will disclose even more meaning. For example, although ignored by LaFleur, the seemingly minor details that Isowake is a melon merchant (uri-hisa) and that the weeping animal is a horse, rather than some other animal, are highly significant. In Japanese, a classical oval human face, considered the most beautiful, is called urizanegao, literally "a true melon face,"15 while an extremely long face, which departs from the aesthetic 15 Japanese melons are oval in shape, not elongated like the common watermelons in the United States. An alternative compound noun urizanegao is written using a different middle 217</page><page sequence="8">Ritual Weeping ideal, is called umagao or umazura, "a horse face." Moreover, in the Jap- anese symbolic and linguistic universe, the valences of "horse" are largely negative.16 For instance, a fool or dunce is bakamono (the Chinese char- acters read "horse-deer person"), while simpleminded credulity or naive honesty is baka-shojiki ("horse-deer honesty").17 Thus, the precise narrative elements juxtaposed in the tale-Isowaki is a melon merchant and a horse sheds tears-suggest that much more is going on here than La Fleur implies. A simple structural analysis will dis- close the symbolic inversions at play. A melon is both like and unlike an ideal human face and head. A melon is like a human face in shape and like a human head in that it contains water (and tears). A melon is unlike a human face/head, though, in not having any apertures such as eyes, from which the liquid might emerge. In contrast, a horse's head is like a human's in having eyes, nostrils, and so on, but it is (usually) unlike it in shape. If one now returns, with these bits of knowledge in hand, to this "sim- ple" folktale, it will be found to be much richer and more complex, even without Ky6kai's Buddhist commentary, than LaFleur intimates. Remark- ably compact, without sacrificing symbolic depth or complexity, this folk- tale has been carefully crafted by invoking, among other things, cultural associations to and values drawn among facial shapes, horses, melons, and tears in order to reflect on human nature and morality. The structural inversion-tears fall from the eyes of a horse and tearless eyes fall out of the melon merchant's head into a container of a hot liquid-constitutes a fairly sophisticated reflection on human nature. The implication is clear that a moral human nature is not something that is given or inherent in any body; it is achieved by being enacted. That is, the tale suggests that true humanity is realized only through moral interactions with other beings, human and nonhuman. The melon merchant's loss of his eyes signals that human nature can also be forfeited through immoral actions. Without eyes, the merchant's face is in a superficial sense even more like a melon, but, at the same time, this face, which can shed no tears, reveals his real nature (expressed through his actions) to be far from the human moral ideal. In contrast, while the superficial form of the horse's face departs from the human ideal of beauty, its nature as a hardworking creature of simpleminded and uncalculating Chinese character, which means "seed [of a fruit]," yielding the literal reading "melon seed-[shaped] face." 16 A glance at any Japanese dictionary will disclose that almost all compound words or phrases incorporating the character for "horse" have a negative valence and imply stupidity, dimwittedness, silliness, excessive credulity, and obstinacy (which, interestingly enough, we would call "pigheadedness." 17 Interestingly, in George Orwell's twentieth-century novel Animal Farm, a horse figures as the prime example of a simpleminded, good-hearted, gullible, and brutally ex- ploited laborer. 218</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions honesty transforms the tears it sheds into a powerful moral critique of the inhumane treatment it has received. The crucial issue in this tale for the early Japanese, then, was never whether animals really weep or not, as LaFleur suggests. Rather, it was what a proper moral economy would be like, and what, within hierarchical labor relationships, constitutes humane and inhumane treatment. The anomaly being addressed is not that a horse has shed tears; it is the moral aberration that laborers (animal and human) are mistreated by those with power over them. This is not the only way in which the tale-as-a-tale and its narrative representation of tears get short shrift. LaFleur is led into an impossibly convoluted argument precisely because he clings to the unexamined and culturally parochial assumption that it is obvious that only humans shed tears because "pain or emotional distress brings no tears" to the eyes of animals. It is LaFleur's explicit linkage of the shedding of tears with pain and emotions that ultimately drives him to parse the "real" and the fictional in this tale and, thus, in effect, to "correct" the original. On the one hand, he denies that the tale-as-told in the ninth century, with weep- ing horses and a man's eyes falling out, had a real historical referent, as Kyokai claims it did ("The account is quite obviously based on a local legend"). At the same time, he assumes, without providing any hard evidence for this position, that the legend itself must have been based on an unspecified "original event," which had long since been narratively "embellished" into its current "far-fetched" and incredible form. On the other hand, LaFleur asserts that the putative tears shed by the horse(s) no doubt had a real referent (animals' eyes sometimes "water for reasons we would today describe as medical"), which somehow (he never explains how or why this occurred) had subsequently been misrecognized by the early Japanese and mislabeled as "tears." In LaFleur's metacommentary, Kyokai is presented as having brought a rational explanation to this "double anomaly" (i.e., an anomaly first in the real world and again in the tale) by imposing on it the Buddhist interpretive frame of karmic causality and the ontological taxonomy of rokudo, the six courses of the chain of being. He stresses that while Kyokai's interpretive framework is different from our modern one, it is internally rational and consistent and thus carries its own explanatory power. With the addition of karma and rebirth to the textual mix, LaFleur finds it acceptable (rational) to speak of a horse crying tears because the horse now retains a (partial) human nature ("the weeping horse is a clear instance of residual [karmic] activity... of the earlier human who is in some sense still 'in' the horse"). Not only that, he assumes that the early Japanese themselves must have also recognized the rational, explanatory power of the Buddhist worldview, which now, for the first time, made sense of the anomaly of water oozing from an animal's eyes. Implicit, of course, is the further 219</page><page sequence="10">Ritual Weeping assumption that the modern scientific worldview, with its definitive "med- ical reasons" for this oddity, is even more rational. The contortions and distortions in LaFleur's reading are, I suggest, symptomatic of the obfuscating power that the dual assumptions concern- ing tears, noted earlier, continue to exercise over us. In good Enlighten- ment fashion, LaFleur assumes that we share a common human nature and rationality with the early Japanese, who perforce must have perceived the world and reality just as we do. In his eyes, this assumption justifies the conclusion that, just like us, the early Japanese "would have known well that one of the perceptible differences between man and animal" was that members of the latter category did not weep (emphasis added). Yet, he does not (and, perhaps, cannot) explain how and why, even as the early Japanese recognized the "fact" that only humans weep, they nevertheless misrecognized water oozing from animals' eyes as emotional tears. It will be worth our while to pause in order to reflect further on whose vision is blurred here and why. Even if we grant LaFleur's argument that in early medieval Japan ani- mals' eyes sometimes watered for medical reasons (as they surely must have), more often than not this condition would undoubtedly have been witnessed by the Japanese in situations where neither emotional stress nor physical pain had been inflicted on the animals. Are we to suppose that in all of these cases, too, the Japanese would have taken such watery eyes to be emotional tears? There is, as far as I know, no historical evidence for an affirmative answer to this question. Why, then, is LaFleur apparently willing to live with the awkward situation of simultaneously claiming that the early Japanese were rational like us and that they could still be befud- dled en masse by the watery eyes of animals? The answer, in part, lies in his desire to prove his central thesis that "Buddhism gained ascendancy in medieval Japan largely because it successfully put forward a coherent explanation of the world and of human experience; it was the single most satisfying and comprehensive explanation available to the Japanese people at the time."18 Two important points emerge from scrutinizing this statement. First, the implication is unmistakable that the pre-Buddhist worldview was incoher- ent at certain (unspecified, but critical) points and incapable of explaining certain aspects of "human experience." According to LaFleur, the logic of the theories of karmic retribution and rokudo dispelled any sense of the uncanny emanating from "anomolies" in the world and cleared up the 18 La Fleur, p. 26, emphasis added. This sentence, which opens his essay on the Nihon ryoiki, taken in conjunction with LaFleur's statement cited earlier on tears as the obvious "perceptible difference" between humans and animals, suggests some slippage in his under- standing of the relationship of the world, sensory perception, and epistemology. Regrettably, I cannot address this complex issue here. 220</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions blurred vision (of animal "tears," for example) resulting from an inferior epistemology.19 Second, he implies that human experience of the world (including, most especially, the crucial "perceptible difference" between animals and humans, that the former do not shed tears) exists prior to or outside of all culturally constructed worldviews. One suspects that, if pressed on this, LaFleur would deny the broader implication I have drawn here from his words. But, if this is the case, it only increases the interest in the question of why, of all things, it was tears that led him into this muddle. I will return to this question shortly. In the end, the very text LaFleur cites presents intractable problems for him. Not only does the text provide no evidence for the claim that the early Japanese recognized full well that animals do not shed tears, it tells of horses weeping. Moreover, the text does not suggest that these tears were perceived to be anomalous, nor does it register any surprise whatsoever over them. It simply says of the horse, with no emotional inflection, "Tears came out of both eyes" (futatsu no me ni namida o dasu).20 These tears are anomalous, it would seem, in LaFleur's eyes only. Within the narrative world of the folktale, they make perfectly good sense. As a student of Japanese religion and literature, LaFleur is surely familiar with the many other texts from early and medieval Japan in which nonhumans are portrayed shedding tears. To try to explain away each and every such account of gods (kami), buddhas, bodhisattvas, demons, ani- mals, birds, and even fish shedding tears would lead to similar, impossibly convoluted positions. More important, to do so would be to destroy the very documents that can provide insight into the world of meaning of early and medieval Japan. LaFleur's difficulties stem from the anachro- nistic projection of his own commonsense assumptions back in time onto a different people. Marshall Sahlins's point, made recently in relation to a different cultural-historical context, is also pertinent here: "[Western] commonsense bourgeois realism, when taken as a historiographic conceit, is a kind of symbolic violence done to other times and other customs. ... One cannot do good history, not even contemporary history, without regard for ideas, actions, and ontologies that are not and never were our own."21 LaFleur's reading of this tale illustrates an ever-present danger facing historians of religions. We generously want to assume a universal 19 In The Karma of Words, LaFleur does not address the reasons why Mahayana Bud- dhism eventually lost its epistemological hegemony in Japan, but one senses that, were he to do so, he would continue to apply Thomas Kuhn's concept of paradigm shifts.

TEARING THROUGH THE MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE WORLDS IN THE WEST This critique of LaFleur's reading has revealed some of the mental gym- nastics that otherwise good scholars are willing to subject themselves (and readers) to in order to maintain and universalize their "commonsense" view that humans shed tears, while animals do not, because only humans feel emotions. A few examples will demonstrate that this commonsense view has never been as widely held in the West as most people assume. In folktales and myths from around the world, animals and other nonhuman creatures are often portrayed as laughing and weeping. In many different cultures the ontological difference between animals and humans has often been a subject of vigorous debate. One scholar has recently argued, for in- stance, that in Christianity a major shift in understanding concerning this issue occurred in the twelfth century; at this time the earlier ontological paradigm broke down, and it became more difficult to determine what dis- tinguished the categories of animal and human.22 Equally important for the history of religions, many people have believed (and some continue to be- lieve) that human beings could assume animal forms and vice versa.23 The integrity of the human body has also often been felt to be tenuous at best, since many have assumed that it can be invaded, taken over, or possessed by other beings, human and nonhuman. As a result, beings with human forms might actually be other than (or less than) fully human. External form, then, has not always been taken to indicate a being's true nature or identity, nor has the ontological distinction between human and nonhuman always been sharply marked. Two examples must suffice to suggest something of the real historical effects specific assumptions concerning the etiology of tears have had in European history. When corporeal form was deemed insufficient to estab- lish a person's real identity, at times the presence or absence of tears served as conclusive evidence. In Renaissance Europe, for instance, suspected witches and werewolves were often asked to cry as part of a battery of 22 See Joyce E. Salisbury, The Beast Within: Animals in the Middle Ages (New York: Routledge, 1994). 23 One need only think of the texts on metamorphosis from the classical world, but there are also modern reports of humans turning into animals. See, e.g., the report collected in the 1970s in rural Ireland by Henry Glassie, which suggested that a woman transformed herself into a hare in order to steal the milk from a neighbor's cows (Passing the Time in Bally- menone: Culture and History of an Ulster Community [Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1982], p. 536). 222</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions tests. Those who could not produce tears on command were judged to be nonhuman or to be under the control of a demon. Based on this "proof" of identity, numerous individuals were condemned to death.24 In France, "suspicion alone was enough to warrant arrest. Not to shed tears while making a confession, looking at the ground, speaking as if in asides or blaspheming was a sign of a witch."25 Not all observers accepted the reasoning behind this test, yet in L'in- credulite slavante et la credulite ignorante au sujet des Magiciens et des Sorciers (1671) Jacques d'Autun still felt the need to argue against ac- cepting the inability to shed tears as proof that a person was a witch.26 Some physicians, who doubted the existence of the Devil, in arguing for a medical rather than a demonic etiology for the inability to cry, cited the authority of Marcellus of Sidon (second century C.E.). He had diagnosed this inability to be a symptom of a medical condition he labeled lycan- thropia or morbus lupinus.27 For these writers, the absence of tears made one wolf-like, perhaps, but not a wolf. In 1644, however, the philosopher and physician William Drage held that actual physical metamorphosis could and did occur. Many other religious thinkers adopted a middle position, recognizing the apparent existence of werewolves but denying their reality. Augustine wrote: It is very generally believed that by certain witches' spells and the power of the Devil men may be changed into wolves ... but they do not lose their human rea- soning and understanding, nor are their minds made the intelligence of a mere beast. Now this must be understood in this way: namely, that the Devil creates no new nature, but that he is able to make something appear to be which in reality is not. For by no spell nor evil power can the mind, nay, not even the body cor- poreally, be changed into the material limbs and features of any animal ... but a man is fantastically and by illusion metamorphosed into an animal, albeit he to himself seems to be a quadruped.28 24 The literature on witchcraft is too voluminous to cite here.

In the Renaissance, the meaning of tears (or their absence) was highly contested. While an individual's inability to weep could raise questions about her or his identity or ontological nature, excessive weeping could also attract the attention, scrutiny, and displeasure of ecclesiastical authorities. In fifteenth-century England, for example, church officials placed the mys- tical laywoman Margery Kempe under surveillance and conducted various tests in order to determine whether her copious tears were a divine "gift," the result of demonic activity, or simply faked in order to attract attention.29 Kempe gained renown (and, in some cases, ignominy) for her bouts of bois- terous weeping, which could last for hours or even days at a time. In this case, Kempe's human nature was never in question; rather, the nature of her tears was at issue and this was believed to hinge on their causal source. Through her scribe, Margery Kempe recalled how others had sought to explain away her tears: "Some said it was a wicked spirit that vexed her; some said it was a sickness [epilepsy?]; some said she had drunk too much wine."30 On the positive side, appealing to the tradition of tears of compunction going back to the Desert Fathers, some contemporaries in- terpreted Kempe's tears as spiritual signs. Others attributed them to the stirrings of the soul by the Holy Spirit or viewed them as a necessary part of the female meditative practice of imitating the Virgin and Mary Magdalene at the crucifixion. The example of Margery Kempe helps us to appreciate the fact that within a religious context tears sometimes function as clear signs, but at other times their significance is the subject of dispute. What is clear, however, is that the meaning of such tears is always socially negotiated. One might have expected historians of religions to have recognized that within any given culture tears have a social history or, perhaps better, his- tories. Even a preliminary study of the subject will disclose that the meanings attributed to tears change over time, as do the social expectations concerning them (e.g., who can or should shed tears; when, where, why, and how they should be shed; and how long one should weep in specific situations). To be 29 The rediscovery of The Book of Margery Kempe earlier in the twentieth century has provoked a flurry of work on this laywoman. For the work itself, see The Book of Margery Kempe, ed.

None of this should be "news" to historians of religions. Since the work of ltmile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss, most historians of religions have accepted that the human body is culturally and historically con- structed. So, once again we must ask, Why should tears, a bodily product, be considered by many people to be exceptional in this respect? The answer may lie in certain developments in the Renaissance. In Renaissance Europe the ever-growing flood of reports from around the world concerning the diverse religious beliefs, rites, and social customs of different peoples provoked renewed and intense discussion of what con- stituted human nature. Significantly, the subject of tears factored heavily in these discussions, which drew on classical and medieval sources, as well as contemporary accounts. According to one scholar, "among the favorite subjects of discussion by Renaissance writers on the affections were laughter and weeping."31 Building on the work of Norbert Elias, Stephen Greenblatt has noted in passing that in the Renaissance tears came to hold a unique, class-inflected status: "Eventually, all the body's products, except tears, became simply unmentionable in decent society."32 Unfortunately, Greenblatt does not pursue the reasons why tears came to have this unique status, nor does he address the significance of this fact. Below, I will venture a preliminary answer. If Marcel Mauss was the first comparative sociologist to demonstrate that the human body is not merely a physical reality but is also a symbolic ve- hicle carrying cultural meanings, which are constructed and represented through bodily techniques,33 Elias was perhaps the first to reveal the central importance of culturally constructed bodily techniques to the "civilizing process" in the Renaissance.34 As a part of the civilizing process, specific social forces in the Renaissance solidified as "common sense" the two assumptions concerning tears that continue to haunt us: tears mark a fun- damental difference between humans and animals, and "real" tears are spontaneous signs of an internal emotional state. These two assumptions generate two sets of binary oppositions, which can be represented, with their categorical differences, as follows: humans/animals :: shed tears/do not shed tears true tears/false tears :: spontaneous/simulated emotional expression. 31 H.

(New York: Pantheon, 1982). 225</page><page sequence="16">Ritual Weeping As we saw above in our discussion of the tale from the Nihon ryoiki, how- ever, the binary opposition human/animal is not an ironclad dichotomy. Rather, in order to mark out differences within each category, mixed forms are generated, such as a weeping horse and a man who cannot shed tears.35 We should not be surprised, then, to find a third mediating form-an an- imal that sheds tears-in the Renaissance as well. I refer, of course, to the imaginary creature behind the telltale phrase "crocodile tears," a being that bears comparison with the weeping horse in the Nihon ryoiki. Whereas the crocodile sheds tears calculated to mislead others, the horse, being honest to a fault, sheds morally justifiable (i.e., true) tears. In Europe, reports of weeping crocodiles go back to the Middle Ages. One of the most famous is found in a twelfth-century Latin bestiary, which, after presenting a fairly accurate description of a Nile species, pro- ceeds to compare certain human beings with it: "Hypocritical, dissolute and avaricious people have the same nature as this brute-also any people who are puffed up with the vice of pride, dirtied with the corruption of luxury, or haunted with the disease of avarice-even if they do make a show of falling in with the justifications of the Law, pretending in the sight of men to be upright and indeed very saintly."36 The author continues in this vein, associating the crocodile with hypocrisy and dissimulation. The crocodile was purported to move only its upper jaw, while the bottom one remained motionless; this "fact" made it a perfect symbol of dissim- ulation. Mention must also be made of Richard de Fourival's Bestiary of Love, which compared in unflattering ways women and the love of women to a long series of animals, including the crocodile.37 One of the first explicit references to a crocodile shedding hypocritical tears is the report in Mandeville's Travels (ca. 1357-58) of a creature that wept when it killed and ate men.38 Over the centuries, Mandeville's Trav- els circulated widely in various forms and in many different languages, spreading the tale of this calculating animal. Crocodile tears were again attested to in a travel account of the sixteenth-century slave trader and explorer Sir John Hawkins (1532-95), who wrote of a peculiar species of crocodile whose "nature is even when he would have his prey, to cry and sob ... to provoke them to come to him, and then he snatcheth at them." This sort of intertextual borrowing or quotation over the years is typical of medieval and Renaissance textual practices. 35 See Baroja (n. 25 above), pp. 36-37, for a similar argument. 36 T. H. White, trans., The Book of Beasts (London: Jonathan Cape, 1954), p. 50. 37 See Richard de Fournival, Master Richard's Bestiary of Love and Response, trans. Jeanette Beer (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1986). 38 See M. C. Seymour, ed., Mandeville's Travels (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1967), p. 208. The image of a man-eating crocodile shedding tears after consuming a human represents a complete inversion of a second-century report from Aelian that "the people of the City of Apollo ... catch crocodiles in a drag net, and having hung them up on persea-trees, they beat them with many blows and flog them as men are flogged, while the animals whimper and shed tears; then they cut them down and feast on them" (cited in White, trans., p. 159, n. 1). 226</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions How are we to understand these literary and pictorial representations, spanning several centuries, of a weeping animal? Writing of a twelfth- century Bestiary, Jane Salisbury cautions us that "while the work was intended to be a 'scientific' study of animals, it was not scientific in the same way we understand the term. The author was less interested in [accurately] describing an animal than in using the animal as a vehicle for understanding religious truth, the 'science' the author was ultimately study- ing."39 The weeping animals in such works, then, were not (and should not be) taken only as accurate depictions of "anomalies" in the natural world, but also as metaphors or as images to be understood allegorically. With the "discovery" of the New World and the receipt of startling reports of its wildly diverse and bizarre animal species, however, some Renaissance readers no doubt accepted reports of weeping animals as reliable.40 After all, in the seventeenth century, a supposed siren (half woman, half fish) was captured off Brazil by Dutch merchants and carried to Leiden, where it was dissected by a professor of anatomy. It then found its way into a private natural history collection and, through engraved illustrations, into the public's ken. Even in the eighteenth century, noted English phy- sicians and intellectuals were easily convinced that a woman from Sur- rey had given birth to rabbits.41 Such credulity is an indication that the dividing line between the ontological categories of animal and human was not absolute. Yet, ultimately, the cultural significance of the Renaissance reports of weeping crocodiles is not to be found in terms of natural history, but in the 39 Salisbury (n. 22 above), p. 110. Ian Macleod Higgins, a perceptive student of Mandeville's Travels, has recently offered a similar cautionary note about the danger of im- posing our own categories and textual expectations (in this case, "plagiarism") on texts from another time. "The Mandeville author," he writes, "is not a plagiarist, for The Book is not a mindless compilation; it is rather the product of a considered, engaged, and some- times inspired overwriting of its sources that offers readers an often compelling account of matters pious and profane, historical and scientific, mundane and marvelous.... [It] rep- resents a kind of [discursive] field where asynchronous or contradictory cultural forces and elements manifest themselves and where critical analysis will detect a mixture of the re- sidual, dominant, and emergent elements of a given cultural formation" (Ian Macleod Hig- gins, Writing East: The "Travels" of Sir John Mandeville [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1997], pp. 12-13). 40 It is worth mentioning that reports of weeping crocodiles were often found in first-person travel accounts, an important genre of the age, which, by its very nature, lends the narrator's voice a heightened authority. Then, too, it is important to note the purported social status of these reporters, since in legal proceedings and scientific salons of the period, the weight given to the testimony of an individual depended in large part on her or his social identity. Steven Shapin, for instance, has convincingly demonstrated how in seventeenth-century England, scientific "truth" was largely determined by the investigator's social class and the presump- tion that persons of class were by their very nature trustworthy (see Steven Shapin, A Social History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-Century England [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994]). Thus, a report from someone like Sir John Mandeville would have been granted extra credence by some. 41 On this celebrated case, see Dennis Todd, Imagining Monsters: Miscreations of the Self in Eighteenth-Century England (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995). 227</page><page sequence="18">Ritual Weeping way this imaginary creature provided Europeans with a shorthand image of, and label for, human beings whose "nature" was deceitful and insin- cere. No single meaning, though, can encompass the alterity of a weeping animal, which in the shifting contexts of its usage sometimes moves closer to and sometimes more distant from categories such as "human," "moral being," or "authentic self." Elias, Greenblatt, and others have convincingly shown that in the Renaissance the popularity and proliferation of books of manners, which instructed bourgeois readers on how to act like persons of class, signaled an expanded awareness that the social self could be consciously fashioned. In other words, the writers and readers of such how-to books recognized that the social self was (in part, at least) constructed, not an innate inheritance.42 The very suggestion that distinctive manners and emotive displays, among other things, could be learned and then enacted by almost anyone called into serious question the social fictions that class privileges and prerogatives, the unequal distribution of wealth and power, and the existing hierarchical social systems were all "natural" due to the distinct ontological nature of members of these groups. It is in this contentious discursive context concerning manners and emotions, then, that we must understand the Renaissance-era reception of tales of weeping crocodiles and the subsequent uses of the image of "crocodile tears." Dissimulation and simulation were important topics of discussion among theologians, philosophers, and political theorists in the Renaissance.43 By the time Hawkins's account was put in circulation, Machiavelli had already penned The Prince (1513), the classic primer on the political uses of deception, dissimulation, and simulation, including emotional displays. A successful prince, he maintained, needed to be a gran simulatore e dissimulatore.44 Similarly, The Book of the Courtier (1528), by Baldassare Castiglione, included clear instructions on how a 42 See Stephen Greenblatt, Renaissance Self-Fashioning: From More to Shakespeare (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980); and Frank Whigham, Ambition and Privilege: The Social Tropes of Elizabethan Courtesy Literature (Berkeley and Los Angeles: Univer- sity of California Press, 1984). 43 For an overview of the subject, see Perez Zagorin, Ways of Lying: Dissimulation, Per- secution, and Conformity in Early Modern Europe (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1990), pp. 1-37; also, more generally, Sissela Bok, Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private Life (New York: Vintage Books, 1978). 44 Significantly, moder ethologists have come to refer to the ability of animals, birds, in- sects, and so on to employ strategies of deception within their species and with others as "Machiavellian intelligence." See Richard Byrne and Andrew Whiten, eds., Machiavellian Intelligence: Social Expertise and the Evolution of Intellect in Monkeys, Apes, and Humans (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988). Some scholars have resisted using the term universally, arguing that among humans "self-monitoring" can be used in positive ways as well (e.g., to align oneself with social expectations or to avoid conflict). See Mark Snyder, Public Appearances, Private Realities: The Psychology of Self-Monitoring (New York: Freeman, 1987), p. 26. The work of Erving Goffman is also pertinent here. 228</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions courtier should learn to cover the artifice of his style and manners by playing the part effortlessly. Others held that gestures, demeanor, and other external signs must be controlled in order to communicate one's real self. James I (ruled 1603-25), for instance, wrote that a virtuous king must carefully choreograph his gestures and actions because "they inter- pret the inward disposition of the mind, to the eyes of them that cannot see farther within him, and therefore must only judge of him by the outward appearance."45 But then, readers of the King James Bible also had, in the person of King David, a paradigmatic master of the "politics of tears."46 The reports of weeping crocodiles, as well as the widespread quotations they spawned, suggest that a deep anxiety in relation to tears surfaced in the Renaissance. Many persons had (and have) a widespread desire for transparent social relations in which the feelings, intentions, and motives of others would be clear and unambiguous. Yet, social relations are never truly transparent, since feelings and intentions can be (and are) hidden behind masks, silence, or lies, while feelings can be simulated and false in- tentions feigned. In spite of this, at times the phenomenological character of tears has seemed to offer a glimmer of hope that another person's true feelings could be known unambiguously. As drops of clear liquid falling from the eyes (the windows into the soul), tears cross the bodily boundary of interior/exterior and invisible/visible. The symbolic associations of tears with the eyes may explain, in part, the unique position that tears came to hold in the Renaissance among all bodily products.47 Such an appeal to the timeless phenomenological character of tears alone, though, cannot explain the sociocultural and historical specificity of tears shed or represented in the Renaissance. Nor can it begin to deal with the sociohistorical consequences of the growing public recognition that tears could be faked. In the cases of witchcraft and werewolf accusations, superficial appearances were not always held to be sufficient to determine the real identity of somebody. Contestation arose over what kind of tears one was dealing with in a given instance or what kind of person had shed the tears. Some authors implied that tears could be shed for strategic pur- poses, but only by beings whose very nature was duplicitous. These authors drew a dichotomy between true and false tears and, like the author of the twelfth-century bestiary cited earlier, assigned these to constitutionally hon- est and dishonest beings, respectively. It was a short but momentous step from this point to correlating real/false tears with other binary oppositions 45 Basilikon Doron, cited in Katherine Ersaman Maus, "Proof and Consequences: In- wardness and Its Exposure in the English Renaissance," Representations 34 (1991): 29. Surprisingly, Maus never mentions tears in this insightful essay. 46 See Zagorin for many examples of this. 47 It also helps us to understand the voluminous lachrymose literature produced in (and productive of) the "sentimental culture" of the late seventeenth to nineteenth centuries in Europe and America. 229</page><page sequence="20">Ritual Weeping from the age-civilized/primitive, human/less than fully human, and male/ female. Those persons who cried crocodile tears were discursively con- structed as the opposite of the civilized white male. As the Renaissance contest over tears-as-signs was played out in both domestic and foreign are- nas, these Others came to include weird animals (like weeping crocodiles), half animal-half human beings, bizarre persons of color in far-off lands, and, closer to home, women. Shakespeare, among others, genders crocodile tears, as when Othello says of Desdemona, "Oh devil, devil! / If that the earth could teem with woman's tears, / Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile" (4.1.244-46). Shakespeare also blends the ancient Greek humoral theory of how tears are produced, shared with most of his contemporaries, with his gender- inflected understanding of emotions. The following lines from King Henry VI, Part 3 are spoken by Richard, who has just learned the details of his father's murder: I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart; Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen, For self-same wind that I should speak withal Is kindling coals that fires all my breast, And burns me up with flames that tears would quench. To weep is to make less the depth of grief: Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me. (2.4.79-86.) Here, Richard willfully refuses to weep in order to stoke his anger and his desire for revenge. In humoral theory, women are more humid than men and, thus, more susceptible to bouts of weeping. But Shakespeare suggests that adult women can, like men, control their tears-but with a significant difference. Whereas men restrain their tears, women learn to shed tears at will. The copious tears of a woman such as Desdemona do not disclose her real feelings precisely because they are shed at will, rather than spon- taneously. Real tears reveal one's inner emotional state; crocodile tears are designed to mislead others about that state. When discovered for what they are, crocodile tears reveal only one's deceitful nature. In contrast, the mor- ally justifiable (real) tears of a man like Richard, which by sheer force of will are restrained, are transformed into pure acts that express his moral character, authentic nature, and masculinity. We can draw the following implied oppositions: child/adult :: unable to control tears/able to control tears adult female/adult male :: shed tears at will/restrain tears at will crocodile tears/pure acts of moral retribution :: conceal ulterior motives/ reveal interior tears 230</page><page sequence="21">History of Religions THE BLURRED VISION OF RITUAL WEEPING IN THE HISTORY OF RELIGIONS This brief foray into crocodile and gendered tears may help us to understand certain modem treatments of ritual weeping. Scholars have long recognized that acts of European discovery, exploration, and conquest were often rep- resented in gendered terms (e.g., white males "possessing" the New World, itself portrayed as a reclining and inviting female). Similarly, much has been written about the effects of the primitive/civilized dichotomy. Yet, no one has connected these accounts with the depiction and interpretation of ritual tears in the scholarly literature of the last 300 years. Here I will confine myself to a glance at the treatment of the tears of primitives found in the works of Joseph Frangois Lafitau, Durkheim, A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, and Frazier. Lafitau's Moeurs des sauvages ameriquains comparees aux moeurs des premiers temps (1724) is notable for its time in arguing that it was unac- ceptable to judge other peoples by European manners and customs.48 Lafitau proposed a comparative "science of the manners and customs of different peoples," based on carefully assembled concrete facts, which he believed would reveal the universal elements of human culture and reli- gions. He also believed that rituals were the key to unlocking the truth symbolically encoded in myths. No matter how diverse, irrational, or gro- tesque rituals appeared to be, he felt they conveyed a natural symbolic truth, which could be deciphered through his comparative science. In part, Lafitau's positive evaluation of les sauvages ameriquains sprang from his dual assumptions of "the uniformity of sentiments of all nations" and of the notion that all societies passed through the same developmental stages. He felt justified in comparing the customs and affective expres- sions of the "contemporary primitives," whom he knew firsthand from living among them for five years, with reports of early Greek customs and with biblical accounts.49 In significant ways, his comparative method presaged that of W. Robertson Smith in the late nineteenth century. How- ever, Lafitau arranged his materials topically in order to demonstrate the 48 For a brief but useful assessment of Lafitau, see Anthony Pagden, The Fall of Natural Man: The American Indian and the Origins of Comparative Ethnology (Cambridge: Cam- bridge University Press, 1982), pp. 198-209. 49 Lafitau writes of his comparative method, "I was not content with knowing the nature of the Indians, and with informing myself about their customs and practices. I sought in these practices and customs vestiges of the most remote antiquity. I read carefully the works of the earliest authors who dealt with the customs, laws, and usages of the peoples with whom they had some acquaintance. I compared these customs, one with the other; and I confess that whereas the ancient authors have given me some light to support several happy conjectures concerning the Indians, the customs of the Indians have provided me with light for under- standing more clearly and for explaining several things which appear in ancient writers" (Lafitau, Customs of the American Indians Compared with Primitive Times, ed. William N. Fenton and Elizabeth L. Moore, 2 vols. [Toronto: Champlain Society, 1977], 1:27). 231</page><page sequence="22">Ritual Weeping uniformity of human nature, rather than using them to develop a theory of sociocultural change.50 Lafitau records a custom among the Huron and Iroquois, which he terms the "death cry." A returning party of warriors gives out a distinctive cry ("very piercing and sad") to announce the warriors' return and any casu- alties. Villagers rush to receive them, but social protocol governs their affective responses: [The American Indians] have such respect for each other that, however complete may be their victory and whatever advantage they may have gained from it, the first sentiment which they show is that of grief for those of their people whom they have lost. All the village has to participate in it. The good news of the success is told only after the dead have been given the first regrets which are their due. This done, everyone is warned anew by a second cry. They are given a share in the ad- vantage which they have gained and freed to express the joy which the victory has merited.51 Characteristically, Lafitau does not question the authenticity of the emo- tions expressed or the tears shed in this ritual. Indeed, in referring later to the ritual lamentations of native women, he speaks of their tears as "gen- uine tears which the women have always at hand."52 Unlike many later scholars who would maintain that ritual tears have no real connection with felt emotions, Lafitau implies that even mandatory tears are authentic. While he assumes that there is a universal human emotional response to death and a grieving process that all must go through, he also recognizes that any given death does not affect all members of a society in the same manner and to the same extent. As a result, he suggests that some ritual tears are shed out of grief, others out of "respect" and "courtesy." Mourn- ing is a universal "mark of reciprocal tenderness" among human beings and "should be regarded as a duty founded on nature." One of the func- tions of mourning ritual ("law") is, he suggests, to temper and limit tem- porally the emotional outbursts of those most deeply affected by a death. In a unique argument, he suggests that this is also done as "consolation for those who were weeping only as a sham and through courtesy, rather than through a real regret."53 50 Ibid., l:xliv. 51 Ibid., 2:150. 52 Ibid., 2:222. In spite of his generally liberal spirit, Lafitau in many ways still shared the prejudices of his time, including many of the gender assumptions. He believed, for instance, that women have always and everywhere been more given to shedding tears than men have. When he nevertheless has to deal with instances of men ritually weeping, in histories, eth- nographies, or his own experience living among the American Indians, he cannot resist im- plying that they are somehow "naturally" different. Thus, he writes, "The men ... mourn their dead but in a noble manner and one which has not weakness in it" (ibid., p. 220). 53 Ibid., 2:241-42. 232</page><page sequence="23">History of Religions Lafitau clearly recognizes here that after a death certain social expecta- tions guide the actions and affective expressions of the members of any society, yet even those tears shed "only as a sham and through courtesy" are not hypocritical, since they have their own social rationality and utility as signs of respect. No doubt Lafitau's years living among Native Americans allowed him to recognize what today we would call the social construction of emotions and the scripting of affective expressions.54 In characteristic fashion, Lafitau moves back and forth seamlessly from a present-tense ethnographic account of the funerary practices of the Huron and Iroquois to a learned survey in the past tense of reports of similar customs in ancient Rome, Egypt, Libya, and Greece; in contemporary rural France; and as found in the Bible.55 Like many others, he uses the customs, dress, and so on of contemporary primitives to help fill out written accounts of ancient peoples assumed to be at the same primitive stage of development. Thus, after describing the ritual tears and laments of female mourners among the Indians, Lafitau argues that such ethnographic data are of import for clas- sicists and biblical scholars alike: When the body is dressed and put into place, the tears and laments which the mourn- ers have had to restrain until this moment then begin with order and cadence. A woman who replaces, on this occasion, what the Romans call praesica, or the weep- ing woman, intones the first part of the tune. All the other women chant after her, keeping the same measure but applying it to different words suitable to each person according to their [sic] different degrees of relationship with the deceased. ... This artful and systematic way of weeping merits particular consideration. It serves to make us understand what the funeral dirges of the ancients were.56 Perhaps, as a Catholic, Lafitau was more open to accepting the authen- ticity of affective expressions in rituals than were Protestant writers, who had a deep suspicion of "empty ritual." Be that as it may, it would be a long time before anyone attained Lafitau's level of appreciation of the complexities of ritual weeping. Durkheim's treatment of ritual weeping, offered in a few pages near the end of Les Formes elementaires de la vie religieuse (1912), is, without a doubt, the single most influential statement on the topic.57 Unlike Lafitau, Durkheim was an armchair anthropologist who based his comments on ritual tears exclusively on ethnographic reports (e.g., those of Baldwin Spencer and Francis Gillen, Alfred Howitt, and Brough Smyth) concern- ing mourning rites among aboriginal peoples. Much of this ethnographic 54 Ibid., pp. 157-58. 55 Ibid., pp. 218-22. 56 Ibid., p. 218. 57 See Emile Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (New York: Free Press, 1965), pp. 434-61. 233</page><page sequence="24">Ritual Weeping information was gathered-indeed, generated-under the long-distance guidance of Frazer and his questionnaires on totemism and other topics. The ethnographic scenes of mourning were stereotypically informed by the civilized/primitive dichotomy. Durkheim's treatment of ritual weeping was, in part, dictated by the form and quality of his "data," his selective use of his sources, and a num- ber of cultural assumptions of the time. Most notably, of course, the ex- tension of Darwin's theory of the evolution of species to the domain of theories of social development, coupled with the work of Frazer and others on totemism, influenced Durkheim's choice of his object of study. Like Lafitau, he assumed that the study of contemporary primitives would shed light on the past of higher civilizations. After a six-page review of reports of aboriginal mourning rites, Durkheim asks rhetorically how they are to be explained, then provides the answer to this question: One initial fact is constant: mourning is not the spontaneous expression of individ- ual emotions. If the relations weep, lament, mutilate themselves, it is not because they feel themselves personally affected by the death of their kinsman. Of course, it may be that in certain particular cases, the chagrin expressed is really felt. But it is more generally the case that there is no connection between the sentiments felt and the gestures made by the actors in the rite. If, at the very moment when the weepers seem the most overcome by their grief, some one speaks to them of some temporal interest, it frequently happens that they change their features and tones at once, take on a laughing air and converse in the gayest fashion imaginable. Mourn- ing is not a natural movement of private feelings wounded by a cruel loss; it is a duty imposed by the group. One weeps, not simply because he is sad, but because he is forced to weep. It is a ritual attitude which he is forced to adopt out of respect for custom, but which is, in a large measure, independent of his affective state.58 Durkheim's central conclusion-" [ritual] mourning is not the sponta- neous expression of individual emotions"-sets up the implicit contrast with "real" emotional tears, which we have seen before. As an armchair anthropologist, he was dependent upon the ethnographies at his disposal; however, he did not always give his sources equal weight.59 Indeed, at times he used his sources selectively in order to build his own artifice of theory-generated proof. For example, in a footnote after the admission that "in certain particular cases, the chagrin expressed is really felt," he writes: "This makes Dawson say that the mourning is sincere. But Eyl- mann assures us that he never knew a single case where there was a wound 58 Ibid., pp. 442-43. 59 For a recent critical evaluation of the classical ethnographies of the Australian aborig- ines, see Sam D. Gill, Storytracking: Texts, Stories, and Histories in Central Australia (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998). 234</page><page sequence="25">History of Religions from sorrow really felt."60 Without telling the reader why Eylmann should be considered a more reliable source than Dawson, Durkheim simply as- serts that the latter's report concerned an exceptional case.61 Durkheim read thousands of pages of ethnographic reports on aborigi- nal peoples, but he showed a total lack of interest in individual natives. This is not surprising when one realizes that he assumed that individuals as such did not exist among primitive populations.62 Personal feelings and differences are summarily declared to be virtually nonexistent in ritual con- texts: "The only forces which are really active [in mourning rites] are of a wholly impersonal nature: they are the emotions aroused in the group by the death of one of its members."63 This claim is based on a peculiar per- mutation of Lockean sensory psychology and epistemology, which had come to inform the civilized/primitive dichotomy. Primitives, it was be- lieved, experience and represent the world through objects presented to their senses, which create sensate "impressions" in their minds; in con- trast, the minds of civilized people also store ideas and judgments. Thus, according to Durkheim, The foundation of mourning is the impression of a loss which the group feels when it loses one of its members. But this very impression results in bringing in- dividuals together in putting them into closer [physical] relations with one another, in associating them all in the same mental state, and therefore in disengaging a sen- sation of comfort which compensates the original loss. Since they weep together, they hold to one another and the group is not weakened, in spite of the blow which has fallen upon it.... communicating in sorrow is still communicating, and every communion of mind, in whatever form it may be made, raises the social vitality.64 Durkheim's longest passage on ritual mourning is revealing insofar as he presents the reader with a scene of wild wailing, frenzied acts of self- mutilation, and bloody violence-all stereotypic elements of the idea of "the primitive."65 For Durkheim, if you have seen (or read about) one rite 60 Durkheim, p. 442, n. 27. Note, too, the limiting and delegitimating effect of Durkheim's redundant adjectives here-"in certain peculiar cases, of course, the chagrin expressed is really felt" (emphasis added). 61 The texts in question are Erhardt Eylmann, Die Eingeborenen der Kolonie Sudaustralien (Berlin: Reimer, 1908), on peoples of the Western Desert area; and James Dawson, Australian Aborigines: The Languages and Customs of Several Tribes of Aborigines in the Western Dis- trict of Victoria, Australia (Melbourne: Robertson, 1881). Neither work is considered to be very reliable today. Tony Swain suggests Etylmann's study is only of historical interest, while Dawson's is "predictably superficial" on religion (see Swain, Aboriginal Religions in Aus- tralia: A Bibliographical Survey [Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1991], pp. 210 and 259). 62 See Durkheim, p. 18, for a clear statement to this effect. 63 Ibid., p. 447. 64 Ibid., pp. 447-48, emphasis added. 65 Ibid., pp. 435-36, citing Baldwin Spencer and Francis Gillen, The Northern Tribes of Central Australia (London: Macmillan, 1899), pp. 516-17. Richard Huntington and Peter 235</page><page sequence="26">Ritual Weeping of mourning, you have seen them all: "Practices of this sort are general in all Australia.... the real ceremonies of mourning repeat the same theme everywhere; the variations are only in the details."66 Yet, Durkheim can claim uniformity of thought and feeling among the rit- ual actors only by ignoring evidence to the contrary. For instance, he notes that the specific acts and deprivations required of the ritual participants (weeping, diverse forms of self-mutilation, the cutting of hair, imposed si- lence, and so on) vary according to each individual's age, gender, and social relationship with the deceased, yet he does not follow up this lead.67 Nor does he seize on the single ethnographic passage he includes where snatches of the actual voices of aboriginals can be heard.68 Instead, he makes much of Spencer and Gillen's description of the mourners becoming at one point an indiscriminate mass ("we could see nothing but a struggling mass of bod- ies all mixed together")-a description that privileges the vantage point of the external observer while ignoring that of the ritual participants, who are reduced to being mute actors or to emitting incoherent cries and groans. The metaphor of ritual as theater is central to Durkheim's argument that the acts and affective expressions of the ritual actors are dictated (or "scripted") by social custom.69 Even if the action appears chaotic and fren- zied at times, it is nevertheless controlled, although not by the actors them- selves.70 While the natives feel compelled to come together, to weep, and to mutilate themselves, they misjudge the true source of this compulsion Metcalf cite this same passage in their comparative study of funerary ritual, calling it "vivid" twice and "startling." Surprisingly, they do not question the veracity of the descrip- tion at all. Indeed, they find it to be strong both "rhetorically and sociologically," since "one can readily accept that, at a time of death, some people genuinely feel the great emotions that are expressed." Yet, this is precisely what Durkheim denies elsewhere. See Richard Huntington and Peter Metcalf, Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary Rit- ual (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979), pp. 31-33. 66 Durkheim, pp. 437-38. 67 Compare "If mourning differs from the other forms of the positive cult, there is one feature in which it resembles them; it, too, is made up out of collective ceremonies which produce a state of effervescence among those who take part in them" (ibid., p. 445). 68 Ibid., pp. 438-39, where he cites Alfred W. Howitt, The Native Tribes of South-East Australia (London: Macmillan, 1904), p. 459. There Howitt records a few of the cries of rel- atives of the deceased (e.g., "Why did you leave us?" and "My child is dead"), which served to intensify the grief of the others. 69 The connection between ritual and theater was, of course, central to the "myth and rit- ual school" (Jane Harrison et al.) and, later, in a different fashion, to the work of Victor Turner. I am, for the moment, skirting the issue of the signal importance of the ritual-as (or, out of )-theater equations in the history of the academic study of religion. The topic deserves to be studied carefully and fully, going back to the debates over the theater in the Enlight- enment (Diderot, Rousseau, and so on) and among the Romantics. Suffice it to say that in relation to the passage from Spencer and Gillen, it is correct to say that the natives "scripted" the mourning rites, but it is equally the case that this discursive "scene" was rescripted by Durkheim to serve the overarching purposes of his study. 70 Compare "Howsoever great the violence of these manifestations, they are strictly reg- ulated by etiquette" (Durkheim, p. 436). 236</page><page sequence="27">History of Religions (society) when they posit the existence of invisible spirits. While Durkheim rightly recognized that death triggers ordered and scripted acts among the living, in refusing to accept that these actors feel any personal emotions, he turns them into passive figures, mindlessly moved to perform ritual actions. Durkheim's understanding of ritual weeping was largely accepted in Radcliffe-Brown's The Andaman Islanders (1922), although the latter al- lows sentiment a larger role. Indeed, he argues that "the social function of the ceremonial customs of the Andaman Islanders is to maintain and to transmit from one generation to another the emotional dispositions on which the society (as it is constituted) depends for its existence." When a member of the group is removed, through death or some other cause, from an important affective bond, the requisite emotion must find expression in collective ritual activity of some sort, which will restore the affective bond.71 After noting several principal occasions in Andamese social life that require ritual weeping, Radcliffe-Brown repeats Durkheim in part: "The weeping ... is ... not a spontaneous expression of individual emo- tion but is an example of ... ceremonial customs. In certain circumstances men and women are required by custom to embrace one another and weep, and if they neglected to do so it would be an offence condemned by all right- thinking persons."72 Radcliffe-Brown also notes that there are two distinct varieties of ritual weeping-one in which both (or all) parties are active, and another (not considered by Durkheim) in which one person is passive, while another weeps over him or her. Finally, in addition to Durkheim's social function, Radcliffe-Brown offers a psychophysiological explanation of ritual weep- ing, suggesting that it provides relief for individuals from emotional ten- sion. Even when sorrow, grief, or joy as such are not present, there is always "a condition of emotional tension due to the sudden calling into activity of the sentiment of personal attachment."73 All of these explanatory elements are then applied to ritual weeping-as- greeting, the peace-making ceremony, the wedding rite, initiation ceremo- nies, death rites, and secondary burial among the Andamanese. I will confine myself to Radcliffe-Brown's interpretation of ritual weeping-as-greeting: When two friends or relatives meet after having been separated, the social relation between them that has been interrupted is about to be renewed.... The weeping rite... is the affirmation of this bond. The rite, which... is obligatory, compels 71 A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, The Andaman Islanders, expanded ed.

Other moder authors have also offered psychosomatic explanations of the function of tears, including Frey and Langseth (n. 1 above), and Ashley Montagu, "Natural Selections and the Origin and Evolution of Weeping in Man," Journal of the Amer- ican Medical Association 174 (1960): 392-97. 237</page><page sequence="28">Ritual Weeping the two participants to act as though they felt certain emotions, and thereby does, to some extent, produce these emotions in them. When the two friends meet their first feeling seems to be one of shyness mingled with pleasure at seeing each other again.... Now this shyness (the Andamanese use the same word as they do for "shame") is itself a condition of emotional tension, which has to be relieved in some way. The embrace awakens to full activity that feeling of affection or friend- ship that has been dormant and which it is the business of the rite to renew. The weeping gives relief to the emotional tension just noted, and also reinforces the effect of the embrace.74 Radcliffe-Brown's treatment of ritual weeping is superior to Durkheim's in several ways. First, he recognizes that individuals-and individual emo- tions-exist among "primitive" peoples and that their emotional lives are complex like our own. Moreover, he assumes that there are "fundamental laws regulating the affective life of [all] human beings."75 Second, by fo- cusing on the full range of ritual occasions in which ritual weeping is found, he is able to demonstrate that ritual tears are not associated with only one emotion. Finally, he is able to discern a common element among all of the different ritual occasions, from weddings and initiations to funerary rites- ritual weeping either restores an affective relationship or creates a new one in the light of changes in the participants' social positions or roles. Nevertheless, Radcliffe-Brown's work still has some limitations. Like Durkheim, he assumes that in any given ritual, weeping always works in the same way, so he feels no need to study individual ritual performances in detail, nor does he focus on individual participants. As a result, he misses the ways in which individuals at times use or manipulate the social expectations and ritual requirements surrounding ritual weeping for their own intents and purposes. Moreover, he overlooks the ways in which tears mark out moral relationships. Earlier, we noted that Frazer wrote that ritual weeping-as-greeting "is often a simple formality attended with hardly any more emotion than our custom of shaking hands or raising the hat."76 He clearly differentiates "natural" (i.e., real) expressions of emotion from conventional or empty ritual expressions. The latter, he suggests, are especially common "among races at a lower level of culture." While he implies, a la W. Robertson Smith, that the ancient Hebrews may be included in this group, all of the examples of weeping he cites from the Hebrew Bible are asserted to have been authentic emotional tears.77 74 Radcliffe-Brown, p. 241. 75 Ibid., p. 246. 76 Folk-Lore in the Old Testament (n. 6 above), abridged ed., p. 238. 77 Ibid., pp. 238-39. 238</page><page sequence="29">History of Religions One of the reports of ritual weeping Frazer cites is of special interest insofar as it illustrates how, for Europeans, ritual weeping was, to use Greenblatt's phrase, one of the "filthy rites" of primitives. For Frazer, however, it was one thing for Europeans to observe rites that offended their sensibilities, but it was quite another to be forced to participate in them. With a few value-laden editorial comments, italicized below, Frazer sum- marized an early report from North America: A Frenchman, Nicolas Perrot, who lived among the Indians for many years in the latter part of the seventeenth century, describes how a party of Sioux, visiting a village of their friends the Ottawas, "had no sooner arrived than they began, in ac- cordance with custom, to weep over all whom they met, in order to signify to them the sensible joy they felt at having found them." Indeed, the Frenchman himself was more than once made the object, or rather the victim, of the like doleful demonstrations.... A French historian [Claude Charles Le Roy La Potherie] has described the meeting of ["Ayeo," or Iowa] Indian ambassadors with poor Perrot. They wept over him till the tears ran down their bodies; they beslobbered him with the filth which exuded from their mouths and their noses, smearing it on his head, his face, and his clothes, till he was almost turned sick by their caresses, while all the time they shrieked and howled most lamentably.78 Reports similar to this abound in the early ethnographic literature. While they tell us little about the cultural meaning of such instances of ritual weeping for the natives, they tell much about the sensibilities of Europeans at specific moments in history. In the seventeenth century, the Europeans' ignorance of native anthropologies and values militated against a full ap- preciation of the meaning of native rites. How discouraging, though, to discover the situation unchanged in the twentieth century. While Frazer gathered dozens of ethnographic accounts of ritual weeping from around the world, he made no effort to understand the natives' points of view. The civilized/primitive dichotomy encompassed differences in sensibility, so Frazer was secure in his sense of superiority: something was inherently repulsive when he felt it to be so. As a result, his comparative survey of ritual weeping produced little more than the old, tired, and wrongheaded dichotomy of real tears/ritual tears. When Perrot was wept over by the Iowa, this was part of an adoption ceremony. The weeping, along with the Calumet of the Captain ceremony that accompanied it, signified that Perrot was recognized as a reincarnation of a deceased chief, who was being welcomed back. Moreover, precisely because the bodily fluids (tears, mucous, and saliva) rubbed on his face, head, and clothing could be used by an enemy in magic rites to cause the individuals they came from to become ill or even to die, presenting them 78 Ibid., p. 242, emphasis added. 239</page><page sequence="30">Ritual Weeping to Perrot in this fashion served as a public declaration of the trust and friendship among those involved.79 REVISITING RITUAL WEEPING In this essay I have demonstrated that historians of religions, among others, have all too often misunderstood tears and ritual weeping. The critical anal- ysis of LaFleur's reading of a ninth-century Japanese text reveals the danger of carrying some of our commonsense understandings back into the inter- pretation of narratives from other times and places. Our glance at witchcraft and werewolf trials illustrates how the cultural assumption that only hu- mans shed tears was at times used to test the real identity of individuals. A brief look at Renaissance reports of weeping crocodiles discloses that these are best understood not so much as would-be contributions to natural history but as symptoms of a growing dis-ease in some sectors of society over challenges to claims of "natural" or innate class distinction. It was, I argued, no accident that references to crocodile tears began to appear at the same time as the proliferation of books of manners. Similarly, a cursory re- view of selected interpretations of cases of ritual weeping-as-greeting dis- closes additional problems that result from making too much of the fact that ritual weeping is not a spontaneous emotional response, while ignoring the natives' point of view. The history of the interpretation of ritual tears and tales of weeping animals is one of repeated misunderstandings, but in the course of this essay, we have also found some hints as to how these topics might be usefully revisited. A detailed treatment of this subject will have to await a full-length comparative study, but a few preliminary pointers may be offered by way of a conclusion-as-prolegomenon: 1. It is essential that historians of religions abandon the dual assump- tions that all real tears are spontaneous emotional responses and that only humans shed tears. Instead, ritual weeping should be regarded as symbolic activity that marks out the existence or the breach of social and/or moral relationships between beings (human, animal, or suprahuman). 2. Narratives and other representations of weeping animals need to be approached as such, not as the products of misrecognition. Moreover, full attention must be paid to the local religious anthropology, the cultural- symbolic complexes surrounding specific animals (and other creatures), gender constructions, class distinctions, and so on. 3. We need to study individual performances of ritual weeping, rather than only "standard" scenarios. At the same time, we must consider the rel- 79 On this topic, see Robert L. Hall, An Archaeology of the Soul: North American Indian Belief and Ritual (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1997), pp. 1-4. For an anthropo- logical study of similar ritual weeping practices among a contemporary South American Indian people, see Charles Wagley, Welcome of Tears: The Tapirape Indians of Central Brazil (New York: Oxford University Press, 1977). 240</page><page sequence="31">History of Religions ative social positions of the ritual actors, their audience(s), their interde- pendencies, and their respective goals. Doing these things will allow us in our analyses to restore historical agency to the ritual actors, rather than ascribing the motivating force to amorphous "customs" or impersonal social forces. A few examples will illustrate the advantage of this approach and alert us to the politics of ritual weeping. Let me begin with two biblical ex- amples of ritual weeping performed by King David. The first (2 Samuel 1) is more Durkheimian insofar as it describes ritual weeping as marking a rent in the social fabric due to a death, yet the motivation behind David's weeping is anything but impersonal. David is described mourning the death of Saul on the battlefield: "Then David took hold of his garments and tore them, and all the men with him did the same. They mourned and wept and fasted until the evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, for the people of Yahweh, and for the House of Israel" (11-12). David also per- formed a lament for Saul and Jonathan (19-27), which he then ordered to be circulated among all the people of Judah. There was a calculated political motivation behind David's leading these mourning rites. Through his ritual weeping, David publicly displayed his social proximity and fidelity to Saul, even though the king had long sought to have him killed. David also presented himself as close to two polities, whose support would be crucial if he was to accede to the throne of Judah and, later, to become the king of all Israel. In this instance, then, by leading the ritual weeping, David was able to reposition himself symbolically. In and through the ritual scenes of public mourning, he represented himself as a bridge between the past and the future. Compare this to the report of David's subsequent ritual weeping for his young son by Bathsheba, where the primary audience is not human but divine. When his son fell gravely ill, seemingly fulfilling Nathan's prophesy, "David pleaded with Yahweh for the child; he kept a strict fast and went home and spent the night on the bare ground [weeping], cov- ered with sacking" (2 Samuel 12:16). Yet, seven days later, as soon as he was informed that his son had died, he got up from the ground, bathed and anointed himself and put on fresh clothes. Then he went into the sanctuary of Yahweh and prostrated himself. On returning to his house he asked for food to be set before him, and ate. His officers said, "Why are you acting like this? When the child was alive you fasted and wept; now the child is dead you get up and take food." "When the child was alive," he an- swered, "I fasted and wept because I kept thinking, Who knows? Perhaps Yahweh will take pity on me and the child will live. But now he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again?" (20-23). 241</page><page sequence="32">Ritual Weeping Nothing could be clearer than this passage: King David's tears were not spontaneous emotional responses to his son's death; he could turn them on and off at will. But it is also clear that David was not compelled to weep by an impersonal and unconscious force. In order to understand the logic be- hind his behavior, we need to consider the cultural complex of ritual weep- ing, moral contracts, and the ancient Middle Eastern concept of kingship.80 The first point to note is that this is an instance of ritual weeping-as- appeal. In such cases, a relatively powerless person throws him or herself at the mercy of a hierarchically superior and powerful figure. In the ancient Near East, widows, orphans, and other helpless figures could obtain a hear- ing from a king by throwing themselves weeping on the ground in front of his procession. A moral contract, if you will, obtained between the king and his subjects such that he was to be the final protector of those who had no others to offer them protection. Given this general understanding, a king who did not pause to listen to the plaint of such an individual risked being branded as a bad king. Here, ritual tears shed by the lowly are, to borrow a phrase from James C. Scott, weapons of the weak, which could at times coerce a social superior to play his or her part in a sanctioned social and moral relationship. When King David ritually weeps in the case above, however, he adopts the inferior position of the prostrate weeping petitioner before Yahweh. Insofar as relations with Yahweh were imagined and acted out as analo- gous to those which obtained between human kings and their subjects, the same symbolic logic and social rationality was at work. Before Yahweh, David adopts a humble ritual position (and sheds all the markers of his own kingship) in the hope that his tears might move the deity to pity him, forgive his sin of having caused Uriah's death, remove His curse, and, finally, spare his child's life. His weeping is part of a calculated, but not failsafe strategy ("Who knows? Perhaps Yahweh will take pity on me"). When this ritual appeal fails, however, David immediately ceases his mourning since it no longer serves a rational purpose. One would be right, then, to note that these ritual tears are not a spon- taneous expression of the emotion of grief. Yet, even if David's actions offend our own sensibilities, a little reflection on the politics of the case will allow us to understand why, even if he actually felt grief, this emotion would probably not have found extended public ritual expression. David's political power was in no way threatened by the death of this son. The 80 The literature on ancient Middle Eastern kingship is voluminous. On ritual weeping and kingship, see the following selected works: Richard Nelson Boyce, The Cry to God in the Old Testament, SBL Dissertation Series no. 103 (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1988); Paul Wayne Fer- ris, The Genre of Communal Lament in the Bible and the Ancient Near East (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1992); Flemming Friis Hvidberg, Weeping and Laughter in the Old Testament: A Study of Canaanite-lsraelite Religion (Leiden: Brill, 1962); and Cheryl Meinschein, Cries of the Brokenhearted: A Study of Laments in Scripture (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 1988). 242</page><page sequence="33">History of Religions child's mother did not come from a family or tribe whose political support was critical for him and, more important, the child had never figured in David's dynastic hopes. Although some of his staff wondered about his re- sponse to the news of his child's death, David observed a distinction be- tween his public and private persona, which included his expression of emotions. Had he continued to mourn for this son, he may well have opened himself to a whispering campaign suggesting that he was overly emotional and weak, too enamored of Bathsheba, and so forth. If his tears were not spontaneous expressions of emotion, this was because there was a rational political calculus at work.81 Not only kings weep ritually, of course. In many societies, weeping is identified as a female activity,82 yet their ritual tears are equally political, albeit at a different level. In order to demonstrate this, it is important that we look at specific cases of ritual weeping by ordinary women in order to correct the assumption that this activity serves one general social function. A number of recent studies of female mourning practices in rural Greece provide exemplary material for this purpose. In her study of oral laments, Anna Caraveli has shown that lamentation provides Greek women with a potential vehicle of social protest and for presenting a "self" or a social identity to the world that differs from that which others (read "society" in Durkheim's sense) would impose on them. "Lamentation," she writes, "be- comes for the singer an avenue for social commentary on the larger world, rather than an instrument of restriction and isolation."83 This is the case be- cause, while all rituals are scripted to a large extent, in mourning rites there is still room for conscious improvisation or "ad-libbing." Moreover, pre- cisely because mourning rites are scripted as emotionally charged, they can at times provide "cover" for individuals to transgress or violate normal social expectations and prohibitions without fear of serious reprisals. In some displays of mourning, the ritual actor behaves as if beside herself. She loses control of herself-tears her hair or clothing, appears in public with disheveled hair, covers herself with ashes or filth, slashes herself, and so on. In her grief, whether real or feigned, she is not held to be responsible 81 In Ritual Poetry and the Politics of Death in Early Japan (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1989), I showed that ritual funeral laments and mourning practices in the ancient Japanese court displayed a similar pattern. Laments and rites for those in line to succeed to high positions of power were more elaborate, involved extended public rites, invoked mythic images, and styled the rent in the social fabric in cosmic terms, while la- ments and rites for members of the imperial family far removed from the succession were more personal in imagery and tone, focused on the personal grief of the surviving spouse, and were more cursory in form and performance. 82 See Paul Rosenblatt et al., Grief and Mourning in Cross-Cultural Perspective (New Haven, Conn.: Human Relations Area File Press, 1976), p. 11. 83 Caraveli (n. 5 above), p. 191.

Numerous ex- amples of this from Greece and elsewhere have been recorded.84 Ritual weeping is also found outside religious rituals proper, but such "ritualized" tears also participate in a shared moral discourse. Margaret Egnor, for instance, has shown how untouchable women in Tamil Nadu employ an oral genre known as "crying songs" in order to express publicly "some grievance the singer has against some particular person of higher status than herself" or some egregious inequity in the social system.85 In these songs, sung while tears flow down the singer's cheeks, she describes her social situation, her moral purity, the wrongs she has suffered, and her emotional state resulting from these. Significantly, the singer always casts herself in an inferior social position vis-a-vis the object of her criticism. In Tamil Nadu, as in most cultures, hierarchical social relationships and rela- tionships of dependency carry certain social and moral expectations and responsibilities with them. The thrust of crying songs is that these have been violated. "[The aggrieved woman] calls herself a lily, a lotus, gold, paddy, gram, fresh green herbs; she is deserving of protection. The kinship term she uses for herself is 'younger sister.' But her perfection has brought her harm, through no fault of her own."86 The tears shed while singing a "crying song" publicly mark the breach of a moral contract, but they can also offer a critique of the oppressive as- pects of the social system. Crying songs "protest not only the personal sufferings of the singer, but the rules of hierarchy themselves."87 Similar ritual tears, which seek to implicate superiors in a moral economy, will be found in many other cultures as well. Such rituals may serve to (re)create a communal identity, but this is frequently a subgroup or minority identity within a larger society. To move outside gender relations for a moment, the public ritual weeping at the center of the Shicite Muslim festival of Mu- harram, memorializing the massacre of Hussain and his family, is a strik- ing example of how this collective expression serves to recreate a minority identity within a larger religious tradition.88 84 Compare C.

For instance, in many cultures, a woman who weeps for her deceased husband, a relative, or a neighbor thereby displays that she and/or her family embody specific cultural and moral values associated with being a proper wife, mother, and so on. In rural Greece, "the lamenter honorably represents her family at village death rites .... Women are responsible for every phase of the care, grieving, and commemorization of the dead. Just as they nurture bonds among the living, they are expected to extend the connection of ponos (car- ing, yearning, pain) to family beyond death through adherence to mourn- ing practices."89 Just as in life a man's honor (timl) is dependent in part on the behavior of the women of his family, his posthumous honor is depen- dent upon his wife and female relatives offering laments and tears for him. For a woman, engaging in ritual weeping also serves as a mark of her changed social status. Her mourning cohorts, usually postmenopausal women, have all suffered the pain of numerous deaths. In this situation, a young widow is an especially tragic figure, prematurely thrown into this so- cial and ritual status. Older women, however, gain respect and, at times, a far-flung reputation by participating in collective rites of ritual weeping. Historians of religions need to pay attention to the potentially multiple (and occasionally contested) meanings of specific instances of ritual weeping. One final example must suffice to suggest how the social expectations placed on ritual actors can be strategically violated in order to offer a pow- erful moral indictment of another person. Gail Holst-Warhaft has recounted the story of a striking, transgressive ritual act of a Greek woman, known as Koundounara, who afterwards became a famous lamenter in the late nine- teenth and early twentieth centuries. The tale, which still circulates orally to- day, over a century later, complete with her words, merits citation at length: Koundounara's husband came from the village of Layia. He took his [younger] bride by force and shut her up in his house. She soon became pregnant and gave birth to a son. The child was born a little before Easter, the time of the Epitaphios ceremony in which women play a major part. Koundounara's husband said to himself, "Since she's given birth she won't leave me." So he let her go to the church, to help the other women with the preparations for the ceremony, but she took the opportunity to escape to her father's house, abandoning her child. When her husband went to fetch her back Koundounara refused to go with him saying: "If you want me to come back to your house and remain your wife, you'll have in Contemporary Islam: Shi'i Devotional Rituals in South Asia (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1993). Schubel shows how the public rites of weeping also func- tion to create local identities within a city, as different groups of young men compete against each other for acclaim as ritual performers. 89 Susan Auerbach, "From Singing to Lamenting: Women's Musical Role in a Greek Vil- lage," in Women and Music in Cross-Cultural Perspective, ed. Ellen Koskoff, Contributions in Women's Studies, no. 79 (New York: Greenwood Press, 1987), p. 28. 245</page><page sequence="36">Ritual Weeping to bring back a heifer with a bell on it and you'll come through this door on your knees." Her husband found the heifer, put a bell around its neck and went to fetch his wife. She came back to him as she had promised, but to avenge himself he poured scalding oil over her, burning her badly. When her husband died Koun- dounara sat at the wake with her relatives. Suddenly she took a small lamp, lifted her skirt and stood astride his coffin reciting this little verse: "Look Dimitri / at the little plaything [the word kak6, meaning a child's toy or game is used here to refer to her own vagina] you scalded / once upon a time. / Dimitri, I straddle you / and may my plaything make you jealous."90 This is a perfectly transgressive act-not only does the newly widowed woman not offer the expected ritual tears for her deceased husband, she exposes the long-hidden truth of his horrific physical abuse by exposing her scarred body to the world. The boundaries of public and private are transgressed precisely to reveal the husband's past moral transgressions. In straddling her husband's corpse, Koundounara reverses the "normal" sex- ual positions and the gender expectations of their relative positions of power. The younger wife now "rides" her husband and taunts him that she will go on to enjoy sexual pleasures now denied to him. Not only that, she transforms her scarred body into a site of pleasure at once denied to her husband and scandalously offered to others. This tale (her-story) has been preserved for over a century, passed down over the generations and cir- culated among women far beyond the immediate area in which the events took place. It has served, no doubt, as a cautionary tale for men, warning that they cannot always count on a woman to shed ritual tears in order to witness their good nature and bring them honor. It may also serve as a cau- tionary tale for historians of religions, reminding us that more than "cus- tom" motivates ritual actors to weep or to withhold their tears. Ritual tears-both shed and unshed-are telling. As historians of religions, we must develop new ways of listening carefully for the tales that they tell.
