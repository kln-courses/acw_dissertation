<plain_text><page sequence="1">D. J. BAKHURST THOUGHT, SPEECH AND THE GENESIS OF MEANING: ON THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF VYGOTSKY'S MYSLENIE I RECy ABSTRACT. This article seeks to present Vygotsky's theoretical perspective as an integral whole as an antidote to the desire to plunder his work for isolated insights. The first part of the paper treats Vygotsky's views on method: his critique of the prevail ing psychological orthodoxies; his recommendation that the higher mental functions be seen as standing in interfunctional relations of mutual determination; his technique of 'unit analysis'. The second part discusses the method in action: Vygotsky's genetic account of the development of consciousness, on which the key point in ontogenesis is taken to be the convergence of two intitially independently developing faculties: thought and speech; the notion of internalisation and its defence; the critique of Piaget; the concepts of 'inner speech' and developed thought. The author hopes this article will serve as an aid to reading the limited sources of Vygotsky's writings presently available in English. Introduction On the opening page of MySlenie irec' Vygotsky points out a mistake which, he thinks, frustrates the progress of contemporary psychology: psychologists typically pay lip service to the thesis of the unity of consciousness and then proceed to individuate, by some criteria, the particular functions which constitute consciousness and to treat their development as isolated and self contained processes. Ironically, Vygotsky's critics and followers are often tempted into an analogous error when approaching his work: they admit the unity of Vygotsky's contribution to psychology, but when it comes to testifying to his genius, they fall back upon the enumeration of particular pregnant but isolated insights. Vygotsky is applauded for his conception of the sign as tool, his development of the notion of internalisation, the methodology of 'unit analysis' and so on; but what seems to be lacking is a picture of his work as a coherent whole into which the various insightful theses fall into place. This deficiency is frequently excused by appeal to the fact that Vygotsky's work is disorganised and unfinished. It is argued that Vygotsky's embryonic and exploratory contribution does not invite treatment as a systematic body of theory, but should rather be seen as a potential source of insight and Studies in Soviet Thought 31 (1986) 103-129. ? 1986 by D. Reidel Publishing Company.</page><page sequence="2">104 D. J. BAKHURST inspiration which may inform contemporary psychological investigations. However, this approach runs contrary to Vygotsky's own conception of his contribution. In the preface to Myllenie i rec\ the book which represents the culminating point of his research, Vygotsky writes: Our research is complicated and many-sided in its composition and structure, but never theless, each particular task confronted in the separate sections of our work was so far subordinated to the general aim, and so far connected to previous and subsequent sections, that we may hope that the work as a whole represents in essence a unified investigation which is totally, in all its parts, directed to the solution of the basic and central problem: the genetic analysis of the relation between thought and word.1 This article is an attempt to capture the integral theoretical perspective at the heart of Vygotsky's 'unified investigation' through an account of the main tenets of his work which reveals their mutual relations. The objective is to restore this theoretical position to the centre of the stage of Vygotsky scholarship. Although the primary purpose of this article is expository, if successful, it should further the debate on just how far Vygotsky succeeded in approaching a 'new theory of consciousness' and what might need be done in order to develop or revise his position in the light of contributions by other psychologists and philosophers. It will also be a consequence of this paper that we better understand who may legitimately appeal to Vygotsky for support, a popular pastime among psychologists from diverse fields. In particular, this paper is intended to aid readers who wish to discern the unity of Vygotsky's theoretical stance in the limited English translations of his writings. Unfortunately, many Western readers are acquainted with Vygotsky's work only through Thought and Language, Hanfmann and Vakar's heavily abridged version of MyMenie i rec".2 It is now generally agreed that the editors' abridgements mutilated the text. The situation was improved by the publication of Mind in Society, a patchwork composition drawn from a number of Vygotsky's writings, constructed by Michael Cole and others. The composite form of this work was necessitated by the fact that, at the time of its production, few of Vygotsky's writings were available in the original, and even fewer were properly edited. Mind in Society has rightly been applauded for the intelligent exegetical and editorial work of Cole and his collaborators. But paradoxically, however much Cole may have wished to depart from the editorial techniques of Thought and Language, the methods he was forced to employ by the shortage of material are all too similar. In both Thought and Language and Mind in Society the dominant presence of</page><page sequence="3">VYGOTSKY'S MYSLENIE I RE?' 105 the editors conveys the impression that Vygotsky's work must be restored by experts before it is suitable for general consumption and before it can be put to use by the psychological community.3 Fortunately, the Pedogogika publishing house has recently begun the publication of a six volume edition of Vygotsky's collected works in Russian.4 The gradual emergence of these texts has rejuvenated our understanding of Vygotsky's position and set new standards for Vygotsky scholarship. However, it is no help to readers confined to English sources to be told that if only they read Russian they would attain a richer picture of Vygotsky's work. For this reason, I have endeavoured wherever possible to illustrate this article by reference to texts available in English.5 I. VYGOTSKY ON METHOD 1.1. The critique of the Prevailing Climate Vygotsky is much applauded for his attention to problems of methodology in psychology. He was peculiarly sensitive to the question of how the psy chologist's procedures can infect the object of investigation, and in all his major works, the task of developing a self-conscious awareness of his own methods takes the centre of the stage. Vygotsky believed that if we are to make sense of what we seek to understand, the method of enquiry must be properly adequate to the object of investigation. Therefore to address the question of what is the appropriate method is already to confront the issue of the nature of the object. He writes The search for method becomes one of the most important problems of the entire enterprise of understanding the uniquely human forms of psychological activity. In this case, the method is simultaneously prerequisite and product, the tool and the result of the study.6 The reader will therefore appreciate that the division of this paper into two parts, a treatment of Vygotsky's views on method and a discussion of the method's application to the relation between thought and speech, is under taken merely for purposes of exposition. Vygotsky would never have sought to draw a firm divide between methodological and substantive questions. Vygotsky's preoccupation with methodology should not be seen as an attempt to square the global explanatory claims of Marxism with the</page><page sequence="4">106 D. J. BAKHURST autonomy of the individual sciences, a question which dominated discussion among Soviet philosophers in the same period.7 Rather, it grew in response to what he called the 'crisis in contemporary psychology'. Vygotsky saw the climate of the psychology of the day as a conflict between a variety of warring camps. Introspectionism, the 'zoopsychology' (zoopsikhologija) of Pavlov and the related reflexology of Bekhterev, the psychopathology of Freud and Watsonian behaviourism all presented forthright and insightful contributions to the principal question in psychology: the characterisation of human consciousness. But the relation in which these various theories stood to one another and the question of how we were to evaluate the contribution of one from the point of departure of another was by no means clear. The unity of psychology as a science was threatened. Nevertheless, it was not just in this point of interpretation that the crisis consisted, for what was transparent to Vygotsky was that all these theories had failed to give a proper account of the nature and development of the 'higher mental functions' without which theories of consciousness and personality were impossible to construct.8 In the light of this failure it was unclear how psychological investigation was to proceed. Vygotsky's response was to underline the methodological significance of this 'crisis' with a critique of the prevailing orthodoxies, emphasising in particular the following three considerations. Firstly, it was uncertain what a theory of the higher mental functions could consist in. Not only reflexology and zoopsychology but also introspectionism now worked within the explanatory framework of 'stimulus-response'. But where the former pretended to an explanation of all mental phenomena in those terms, the latter maintained that the more developed features of man's cognitive world would not yield to such a treatment and the psychologist must rely exclusively on the introspective reports of the subject of study. For Vygotsky, the defect of the stimulus-response model was that it conceived of "the relation between human behaviour and nature as unidirectionally reactive".9 But the distinguishing feature of human intellectual capacity is that man, by the use of tools and, more richly, the use of language, is able to mediate between 'stimulus' and 'response'. Man is able to conceive of this object or situation as demanding a certain course of action, to question the correctness of this conception in the light of previous experience and to project and evaluate various alternative procedures. This self-conscious or 'reflexive' cognitive grasp of the subject on the relation in which he stands to the demands of the world immediately makes a mockery of the thought that</page><page sequence="5">VYGOTSKY'S MYSLENIE I REC' 107 just this parcel of experience should be conceived as a self-contained stimulus which necessitates just this response. However the introspectionist denial of the possibility of a scientific account of the nature of the higher mental func tions is equally unattractive. It simply rests on the assumption that such an account could only be given in stimulus-response terms and, if this is impossi ble, psychologists must give up the thought of a scientific psychology.10 The second consideration turns around the extent to which psychology may employ the a priori. Vygotsky is highly suspicious of the thought that the psychologist can do 'conceptual analysis' to establish the nature of psychological faculties prior to empirical investigation. And further, he attacks as unexplanatory the related stronger thesis that, in some sense, the psychological faculties themselves exist prior to experience, that the child somehow comes into the world already equipped with consciousness, which subsequently develops under the influence of the surrounding reality, but is in no way created by it.11 However, Vygotsky is quick to criticise the reac tion to a priorism in the psychology of Piaget, who, in his early work at tempted to concentrate entirely on the documentation of 'facts'. Against such a procedure Vygotsky makes the now familiar response that the choice of experiments and the interpretation of the resultant 'facts' are made according to our theories. The task of developing a non-aprioristic psychology cannot rest on the erroneous presupposition that we can disentangle the facts from the theory in which they have a life: psychology must carve itself a path between a priorism and naked empiricism.12 Thirdly, Vygotsky is highly critical of the thought that we can somehow build up a grasp of the higher mental functions in humans out of an under standing of more primitive psychological mechanisms. This once more puts Vygotsky at odds with Pavlov and his supporters, who according to Vygotsky, attempt to follow the path which nature herself has taken. Vygotsky, on the other hand, claims that the complex may be the key to the comprehension of the simple, that our understanding of primitive psychological functions rests on a grasp of higher mental capacities. Quoting Marx, Vygotsky reminds us that "the anatomy of man is the key to the anatomy of the ape".13 1.2. Vygotsky's Functionalism Perhaps the best way to understand Vygotsky's critique of the prevailing climate is to consider the alternative method he offers, the central thrust of</page><page sequence="6">108 D. J. BAKHURST which is the following. Vygotsky holds that in order to understand the unity of consciousness properly we must conceive of the various psychological faculties, thought, memory, speech, will etc., as standing in interfunctional (me?funkcioni?) relations of mutual determination. That is, each particular faculty is to be analysed functionally: we seek to characterise its nature by grasping what it does; it is to be thought of as being employed, or employing itself, for some purpose in some activity, and the key to its nature lies in grasping why and how it comes into play in the way that it does.14 This basic functionalist perspective is spiced by the following consideration. We seek to determine what function a particular faculty fulfils by observation and experiment. But when we come to consider, say, the child's ability to classify objects, we see that the activity which we want to call 'classification' changes according to the level of development of the child. This familiar truth leads us naturally to seek to account for these changes and we find that we can do so only if we concentrate on how developments in other faculties have made possible this change in the activity the child undertakes when asked to classify objects. The idea of each psychological faculty possessing its own immanent logic of development is ruled out. It is so because, unless we introduce a prior conception of what is to count as classification, we cannot answer the question of why it is appropriate to think of the different activity the child performs at various stages of development as manifestations of a single faculty. This can be made transparent only by attention to the way in which developments in other faculties make possible or precondition the transformation of the one under investigation. In an important sense the essence of a particular faculty lies outside it. What it is, and what it may become, is determined by the development of other psychological functions. In the course of development, the relations of mutual determination between faculties change. Vygotsky's special brand of functionalism provides a vantage point from which the unity of his theoretical perspective is visible. It should now become clear why he insists that psychologists should study the higher mental func tions as processes in development and not as static forms and why he claims that only a 'genetic' reconstruction of the development of the object which reveals the causal and dynamical relations in which it stands will count as an explanation of its nature. In short, Vygotsky's emphasis on historical accounts of psychological phenomena can be seen as a consequence of his particular brand of functionalism. Another such consequence is the</page><page sequence="7">VYGOTSKY'S MYSLENIE I REC' 109 thought that mental development is dialectical: 'qualitative leaps' occur between stages in the development of particular faculties, leaps precipitated by the maturation of other faculties. For that reason, it would be mistaken to look for an account of the nature of a particular mature faculty by reduc ing it to the form in which it first appears (e.g. "What understanding is is 'just catching on'", "What thought is is the ability to solve problems by means of tools" etc.). And therefore, it also will not do to think of mature psychological functions as simply grounded in their primitive antecedents, either ontogenetic or phylogenetic. Vygotsky writes: Psychological processes as they appear in animals actually cease to exist; they are incor porated into this system of behaviour and are culturally reconstituted and developed to form a new psychological entity.15 1.3. Thought, Speech and 'Unit Analysis' According to Vygotsky, the most central relationship in psychology is the relation between thought and speech, which he considered "the key to the nature of human consciousness". The revealing discussion of this relation in the opening chapter of Myslenie i rec' provides a vital insight into Vygotsky's conception of interfunctional relations and the methods appropriate for their analysis. It is important to be clear about the reference of the terms 'thought' and 'speech' in this opening discussion. By 'thought' (my?lenie), Vygotsky means 'thinking', 'mental activity', the thought process at the heart of consciousness. By 'speech' (rec*) or 'word' (slovo), Vygotsky means overt linguistic behaviour, the physical production of noise in order to engender a response from another. Obviously, prior to the investigation of the relation between thought and speech, it would beg the question to provide detailed definitions of the two relata. The point is simply to draw attention to the fundamental contrast from which the psychology of consciousness starts: the contrast between the 'internal', mental activity of thinking, and the external, physical activity of our linguistic and communicative practices.16 The relation between thought and speech turns out to be peculiarly difficult to elucidate, and Vygotsky sets out to learn from mistakes com mitted by other psychologists. He notes that psychology has taken one of two erroneous approaches to the problem. The first holds that the relation between thought and speech is one of identity. Such a theory would be one which held, for instance, that thought was to be conceived as 'speech</page><page sequence="8">110 D. J. BAKHURST minus sound', or that thought must be reduced to its expression. Vygotsky criticises this reductionist stance on the grounds that the problem it sets out to solve simply disappears in the way the problem is set up.17 The second strategy treats thought and speech as two logically distinct processes, sepa rately individuable, and related in "purely external interaction".18 Here, the psychologist attempts to explain the relation between thinking and linguistic behaviour in terms of the 'mechanistic' interaction of independently intel ligible properties of the relation's component parts. Vygotsky calls this procedure 'analysis into elements', and argues against it by means of an interesting analogy perhaps prompted by Marx. To treat thought and speech in this way is like trying to explain why water extinguishes fire by appeal to the propensity to extinguish fire of (a) hydrogen and (b) oxygen. Such an attempt at explanation fails since hydrogen burns and oxygen sustains fire.19 Vygotsky contrasts 'analysis into elements' with his proposed alternative: 'analysis into units'. A 'unit' (edinicd) is a "product of analysis which, unlike elements, retains all the basic properties of the whole and which cannot be further divided without losing them".20 Therefore, in the analogy, the H20 molecule, and not the properties of hydrogen and oxygen considered sepa rately, should be taken as the unit of analysis when considering water's pro pensity to extinguish fire. Vygotsky proposes that the psychologist should search for the appropriate unit of analysis when attempting to explain the resultant properties of the interrelation of two psychological phenomena, in this case, thought and speech. Now, it may be objected that Vygotsky's celebrated recommendation is no more than quasi-scientific speculation. He offers 'unit analysis' as a univer sal method. But why should we believe that such a procedure will work in all cases? (We have not yet seen it work in one.) And how is the scientist to decide what he is to count as the unit? Independently of the functionalist background above described, unit analysis provides no criterion whatsoever for the determination of the relevant units and read in the light of Vygotsky's functionalist method it simply amounts to the platitude that we should not 'go beyond the functional level', breaking up the system under investigation to the degree that we cease to see how the parts come to play their respective roles in the whole. However, this objection is unfair.21 It is certainly wrong-headed to suggest that Vygotsky offers unit analysis as a ready-made formula for the solution of</page><page sequence="9">VYGOTSKY'S MYSLENIE I REC' 111 all psychological problems. To grasp the point of Vygotsky's suggestion we have to return to the fallacy committed in 'analysis into elements'. The problem with that method was that it treats thought and speech as two logically distinct processes. Now, Vygotsky's insight is that the relation between thought and speech is an internal relation. By the metaphor of 'internality', Vygotsky seems to have in mind the logical dependence of the two relata: that we do not understand what it is to exercise one independently of understanding what it is to exercise the other. The criteria by which we individuate the two faculties are inextricably interwoven. That is, we cannot identify something as an expression of (developed) thought without appeal to considerations about the way in which that thought is made manifest to others, is expressed in behaviour, and conversely, we cannot identify linguistic expressions independently of considerations about that which they express, without seeing them as a manifestation of thought. This fact inclines us to look for a relation of identity between thought and speech. But we do so in the face of our intuition that, at least in their developed forms, thought and speech represent two distinct faculties engaged in two quite different processes.22 The psychologist must be able to preserve the 'reflexive', 'inter nal', 'private' and distinctively mental domain of thought, and contrast this with the 'external', 'public' and communicative nature of the physical expression of speech. In a dialectical frame of mind, congenial indeed to Vygotsky's universe of discourse, we might say that the psychologist strives to give sense to an identity of opposites.23 So, if we are to understand the nature of thought and speech, we must analyse the internal relation which holds between them. What methods of analysis are appropriate here? Since the internal relation has been described as a 'logical' relation, and logical relations are thought to hold exclusively between concepts, it might seem natural to employ some kind of conceptual analysis. If the relation is logical in kind, we can settle the question of its nature a priori, by inspecting the concepts of thought and speech. But what ever the epistemological credentials of 'conceptual analysis', Vygotsky's hostility to the method seems well placed here, for it would require a far richer grasp of the concepts of thought and speech than is available to the psychologist at this stage in the enquiry. It is not that the content of the concepts is given to the investigator, leaving him only to trace the relations between them. Rather, his investigation must determine both the scope of the concepts and the nature of their relation. Furthermore, to rest our hopes</page><page sequence="10">112 D. J. BAKHURST on conceptual analysis implies not only that we can individuate the related concepts successfully, but also that the relation between them is static, a presupposition that presumably requires argument. We have said that the logical dependence of thought and speech can be presented as a fact about the criteria of individuation of the two faculties. But the way in which we feel compelled to individuate manifestations of the two faculties is a fact which itself requires explanation. According to Vygotsky's position, this explanation must be sought not in purely conceptual space, but by attention to the way in which thought and speech are related in the development of the human individual. The psychologist turns to the world. The investigation begins with an hypothesis: that the internal relation between thought and speech is a relation of mutual determination. That is, it is only within this relation that the two faculties can develop. If we wish to treat them as two distinct processes, we may do so not as a prior condition of the relation between them, but as its consequence. Thought owes its indepen dence to speech and vice versa. Now, Vygotsky holds that if the psychologist can tell the story of the development and mutual determination of the two relata, he will have given an explanation of their nature. If he is to do this the psychologist must confront the question of what explains the very possibility of the relation between thought and speech. To grasp this would be to provide a perspective from which (to continue the dialectical terminology) the identity of the two opposites is visible, from which their 'unity in diversity' is expressed. This factor is the 'unit'.24 It is invoked not as a dialectical recipe for instantly successful psychology, but as a response to the problem of the analysis of internal relations. In Myslenie i rec\ Vygotsky proposes the notion of meaning (znacenie) as the unit of analysis of thought and speech. But this too is an hypothesis. There is no decision procedure for determining the appropriate unit in advance. The choice is simply grounded in an obvious intuition. We feel that meaning is clearly a necessary condition for both thought and speech, at least in all but their most primitive forms. It is conceptions of significance and of representation that transform primitive mental and speech behaviour into truly human intellectual and social life. So the choice of unit is neither given, nor is it backed by any logical guarantee. The selection will be vindicated only by the degree to which it contributes to the explanatory power of the genetic account of which it will be a crucial part. The discussion of method inexorably leads us into the 'substantive' issue</page><page sequence="11">VYGOTSKY'S MYSLENIE I REC' 113 of the construction of Vygotsky's genetic account of the relation of thought and speech in the history of the development of the higher mental functions in ontogenesis. To Vygotsky's proposals for such an account we now turn. II. THE METHOD IN APPLICATION II. 1. The Independence Thesis According to Vygotsky's genetic account, thought and speech initially exist as independent faculties which, in the course of their development, eventually converge. The concept of meaning (the unit) is vital at the point of contact of the two courses of development, for the convergence occurs when the child can employ speech as an aid in intellectual activity, when he begins to exploit the representational and symbolic power of speech. Thus at the point of convergence it becomes possible to think of the child's speech as properly meaningful. The meeting point of these two lines of development is the crucial moment in ontogenesis, making possible the subsequent mutual determination of the two faculties and facilitating the development of the other higher mental functions. Vygotsky puts his position thus: (1) In their ontogenetic development, thought and speech have different roots. (2) In the speech development of the child, we can with certainty establish a preintellectual stage, and in his thought development, a prelinguistic stage. (3) Up to a certain point in time, the two follow different lines, independently of each other. (4) At a certain point these lines meet, whereupon thought becomes verbal and speech rational.25 Clauses (1)?(3) mark out Vygotsky's 'independence thesis'; the final clause raises the issue of the convergence of the two hitherto independent lines of development. Before we consider the problem of convergence we must ask what grounds the independence thesis. In the statement of the independence thesis, the terms 'thought' and 'speech' operate in the following way. By 'prelinguistic thought', Vygotsky has in mind primitive forms of problem solving activity which can plausibly be described in intentional terms however crudely, while by 'preintellectual speech' he means to include any form of noise-making which is social in that it is directed towards some audience, however indeterminate, and which commonly elicits some response from that audience, however general in kind. It is these faculties that Vygotsky claims to be able to relate to the earliest</page><page sequence="12">114 D. J. BAKHURST stages of child development. The aim of his study is then to make sense of the possibility of their convergence and mutual transformation. The immediate objection must be: if we have no right to a priori concep tions of the nature of psychological faculties, by what authority do we ground these definitions? The discussion in Thought und Language encourages us to think that the basic structure of Vygotsky's reply would be as follows. First, we argue that no one can deny the existence of primitive intellect in chimpanzees and other apes, neither can one contest the fact that they possess 'speech' in the sense defined above. However, we can show experi mentally that speech does not play a significant role in the problem solving activity the chimpanzees attempt. Thus the 'independence thesis' is estab lished in the case of apes. Second, we try to move directly from this to the assertion of the validity of the independence thesis for human children by appeal to the fact that the stage of development which we encounter in apes represents a stage in the phylogenesis of the related species, man, and that, in some sense, stages of phylogenesis are repeated in the ontogenesis of each human individual.26 It would be better if Vygotsky did not appeal to an argument of this kind since the second step is somewhat question-begging. It should be a consequence of our analysis of the relation of thought and speech that we can speak to the question of the relation between human and animal mental development. It would be unwise to support the first moves in the analysis by appeal to a specific account of that relation. And indeed, I do not think that this is the best way of represent Vygotsky's position. Rather, I suggest that Vygotsky should be seen as starting his investigation from a position analogous to that of the 'radical interpreter' who figures so prominently in philosophy influenced by Quine and Davidson.27 However, Vygotsky's radical interpreter is not only concerned to attribute particular propositional atti tudes to a speaker of the language as part of a general theory of translation rendering the activity of the subject intelligible. Rather, he also sets himself to answer the question of which manifestations of the behaviour of the subject are to count as manifestations of the same type: what is it to think of these phenomena as deliverances of, say, belief, these of memory and so on? My contention is that it is just good radical interpretation to accept the truth of the independence thesis. We can think of the initial definitions of thought and speech as hypotheses marking out minimum behavioural criteria for the presence of these faculties. This choice is of course based on our</page><page sequence="13">VYGOTSKY'S MYSLENIE I REC' 115 present conceptions and will only ultimately be vindicated as part of the developed explanatory theory of the higher mental functions as a whole. However, Vygotsky does assert that 11 is my belief, based upon a dialectical materialist approach to the analysis of human history, that human behaviour differs qualitatively from animal behaviour to the same extent that the adaptability and historical development of humans differ from the adaptability and development of animals. The psychological development of humans is part of the general historical development of our species and must be so understood.28 It would not therefore be surprising if he sought to support his hypotheses by appeal to an analogy along the lines suggested above. Although this may win over a recalcitrant soul, it will clinch nothing, since Vygotsky's opponent might equally argue that our tendency to attribute intellect to apes is pure anthropomorphism, resting on our understanding of primitive intellectual activity in humans. II.2. Internalisation and the Convergence of Thought and Speech We turn now to consider the crucial point of contact in the development of thought and speech. Vygotsky writes, The most significant moment in the course of intellectual development, which gives birth to the purely human forms of practical and abstract intelligence, occurs when speech and practical activity, two previously completely independent lines of develop ment, converge.29 Vygotsky claims that the meeting of the two lines of development takes place when speech begins to play a role analogous to the tool in problem solving activity, when the child's speech takes on a symbolic or representational character and can be employed to bring about a desired end.30 So our genetic account is obliged to make sense of how the child comes to grasp notions of meaning and significance, to provide an account of the genesis of meaning in ontogenesis. Vyogtsky offers the following picture. The symbolic relation between noise, or word, and object or action is set up only in the context of the child's involvement in relations with others. From birth, the child participates in situations in which his or her behaviour is significant for others. Actions and movements the child makes come to have meaning for the adults who surround the child. The adults come to treat some of these movements as signs, but the sign does not enter the situation as something</page><page sequence="14">116 D. J. BAKHURST which has meaning for the child; it only acquires its significance in virtue of the function the movement takes on for the adult participants. This function then undergoes a process of 'internalisation' and becomes endowed with meaning for the child. Vygotsky beautifully illustrates his position with the following example of the development of the child's ability to point: We call the internal construction of an external operation internalisation. A good exam ple of this process may be found in the development of pointing. Initially, this gesture is nothing more than an unsuccessful attempt to grasp something, a movement aimed at a certain object which designates forthcoming activity. The child attempts to grasp an object placed beyond his reach; his hands, stretched toward that object, remain poised in the air. His fingers make grasping movements. At this initial stage pointing is repre sented by the child's movement, which seems to be pointing to an object - that and nothing more. When the mother comes to the child's aid and realises his movement indicates some thing, the situation changes fundamentally. Pointing becomes a gesture for others. The child's unsuccessful attempt engenders a reaction not from the object but from another person. Consequently, the primary meaning of that unsuccessful grasping movement is established by others. Only later, when the child can link his unsuccessful grasping movement to the objective situation as a whole, does he begin to understand this move ment as pointing. At this juncture there occurs a change in that movement's function: from an object-oriented movement it becomes a movement aimed at another person, a means of establishing relations. The grasping movement changes to the act of pointing. As a result of this change, the movement itself is then physically simplified, and what results is the form of pointing that we may call a true gesture. It becomes a true gesture only after it objectively manifests all the functions of pointing for others and is under stood by others as a gesture. Its meaning and functions are created at first by an objec tive situation and then by people who surround the child.31 So Vygotsky offers us a view of "internalisation" as "a series of transforma tions" or "a long series of developmental events" in which "an operation that initially represents an external activity is reconstructed and begins to occur internally"; the activity of the child which is significant for others, in the given context, becomes significant for the child.32 The notion of internalisa tion is therefore the key to understanding the possibility of the convergence of thought and speech, the harnessing of speech through the idea of represen tation to serve as a tool in problem solving activity. Further, Vygotsky makes the yet stronger claim that internalisation is the source of all the higher mental functions, which owe their origin not to the immanent logic of development of the faculties themselves, but to social forms of activity in which the child is forced to participate. He writes:</page><page sequence="15">VYGOTSKY'S MYSLENIE I REC' 117 Every function in the child's cultural development appears twice: first on the social level, and later, on the individual level; first, between people (interpsychological), and then inside the child (intrapsychological). This applies equally to all voluntary attention, to logical memory, and to the formation of concepts. All the higher mental functions originate as actual relations between human individuals.33 Thus, for Vygotsky, the 'social interaction' of the child with his elders is not simply the origin of particular beliefs, desires, hopes, intentions etc., but the source of the child's very capacity to believe, to desire, to hope, to intend. 'Socialisation', the all-pervading influence of the community upon the child, is not to be conceived as that which in principle limits individuality, but as that which makes possible the child's emergence as a self-determining subject. Vygotsky's position represents a theory of the social genesis of the self.M Vygotsky's position poses many important questions. I shall concentrate here on one possible objection to the key notion of internalisation. This objection invites us to reconsider the long quotation above where Vygotsky explains how the child develops the ability to point. Vygotsky tells us that at some stage the child 'realises' that his grasping movements represent his wants to the adults around him and acquires the concept of pointing: he internalises a primitive language rule, (e.g., "when you want x, point to x"). But something seems to be missing in this account. We lack an explanation of just how the child is able to "link his unsuccessful grasping movement to the objective situation as a whole". How does a purely material operation suddenly become endowed with significance for the child? It seems that Vygotsky offers us an entirely external account of internalisation. But of course we are all familiar with a third-person account of how the child acquires concepts; but that just neglects the real issue. If we are to under stand how the child comes to see his actions as meaningful, this must manifest itself as a relation between the child and the contents of his mental world. That is the place where we should search for the essence of meaning, but this 'internal' side of the question has been left entirely out of account. This objection makes two related and misguided assumptions. Firstly, it seems to imply that any satisfactory account of the process of internalisation must make sense of what the process is like from the point of view of the child. Now, it is true that we know Svhat it is like' for a subject already possessing a language to acquire new concepts, since we are quite familiar with this from our own case. Nevertheless, even if we could show that such</page><page sequence="16">118 D. J. BAKHURST 'first-person' knowledge was a necessary condition of understanding con cept-acquisition by already competent language-users (and this is highly contentious), the availability of such a first-person account could never be a condition of adequacy for a theory of the child's acquisition of his first concepts. We have no idea how to imagine what it is like to develop the ability to imagine, to think about what it is like to come to be able to think, hope, want, believe, intend, etc. And we have no idea not through a lack of imagination, but because there is simply no idea to have. The qualitative leap from a stage of primitive problem solving activity to fully developed consciousness mediated by language cannot be retrospectively bridged by an act of imagination; or rather, such an act of imagination could only consist in the very kind of account Vygotsky provides. The second faulty presumption of the objection is that meaning must be analysed in terms of a special relation between the subject (the child) and the contents of his mental world. On this view, some fact about the mind of the subject determines what he means. Therefore, facts about meaning are distinctively subjective facts, graspable perhaps only from a subjective point of view. Accordingly, it is natural to assume that if we seek to explain the inauguration of this relation we are required to capture the relevant subjective facts; we must 'look into the child's mind' where the difference made by successful internalisation will be decisively marked. A good example of such a position is classical empiricism, which holds that words or signs have meaning as the names of ideas. Ideas are conceived as private mental entities, which are like pictures of objects. They represent the world to the subject, who refers to objects in the word via his ideas. Now, such a conception of meaning, which could motivate the objection to Vygotsky, has been conclusively attacked by Wittgenstein.35 I shall not rehearse the private-language argument here, but restrict myself to the follow ing observation. On the objector's empiricist picture, concept-acquisition or internalisation is understood as the child coming to associate a certain sign with a particular idea: the child comes to name his sensations. But such a conception is fraught with difficulties. If the idea is thought of as a mental 'picture', it will surely require interpretation if the child is to set up just the correct association between sign and idea. But such interpretation would require powers of abstraction and memory, conceptions of relevance and similarity, which we have no right to assign to the child learning his first language. We are required to attribute to the child conceptual tools the very</page><page sequence="17">VYGOTSKY'S MYSLENIE I REC' 119 origin of which we are trying to explain. (And even if we could think of the child possessing such tools, what within his private mental world could constitute the standard of correctness of their use?) Of course if we suppose that there is another idea in the child's mind which somehow gives a particular interpretation to the first idea we simply raise the same problems at this new level. It seems that the only way out of this problem is to assert that the ideas before the child's mind need no interpretation, that they are intrinsically representational. But this is a desperate move. Clearly, the onus of proof is now on Vygotsky's adversary to make sense of his 'intrinsically representa tional mental objects'. But this obligation he surely cannot discharge, for at best the invocation of such objects is just a metaphysically charged way of saying that interpretation must end somewhere, and at worst it is the incanta tion of the very philosophical prejudice which Vygotsky is challenging: that meaning can only be understood as a special property of mental objects.36 II.3. Internalisation and the Critique ofPiaget We have shown that this notion of internalisation can be defended, at least against the present criticism. But there is a second and related way in which internalisation figures in Vygotsky's work which emerges in his critique of the early Piaget's notion of 'egocentric speech' in children. According to Piaget, egocentric speech in children is a manifestation of the child's 'autistic thought' at the early stages of his development. As the child becomes involved in social forms of communication, egocentric speech diminishes and eventually disappears, 'driven out', as it were, by the dominant social forms. Against Piaget, Vygotsky argues that egocentric speech is a stage in the child's assimi lation of social forms of communication as a device for the solution of problems. At a certain point in his development the child will accompany the undertaking of tasks with a barrage of egocentric speech. Vygotsky shows that the child's performance is impaired if he is forced to do the task silently, and that the child's speech is primarily social in kind, for the level of ego centric speech drops if the child is alone. However, the child cannot be thought of as attempting to communicate an appeal for help. Although we cannot yet think of the child as properly 'talking to himself or 'reasoning with himself, Vygotsky holds that egocentric speech is the genetic root of verbal thought or 'inner speech'. At this point the child 'talks himself through' the action; his speech figures as part of the object or the activity in question.</page><page sequence="18">120 D. J. BAKHURST Eventually egocentric speech ceases, but its disappearance is only a disappear ance from view. We can show experimentally that when the child who accom panies action a by egocentric speech e comes to accomplish a without e he will nonetheless report e when asked what he is doing or has done. Thus we form the hypothesis that egocentric speech has become 'inner speech' and we name this transformation 'internalisation'. (Here we are concerned with the internalisation, not of linguistic rules, but of overt speech patterns.) Where for Piaget the direction of explanation went [autistic thought -&gt; egocentric speech -&gt; social speech], for Vygotsky the situation is reversed: [social speech -? egocentric speech -? inner speech]. This usage of the term Internal isation' is both clear and obviously defensible, since a sceptic can simply be shown cases where egocentric speech 'turns inward' in the way described.37 H.4. Inner Speech and Thought Vygotsky's critique of Piaget introduces his highly influential notion of 'inner speech'. He defines it thus: Inner speech is not the interior aspect of external speech - it is a function in itself. It still remains speech, i.e., thought connected with words. But while external thought is embodied in words, in inner speech words die as they bring forth thought. Inner speech is to a large extent thinking in pure meanings ['senses' would be a more consistent translation - D.B.]. It is a dynamic, shifting, unstable thing, fluttering between word and thought, the two more or less stable, more or less firmly delineated components of verbal thought.38 It is important to note that Vygotsky does not think of inner speech as somehow irretrievably embedded in the private cognitive world of the subject, which the psychologist can only investigate indirectly, through the subject's introspective reports. Inner speech is not the shadowy hidden accompaniment of external thought, or external thought with the volume somehow turned down; it is a function in its own right. Therefore, Vygotsky is always inter ested in its public pedigree, both in its origin in egocentric speech and in its later manifestation in certain forms of discourse. Vygotsky holds that inner speech has its own peculiar syntactic and semantic features. The most prominent syntactic peculiarity is the 'predical isation' of inner speech; that is, since he supposedly knows what he is 'talking' about, the 'speaker' "tends to leave out the subject and all words connected with it, condensing his speech more and more until only predicates are left".</page><page sequence="19">VYGOTSKY'S MYSLENIE I REC' 121 Thus Vygotsky concludes that "predication is the natural form of inner speech; psychologically, it consists of predicates only".39 This thesis Vygotsky claims to be able to corroborate experimentally. Vygotsky argues that the semantic peculiarities of inner speech rest in the fact that it is thought 'in pure senses'. To attempt to clarify this idea he draws on Paulhan's distinction between sense and meaning.40 The distinction, which is not at all clear in Vyogtsky's presentation, seems to treat 'meaning' as the dictionary style definition of the concept, while 'sense' represents the sum of psychological events aroused in consciousness by the word. While the former is said always to remain constant, the latter is in a state of constant flux. This shifting sphere of sense is invoked to account for the richness of 'sentences' of inner speech which owe their composition to the juxtaposition and amalgamation of 'images', and for the difficulty of understanding a manifestation of the pure inner speech of others due to its peculiarly indi vidual or subjective character. Although the primitive distinction between sense and meaning is dis tractingly unexplanatory, the motivation for his view deserves articulation. Vygotsky never lost his early interest in the language of literature.41 There is no doubt that he felt that it was precisely 'inner speech' to which the poet gives expression. Now, what Vygotsky seeks to express in these cryptic remarks on the semantics of inner speech is a conceptual framework in which we can do justice to the idea that the poet can convey a rich semantic content with a few linguistic components. In such a case we cannot see the meaning of his words as tied to rigid assertibility conditions. The grip his words have on the world must be capable of changing in an imaginative and creative way. Further, I think that Vygotsky would resist the idea that such a phe nomenon should be consigned to some outer region of the theory of meaning, for we cannot a priori rule out the explanatory power of such semantic flexibility at the level of the early development of linguistic abilities. Behind the plane of verbal thought there lies a level even more inward than inner speech: the plane of thought itself. According to Vygotsky, "the flow of thought is not accompanied by the simultaneous unfolding of speech".42 The reasons he cites for forcing a wedge between developed thought and speech are that (a) our criteria for identifying thoughts and sentences differ: one thought may be expressed in a number of different ways, and (b) we sometimes experience a difficulty putting a thought into words. Thought plays the role of the shifting cognitive background of the</page><page sequence="20">122 D. J. BAKHURST subject's mental world against which each particular component ? belief, desire, intention, hope ? is given sense, and against which alone the subject's utterances can have meaning. He writes: Every sentence that we say in real life has some kind of subtext, a thought hidden behind it. .. Every thought creates a connection, fulfills a function, solves a problem ... Thought itself is engendered by motivation, i.e., by our desires and needs, our interests and emotions. (Therefore,) behind every thought there is an affective-volitional tendency, which holds the answer to the last 'why' in the analysis of thinking.43 Conclusion With this last *why', we come to the end of our exposition of the general structure of Vygotsky's theoretical position. We followed his thought from his critique of the prevailing climate to his recommendations for a 'new theory of consciousness' based on the idea that the higher mental functions stand in interfunctional relations of mutual determination. On the way, we have encountered many rich and provocative ideas: the notion of 'unit analysis', genetic explanation, the concepts of internalisation and inner speech. This paper has tried to exhibit the way in which these notions are held together by a unified theoretical vision which must be grasped if the full potential of Vygotsky's ideas is to be revealed. Vygotsky's work is not merely of academic significance. Although there are fascinating parallels to be explored between Vygotsky's contribution and the work of the later Wittgenstein, Vygotsky would have been appalled by Wittgenstein's remark that philosophy "leaves everything where it is".44 For Vygotsky, the answers to philosophical questions, such as the intelligibility of the a priori, the truth or falsehood of behaviourism, and the refutation of methodological solipsism, make a difference to how we do psychology. And in turn, psychology searches for a theory of consciousness which will inform both education and medicine and which will contribute to the building of the new society, a society which itself is founded upon a philosophical vision.45 As we have seen, Vygotsky held that the focal point, the unit, of the new theory of consciousness was meaning. If we apply his technique to the analysis of his own contribution, we are compelled to conclude that the unit of such an analysis must be praxis. For Vygotsky, the identity of psychology as a science depended on the degree to which it could contribute to the transformation of the object it investigates. Its task was not simply</page><page sequence="21">VYGOTSKY'S MYSLENIE I REC' 123 to mirror but to harness reality. The passion and energy Vygotsky devoted to this end is challenging and exciting, and many have felt its pull. Its attrac tion is the stronger when the unity of the work in which it is manifest is revealed.46 NOTES 1 L. S.

The reader will encounter here not a literal translation of Vygotsky but rather our edited translation of Vygotsky, from which we have omitted material that seemed redundant and to which we have added material that seemed to make his points clearer." (p. x). 4 L. S. Vygotsky, Sobranie socinenij, in six volumes, (1982-). This long-awaited collec tion of Vygotsky's writings contains much material which has been highly influential in Soviet psychological circles, but has never before been properly edited and published. An excellent example is the early classic IstoriZeskij smysl psikhologiZeskogo krizisa, (The Historical Meaning of the Crisis in Psychology), (Vol. 1, pp. 291-436). A full bibliography of Vygotsky's works is given in Mind and Society (pp. 141-151). Unfor tunately the editors provide only translated titles of the works and the journals in which they appeared, leaving the reader to work out the Russian original. It is sad that we have had to wait so long for the systematic publication of Vygotsky's works. His masterpiece, My?lenie i re?' appeared just after his premature death in 1934. But soon afterwards Vygotsky was subjected to severe criticism for his 'eclecticism' and his interest in 'bourgeois authors'. Furthermore, Vygotsky's theory of the socio-historical development of mind seemed to entail that communities which were culturally and historically backward were severely disadvantaged in a way that the Soviets' accession to power could not instantly remedy. Witness P. Zin?enko, writing in 1939: "Vygotsky's principal mistake occurred when he reduced the sociohistorical determination of the human mind to the influence of human culture on the individual. The development of the mind was thus restricted to the limited dialogue of human consciousness with culture, while material interaction between human subject and reality was abandoned" ('Problema Neproizvolnogo Zapominanija', inNauZnye zapiskikharkovskogo pedinstituta inostrannykh jazykhov 1 (1939), p. 153, quoted in A. Kozulin, Psychology in Utopia, Cambridge, Mass., M.I.T. Press, 1984) p. 111. On such grounds, Vygotsky fell victim to the campaign against pedology and intelligence testing and his works were blacklisted until 1956 when an edition of selected works, Izbrannye psikhologiZeskie issledovanija,</page><page sequence="22">124 D. J. BAKHURST appeared. It includes Myilenie i ret' and five articles written between 1928 and 1934, collected under the title Problemy psikhileskogo razvitija reb?nka (Problems of the Mental Development of the Child). The criticisms which were brought against Vygotsky's works by his former colleagues and associates, such as Luria, Leontiev and Zincenko, are very hard to evaluate. For instance, the criticisms often rest on the contrast between, on the one hand, 'history and culture' and, on the other, 'material interaction with objects' (predmetnaja dejatel'nost*) as prime movers in the development of mind. But it is far from obvious how this contrast is to be made out, let alone that Vygotsky's emphasis on history and culture necessarily proceeds only at the neglect of material interaction with objects. However, it would be unwise for the historian of Soviet psychology to interpret the assault on Vygotsky as exclusively the consequence of the political expediency of his former collaborators as they sought to preserve their security in the turbulent political climate of the era. The thrust of these objections is at least indicative of the emergence of certain trends of thought within Soviet psychology which were to be influential. For example, the point of departure of Leontiev's 'theory of activity' has its roots in the early attacks on Vygotsky, whether they were well founded or not. The literature still awaits a detailed analysis of the relation between Vygotsky and his followers and his influence on their subsequent theories. Readers interested in this subject should consult the chapter on Vygotsky in Kozulin (op. cit.). Despite this criticism at the hands of his followers, Vygotsky's influence on the development of Soviet psychology has been enormous. Indeed, it is now familiar to speak of a 'Vygotsky School' which includes Luria, Leontiev, Me^?erjakov and Davydov. Karl Levitin's account of this movement in One Is Not Born a Personality (Moscow, Progress, 1982), presents the erroneous picture of a community of psychologists in happy agreement about the relevance and importance of Vygotsky's work. In so far as it neglects the violent controversies about the status of Vygotsky's contribution between members of this school, Levitin's book is misleading. However, this is not unprincipled distortion. The members of the Vygotsky school have rallied around Vygotsky's authority for more than purely theoretical reasons. They have sought to form a united front against the positivistic forms of empirical psychology which now dominate the Soviet psycho logical literature. Thus, it is no surprise that Levitin's book represents a manifesto of shared concern. Read in this light, One Is Not Born a Personality is a valuable text, especially since Levitin draws on a wealth of unusual material, including interviews with the major figures. 5 The Vygotsky bibliography in Mind in Society provides a list of his writings available in English (p. 151). Apart from the two already cited, the only other major work which has been translated at the time of writing is The Psychology of Art (Cambridge, Mass., M.I.T. Press, 1971), a collection of articles on literary criticism and aesthetics which span several decades and which were published only posthumously as Psikhologija Iskusstva (Moscow, 1965). (Unfortunately, Vygotsky's much acclaimed essay on Hamlet, 'The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark', which was included in the second Russian edition (Moscow, 1968), does not appear in the English version.) In addition, The Concept of Activity in Soviet Psychology, edited by James V. Wertsch, (New York, M. E. Sharpe, 1981) contains two translated excerpts from Razvitie vysSikh psikhifeskikh funkcij and 'The Development of Higher Forms of Attention in Childhood' ('Razvitie vys^ikh form vnimanija v detskom vozrast?*) from the 1956 Izbrannye psikhologiteskie issledovanija (pp. 389-425). The article 'Play and its Role in the Mental Development</page><page sequence="23">VYGOTSKY'S MYSLENIE I REC' 125 of the Child', which appears in a Vygotsky memorial edition of Soviet Psychology 3 (1967), is another valuable source. Although the situation of the student of Vygotsky confined to English sources is currently very poor, a great improvement is on the horizon. The M.I.T. Press is now preparing a revised translation of My?lenie i rec', and the Plenum Press, New York, is planning to publish translations of all six volumes of the Sobranie so&amp;nenij. 6 L. S. Vygotsky, Mind in Society, p. 65 (Vygotsky's emphasis). 7 For the controversies in philosophy, see I. Yakhot, Podavlenie Filosofa v SSSR, 1920-30 gody (New York, Chalidze, 1981), or D. Joravsky, Soviet Marxism and Natural Science (London, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1961). 8 The notion of the 'higher mental functions' (vys^ie psikhiZeskie funkcii) is one of the basic concepts of contemporary Soviet psychology which owes its origin to Vygotsky (see Psikholog?teskij slovaf, ed. V. V. Davydov and others, (Moscow, Pedagogika, 1983), p. 65). The expression is sometimes translated as 'complex psychological processes'. In this paper, I have treated the 'higher mental functions' as those functions picked out by the 'language of propositional attitudes': thought, belief, desire (volition), memory, intention, etc. Although this choice is not uncontroversial (for, interestingly, the vocabu lary of propositional attitudes does not settle down comfortably into Russian), it should cause no problems here and will render my exposition clearer to those familiar with Western analytic philosophy of mind. 9 L. S. Vygotsky, op. cit., p. 61. 10 The crucial point is that Vygotsky felt that both introspectionism and behaviour ism were caught in the same 'logic', in the same way of posing the question about the role and relevance of consciousness. I do not mean to imply that Vygotsky's objections to behaviourism and reflexology entail a blanket hostility to the explanatory power of the terminology of the 'new' psychology. The potential of the notion of a reflex in the theory of consciousness is a constant preoccupation of Vygotsky's writings on the 'crisis'. See especially the first volume of Vygotsky's Sobranie soZinenij (Moscow, Pedagogika, 1982). 11 See L. S. Vygotsky, Mind in Society, pp. 45ff. 12 See L. S. Vygotsky, Thought and Language, Ch. 2, esp. p. 11. 13 See L. S. Vygotsky, Istorifeskij smyslpsikholog??eskogo krizisa, in Sobranie soZinenij, Vol. 1, especially Section One. 14 The idea that a faculty 'employs itself is not intended to have vitalistic overtones, but to signal the fact that each function does not require an 'operator'. It is fatal to the functionalist's case to think of there being a 'something' independent of the interfunc tionally related faculties (e.g. the Self) which puts them to work. On Vygotsky's position, as I present it, it would be natural to think of the person or self not as something over and above the higher mental functions and their deliverances, but as the totality of these faculties in their interfunctional relations. Note that Vygotsky's functionalism should not be confused with the brand of functionalism currently popular in Western analytic philosophy of mind. Note also that throughout this paper I have used 'faculty' and 'function' as alternative translations of the Russian funkcija\ 15 L. S. Vygotsky, Mind in Society, p. 57. 16 The English words 'thought' and 'speech' perfectly capture the contrast Vygotsky seeks to draw, and I shall use these terms throughout my exposition. It would be wrong to substitute the term 'language' for 'speech' and think that one had preserved the</page><page sequence="24">126 D. J. BAKHURST contrast Vygotsky had in mind. Talk about language already invokes talk about 'meaning' and other intensional notions, which are not supposed to be in play in Vygotsky's initial contrast. After all, he wishes to argue that we can only make sense of the relation between thought and speech if we introduce the concept of meaning as the vital com ponent of both relata. Therefore, Hanfmann and Vakar can be faulted for translating the title o?My?lenie i re?' as Thought and Language. 17 L. S. Vygotsky, Izbrannye psikhologiteskie issledovanija, p. 44, (Thought and Lan guage, p. 2). 18 Ibid.,p. 45. 19 Ibid., p. 46, (Thought and Language, p. 3). Marx mentions the paradox that water consists of two highly inflammable gases in Wages, Price and Profit, Sec. VI, Marx and Engels Selected Works in One Volume, (London, Lawarence and Wishart, 1968), pp. 206-207. 20 Ibid., p. 48, (Thought and Language, p. 4). 21 I have pressed this objection for the following reasons. The condensed discussion in Thought and Language conveys the impression that Vygotsky invokes unit analysis as a kind of magical recipe for guaranteed success in psychological investigation, and that he does so on very scant grounds. The reader may conjecture that, at best, all this can amount to is the kind of optimistic, but ultimately contentless methodological recommendations which abound in Soviet philosophical and psychological writings. For instance, anyone familiar with the literature will be used to being inundated with remarks about the relevance of the notion o? activity as a 'methodological principle'; but it is rare to come across a serious discussion of why the concept is relevant and just how it is supposed to inform our enquiries. I am therefore anxious that my reader should see that Vygotsky's contribution is immeasurably richer than the typical discussions of method in Soviet psychology and philosophy. Indeed, Vygotsky's work is the absolute antidote to such discussions. This is particularly important since contemporary treat ments will only serve to reinforce the conjecture that unit analysis is no more than abstract methodological speculation. For instance, V. P. Zihcenko and N. D. Gordeeva in Funkcional'naja struktura dejstvija, (Moscow, Moscow University Press, 1982), pp. 9-12, offer eight requirements that any unit must satisfy ("The unit must be a living part of the whole," "the unit of life-activity must be capable of development, including self development" etc.), but the criteria by which these requirements are selected remain a complete mystery. The reader is left to wonder whether he is offered hard principles, presumably grounded in some kind of dialectical logic, or simply (very obscure) rules of thumb. An account of Vygotsky's motivation for adopting unit analysis should not only reveal the seriousness of his treatment of method, but also aid our understanding of commentaries such as Zinc'enko's. For once we have seen what is at issue in unit analysis, we can evaluate the plausibility of the requirements Zincenko sets on the notion of a unit. 22 Wittgenstein's discussion of the relation between thought and speech in the opening sections of volume two of Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology (Oxford, Basil Blackwell, 1980) reveals the tension between the urge to reduce thought to speech and the desire to do justice to the autonomy of thought: "The word 'thinking' can be used to signify, roughly speaking, a talking for a purpose, i.e., a speaking or writing, a speak ing in the imagination, a 'speaking in the head', as it were." (para. 9). "It isn't true that thinking is a kind of speaking, as I once said (cf. Notebooks 12.9.1916). The concept 'thinking' is categorically different from the concept 'speaking'. But of course thinking is neither an accompaniment of speaking nor of any other process." (para. 7).</page><page sequence="25">VYGOTSKY'S MYSLENIE I REC' 127 23 Vygotsky's discussion of unit analysis is an excellent example of dialectical logic in action, and it is here that Vygotsky's debt to Marx is most obvious. However, there is so much disagreement about the interpretation of Marx that it would hardly be rigorous to continually signal aspects of Vygotsky's position as 'Marxist' or 'dialectical' without considerable argument. Since I am anxious that Vygotsky's ideas should speak for themselves I have avoided such signalling and trust that Vygotsky's dialectical mind will be manifest in my presentation of his arguments and that readers familiar with Marx will detect his influence. Readers who want a more explicit account of this influence should consult especially Istor??eskij smysl psikhologiZeskogo krizisa (Sobranie sotinenij, Vol. 1) and My?lenie i rec' (unfortunately, the references to Marx and Hegel were edited out of Thought and Language). 24 A 'unit' (edinica) can also be refered to as a 'cell' (kletocka or jatejka) or ?pxn (natalo). It also bears an interesting relation to the idea of the "concrete universal" (konkretnoe vseob??ee) as developed by Soviet philosophers such as Il'enkov who have attempted to develop Marx' method in a way influenced by Vygotsky, see Dialektika abstraktnogo i konkretnogo v "Kapitale"Marksa, (Moscow, 1960). (Translated as The Dialectics of the Abstract and the Concrete in Marx's Capital (Moscow, Progress, 1982).) 25 L. S. Vygotsky, Thought and Language, p. 44. 26 At the time Vygotsky was writing there were several competing theories about the relation between onto- and phylogenesis inspired by M?ller-HaeckePs 'Biogenetic Law': ontogenesis is a repetition of phylogenesis. Vygotsky was highly critical of psychologists who argued that this repetition was a matter of biological inheritance (Stanley Hall, for instance, held that the ontogenetic development of the child is conditioned by an inherited causal process defined by the course of evolutionary development of the species). See Vygotsky's entry 'Biogeneti?eskij zakon' ('Biogenetic Law') in BoHaja sovetskaja enciklopedija (The Great Soviet Encyclopedia), 1st ed., vol. 6, (Moscow, 1927), cols. 275?9. For Vygotsky, the important symmetry between onto- and phy logenesis was to be made out in the following way. The crucial achievement in the phylogenesis of the human species is the development of the ability to use tools in problem solving activity, and most importantly, the development of language as man's most sophisticated tool. The genesis of meaning and the birth of ideality mark the transformation of man from animal to human. Likewise, the point at which the child grasps conceptions of meaning, significance and representation is the vital stage in ontogenesis which precipitates the child's development into a fully self-determining subject of knowledge and morality. But the child does not inherit the phylogenetic achievement biologically, but socially. It is preserved not in the physical structure of his body, but in the practices of the community into which the child is born. The child must then make these practices his own, he must internalise them. The important asymmetry between onto- and phylogenesis is that, while ontogenesis presupposes a prior community of language users, the practices of which the child assimilates, phy logenesis obviously cannot be represented as the appropriation of somehow already existing practices. 27 The 'radical interpreter' (or 'radical translator' as Quine has it) is pictured as attempt ing to provide a theory of translation for an unknown language from scratch. He must determine what each sentence of the language means on the basis of observations of the behaviour of the community of speakers whose language he is interpreting. The example makes clear that determining what the speakers mean requires us to determine what they believe, desire, intend, hope etc. However, it is easily seen that this is true not only when we interpret a foreign language, but also when we make sense of speakers of our own</page><page sequence="26">128 D. J. BAKHURST language. Therefore, the device of the radical interpreter is helpful when we pose ques tions about just what is at issue when we attribute propositional attitudes to speakers. For the original radical interpreter and the various uses to which he is put, see W. V. O. Quine, Word and Object (Cambridge, Mass., 1960), Ch. 2, and D. Davidson, Inquiries into Truth and Interpretation (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1984) pp. 123-179. 28 L. S. Vygotsky, Mind in Society, p. 60. 29 Ibid., p. 24. 30 However, Vygotsky is anxious not to overdo the comparison of word with tool. See Mind in Society, pp. 52-53. 31 Ibid., p. 56. 32 Ibid., pp. 56-57. 33 Ibid., p. 57. The notion of the function appearing "inside the child" is ambiguous between the idea that the function acquires its place as a constituent of the child's cognitive world internally related to the other constituents, and the thought that the function may be conceived as (at least in part) a physical or neurophysiological process actually taking place inside the child's body. Vygotsky may have assented to both these propositions. However, to assent to both is not yet to commit oneself to a form of reductionism, since that would depend upon one's views about the relation between the two propositions, which remains to be elucidated. 34 Vygotsky's views about the social origin of the higher mental functions has greatly influenced certain strands of philosophical thought in the USSR. Some philosophers have argued that such a position must form the core of a Marxist theory of the person (liZnosf), as a way of giving sense to the sixth "thesis on Feuerbach": "... the human essence is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In its reality it is the ensemble of social relations," (Marx and Engels, op. cit., p. 29.) See E. V. Il'enkov, 'Cto ze takoe licnost', in S ceg? nahnaetsa l??nost'1, 2nd ed., Moscow, Politizdat, 1984, pp. 323? 358, and F. T. Mikhailov, The Riddle of the Self, Moscow, Progress, 1980. 35 Wittgenstein develops his attack in several works. See especially, Philosophical Inves tigations, Oxford, Basil Blackwell, 1953. The literature on the 'private-language argu ment' and the 'rule-following considerations' is immense. I discuss the relevance of Wittgenstein's strategy to the work of F. T. Mikhailov, a philosopher much influenced by Vygotsky, in my 'Action, Epistemology and The Riddle of the Self, Studies in Soviet Thought 24 (1982), pp. 185-209. 36 Readers unfamiliar with this problematic should consult Simon Blackburn's introduc tion to the philosophy of language, Spreading the Word, (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1984), especially Ch. 2. 37 See Thought and Language, Ch. 2 and Ch. 1, Sec. III. Vygotsky's inventive use of experiment to establish his points is a most important aspect of his work which has been neglected in this presentation of his position. There is certainly a space in the literature for a discussion of his experimental methods which are often considered odd. Their strangeness originates in part in Vygotsky's denial that psychology proceeds exclusively by empirical generalisation. Distrustful of the idea that to discern a pattern in a particular case the psychologist must have recourse to a large number of cases, Vygotsky often proceeded from very small samples or single case studies. Despite Vygotsky's distinterest in the careful documentation of his experimental results, he is an ingenious experimenter. He draws the web of theory and experiment so tight, and his hypotheses are often so plausible, that the reader frequently has to remind himself that we are not conducting a compelling thought experiment, but refering to the results of actual tests.</page><page sequence="27">VYGOTSKY'S MYSLENIE I REC' 129 38 Ibid., p. 149. 39 Ibid.,p. 145. 40 Ibid., p. 146. 41 See Vygotsky's Psychology of Art. 42 Thought and Language, p. 149. 43 /?ztf., pp. 149-50. 44 Wittgenstein, op. cit., para. 124. 45 Vygotsky's writings on defectology have been collected for the first time in his Sobranie Solinenij, Vol. 5, (Moscow, Pedagogika, 1983). Vygotsky's passionate search to make psychology a tool of progress can be seen in the work of his disciples: in Luria's clinical psychology, Davydov's educational psychology and Me"s?erjakov's work on the teaching of blind-deaf mutes. (See Levitin's One Is Not Born a Personality.) MeScerjakov's work is little known in the West and deserves serious attention. His (rather dry) doctoral dissertation is published as Awakening to Life, (Moscow, Progress, 1979). The philoso phers Mikhailov and Il'enkov were closely involved in this work with the blind-deaf. (See E. V. Il'enkov, 'Stanovlenie licnosti: k itogam nau?nogo ?ksperimenta', in Kom munist, (1977, No. 2), pp. 68-79; F. T. Mikhailov op. cit. pp. 250-266; E. V. Il'enkov and G. C. Gurgenidze (with contributions from blind-deaf students), 'VydajuSeeesa dostizenie sovetskoj nauki', in Voprosy filosofli, (1975, No. 6), pp. 63-84; see also the symposium on the significance of Soviet work on the education of the blind-deaf with contributions by A. I. MeS?erjakov, E. V. Il'enkov and A. A. Malinovsky, in Priroda, (1970, No. 1, pp. 78-95.)) Until his recent move to Moscow's Institute of Philosophy, Mikhailov led a 'laboratory' in the Institute of General and Pedagogical Psychology, Moscow, which was devoted to continuing Mesfcerjakov's theoretical work. Several of the blind-deaf children MeScerjakov describes in Awakening to Life are now research workers at the latter Institute. One of them, A. V. Suvorov, has recently contributed an interest ing article on the development of the imagination of blind-deaf children to Voprosy Psikhologiv. 'Problema formirovanija voobrazenija u slepoglukhonemykh detej' (Voprosy Psikhologii, 1983, No. 3, pp. 62-72). 46 This paper was much improved by discussions with V. S. Bibler, Stephen Blacklocks, V.
