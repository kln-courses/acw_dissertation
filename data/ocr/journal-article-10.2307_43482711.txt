<plain_text><page sequence="1">Egyptian and Ancient Near Eastern Art Two anthropomorphic vessels Egypt, Middle Kingdom, ca. 1900-1700 B.C.; ceramic, h. 67/s and 77/s in. (17.5 and 20 cm.) William Stevenson Smith Fund. 1983.153,154 The tradition of anthropomorphic pottery, which first appeared in the Predynastic period, contin- ues to the very end of Dynastic Egypt and into the Roman period. These two somewhat amus- ing vessels are nonfunctional, since the opening is at the base and the arms cannot have served conveniently as handles. Like examples exca- vated at Dendera, they may be conveniently designated as mourning pots. The attitude of the hands raised to the head or face is an Egyp- tian convention for the expression of grief and occurs in many scenes of funerals. Similar ves- sels are in the Cairo and Turin Museums. The sophistication of Hittite ceramics is evident in this remarkable amphora. Classic features include the partial slip, the massive loop handle, and the use of appliqu√© decoration. The highly burnished red slip is a hallmark of Anatolian lux- ury wares. The applied roundels on this piece represent the Hittite royal insignia, a star with both straight and sinuous lines radiating from the center. The roundel may originally have been gilded. Hittite amphora Anatolia, ca. 1800 B.C.; ceramic, h. 191A in. (49 cm.)

Egyptian Special Purchase Fund. 1982.501 Private sculpture of the Second Intermediate Period, rarely represented in museum collec- tions, is insufficiently recognized and identified. The seated statuette of the great priest Khety is closer to the traditions of the late Middle King- dom in the gaunt structure of the face, the rather artificial wrinkles on the forehead, and the marked naso-labial furrow. These conven- tions and the folds of flesh on the torso, indicat- ing maturity and well-being, have now become stock features with little originality. The heavy seat in one piece with the base and the rather stolid set of the sandaled feet are typical of the later Second Intermediate Period. 25</page></plain_text>
