<plain_text><page sequence="1">Live from the Hong Kong Nile Club. Poems: 1975-1990 by August Kleinzahler. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2000. $15.00 ISBN 0374527016 (paper). The 25-40 year old August Kleinzahler of these poems, essentially continuous with the poet that we know today, already shows a dazzling mastery of Imagist "painting with words." The selections are drawn from a few long-out-of-print volumes, and instead of being arranged traditionally "by book," come divided into two large groups by coast?"East" and "West." While one is struck by the laconic spareness of some of these poems compared to the recent work, their minimaUsm hides a compressed exuberance. A high density of thought and a persuasive earthiness of tone are aided by the frequent choice of short, chiefly monosyllabic words. The verbal economy gives freedom to a memorable, image-drunk voice. Consistent with the poet's education, his early style is at times exquisitely imbued with dictions borrowed from the Far East, but retains enough melancholy to dispel any suspicions of Zen-clarity, as in this haiku like stanza: "A cruel word at eventide / and night zips up / like a spider's retreat." The writing is experimental, full-blooded, and rooted in life experi ence. It reveals life's raw, harsh beauty. This is a lyric poetry, peculiar in its self estranged insight that "the ego is a ghost ship." Its subject-matter is "self" rather than "the self," experience rather than identity. An implicit Machism is at work behind the scenes?a monistic metaphysic which takes experience to be the only substance, thus eliminating the boundary between the self and the world. Experience is captured in clusters of vivid and often disjoint, montage like images which combine into subjective portraits of moments in the 752 Harvard Review</page><page sequence="2">universal flux. Kleinzahler's poetic vision is often fractured, yet largely retains a powerful hoUstic coherence because it posits meaningful continuities in nature, where " spirit and flesh played blithely in each other's yard. " The mind is mixed with the body and the body with the world, which is itself perceived in terms of the body?of its various parts, hair, fluids?all purified by the imagination and elevated to the status of empirical abstraction. There are many vivid anthropomorphic portraits of weather and landscape; the texture of some verses has the crunchiness of fresh snow. Kleinzahler is obsessed with the organic, mortal stuff of Ufe. "Storm over Hackensack" begins: "This angry bruise about to burst / on City HaU / wUl spend itself fast / so fluid and heat may buUd again." But the poem itself "builds" toward a sublime telos: "This is the gods' perpetual Ught: / clarity / jeopardy / change." In Kleinzahler's anthropomorphic aesthetics, experience supphes not only the subject-matter but also the poetic method itself, which is at once somatic and cosmic, solemn and ironic: "the Mind is a too much thing / cleansing itself Uke a great salt sea." The whole tenor of the volume works against the postmodern "dissociation of sensibiUty." Poetic language recon stitutes the meaningful oneness of perception while coloring it in turn with its own materiaUty. Perception is mixed with language, and reality is style all along the zigzag from Jersey City to San Francisco. Finally, the self is continuous through empathy with other selves. Kleinzahler portrays people very memorably. In "Where Galuccio Lived," an old Italian is characterized tragicaUy through a description of his abode, vacated by death and now being renovated. Galuccio's painful loneliness, old age, and even the fact of his death are all unambiguously implied by the anthropomorphic apartment, but never referred to explicitly. The only thing mentioned about Galuccio himself is that he had a "busted leg." Many of these "early selected" poems have a Dostoyevskian depth, and all invite multiple readings.
