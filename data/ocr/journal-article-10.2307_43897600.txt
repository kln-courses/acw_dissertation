André WEGENER SLEESWYK SYNOPSIS. According to the Chinese historiography of the Sung -dynasty the courtiers Yen- Su and Wu Tê- jen constructed south-pointing chariots of which brief descriptions exist. The long-standing problem of reconstructing these chariots is attacked anew by a method which combines analyses of the text, engineering considerations and elementary algebraic geometry. The latter is used first to derive the requirements of geometry for successfully working south-pointing chariots, and subsequently to show that the south-pointing mechanism in Yen- Su' s chariot must have been a special type of intermittently working gear assembly. The historical text combined with the requirements of engineering leads to a reconstruction in which an escapement lever synchronizes two gears. The reconstruction of the Wu Tê-jen's chariot starts from the assumpt- ion - based on the symmetry of the assembly - that two differential gears were used. The gears may then be assembled in 15 different ways to construct south- pointing mechanism. Using algebraic geometry again, the required track-width of the chariots incorporating these 15 gear assemblies are calculated and compared with the known width of the body of the chariot. In only three instances are the two widths approximately equal; of these three, one is to be preferred on grounds of adherence to the text and good engineering. The text is too brief that more than part of the mechanism which actuated jackwork in Wu Te-jen's chariot can be reconstructed. Without using elementary algebraic geometry it is impossible to limit sufficiently the number of possible reconstructions, but analysis of the texts, intuition and engineering knowledge are essential too. The results show that: in the reconstruction of Yen Su' s chariot engineering requirements and the historical text lead to a reconstruction in which an escapement is employed, 60 years before Su Sung used an escapement in the construction of his famous 'Heavenly Clockwork'; Lanchester's intuition (emphatically not based on documentary evidence I) that differential gearing was involved in the south-pointing mechanisms is con- firmed for Wu Tê-jen's chariot. It is not improbable that the use of differential gearing in Europe was a transmission from China.

These two descriptions refer to chariots constructed in AD 1027 and AD 1107 d e by the court engineers Yen Su and Wu Te- jen respectively. They include specifications of the gears employed and brief indications of their mode of operation. On top of these chariots stood the anthropomorphic figure of a hsien^, i.e. an immortal, which always pointed southwards even though the horse-drawn chariot turned around. It is clear from these descriptions that the hsięn stood on top of a shaft which was rotated automatically by means of a gear train connecting the shaft to the rotations of the two road wheels of the chariots in such a manner that the hsien always pointed in the same direction. Several reconstructions have been proposed, of which the most important appear to be those of Moule (1925)2, Wang Chen-to^ (1937) 3 , Lanches ter (1947) 4 and Pao Ssu-ho^ (1948) 5 . The reconstructions of Moule, Wang and Pao seem to be based on Hopkinsonłs6 remark (1909) that some mechanism would have been required to ensure that the gears connected to the chariot wheels at right and left were engaged or disengaged when the chariot turned right or left. The coupling mechanisms in the various reconstructions would all have been actuated by a slight rotation in the horizontal plane of the pole relative to the body of the chariot, but Needham7, following Lanchester, is of the opinion that they never would have worked properly. In the quantitative analysis given below, it will be shown that the operating conditions for mechanisms based on this principle are indeed so restrictive as to render their satisfactory operation a practical impossibility. A reconstruction which is based on a different mechanical principle of great technological interest is Lanchester1 s model, showing that if the gear train included a differential gear the desired rotation 1. The §ung_Shih was written under the Yuan by T'o-T'o (Toktaga) and Ouyang Hs'uanc c. 1345. Excerpts from this work were used in.. the translation by J. Needham in his monumental work Science_and_Civilisat- ion_in_China (Referred to in the following as Needham) (Vol. IV: 2 Cambridge Ī965, p. 286 ff.). 2. The Rev. A. C. Moule published the full Chinese text of the §ung_Shih concerning the two south-pointing chariots with translations.

Unfortunately, however, he dismissed the description of Yen Su' s chariot as uninte] ligible and deliberately deceptive, while he does not appear to have considered the description of the other chariot, although it was mentioned by Moule8 in his discussion of the differential gear model appended to Lanchesterfs description. As a result, this model does not in any way correspond to the specifications of the gear trains of the two chariots in the Sung_Shih. Consequently, it cannot truly be said that either of the two chariots has been successfully reconstructed. This is the more to be regretted because it would be of great interest to the history of technology if it could be shown indubitably that Lanchesterfs assumption was correct, and that the differential gear was known to the engineers of the northern Sung dynasty. That would not have been improbable at all, as at the same court and in the same period Su Sung 's water wheel clock was constructed (AD 1088), employing the equally 3. Wang Chen- to.

The discussion of the gearing in the upper storey is a valuable contribution. Professor Sivin drew my attention to this work and kindly translated essential fragments. K'o-Hsüehm. Peking (1962). 6. H. Giles, who produced the first translation of the description of Yen Sufs chariot, submitted it to Professor B. Hopkinson. The latter thought that it was 'extremely improbable1 that the south-pointing chariot was a magnetic device, as was thought before that time. He could not, however, re- construct the chariot from the description. His letter is quoted in full in H. Giles, Adversaria Sinica No. 7, p. 219-222, Kelley and Walsh, Shanghai (1909). 7. Needham, p. 295-296, remarks that the reconstructions of Moule and Wang are 'hardly workable'. He continues: "Moule always dismissed such arguments by saying that the machine was never intended to serve any practical purpose, but even if, as is possible, it was primarily a symbolic imperial prestige gadget, there is no reason to assume that it never worked properly. ' 8. Moule was 'asked to add something about the Chinese side' of Lanchester's solution and makes it clear that to the sinologist the problem was not solved yet, in spite of Lanchester's brilliant contribution.</page><page sequence="4">SLEESWYK 7 ingenious principle of the clockwork escapement which had been known since I-hsing's11 clock of AD 725. But as it was, one could only concur with Moule * ... that there is no indication that the Chinese, though no proof that they did not, find and lose the principle of the differential gear f . (The wording is Moule łs). The aim of the present investigation was to try to remedy this disappointing state of affairs by analysing the texts carefully from the point of view of the engineer who would want to use the descriptions as guides for reconstructing these ingenious mechanisms with the technology and workmanship available to medieval Chinese courtiers. The interest of the study not only rests on the finding that, in fact, the description of Wu Tê- jen' s south-pointing chariot does specify in precise detail the differential gearing employed, but also on the conclusion that the essential part of Yen Su' s chariot could have been a simple form of escapement mechanism. The analysis can only be followed if the text to which it is applied is quoted in full. The translation is essentially that of Moule; Needham' s more modern phrasing is occasionally used. A few of the interpolations by Moule and Needham are retained in parentheses. In what follows, variations on the translations are given in brackets; those by Needham are preceded by N:, those by Sivin by S:9. The lettering of the wheels and the vertical shaft at the beginning of the sentences in which they are mentioned, as introduced by Moule2, is retained. The basic part of the description of Yen Su' s chariot is given in the Sung_Shih as follows: 'The method involves using a carriage with a single pole ļ^uan°ļ. Above the outside framework of the body of the carriage let there be a cover in two storeys. Set a wooden image of a hsien at the top, stretching out its arm to indicate the south. Use 9 wheels of various sizes with a total of 120 teeth: (A) 2 foot-wheels (i.e. road wheels, on which the carriage runs), 6 ft. high and 18 ft. in circum- ference, (B) attached to the feet, 2 vertical subordinate wheels, 2.4 ft. in diameter and 7.2 ft. in circumference, each with 24 teeth, the teeth being at intervals of 3 inches apart, 9. The alternative translations of crucial sentences by Professor Sivin were an invaluable aid in gaining an insight into the latitude and constraints that the original imposes on a reconstruction. The foot that the text refers to must have been the standard Sung foot of 30.72 cm, which was subdivided in 10 inches.</page><page sequence="5">8 (E) below the cross bar ih§ng_mul?2 at the end of the pole two vertical small wheels 3 inches in diameter and pierced by an iron axle [S: iron axles] , (D) to the left 1 small horizontal wheel, 1.2 ft. in diameter with 12 teeth, and to the right 1 small horizontal wheel, 1.2 ft. in diameter and with 12 teeth, (C) in the middle 1 large horizontal wheel of 4.8 ft. diameter and 14.4 circumference, with 48 teeth, the teeth at intervals of 3 inches apart, (V) in the middle a vertical shaft piercing the centre (of the large horizontal wheel) 8 ft. high and 3 inches in diameter at the top carrying the wooden figure of the hsien. f The gist of the functioning of these gears was reported as follows: 'When the carriage moves (southward) let the wooden figure point south. When it turns (and goes) eastwards, the (back end of the) pole is pushed to the right; the subordinate wheel attached to the right road wheel will turn forward 12 teeth, drawing with it the right small horizontal wheel one revolution (and so) pushing [ S: contacting] the central large horizontal wheel to revolve [ S: which revolves] a quarter turn to the left. When it has turned around 12 teeth, the carriage moves eastwards, and the wooden figure stands crosswise and points south...1 So much for Yen Su 's chariot. The description of Wu Te- jen' s larger carriage runs: 'The body of the south-pointing carriage was 11.15 ft. (long), 9.5 ft. wide, and 10.9 ft. deep. (A) The carriage wheels were 5.7 ft. in diameter, the carriage pole 10.5 ft. long, and the carriage body in two storeys, upper and lower. In the middle was placed a partition. Above there stood a figure of a hsien holding a rod, on the left and right were tortoises and cranes, one each on either side, and four figures of boys each holding a tassel. In the upper storey was arranged a mechanism of 13 horizontal gears [N: In the upper storey there were at the four corners trip-mechanisms ikuan-li^ ^Presumab l^_t° actuate_the_boYS_to_wave_their_tasselsJL_Footnote_b^_Needham_12 and also 13 horizontal wheels ] .

A central shaft, following the partition, pierced downwards . (C) In the lower storey were 13 wheels.

(D) Reaching [S: connected] to the top left and right, were two small horizontal wheels which could rise and fall, having an iron weight (attached to) each. Each of these was 1.1 ft. in diameter and 3.3 ft. in circumference, with 17 teeth, at intervals of 1.9 inches apart. (B) Again, to left and right, were attached wheels, one on each side, in diameter 1.55 ft., in circumference 4.65 ft., and having 24 teeth, at intervals of 2.1 inches.</page><page sequence="6">SLEESWYK 9 (F, G) Left and right, too, were double gear-wheels, a pair on either side. Each of the lower component gears was 2.1 ft. in diameter and 6.3 ft. in circumference, with 32 teeth, at intervals of 2.1 inches apart. Each of the upper component gears was 1.2 ft. in diameter and 3.6 ft. in circumference, with 32 teeth, at intervals of 1.1 inches apart. (H) Above each of the feet of the carriage, left and right, [N: On each of the road-wheels of the carriage, left and right] was a vertical wheel 2.2 ft. in diameter, 6.6 ft. in circumference, with 32 teeth at intervals of 2.25 inches apart. (E) The left and right back poles each had a small wheel without teeth (pulleys), from which hung bamboo cords, and both were tied above the left and right axle (respectively). [ S: Affixed there are bamboo cords, also bound on the left and right axles. ] If the carriage turns to the left, it causes the small wheel on the right pole to let down [S: drop down toward] the right-hand wheel. If it turns to the left, it causes the small wheel on the left pole to let down [S: drop down toward] the left wheel. When the carriage moves then the hsien and the boys stand crosswise and point south.1 The scene is now set for a confrontation of those descriptions with the requirements of elementary geometry and mechanics. What precisely is required of the gearing for it to function successfully, and how do the descriptions tally with these requirements? What clues are hidden in the details of the text? How do the various dimensions of the parts, and the proposed assemblies of these parts tally with one another and fit together? It is questions of this kind that will now be discussed. A measure of knowledge of the quantitative relationship between the angle of rotation co^ of the south-pointing immortal relative to the chariot, and the angles of rotation of the road wheels at right, and at left, which would be implied by successful operation is indispensable for judging re- constructions of south-pointing carriages. When the chariot turns around it displaces itself and it rotates in the horizontal plane; if the pole is taken as a pointer, successful operation of the device is achieved when the rotation of the chariot pole, is just compensated for by or: (DC = - (Dp (1) The geometry of the cart and its track when the latter describes a curve of constant radius R is illustrated in fig. 1 . It leads to the equalities : ^VR*0 = ü)p ÍR+ ^ T'' (2a)</page><page sequence="7">10 Figi and: u^.D = wp (R - J T) . (2b) Subtracting eq. (2b) from eq.(2a) and rearranging, the expression: "P = T H/R " "W ^ is obtained. It thus appears that the geometry of the chariot and the road wheel rotations contain the necessary information for correctly turning the immortal; the value of the radius of curvature R is not needed for that. If only one of the wheels is connected to the south-pointing hsieņ, e.g. the right wheel during a left turn or the left wheel during a right turn, as in the reconstructions of Wang, Moule and Pao, the correct operating condition is easily obtained from these elementary equations. Suppose that only the rotation of the right road wheel is transmitted, resulting in a rotation of the hsien proportional to or: «e = - a*a)^R (where a is a proportionality factor), (4) it then follows from the equations (1), (2a) and (4) that: R = J - i T. (5)</page><page sequence="8">SLEESWYK 11 For given chariot dimensions and gearing all the values in the right- hand side of eq. (5) are constants, i.e. R must be a constant: a mechanism of this type would function properly only if the chariot could be driven through turns of a fixed radius. As it is highly improbable that this could be achieved successfully with a two-wheeled vehicle, we must concur with Lanchester that these reconstructions would not have worked satisfactorily. The error would have shown up very quickly for curves of large radii. As mentioned before, Lanchester demonstrated that a correctly functioning mechanism could be obtained by using differential gearing, but his reconstruction does not at all correspond to either of the two descriptions in the Sung_Shih, because he decided 'to ignore the specific- ation and work out the problem from its elementary principles'. Differential gearing essentially consists of one or more idler gears enmeshing at right angles with two equal and co-axially mounted gears (fig. 2). It is easily established that irrespective of the size Fig 2 or number of teeth of these gear wheels, the shaft carrying the arm on which the idler is mounted rotates at a speed which is the average of the rotational velocities of the gears between which the idler runs, i.e.: 0) +0J »S = "V1 ^ (It may be noted that 'averager' would be a better term than 'differential', but if w ļ and &lt;d2 are taken in opposite sense, ujg is equal to half the difference between ul and u)2).

(6) conforms to both eq. (3) and eq. (1). S is then the vertical shaft, and 1_ and 2 are then horizontal gears. However, two horizontal central gears is a feature absent from both Yen Su 's and Wu Te-jen's specifications. That in other respects Lanchester's reconstruction cannot be valid is most obvious for Yen Su' s chariot: besides the subordinate gear wheels attached to the road wheels there are only- two small horizontal gears present, one on each side, and one large horizontal gear in the middle carrying the vertical shaft on which the south-pointing immortal stands. It is not possible to assemble a differential gear train from these three horizontal gears. Moreover, eq. (6) cannot be reconciled with the very explicit description of the functioning of Yen Su 's mechanism in the Sung_Shih, where it is stated that a rotation of a subordinate gear over 12 teeth causes the central wheel attached to the shaft on which the hsien stands to rotate over the same number of teeth, instead of half that number. It can only be concluded that neither the possible arrangements of the small number of gears, nor their described modus_operandi would justify a reconstruction on the basis of differential gearing. Yen_ Su^s_chariot The few, but essential, facts that can be deduced from the description in the Sung_Shih concerning the functioning of the gear mechanism of Yen Su1 s chariot are conveniently presented in the form of simple equations. From the text it follows that wp=wwR~ij%j i-n ecl* (3)&gt; or: T « D, (8) i.e. the track width is 6 ft.. Furthermore, if v^, vL and v^ are the circumferential velocities of the central gear C, the gear B at left and the gear B at right, respectively, the description may be given in a more general form as: VC = VR - VL. (9)</page><page sequence="10">SLEESWYK 13 The gears D cannot engage the gear C and both gears B permanently, unless the chariot would only pivot around a central vertical axis. Other- wise the gears D have to transmit the rotations vR and v^ intermittently to the central gear, by means of a mechanism of which the gears E presumably form part. However, even if the gears D only temporarily transmit the rotations of the gears B to the gear C, they need an additional degree of freedom of motion in the horizontal plane to compensate for the difference in the rotational velocities v^ and v^. Superimposed on the rotation of each gear D must be a translation movement. In order better to understand the action of a gear moving in its plane while meshing with another gear, we consider it to be essentially a wheel rolling without slipping over a moving surface, as depicted in fig. 3. The circumferential velocity v3 parallel to v2 is the sum of the Fig 3 velocities that would result if either vi or v2 were equal to zero: v3 = 2vļ - v2. (10) If the similar action of a gear D engaged to the central gear C is considered, all circumferential gear velocities in the mechanism can be calculated using eq. (10). For example, if the gears D driving the gear C are themselves driven by the gears B and perform translation movements with a velocity vD which has been chosen as equal at right and left, application of eq. (10) with: at right: vx = vD ; v2 = vc ; v3 = vR , at left : vx = vD ; v2 = -vc ; v3 = vL , results in the equations: VC = VR - 2vD</page><page sequence="11">14 VC = 2vD * VL ' from which it immediately follows that: VR+VI vD = -Vk, VR+VI (11a) and: VD~VT vc=-Vt. (11b) The gears D can only move a limited distance with the velocity v^; as indicated before, they have to be reset periodically in their original positions. This can be achieved by 'jumping a tooth', i.e. by disengagement of the gear which allows it to rotate one tooth backwards relative to the gear it was meshing with previously. Comparison between the required rotation of the central gear - eq. (9) - and the one produced by the hypothetical mechanism while the gears are engaged - eq. (11b) - shows that the latter is only half the required value. There is no simple mechanical system conceivable that would furnish the missing half of the rotation when the gears D are reset: the conclusion can only be that the postulated mechanism is not a valid reconstruction. To have Vj of opposite sign at left and right - which would require a very sinopie mechanical construction - is impossible, because that would result in the requirement: vT L = - vD, L K as follows immediately fron eq. (10). One conclusion is that the translation movements of the gears D are independent. Moreover, it can be deduced from eq. (11) that the required velocity of the gear C can only be obtained by transmitting the circumferential velocities of the gears B to the gears D as velocities of translation rather than circumferential velocities; we thus obtain: at right: vx = vR ; v2 = vc ; v3 = vD , at left : Vļ = vL ; v2 = - vc; v3 = vD , where v^ is now the common circumferential velocity of the gears D. They must have this velocity in common, because otherwise there would be too many free variables in the mechanical system. The result is now: VD = VR + VL ' and: (12) VC = VR * VL « The resulting rotation of the central gear is now indeed in accord with the requirement formulated in eq. (9) .</page><page sequence="12">SLEESWYK 15 Quantitative elementary geometry thus dictates the somewhat un- expected principle of the reconstruction, viz. that the gears D ate not driven circumferentially by the gears B but that the centres of the gears D are displaced by the gears B. Periodically, the gears D have to be re- positioned. The time needed for these resettings should be negligible in conpari son to the time that the gears are engaged. In the reconstruction which has been worked out on the basis of this principle the two resettings take place simultaneously, and under action of a released spring. A moot point is that this proposed resetting mechanism is not mentioned in the Sung_Shih; it is merely a consequence of the geometrical requirements derived from the text. The latter is too brief possibly to be a full description, so inevitably, in any reconstruction, elements will be present that are not to be found in the original text. Fig 4 On the other hand, every part described in the text must be considered essential to the functioning of the mechanism. What method or means were employed to obtain the required equality of the velocities vß at right and left? The Suņg Shih text would not allow any gears for it, but mentions the small wheels E and the h|ng_mu cross bar or 'transverse wood* (Moule). These could, in fact, have served for that purpose. Two face gears can be synchronized by means of a see- sawing cross bar or lever. The principle is illustrated in fig. 4, where a balancing lever and two gears are depicted. The ends of the lever are knife edges resting on the teeth of two face gears. The heights under the knife edges at right and left, h^ and h^ respectively, have a constant average, h^. Only when the value of h^ or h^ reaches its maximum can a tooth of the gear on that side pass underneath it. If the lever oscillates between the two extremum positions, the same number of teeth will pass underneath the knife edges at right and left in a given span of time i.e.</page><page sequence="13">16 the two gears are synchronized. The mechanical arrangement constitutes a special type of escape- ment, because the gears can only rotate as long as the balancing lever oscillates. If the average height of the teeth under the knife edges is less than h^. the working of the escapement will not be impaired as long as the maximum height of the teeth exceeds h^y. If the escapement mechanism was used to synchronize the two gears D of Yen Su 's chariot, these gears would have been driven by a torque of considerable magnitude, resulting in relatively large forces on the lever. The use of knife edges would then have been impractical, causing high friction and wear. Technically it would be advantageous to replace the knife edges by small wheels rolling over the teeth of the two gears. Thus, the two gears would have been synchronized by a balancing lever under which two small wheels were mounted; that would fit the description in the §ung_Shih remarkably well. Accordingly, such wheels are incorporated in the proposed reconstruction (they are indicated by 'E' in fig. 6). Although the dimensions of the gears as given in this description can only be approximate, it is obvious that between the gear C and the road wheels - according to eq. (8) mounted at a distance of 6 ft. apart - there was not enough space to mount the gears D directly above the wheel axles. The fact that a gear D meshed with the gear C caused the distance between the axes of the gears to be somewhat less than the sum of the outer radii, say 2.75 instead of 3.0 ft.. If the gears D were mounted 1.65 ft. to the rear of the wheel axles, the distance between the axes of the gears D would have been 4.4 ft.. The total width of the gear assembly would have been 5.6 ft., and would just have fitted between the wheels of the carriage, while the addendum (outer diameter) circles of the three gears would have been tangent to a line situated 2.4 ft. behind the axles. The elegant compactness of the arrangement would seem a point in its favour. Although the periodic resetting of the gears D is a necessary consequence of the principle of the reconstruction, it remains hypothetical, and the mechanism for it outlined below is merely presented to enable the system, as embodied in a complete model, to be easily judged on its merits and weaknesses. It is assumed that the gears D are mounted on swivel arms pivoting around the central shaft V. These arms are pulled forward by the gears B, until at a certain point they are allowed to jump back one tooth on the gear,</page><page sequence="14">SLEESWYK 17 after which they are pulled forward again, etc. . A plausible way of obtaining the effect is by having the swivel arm set back by a spring - e.g. made of bamboo - and by letting the connection between the swivel arm and the gear B be made by a hooked pull rod, which is released at a point determined by the geometry of the mechanism. In fig. 5 a possible arrangement is depicted. When the pull rod is released, the gear D has to be disengaged simultaneously from the central gear C. An obvious way to obtain this is to use the force exerted by the gear B on the pull rod to engage the gear D with the gear C. When the pull rod is released the force falls away and the gears disengage. Fig 5 Fig 6 In the reconstruction of the chariot shown in fig. 6 the proper action of the mechanism is obtained by interposing a link between the swivel arms and the gears D. The principle of the device is frequently employed in various forms in ratchet mechanisms in toys and simple tools. It follows from eq. (10) and the distances between teeth given in the §ung_Shih that the gears D jump back precisely two teeth on the gear C before engaging again. It may well be possible that a simpler device than that presented in fig. 6 could have produced the same action. This reconstruction is based on eq. (12) and the escapement mechanism utilized for synchronization given in fig. 4. Still, the precise form of the ratcheting mechanism, the teeth of</page><page sequence="15">18 the face gears D, etc. in fig. 6 are entirely conjectural and consequently of little importance. Wu_Te-len^s_chariot Although, as in Yen Su' s chariot, the absence of two central gears in the gear train in Wu Te- i en' s carriage precludes using the central differential gear envisaged by Lanchester, the greater number of gears in the gear train - five on each side next to the large central gear wheel - would allow different solutions. We shall enumerate a few details in the description of the gear train in the Sung_Shih, which, if taken together, point to an alternative in which two differential gears are employed. That, of course, still makes use of the basic idea put forward by Lanchester, viz. that some form of differential gearing must be involved . First: although it may be remarked, following Needham11, that the diameters and numbers of teeth of the gears do not appear to tally if these diameters are taken as pitch diameters, there is, in fact, no need for so under- standing them; if the gear diameters are taken as addendum- or outside diameters of the gears, the description can be strictly adhered to, as will be shown below. The various gears can then be roughly divided in two size categories of diametral pitch12 (DP): one category of wheels with DP equal to 0.35 to 0.40 inch (the large wheel C and the small component gears G of the double gear wheels) , and the category in which the remaining gears fall, with DP app. 0.6 inch. Consequently, in any reconstruction the gears G mesh with the central gear C. Secondly, it is notable that of the gears in the large DP category, two (F and H) possess the same number of teeth. Between these an idler gear might have run. Thirdly, that idler might have been the gear D. The rising and falling of that gear as described in the Sung_Shih text would then refer to its bobbing up and down when rotating between the two vertical gear wheels F and H. The iron weight would have served to counter-balance the rotating mass of the idler gear. 11. Needham, p. 473. 12. The pitch circles are the tangent circles rolling relative to each other that the gears may be considered to replace. Diametral pitch, DP = pitch circle dia. no. teeth</page><page sequence="16">SLEESWYK 19 Fig 7 Fig 8 If this interpretation is accepted, it must at the outset be remarked that in order to introduce the proper number of constraints in the system the two differential gear trains have to be interconnected. In principle this may be obtained in two different ways. In one solution the gears B mesh with the gears H - which have a slightly larger outside diameter than the gears F - and are mounted on an interconnecting shaft (fig. 7a) . In the other solution the gears B and D form double gears (this possibility cannot be excluded, because the gears G and H constitute such double gears, and these were, therefore, known) and together with the gear wheels G and H these can be assembled to form compound differential gear trains (fig. 7b) . The shaft interconnecting the two differential gears would then have to be co-axial with the wheel axles. With these gears, two types of compound differentials can be constructed, viz. one type in which the double idler gear is mounted on the same side of the rotating arm (type II in fig. 8), and another type where the two gears are mounted on opposite ends of the arm, which acts as an interconnecting axle (type III). Type I is the simple differential gear as sketched in fig. 2. The expressions giving the rotation of the</page><page sequence="17">20 shaft, Wg, in terms of the rotations of the gear wheels F and H are: type I : 2 Wg = Wp + (cf. eq. 6) (13a) type II : 41 Wg = 24 Up + 17 (13b) type III : 7 Wg = 24 cap - 17 (13c) In what follows it will be assumed that each of the three rotational exits of these differentials (i.e. the rotations of S, F and H) can be connected to either a road wheel, or the gear G which meshes with the central gear C, or the shaft interconnecting the differential gear trains. In some cases this may imply considerable emendation of the text, but it is, of course, desirable to completely explore the possibilities. It is easily established that there are 3 different ways thus to connect the symmetrical type I differential gear, and 6 ways of connecting the types II and III each, i.e. a total of 15 different arrangements. The most obvious selection criterion, which will be applied first, is the track width T. It follows from the equations (1) and (3) that for different gearing between the road wheels and the central gear different D/T ratios are required for the proper functioning of the south-pointing contrivance. As the wheel diameter is known to be 5.7 ft., it follows that for each of the 15 differential gear variants the required value of T can be calculated. The width of the carriage body is 9.5 ft., and clearly only values of T being approximately equal to that need be considered. It is convenient for the calculation to let the chariot pivot on one of its wheels, e.g. the left road wheel. Then the rotation of the pole Wp is related to by: Fig 9</page><page sequence="18">SLEESWYK 21 WC 8 Because the gear ratio of the wheels C and G is: ^ , the following expression is obtained for the track width: ^ T = ^#.D.- 16 . (14) 16 mGR ^WR The ratio is entirely determined by the differential gearing, and UGR with eq. (14) the value of T can be calculated. Consider, for example, a chariot with type II differentials, with F attached to G, and the gear H to the wheel W, and the differential gear shafts S at right and left connected to each other. Add subscripts fR' and 'L' to distinguish right and left, and again assume that the chariot turns on its left road wheel. Eq. (13b), when applied to the right and left differential gear trains, yields the expressions: 41 "SR = 24 WGR + 17 "WR ' "*'■ 41 WSL = 24 "GL * Because the wheels G drive the same gear at right angles at positions 180 apart, they rotate in opposite sense relative to each other, or: UGL = ~ UGR ' U&gt;WR 48 It follows from these equations that: - - s " T7 ' corresponds to: T = 25.2 ft. GR It need hardly be argued that this value is not compatible with the width of the chariot body of 9.5 ft. Similar calculations were carried out for the remaining 14 variants. The results are assembled in table I. The values of T in the table approaching the width of the chariot body are given in heavy type; only these will be considered in more detail. Further selection will be based on a detailed comparison with the text of the Sung Shih and on u&gt;W j . engineering criteria. Only the absolute values of - are presented j in G the table, because the sense of rotation of the central wheel can be selected easily by mounting the wheel C either above or below the gear G. If the former is necessary, it may imply that the central vertical shaft</page><page sequence="19">22 has to be set off slightly in order to avoid its interfering with the axle connecting the differentials, but this would have presented no problem with the simple pinwheel gears that were presumably used.

A difference would be that the sense of rotation of the gears G would be opposite in the two cases. The T - values concerned are 12.6 and 25.2 ft., and consequently, only the type III solution for T = 12.6 ft. will be discussed: thus, only one variant of each of the three types remains to be considered further after the first selection. The following table gives the various ways the differential gears in these three different arrangements are connected with their rotational exits to the road wheels, the gears G or to each other. It is envisaged that the interconnection of the differentials is realized in the manner shown in fig. 7, i.e. either co-axially or through the B-gears. It may immediately be remarked that for T = 12.6 ft. considerable emendation of the Sung-Shih text is implied, as the gears G are attached to H instead of F. This could be circumvented by interchanging the positions of the gears</page><page sequence="20">SLEESWYK 23 B and D in the double idler gear, but then the gear dimensions given in the text cannot be maintained. As the other two solutions do not require such textual changes, the arrangement for T = 12.6 ft. can be discarded: from the engineering point of view this arrangement does not offer advantages above the other two possibilities. That is obvious from table II, where it is shown that the road wheels in the type III solution are not directly- connected to the differential gear shafts S which are co-axial with the wheel axles. TABLE II T H'ff 1 * t y**6 connections interconnect ion (ft.) H'ff 1 * t y**6 road wheel gear G co- axial via gears B 12.6 III F H S 10.5 II S F H 8.9 I S F - H In the type II and I gear trains the gears F are attached to the gears G, as described in the Sung_Shih, and the road wheels are attached to the central shafts S of the differentials. In principle that arrangement could allow the wheel axles sufficient length to have leverage between a pair of bearings. The point is important, because it follows from eq. 3 that the accuracy of the south-pointing mechanism directly depends on the accuracy with which the ratio D/T, and hence T, is maintained. In the type II gearing the co-axial connecting shaft between the gears H interferes with the wheel axles, and renders an unwieldly rotating arm for the idler gears a necessity. Although a hollow interconnecting shaft might make long wheel axles a possibility, from the engineering point of view the comparative simplicity of the gearing in the type I solution is much to be preferred (fig. 9). The type I arrangement is therefore chosen on the grounds of its adherence to the text of the Sung_Shih, and the plausibility of the engineering design. Of course, this solution requires wheel bays to be provided in the chariot body, but that simple and commonplace requirement would have presented no obstacle to any cartwright. The position of the shaft connecting the gears B - indicated as the B-shaft in what follows - is not necessarily that above the wheel axles, as drawn in fig. 9. More probably the B-shaft bearings were attached to the framework constituting the bottom of the chariot body, which would make a position of that shaft behind the wheel axles more likely.</page><page sequence="21">24 The gear train requires three different diametral pitches to be employed, of which two are close together. In the reconstruction, as sketched in fig. 9, it has been assumed that all gears were either pin wheels or face gears. The addendum (outside) diameters of the radial gears should be equal to the pitch diameters plus a few times the diametral pitch. In the following table the DP' s have been chosen so as to adhere as closely as possible to the text of the Sung_Shih. TABLE III (dimensions in ft.) gear no. teeth DP pitch dia. addendum dia. (WT-J) B 24 0.062 1 .49 1.55 H 32 0.062 1 .99 2.2 H 32 0.057 1.82 2.2 D 17 0.057 0Š97 1.1 F 32 0.057 1.82 2.1 G 32 0.035 1.12 1.2 C 100 0.035 3.50 3.8 It may be observed that the relation between Wu Tê- jen' s gear diameters and the assumed pitch diameters would entirely justify regarding the former as precise specifications of the addendum diameters of these gears. It will now be shown that the same is true for the gears in the upper storey. The purpose of these 13 horizontal gears was clearly to transmit the rotation of the shaft on which the hsien stood to the figures of the tassel-holding boys, which pointed southwards too, according to the description. If the boys were standing at the corners of an oblong array with the hsien in the middle, as is not unlikely, the 13 gears might have been arranged as shown in fig. 10. If the gear diameters in the text are again regarded as addendum diameters, the pitch diameter would have been approximately equal to 1.7 f t . , corresponding to a DP value of 0.054 ft.. The outside dimensions of the whole array would then have been approximately 8.7 by 10.3 ft., which would have just fitted inside the</page><page sequence="22">SLEESWYK 25 Fłg 10 carriage body. This finding can be regarded as a confirmation of the proposed arrangement of these gears, and of the assumption that the gear diameters in the Sung_Shih refer to the addendum circles. If they are taken as pitch circle diameters, the gear assembly would have been 9.4 ft. wide at the very least which would have resulted in too close a fit. Liu Hsien-chou (loc. cit.) mentions two alternative conjectural arrangements, suggested by Pao Ssu-ho and Huang Hsi-kfair, in which the gear mechanism in the upper storey is used to make the crane (s) and tortoise (s) mentioned in the description point south too. In the arrangement proposed by Pao a crane on one side and a tortoise on the other are assumed, the central • gear drives 6 intermediate gears, and each of these drives a gear on which either a boy or an animal stands. In Huang's alternative a crane and a tor- toise are placed on each side, the central gear drives four intermediate gears, and each of these drives two gears. The main objection to these reconstructions is that although the hsien and the boys are mentioned as pointing south in the last sentence of the quotation from the Sung_Shih presented before, the crane and tortoise are conspicuously absent from this passage. In addition, the external dimens- ions of these gear assemblies do not bear an obvious relationship to the dimensions of the carriage body and do not place the boys on the four corners, as described in the Sung_Shih. The reconstruction outlined in fig. 10 is free from these objections. We do not know what role was reserved for the crane (s) and tortoise (s) so specifically mentioned in the Sung_Shih; perhaps they belonged to direction- indi eating jackwork - we shall presently see that the rope tackle</page><page sequence="23">26 mentioned in the description might have been used to move such jacks - but that is far from certain. The symbolic equation: the tortoise signifies slow- ness, the crane rapidity of motion, which would come naturally to western man, was probably alien to the Chinese of the period of the Sung dynasty. In that culture the two animals primarily symbolised longevity.13 Perhaps they were mentioned as being more than formal embellishments, or because they were represented by carved statuettes, as were the south-pointing hsien and the boys. This seems very probable from Sivin's alternative reading of the passage under E in the description of Wu Tê- jen' s chariot, which corrects a faulty punctuation in Moule's translation. The original places the crane and tortoise on top, with the hsien and the boys at the four corners, and not in the lower storey, as Moule1 s translation would allow. So much, then, for the cranes and tortoises. That the rope tackle could have served to indicate the direct- ion the chariot was turning to is supported by the following indications: the bamboo cord(s) were fastened to the left and right axles which rotated at different speeds when the carriage turned a corner; the use of bamboo rope in machinery of this size is unusual, but would be readily explained if the rope had to suffer much friction. In most direction- indicating mechanisms deriving their motion from the rotation of the axles that one can think of, friction is inevitable; for maximum effect, the changes in the indication of the direction should take place suddenly. Probably the kuan-li tripping mechanisms triggered off the sudden motion; Needham ' s suggestion that the boys waved their tassels points to the obvious function of these tassels: to draw attention to some specific function of the boys holding them, e.g. those boys that were standing on the side toward which the chariot was turning might have been raising a south-pointing arm. Mechanically, that would not have been difficult to arrange. In spite of these indications the arrangement and precise functioning of the rope tackle is not easily deduced from the sentence E and the one that follows it, even after applying Sivin's corrections. This part of the reconstruction remains more conjectural in nature than the foregoing. In addition, it will be a partial reconstruction only, as we really have no means of knowing what jackwork was used for indicating 13. Remark by Sivin.</page><page sequence="24">SLEESWYK 27 direction and also because the nature of the 'back poles1 does not emerge clearly, either from the text or from the various reconstructions attempted. It can be deduced frail the text with comparative certainty that at each side of the chariot the bamboo cord connected a pulley sheave to the wheel axle. Only above the large central wheel C might the cord plausibly have been attached to the axles; consequently, the pulleys were located above the gear assembly. The wheels toward which the pulleys 'drop down1 were probably the gears B, and these must have reached to a somewhat greater height - at least their radius of approximately 8 inches was added - than the wheel axles. The 'back poles' cannot have been below the pulleys, and they were, therefore, situated at a height exceeding that of the carriage pole by at least a foot. That would imply that the 'back poles' and the carriage pole were separate parts of the construction. But the use of the same character 'yuan' for these various poles strongly suggests otherwise. The dilemma cannot be resolved, because, concerning the function of the 'back poles,' we only know that the pulleys were attached to them, no more. For this reason it would seem best to present the reconstruction of the rope tackle only to the point where the pulleys are attached to the elusive 'back poles,' as in Fig. 11. Fig 11</page><page sequence="25">28 We remark that ropes slung around the wheel axles would have been drawn at different speeds if the carriage turned right or left. An endless bamboo cord - fabricated as a grommet or obtained by a long splice between the ends of a piece of rope - is taken 1 ' turn around each of the wheel axles, and goes through each of the suspended pulley blocks in the manner sketched in fig. 11. The distance the pulley blocks can be pulled downward is limited by some kind of mechanical constraint. In the figure the situation is illustrated when the carriage turns left. The right hand wheel axle rotates faster than its companion at tne left; as a result the pulley at the right is pulled down, while the one at the left goes up. If we assume that further downward motion of the right- hand pulley block is mechanically restrained, the bamboo cord must slip slightly over the wheel axles at a velocity that is intermediate between the circumferential velocities of the two wheel axles. If the chariot is driven on a straight course no such slip takes place, if it turns to the right, the situation with respect to fig. 11 is rapidly reversed, and slip will again occur when the pulley block at the left has been pulled down to its lowest position. Thus a relatively rapid change of direction indication is obtained. Using springs and tripping mechanisms this effect could have been enhanced considerably, and the time of the change could have been made independent of the speed with which the pulley blocks were drawn downward. The tackle would conform well to both the parts utilized and their action as described in the Sung_Shih. Possibly this large carriage had a box for the cartdriver. Yen Sufs chariot would have been too small for that, and probably the horses were only led during the processions in which the chariots were obliged to take part. As we shall show, Wu Te-jen's chariot could have been driven at higher speeds, and then the box would have been a necessity. The partition mentioned in the text may have been the rear wall of the box, hiding the central shaft from view. Some comment on the method employed in these reconstructions would sean appropriate, because the reasoning is based on assumed criteria that hithero remained implicit. First and foremost, every single statement contained in the description was thought to convey information essential to an understanding of how the mechanisms worked. The second assumption was that, given the principle of construction, the Sung engineers executed the design with minimal redundancy.</page><page sequence="26">SLEESWYK 29 It must immediately be added that the reconstructions do not fully adhere to these principles. This is true for Wu Te-jen's chariot, where the discription of the gear D was rather freely interpreted as that of an idler wheel of a differential. An excuse for doing so, apart from the fact that the reconstruction fits the remainder of the description as well as possible, is found in the consideration that the chronicler may well have been at a loss to describe adequately what appears to have been a newly invented - or reinvented - mechanical construction. To the novelty of the differential gear in Wu Te-jen's chariot points not only the absence of any prior mention of it in the Chinese literature and its absence in Yen Su' s chariot, but also the only obvious redundancy of design to be found in these carriages. The model of Lanchester achieves the same result as Wu Te-jen's construction with only one differential, instead of two interconnected ones. Even if it is assumed that the B- shaft, which rotated at a speed proportional to the average of the rotational speeds of the wheel axles, was needed to actuate a hodometer ( and there is no indication in the text that this was the case ) , the design of Lanchester must be regarded as more efficient than that of Wu Tê- jen. This redundancy in an otherwise carefully planned design is best explained by a lack of familiarity with the use of different- ial gearing . On the other hand, the sophistication of Wu Tê-jen's engineering is apparent from the fact that in his differentials a !hunting tooth1 was employed in the rapidly rotating idler gear, as in modern gear systems. This engineering stratagem aims at having relatively prime numbers of teeth on meshing gears, ensuring even wear of the gear teeth. The idler, carrying 17 teeth, meshed with two gears with 32 teeth each. For Yen Su 's chariot too, it is true that the reconstruction does not fully adhere to the rational principles sketched above. Here it is the paucity of described moving parts that forces a number of parts to be present in the reconstruction that are not mentioned in the Sung_Shih. However, these exceptions to the above-mentioned rules implicitly used in the reconstruction are few. Otherwise the rules are obeyed remark- ably well. In my view, adherence to them is the criterion by which to judge reconstructions from textual evidence. The reason for presenting the new reconstructions is that the earlier ones obey the rules to a lesser extent. It was already mentioned that Lanchester explicitly disregarded the descript- ion of the gearing, but to the reconstructions of Wu Te-Jen's chariot by</page><page sequence="27">30 Moule and Pao it must be objected that the proposed gear trains contain more gears than necessary for transmitting the rotations to the central gear. And, of course, the basic principle of design of these reconstructions is too primitive to allow the mechanisms to work properly, as pointed out before. It seems that this idea of transmitting the rotation of either the right-hand or the left-hand road wheel to the immortal depending on the direction to which the chariot is turning, used in all prior reconstructions except the one by Lanchester, can be traced to the following sentences of Hopkinson regarding Yen Su' s chariot (loc. cit.): The difficulty is the absence of any mechanism for throwing the wheels which are driven by the chariot-wheels into gear with the large horizontal wheel, carrying the figure. Some such mechanism would appear to be necessary, and it would have to come into action when the chariot turned and at no other time; for, if the chariot wheels were always interlocked with the horizontal wheel, it would not be possible for them to turn round. The clear formulation of the principle no doubt explains why it inspired so many reconstructions. It is regrettable that Hopkinson did not state the conditions that had to be fulfilled in order for reconstructions based on his postulated mechanism to work reasonably well. That would have led to the recognition that more viable solutions were needed. There can be no doubt that Yen Su' s chariot as reconstructed in the foregoing would have worked well only at low speeds. At higher speeds the large inertia of the escapement would have given rise to resetting times that were no longer negligibly small in comparison to the periods of time that the gears were engaged. That explains the need apparently felt by Wu Tê- jen to construct a south-pointing carriage based on an entirely different principle. Yen Su nevertheless had demonstrated that an exact solution to the problem of constructing a south-pointing chariot could be found in principle. That the method a s such was not unsound is suggested by a curious passage in Ch'en Shih-tao 'ss Çh^ eņjjou- shaņ chi t (literary collection of the Sung period) 1U : 'Yen Su ... tried making a south-pointing chariot but did not succeed. Going out, he noticed how when the chariots were racing, their doors moved, and he hit on the method. 1 14. Shih-yuan ts'ung-shu edition of 1914, 22: lb.</page><page sequence="28">SLEESWYK 31 We do not know precisely what it was in the movement of doors of racing chariots that inspired Yen Su. The doors may have been in the sides or in the back of the chariot; both positions were found in those chariots that had doors. The advantage of Wu Te-jenfs mechanism was that it worked continuously without any resetting, as was necessary in Yen Su!s south- pointing mechanism. Wu Te-jenłs chariot could, because of this, be driven at higher speeds. The gear teeth were very probably made of wood and it is therefore unlikely that this high-speed driving could have taken place during long periods, but there is no evidence that there was any need for that. Rather the contrary is true: after any prolonged drive of more than a mile or so the inevitable accumulated error of the south-pointing gadget would have been very mach in evidence, as was pointed out by Coales15. The mathematical analysis of the functioning of the described mechanisms very much limits the room available for speculation. The finding that no averaging of road wheel rotations would fit the described rotations of the gears in Yen Sufs chariot reduces the possibilities to a narrow class of mechanisms. The description mentions some parts that are not gears: these play an essential role in the reconstructed mechanism. A number of parts are entirely conjectural; although this is probably an inevitable consequence of the brevity of the description, it induces us to be cautious about accepting all details of this reconstruction. With the reconstruction of the south-pointing mechanism of Wu Tê-jenfs chariot we are on f inner ground. The one reconstruction that emerges from the rather exhaustive analysis fits the description of the gearing so well down to every detail that little doubt is left. The details which remain more or less obscure concern auxiliary gadgets that are not essential to the south-pointing mechanism. Within these restrictions it would seem that the two reconstructions are sufficiently based on textual and engineering evidence to be given credence. The question which then arises is how the reconstructed mechanisms compare with similar machinery already known from the history of engineering. Until now the oldest escapement mechanism documented in sufficient detail to allow a reconstruction was the one employed in Su Sung* s heavenly clock tower (AD 1088). The references in Chinese historical sources to earlier escapements constructed by the T'ang clockmakers, of which the first appears 15. J. Coales as cited in Needham, p. 299.</page><page sequence="29">32 to have been I-hsing (AD 725), are not precise enough for this purpose, although Needham claims that 'the reference to the checking linkwork is plain, the technical terms used being closely similar to those in the descriptions of the clock of Su Sung116. It is therefore not without interest that Yen Su 's escapement, which antedates that of Su Sung by more than 60 years, attests to the continuity of the use of the escapement mechanism in the period. It may be remarked that although Lanchesterłs reconstruction encouraged the hypothesis that differential gearing was used in the mechanism of the south-pointing chariot he did not intend a historical reconstruction. The reconstruction of Wu Te-jen's chariot presented here, although confirming Lanchester's idea that differential gearing was involved, should be more satisfactory from the historian's point of view. We know from Price's17 recent reconstruction of the Antikythera mechanism, an analog calender computer from c. 80 B.C., that the differential gear was used at the time by a Greek instrument maker. In the Western world the differential reappears much later in the globe clock made by the Kassel court clockmaker Eberhart Baldewein in 1575. In China differential gearing appears only with Wu Te- jen. I have given reasons to believe that he reinvented the mechanism, and that it was not, therefore, transmitted from Greece to China. It is not known whether the Renaissance differential represents a reinvention or knowledge transmitted from Greece or China. In China itself the art of making south-pointing carriages was subsequently lost: the last time they are mentioned in Chinese sources is in the Ku yii t'uu (Illustrated Record of Ancient Jade Objects) of AD 1341 18 . With it disappeared the knowledge and use of differential gearing in China. There is at present no evidence available that in the interval the Chinese invention of the differential gear was transmitted to Western Europe. The possibility cannot be ruled out, as the south-pointing chariots still existed during the rule of the Mongols, when contacts between China and the West were oy no means rare. The disappearance of the differential followed the collapse of the Sung rule in the north of China when the capital K'aifengv fell to the Chin Tartars in AD 1126. Of course, if the differential disappeared with the south- 16. Needham, p. 474. 17. Derek de Solla Price, "Gears from the Greeks. The Antikythera Mechanism - A Calendar Computer from ca. 80 B.C."

This is, in fact, corroborated by the fact that knowledge of the clockwork escapement was lost after this fateful event, as reported in the Sung_Shih at some length. It is described how later, when the remnant of the empire consolidated in the region south of Yangtse river, it was desired to construct a copy of the heavenly clockwork. In AD 1144 Su Sung 's son Su Hsix, who had escaped to the south, vainly searched the family papers for the design, without which the task could not be undertaken. After this, the philosopher Chu Hsi^ (AD 1130 to 1200) was equally unsuccessful when attempting a reconstruction. It seems that most of the achievements of the northern Sung in the sciences and in practical technology were conserved. Algebra and astronomy continued to flourish, and reached their zenith under the dynasties of the southern Sung and the Yuan. The crafts too, were continued at the same level. It was the early equivalent of instrumentmaking - which so much depends on the fragile tradition of cooperation between the scholar-designer and the skilled craftsman - that proved to be very vulnerable to the onslaught of the Chin rar tars. It seems that this type of cooperation, which is essential to the development of the natural sciences and engineering, disappeared from medieval Chinese civilisation. The fall of Kfaifèng must be regarded as a major disaster in the history of technology, if not of mankind.
