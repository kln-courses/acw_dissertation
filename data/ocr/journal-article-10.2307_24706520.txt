The brothers thereby retrospectively renamed the account of the Kingdom of Congo by Eduardo Lopez and Filippo Pigafetta, which they had published in 1598, as Volume I of a series that would cover Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. This new series, the first independent enter prise undertaken by the brothers, was the pendant to the Historia Indiae Occidentalis (hereafter the India Occidentalis series) on which they had been working, under their father's supervision, since 1590. In combination, the two series span what can be called the second non-European world, to dis tinguish it from the first non-European world of the Turkish Empire in the Middle East and North Africa. The series comprise logbooks and descriptive, narrative or expository texts, almost all of which had been published before, some very recently, others decades earlier. At first sight the series appear to have grown in the course of more than forty years of publication rather than to have been planned.1 Nevertheless, arguments can be adduced for regarding them as a coherent whole. In both cases one can recognise the urge to provide the fullest possible geographical coverage. This took place gradually in the India Occidentalis series: it opened with parts of the northeastern coast of Amer ica, followed by Brazil, Spanish America, especially Peru and Mexico, and finally the La Plata region, Tierra del Fuego and the Wild Coast. This more or less corresponded to America as the Europeans knew it. In 1601 a syn thetic work, José de Acosta's Historia naturaly moral de las Indias, provided a temporary conclusion to the India Occidentalis series as Volume IX. Lin schoten's Itinerario offered a general account of Asia in a single publication and was in its way a synthetic work, which definitely contributed to the fact that it was precisely this book that inaugurated the new India Orientalis series. In later volumes, Dutch travel accounts fill in Linschoten's survey of Asia with more detailed descriptions of Java, the Moluccas and Ceylon, while the description of the Gold Coast by Pieter de Marees supplements the earlier accounts of the Kingdom of Congo, Gabon and Mozambique.</page><page sequence="3">72 Ernst van den Boogaart By 1606, when Volume VIII seemed to mark the conclusion of the India Orientalis series, Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, at least those parts known to the Europeans, had received reasonable coverage. The texts from which these geographical surveys are compiled are very heterogeneous in both the India Occidentalis and the India Orientalis series. The two series therefore do not constitute a seamless geographical survey in the strict sense of the word. In both of them a shift can be detected from the description of countries and peoples to descriptions of the activities of Europeans in the second non European world. Whoever viewed geography as 'the eye of history', to use Ortelius' designation, would not have found this an inappropriate combina tion of disciplines. The series also have the reputation of being a Protestant compilation, the pendant to the earlier collections of travel accounts by Montalboddo and Ramusio, for whom the Catholic, Iberian overseas expansion to which the Italians had made a major contribution formed a self-evident frame work. The India Occidentalis series, on the other hand, commenced with the early English and French colonisation enterprises set up by Protestant nota bles such as Walter Raleigh and Gaspard de Coligny, and continued with the Protestant Hans Staden's captivity narrative and the Protestant adapta tion of Benzoni by Chauveton and of Acosta by Linschoten.3 The geograph ical horizon of this approach would have widened from 1598 on with the India Orientalis series. Since then both series consist almost entirely of works that closely followed the overseas expansion of two Protestant coun tries, The Netherlands and England, at the expense of the Iberian dual monarchy. The Protestant character of the series is not absolute. For exam ple, the description of Congo includes a eulogy of the Catholic mission, and several dedications to Catholic electors are not strictly compatible with a militant Protestant motivation. A more serious objection is the fact that no real research has been conducted on whether the India Occidentalis and India Orientalis series actually do present such a Protestant vision. Criticism of the Spanish Conquista and interest in the overseas expansion of the Dutch and the English do not necessarily imply a Protestant view of the native peoples of the second non-European world or of colonial expansion. All the same, there is something to be said for the view of the series by the De Brys as a comparative history of the Iberian colonial enterprise, on the one hand, and of English, French and Dutch imperialism, on the other. The striking role played by the illustrations in both series is another indication of adhesion to a plan that had been formulated in advance. Not only are almost all of the volumes of the India Occidentalis and India Orien talis series that were published before 1606 richly illustrated, but virtually every one of them has a separate section with its own frontispiece containing illustrations with lengthy captions.4 The De Brys followed many of the illus trations from the original works, but they often added their own inventions or devised an entire visual programme of their own making and clearly pre sented the separate sections with plates as their own contribution to the edi tion. The illustrated frontispieces and the plate sections offer insight into how the De Brys appropriated information from the works they published. They also show how they wanted to present the native peoples of the second non-European world and the Europe colonisers to the audience they had in</page><page sequence="4">Heathendom and civility in the Historia India Orientalis mind. The visual programmes afforded them the best opportunity to mould the heterogeneous materials to suit their concept. The title pages of the first three volumes of each series - all texts with a considerable ethnographic component - suggest that the De Bry brothers wanted to follow the plan of the India Occidentalis series in the first volumes of the India Orientalis series. That plan would have consisted of emphasis ing two themes. The first was heathendom, a distinctive characteristic of the second non-European world by comparison with the correct monotheism in Christian Europe and its deviant counterpart in the world of Islam.5 The adoration of anthropomorphic or polymorphic deities, celestial bodies or other objects in the upper part of the classicising structure that frames the title in title pages alludes to this. Representatives of the native populations from the regions in question are placed below those scenes; their clothing and other attributes raise questions of civility, the second theme. At the end of the sixteenth century civility was an ambivalent umbrella term for properties of societies and for behavioural traits of the individuals who combined to form those societies/ Societies with an appreciable vol ume of trade and industry and the corresponding technology, markets, coinage and cities were labelled civil. The characteristics of civil societies also included the existence of a state on some scale, administered for the common good, with a stable social order and able to defend itself adequately against external enemies. These societies were familiar with the art of writ ing, or even better the printed word, the emblem of civility par excellence. The members of these societies led disciplined professional and family lives. They kept their sexual and aggressive instincts under control and attached importance to education, the arts and the sciences. Societies that were barely familiar with these traits were barbarian.7 In determining the degree of civil ity of a society, the dominant religious practices were evaluated not in terms of the truth of the doctrine from which they sprang, but in terms of their contribution to an orderly and prosperous life. Europeans used this term to distinguish themselves from non-Euro peans and from one another. Many gradations could be found between the extremes of full civility and absolute barbarism; there were gradations within and between societies, and they could be detected in their history and in the life-cycle of individuals. The term could be one of self-affirma tion or of self-criticism. People could expose their own society's shortcom ings by a critical reversal of the contrast, either by condemning the barbarity of the civilised, or by praising the civility of the barbarians. Another self critical strategy was that of idealising the other's civility in order to bring out one's own shortcomings. This could lead to respect for non-European soci eties or for Europe's internal others. Classification of societies - and the related self-definition - using the concept of civility gradually replaced clas sification on the basis of the dominant religion. In this respect, there is a parallel with the development of the concept of Europe, that gradually came to replace Christendom. Both concepts lead to a secular discourse, but could also be found in texts that advocated conversion to Christianity as the pinnacle of a civil way of life.8 What follows is an analysis of the way that the De Bry brothers adapted the plate sections of their edition of the Itinerario, the work which</page><page sequence="5">Ernst van den Boogaart embodied their vision of Asia and Black Africa.9 There are two reasons for selecting this volume of the series to study the treatment of the themes of heathendom and civility. The first is that the De Bry brothers considerably enlarged the number of illustrations in the Itinerario and drastically modi fied the sequence of the series. The plates in the original Dutch edition sug gested a secular discourse on civility in Asia that called into question the early European sense of superiority vis-a-vis other continents. The question is whether the De Bry brothers adapted the Dutch series to supplement or modify the original discourse, possibly to bring it into line with the approach of the previous volumes of the India Occidentalis series and the first volume of the India Orientalis series. Secondly, it is interesting because the relation between image and text in the Dutch Itinerario was designed to offer a lesson in the empirico-rational acquisition and processing of infor mation. The adaptation by the De Brys makes it possible to determine how they handled the relation between image and text in this specific case. This may in turn throw light on their approach in earlier and later parts with plates. The India Occidentalis and India Orientalis series were the products of teams whose composition was not fixed. The De Bry family worked with a group of translators because they published the volumes in Latin and Ger man. Sometimes they also brought in other artists to design and engrave the plates. It is conceivable that the translators advised the publishers on cuts and editing in the text, and that the artists assisted them in conceiving the illustrated sections. The De Bry brothers designed and engraved the plates' of their Linschoten edition themselves. The poet, physician and citizen of Frankfurt Adam Lonicer (Teucrides Annaeus Lonicerus privatus), who had assisted with Volume III of the India Occidentalis series in 1592, and Bilibal dus Strobaeus from Silesia, whose profession is unknown, provided the Latin translation. Neither the intellectual background and religious affilia tions of these men nor the details of the collaboration are known. For that reason the concept of the Linschoten edition will be assigned provisionally to the De Bry brothers. All the same, it is necessary to bear in mind the team character of the production and not to be surprised by any heterogeneous elements in the construction of the work. The dismantling of the structure of discourse and the didactic mechanism inherent in the series of images from the original Itinerario The De Bry brothers decided to combine the Itinerario with the recently published report of the first Dutch fleet to the East Indies by Willem Lodewijcksz and the Dutch exploration of the Northeast Passage by Gerrit de Veer. They issued this compilation as Volumes II to IV of their India Orientalis series. They wanted to give each of these volumes a specific char acter of its own. For that purpose they divided the text of the Itinerario into three volumes and added comparable excerpts from the other two works. Volume II (1598) was predominantly geographical and ethnographic, Vol ume III (1599) was a chronicle of travels, and Volume IV (1601) dealt with natural history. Each volume consisted of the complete text followed by a</page><page sequence="6">Heathendom and civility in the Historia India Orientalis 75 separate section with plates. Lengthy captions, primarily excerpted from the main text, were placed below the plates.10 This design meant that the plates from the Itinerario were also divided and combined with plates from the other two works as well as new plates (see Table 1). Of the total of 117 plates in Volumes II to IV of the India Orientalis series, twenty-four were inven tions of the De Bry brothers, while ninety-three were based on Dutch mod els or were adaptations of those models. Twenty-two of the inventions belong to the Itinerario. This approach meant a thorough dismantling of the structure of the original sequence of illustrations from the Itinerario, since the plates in the Dutch edition formed a series in the strict sense of the word suited to its pronounced didactic character." The prints were arranged in a particular sequence in accordance with the argument that could be construed with the aid of the prints and the accompanying texts. Each print formed one of a pair. The series as a whole was made up from four sub-series of prints of the same kind. Prints from each of these subseries recurred in the five clusters into which the series as a whole could be divided. This construction encour aged the constant comparison of plates with one another and of plates with text. Visual enigmas stimulated this procedure further. In the very act of making comparisons, the viewer/reader understood that the prints offered a method for the systematic comparison of aspects of civility in four Asian societies: China, Goa, Balagatte east of Goa, and Malabar. The texts pro vided the data, while the prints supplied the classificatory concepts required for ordering that data. The comparison led to the insight that the societies could be arranged in an Asian hierarchy of civility with well-administered, prosperous and powerful China at the top, followed by rich but dissolute and weak Portuguese Goa, relatively poor Balagatte where devotees violated the law of nature at the behest of the Brahmans, and finally Malabar as the example of a deeply corrupted, poor and weak society. The hierarchy of civility corresponded to the division into North, Central and South, that could be used as a classificatory grid for the societies situated on the western and eastern Indian Ocean whose representatives were illustrated in the plates, even though the text contained little information about them. The four plates with trees and fruit concluded this exercise with an admonitory lesson intended for European travellers in Asia. The coda showed that nature provided people in this continent with all that they needed to sur Table 1. Distribution of texts and plates from the Itinerario among India Orientalis II-FV. Ind. Or.

It was the duty of the European traveller to make sensible use of this offer and to follow the model of the Chinese rather than the Malabars. The Por tuguese in Goa were an admonitory example of what could happen to Euro peans in Asia if they failed to behave in accordance with their own norms of civility. The De Bry brothers paid no heed to this construction; indeed, they may not have noticed it. They altered the sequence of the clusters. The clus ter of plates with Chinese, which stood at the beginning of the original series, was now placed after the images of the native peoples of India. The plates on the Portuguese in Goa, which followed those of the Chinese, were now placed right at the end of the group of plates that concluded Volume II of the India Orientalis series. The clusters, where they could still be recog nised, no longer represented the original hierarchy of civility. Moreover, by detaching the four 'botanical plates' from the plates with figures and setting them in Volume IV, the brothers cut off the final warning and placed it in a very different context. This all meant a radical change to the discursive structure of the original series. The De Bry brothers also introduced changes in the sequence of the individual plates. In the Dutch series, the Malays and Javanese (Fig.i)12 formed the first plate, and the Mandarins and Chinese Commoners (Fig.i) the second. The parallels between the scenes - the repetition of two couples - encouraged the viewer to compare the plates, while the puzzling attributes of the figures - flowers and betel leaves - were intended to prompt him to compare image and text. The idea was that the viewer/reader would con tinue to do so, a procedure which was further encouraged by allowing most of the plates with ethnic types to follow one another. The De Bry brothers moved the Malayans and Javanese to accompany the plates of Malabar as Plate 20. Because of their narrative character, the first two plates of the Frankfurt series, which are about the Dutch in Gabon, fail to take over this function of the original introductory plates. As a result, the dialogue between viewer/reader and image/text fails to get under way, at least not in the way that had been programmed in the original series. What is more, the fourteen new prints that the De Bry brothers added blurred the character of the sub-series from which the series as a whole was built up, and modified their mutual relation. In the original series the ten plates with ethnic couples formed the core series that demonstrated the hierarchy of civility in its generality. The two other sub-series with human figures were specifications. The series with processions of notables and ships suggested classifications of political regimes and technical skill. The series with 'large scenes' helped the viewer/reader to bring order to the informa tion about the moral effects of the various religions. The new plates that the De Bry brothers added are all 'large scenes', representations with many fig ures. The prints of this kind dominate the plate section of Volume II of the India Orientalis series by their number alone, and thereby appear to form the core series. However, they are by no means all concerned with religious matters, but show mostly gruesome or astonishing activities, and some of them exhibit formal similarities to the sub-series with the processions of notables and ships. Thus, the sub-series no longer suggest general concepts</page><page sequence="9">Ernst van den Boogaart for the ordering of the information provided by the plates and texts and for the systematic description and comparison of societies. As will be seen, the De Bry brothers were not out to teach their public how to systematically look, read and process what they learnt, but to allow the armchair traveller to experience the exotic world through emotional scenes and to impress the striking characteristics on his memory." The new plan of the series of plates in Volume II of the Historia Indiae Orientalis The De Bry brothers replaced the plan of the original series of plates in the Itinerario with a construction of their own, although it was built up to a large extent from the material that they borrowed. Instead of following an arrangement that corresponded to an expository disquisition about the gra dations of civility in Asia, they arranged the plates in Volume II in a primar ily geographical way. The first two plates showed the viewer/reader places in Gabon on the coast of West Africa. Linschoten had not been there, as was mentioned in the captions, but the De Brys probably added the plates to supplement the information they had provided about Black Africa in the account of the Kingdom of Congo. After that they conducted the viewer/reader from West to East past the main areas in Asia where the Por tuguese traded, from Mozambique to China. Mozambique (Pis. 3 and 4) is followed by Abyssinia, Arabia and Ormuz (Pis. 5-7). This is continued by a large group of plates on western India (Pis. 8-22), though they include a scene that is set in Vijayanagar in South-East India. The illustration from the original Itinerario in which the St Thomas Christians of Malabar were compared with the residents of Pegu (Burma) and the Moluccas is suc ceeded by the plate with natives of Malacca and Java, so that a continuation of the journey to the East is inserted into the group of illustrations about India. An extensive treatment of China comes next (Pis. 23-32). The set of plates in Volume II of the India Orientalis series comes to a close with six illustrations dealing with the Portuguese in Goa (Pis. 33-38). The arrangement of plates 3-32 proceeding from West to East matched the geographical description in Chapters 4 to 26 of the Itinerario and the geographical structure of the India Occidentalis and India Orientalis series as a whole. It was also conventional in the older Portuguese geographical accounts of Asia, and was followed in the ethnographic illustrations in the Codex Casanatense.14 That arrangement usually placed Goa roughly in the middle of the account. The place assigned to it in the plate section of Vol ume II of the India Orientalis series is unusual. It looks as though the De Bry brothers have detached the centre of the Portuguese commercial empire from the geographical arrangement to construct a correspondence to the first two plates. It is only in the initial and final plates in Volume II that Europeans and non-Europeans appear within the same plate. No Europeans are to be found in the intervening plates. The intention was apparently to present the peculiar world of the East Indies on its own terms before show ing the world of the Portuguese in Asia. The armchair journey from Black Africa to China revealed the diver sity in physical appearance and practices of the population of the East</page><page sequence="10">Heathendom and civility in the Historia India Orientalis 79 Indies. The plates with ethnic types, inspired by the European books of cos tume, showed the variety of dress and adornment. In the sixteenth century, as today, dress was an indicator of the spiritual and moral quality of the wearer. Differences in dress were an indication of differences in wealth, technical ability, morality and good manners between the peoples of the selected areas. The scantily or shoddily clad representatives of poor societies alternated with the decently dressed wearers of tailored and stitched materials from the more prosperous regions. In the original series, the plates with eth nic types formed the core series that informed the viewer about the countries, peoples and degrees of civility of Asia. These plates in India Orientalis II no longer invite systematic comparison, but they do ensure that a general indi cation of the degree of civility plays its part along with all the other informa tion about the customs of various parts of Asia and Black Africa. The plates with 'large scenes', processions of notables and ships seem at first sight to be intended to confront the viewer/reader with a shocking diversity of practices within Portuguese Asia. They show means of trans port, wedding and funeral ceremonies, the veneration of gods, and the intercourse between rulers and ruled. Chinese notables were carried in a standing or seated position. The litter of the Portuguese in Goa was a sort of bed. The Chinese had large sailing vessels with a wooden anchor, while the Malabars had galleys that could also sail, small vessels with an outrigger, and 3 boats made from hollowed out tree trunks. The ruler of Mozambique hon- Title page. India Orientalis II, 1599. oured his vassals with the dried penises of vanquished enemies. In China successful candidates in the civil service examination received a hat with feathers as an indication of their new rank, awarded by the representatives of the emperor. In India widows voluntarily joined the bodies of their deceased husbands on the funeral pyre. The body of a dead Chinese was preserved in a sitting position for fourteen days, covered with a cloth scented with incense on which his portrait was painted. In India the heathen worshipped cows and a deity with a head with many horns on top and in the middle of its body, while in China they venerated a three-headed anthropomorphic god. The illustrations and the accompanying texts provided information about the variety of facial features and skin pigmentation among the Asians, about deformations of the body through tattoos, and about elongated ear lobes and hereditary elephantiasis. In the original Dutch series of plates, the diversity of morals and cus toms, of technical skill and social wealth, was ordered by means of a number of general concepts that could be regarded as aspects of the notion of civility, an idea that was expected to be familiar to and respected by everyone as a guide in life. The variety of Asian practices was turned into the Asian hierar chy of civility. It seems, at least at first sight, that the Frankfurt series of plates was intended to demonstrate the diversity of Asian customs and dress for its own sake, without any further ordering or a central theme. However, the illustrated title page of the main body of text of India Orientalis II suggests that the section with plates is concerned with a domi nant theme. (Fig. 3) The architectural construction surrounding the title is divided into three levels. At the centre of the lowest level is the King of Cochin, holding the title aloft. To his left stands the King of Mozambique, while to his right a nayar from Cochin, a member of the warrior aristocracy, 3 Title page. India Orientalis II, 1599.</page><page sequence="11">8θ Ernst van den Boogaart is shown from the rear, but decently covered. The intermediate level is occu pied by the Malay woman with a flower in her right hand facing the Malay man with his kris. The upper level shows two Chinese notables, one accom panied by a servant, who are kneeling before their three-headed god and burning incense in his honour. The interpretation of the hierarchical arrangement of this title page will be presented later. It is sufficient at this point to mention that the topmost level refers to polytheistic heathendom in the East Indies. This suggests that the De Bry brothers not only had a geographical framework in mind when they constructed the series, but also wanted to underline a specific aspect of the diversity of customs, namely heathendom. A more detailed analysis of the plates that lack Europeans (Pis. 3-32) and of the accompanying texts is required to demonstrate to what extent such a hypothesis can be substantiated. Heathendom and civility in the East Indies (Pis. 3-32) i. Atheists, Muslims and branded Christians at the western gateways to Asia (Pis. 3-7; The gateways to Portuguese Asia for travellers from the West were situated in a zone that extended from Mozambique via the Horn of Africa to the ports of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The plates that the De Bry broth ers took from the original series (Pis. 3 and 5) show that scantily clad, black savages lived in Mozambique, while Abyssinia and Arabia had more civil customs. The text recalls that the Arabs were Muslims and that both Mus lims and Christians lived in Abyssinia. The Abyssinian Christians, however, engaged in strange practices. As could be seen from the plate too, they branded the sign of the cross on their face, and their women wore trousers like their Arab counterparts. The coast of Mozambique was inhabited by Muslims and a few Christians, but the interior was populated by heathens who had no notion of a god. Taken together, the new plate (PI. 4) that the De Bry brothers added to the plate on Mozambique from the Dutch Itiner ario, and the two plates on Ormuz (Pis. 6 and 7), suggest that they wanted to show more than just the diversity of religions and the gradations of civil ity in this transitional zone. They emphasised Mozambique and Ormuz, the former as the gateway to Asia for Europeans sailing via the Cape of Good Hope, the second for those who took the caravan route to the Middle East. Inspired by an account from the Itinerario, the De Bry brothers pre sented the horrifying practices of the atheist savages of the interior in the new plate on Mozambique (Fig. 4). The blacks in this part of Africa cas trated their prisoners of war and offered the penises to their ruler by putting them in their mouth and then spitting them out. The monarch returned the offerings to his vassals, who strung them on necklaces for their wives.'5 The first post in the Portuguese East Indies where Europeans disembarked after the rigours of the voyage was a land of completely godless, obscenely cruel, coal-black savages. The two plates on Ormuz present it as an infernally hot place. Nothing grew there. The houses were made of blocks of salt. The res idents constantly sought the coolness of a bath and even slept there (Fig. 5). They were plagued by long worms that gnawed into their flesh and which</page><page sequence="12">Heathendom and civility in the Historia India Orientalis 81 IV.

Polytheism and Islam in India and South-East Asia (Pis. 8-22) The De Bry brothers mainly constructed the journey through India and South-East Asia with plates from the Dutch series. They included all of the plates dealing with those regions. As they left the clusters on Balagatte (Pis. 8-14) and Malabar (Pis. 15-22) largely intact, they too represented India with a region from the centre - Balagatte, east of Goa - and from the south - IV.

Peguan from Burma, and the Moluccan (PI. 19), proceeding from South India to South-East Asia. The plates with ethnic couples from India, which were taken from the Dutch series, distinguished between the relative civility of Balagatte and the relative savagery of Malabar. In Balagatte the elites dressed decently, the brahmin men in an ascetic manner. The common people wore no more than a loin-cloth. Their skin was of a dark complexion. They wore orna ments, but without deforming their bodies. In Malabar the king and the aristocracy went about virtually naked. They were also dark-skinned, but pierced and elongated their ear-lobes. Malabar is presented as a region inhabited by St Thomas Christians, Muslims and heathen, Balagatte as a heathen region with a polytheism, taught by Brahmins, that was of the same kind as in Malabar.

There was already a 8 heavy emphasis on religion in the Indian section of the original series, and Cremation of Brahmin and burning alive J Γ ^ ° .rι :J t_j:_ r\£. ^_l:_ ττ the De Bry brothers have only reinforced it even further in concentrating on native heathendom. The only representation of Islam is a mosque together with the comment that there were 'far too many' of them in Malabar (Fig. 9 6). The only Muslim practice to be mentioned is the fact that the devotees Human sacrifices to idolinNarsinga. India wash their feet before entering the building. This is evidence of a superficial reading of the ambivalent message of the original print: that plate drew a contrast between the mosque without images of the gods but with a Koran school and the idolatry of the native heathen in favour of the former. On the other hand, it associated Islam with sodomy, as was not uncommon in six teenth-century Europe. The reclining figure in the foreground is the same as the standing warrior from the Muslim couple of Cananor (Fig. 7), the only one of the ethnic types to be portrayed from the rear with naked buttocks, a reference to anal intercourse between men, as sodomy was understood in the sixteenth century.17 If the makers of the Frankfurt series picked up this reference, they glossed over it in the text. At any rate, they are reticent in what they have to say about Muslims in India and do not associate them with sexual aberration, like the atheist peoples of Mozambique, nor with IX.

The deluded believers made offer 11 ings to their diabolical idols. The Brahmin priests pretended that the gods Pledging of οαώ and domestic marriage themselves took away the presents, but they consumed them themselves (Pl. 21). The heathen held the cow to be sacred and respected the lives of many animals, as could be seen from their dietary taboos and the ban on killing animals. They had less respect for human life. The Brahmin priests urged the faithful to dispose of their lives on their own authority. They led widows to cast themselves onto the funeral pyres of their dead husbands (Fig. 8; Pl. 9). The accompanying text states that this was regarded as a proof of marital fidelity and that the widow was promised an enjoyable afterlife. A religious procession in Narsinga was an occasion for self-mutilation and suicide. The idolatrous believers took an idol around on a large, sumptuous carriage accompanied by musicians.

The groom and his relatives led the bride to the temple to 12 the accompaniment of music; they then forced her to deflower herself on Village of Indian heathen. India Orientalis the ivory penis of an idol (Fig. 10; PL 10). This was followed by the celebra tion of the marriage in the home, as depicted in a plate (Fig. 11; PI. 11) that 13 the De Bry brothers added to the series. Murmuring ritual phrases, the Thomas Christians, A Moluccan and a bridal couple and their relatives encircled a large fire seven times. This was a magical ritual, as was the swearing of an oath that is shown in the same plate. Standing in a circle drawn on the ground with ashes, and with ashes on their heads, the heathen pledged their oath on the idol. The Village near Goa (Fig. 12; PI. 16), the main commentary on Indian heathendom in the Dutch series, has been moved in the Frankfurt series from the group of prints concerning Balagatte, where it belonged, to the group of prints con cerning Malabar. This may be because the adaptors in Frankfurt assumed that heathendom was the same in the two regions and wanted to add a reli gious scene to the Malabar group. The scene itself offered no support for this. The plate depicts the rituals described in the chapter on the canarim, the poor agriculturalists of Balagatte (Itinerario, Ch. 33): purification with the left hand, the daily ablution of the whole body, and the ban on eating unclean animals. Nor are the Malabar villagers shown, who could be recog XVI. Forma Vicorum, j£dificxorumTuguriorumcjucin India.

In the original series the plate was a pen dant to Market ofGoa, and was intended to contrast the strict observance of the heathen commandments in the villages with the loose attitude towards the Christian commandments in the city.19 However, the Frankfurt series has borrowed a passage for the accompanying text from the chapter on the nayar, the aristocratic warrior caste in Cochin, who washed themselves only in stagnant, smelly and slimy water. Heathendom besmirched its followers. There is no reference to this in the print, but apparently the De Bry brothers considered it important to highlight this practice. Remarkably enough, the accompanying texts in the Frankfurt series have nothing else to say about the nayar, unlike the extensive coverage of their exceptionally licentious behaviour and extreme aggressiveness in the Dutch series. The De Bry vision of Indian heathendom corresponded to a large extent to that of the original Dutch series, but there were certain shifts in emphasis. The Frankfurt series did not pay any special attention to the dietary taboos and the ban on killing live creatures, which had formed the crux of the Village near Goa in the original Dutch series. They made explicit the obscene idolatry of the wedding ceremony, reintroduced the suicidal juggernaut ritual known from Varthema, and presented for the first time the magical rites associated with fire and ashes. The Frankfurt series grouped the representatives of the peoples of South-East Asia in the Malabar cluster. This put them in the company of the least civil heathen of India. The picture that is presented of them is summary, but not unfavourable in all cases. To judge by their dress, the Peguans, Javanese and Moluccans belonged to the less civil peoples. The wilfulness of the Javanese is contrasted with the courtly manners of the Malays, whose lan guage was praised as the best in Asia. (Fig. i). In fact, it could be concluded, in these aspects of civility they even surpassed the Chinese. The accompany ing texts to the plates make no mention of the heathen practices of the peo ples of Pegu (Burma), Malacca, Java and the Moluccas (Pis. 19 and 20). They mainly comment on the physical characteristics, dress and nature of the dif ferent ethnic groups, with the exception of the Peguans. Sodomy, a crime against God and nature, was held to be widespread among them. This abom ination is also shown in the plate series. The Peguan and the Moluccan form a male couple. The Peguan is the only one of the ethnic types to be repre sented sitting on a large, soft cushion, an allusion to anal intercourse between men (Fig. 13). The viewer could conclude from the tolerance of sodomy that the Burmese practised a particularly corrupt form of heathendom. The Frankfurt series was intended to show that, upon passing through the infernal gateways of Mozambique and Ormuz, European travellers entered a world with a few somewhat civil regions and many barbaric ones. All kinds of heathen practices dominated religious life. These were mostly associated with polytheism. The only place where the De Bry brothers noted the existence of full atheism was in Mozambique. They paid hardly any attention to the presence of native Christians. They remarked the expansion of the monotheistic religion of Islam in the regions around the Indian Ocean, but their approach to Islam was cautious and reticent. The religious situation in South-East Asia was left almost entirely out of the pic ture. Only Pegu was singled out, where abuses against God and nature were</page><page sequence="18">Heathendom a?id civility in the Historia India Orientalis rampant. The praise of the courtly manners of the Malays left the possibility open that godlessness did not reign supreme everywhere in South-East Asia. The main focus was on heathendom in India. The De Bry brothers displayed the practices of polytheistic, Indian heathendom. They did not go into the number and characteristics of the different gods or religious convictions. Besides cruelty and licentiousness, which they had also noted in the case of the atheistic Mozambiquans and the Muslims, they showed that the priests in India spurred believers on to suicide, superstitious idolatry and magical rituals. They related the Indian food taboos to those of the Pythagoreans, but did not mention any affinity between Indian practices and Christian customs. 5. Chinese polytheism and the nature of Chinese civility (Pis. 23-52) The changes that the De Bry brothers made to the original series were the most far-reaching in the section on China. They made use of three prints on China from the Itinerario and supplemented them with seven new ones. For the accompanying texts they not only selected passages from Linschoten's book, but also used sections of the Historia del Reyno de la China by Juan Gonzalez de Mendoza which were not to be found in the Dutch Itinerario.10 They probably took them from the German translation published by Sig mund Feyerabend in Frankfurt in 1589. Departing from the practice that they had followed in the section on India, the De Bry brothers did not make polytheism the main subject of the section on China, but chose a wide range of themes with an emphasis on worldly affairs. Only two and a half prints in the Chinese section - Won drous ceremonies for Chinese idols (PI. 28), and the illustration of death and burial rites (Pis. 31 and 32) - are connected with religion. Four plates, three of them new, are concerned with the state administration by mandarins, especially the administration of justice (Pis. 24, 27, 29 and 30). The remain ing four plates represent the social hierarchy (PI. 23 Mandarins and Chinese commoners), technology (PI. 25 the Land Yacht, and PI. 26 the Junk), or pros perity (PI. 31 the Banquet). The selection of themes is determined by the debate on the Historia del Reyno de la China. The book caused quite a stir throughout Europe.11 It challenged the burgeoning European sense of superiority, as can be seen, for example, from the critical reactions to the Theatrum orbis terrarum (1570) by Abraham Ortelius.11 The title page of this work, the first world atlas, showed Europe as the most civil of the four continents, because it was the home of the Spanish-Portuguese empire, the most powerful and developed kingdom, with colonies all over the world. The Historia del Reyno de la China adduced arguments in favour of the thesis that it was not the empire of Felipe II, but the vast Chinese empire, that was the most prosperous, technologically inventive, scholarly and best administered part of the world. Critics were not slow to argue that Gonzalez de Mendoza had exaggerated and idealised the good administration of China, while others stressed that it was in Europe that Christianity was the most widespread. And was not Christen dom the most civil religion, besides being the single true one? Very few Europeans doubted the latter claim, but not everyone in a Europe torn apart</page><page sequence="19">Ernst van den Boogaart by religious wars was equally convinced of the truth of the former. The prints and accompanying texts in the Frankfurt series address the controver sial question of China's superior civility. The first two plates (Pis. 23 and 24), which are taken from the original Dutch series, introduce the mandarins and the commoners. Their costume reveals that China was a civil and affluent society, where even the common ers were well and decently dressed. The women were 'almost as well dressed as in Spain' (Fig. 2). The accompanying text briefly describes the external appearance of the Chinese in general, mentioning the darker pigmentation of the Cantonese and the lighter complexion of the peoples of the interior. A reference to the need to wear furs in winter indicates that China is largely situated outside the warm, tropical zone. In that respect it resembled Europe, unlike the regions in Asia which were the subject of the previous plates. The Chinese élite clearly differed from the European aristocracy. The mandarins administered the whole empire in the name of the emperor, and they were second to him in rank. They were scholarly, unarmed civil ser vants, recruited by examination and not, as in Europe, drawn from the ranks of a hereditary aristocracy of lower 'princes and potentates'. China was ruled by administrators and magistrates who obeyed the highest authority in the country, not by knightly families attached to privileges that had been acquired in bygone days. They were hedonists relaxing to enjoy a good meal on board a pleasure boat, rather than engaging in hunting or tournaments. China appeared to be a match for Europe, if not to outstrip it, in wealth and skills. There were many large cities. Trade flourished. It had a sizeable fleet for maritime trade, but the riverine fleet was even more impres sive. Entire floating cities traversed the inland waterways. The Chinese sometimes solved practical problems in a different way to the Europeans, but their solutions were just as effective. Their large sailing vessels, the junks, had bamboo sails instead of canvas ones, and a wooden anchor instead of an iron one (PI. 26). Flowever, some of their inventions corre sponded to those of Europe. Their litter was closer to the "Western model than the Indian palanquin. The four-wheeled land yacht was a brilliant invention that was unknown in Europe (PI. 25). Whereas the main body of text states that the Chinese had invented the art of printing and the firearm before the Europeans, the text accompanying the plate does not mention this subject. The message of the first plates and texts is that, in some respects, China was just as civil as Europe, though in a different but related way, and certainly not superior. The new plates on the mandarins and judicial practices continue this implicitly comparative approach (Pis. 27, 29-31). The scenes are all placed in an urban setting with a classicistic architectural décor. This distinguishes China from India, where all of the scenes were situated in a rural setting. The mandarins who completed the examination successfully received the insignia of office in a sort of basilica (Fig. 14). They entered the city in a pro cession, passing palazzi with Renaissance-style porticos. However, the non European character of the administrative élite can be seen from the main attribute of the procession: the silk banners, carried by four persons, bearing the text of the examination in gold letters.

Whoever is invited takes part in the festivity in one way or another. The plates concerning judicial practices contain similar combinations of the familiar and the unknown to European eyes. The attributes in the procession of magistrates would not have surprised their European counter parts: two silver columns on long poles to indicate that they represent the emperor, two straight poles to indicate that justice is straight and unbend ing, two bundles of rods tied to stakes to refer to their capacity to impose punishment, and two white tablets with the names of the magistrates and the instructions of their superiors (Fig. 16; PL 29).

The accused attended, sitting on a pile of ashes, and was given food and drink, the Chi nese equivalent of the last meal. The punishments also recalled those in Europe, though with variations. The Chinese carried out the death penalty by hanging, and there were prisons where the condemned waited for their sentence to be carried out. However, they did not apply the whip, but beat the calves of the condemned with flat, moistened pieces of wood. (Fig. 17; PL 30) According to Donald Lach, Mendoza's account of the judicial prac tices and punishments introduced critical accents in what was otherwise a XXIX. jeftationc per adhibenturmalefi De Summorum iudicum geftatione per publicum, &amp; dc torturacui lefici.

India Orientalis II, 1599, pi. XXX.</page><page sequence="22">Heathendom and civility in the Historia India Orientalis description full of praise.23 These passages, he argues, were intended to qual ify the civility of the Chinese. It is debatable whether the De Bry brothers also read them in this light. They presented the punishments graphically, but these were no more barbaric than those practised in sixteenth-century Europe.24 Besides, they also illustrated the prison garden as a princely, for mal garden with a geometric layout, in which the prisoners were allowed to walk in the daytime, although they were firmly secured in the block at night. They seem to suggest that in their punishments the Chinese com bined severity with mildness in a laudable manner. The De Bry brothers seem rather to have wanted to use the new plates and texts to call into question the religious side of Chinese civility. In the original Dutch series, China was at the top of the Asian hierarchy of civility, above Catholic Goa. The question of Chinese heathendom was evaded in this series by making the China cluster the only one to lack a large-scale scene dealing with religious matters. The De Bry brothers, on the other hand, made no attempt to conceal Chinese heathendom. They showed that both wealthy Chinese and commoners practised black and white magic (Fig. 18; PI. 28). Victims of superstition, they cast two sticks with a flat and a rounded side in front of the anthropomorphic image of their benevolent, three-headed god, a recollection of the trinity. If both fell with the curved side facing upwards, it augured well for a future event. Otherwise, they mal treated the idol until it provided the desired outcome. This was a childish way to behave, which showed at the same time that they did not respect their benevolent god. Their behaviour in front of the statue of a malevolent deity, an anthropomorphic figure with a horned pig's head and clawed feet, was more dramatic and suspect. Priests brought an illiterate person into a trance, whereupon he received the answers to questions that were put to the idol. The illiterate medium recorded the responses in the rice that was scat tered on the floor. These magical practices showed that the Chinese seemed to act foolishly in the dealings with their idols. However, their religious practices were preferable to the obscene idolatry and suicidal practices of India. They were closer to the white and black magic to which European Christians sometimes resorted, but which were increasingly condemned by Protestants and Catholics in the course of the sixteenth century.25 Some of the rituals connected with death and burial resembled the Christian rites. The Chinese believed in an immortal soul. They held a stat uette of the devil in front of a dying person so that in the afterlife he would remember to remain on good terms with that spirit for his own good (Fig. 15 in the background on the left; PI. 31). The dead were washed, wrapped in a white cloth that had been scented with incense, and placed in a seated posi tion on a bier for fourteen days, during which the mourning ceremonies were conducted, including the burning of pictures of slaves and animals on paper. Finally the deceased was buried and a tree was planted on his grave. In August ceremonies were held to bring the souls of the dead closer to the angels, as on All Souls Day (Fig. 19; PI. 32). The plates concerning China show that in many respects, with the exception of religion, the empire was as civilised as Europe. Chinese civility was different from its European counterpart, but related to it. The same was true of their heathen practices, which did not seem to be completely differ</page><page sequence="23">9 2 Ernst van den Boogaart XXVIII. XXXII.

This message was in line with the tenor of Gonzalez de Mendozas book, which had propagated China as a promising mission field, as well as doing justice to Linschoten's text, which propagated the Chinese empire as 19 the most attractive commercial region in Asia. Ritualsfforthedeadin China. The plates in the Frankfurt series that focused on Asia (Pis. 8-32), as opposed to Eastern Africa and the Middle East, were devoted almost exclu sively to China and India. The contrast between the elaborate dress of the Chinese and the simpler dress of the Indians, as shown in the plates with ethnic types, as well as that between the urban Chinese setting and the rural Indian one, suggest that the De Bry brothers wanted to illustrate a variant of the Asian hierarchy of civility embodied in the original Dutch series. Within India they distinguished in a similar way between Ballagate and Malabar. This points to a tripartite hierarchy of civility in Asia: civilised China, less civilised central India, and barely civilised Malabar. The title page of India Orientalis II designed by the brothers in Frank furt seems to offer some support for this interpretation (Fig. 3). It suggests an Asian hierarchy of civility, but with slightly different regions. At the cen tre of the lowest level is shown the kneeling figure of the King of Cochin, XXVIIL MI fc-fi Chinenfium ccremonia?,quibus in facris &amp;diuino cultuvtuntur. ^ Hint, vlfismfatm-vttmtj'variitltrenwMUMhluth^upipafipnmiimptisifti^ djirem alicttius moment! infituuntfuie negocium terra murine exe aggrcdtunturjdolumadciwt, coUigantque duo ligna, quorum vtrum^ tparteplanum, ex altera rotundumfit: eafortes cxploraturi in alt am pro ticinnt. quoaft am bo tnplanum Uttts deciding omenfaujlum er tt-fivero alter urn — -- in planum, alteram in conuexum decidat, malumertt. •vndetdolo mult is votis (applicant, -vt tdfaujlo nutuftatndet. atfivlteritu ligna inaquah pojituprocidant, indignantur idola,/applicant tamen rurfumjignaqtte tertia vice experiuntur, quxft tertia •viceinjau JlopoJitn proiettafin tIdolumpedtbtts proterunt abteclumquetn mare, ant in tgnen txparte,ftue etiam tandtu verberibtu mulct ant, donee ligna optatoiaftuin pUnur. in locumfit urn idolum reponuntfxeufantesfe &amp; ho ft ins opim.es Hit ojfercntes. mem datum comburunt num cadant, quo facto tJit urn idolum reponuntfxeujantesft &amp; hojlias opimas Hit ojfercntes.

To his left stands the King of Mozambique, to his right a nayar from Cochin. The intermediate level is occupied by the man and woman from Malacca, a region described as the most courtly of Asia with 'the best Asian language'. The upper level shows Chinese kneeling before their benevolent, three-headed god. This scene points to a tendency to simplify the picture of the gradations of civility in Asia that was presented in the section with plates. The De Bry brothers had tempered Chinas claim to exemplary civility by illustrating Chinese heathendom, while at the same time they had shown that Chinese heathendom was more civil than that of India. Moreover they had emphasised the excellence of the Chinese ruling élite, while they had left out the qualities of the Indian rulers and of the wealth produced under their guidance. In this way they had created a con trast between China, which was exceptionally civil when it came to worldly affairs, but was marred by subservience to magical practices, and India, where a generally prevalent, cruel idolatry blurred regional gradations in what was often a low level of civility. The tripartite division tended towards a bipartition between India and China, possibly corresponding to a contrast between the tropical and the temperate zone in Asia. This tendency towards a bipartite division helps to understand the arrangement on the title page. The King of Cochin and his nayar are set on the lowest level together with the King of Mozambique. India is represented by the least civil region and associated with blackest heathendom. The Malays, the Asians with the 'best manners' and 'best language' of Asia, occupy the intermediate level. The Chinese worshipping their benevolent, three-headed idol, occupy the upper register because of their vast, well administered and prosperous empire, an eminent position that is only impaired by their heathendom. The scene on the title page shows a sharpen ing of the contrast between China and India that emerged from considera tion of the section with plates, while it still maintains a tripartite division. The inhabitants of Malacca, the gateway to China, filled the lacuna that had been created through the heightening of the contrast between India and China. The positive reappraisal of the Malays was facilitated because their religion had been left out of the plates and accompanying text entirely. The analysis of plates 3-32 shows that the De Bry brothers had devised a variant of the Asian hierarchy of civility as depicted in the original Dutch series. Instead of applying the metaphor of the ladder, that illustrated a gradual descent from eminent civility to deepest barbarism, they opted for a trip from West to East in accordance with their geographical arrangement of the plates. After passing through the gateways of infernal Mozambique and Ormuz, the European voyager first entered the world of Brahmin idolatry, where animal lives were held sacred and human lives were of no account. This alien idolatry was so universal in India that it blurred regional grada tions in worldly civility and influenced life there to such an extent that mis sionary activity seemed a hopeless enterprise. As a result, the entire subcon tinent could be reduced to the level of barbarian Malabar. The gateway of relatively civil Malacca led the traveller to China, that was as civil as Europe in worldly terms, and where heathendom seemed to some extent closer to Christendom and capable of improvement.</page><page sequence="25">54 Ernst van den Boogaart I xxtFif.

It formed the second cluster preceding the cluster concerning China, and was followed by the clusters concerning Balagatte and Malabar. This corre sponded to the ranking in second place of Goa in the Asian hierarchy of civility. It was the centre of a large and relatively prosperous commercial empire. However, the corrupt administration and the loose morals turned the European good manners and the ostentatiously practised Catholicism into a hollow fa9ade. This decay was connected with slavery and intercourse with native women. The large plate of the Market of Goa illustrated this evaluation, while the other plates in the cluster depicted the unsavoury details derived from Linschoten's text.26 Although Goa occupied second place among the societies of Asia, the Goa cluster contained the largest number of plates of all clusters in the Dutch series - an indication of the importance that the inventor attached to this section. The De Bry brothers gave Goa and the Portuguese in Asia much less coverage. In fact, they allocated the smallest number of plates to the Goa cluster. They dropped two plates from the original group (the Four Por tuguese Women and the Portuguese Woman in Closed Litter), without adding any new plates at all; the new plates that they designed showing Portuguese are contained in the section with plates of India Orientalis III. They also gave the Goa cluster a different position in the sequence of plates. They only got around to the centre of the Estado da India after the completion of the journey through the societies of Asia from West to East. Does this mean that they regarded Goa as not belonging to the Asian world? Do the plates on Goa in the second volume of India Orientalis anticipate a new theme that was to be further developed in Volume III? Before dealing with these ques tions, it is advisable to determine what the brothers in Frankfurt did with the plates that they copied from the original series. The De Bry brothers paid close attention to the Market of Goa (Fig. 20; PI. 37). This can be seen from the pains they took to apply a number and a corresponding explanation in the accompanying text to certain scenes and figures which had been given a Portuguese caption or whose identification had been left up to the viewer in the original plate. They drew the viewer's attention to the slave market and the sale of the horse, but without citing the disparaging comparison that Linschoten had made in his text between the sale of people and animals. They described the woman with a child and the woman with a pitcher in the foreground as wetnurses or slaves, adding that Portuguese soldiers often impregnated slaves and that the children remained the property of the slave-owner. This very succinct comment touches upon the crux of the scene: the dissolution of family ties by slavery, loose morals and miscegenation. However, the captions fail to link the scene with the other scenes, not even with the sale of goods from the mariner's chest which occupies the centre of the illustration. It is described as a sale by a crier, but there is no mention of the fact that it concerns the legacy of a Portuguese who has become the victim of his dissolute way of life, as the main text stated. The adaptors treated the scenes as representations of real</page><page sequence="28">Heathendom and civility in the Historia India Orientalis 97 L.

The dropping of the plates Four Portuguese Women and Portuguese Woman in Closed Litter points in the same direction. The former demon strated the contrast between loose morals at home and the facade of decency in public life: the women were very modestly dressed outdoors, but at home they wore see-through blouses and gave their menfolk betel leaves to arouse their sexual appetites (Fig. 21).

In the original series, the woman in the open litter, who moves from right to left, contrary to illustra tive practice, was intended to show that this contravention of the rule by women showed reality better than the woman in a closed litter, who fol lowed the rule and presented a facade of respectability. The purpose of Noc turnal Procession (PI. 35) in the original series was to show that servant women were just as licentious as their mistresses. They seized the opportu nity of such demonstrations of piety for brief trysts with their lovers. The text that accompanies the plate by the De Bry brothers, however, only men tions that the Portuguese thought that these processions earned them a great indulgence - a dig at Catholicism. Unlike the original Dutch series, the Frankfurt series does not draw explicit attention to the dissolution of family life through slavery and miscegenation by the Portuguese in Goa. The same is true of the theme of administrative corruption, the sec ond reason for placing Portuguese Goa below China in the Asian hierarchy of civilisation in the original Dutch series of plates. The captions to that work expanded on the greed for profit among all levels of Portuguese soci ety; from viceroy to soldier, everyone was out to fill his own pocket in the shortest possible time at the expense of the mother country.

They remained dependent on a powerful master and 23 accepted the support of their Asian paramours. There is no trace of this in Dutch pay respect to Black King in Gabon. the Frankfurt series. The brief texts that accompany the illustrations of the Portuguese notables on horseback or in a litter (Pis. 33-34) emphasise the 24 wealth and luxurious lives of the prominent Portuguese in Goa. They were Dutch welcomed by Blacks in coastal transported reclining on silk cushions, surrounded by a crowd of African and Asian servants, who drove away the flies for them. Even the poor sol diers (PL 38) could still find even poorer natives to perform services for them for a pittance. The Portuguese in Goa are depicted as a successful, estab lished élite of white and powerful colonials. The De Bry brothers did not dismiss Catholicism in Goa as a facade, as the Dutch series of plates had done. Their handling of the theme can per haps best be characterised as insipid. They did not exclude Catholicism from the picture, but their failure to comment on it is striking. The Miseri cordia, a lay brotherhood that played a central role in uniting religious and secular life, was prominently depicted in the Market of Goa, but was not given a number or explanatory comment. The rosary held aloft by the sol dier in the illustration of the Three Portuguese Commoners (Fig. 22) cries out for an anti-Catholic remark, as in the case of the indulgences, but the broth 1.

India Orientalis II, 1599, pi. II.</page><page sequence="31">100 Ernst van den Boogaart ers fail to deliver it. The mission work of the Jesuits among the natives is mentioned en passant without any further comment. Not distracted by any anti-Catholic remarks, the reader/viewer might have noticed that the plates shows a measure of civilising influence by the Portuguese on the worldly life of the natives. The majority of the servants wear Western clothes. It seems to indicate that the Portuguese, who may not have been the most exemplary Christians, nevertheless did carry out some civilising work in their Asian territory. The apparently successful colonial rulers at the end of the section with plates in India Orientalis II form a contrast with the two plates at the begin ning: the Dutch on the coast of Gabon. The former shows civilly dressed Whites kneeling before a virtually naked Black ruler who lives in a straw hut (Fig. 23; PI. 1). The second shows Blacks who welcome the Whites as super natural beings to whom all honour is due (Fig. 24; PI. 2). The Blacks emit cries of joy, beat their triangular knives together, and strew cut grass before the feet of their guests. They had never seen Whites before. The European civilising mission had still to commence here. In Goa, on the other hand, work was already under way. The Portuguese lived in Asia, but did not form a part of it, even though they had managed to leave their mark on a small region. The first two and the last six plates of India Orientalis II show Euro pean expansion in action, as had also been done in the first volume, the account of the Kingdom of Congo. The intervening plates show the immense area where Europeans had very little influence. This was a region where the rulers of the East administered more or less civil societies and practised a religion entirely of their own or a heathendom related to West ern forms of religion. This arrangement may indicate that the De Bry broth ers wanted to illustrate the European civilising mission in the tropical zones of Africa and Asia at the beginning and the end of the series of plates, but in a limited way to show that for the time being it was merely a drop in the ocean. The plates in India Orientalis II form a self-contained entity in this interpretation. The De Bry brothers concluded Volume II with a relatively flattering picture of Portuguese colonialism in Goa. This did not mean that they were completely insensitive to the more critical view that had been adopted of the Asian Lisbon in the Dutch series. Linschoten had highlighted all kinds of weaknesses in the administrative and military organisation of the Estado da India, without pulling his punches. He had adopted a particularly critical tone on sexual morality in Goa, and had described several spectacular events which seemed to indicate that the Iberian empire was in decline. The De Bry brothers did not ignore these admonitory stories. The plates that accompanied Chapter 92 of the Itinerario in India Orientalis III illustrated some of these ominous events, such as the shipwreck of the S. Iago near the Cape of Good Hope in 1585, the murder of Linschoten's friend Frans de Coningh in Goa, the awesome earthquake on S. Miquel and the five-day hurricane on Terceira. These plates suggest that the brothers were holding something back on the Portuguese empire in Asia in the section with plates of India Orientalis II, or perhaps they may have changed their opinion with the passage of time and in the light of the Dutch successes in navigating to Asia. The latter hypothesis is in accordance with the assumption that the</page><page sequence="32">Heathendom and civility in the Historia India Orientalis 101 plates in Volume II form a self-contained entity. In that case, the plates in Volume III would be a supplement in a changed context. Volume III marked the start of the story of the Dutch in Asia. Conclusion In the section with plates of India Orientalis II, the De Bry brothers intro duced their public to the diversity of customs in Portuguese Asia by means of a combination of image and text. They made it possible to compare and evaluate life-styles with one another and implicitly with those of Europe. In this respect the series resembles the one in the original Itinerario. This affin ity lies in the fact that many of the original plates were copied. However, the information about the diverse customs is conveyed in a different way, the comparison is organised differently, and arrives at a different conclusion. This was the result of the way the De Bry brothers modified the original series by dropping some plates, adding others, altering the sequence, and - in the case of China - even adding new text. The viewer/reader of the product of the De Bry brothers was not expected to learn about oriental habits by conducting an analytical process himself. They had largely excluded the didactic mechanisms of the enig matic details in the plates, the subseries, the clusters and pairs of plates. Instead, they offered the viewer/reader a journey through Asia from West to East. The excerpts from the text drew attention to salient differences in life styles between the different parts of Asia. They presented those differences in moving scenes, and drove the message home by means of that emotional experience. They did not expect their public to construct the discourse for themselves. It is uncertain whether the De Bry brothers were aware of the change that they introduced in the way of approaching the viewer/reader. They recognised the importance of the Market ofGoa and the Wedding Procession in Ballagate, but used Village near Goa to suit their own ends and did noth ing with, for example, the clues regarding family morality in the illustrations of the Mozambiquans, Arabs and canarim. It is quite likely that the De Bry brothers only grasped the intentions behind the original Dutch series to a very limited extent. It is also possible that they did grasp them, but found them rather ineffective. Some light might be thrown on this question by a more detailed analysis of the strategies deployed by the brothers in earlier volumes. The way the De Bry brothers organised the section with plates dis rupted the sequence in which the Dutch series had presented Asian societies and implied a different judgement. The systematic discourse on the grada tions of civility in China, Goa, Ballagate and Malabar was replaced by the journey from West to East and a comparison that primarily concerned China and India. Portuguese Goa does not appear to have been included in the comparison, but to have been treated as a special case, a colonial society with European, Christian rulers, not a native heathen society. All the same, there is still an affinity with the original Dutch series. The journey from West to East was pregnant with significance. After undergoing the ordeal in Mozambique and Ormuz, the gateways to Asia, the traveller had to with</page><page sequence="33">I02 Ernst van den Boogaart stand the confrontation with heathen and barbarian India before passing through courtly' Malacca and eventually finding some relief in the relatively civil, albeit heathen China. It was a journey through the hierarchy of civility, but in the opposite direction to that followed in the original Dutch series. Seen in this light, Goa may have been placed at the end of the series of plates not to remove it from the comparison with Asian societies, but to present it as the most civil. On this interpretation, the new arrangement would give expression to a self-affirming application of the notion of civility, in accordance with the conviction that Europe demonstrated its higher civility through colonial and religious expansion. The Dutch series, on the other hand, had exposed the colonialism and Catholicism of the Portuguese and called into question the European claim to superiority. In this case, the Protestant De Bry broth ers would have left the religious purity of Catholicism out of account, judg ing it solely in terms of the contribution it made to colonial expansion. Elowever, the particular attention drawn to heathendom by the De Bry brothers in the title pages of India Occidentalis and India Orientalis raises doubts as to whether they really adopted such a secular approach. This emphasis might be an indication that, in contradistinction to the original Dutch series, they did not apply a single measure of civility in which reli gion - heathen or Christian - was one aspect, but regarded heathendom and civility as two separate gauges by which to measure the diversity of customs. The former measured the bad in religious affairs, i.e. those affairs which were of vital importance, while the latter measured the good in worldly affairs, which in the last resort were a secondary concern. In that case, hea thendom always meant a disqualification, even in comparison with a cor rupt form of Christianity. The shifting of the places of Goa and China and the uneven attention paid to characteristics of civility in the cases of the indigenous Indian societies and Goa would then be the result, not of a defence of Europe's superiority in worldly affairs, but of an aversion to hea thendom. It would thus have been an act of Christian self-affirmation.27 Which of the two interpretations is the more likely cannot be decided on the basis of an analysis of the section with plates from India Orientalis II alone; it requires a broadening of the inquiry to the treatment of civility and heathendom and the attitude towards Catholicism and colonialism in the other volumes of India Occidentalis and India Orientalis.</page><page sequence="34">Heathendom and civility in the Historia India Orientalis 103 Notes For the linking of the family name to the collection of travel accounts see the self-portrait of Johan Theodor from 1615. Fr. Obermeier, Brasilien in Illus trationen des 16. Jahrhunderts, Frankfurt am Main 2000, 78-80. Although Theodor de Bry (1528-1598) and his two sons owe their present-day reputation mainly to the travel accounts, they actu ally published (collections of) prints rather than books. Their graphic work is listed - though no longer very ade quately today - in F.W.H.Hollstein, Dutch and Flemish etchings, engravings and woodcuts ca.1450-1700, IV, Amster dam 1951, 27-52. Interest in this part of their production is recent. See e.g. E. Verhaak, 'Emblemata nobilitati etvulgo scitu digna. Een embleemboek uit 1592 als album amicorum van Jean Le Sueur', Bulletin van het Rijks Museum 49 (2001) nos 2/3,141-151 and her unpublished master's thesis De emblemata saecularia, een album amicorum van Johan Theodoor en Johan Israel de Bry, Amster dam 1996. The situation regarding the books published by the De Brys is even worse. I know of no bibliography of the books published by Theodor de Bry and his sons. The guide through the biblio graphical labyrinth of travel accounts is still A. Camus, Mémoire sur la collection des Grands et Petits Voyages et sur le voy age de Thévenot, Paris 1802. , Wolfgang Neuber claims that the series by the De Brys has no systematic struc ture. In support of this, he adduces the fact that the circumnavigation of the world by Jacques l'Hermite can be found both in Volume XII of India Occidentalis and in Volume XIII of India Orientalis, and that Vespucci's third and fourth voyages - to America - are contained in Volume XI of India Orientalis, while the second is in Vol ume X of India Occidentalis. However, this was done after the series had first been concluded. After they were resumed, the brothers seem to have applied a less well-considered, more commercial policy, as Neuber argues. W. Neuber, Fremde Welt im europdis chen Horizont: zur Topik der deutschen Amerika- Reiseberichte der Frühen Neuzeit, Berlin 1991, 249. B. Bucher, La sauvage aux seins pendants, Paris 1977, 7-13. However, Bucher did not specifically explore the Protestant character of the India Occi dentalis and Orientalis series, but rather engaged in a structuralist analysis of the 'amalgame mythico-historique' that the publishers would have created in the sections with plates without being aware of the fact. Divergent themes in the plates from India Occidentalis, she argued, offer the keys to the structure of this worldview. The approach adopted in the present contribution differs from Bucher's structuralism. It is an attempt to reconstruct the making of the sec tions with plates as a primarily deliber ate process of the acquisition and dis semination of knowledge. To what extent these two approaches are mutu ally exclusive or compatible is not dis cussed here. Critical comments on Bucher in M. Duchet (ed.), L'Amérique de Théodore de Bry. Une collection de voyages protestante du XVIe siècle, Paris 1987. 4 The plates and accompanying texts from the sections with plates of India Occidentalis and India Orientalis can be most easily consulted in the editions by F. Berger or G. Sievernich. Berger edited De Bry. Amerika oder die Neue Welt, 2 vols, Leipzig 1977-1978 and De Bry. India Orientalis, 2 vols, Leipzig 1979-1981. These editions fail to repro duce the illustrated title pages and the plates that formed part of the main text. This means that the illustrations from India Occidentalis III, for example, are not included. However, they do contain a useful and fairly extensive commen tary on the sources of the texts and plates. Sievernich edited America. De Bry 1590-1634.

While views on the diversity of customs in the sixteenth century have attracted consid erable interest (see note 7), the influence of non-European expansion on the comparative study of religions is a rela tively unexplored terrain for this period.

The plates from India Orien talis have hardly been analysed at all. Michiel van Groessen uses the plates from Volumes II and III to illustrate his popularisation thesis, but he confines his remarks to the formal aspect of the sections with plates and does not inter pret any of them, nor does he discuss the image of Asia presented by the De Brys.

I do not know whether the De Brys also sold the sections with plates from India Occidental and India Ori entalis separately. In the following com parisons between the section with plates from India Orientalis IIand the original Dutch series, the latter generally refers to the Icones of 1604, where the struc ture of the series emerges more clearly than in the combination of the plates with the full text of the Itinerario in the first edition of 1595-1596. 11 E. van den Boogaart, Civil and corrupt Asia. Image and text in the Itinerario and Icones of Jan Huygen van Linschoten, Chicago 2003,17-21. 12 Fig. refers to the illustrations to the pre sent article; PI. refers to the plates in India Orientalis II. 13 Wolfgang Neuber considers that such images that appeal to the emotions are motivated by a modern version of the ancient ars memorativa. W. Neuber, 'Imago und Pictura. Zur Topik des Sinn-Bilds im Spannungsfeld von Ars Memorativa und Emblematik am Para digma des »Indianers«', in: W. Harms (ed.), Text undBild, Bildund Text, DFG-Symposion 1988, Stuttgart 1990, 245-261, esp. 246-248; see also 310 314· 14 This is an album of representations of the peoples of Portuguese Asia painted on paper and dating from the mid-six teenth century. It is held in the Bib lioteca Casanatense in Rome. Such a series may have served as a model for the plates with ethnic types in the original Itinerario. L. de Matos (ed.), Imagens do Oriente no século XVI. Reproduce do códice português da Biblioteca Casanatense, Lisbon 1985. 15 For most of Linschoten's opinions on the peoples of Portuguese Asia, a similar view can be found in an older Por tuguese source. This is hardly surpris ing, since he obtained his information in Portuguese Goa. However, no equiv alent has been found for this striking passage on the Mozambiquans. For an impression of the Portuguese opinions see: W.G.L. Randies, L 'image du Sud-est Africain dans la littérature européenne au xvie siècle, Lisbon 1958. 16 In doing so, they somewhat widened Linschoten's Goa-centric view of India. His vision was also determined by the fact that he had little idea of the former glory of Vijajanagar and the rise of the Moghul empire. On the influence of Vijajanagar on the European picture of India see: J.-P. Rubies, Travel and eth nology in the Renaissance. South India through European eyes, 1250-1625, Cam bridge 2000. Linschoten followed the development in the Portuguese image of India: Lach, op. cit. (n. 16), Vol. I, book I, 338-492; R. M. Loureiro, 'Visöes da Asia (seculosXVI eXVII)', in: F.

It does not con tain a painting of the burning of a widow, but it does have representations of a widow being stoned alive, of the juggernaut, and of no less than three forms of ritual suicide by brahmins. 19 Van den Boogaart, op. cit.

A number of articles by Walter Demel deal mainly with later develop ments in the European image of China, but often go back to views of the coun try that were held at the end of the six teenth century: W.

The dedications to the arch bishop of Mainz seem to indicate that they were not out to disaffect Catholic customers. There was reason for cau tion, for in 1612 the first eight volumes of India Orientalis were placed on the Index Expurgatorius, which meant that although the works were not con demned in their entirety, they did con tain certain passages that were.
