<plain_text><page sequence="1">Scenery and Setting: A Note on American Local Color ROBERT D. RHODE' ONE of the chief forces in literature is the spontaneous enthusiasm that accom- panies the self-discovery of a vigorous people. Especially since the time of Whit- man, Americans, proud of their cultural and topographical heterogeneity, have made seeing their native country a na- tional sport as well as a patriotic duty. It would be difficult to date the beginning of this manifestation of the nationalistic spirit in art and literature. As a faint cur- rent it unquestionably antedates the Revolution. But nationalism as a self- conscious literary moven- ent seems to have emerged for the first time from the cultural tensions and confused loyalties just after the Civil War: It seemed as though fiction had a mission to portray all sections of the reunited county to each other and, by interpreting the racial strains which made up the United States, pro- vide the understanding which would make possible "the more perfect union" of which the founders of the Republic had dreamed.... The positive editorial policy of the leading publishers, as well as the aims of writers, guided and disciplined the movement in what was per- haps the most wide-spread cooperative move- ment in our literary history.2 Though this movement had many lit- erary aspects, its most distinctive fea- ture has been slighted: the artistic han- dling of setting as an element of fiction. The chief historian of the movement, F. L. Pattee, has frequently touched upon this matter, but not comprehensively. ' Texas College of Arts and Industries. 2 A. H. Quinn, American Fiction (New York, 1936), p. 373. The late V. L. Parrington's work in this period unfortunately remains incom- plete. The history of fiction by A. H. Quinn gives little attention to this phase of the local color movement; usually he merely identifies particular authors with their regions and comments upon their points of view. Other historians and an- thologists, such as Granville Hicks, Louis Wann, G. H. Orians, H. R. Warfel, and C. M. Simpson, have so far made only vague generalizations about the func- tions of setting among the local colorists. The reluctance of critics to acknowl- edge this element of fiction seems almost a conspiracy. Perhaps the neglect springs from the assumption that a stress on set- ting is contrary to the principles of good narration. I should like to discuss this notion in the hope of giving a clearer con- ception of the literature of the local color movement. The setting of a story is usually de- fined as "the literary framework of a nar- rative or other composition,"3 or "the temporal and spatial environment of the action of a narrative."4 H. B. Lathrop includes under the term "all the circum- stances, material and immaterial, which surround the action and determine the conditions under which it takes place."S Bliss Perry considers it as synonymous with milieu,-the circum- stances, namely, that surround and condition 3 New English Dictionary, VIII, 554. 4 Webster's New International Dictionary (2d ed.) p. 2293. s Art of the Novelist (New York, I9I9), p.

Sometimes the setting of a novel corresponds precisely to the scenic effects of the stage in that it gives a mere background for the vivid presentation of the characters. It will thus be seen that in the setting, that tertium quid is something corresponding to "atmosphere" if we were to speak in terms of art, or "environment" if we were to use the terminology of science.6 The realization of the importance of setting, as well as the discovery of the various roles it may play in the story, is comparatively recent. Defoe, despite his "realism," never knew the power of set- tings; Fielding occasionally used scenery without lending it any real significance; it was not until the rise of the romantic movement at the close of the eighteenth century that setting began to have an important function in fiction. Anne Rad- cliffe was one of the first to give emotional significance to landscape. Among the sig- nificant English novelists of the nine- teenth century the conscious and impor- tant use of setting advanced particularly with the work of Dickens, Eliot, and Hardy. This development was a reflec- tion of a changing attitude throughout the world toward nature and natural scenery. One important factor that favored an interest in setting was the preoccupation with natural science. The impact of sci- ence upon literature produced, among other things, a naturalistic style of fic- tion. Zola and Maupassant wrote fiction making use of the characteristic rather than the beautiful. Man was pictured as an atom in an orderly but indifferent world; nature and institutions were in- considerate of his ambitions, his labors, his sufferings. There was no sympathetic relation between the individual and his environment, no teleological principle at work in the universe. 6A Study of Prose Fiction (New York, 1920), p. '55. The desire of artists to be faithful to their subjects led to a method of precise observation and objective presentation. Hence the renowned notebook of the local colorist, the individualized land- scape, and the detailed literary docu- ment. The importance of background, or setting, to the naturalist needs scarcely to be mentioned. He was not so much an artist as a laboratory technician prepar- ing a detailed report. The character in a story, his environment, and his specific reactions are all presented as parts of a sociological process. In the fusion of these elements in the naturalistic story, character tends to suf- fer most, for, as man becomes a pawn in the hands of superior forces, he surren- ders his individuality. Action becomes involuntary and therefore unheroic. Set- ting, however, tends to gain in impor- tance. The landscapes and institutions, as objects of environment, become the prime movers, the cores of ethical-and therefore human-interest. The crux of the problem of setting seems to be the relationship which set- ting as an art bears to the world of expe- rience. Since it is generally conceded that all literature is based ultimately upon reality, its subject matter is necessarily drawn from the author's observation or vicarious experience, however arbitrarily selected or seriously distorted in memory or imagination. The local colorists after the Civil War -the setting specialists-desired as little rearrangement and distortion as possible. They preferred to write with an eye on the object so as to subvert, as far as pos- sible, the subjective factor of memory. But they faced a serious limitation: the weight of tradition surrounding man's relation to nature. If they hoped to see nature with the eyes of Homer, they failed-just as many others after Homer 143</page><page sequence="3">COLLEGE ENGLISH had failed. Rousseau's Nouvelle Helogse, published in I759, is said to mark the beginning of the modern "romantic" love of scenery, but Rousseau's origi- nality was far from absolute. In the handling of natural scenery in fiction, one of the most difficult ques- tions is that concerning "human in- terest." Many critics-old and new- have said that all interest in a story is that which surrounds human life and conduct; that natural scenery, if devoid of humanity, has only a negative force in fiction. No principle of narration was so persistently stressed, as a few quotations will show: Let the author's style be never so rich and brilliant, let him lay hold upon the choicest hidden beauties of the language and adorn his page with images of the most gorgeous or the most pathetic beauty; yet will the whole lack point and application and remain a dead im- passive thing, until the human figure comes into relief-when the pulse of the reader leaps, the spell is woven, the interest is born.7 The print apron of one cottage girl .. . is more important. . . to any novelist than the wildest heave of boulder-strewn moor or forest. Is it not a mistake ... to entitle a story by its setting and to introduce that setting with the utmost power and volume of words? . . . We are not interested in such effects until the people interest us. The environment is important only as bringing out human nature in little unac- customed ways.8 Man is perennially interesting to man; nature is so only when man relates himself to her, puts purpose or meaning into her.9 The solution of this problem of whether an antisocial or a purely aes- thetic interest in scenery is possible depends upon one's aesthetic theory. But 7 H. C. House, Theory of the Genetic Basis of Appeal in Literature (Lincoln, Neb., n.d.), pp. 50-51. 8"Scenery in Fiction," Living Age, CCXXX (December 27, 1902), 813. 9 Norman Foerster, "Clerks of the Woods," Nation, XCVII (August 7, 1913), I20. at least four different affirmative posi- tions have been suggested. First, there is the conception that man's emotional response to nature is an expression of his essential religious nature. One of its advocates, John Addington Symonds,'0 believes that "it is an error to suppose that the ancients were insensible to the charm and beauty of external nature," though their sympathy with nature was anthropomorphic rather than romantic. During the Middle Ages, he continues, Christianity banished the deities and demigods from the earth and left man "face to face with a supreme abstraction, God," who became the sole reality. "All else was illusion, mirage, depending on the divine caprice." In more recent times nature became recognized as an oracle of God, through which great truths are revealed to man, and also as something kindred to himself, because divinely created. This tendency to connect man's reac- tion to landscapes with his religious feel- ings was very common throughout the past century. It has become such a strong convention, writes T. H. Ferril," that it often "thwarts the poet and causes him to waste time." The explana- tion which he offers is that a vast and spectacular scene calls back within the imagination of the author a primitive feeling of awe and wonder which leads him to use weak abstractions rather than vigorous details and therefore to fail in concreteness. In fiction, he explains, the same forces of mountain mysticism are at work. In abandoning the play for the setting the fiction writer feels under pressure to fit his characters to the vast panorama his eyes behold. He becomes oblivious of the complexities of IO "Landscape," Essays Speculative and Sug- gestive (London, 1907), pp. 269 ff.

This results in a simplifica- tion of life into rather pure and tight patterms rigidly conventionalized. He continues heroes and heroines capable of meeting an apparent nature on its most elemental terms. In a word, Ferril asserts that no modern writer is free enough from feelings of awe and impotence in the presence of raw landscape to be able to use the scene in a credible story. "Low-grade animism" or "mysticism" permeates modern expe- rience and precludes the possibility of a great story set in a magnificent moun- tainous region or a vast desert. Thus Ferril's position is not that nature is lacking in interest but that it is too ex- citing to be safely used in fiction. Many late-nineteenth-century critics, like the scientists, were inclined to con- nect the feeling for nature with practical utility. The popularity of emergent and cosmic evolution is reflected in a theory formulated by H. C. House.I" The emo- tional reactions "which constitute the in- terest of literature," he believes, were "at some time in race history ... a factor in survival." All aesthetic responses, whether firsthand or vicarious, are ex- plainable in terms of "natural selection." This would mean that man's present attitude toward nature has evolved as a selective characteristic-that his interP est is deeply grounded and inseparable from the roots of his personality. A third possibility, a thoroughly eco- nomic interpretation of man's emotional response to natural scenery, has been suggested by Havelock Ellis.'3 Though Ellis does not deny such antisocial values in a landscape as freedom from oppres- sion and opportunity for relaxation, he IOp. cit., p. 5. '3 "Love of Wild Nature," Contemporary Review, XCV (February, 1909), I80 ff. subordinates them to economic values from which he believes they are derived by association. He cites the case of the medieval monks who built their monas- teries in picturesque parts of the wilder- ness in an age when love of scenery was at its lowest ebb in history. "The spots they secured," he writes, "were not only cheap in hard cash because despised, and secluded because often situated among the hills, but they had the further advan- tage of being well wooded and that a stream ran through their midst." Besides the religious, evolutionary, and economic interpretations of man's aesthetic response to natural scenery, there was a mechanistic or purely physi- cal one. Though suggestions of it appear in late-nineteenth-century aesthetics, it is perhaps best stated in a study made in 1912 by Walter B. Pitkin.'4 Despite the fact that there are about four or five thousand smells, at least thirty-six thousand colors, and countless other sensory perceptions that are distinguish- able in human experience, the differences in quality are always slight. "All the pleasant impressions resemble one an- other in some underlying characteristic in which a simple animal joy predomi- nates, while all the unpleasant seem merely so many shadings of three things: panic, temperature, color feelings." One can "pass from the joy of a noon-tide landscape to the melancholy of a sunset simply by reducing the amount of light that falls upon the scene.... The range of atmospheric effects is slight." Thus in moods brought on by natural scenes "there seems to be nothing more than a little-understood chemical process with certain light waves, air pressure, and temperatures set up in the nervous sys- 14 Art and Business of Story Writirng (New York, 1912). I45</page><page sequence="5">COLLEGE ENGLISH temrn." It is "probably the merest coinci- dence that some of the feelings caused by these chemisms closely resemble those associated with certain thoughts." Where there is a resemblance, an author may use setting and character to intensify each other. He may work from two inde- pendent sources and still be able to achieve a single emotional effect. Regardless of the truth concerning the source of man's feelings for nature, they must be recognized as something more than literary conventions or habits. James Lane Allen's stories, for example, show a passion for trees and birds remi- niscent of animism, hylozoism, and other ancient mystic cults. Though such ele- ments clash with the Darwinian tone he sometimes assumes, they illustrate the wide range local colorists used in their search for novel uses of setting. The degree of emphasis that may safely be placed upon the setting of a story or novel naturally depends upon the author's understanding of its relation to the other elements. Many of the local colorists-Harte, Twain, Allen, Cable, Freeman, and Garland-succeeded in a major use of setting because they under- stood the basic principle involved. Briefly, this principle is that a lengthy or elaborate use of setting is permissible only if a correspondingly important function is assigned to setting in the structure of the story. In other words, setting as mere background or ornament must of necessity be brief and inconspicu- ous; setting used as a factor in action, an influence upon a character, a symbol of moral value, or an active personality may, on the other hand, have unlimited treatment. Among the local colorists this principle proved to be the chief factor of success, though the skill of an author in weaving his settings into the narrative fabric was also of great significance. Some of the writers-Murfree, De- land, Page, and Eggleston-more often failed than succeeded. In fact, most of the literature of the period was of very low quality, and it is not my aim to re- deem it from the obscurity it deserves. But I should like to stress the point that this failure was not inherent in local color art or in the emphasis it placed on set- ting. The failure was not of the mind but of the hand. A major use of setting is not only a legitimate goal but a very promising one at this moment. Harte's Luck of Roaring Camp, Twain's Rough- ing It, Cable's In Old Creole Days, Free- man's A New England Nun, and Gar- land's Main Traveled Roads-these vol- umes are the sound fruits of a single gen- eration of experimentation in setting. They represent a genre in American let- ters that the researching twentieth cen- tury may bring to fulfilment. Is it possible to control man's mental evolution so as to make him proof against the psychosis of hate and destructiveness? Here I am thinking by no means only of the so-called uncultured masses. Experience proves that it is rather the so-called intelligentsia that is most apt to yield to these dis- astrous collective suggestions, since the intellectual has no direct contact with life in the raw, but encounters it in its easiest, synthetic form on the printed page.-ALBERT EINSTEIN to SIGMUND FREUD, July 30, 1932. 146</page></plain_text>
