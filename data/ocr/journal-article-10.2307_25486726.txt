<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Catholic Mass in James Joyce's Ulysses By Paul L. Briand, Jr. Just as James Joyce uses the myth and episodic framework of Homer's Odyssey to help him "forge upon the smithy of his soul the uncreated conscience of his race"1?Ulysses,2 so does he use the Catholic Mass as another structure for the same purpose. The Odyssey and the Mass furnish contrasting, contrapuntal themes of the Hellenic and Hebraic (Christ and Bloom, and Odysseus accord ing to some interpreters, are Jews), of the pagan and Christian. Although Joyce left home, religion, and country, he wrote of nothing else in his silence, exile, and cunning. Having been a Cath olic who at one time thought of becoming a Jesuit priest, in his apostasy he uses the Catholic Mass as another subject of parody in his epic of mankind. His mimicry of the Mass is sacrilegious, perhaps, from the Catholic point of view; but the mockery serves as another interesting parallel of insight into reality, from the aesthetic point of view. If the Odyssey serves as the history and memory of the race, cyclically being told again through the characters of Stephen Dedalus (Telemachus), Leopold Bloom (Odysseus), and Marion Tweedy Bloom (Penelope), in Dublin, Ireland, on June 16, 1904, then Ulysses gains the religious rite and ritual of hecatomb and burned offering being celebrated anew in the Offertory, Holy Sacrifice, and Communion of the Catholic Mass, in Roman Catholic Dublin. Joyce's parody of the Ordinary of the Mass3 is done explicitly through direct reference to the Latin or the English translation of the Latin, or implicitly by allusion to the similarity of subject matter in certain parts of the Mass. Joyce, however, is celebrating, not the union of Head (God-Christ) and Body (Church-Members) in the mystical body of Christ, through the sacrifice of the Mass; rather, through jocund mockery, he is affirming the union of head (In tellect-Stephen) and body (Flesh-Molly) in the "mystical" body of mankind (Intellect and Flesh-Bloom). Logically, Joyce begins the parody of the Mass with the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar, comes to a climax with the Consecration, and ends with the Last Cospel. These points of the parody coincide with the beginning, climax, and end of the novel. The first lines of Ulysses, in the telemachus episode, chapter 312</page><page sequence="2">PAUL L, BRIAND, JR. 313 one, are a parody of the beginning of Mass, the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar, with Buck Mulligan as the untonsured celebrant: Stately, plumb Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bear ing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressing gown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him by the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned: ?Introibo ad altare Dei. Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called up coarsely: ?Come up, Kinch. Come up, you fearful Jesuit. Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the sur rounding country and the awakening mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak. Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly. ?Back to barracks, he said sterngly. He added in a preacher's tone: ?For this, O dearly beloved is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.4 Buck Milligan here is clearly making fun of the priest by carrying his shaving bowl, with crossed mirror and razor on top, as the priest does the Chalice, covered with the crossed Veil and Burse, when he first comes to the Altar. The way Mulligan wears his yellow, un girdled dressing gown is in comic imitation of the way the priest looks, vested in the free-flowing Alb and colored Chasuble. Mulli gan's Introibo ad altare Dei (I will go to the altar of God) is, after the sign of the cross, the priest's first prayer at the foot of the Altar. The answering prayer by the server h Ad Deum qui laetificat juventutem meam (To God, who gives joy to my youth), which is parodied, much later in the novel, by Stephen on the way to Bella Cohen's brothel, with ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam,5 in which deam is a blasphemous reference to a prostitute. The first three episodes of the novel are in celebration of the young manhood of Stephen; therefore, these introductory prayers are appropriate as a kind of mock invocation to the beginning of Ulysses as a novel-epic. The Christine (the italics are mine) of Mulligan is in reference to the Host which will be transubstantiated at the Consecration of the Mass (the Circe episode of the novel) into the Body and Blood of Christ,</page><page sequence="3">314 JAMES JOYCE QUARTERLY the body and soul and blood and ouns by which Mulligan identifies the Christine. After the beginning prayers, the priest goes to the Epistle side of the Altar and says the Intro?t of the Proper of the Mass, then re turns to the middle of the Altar and repeats three times, alternately with the server, each of the following prayers: Kyrie eleison (Lord, have mercy on us.) Christe eleison (Christ, have mercy on us.) Kyrie eleison (Lord, have mercy on us.) The Kyrie in Ulysses comes in the Aeolus episode, chapter seven: KYRIE ELEISON! A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long lips. ?The Greek! he said again Kyries! Shining word! The vowels the Semite and the Saxon know not. Kyrie! The radiance of the irmteiiect. I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind. Kyrie eloison! The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of cur spirit. We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an Imperium, that went under with the Athenian fleets at AEgospotami, Yes, yes. They went under. Pyrrhus, misled by an orac?e, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of Greece. Loyal to a lost cause.6 Here, in the office of the Freeman s Journal, Professor MacHugh is holding forth on the aspirituality and materialism of the Latin race and on loyalty to the lost causes of the defeat of Napoleon's navy at Trafalgar, the defeat of Athens by Sparta at Aegospotami, and the "defeat" of Pyrrhus. By free association MacHugh has proceeded from the Greek of the Kyrie to the wonders of the intellect, to the Irish spirit, which will never be donated by the English, because the Irish are liege subjects of Catholic Europe. By allusive and symbolic extension, because of the Latin, and the Greek of the Kyrie, of the Mass, the Catholic Church is also a lost cause, to which spiritual support is given by the Dublin Irish. Immediately after the Kyrie of the Mass, the priest, still at the middle of the Altar, says the Gloria in Excelsis Deo. In the library scene of the Scylla and Charybdis episode, chapter nine, the Gloria follows a parody of the Credo, in a black mass reversal. Normally, the Credo follows the Gospel, after the Gloria and the Epistle of the Mass. Also, later in the novel, there is another parody of the Credo, the prayer which summarizes the Catholic belief. In the sequence in Ulysses, the Gloria which follows the first parody of the Credo is given as it is sung during a high Mass from the four-line Plain Chant staff:</page><page sequence="4">PAUL L. BRIAND, JR. 315 Glo?o?ri?a in ex?eel?sis De?o He lifts hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells ac quiring.7 At this point in the novel, the action of the priest is described as he intones the Gloria: he raises and joins his hands, then lowers them in prayer. It was probably the practice of the woman communicants in the Ireland of 1904 to lower their veils, and for the Altar boy to ring the bells. In the library the conversation abruptly returns to the sub ject of Shakespeare, from which it just as abruptly departed before the first parody of the Credo. The main idea in the Credo that Joyce playfully, yet seriously, seizes upon is the mystery of consubstantia tion; it appears strongly in the discussion of Hamlet, in which the Ghost (Shakespeare) and Hamlet (Hamnet) are explained by the scholastic terms of shadow and substance, and of consubstantiality: His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore's rocks or what you will, the sea's voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.8 It is in terms of the consubstantial that Joyce sees the search for the father, the need for identity, the desire for love. What is achieved in the novel is the trinity of the one substance of humanity in the united identities of the persons of Stephen, Bloom, and Molly. After the Hamlet explanation follows the first mockery of the Credo: He Who Himself begot, middier of the Holy Ghost, and Him self sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His friends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like a bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the iatter day to doom the quick and the dead when all the quick shall be dead already. 9 The second mimicry of the Credo comes in the Cyclops episode, chapter twelve, in Barney Kiernan's famous pub, when the Citizen is discussing the practice of flogging in the British Navy: They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was con ceived of unholy beast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed, and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he rose again from the bed, steered in haven, sittith on his beamend till further order whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.10 The Nicene Creed of Catholic belief, of Credo, "I believe," is said</page><page sequence="5">316 JAMES JOYCE QUARTERLY by the priest immediately after the Gospel of the Mass: I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages: God of God, light of light, true God of true God; begotten not made; consubstantial with the Father, by Whom all things were made. Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary, AND WAS MADE MAN. He was crucified for us, suffered under Pontius Pilate, and was buried. And the third day He arose again, according to the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven. He sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory, to judge the living and the dead: and His kingdom shall have no end. And in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son, Who, together with the Father and the Son, is adored and glorified: Who spoke by the prophets. And one holy, catholic, apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the remission of sins. And I expect the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen. Following the Credo is the Offertory and Lavabo, in which the priest offers the unsanctified Host and the Chalice of wine, and washes his hands in preparation for the Consecration. Then the priest kisses the Altar and turning to the people, says the Orate Fratres. As the Oxen of the Sun episode, chapter fourteen, is in preparation for the Circe episode, chapter fifteen, so the Orate Fratres of Stephen in the hospital is in preparation for the black mass consecra tion in the brothel. After discussing Beaumont and Fletcher's sharing of one doxy and saying, "Greater love than this ... no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend," Stephen announces: Orate, fratres, pro memetipso.^ In requesting his friends to pray for himself (memetipso is the in tensive and reflexive of "me, myself"), Stephen calls attention to the extraordinary egocentricity which characterizes him throughout the novel. The priest now says the prayers leading up to the Preface, and the Preface itself. The last words of the preparatory prayers and the first words of the Preface are essentially the same: the server says, "Dignum et justum est" and the priest answers and continues, "Vere dignum et justum est . . ." (It is truly meet and just). In Ulysses, this prayer comes in a black mass reversal to prepare the reader for the celebration of the black mass with its many reversals, in the Circe episode. Father Conmee says the first words of the Preface, in pun</page><page sequence="6">PAUL L. BRIAND, JR. 317 ning free association, as he thinks of Paddy Dignam, the alcoholic who was buried earlier in the day: Vere dignum et justom est12 Then in the Mass follow the Canon, and the climax of the Mass, the sacrifice itself, the Consecration. This is the time for the mystery of transubstantiation, when the priest changes the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ. Joyce, in profane travesty and sac rilegious mockery, has his consecration in a black mass, in a house of prostitution: (. . . On a eminene, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs. Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long pettioat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mass. The Reverend Mr. Hugh C. Haines Love M. A. in a black cassock and mortar board, his head and back to the front, holds over the celebrant's head an open umbrella.) FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli. THE REVEREND MR. HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days. FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blood dripping host.) Corpus Meum. THE REVEREND MR. HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body. THE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Thetopinmo Dog Drol eht rof, Aiulella! (From on high the voice of Adonai calls.) ADONAI Dooooooooooog ! THE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Allelulia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth! (From on high the voice of Adonai calls.) ADONAI Goooooooooood! (In strident discord peasants and townsmen of Orange and Green factions sing King the Pope and Daily, daily sing ta Mary.) PRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!13</page><page sequence="7">318 JAMES JOYCE QUARTERLY Joyce's black mass, coming as it does in the climax of the novel in the Circe episode of chapter fifteen, is itself the climax of the brothel scene. The black mass, part of a wild phantasm, is cele brated by a fallen-away priest, Fr. Malachi O'Flynn, who has taken a consecrated Host and presumably has used it copulatively (a blood dripping host) upon parturient Mrs. Purefoy. On the first level, the words of Private Carr refer to Stephen, who is in a heated argument over Carr's girlfriend, Cissy Cafrey; on a second level, Carr's words fucking Christ refer to the profane action of Father O'Flynn. The Introibo ad altare diaboli indicates that the Mass is to honor the devil. The Htengiar Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rof, Aiulella! and Doooooooooooog! are the black mass reversals of "Allelulia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!" and "Gooooooooooood!" (God!) This climax of reversals within the climax of the novel, comes at the end of the Walpurgis Night phantasmagoria, directly before Stephen is pummeled by Private Carr. Throughout the entire episode there is one "transubstantiation" after another, in parody of the Consecration of the Mass. They are not transubstantiations in which accidents re main the same (as bread and wine) and the substances change (into the Body and Blood of Christ), but fantastic, reversed transubstantia tions and metempsychoses in which accidents change and substances remain the same. Notable among these phantasmic transformations and anthropomorphic grotesqueries, in which metaphor becomes lit eral and subconscious thought and repression become concrete pro jections, are the following: Lipoti Virag, Bloom's grandfather, who becomes a moth; Stephen, who becomes Cardinal Dedalus, primate of Ireland; Molly, who becomes a Turkishwoman, called to "reality" by Bloom's thought of the lemon soap which he has bought for her; Bloom and Stephen, who look into a mirror and see Shakespeare; Bella Cohen, who becomes a man, Bello, who treats Bloom, now a woman, with sadistic indecencies which masochistic Bloom enjoys; the nymph cut from Bloom's girlie magazine and hanging over his bed, which comes to life and cavorts in a woodland come to life from the wallpaper in the brothel.14 The priest, to return to the Mass, now says prayers in commemor ation of the dead, and raising his voice says the Pater Noster: Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven; give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation. Server: But deliver us from evil. Priest: Amen The entire prayer is here quoted because no direct allusion to it is</page><page sequence="8">PAUL L. BRIAND, JR. 319 made in Ulysses. That it is alluded to, however, indirectly, implicitly, and negatively appears certain in the Eumaeus episode, chapter six teen, when Stephen and Bloom are seated in the cabman's shelter: ?. . . Can't you drink that coffee, by the way? Let me stir it and take a piece of that bun. It's like one of our skipper's bricks disguised. Still, no one can give what he hasn't got. Try a bit. ?Couldn't, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further. . . . ?Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred. Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it, Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle?it clopped out of it when taken up?by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage. ?Still, it's solid food, his good genius urged. I'm a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work, mental or manual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different man. ?Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. . . .15 Symbolically, Bloom (Odysseus) is the father for whom Stephen (Telemachus) is searching. By refusing to eat the bun which his father has offered him, and which subconsciously he wants, Stephen is denying the bread of give us this day our daily bread in the Our Father prayer. Stephen, however, has forgiven trespasses by forgiving the streetwalker who has appeared in the doorway of the diner (pp. 616-7); and Bloom, in reciprocation, has forgiven Stephen's trespasses and has been urging Stephen to give up his evil com panions, which Stephen realizes subconsciously, and which is re quested of God the Father in But deliver us from evil. It is significant in this scene that Stephen does take a sip of the coffee; the sip indicates that the search for the father is coming closer to realization, that Stephen and Bloom are getting closer as human beings by identi fication. The next major prayer of the Mass comes when the priest recites the Agnus Dei: Lamb of God, Who takest away the sins of the world; have mercy on us. Lamb of God, Who takest away the sins of the world; have mercy on us. Lamb of God, Who takest away the sins of the world; grant us peace. In another black mass reversal, back to the Circe episode, Stephen and Lynch are talking to three prostitutes, Zoe, Kitty, and Florry:</page><page sequence="9">320 JAMES JOYCE QUARTERLY ZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took here away with him. FLORRY (Nods.) Mr. Lambe from London. STEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world. LYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. Stephen is punning by free association on Mr. Lambe of London to the Agnus Dei, just as Father Conmee punned on the name Dignam to Vere dignum et justum est of the Preface. The puns and ironies of this scene with the prostitutes are manifest. The prayer of the Agnus Dei concerns the "Lamb of God, Who takest away the sins of the world": Stephen, Lynch, and Bloom are sinfully consorting with whores. The last part of the Agnus Dei requests "grant us peace": Lynch is embracing Kitty and saying the same words in Latin, Dona nobis pacem. Lynch is punning through the Latin pacem to the English peace, to the slang meaning of piece (copula tion), which he obviously intends with Kitty. Again Joyce has pro faned the divine and the spiritual with the human and the sexual. The next major part of the Mass is the Communion service for the faithful. Communicants orally receive the Body and Blood of Christ in the one species of bread (each species conceals the whole Christ); spiritually in preparation, believers should be in the state of grace (shriven of sin), before they can receive the Host. In Ulysses Stephen and Bloom partake of communion at 2:00 a.m., in Bloom's house at 7 Eccles street, in the Ithaca episode, chapter seventeen: How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile? He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epp's soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the direc tions for use printed on the label, to each adding after suf ficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed. What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest? Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daugh ter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself, the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly). Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality? His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely and</page><page sequence="10">PAUL L. BRIAND, JR. 321 he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epp's massproduct, the creature cocoa.16 This drinking of the cocoa is symbolically the most important action of the novel; it marks the end of the search for the father by the son, the finding of the son by the father, the attainment of identification for both, and the human communion by the outward sign of cocoa. Cocoa is the liquid form in which the liquid that is Stephen and the solid that is Bloom are contained, and to which Molly is sym bolically added as "the viscous cream ordinarily reserved ... for Marion." The trinity of mankind is now consubstantially complete because of Epp's massproduct, the creature cocoa and the added cream. Vivified Bloom will now assert himself with his wife for the first time in ten years; Molly will prepare breakfast for Bloom, now that he seems to have regained his aggressive masculinity; Stephen, having broken from his precious, priggish shell of selfish aestheticism, can now go forth to create as an objective artist. The next major part of the Mass is the Last Gospel of St. John, after the Mass itself, for all practical purposes, is over and the priest has said, "Ite, missa est," (Go, the ,Mass is ended.). The Last Gospel serves as a coda for the Mass, a recapitulation of Catholic belief. In like manner is the interior monologue of Molly Bloom, the Penelope episode, chapter eighteen, a recapitulation of the entire novel. Molly's breathless soliloquy is the last gospel of mankind, an affirmation of belief in humanity that begins with yes, is sprinkled throughout with yes, and ends with yes. Molly, to paraphrase in a condensation of St. John, is "the word that was in the beginning and the word that was made flesh." She is the symbol of flesh, the earth-mother, the everlasting female, the eternal she. Also, the words of St. John concerning the unacceptability of Christ among his own people, are particularly true in the case of Bloom, who like Christ is a Jew: He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. and in the case of Stephen, who accepted Bloom: But as many as received Him, to them He gave power to be come the sons of God; to them that believe in His name: who are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. Stephen has become the son of Bloom, and by the will of Bloom has been born anew into the world of man. Thus, there is not only a resemblance between Joyce's work and the Mass, as indeed Joyce once said to his brother,17 but Joyce also used the framework of the Mass to serve as yet another structure to</page><page sequence="11">322 JAMES JOYCE QUARTERLY support the smithy of his soul for the forging of the uncreated conscience of his race. 1.
