<plain_text><page sequence="1">25 RELIGIOUS BELIEF AND PERSONAL ADJUSTMENT Henry Myers Lecture, 1948* By PROFESSOR RAYMOND FIRTH, M.A., PH.D. An anthropologist addressing an audience on the subject of religion realises that he is probably facing great divergencies of view. While some may regard all religious professions as illusory, others, like More's Utopians, may hold that it falls below the dignity of human nature to believe that the soul perishes with the body or that the world is governed by chance and not by divine providence. He trusts that his scientific enquiry will reveal something of the nature of religious phenomena, but he knows that he does not stand as the sole interpreter. Apart from the theologian who claims a proprietary right, historian and sociologist, philosopher and psychologist, and even an occasional natural scientist, all proffer their interpretations of what William James summarised as the feelings, acts and experiences of men appre- hending themselves to stand in solemn relation to what they consider to be the divine. Through the scope of his comparative method the anthropologist has contributed a universalism which the study lacked before. His primary observation of primitive cults has added much to its depth. Yet where so much is clouded over by emotion and feeling in the study of those heights of the human spirit which we call religious, the anthropologist's first justification is his sincerity in his attempt to gain as clear an intellectual comprehension of it as possible. His approach has been for the most part humanistic, seeking to understand on the plane of man's activities. It has also been socially positivist, in attributing to religious phenomena important social functions irrespective of the nature of their reality. Anyone who has the honour of being invited to deliver a Henry Myers lecture before the Royal Anthropological Institute must therefore be conscious of his responsibility. Moreover, religion, the general theme of these lectures, has been the matter of examination by so many eminent men in the history of this Institute and of British anthropology. Tylor, Robertson Smith, Frazer, Marett, Westermarck, Rivers, Seligman, Malinowski-all are classic names, and to them must be added that of our most dis- * Delivered to the Royal Anthropological Institute, May 11, 19 8. tinguished conteraporary Radcliffe-Brown, who opened this series. Where their contributions stand like polished granite, my own must appear rough-hewn. But I hope it will serve as an introduction to argument. My subject is religious belief. My basic hypothesis is that religious beliefs are related, in content, form and expression, to the attempts of individuals to secure coherence in their universe of relations, both physical and social. Recent anthropological studies of religion have concentrated more on the analysis of ritual than on that of belief. Religious beliefs appear less stable than ritual, more open to personal variation and modification. Their vagueness and lack of definition are seen in two respects. Different individuals in the same religious communion vary in their beliefs on a given topic, which makes it difficult to assign to any synoptic expression a truly representative value. Again, a single individual is often unable to formulate clearly his belief on even such fundamental concepts as God, Heaven or the soul. Variation in ritual is significant in the inter- pretation of the role which ritual has in the life of different individuals. Variation and lack of precision in belief, too, have analogous significance. Though they may complicate the analyses of the sociologist, they are not fortuitous ; they are characteristic and indeed essential to the functions which religious belief fulfils. Consider first the notion of belief itself. It has been called the subjective side of judgement. It is a set of ideas more or less integrated by reason but held with a conviction that they are true, that they are meaningful in relation to reality. Elements of knowledge, of emotion or feeling tone, and of volitionral activity can be distinguished therein, each capable of being present to varying degree. But however adequate it may be to isolate belief as a psychological concept for examination, for sociological analysis it is necessary to consider it in terms of classes. For our immediate purposes any exact classification is not important. A convenient grouping comprises:- empirical, mathematical, philosophical, wsthetical, ethical and religious. What is noteworthy is how religious belief differs from the others essentially in</page><page sequence="2">26 RAYMOND FIRTH its content of the supernatural and in its quality of he sacred. In religious belief above all, the element of emotion in whatever be the kind of experience that gives the basis to the belief provides it with a strong flavour of reality. At one level, the nature of this experience is a specific question for psychology- as William James, Leuba and many others have amply shown. At another level, as a general question for philosophy, it has occupied the minds of men for over two thousand years. No one wishes deliberately to pass off metaphysics as science. But it has always seemed to me rather naive to imagine that a personal metaphysical position can be entirely irrelevant to the analysis of religious phenomena. So a little later I shall say something about what I think is the object of religious belief. For my present analysis it is primarily the content of belief as expressed in verbal behaviour with which I am concerned. One can study belief in its non- verbal expression as well. But one interest of the word, either spoken or written, as an index of belief, is that it can be studied at different levels-overt, or indicative of much that the author does not suspect is revealed. What I want to emphasise here is that religious beliefs, in their immediate expression, are a mode of action. They are not merely passive fixed items of mental furniture; their emotional component alone would suggest this cannot be so. They are active weapons in the process of adjustment by the person who holds them. What I mean by personal adjustment is the continual process of striving for order by the individual in his relations on the one hand with his physical and social universe, and on the other with his own logical system of categories of thought and his own set of impulses, desires and emotions. I think it will be admitted that there is a continual and real need for such adjustment or adaptation on the part of every individual. In this respect the vagueness and lack of precise definition of religious belief is, up to a point, an asset. It allows of a plastic treatment. Modification takes place in detail, often almost imperceptibly to the external observer, and it may be unconsciously by the individual himself. If this be agreed, then certain implications can be considered. As greater precision in the definition of belief occurs, the greater is the necessity to cope with the change in external circumstances by reinforcing the belief. We shall be concerned with some exam- ination of the processes of reinforcing or buttressing religious belief later. An alternative process is to make a radical alteration in belief by what is known as conversion. In any process of adjustment the content of belief, which varies according to the cultural situation, may be of considerable importance. For example, a belief in an ancestor cult is not of such a type as to allow easily the affiliation of other persons from a different society, who can have the original ancestors ascribed to them only by a series of elaborate fictions. Moreover, the range of religious belief can be expected to vary accordihg tn the range of possible social situations. In a simple society the personal adjustments which an individual may have to make are as great in magnitude as in a highly differentiated society such as our own, but are less in diversity. Each individual has a configuration of religious beliefs corresponding to or representing a configuration of his personal adjustments. These adjustments can have degrees of completeness or adequacy according as the situation to which adjustment is required is more or less adequately conceived. To the degree that there is ignorance or error so there is imperfect adjustment, either recognised or not recognised as such. This conception of the individual's relation to the situations he has to meet is very different from that of a system of equilibrium. It is possible, in fact probable, that each individual has a configuration of more or less imperfect adjustments to reality- always lagging behind or varying from the current situation that he has to face. To conclude this series of propositions for the moment-it is through the continuous operation of personal adjustment in terms of belief that change in religious forms becomes possible. The attempt to secure personal adjustment rests upon a perception that some degree of adaptation between self and environment is necessary to effective action in view of the ends the individual is pursuing. It rests also upon the emotional drive for sympathy and inter-communion. In the process of adjustment various motivations are at work. These include the search for order, for certitude, for self-expression and for feeling for others, for the exercise of intellectual curiosity. It is conceivable that individuals in any society might be content to place reliance on them- selves or on their fellows alone for these elements of adjustment; some do so, especially in the more highly differentiated social systems. And a young child presumably relies on its parents for these matters. But the obvious human insufficiency to cover all the range of circumstances is only too plain- Peoples' limitations, their fallibility, their exercise of their own individualistic impulses, are soon discerned, even where sentiment of a strong kind may lead to trust. The requirements demanded are secured in the highest degree by the postulates of religious belief. Such belief is always culturally defined, whether explicitly recognised as such or not. It has a nucleus</page><page sequence="3">Religious Belief and Personal Adjustment 27 or core, which is firmly held and in essentials usually simple to state; a set of ancillaries or personal variations of a fluctuating kind; and a periphery which is vague, involving either difficulties of formu- lation or lack of certainty or conviction. The nucleus of the belief may be comprised in part by the dogma of the religion concerned, that is, by the set of doctrines regarded as proper to be believed in by all who profess that religion. It may be assisted in utterance by creeds, expressions of the essential dogma in formal terms. But this is not inevitably the case. Most primitive religions have no creeds, and their dogmas are to be inferred from activity rather than from any specific formulation. For evidence of this let me briefly refer to material from my own studies. In Tikopia there is a nuclear belief held, as far as could be verified, by all persons, in what may be termed a separable soul-essence of man. Different people have varying ancillaries attributing or denying soul-essence to birds and animals, to stones and trees, and to material goods. There are varying ancillaries also relating to the fate of souls after death. One man, a chief, linked their fate with their interest in life in the basic religious rite, the kava. Those who ignored the kava in life were themselves ignored after death; their souls, he maintained, were not borne to the spirit world, but left to stand in the path and annoy people. Another man, also a chief and with a similar interest in maintaining the prestige of the kava, believed that the souls of the dead came in due course to a stone crossing a void barring the way to the future world. If the soul was that of a man who had sought the kava, all was well; the stone stayed firm and the soul crossed it to its future abode. If the man had spurned the kava, the stone began to rock and finally precipitated the soul down into the gulf, to be lost. A question as to where the soul goes then showed belief on the periphery-on one occasion the chief said he didn't know, the soul simply vanished; on another occasion he said the soul wandered blindly about. A third man, son of a chief, was not so concerned to interpret the stone in terms of morals or ritual duties. He regarded it as a matter of paying dues, as to a Cerberus. The soul arrives with bark- cloth, areca nut, oil and valuables. If he wishes to pass, he offers them to the female demon dwelling in the stone. Should he not do this, and try to cross, she makes the stone slippery, the soul loses its footing and tumbles down below. As a further ancillary belief, a description was given of certain flying souls. They have " speed," that is, power, and evade toll by taking wing, rising up above and darting onwards through the air like fish in the sea. The personal interests of the chiefs are clear in these beliefs. They compensate for inability to punish ritual laggards directly, by adjustment of belief to imagine them suffering future punishment. To the extent that such views get popular credence, the ritual obligations are reinforced. Similar differences of belief occur in regard to those souls that arrive in the afterworld. The general scheme is that of a number of different heavens, stratified. Each set of strata is associated with a major social group and is situated at a different point of the compass. This is nuclear belief. But there are many individual ancillaries, as regards the names and number of the heavens, and the behaviour of the spirits of the dead there. In particular, this type of belief serves in citation of names in tales and songs, thus acting as material of revelation for spirit mediums. A new name is an effort of the creative imagination, which appeals to other people as a piece of new knowledge, in effect, property. Hence there is a tendency for spirit mediums in their recitals to elabor- ate the furniture of the 'other world, in nomenclature and activities; in so doing they help to bolster up their own authenticity by the production of such novel information, in which they appear to believe firmly. Examination of Malay religious beliefs in a fishing community gave analogous data. Every peison held nuclear beliefs in spirits, the ubiquitous hantu, and in the powers of selected human individuals to control them. But very different beliefs were held about the powers of a specific hantu, or specific human controls. Two dramatic events brought this out to me-the advent of a conjuror claiming to produce sugar, biscuits, and even live birds by materializa- tion; and the practices of a religious man who without experience of the sea and its lore, claimed modestly to be able to increase the catch of fish by well-timed rites with a candle and an egg. The resulting controversies illustrated a variety of ancillary beliefs and their dependence on problems of personal adjustment. In examining belief in the simpler religious systems, the anthropologist relates the concepts under scrutiny to human needs, desires, emotions. He sees for example, how the various kinds of spirit powers believed in, can be interpreted as essentially socialized projections of the believer's own psychological requirements and faculties. Applied on a comparative basis, such findings may lead him to stress the sub- jective character of all religious experience and belief. His hypothesis may be that even those concepts which are normally regarded as basic in a religious system are not independent of the individual human believer, but are part of his total adjustment, in</page><page sequence="4">28 RAYMOND FIRTE common with that of his fellows, to their general field of problems. Let us pursue this theme in terms of the way in which certain basic beliefs have been formulated. Anthropologists o rdinarily study particularist religions, i.e., those in which the system of beliefs and practices is regarded by the adherents as applying to their particular society alone, and not by implication to mankind as a whole. I propose in this lecture to draw examples also from the universalist religions, to broaden my generalizations. In this part of the- analysis I shall examine some of the beliefs concerning the Deity, as being of crucial interest. It is a commonplace that even in the universalist religions belief in God is often conceived in terms which in providing a definite sanction for behaviour, are appropriate to the particular type of society in which the behef finds expression. For instance, in the Koran, the Faithful are enjoined to fight on God's path. Believers who sit at home free from trouble shall not be treated alike with those who do valiantly in the cause of God with their substance and their persons. God has assigned to the latter a rank and a rich recompense above those who sit at home. If a believer kill a believer by mischance, he is bound to atone by blood-money, setting free a slave who is a believer, or both; or by fasting two months if he has no means otherwise. This is the penance enjoined by God, the Knowing, the Wise. But who shall kill a believer of set purpose shall abide in hell for ever; God shall be wrathful with him, and curse him and prepare for him a great torment (Koran, Sura 4, Women, verses 94-97). Here the attitudes attributed to God can be regarded as a projection of the Prophet's desires to safeguard the faith of his creation. The religious sanction is invoked to promote unity and amity among the Faithful and compose differences. The Divine sanction was invoked with a more personal flavour to explain the special dispensa- tion by which the Prophet allowed himself to have as many as nine wives, whereas the maximum number allowed to the Faithful was only four. The Prophet by the Koran was allowed not only the wives whom he had dowered and the daughters of his uncle and of his aunts, but also any believing woman who had given herself up to him, if he desired to wed her- "a privilege for thee above the rest of the Faithful" as the Prophet's own revelation announced it to him (Koran, Sura 33, Confederates, verse 49). Fundamental in the nature of much religious belief is that characteristic which may be called the process of theo-symbolism. The aims of man and the priniciples which- he seeks or thinks he finds in the universe are given shape in the idea of the Deity, who is made their symbolic expression. Social relations or interests empirically- observable are explicitly formulated as inherent or transcendental principles. They are represented as arising not from the nature of social action but from the nature of God. To acquire knowledge is to many people a human good and certainly engages a great deal of tlheir energies. Consequently it is held that it must be God's will that men should use to the full what gifts of intellectual curiosity He has endowed them with. Guidance is felt to be required in one's contacts with one's fellows. Consequently, it is held that God has a will for the world, and that this will, which is perfect and good, sets a pattern for the life of every man.' This theo-symbolism may also assume an inverted form. Some trust and confidence in one's fellow beings is a pre-requisite to effective co-operation and sharing of the products of social endeavour. Hence the con- cept of faith may be expressed as a two-way process. Not only must man have faith in God; he must also believe that God has faith in him. "God puts His trust in man; He depends upon him; He commits to him the responsibility for carrying out His purposes for the world .... God trusts the individual with the raw materials for the formation of character." God's trust is often abused, by human faithlessness, stupidity and indolence. But God continues to trust; God's trust implies His patience (Times, Nov. 13, 1943). Here then is an interesting mechanism whereby a man first projects his desire for confidence into divine shape, and then injects this image in turn with a further charge of the desired element. Human frailty can then be interpreted not merely as failure to take advantage of facilities offered, but as betrayal of facilities handed over. The sanction for human action is thus doubled, and guilt is added to laxity. But there is room for selective adjustment. Assur- ance is given to the shrinking spirit. Where one cannot trust one's fellows, where the course of events belies their fair promise, one can fix one's trust on God, and find that reciprocity which is so craved by feeling that Divinity returns the confidence. Again, to him who wishes to feel that he is entrusted with a task, to feel that in a situation of dependence he is the one who is relied upon for action, a belief that God has com- mitted a responsibility to him-even if it be the onerous one of formation of his own character-can be a I Cf. the view of a Chinese scholar on this point: " Since men have knowledge, many religions regard God as having knowledge, though there is this difference, that he is omniscient. Since men have power, many religions regard God as having power, though with this difference, that he is omnipotent. Since men have a will, many religions regard God as having a will, though with this difference, that his will is perfectly good." (Fung Yu-Lan, 1947, p. 126).</page><page sequence="5">Religious Belief and Personal Adjustment 29 stimulating and heartening thing. However mean a creature he may be in his own eyes and those of his fellows, he is one on whom God depends. If he has faith, he can set back'his shoulders and go forward on his daily business, feeling that every step he takes in the social world is in discharge of a personal duty to the Most High. The same process of attribution helps to provide man with that sense of order which he desires to see in the flux of events that he may guide his future actions and have some certainty in what often seems a sorry tangle. One kind of belief which allows this and strengthens the doubter is that which assigns the origin of the world to a Creator who continues to take a controlling interest in his work. Most religious systems, primitive as well as more developed, have concepts of this type. But 'once the principle of order has been admitted, there is also need for the explanation of contradiction. It is only by the eye of faith that a perfect plan can be discerned. There are several ways in which this can be achieved. One, probably the simplest, is to stress human incapacity to understand. To give a sample citation " The divine plan in its totality is utterly beyond human comprehension, though it must include the possibility of moral and physical evil, and contain within it elements of contingency which are inseparable from human freedom." (Times, Jan. 10, 1948). Another way is to distinguish between the plan or will of God and the imperfection of the human creature as hampering its execution. It is argued that God's will, which stands sure and unshakable through all the ebb and flow of human history, cannot be finally thwarted. But its fulfilment may be hindered and the progress of His kingdom slowed down by human indifference and perversity, and by man's refusal to co-operate with Him (Times, Jan. 10, 1948). By this interpretation it would seem that the Deity is content to abide by the implications of the freedom which He Himself has vouchsafed to man. He accepts therefore the limitations of His own plan. But contradiction or inconsistency may be faced another way. Those who hold fast to the belief that there is only one proper vehicle for the propagation of the divine message of Christianity are distressed by the way in which the historic Church has been divided by the secession of numerous reforming dissident bodies. The spectacle of a divided Christendom, it is argued, is intolerable to anyone who realises what God's will is in regard to His Church. Nevertheless the spectacle of good men and of good works proceed- ing from nests of false doctrine can hardly be denied. An analogous issue which attained wider currency and even some poignancy arose in the first World War when it was discovered that many of the young soldiers who excelled not only in bravery but also in self- sacrifice and in acts of devotion to their fellows did not profess the Christian faith. To such problems many answers have been given. But among them is the view that God is not bound by His own ordinances.2 Having laid down what shall be the proper procedure in the implementation of the Divine plan for salvation, He is nevertheless prepared to receive all that serves His purposes, whether it is prepared to come under the formal jurisdiction or not. This view can be of course a most flexible instrument since it can be used to justify almost any act of expediency. But its interest to us in this connection is the way in which it can serve as a means of adjustment for those who believe in the unique value of one religious faith and have to account for virtue in the adherents of others. One of the most interesting issues in this general theme is that technically known as theodicy, the problem of the vindication of Divine Providence in view of the existence' of pain and evil. This offers an intellectual as well as an emotional challenge to the believer in the conception of the Deity as powerful, wise, good, and concerned with the administration of the universe. For the deeplv religious person evil is a problem to be overcome when it manifests itself in concrete behaviour. But it is also a phenomenon demanding some kind of explanation in terms of the consistency of the divine oversight of the affairs of men. In the religions of the simpler societies behaviour, thought and emotion which are injurious or intended as injurious to man are not usually conceptualized as a single abstraction. Conceptualization takes the form rather of separate type events or institutions, such as death or witchcraft or war. Etiological myths provide their rationale or a defence against them. As Malinowski has pointed out, such myths often treat cosmic events as the product of the simplest human or even animal lapse or omission. Take the myth of death, which is normally regarded as the supreme evil. The ancient Maori people believed that death came from the goddess Hine-nui- te-po, the Great Lady of Darkness. The culture- hero Maui thought that he could win life for man if he penetrated the body of the goddess and touched her heart. In due course he made his attempt, entering her while she lay sleeping by the way from which all men are born. But accident intervened. A little bird, the fantail, seeing Maui's legs kicking in the air as he began the perilous passage, was overcome with laughter at the ridiculous sight and the sound of his mirth woke the sleeping goddess. She closed her body upon Maui and killed him. 2 See for. example, Randolph (1923, p. 10).</page><page sequence="6">30 RAYMOND FIRTH So death continued its hold over man. One Tikopia myth of death algo places man's fate in animal hands. A rat and a crab disputed as to what should happen to man when he grew old. Said the crab, " Let him cast-his skin as I do, emerge freshly and continue to live on." The rat objected to this, saying, " No, let him die and be buried in the ground, that his body may rot away." Here the myths supply explanation and allocate responsibility on a scale and in a way which allows simple comprehension of the great inescapable yet mysterious element in human destiny. Most primitive societies, in conformity with their lack of effective international relations and emphasis on small group organisation, have not proceeded to ideas of a unitary god and a unitary principle of evil. Some of the more advanced religions subsume the phenomena of the universe under integrative principles but do not viewthese as having any personal character. For the Chinese Confucianist philosopher Hsuin Ch'ing, for instance, Heaven, roughly equivalent to Nature, was the unchanging process of action re- sponsible for the final accomplishment of events. " The true sage does not try to know Heaven " though he sees the results. Man's body and spirit are the work of Heaven. Concerning the fundamental nature of man he and other philosophers were often in disagreement. Mencius maintained the innate goodness of man's nature, with evil as due to bad up-bringing. Hsiin Ch'ing maintained its basic evil, to be corrected by the character acquired through the purposive thinking and practice of the sages and expressed in principles of ritual and rightness (Hughes, 1942, pp. 100, 228, 231-35; Fung Yu-Lan, 1947, pp. 81, 117; Soothill, 1929, pp. 40, 205). Buddhism proclaims the unitary principle of the universe, but will hardly call it God even as a symbolic expression. The problem of theodicy hardly arises directly then. The issue is handled by admitting the validity of evil as a real phenomenon, but stressing that it is all part of human involvement in desire.3 The Taoist view, as expressed in the opening of the Tractate on Actions (Kan Ying P'ien) is that " Woe and weal have no gates, men call them on themselves," that is, they are not predestined, but the result of the heart rising to goodness or rising to evil (Soothill, 1929; 222-224). In the monotheistic religions various other solutions to the problem, each allowing a considerable degree of personal interpretation, allocate responsibility differently. The Zoroastrian sees the problem in terms of two active conflicting principles, Good and Evil, each of equal validity. They struggle for mastery in a contest almost indefinitely to be prolonged, though it it hoped that Good will prevail in the end. The Muslim, following the Koran, has a fairly clear cut set of propositions on which to rely, and which place responsibility for the ills of the world on man's own shoulders. God has breathed into the soul its wickedness and its piety, but these are only potentials. Man himself creates his own ills. The believer is told " Whatever good betideth thee is from God, and whatever betideth thee of evil is from thyself" (Koran, Sura, 91, The Sun, verses 7-10; Sura 4, Women, verse 81). In Christianity the existence of evil rests presumably on the ultimate acquiescence of God. But in terms of human affairs its application is understood by reference to the doctrine of the Fall on the one hand, and the principle of human freedom and responsibility on the other. The myth of the original sin of our first parents being due to a simple act of yielding to curiosity is reminis- cent of the myths of the more primitive religions. To make death and the source of all our woe really spring from one single yielding to caprice by an unsophisti- cated woman almost at the beginning of the world is poising this scheme of things on a very slender foundation. Evil and the fruits of evil must therefore have entered into the Great Design before the Creation; the Fall was the symbol not the source. Theological argument about the problem of evil has brought various explanations, including doctrines of self-limitation on the part of God. It is difficult to keep this separate from the idea that He is a 8 The Lotus Sutra, a great canonical book of Mahayana Buddhism, expresses the teaching thus: " The cause of all suffering Is rooted in desire. If desire be extinguished, Suffering has no foothold." In this form of the religion salvation, freedom from suffering, pain and evil is attained by faith in the Buddha and Boddhis- attvas, and in the Sutra which proclaims the Way of the Law. (Soothill, 1930, pp. 97-8 et passim.) The inclusive pan- theistic doctrines of the Tendai sect lay stress on the absolute nature of the Buddha, in which animate and inanimate are of the same essence; in the last resort, therefore, evil is also comprised therein. " Since we are all of the same nature, some good can be found in the lowest of us, and reciprocally there is also some evil in Buddha." The idea is also held that the world is compounded of three thousand dharmas, or fundamental elements. " The spiritual, and that which appears to us as material, good and evil, all our sentient universe and our illusions, are the different aspects under which the play of these three thousand dhcarmas reveal themselves to our senses and to our mind . . . . This universe is so constructed that although it is constituted in its infinity by these three thousand dharma8, a single thought, mean as it may be, contains them all .... The dhcarmas form the world and are all in our thought." (Steinilber-Oberlin, 1938, pp. 77-9.)</page><page sequence="7">Religious Belief and Personal Adjustment 31 finite being and therefore not omnipotent. But it does help to alleviate the burden of the mystery of evil. Another explanation relies largely on the recog- nition of the instrumental worth of evil-the value of physical pain and suffering in moulding character, and that of moral evil as part of the general discipline of education in combating it. Moral evil has been described as the " discord without which there would be no harmony, shade without which there would be no light" (Hastings, 1908). Such an essentially monistic view of the problem preserves the omni- potence of God at the cost of the absoluteness of evil. It is reminiscent of the Hindu view that good and evil alike are phenomenal expressions of the one divine substance or energy; as they operate, often in cyclical opposition, in the world, they are but manifestations of Maya, the mirage-like illusory character of all existence.4 Here then, we have a set of beliefs regarding the nature of evil and its place in the scheme of human life, with several emphases. One is an empiricist attitude, accepting the existence of evil as a given element in the nature of things, whether present as an active principle in the world, or as innate in man's constitution, or the product of his desires. Another associates evil more directly with the permissive control of a Deity, as part of his cosmic plan, either as embedded in the great design or called into opera- tion by ,some fatal action of man. The more enlarged the conception of the Deity, the more difficult becomes the problem of justification of the Divine providence. In all cases an element of human activity is involved, both in setting the processes of evil in motion and in putting an end to them and their consequences. Freedom from evil and its results can be attained according to some religious beliefs by the acts of self-restraint of a more or less positive kind, forming a virtuous life. According to other beliefs, it is reached by the acts of faith, accompanied by some degree of regret or repentance for what has been done, and leading of themselves to salvation. Emotionally the acts of faith are more attractive and easier as a solution than the acts of self-discipline without reference to Divine grace. Intellectually, it may be more difficult to say honestly " I believe ...... "than to see the reasonableness of altering one's way of life. With every profession of faith is mingled a modicum of reason. But for the man who endeavours to guide himself by thought and not simply by emotion, the sedative of faith is not enough; it must be balanced 4 Cf. Zimmer (1946, p. 136). " Hindu wisdom, Hindu religion, accepts the doom and forms of death as the dark- tones of a cosmic symphony . . . . by the stimulant of argument. For belief to be effective as an instrument of personal adjustment, therefore, one expects to find elaborate intellectual analysis mingled with the statement of what are conceived as the results of experience. So far we have been examining what may be called public expressions of belief; now let us consider some more individual formulations. These are to be found in particular as far as Christianity goes in the sphere of speculative theism-in arguments for the existence of God, and about the attributes of God. I would emphasise that I am concerned not with the logical validity of the arguments, but with their form and content as sociological expressions, reflecting interests and providing means of action. The ontological argument of Anselm, and its reformulation by Descartes, .the aetiological and other arguments of Leibnitz, the Thomist arguments from motion and so on, are all attempts to buttress by the power of logic those convictions which rest on the basis of faith. The reasoned sequences of propositions regard- ing the dependence of conception upon existence; the necessity of an Existent which is not contingent but carries within it its own cause or reason; the relation of order and intelligibility in the world to an intelligent, planning Creator are religious as well as metaphysical exercises. The urgency of the argument that in each case the inference must be so reveals how the imperative that drives the disputant emerges from his own need for intellectual reassurance, rather than from the rigour of the implications of the premisses.5 Nowadays, all this brave show brings only feeble applause. It is true that a generation ago one daring spirit reformulated the ontological argument, with certain 5 Muslim theology has its parallels in this field. For example, take the arguments of Ibn Maskawaih, a mediaeval historian who died in the early years of the eleventh century, nearly 150 years before Saint Thomas. In his " Proof of the Maker," the first chapter of his book entitled The Smaller Work on Salvation, he puts forward a case very similar to that of Aquinas, and probably derived from the same Aristotelian sources, for the existence of God in terms of a need for a Prime Mover, who is the cause of all effects but not himself the effect of any cause. The proposition that God exists, he holds,.is as obvious as, if not more so than, the proposition that the Sun exists. The difference is that the latter is clear to the senses whereas the former is clear to the reason. To free reason from its veils and reach the knowledge of God and the real, i.e., spiritual world, requires discipline. And who lacks reason is debarred from apprehension of God's existence, as a bat from the lack of the appropriate sensory faculties is debarred from an apprehension. of the Sun's existence. (See H6imid, 1946). Here we meet the thesis familiar in other contexts, that failure of an opponent to agree on the nature of the phenomena under discussion must be attributed to a gap in his perception, and not to error in the original identification.</page><page sequence="8">32 RAYMOND FIRTH additions relating to emotional content, to give the concept of a personal God what he termed value as well as logical validity. But he surpassed himself by proving by the same line of reasoning that if God marks the upper limit of our conceptions there must be a corresponding lower limit. Rather disconcerted, he concludes that this can only be the Devil. With some relief he affirms that this Devil is not personal, though the impersonal devil, or evil, must be reckoned as eternal. At this point his courage cracks a little and he almost begs to be proved wrong. "I confess," he says " to being uncomfortable over my deduction from Anselm's argument, but perhaps my critics will show that the reality of the devil is after all only a pseudo-reality "-a regulative notion, in distinction from the reality of God (Cock, 1918, p. 20). But ever since Kant's powerful attack, the case for thinking that God's existence can be inevitably demonstrated by reasoning from basic propositions about mind or matter has been greatly weakened. C. C. J. Webb has pointed out that " the proofs of the existence of God which were so important a factor in the eighteenth century defence of religion are now very largely discredited." In carefully weighed terms he continues " it is vain to suppose that, apart from some specifically religious experience in our hearer we can, so to say, force religion upon a reluctant mind by means of such reasonings."6 And J. L. Stocks (1934, pp. 19-20) indicates the singular character of the assertion of the existence of God on a priori grounds. " The proofs themselves rest on the uniqueness of their problem." The logical arguments put forward for the existence of God have always in religious history been supported also by the appeal to empirical experience. Events in the external world have been regarded as counter- signing, so to speak, -the evidence provided on other grounds. Such events are of two types-normal and miraculous. In all religions which base part of their claim to recognition upon the purity of their ethical principles, witness to their truth is sought in the conduct of those who follow their doctrines. Each of the major religions has its saints, whose lives have been marked by an extreme of piety, self- abnegation, and moral refinement. But each has been able to count also multitudes of ordinary adherents who have shown such control of themselves and such care for their fellow men that it is concluded 6 Webb (1929, pp. 36-40). He proceeds indeed to draw a comparison between the recalcitrance of such a hearer and resistance to poetry or music in a soul incapable of aesthetic emotions. But this is an imperfect analogy since only in a figurative way is it ever suggested that aesthetic expression carries within it any qualities of a personal supra-human kind akin to those claimed for religioa. they could only be animated by belief of a true kind. One of the arguments put forward not merely for the superiority but also for the correctness of Christian belief, for instance, is the general character of the achievements of Western civilization in liberating men from physical and mental bonds. However, it is difficult for even those who maintain such views to regard them as conclusive or final evidences for the truth of the religion concerned. The achievements of Christian like those of other religious organizations have often been base as well as noble. And men of pure life with ethical systems of a lofty selfless kind are not the prerogative of any one religious faith. In fact many modern theologians are coming to acknowledge that the social influence of Christianity is not the prime argument for its validity, that it is only a by-product. Its aim of promoting social justice on this view, if not illusory, is certainly secondary. The world is impermanent ; it is the future, the eternal, that should be sought, by the road to salvation through faith and grace. The argument of evidence from miracle seems to be at present in a transitional state-at least as far as Christian circles go. Whereas a century ago sceptics were few, there are probably now large numbers of professing Christians who believe that most if not all of the miracles described in the Scriptures are at best allegorical. Miracle, by definition, is an event which stands outside the ordinary processes of nature, is remarkable for its discontinuity, and is not explain- able by physical principles. As has often been pointed out-if we could explain it, it would not be a miracle. Nevertheless there is an attempt to reconcile modern scientific views with Scriptural account as far as possible. This takes three forms. The first is to waive any idea of physical anomalies or variations from natural laws and to treat a miracle as a symbol- an account in terms of physical behaviour of what was in fact mental behaviour. On this view the miracle of feeding the hungry multitude from a small quantity of loaves and fishes is a beautiful story illustrating the importance of compassion, the virtues of sharing, and the way in which the effects of a gift are multiplied manifold. Another view is that the Scriptural account describes an actual event, but in terms somewhat different from what in fact must have happened. Ritchie's explanation, for example, is that the crowd had come to hear the Master already furnished with provender concealed about their garments. But in the character of suspicious Oriental peasantry they were unwilling to take out what they had and share with their neighbours. The Master, knowing this, called up to him a small boy; then, breaking up and dividing the food, by his personal magnetic example He induced the crowd to follow</page><page sequence="9">Religious Belief and Personal Adjustment 33 suit. The miracle lay not in multiplication of the food itself, but in dissipating suspicion and securing co-operation from the hard-bitten, slow-moving peasant assembly (Ritchie, 1945, pp. 73-4). Still another view is that which tries to save the miracle by an appeal to modern science. The miracles of healing are thus interpreted as an early use of psycho- therapy. The miracle of the feeding of the five thousand is explained by concepts analogous to those of atomic fission, of which the Master is believed to have had the secret. The following is one view: " That Our Lord in creating the solid matter of which the food was formed had at His intuitive disposal and control the vast energy which we now know to have been necessary, gives to the Christian believer a new realisation of His power, and to the unbeliever a further difficulty " (Thornton, 1930, p. 27). Within the whole range of miracles there are, however, 'grades in what is treated as matter for belief. Many who give credence to Biblical miracles deny this to the miracles recorded since Apostolic times, regarding them as not supported by evidence of the same weight. The newer the miracle, the less it is believed. Even within the New Testament range a distinction is drawn between such ancillary events as the feeding of the multitude and the cardinal events of the Virgin Birth and the Resurrection. That which is central to the whole religious system cannot be so easily abandoned, however incredible it may seem. The surest course to adopt is that which has been hallowed by long usage-to believe even though it is incredible. " Strange to all our experience and inscrutable to all our science " as one writer has put it, such stupendous miracles are part of the attraction of faith. Belief in them is part of the test of faith itself. Credo quia absurdum becomes a matter of pride. In the last resort, it is not intellectual or moral proofs for belief in the existence of God, or in other religious concepts that have prime validity; it is the emotional proofs. This was demonstrated more than a century ago by the German theologian Schleiermacher. Seeing the inadequacy of basing evidences for the truth of Christianity upon human rea-son alone, he developed the theme of the impor- tance of man's feeling of dependence on God. This to him was the true basis of dogma. An essentially similar view, it will be remembered, was put forward aM the basis of religion on scientific grounds by Rad- cliffe-Brown in his lecture in this series three years agol' But basing belief on emotion, on non-rational 7William James (1929, p. 27) has argued that this is onJy one of many sentiments which can be put as the, basis of religion. attachment of the will, does not mean suspension or abnegation of all reasoning processes. This can be so even in the acceptance of miracles. The view that the events described as miracles actually happened because the Gospel record is based on eye-witness or near eye-witness accounts is interesting. Every anthropologist is familiar with the miracles of magic, faith-healing, spirit-mediumnship, and ancestral inter- vention-apparently much better authenticated from contemporary sources. What impresses is not the value of the evidence adduced. But the mental attitude on the 'part of the believer indicates the strength of the need that is felt for support to what is believed. It is felt that there should be some demonstration of relation between antecedent and consequent. In the case of the Resurrection, veri- fication is at times held to lie in experiences of the disciples, transmitted to other followers who wrote their words down. The believer in the miracle thus transfers his reasoning-he abandons any attempt to place the event in a physical order, since it is charac- terised by discontinuity in natural process. But he sets it in the framework of a rational human order by relying on a case for the credibility of witnesses and faithfulness of the written record. Suggestion has even been made that the evidence would bear scru-tiny comparable with that given in a modemn court of law. My point is here that belief is emotionally b4sed but intellectually supported. Its use as part of the processes of personal adjustment requires that the emotion be organised in an intellectual or para- intellectual system. The furthest removes from this are the emotional extremes of frenzy (such as that following on, say, bereavement) or of transcendental mysticism. It is symptomatic of the general attitudes of believers that though the same propositions of belief may be shared, there is often an attempt to restrain the exhibition of transports of emotion by others. And among writers on religion who are primarily concerned with intellectual analysis, there is a tendency to deprecate any ranking of transcendental mysticism too high on the scale of religious experience (Webb, 1929, p. 8; Temple, 1924). On the other hand there is the simple attitude of the intuitional claim-" I believe because I know." In this, as for example in the identification of the object of knowing with a transcendent Being, there is a refusal to carry the intellectual analysis beyond an affirmation. But let us continue with the arguments which buttress faith. In line with modern ideas of development is the view that God is being made known to man more exactly and completely by progressive revelation.</page><page sequence="10">34 RAYMOND FIRTH Few Christians will go so far, perhaps, as to admit that the nature of God himself may have changed from that of a jealous tribal god to one of love for all humanity, even though it is one implication from the Biblical record.8 But only the most ardent Funda- mentalist nowadays will maintain that the days of the Creation were spaces of twelve hours or so between dawn and dusk, that man was formed of the dust of the ground, and woman from one of the ribs of man, and that the Lord God walked in the cool of one evening in a garden, eastward in Eden, which had a tree giving the fruits of the knowledge of good and evil.9 The argument for progressive revelation is used in two ways. One way is in buttressing the general validity of religion, while meeting the difficulty of the existence of a diversity of faiths or creeds, each claiming to have the sole key to the truth., If all are wrong but the one championed by the particular believer, then intellectually doubt may creep in as to the possibility of error in that one. But if all are admitted to have in some measure a partial revelation of the Divine, then, to some types of minds at least, it becomes easier to think that one's own faith must be right, and being so is the closest to the truth. The argument can be applied even to the religious conceptions of the people of the simpler societies, often formerly dismissed as absurd by Christian missionaries. Thus a few years ago the Moderator of the Presbyterian Assembly in New Zealand, in opening the annual conference spoke of the ancient Maori conception of Jo-represented by European scholars as the supreme god-as remarkable. In his view it " could only be accounted for by the statement that, while they felt after Him in the darkness, God's spirit revealed to them as much of the Divine nature as could be conveyed to men in their stage of development."10 Such an opinion reflects the speaker's conviction of his church's own attain- ment. But the reverse attitude can also be emphasised. The second way of using the argument for progres- sive revelation is in emphasising the relativity of our own present knowledge, and so warding off criticism. This may be of two kinds. Internal criticism alleges that a change or development in interpretation of 8 This idea is dramatically and movingly expressed in Marc Connelly's play Green Pastures, which symbolises God learning from experience-specifically, the experience of suffering. See also the preface to the play by Vincent Long. 9 The metaphorical nature of beliefs formerly held as- literal, for example the spatial notions of heaven' and hell expressed in the Apostles' Creed, is examined by Ritchie (1945, pp. 75-). 10 Rev. J.- G. Laughton, as reported in the Auokland Weekly News, Nov. 18th, 1942 doctrine is not an improvement but a perversion, a heresy. External criticism alleges that changes in doctrine are still further evidence that the religion as a whole is a human fabrication-that what are claimed as refinements in understanding the spiritual world are nothing but inevitable adjustments to the flux of events in the material world. The notion of progressive revelation meets both these attacks. One of the most brilliant achievements in the use of this concept to face internal criticism is given by the Lotus Sutra, the Mahayana Buddhist text. It would appear that this work had in its inception no direct connexion with the Buddha, that though it purports to present the words of the Eternal Saviour, his last testament before his departure, it was composed long, perhaps centuries, after his death. Its essential teaching, salvation by faith, is in flat opposition to the ideas of attainment of Nirvana by self-discipline and good works, which are the essence of the older orthodox Hinayana teaching. The Lotus Sutra, in a series of mystical revelations, discloses through the mouth of the Buddha himself how he had hitherto used the narrow way of doctrine of salvation by works as a preparatory piece of enlighten- ment, reserving the broad way of salvation by faith for the ultimate gift of knowledge. When asked why he should have first taught and then repudiated the Hinayana doctrines, the Buddha answers that he has had to preach the Law as might be expedient. Sinful ignorant men would not have been able to understand the full and wonderful truth at once and therefore he had to use appropriate tactful methods. The Buddha reinforces his argument by the parable of the Burning House. A father sees his children playing about inside, heedless of his warnings, and in danger of buLrning to death. He lures them outside by promises of rich toys which for the moment he does not have. Overjoyed, they all run outside. Then, when they are in safety, he takes his time and prepares for them the gifts he described. In the Sutra, all his hearers assent that the Buddha's intention and his gift of redemption remove from him ali taint of falsehood-that his explanation justifies his message (Soothill, 1930, Introduction and Chapter II). The history of the great religions is full of such arguments of progressive revelation. Christianity uses them to justify itself against Judaism; Islam uses them against Judaism and Christianity both. In the early 19th century they were used against Islam in Persia by the reformer Saiyid 'Ali Muhammed of Shiraz. As El Bab, The Door, he put forward what was in effect a new set of religious doctrines about the unity and attributes of God. To the Comte de Gobineau, now rather under a cloud because of his ill-judged essay on the inequality of the races of man,</page><page sequence="11">Religious Belief and Personal Adju8tment 35 but a sociological observer of acute penetration nevertheless, we owe a valuable record and analysis of the new faith,, and its relation to the old. Accord- ing to Gobineau, the Bab purported to give not a new conception of the Deity, but only a further develop- ment of the knowledge of the Divine nature. All the prophets successively, he argued, had stated more on this subject than their predecessors were com- missioned to do. It was only in accordance with this regular progress that the Bab had had entrusted to him a task more complete than that of Mohammed, which was more complete than that of Jesus, who in turn had known more than his precursors (Gobineau, 1933, p. 284; Huart, 1941). 'Ali Muhammed, the Door or Mirror of God, met a fate not unlike that of an earlier prophet who had claimed a new revelation; he was put to death by the authorities as an outrage to the orthodox faith and a threat to civil order. The idea that the revelation of fundamental truths is progressive is a valuable defence against external challenge. It can always be held that what is being attacked is in fact not the real or complete explana- tion, but only a partial, perhaps even distorted version. The critic thus spends himself fighting a phantom adversary while the real protagonist, the truth in its blinding entirety, will reveal herself, if ever, only at a later time.'1 When the idea of progressive revelation is linked with that of ultimate incomprehensibility in this life of the final religious truths, then the argument of belief takes on one of its strongest forms.,. Negatively, it is an aid to rejection of the charge that anthropomorphic concepts of the Divine are an indication that God is man-made. If the ultimate reality transcends man's capacity for understanding, then how otherwise can he express his attitudes than by using the terminology and concepts of his own experience ? Positively, it strengthens the cali for faith. If in this world our knowledge is incomplete and our understanding is difficult, the greater is the importance of a faith which holds before us the complete realization of the mystery in the life to come, be it Nirvana, or union with the Divine.'2 This brings us to the threshold of the perennial dispute as to the relations between religion and science. We are not concerned here to evaluate carefully the respective views, but primarily to indicate their sociological - relevance to an under- standing of religious belief. The basic religious attitude is to protect its sphere of faith and ritual from what is regarded as unjustified encroachment by the principles of reason, particularly reason in what is expressed as the materialistic doctrines exemplified by science. The term science ordinarily refers both to a body of knowledge and to a set of methods of investigation. By religion the body of knowledge is nowadays usually accepted, while the competence of the set of methods to pursue knowledge into the religious sphere is denied. But methods of enquiry must start from assumptions about the nature of reality, and here is the fundamental diver- gence. Three main standpoints may be mentioned- that matter is the ultimate reality; that mind is the ultimate reality; that mind, as ultimate reality, has qualities of an extra-human or supra-human order, such as omniscience, omnipotence or power of incarna- tion. Different scientists adopt different standpoints on this. Some for example do hold that there is a non-empirical reality or sphere of thought, with which a logical-empirical analysis cannot cope.'3 But recognition of this need not imply the recognition of that supra-human mind or power, which for religion is the essential assumption. And what some scientists take as assumptions, together with a real or imagined body of knowledge and set of methods is in popular usage lumped together and given a quasi-personal, "The value of the conception of progressive revelation from this point of view has been understood by Ritchie (1945, pp. 75-6) who states " Unless God is now in process of being revealed to us, whatever revelation there may have been in the past, we must inevitably be atheists. The atheists are those to whom God does not reveal Himself or who reject His revelation." 12 This point of view is epitomised by St. Paul: " Now we see through a glass darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as I am known." The Buddhist Avatamsakasutra, a canonical text of the Hosso and Kegon sects, puts it thus: "How exquisite is our physical eye, It has not the power to ?ee our condition, The affirmation of its power betrays an illusion, And it is inapt to understand -th6 incomparable Law .... The Perfect Law of al the Buddhas is incomprehensible. For it surpasses the power of our comprehension . . .. Believe in Buddha with the simplicity of thy heart, Be unshakable in thy faith.. Enter in the torrent of Buddhism, To reach the beauty and the calm of Wisdom." (Steinilber-Oberlin, 1938, pp. 285-6). Cf. also the Nichiren view that in the present period, which is one of degeneracy, " we are now too corrupt to understand alone the whole light of the Buddha. An act of faith in the sacred text! which is suitable for the men of our time is necessary." (Steinilber-Oberlin, 1938, p. 241.) 13 In the social sciences the existence of observer-effect, the participation of the observer as an element in many situations being studied, complicates the problems of determinate measurement. There are phenom'ena which defy logical and empirical reconstruction-the intuitive processes for instance,,as in that ability to perceive hitherto unnoticed relations and integrate them into a general principle which is the mark of the true scientist. c 2</page><page sequence="12">36 RAYMOND FIRTH almost magical value. Science in this sense is the voice of authority or that of the false prophets, according to the point of view. The arguments of religious belief in respect of science take a variety of forms. One is to stress the essential relativity of scientific discovery and principles. This is in order to show that the findings of science, apparently incontrovertible, will in the end be superseded, and in particular the firm grasp of science on matters fringing the religious sphere will slip away. The essence of this approach is given by a recent Muslim economist. "My belief," he says, " is that when Quranic theories come into conflict with the modern scientific theories, I find no reason to trouble my conscience. I firmly believe that the science of today may be the mythology of tomorrow, and that what the Quran has said we may not understand today, but it is likely to become quite clear to us tomorrow "14 (Qureshi, 1945, p. 4). Another-instance of the way in which stress on the relativity of scientific knowledge is used as a buttress to religious faith is the cordial reception given to Heisenberg's enunciation of the uncertainty principle.15 This and other discoveries in modern physics which have promoted revision of the classical notions of causal laws and of determinism of a mechanistic kind are thought to prove the case for the ina,dequacy of science to grasp fundamental reality. The universe is thought to be indeterminate, mysterious, something more than matter.16 But as Susan Stebbing (1937, passim), has shown, with humour and skill, the physicists' discoveries warrant no such conclusions. Neither idealism nor materialism can benefit. Nor would it seem to follow that the less we know about the seen world the more therefore we know about the unseen world. Another form of the argument is a denial of the competence of science to pronounce on matters which are regarded as falling within the province of religion. This view is met not only among the professed exponents of religious doctrines, but also among philosophers and among scientists themselves. The 14 It will be observed that it is not argued that the Koran's ideas of today may become the mythology of tomorrow. 15 One gathers that by this the more accurate the deter- mination of the position of an electron, the greater is the uncertainty as to its mnomentum; conversely, the more accurately its momentum is determined, the greater the uncertainty as to its position. The degree of uncertainty, which is due to the nature of measurement itself, is laid down by Heisenberg's principle, by which it is assigned a value never less than a specified constant. 16 The new physics has " renewed and stimulated a sense of the ontological mystery of the world of matter," (Maritain, 1940 (a), p. 66). real world, it is held, is beyond the shadow-show of space and time. The physical is a manifestation of something other than itself. Religious experience is truly objective, not merely subjective. Contem- porary science, including sociology and anthropology, is incapable of passing judgement on any theory concerning the super-sensory or transcendental world, with which religious and philosophical thought deals (Brown, 1946, pp. 35-7, 39, etc. ; Wach, 1947, pp. 4-5, 14; Sorokin, 1941, vol. 4, p. 296). A further buttress to religious belief is to claim the reverse-that religion is only another form of science. Made in the most blatant form it is that a religious system is founded on scientific principles primarily because it purports to argue in terms of cause and effect. One such system is Christian Science, alleging that illness, pain and sin can be made to disappear by using the laws of mind properly. Another, an intellectual variety of Saivaism, claims the law of universal causation as its basic postulate. Since this is regarded as being the very foundation of Western science, Saivaism is hailed as embodying the counterpart of the most modern scientific theories of the West. Another view represents science as essentially a part of religion because both are a quest for knowledge and truth in a disinterested way (Fisher, 1933, pp. 62-72, 76 et passim; Shivapadasundaram, 1934, p. 14). An interesting example of the way in which a scientist has worked out his personal adjustment in religious terms comes from an eminent professor of electrical engineering. For him, -God is a finite Being, conforming to the laws of mechanics. He has the ether as His abode, and as part of His nature. The visible material universe is God's kenosis, the shedding of part of Himself, part of His output of energy. From these views, rather unorthodox, certain corollaries emerge. If God has surrendered part of Himself in creating matter, is it perhaps true that there is some slight justification for the perception of an inner spirit in wood and stone ? If the wisdom and foreknowledge of God apply to the laws by which action takes place, and not to the predestination of every fact or event, then must even God try out the laws which He has framed ? Can He perhaps not foresee or intend to foresee their consequences in every variant ? " Is He in truth as Creator the Supreme Researcher ? " it is argued. " Is the chemist who makes the compound hitherto unknown or a biologist who succeeds in making new variations of a species, carrying on the work of God as He would have it done ? " (Thornton, 1930, pp. 17-18, 23). Another variant on the same theme is to represent science as only of limited adequacy in its ordinary form and as needing enlargement to take in factors which religion wishes to include in the world view.</page><page sequence="13">Religiou8 Belief and Personal Adjustment 37 It is argued, for instance that a " bastard" science leaves out all except material factors. "True " science takes into account the eternal verities, such as character and conscience, religious instinct, parental, conjugal or patriotic love. These cannot be weighed, analysed, dissected, but cannot be excluded from "true " science.' 7 All these points of view indicate different modes of adjustment whereby, sometimes in most elaborate imaginative constructions, attempts are made to place the facts of emotion within an intellectual system. But whether religion is made to oppose science or to absorb science, the issue needs clarifica- tion. Science has as its hall-marks the formulation of hypotheses, testing of them by observation and experiment, and careful relation of conclusions to empirical data. In its use of analytical thought, it must always work with given premisses. It is unable to pronounce with certainty on the nature of ultimate reality. From its methods, it is debarred from mere assertion, unsupported by that degree of probability which is ordinarily held to constitute proof. But religion feels no necessity for such limitation. In its certitude lies its strength. It constantly makes assertions about the nature of reality. The proofs produced rest either on argument of which the logic is highly debatable or on further assertion about the intuitive nature of the revelation or other experiences of a special order adduced as evidence. Even where the data are regarded as capable of empirical examination by an external observer, the initial premisses supplied in the inter- pretation are usually in excess of those which are, the necessary minimum. No social science may be able to prove or disprove the reality of such religious categories as God, devil, heaven or angels, apart from their existence as human concepts. But it can certainly show the way in which such concepts can be seen to be consistent with much in human wants and behaviour alone. Revelation and mystical experience, for instance, whether regarded as proceed- ing from an external supra-human source or not, are fundamentally human states. As such they can be analysed and interpreted with significance from the scientific point of view. The anthropologist, like any other scientist, has to base his work upon some assumptions of a metaphysical order. Whatever metaphysical position he adopts it must be such as. to allow him the greatest freedom of exploration of the whole range of phenomena of man's behaviour. 17 e.g., Bishop Walter Carey, in an article entitled " Can We ever Think Clearly ? " SSunday Di8patch. 1st September, 1946. Freedom is a word which every system nowadays, however authoritarian, likes to inscribe on its banners. And there are other old labels too, which are borne on unaccustomed packages. Freedom is held out as a promise by what has been called the new humanism. It is exemplified in the work of Jacques Maritain, in whom the neo-Thomists have a philosophical publicist of great eloquence. The classical humanism, he argues, had an anthropocentric idea of man and culture-the idea of human nature as selfjenclosed or self-sufficient. This it put forward instead of what Maritain would term an open nature and an open reason-which are man's real nature and his real reason. The classical attitude towards human existence has been that of the isolation of reason from all that is supra-rational and irrational in man. Its reaction inevitably has been the counter-humanism of Kierkegaard and Karl Barth with its emphasis on personal anguish.18 The new humanism as conceived by Maritain is of a Christian order; he has termed it " the humanism of the Incarnation," integral and progressive. It is claimed as springing from the concrete logic of the events of history. It involves the conception of the wholeness of man in his natural and supernatural being and of the descent of the divine into man. Faith supplies the key to fundamental questions of being; the supra-rational is regarded as equally essential as the rational in the interpretation and government of human affairs. This new humanism, it is argued, has its implications not merely for the religious life of the believer. It is conceived as an attitude and doctrine of far-reaching importance- even as affecting our own anthropological science. " The new humanism," he says, " must reassume in a purified climate all the work of the classical period; it must re-make anthropology, find the rehabilitation and the ' dignification ' of the creature not in isolation, not in the creature shut in with itself, but in its openness to the world of the divine and supra- rational." (Maritain, 1940 (b), p. 9). This is only one of a group of tendencies which seek to demonstrate the inadequacy of reason not merely for an approach to human contacts and relations with the external world as part of man's everyday behaviour, but also as a mode of analysis of phenomena. One expects to find a championing of the irrational in the sphere of art, where the emphasis upon feeling as a guide and stimulus to 18 "4 The terrible voices which rise up in man crying out Enough of lying optimism and illusory moralities .... . of liberty . . . . of idealism; take us back to the great spiritual fruitfulness of the abyss, of the absurd, arLd of the ethics of despair."' (Maritain, 1940 (b), p. 5.) c 3</page><page sequence="14">38 RAYMOND FIRTH aesthetic activity has always been paramount. The abandonment of the mediaeval artist's sub- jective attitude to his material in favour of a naturalism derived from the remnants of classical antiquity led inevitably, it is held, to a degeneration of art. By taking nature first as an inspiration for creative form and then as a model the artist was led to become a copyist. As the Church progressively lost her spiritual initiative in Europe the artist progressively became freer from mysticism and religious iconography. In the Renaissance political system this did lead to some of the finest products of art. But the inevitable outcome of this classicism was the translation of the artist into the artisan.19 But the historian also can exemplify the same attitude. Arnold Toynbee in his monumental study of culture argues that criteria of the growth of civilisation are not to be found in increasing command over the human or the physical environment. This, the evidence suggests, is a concomitant of disintegra- tion rather than of growth because of a decline in the spiritual forces which make for purpose and unity. The proper saviour from a disintegrated society is not to be found in the philosophy of detachment like that of Buddhist or Stoic. It is the " mystery of transfiguration" which alone can work as- the effective agent-the God incarnate in a man. This, he argues, represents a truth which we can verify empirically but which is also known to us intuitively.20 One suspects also that recent work by the psychologists on precognition and extra-sensory perception attracts attentioni for its religious bearing rather than for its scientific interest. This derives ultimately from the hope that negatively these conclusions will place limitations on the claims for the exercise of reason and positively they will encourage belief in the existence of the world of the supra-rational, including forces and powers which religion alone can claim to control. In the history of religious belief in Europe it would seem such currents can be traced for the last three hundred years. C. C. J. Webb and others have pointed out how in the 1Sth century the idea of God was that of a transcendent Being having a separate existence from the Universe and from man, and standing over sharply against man as the Creator of omnipotent and omniscient power. With the change which the scientists initiated in the idea that cosmic process was to be viewed in terms of evolution rather than of creation, came also the idea of God 19 See e.g., Mazenod (1943). 20 "C So far as this Civitas Dei enters into the time- dimension at all . . . .it is as a spiritual reality interpene- trating the present." Toy'nbee (1946, pp. 527-9). as immanent, a Being permanently pervading the Universe and in a sense an integral part of the life of the world and man. It was not out of the question that God for the accomplishment of His own purposes was prepared to limit Himself in both power and knowledge, and to participate through His world substance in the evolutionary process. Man, as a. semi-autonomous creature, could take part, so to speak, in working out the designs of'God. Salvation. and human happiness could be sought in the world which represented the evolution of the Great Design. As time has passed, the early glories of the industrial revolution have begu'n to fade. First one and then another great war have shaken the fabric of civilization and all established social order has been challenged' to its roots by the Marxist state. Correspondingly the tendency to seek religious values within civilization has begun once again to be regarded as fallacious. The sense of other-worldliness has once more come to be looked upon by many as fundamental in religion. Reinforced by arguments based upon the primacy of feeling, the value of irrationality, and the claims of mystical experience to a validity apart from their subject, this may be described as the new transcendentalism.21 What is to be the anthropological attitude towards this development ? Must we look forward to see our science re-made in the light of this approach which, novel in some of its formulations, carries nevertheless the kernel of age-old argument. I suggest that, as- before, the anthropologist can only take man as the centre of his study. -Emotion, unreason, belief, intuitive knowledge and mystical perception, may all. be regarded as modest or -bases of action for the individuals'to whom they seem appropriate in given. circumstances. But they must be regarded as essentially modes of personal adjustment and not as scientific instruments. The rational dispassionate analysis which the anthropologist applies to religious phenomena and in which his own position as the analyst is reduced to a minimum, even though it cannot be eliminated, must still remain our guide. If this be so it appears to me that the range of phenomena we have been discussing can find an explanation -not inconsistent with the point of view which I presented to you at the beginning' of this lecture. These phenomena-views on theism, theodicy, and progressive revelation; theo-symbolism and its inversion-;- belief in the insufficiency -of scientific knowledge and in the integral character of- the new humanism-are not all aspects 'of reality beyond the scientist's perception. They are modes of grappling with a reality which is open to observation. 21 See for example the illuminating essay by Webb (1929).</page><page sequence="15">Religious Belief and Personal Adjustment 39 though by no means adequately measureable by scientific knowledge-at least in the present state of our technique. What is this reality ? It is the individual human being himself, in relation to the physical world of which he has cognisance and the society of which he is a member. Man has to face the reality of his own mental make-up, with all its conflicting desires, emotions, intellectual drives and moral sentiments. He prefers to do so in a mirror. The value of religious belief to him is in meeting his own personal wants. It provides him with a means of reacting in a range of social situations where without it he would be severely hampered. His belief supplies him also with a principle of order- order in his relation to his fellows, including the moral norms he follows, and order in his conception of the universe. This search for an external order in events and things demands that their relationships to one another can be recognised as intelligible and not merely fortuitous association. The principle of order deals with time as well as space ; it can comprise even eternity. In the view of such universalistic religion it is this which imakes the eternal order authentic. But it is not merely order, it is the assurance that we know where to find guidance upon that order that is desired. Religious belief supplies also a principle of authority or certitude upon which indecision and the need' for resolution can seize. The relation of son to father, believer to Church, man to God all exemplify the op'eration of this principle, in which wisdom is believed to reside in a superior, into whose hands the inferior resigns the decision. Religious belief also provides objects of attachment for sentiments of dependence and affection. Belief is a comforter in time of trouble. It can also serve as a vehicle for the transports of ecstatic love. This iInvolves not merely self-expression in the sense of ability to give vent to creative interests. It also involves opportunity to exercise those self-regarding sentiments which are part of the personal constitution. There must be outlet, too, for what we may call the " other-regarding " sentiments, of which there must be at least a minimal exercise for any social existence. All this gives occasion for emphasis upon individu- ality. The relation of the mystic to the Divine with which he seeks union may seem to negate this stress. Yet in all such cases there is emphasis upon the uniqueness of the experience, the particularity of it, as being incapable of being grasped by another person-except perhaps by a mystic who has attained the same state. A heightened consciousness of personality in social matters then is correlated with the claim to a merging of personality on the supra- rational plane. It is precisely by that capacity of being united with the Divine essence, of grasping reality direct, that the mystic feels he is singled out from his fellows. Over the whole range of religious belief, stress upon the personal relation of God to man is a marked feature. It helps to satisfy that desire for personal recognition and personal assertion which is germinal in every one of us. It can serve also those attitudes which, springing from an enlightened self-regarding sentiment, demand the application of principles- of equity and justice to the results of conduct. Religious belief usually embodies some concepts whereby behaviour is related to a scheme of consequents, whether or not these are interpreted in terms of moral approbation or dis- approbation, and of reward or punishment. Religious belief also offers a prospect for him who is curious for truth. Many things which science and common- sense knowledge cannot provide, religion offers as certainties. If one cannot know the truth by reason one must know it by faith. Certitude, rest from the internal dialectical battle, from the effort of grappling with inconsistencies and half-answers, is undoubtedly one of the great attractions in religious belief. One can always painfully build up one's own ideas, but a framework already put up makes the work much easier. This has always been recognised. Reason and the delights of logical argument, too, find their place in religious belief. TherPe may be disagreement about the extent to which the assumptions from which the analysis starts are data ascertained by experience. But the highest philosophical and dialectical skill can be developed whatever the basis. The intellect can thus be satisfied by the intricacies of formulating and defending religious belief even while it professes to rely on and find truth in other instruments. This analysis is not an argument in metaphysics nor an essay in the scholarship of comparative religion. It treats some characteristic types of beliefs in a variety of religious systems as modes of adaptation. This is not to deny Durkheim's contri- bution in relating religious symbols to social forms, nor that of Max Weber in showing how different personal solutions of an integrative kind are, to be found in different systems of religious thought.22 But it is important to show how religious belief can be related to the structure of personality, 'not merely to social structure. It is an instrument in the main- tenance of personal integration, not simply of social integration. And, to get the stamp of conviction, belief must fit somehow into a personal intellectual system, not only into an emotional system. Denying reason with one breath, faith seeks with the next to 22 See the illuminating commentary of Talcott Parsons (1944, pp. 176-190). c 4</page><page sequence="16">40 RAYMOND FIRTEI produce the final compelling reason to justify its own primacy. In all this, every individual has his own adjust- ment-points, every belief its own adjustment-values. To a Tyrolese peasant what appeals is God as a simple family Father of a patriarchal, somewhat overbearing type, with the Madonna as a kindly protectress and intercessor, to be represented, as in one homely image, with a cosmic umbrella sheltering herself and the Child, while their suppliants pay their devotions. Not for the peasant the conceptions that meet the intellectual needs of a professor of electrical engineer- ing, with God as the supreme expression of the laws of mechanics, as the research mind in excelsis. The more . highly elaborate the social organization the greater the diversity of situations open to individuals for resolution, and the greater possible range of adjustment-points. The diversity of religious belief tends to increase as science develops. The logico- empirical system of scientific thought can destroy belief-but it can also develop it, stimulate it to erect new variants to buttress itself. Understanding of these processes is essential in the study of how change in religious belief comes about. New facts are always being presented to individual experience, and new interpretations of experience are always being suggested. There is the impact of the behaviour of fresh personalities, or of known personalities in new situations. New verbalizations of experience are always being demanded. A refusal to make adjustment may lead to heightened emphasis on the customary expressions of belief. But fresh defences are also built up. Wittingly or unwittingly these become substantial alterations to the corpus of belief in the individual religious armoury. With diversification of the types of situation to be met by an individual, so is there diversification of expression of belief. The anthropologist's concept of a specific belief is a summation of individual views, an abstraction of time-place expressions. The beliefs of even the most primitive religious system are always mobile, sensitive to changes in external circumstances or in social composition. Primitive religion, contrary to a common view23 is not devoid of sceptics, heretics, and other unorthodox who have had to meet a personal intellectual or emotional challenge by individual formulations which diverge from the community norm. When a tribal religion is met by Christianity or by Islam, each with a new social and economic system, it is not only fear and respect for the new God, the perception of a higher morality, or the 23 Expressed even by Malinowski (1925, pp. 57, 64) who is usually so insistent on the importance of individual variation. principles of comparative economic advantage that move to conversion. A more complex set of factors is responsible, involving delicate adjustment in more personal terms. Social relations with community members, the sense of communion itself, the appeal of the new beliefs in a universe of greater scope than hitherto imagined, intellectual conviction of the fitness of the new ideas to explain situations difficult to comprehend, acceptance of the necessity of a new value system-all have weight.24 But the demands on the new beliefs may be different from what was at first envisaged. Hence still newer beliefs arise, attempts at more complete adjustment. We are familiar with the variety of new cults that have sprung up in Africa, North America, New Guinea and elsewhere as congeners of or offshoots from Christianity. They have been termed "nativistic " cults, but they might almost be termed "adjustment-cults." The amount of native rever- sion in them is very variable, while it is their quality of adjustment that is outstanding,.25 They are an attempt to provide an aetiology for new situations of which the implications are but dimly grasped. Something has " gone wrong " with the process of change-the people have adopted Christianity or other Western culture forms, yet the things of the European have not accrued to them. Traditional forms alone are incompatible with new demands, yet they still meet some wants. The beliefs of the new cult, whatever be their precise content, are attempted adjustment to these anomalies. The greater the anomalies, the more fantastic the beliefs-that all Europeans will vanish, leaving their goods behind; that the spirits of the dead will all return to an earthly Elysium; that if there is fighting for the new cult all the faithful are invulnerable. Faith in many of these cults has smashed on reality, when belief in immediate miracle has failed to redeem its promise., But belief has often been plastic enough to make a fresh adjustment, by buttress rather than by complete modification. I do not deny the value of Malinowski's theory of religion as satisfying basic human needs, especially that for personal continuity-" building out heaven beyond the grave," in William James's expression. But this theory needs re-formulation. It does not explain why change of belief takes place, how con- version, heresy and apostasy can occur. The views of Radcliffe-Brown need qualification in the same 24 Allier (1925, vol. 1, p. 525) argues that conversion does not consist in intellectual conviction-but that such con- viction must necessarily follow if the conversion is not to be sooner or later only a memory of violent though fleeting emotions. 25 See e.g., Stanner (1947, pp. 31-34).</page><page sequence="17">Religious Belief and Personal Adjustment 41 -way. The function of ritual, he argues, is in the perpetuation of sentiments-especially the prime one of dependence-on which the maintenance of society depends. But if an ancestral cult, for instance, expresses this, why does it not continue, no matter what be the change in external events ? The ancestors do not change; in time of stress, then, why not appeal even more to them, and cling to them ? Emile Nolly has given in his novel La Barque Annamite a skilful analysis of the desperate attach- ment of an old man to his ancestral cult in the face of the new forces of civilization. But this fails to satisfy the hopes, thwarted passions and new interests of his dearest kin. The basic human needs in such a case are still there; the response is inadequate, fails to satisfy intellectually as well as emotionally the demands of the individual in the changed environ- ment, The Tikopia, among whom I worked when Christianity and some Western cultural items had already gained a foothold, are a case in point. Christian and heathen all still had a sense of depen- dence on their ancestors, and all participated in some minimal ancestral rites. But differential reaction to the new wants and opportunities emerged not only in conversions, but also in modification of the beliefs of different heathen. Some defended their ancient faith stoutly, others placed God in the native deity system. Some assigned supernatural powers to the Bishop and other Europeans, and some produced versions of myths which accounted for the distribution of iron, the basic- endowment which distinguished between Tikopia and European. Such new developments of belief show adjustment in terms of rational logical thought as well as of emotional reaction. So trenchant was the attack of Durkheim, Marett and others on the early anthro- pologists for over-intellectualization of religion, that emphasis has tended to be placed almost entirely on the elements of feeling and emotion in belief. Reason, it is claimed, cannot destroy faith. I would argue that it can. Faith buttresses itself. But what may be termed the covert atheism of large numbers of p-utative Christians is evidence of some rational inference as to the incompatibility between traditional religion and contemporary social and economic circumstances. I think that the implications of what I have said necessitate some change in the emphases of current anthropological views on religion. Clearly, religion is much more than a sentiment-carrier for society. The hypothesis that religion is an integrating force is more closely applicable to the simpler than to the more highly complex societies. With social and economic differentiation religion often becomes a b-anner for sectionalism. Society is split, not welded together by religious development. Individual inter- pretations of accepted religious truths find backing from others whose personal adjustment-points they meet, and emerge in modifications of dogma and rite. Temperamental differences are reflected there too. The history of schism, sectarianism, heresy, of conservative and modernist movements, of ascetic groups and those to whom austerity has no appeal all give evidence of such tendencies. The establish- ment of a religious organization may rend the society by the creation of monopoly or strong vested interests in social and economic affairs. Religious enterprise may drive the social order into specific channels-as the role of monastic institutions in commerce affected the development of capitalism in Western Europe. Religion may also perform an important social role in providing an outlet for individual sentiments, where other institutions in the society may be inadequate. Individual desires for prestige and advancement, incapable of finding temporal channels, turn to religion as a vent. I am not thinking here only of the worldly clerics, like those cardinals displayed in the plays of Webster and James Shirley, with their " purple pride that wants to govern all," the reflection of a long line of priest-politicians. I have in mind rather those who through dogmatic assertion and conviction of righteousness find their imagined level of superiority over their fellows. Social relations may be embittered rather than improved thereby. If social integration be promoted by such behaviour, it is integration by catharsis. A cathartic function of a more creative kind is given by the way in which religion provides a powerful vehicle for assthetic expression. A conventional way of regarding the relation of religion to art is to point to the manner in which religious emotion provides the stimulus to artistic creation. To my mind the reverse is more often the case-religion provides the medium. This is a point of view admirably examined in detail by Yrjb Hirn (1912, passim) who has demon- strated how much of Catholic doctrine results from speculation directed by assthetic aspirations. In general, in a society where religious institutions occupy an important part of the total field, religion may be a recognized means of canalization for assthetic impulses. The trappings of the religion are embellished, the imagery elaborately worked out. Religious belief is externalized as part of the process of a personal adjustment in art, I suspect that Michelangelo's Sistine chapel designs, Bach's cantatas and passion music are good art not because they were inspired by religion; they are religious in theme because when they were created religion was one of the most effective channels and media for the production of good art. The poverty of good religious art at the present time</page><page sequence="18">42 RAYMOND FIRTH is probably the result less of a decline in religious sentiments of inspiration than of the existence of many other avenues for the expression of the artist's creative urge. Similarly religion attempts to provide a framework and supervised outlet for metaphysical and allied speculations. For nearly a thousand years Christendom controlled in Western Europe the intellectual forces which would otherwise have rebounded -on society. It thus acted as a shock- absorber for thought. It would seem indeed that as societies develop, technologically and' economically, institutions other than religion must arise to allow of the exercise of the creative imagination. Other- wise this might burst religion itself apart. This study of religious belief has stressed its importance in the action systems of individuals. It has shown also how essential is this consideration for an understanding of religious change. But what of the ultimate content of belief ? This question though not the subject of enquiry by science, stands behind many of thie enquiries made. If there be an external reality, transcendent, providing its own cause, author of the moral order, and illuminant of the life of man, this would be a significant assumption behind our theories. Phere is a common belief that God. is real -since the effects attributed to Him are real, Whether man exists only in the mind of God, or God exists only in the mind of man, seems to me unproven, and as far as I can judge, unprovable. The evidence produced for a supra-human mind and will is I think of the same order-though- on a high plane-as other anthropological data concerning belief. A preferable and more economical assumption, offering what to me is a greater degree of probability, is that this is all part of man's attempt to make the supreme, final and unique but really unattainable adjustment-the search after the complete formula for the synthesis of human conduct.
