<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEOPHILUS OF ANTIOCH TO AUTOLYCUS ROBERT M. GRANT UNIVERSITY OF THE SOUT3H I. USAGE AND COMPOSITION THE three books to Autolycus of Theophilus of Antioch en- joyed a considerable measure of popularity among later Christian writers. His work was used not only by Greek but also by Latin writers. Eusebius found it in one of the libraries he used, prob- ably at Caesarea;' it was also employed by Methodius, Epi- phanius, Procopius of Gaza, and John of Damascus.2 Novatian, Lactantius and Jerome certainly knew his writings; probably Minu- cius Felix should be added to the list.3 Three manuscripts of the Ad Autolycum survive; two are copies (one incomplete) of a third, an eleventh or twelfth-century manuscript now in Venice.4 In recent years the microscopic investigations of Loofs " have raised a new problem: the relation of Theophilus to Irenaeus. Most students 6 have rejected his arguments without explaining the striking resemblances between the two authors. Let us first examine the dates of Irenaeus' work and of Theophilus'. As for Irenaeus, the five books Adversus haereses were apparently writ- ten in their present order, and Book III was written in the time of Eleutherus (iii 3); but this date is too vague to help us. In Adv. haer. ii.22.2 he refers to a persecution, probably under Marcus Aurelius, who died in the year I80, while another passage (iv.3o.I) perhaps refers to the influence of Marcia upon Com- 'Eusebius, HE iv. 24 (cf. vi. 20. 1, 32. 3). 2N.

Therefore Book II may have been written before 181, Book IV after 182.7 Irenaeus' writing career lasted a long time, if it is possible to date the Epideixis as late as 200. The final publication of Adversus haereses need not be placed very many years earlier. Compared with Irenaeus' orderly work, the apology of The- ophilus is somewhat unsystematic. The first book is an apology complete in itself; he calls it a 610tLXia (II i); it is close to the diatribe. The second book he calls a treatise (o-7'yypapcta); it also could stand alone. The third book is a ;rTrdlvopa, a collection of materials or memoranda.8 It is a composite book; the first fifteen chapters deal with Christian morality, while chapters 16- 29 are concerned with proving Christianity older and truer than all the poets and other writers. The only precise notice for dating these books is found in III 27, where the chronography of Chry- seros the Nomenclator ends with the death of Marcus Aurelius (March 17, 18o). This part of Book III was therefore not fin- ished before that date. About the same time there was a persecu- tion of the Christians (III 30). Here Theophilus may be referring to the martyrdoms at Scilli on July 17, 18o, or to later events. But what of the other books? The self-sufficiency of Book I makes it likely to have been composed first. It may have been Theophilus' first effort. And it is noteworthy that its rationalistic tone is considerably diminished in the other two books. Unfor- tunately the first book provides no clear evidence for its date. The second book develops themes touched upon in the first, and after an attack on pagan gods leads up to an interpretation of the beginning chapters of Genesis. This is reinforced by quota- tions from the Sibylline Oracles and an anthology of Greek poetry. There is no way of dating the book. (The same observation ap- plies to the first half of Book III.) We may conclude that Irenaeus might well have known the first two books Ad Autolycum, but that they are not likely to have formed the core of his own work. In the first place, a de- tailed analysis of the principal passages claimed by Loofs reveals * On these dates see F. Vernet, "St. Ir6nee," Dict. de theol. cath.

In the second place, why would Irenaeus have wanted to use Theophilus' work? The theological outlooks of the two writers are dissimilar. Irenaeus has the peace and cer- titude of a born Christian;9 Theophilus is a convert who has read himself into the church (I i4). Irenaeus stands for what he knows as Christian tradition; o Theophilus seems to be working out his own theology. At the most important point where The- ophilus shows theological originality - his application of the Stoic- Philonic distinction between the Xo'yo0 'vd&amp;LtETro and Xo'yos rrpoxopftK'o to Christ (II 22)- Irenaeus explicitly rejects his idea." In briefly examining the composition and usage of Theophilus' three books we have come to the problem of his work as a theo- logian and apologist. First we shall examine his purely apologetic work, the first book to Autolycus, which was probably his earliest composition along these lines. II. THE FIRST BOOK TO AUTOLYCUS The first book is an example of confused rationalism.'" The- ophilus begins with a broad discussion of the love of truth which he assumes animates Autolycus, and then, turning to his oppo- nent's ironic demand, "Show me your god," impugns his morality. Only the pure in soul (heart, Matt. v.8) can see God. Your sins prevent the eyes of your soul from seeing (1 2). Here Theophilus is reinterpreting the vision of God in terms of the Philonic "eyes of the soul." ' Autolycus cannot see, for he is disobedient to the law of God as set forth in the Decalogue. But he makes another request: "Show me the visible form of your god, since you see." Theophilus replies that the form of God is unspeakable and in- expressible. This idea is a commonplace of Judaism and early 9 T.-A. Audet, "Orientations theologiques chez Saint Irenee," Traditio I (1943), 15ff. 10 Ibid., 22f.

Theophilus seems to be replying to something like the attack of Celsus in Origen, Contra Celsum vi. 66 (p. 53. 4 Glickner).</page><page sequence="4">230 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Christianity; it is found frequently in Philo, and according to John v.37 Jesus tells the Jews that they have never seen the "form" of God. Then follows a series of appellations of God with the corresponding attribute to which each refers. These appellations and attributes were common in Hellenistic Judaism and among early Christian apologists. The whole passage finds a striking parallel in Corp. Herm. ii.I3 (p. 142:8 Scott). At the end of the series Theophilus happens to mention the wrath of God. "Then you will say to me, Is God angry? Very much so" (I 3). This surprising statement, contradictory to the philosophical defi- nitions he is about to give, shows not only his boldness in counter- ing unanimous philosophical opinion,4 but also his incomplete synthesis of philosophical and religious ideas. The next few lines (I 4) sound a great deal like a section from some manual of Stoic theology. But since the Stoic elements and the Jewish elements which follow are so closely connected, he probably found them already fused in Hellenistic Judaism where the ideas had been taken over and interpreted by Philo. God has no beginning, for he is uncreated; he is unchangeable, for he is immortal. He is called God because he placed (rEAKEVaLt) all things in his steadfastness, and because he runs (0ELv); ; Ocv is to run and to move and to be active and to nourish and to foresee and to govern and to make all things live. But he is Lord, because he rules over the uni- verse; Father, because he is before all things; Fashioner and Maker, because he is creator and maker of the universe; Highest, because he is above all; Almighty, because he himself rules and embraces all things. According to Athenagoras the Stoics considered God LOLvaTO', &amp;KIvqTro', avaaXXo,?'roc, as well as 'dyvpTro3 and 'at8to. Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus called God at8to,, while Chrysippus applied the same epithet to Zeus and called him ,O6aproT. These attributes were taken from the Stoics by Philo, who calls God a't6o3, J4oOapTro3, and aTpErrr-o3. Similarly Justin calls God JyYVrq-o3 and da0,aproP . The word alvapXos is apparently not applied to God by Philo, though Leisegang's index is not complete, but it is so applied by Tatian and Clement of Alexandria. Like the other words here used to describe God, it probably comes to Theophilus from Stoicism. One of the etymological meanings of OE, perhaps comes to him from a Jewish source: the derivation from -iOuLt, found as early as Herodotus, was taken over by Philo. But the other meaning, though " Cicero, De offic. iii. 102; M. Pohlenz, Vom Zorne Gottes (Gattingen, 19o09).</page><page sequence="5">THEOPHILUS OF ANTIOCH TO AUTOLYCUS 231 found in Plato, was exploited by Stoics: "Ocovs dicunt (Posidonius and Cleanthes) sidera et stellas rr roof Oewtv id est TrpeXLY quod semper in cursu sint." 15 Then in the last sentence of this quotation Theophilus gives a list of five Hellenistic Jewish names of God: K'ptos, lraTp, 8,fLUovpoYd', 1'uro, o, ravroxp"wp with fairly obvious explanations of each one. With these observations Theophilus touches briefly on creation. First, he believes, his argument can be still further improved by five parallels from the world of nature, four of which come from the Stoics probably through Philo."6 He himself supplies a fifth. God is invisible; so is the soul, the helmsman, the sun, the king. Theophilus' own contribution is the parallel of the seed in the pomegranate (I 5) which reminds us of the Stoic comparison of God to honey in a honeycomb.1 The comparison as he gives it is not seed man quite right, for originally it must have been seedg - man pomegranate God Theophilus has to alter it to avoid identification of God with the world, and it now reads, "thus the whole creation is surrounded by the spirit of God, and the surrounding spirit with the creation is surrounded by the hand of God." But Logos and Sophia are the hands of God in II 18; and in II i o Logos, spirit and Sophia are identified. Let us conclude that Theophilus' idea of the Spirit of God is somewhat unclear, especially in his first book. In the sixth chapter of Book I, Theophilus' style abruptly changes. His writing takes on a liturgical tone. And his descrip- tion of the wonders of creation is much like that found in the old Jewish prayers Christianized in Const. Ap. viii, I2.9-I5.18 The floridity of this liturgy is not "primitive"; but the church of Antioch in I8o was not primitive either. An anaphora including '1 For the Stoics, M.

Brightman (JTS 30 [1928-291, 395) would be due to borrowing by Theophilus.</page><page sequence="6">232 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW a fairly lengthy preface seems to have been known to Justin.'9 Theophilus undoubtedly rewrites the preface which he would em- ploy in the Eucharist; but it must have been much like what we find in Ad Autolycum I 6, containing passing allusions to the cos- mological chapters of Job and to the Psalms. The next chapter combines thoughts of God as creator and of God as physician, who will "raise your flesh immortal with your soul." At that time "made immortal, you will see the Immortal." This is perhaps an interpretation of I John iii.3, "We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is," in the light of I Corinthians xv.53f., according to which we shall "put on immortality." In I 8 Theophilus insists on the necessity of faith. Here he is not far from the New Testament. At this point faith to him does not mean rational inference from analogies, but confidence. Faith in the latter sense is needed by farmers, sailors, sick men, and students, who trust respectively the earth, the boat and cap- tain, the doctor, and the teacher.20 Theophilus claims that one ought to trust God, for he made each man out of nothing (a man has no existence before that of his father and mother) and formed him out of a tiny seed, which itself once did not exist. Since the seed was not really created out of nothing, the oddness of this argument is obvious. Theophilus endeavors to prop it up by men- tioning his opponent's belief in miracles worked by gods who are merely statues. But his conclusion - belief in resurrection - is hardly convincing. Perhaps for this reason Theophilus turns aside to attack the gods as deified dead men. A resounding list of false gods, false because vulnerable, was becoming a tradition of Christian apol- ogetic. It could lead to the conclusion (I io) that these are not gods, but "images, the works of men's hands" (Ps. cxiii.4, cxxxiv. 15) and "unclean demons" (Ps. xcvi.5). The perennial question of emperor-worship is briefly discussed, and the usual answer, that he deserves "legitimate honor," is given (I ii). A brief transitional chapter (I 12) seems awkwardly placed. The subject looks back to the beginning of the apology, and might "s Dial. 41 (p. 138 Otto); cf. I Clement xix-xx, and G. Bardy, "Expressions stoi- ciennes dans la ia Clementis," Rech. de science rel. 13 (1922), 73ff- 0 Otto (ad loc.) observes that this is a common patristic argument.</page><page sequence="7">THEOPHILUS OF ANTIOCH TO AUTOLYCUS 233 well have been discussed there. The name "Christian" is not absurd, but very suitable because of six parallels. (Theophilus does not mention the name of Christ.) The improvement result- ing from the use of chrism is evident in the case of ships, towers, houses, human beings, and statues. It is perhaps less evident that air and earth are "anointed" by light and spirit. And Theophilus concludes with an invitation to Autolycus to become anointed with the oil of God. Finally we are able, thus prepared, to discuss the question of resurrection (I 13). "Show me even one man raised from the dead, so that seeing I may believe," says Autolycus. Unlike Quadratus, the earliest apologist, or even Irenaeus,21 Theophilus is unable to bring forth any examples. He contents himself with three somewhat inconsistent preliminary rebuttals. Faith is of no value where there is evidence;22 moreover you accept the "resur- rections" of Heracles and Asclepius; finally you would probably not accept the evidence if I did provide it. Nevertheless - and here we come to the apologetic argument - God has provided many analogous examples. Theophilus, following the apologetic tradition,23 sets forth four of them. There are "resurrections" of seasons, days and nights; of seeds and fruits, of the moon (monthly); and of the invalid who first loses weight and then regains it. Theophilus sees that the last example may be almost too natural, for the regained weight is due to foods; but he ex- presses belief that the work of restoration is God's. An example of his rationalistic tendency may be seen in the dis- cussion of seeds. They sometimes are swallowed by a sparrow or some other bird, then eliminated in deserted places, where they grow into trees. In I Clement xxiv-xxv seasons and seeds are fol- lowed by the example of the phoenix, from the corruption of whose flesh "there springs a worm" which turns into another phoenix. Does Theophilus, sceptical of the existence of the phoenix, alter the content of the story? 2Quadratus in Eusebius, HE iv. 3. 2; Irenaeus, Adv. haer. ii. 32. 4. * Probably Theophilus is working over John xx. 29; in I 14 he paraphrases John xx. 27. ~ I Corinthians xv, I Clement xxiv-xxv, Justin, Apol. i. 19, etc. See P.

The lack of intellectual rigor in this brief apology is evident. Theophilus' stress on arguments for the excellence of the name "Christian" reveals his wounded self-esteem; but hardly impresses the reader favorably. Where he adds his own contributions to the apologetic tradition we find them unconvincing (pomegranate- seed, sparrow, sick man). He cannot finally distinguish between Christian and philosophical "faith"; he would agree with Aris- totle that "faith is a sort of demonstration." 24 Unfortunately Theophilus' demonstrations do not demonstrate. Perhaps aware of his unconvincingness as a philosopher, in his later works he lays greater stress on revelation. III. COMMENTARY ON GENESIS; CHRISTIAN ETHICS Most of the second book to Autolycus is concerned with the book of Genesis and its proper interpretation. In imperial times an interest in cosmogony was widespread,25 and the book of Genesis was much admired and criticized.26 Christians wrote com- mentaries on the hexaemeron,27 sometimes highly speculative.28 One of the most rationalistic, that of Hermogenes, was attacked not only by Tertullian 29 but even by Theophilus himself. Accord- ing to Eusebius 30 the three books to Autolycus were different from the one against the heresy of Hermogenes, in which testi- monies from the Apocalypse of John were used. But the com- mentary in Book II to Autolycus may well have provided The- ' Rhet. i. i. ii, p. 1355a; cf. R. E.

Apoc. xii.9). In any event, the relation between Ad Autolycum II and Adversus Hermogenem must have been close. The chapters (9-33) of exegesis of Genesis contain the passages of Theophilus most frequently cited by later writers, and they reveal him as the forerunner of the later Antiochene school of scriptural interpretation.3' In them, as in the work of the later Antiochenes, there is a strong note of literalism and a clear re- liance on Jewish exegesis. Man begins from a foundation when he starts to build, but God's greater power is shown in his beginning not only ex nihilo but from above; for the heaven was made first in place of the roof.32 Then came earth (the soil and foundation), abyss (the multitude of waters), darkness (caused by the heaven which God made, severing the waters and the earth like a lid), spirit borne above the waters (animating the creation, like the soul in man). This spirit is subtle and the water is subtle, so that the spirit nourishes the water and both of them, penetrating every- where, nourish creation. The spirit had held the place 33 of light between the water and the heaven so that the darkness might not touch the heaven, which was nearer God.34 The heaven was like a dome-shaped covering over lump-like matter. Then the com- mand (Logos) of God shone like a lamp and illuminated this room-like region under heaven. (Moreover it was God who gave the names to created things, not man.) This heaven is invisible to us; the heaven we see is called "firmament," and half the water was taken up into it for rains, showers, and dews. The remaining half was left on earth for rivers, fountains, and seas. At first it 1 On the text and canon of Theophilus see my article in JBL 66 (i947) For the school of Antioch see L.

Then God formed it and adorned it with herbs, seeds and plants (II 13). On the fourth day the luminaries were made, after plants and seeds. This order was intended to refute the opinions of philosophers who say that things growing on the earth are produced from the heav- enly bodies. What is posterior cannot produce what is prior. These luminaries also contain the pattern and type of a great mys- tery: the sun is a type of God (surpassing moon in power and glory, remaining ever full and perfect) while the moon is a type of man (waning monthly, "dying," rising again). So the three days before the luminaries are types of the triad, God, Logos, Sophia. The fourth day is the type of man, who needs light. Moreover the arrangement of the stars is typical: the bright fixed stars are in imitation of the prophets; the less bright are righteous men; and wandering planets are a type of the men who have wan- dered from God and abandoned his law and commandments (II 15). The fifth day saw the production of the creatures which came out of the waters. God blessed them in order to show the future blessing of baptism. Carnivorous animals are types of robbers and murderers and godless persons, but in general the fish and reptiles "received no specially distinctive property" (II 16). On the sixth day God did not bless the animals he made but reserved his blessing for man. Quadrupeds are a type of men who mind earthly things, while birds are a type of those who fly upward in spirit. There are also birds which do not fly; these are sinful men. Wild beasts (0hplia) are so-called from their being hunted (6qPEdVEo-OaL) - for everything was originally good, but when man, the master of the house, sinned, the slaves naturally, sinned too. Therefore when man comes back to his original, nat- ural condition, the animals will once more be gentle (II 17). Finally, man, the only work created by God's hands, Logos and Sophia, came into existence (II 18). "Man became a living soul"; therefore by most persons the soul is called immortal. And God placed him in the eastern regions, "excellent for light, brilliant with a very bright atmosphere, possessing the finest plants" (II I9).</page><page sequence="11">THEOPHILUS OF ANTIOCH TO AUTOLYCUS 237 For his exegesis Theophilus generally turns back to his Jewish or Jewish-Christian teachers. Almost everything in his exegesis can be paralleled in Jewish haggadic literature. His two heavens, the one in- visible, the other visible, are found in the Septuagint reading of Genesis i.i, especially as interpreted by Philo, or in Deuteronomy x. 14 ("the heaven, and the heaven of heavens"), as interpreted by some of the Tannaite rabbis of the second century. The idea that God unlike man begins building from above is somewhat like the story in Bereshith Rabbah i.I3: "The rabbis said, Mortal man builds an edifice, and if he succeeds according to his intentions he can widen it as the building rises; but if not, he must broaden it below and narrow it at the top. The Holy One, blessed be he, is not so, however." Indeed, one of the many points on which the first-century schools of Shammai and Hillel disagreed was that of the order of creation; the school of Shammai, like Theophilus, maintained that heaven came first.35 "It is like a king who first made his throne and then his footstool, for it is written, 'The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool' (Isaiah lxvi.i)." The division of the waters into equal parts is also rabbinic.36 And the idea that the waters were put half in the firmament and half on earth is paral- leled in BR iv.4: "R. Johanan said, The Holy One, blessed be he, took all the primeval water and poured half in the firmament and half into the ocean." The collection of the waters was made by the Logos; in BR v.4 we read, "R. Levi said, Some interpreters, e.g. the Son of 'Azzai and the son of Zoma, interpret: The voice of the Lord became a guide to the waters, as it is written, 'The voice of the Lord is over the waters' (Ps. xxix.3)." Theophilus' idea that the creation of the sun and the moon on the fourth day refutes philosophers is not quite paralleled by a Jewish view:37 "R. 'Azariah said in R. Manian's name, The orb of the sun alone was created to give light; yet if so, why was the moon created? Because the Holy One, blessed be he, foresaw that the peoples of the world would treat them as divinities. Said the Lord, If they are two, opposed to each other, and yet the peoples of the world treat them as divinities, how much more would they do so if there were but one!" The restoration to gentleness of wild animals is to be found in the prophetic writings (Isaiah 1xv.25). Finally, man as the only work of both God's hands is found in the later than second-century Abot de-R. Nathan:38 "How do we know that Adam was made by the two hands of God? Because it says, 'Thy hands have formed me' (Ps. cxix.73)." The "most ' BR i. 15; cf. L. Ginzberg, Die Haggada bei den Kirchenviitern (Berlin, 19oo). 6 BR iv. 5. 87BR vi. I. ' Abot de-R.

For he was made on the sixth day but formed only after paradise was made, after the seventh day (II 23). There were two trees in paradise which were unlike any others on earth - and paradise was on earth (not in one of the heavens). Three of the four rivers flowing out of Eden can be identified; Geon is the Nile, and certainly we know the Tigris and Euphrates, which lie at our borders (II 24). Man's duties in the garden were to keep the divine commandments. But Adam disobeyed. Though the tree of knowledge and its fruit were good, not deadly as some think,40 his transgression brought death. Adam was still an infant, unable to receive knowledge rightly. God was not grudging to him, as some think; 41 God wanted to test him, to see if he would obey his commandment. Moreover he wanted man to remain simple and sincere, in infancy; and it is right for children to obey their parents, and not to know too much for their age. We grow in knowledge as in years. And when a law requires abstinence from something, the law is not the cause of punishment, but disobedience and transgression. For this cause Adam was ejected from paradise (II 25). But God was a great benefactor to man in his keeping him from being for- ever in sin. Therefore he punished him so that at some future time he might return to paradise. This is why in Genesis the story seems to show man placed twice in paradise: the first time was when he was placed there; the second will be fulfilled after fhe resurrection and judgment. Just as a defective potter's vessel is remoulded and made new and whole, so it happens to man in death. He is broken up so that at the resurrection he may be found healthy, i.e. spotless and just and immortal. God's ques- tion, "Where art thou, Adam?" (Genesis iii.9) is not really a question but a call to repentance and confession (II 26). Is man SCompare Wisdom viii. 19f., ix. 15. 40 Doubtless Marcionites; cf.

No, he was made neither mortal nor immortal by nature. For if God had made him immortal from the beginning, he would have made him God; and if mortal, God would seem to be the cause of his death. God made him capable of either death or immortality; had he kept the com- mandment he would have been immortal. For God made him free and self-controlled. Though man acquired death for himself by his neglect and disobedience, God in his philanthropy and mercy gives him eternal life if he will obey the law and holy command- ments which God gave us. He who keeps them can be saved and at the resurrection can inherit incorruption (II 27). After Adam was driven out of paradise he knew his wife Eve (Genesis iv.I). God made her from his rib, not because he could not form her separately, but because he knew that a multitude of gods were going to be introduced by men through the deceit of the serpent. For though God is one, even at that time deceit was undertaking to spread secretly a multitude of gods and to say, "Ye shall be as gods" (Genesis iii.5). In order to refute this idea God did not make man and woman separately. In fact the creation of the two of them, in order that there might be greater benevolence between them, demonstrates the mystery of the sole rule of God. Adam prophesied that man would leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife, which is actually the case. Eve was so called because she was deceived by the serpent and became the origin of sin; the evil demon who spoke through the serpent, and still works in men possessed by him, is also called Satan, demon and (from diroSEpaKE'vaL; he fled from God) dragon; he was originally an angel (II 28). These six chapters describing the fall of man, like those interpreting the story of creation, are largely derived from Jewish sources. The tree of knowledge puzzled the rabbis; some said its fruit was wheat, others grapes. "R. 'Azariah and R. Judah b. R. Simon in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi said, Heaven forfend (that we should conjecture what the tree was): The Holy One, blessed be he, did not and will not reveal to man what that tree was." 42 Philo, on the contrary, takes the tree as an occasion for allegorization: "This description is, I think, intended sym- bolically rather than literally, for never yet have trees of life or of under- " BR xv. 7.</page><page sequence="14">240 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW standing appeared on earth, nor is it likely that they will appear here- after." 4 Man's duty in the garden was to study and keep the Law.44 The idea of Adam as an infant is implied in BR xxii.2: "R. Huma and R. Jacob in R. Abba's name said, No creature ever copulated before Adam; it is not written, man knew, but And the man; Knew intimates that he made known sexual functions to all." So Clement of Alexandria explains that before the fall Adam and Eve had no intercourse because they were children; their sin consisted in their premature marriage.45 This view, which to some extent was shared by Irenaeus and other fathers, was rejected by Augustine, and is not now considered orthodox.46 Not all the third century rabbis agreed that Adam was an infant: "R. Judah b. R. Simon said, Eve too was created fully developed. R. Johanan said, Adam and Eve were created as at the age of twenty." 47 Adam's return to paradise and God's goodness toward him were mat- ters for discussion in the late second century: "R. Judah and R. Nehe- miah differ. R. Judah said, He was sent forth from the garden of Eden in this world and the next. R. Nehemiah maintained, He was sent forth from the garden of Eden in this world, but not in the next. In R. Judah's view he laid a severe punishment upon him, while in that of R. Nehemiah he was lenient toward him. ... When he created him, he created him by his attributes of justice and mercy, and when he banished him, he likewise banished him in accordance with his attributes of justice and mercy." 48 The closest parallel to Theophilus' idea of God as potter is to be found in Sirach xxxviii.29f., but it was common.49 God knew where Adam was, but he wanted him to consider what he was. Accord- ing to Philo, God uttered not a question but "rather a threat and a conviction." 50 "Neither mortal nor immortal" is a Hebrew idea, accord- ing to Nemesius, bishop of Emesa in Syria in the fourth century, though some Jews thought of Adam as created immortal.51 Man's free will is stressed in a fourth-century interpretation: "R.

Not all Theophilus' information about the past comes from the "prophets" of the Old Testament. Some of it is confirmed by the Sibylline Oracles, from which he gives three quotations (II 3,31, 36).56 The Sibyl herself, unlike Greek poets and philosophers, was inspired by God in the same way as the prophets (II 9). Theophilus can even speak of "The Sibyl and the rest of the prophets" (II 38). Presumably Theophilus writes his interpretation of Genesis in opposition to more speculative interpreters, even though he does not mention them. His preliminary refutation of the schools (114) includes an attack on Stoicism and Platonism which might well be aimed also at Hermogenes." Perhaps relying on Hermas 58 he declares that the primary teaching of the inspired prophets is crea- tion out of nothing, for there is not anything contemporaneous with God (II io). Hermogenes denied this.59 But in the exegesis proper Theophilus refrains from debate. His interpretation is addressed primarily to outsiders, who need not know anything about heresies except that they are like rockbound islands (II 14). The teachers of truth and the lovers of truth (II 14, cf. I i) are to be found in churches. Theophilus often tries to give a systematic, orderly picture of Christian thought.

In a later chapter (II 38) he presents passages of the Old Testament bearing on the destruction of the world by fire and on providence. This col- lection of quotations leads directly to further poetical verses which are derived from an anthology used constantly by Theophilus.60 From this anthology he borrowed the idea of arranging verses topically, although Justin had already done the same thing."' The second book to Autolycus is Theophilus' most sustained effort at writing theology. Like his apology (Book I), it is not altogether successful. Compared with the writings of Justin, of Melito of Sardis, even of Athenagoras, of Irenaeus, we feel that something is lacking. That something seems to be a firm grasp on the apostolic tradition. Apologetic convention is probably respon- sible for his failure even to mention the name of Jesus, for Tatian is similarly reticent. But just here we might have expected a suc- cessor of Ignatius to escape from convention into religious reality. IV. ETHICS AND CHRONOLOGY Some characteristic writing of Theophilus is to be found in his last book to Autolycus. Here he combines apologetic arguments with not too intelligent use of a few sources, but produces results which on his own grounds are fairly satisfactory. Three topics are discussed: the folly of Greek philosophy and religion (1-8), the ethical quality of Christian teaching (9-15), and the antiquity of the biblical revelation (16-30). His principal source for the opinions of philosophers is a doxo- graphical work, a list of philosophers' opinions arranged by sub- jects. Unfortunately Theophilus is not content to copy this source; he feels that he must improve it. For example, to a list of those who recommend incestuous marriages he adds the name of Epi- curus: "And Epicurus himself, along with his teaching atheism, advised intercourse with mothers and sisters, even in spite of the laws which forbid this" (III 6). As Diogenes Laertius x. i8 makes clear, Epicurus' view was precisely the opposite. fn dis- "H. Diels in Rhein. Mus. 30 (1875), 177; A.

This analysis is hardly correct. And Theophilus' denunciation of Greek religion is only slightly more interesting. His discussion of Christian morality is more intelligent. In addition to his analysis of the Decalogue 62 he makes an effort to systematize Christian ethics. His model is the poetic anthology he so often employs. In chapters 11-14 he provides a discussion of four main headings of the law, thus anticipating the later Chris- tian theory of the cardinal virtues.63 HEADING BIBLICAL VERSE plcrvola - Isaiah lv.6-7 Ezekiel xviii.21-23 Isaiah xxxi.6 and xlv.22 Jeremiah vi.9 8tKatoovy - Isaiah i.i 6-i 7 Isaiah lviii.6-8 Jeremiah vi.I6 (also Ps.-Jerem.?)

Doubtless from such lectures Theophilus acquired not only his fourfold division of virtues but most of the texts to illustrate them. It is interesting to observe, however, that the last two virtues are illustrated by texts from both testaments. Such "syntheses" were produced in opposition to the Antitheses of Marcion in the latter half of the second century; they are in- tended to show the agreement of the Old Testament with the New. Such a collection is to be found in the lectures of the anonymous presbyter written down from memory by Irenaeus.67 The four virtues themselves are "apologetic" in character; LEr1dvota is sub- stituted for 4pdVpvO-, Eo-ELv0q (UE'XpL 9vvo'laq) for a-coopoo-Yv), and OtXavOpcoria for aiv8pEta. Thus the De Virtutibus of Philo is divided under the headings rEpt vaPEta, iTEP, 'LtPavOpcorial, rTEL E'ravo as and -p Ev,~ev~elas, and may originally have included a section TrEpL EVo-EJ6L'a.68 ALKaLOorvvy had been included in the De Specialibus Legibus 136-238, as Philo himself says.69 I have discussed elsewhere the biblical and post-biblical chron- ology of Theophilus.70 In it he makes use of three sources: the Bible, Josephus, and Chryseros the Nomenclator. To suspect him, as Werner does,"71 of the intention to provide an eschatological scheme, is over-subtle. It is just because he was unaware of the eschatological implications of a world-chronology that his work became useless for his successors. In conclusion, we may say that the third book to Autolycus is characterized by much of the same ineptness that we find in the other two. Why must Theophilus make mistakes in attacking philosophers? Why must he give the Decalogue without some of the commandments and with some "judgments" from Exodus xxiii? Why is Book III partly repeti- tion of Book I and why does it discuss two very loosely related subjects, Christian morality and the antiquity of Israel? The an- swers to some of these questions probably lie in the environment at Antioch; others find their solution in the man himself. Brought 67 Irenaeus, Adv. haer. iv. 32. I (II, 254). 8s E. R.

Of his successor Maxi- mus nothing is known. But the next bishop of Antioch, Serapion, had to write a book to Domnus, "who had fallen away from the faith of Christ at the time of the persecution to Jewish supersti- tion." 72 It is tempting to find in Domnus a follower of Theoph- ilus. V. THEOLOGY The theological outlook of Theophilus is strikingly like that of Paul of Samosata, whom Bardy describes as follows: "Theologien d'occasion, le Samosateen s'efforgait beaucoup plftot de r conciler, sur le terrain de monothbisme, les croyances juives et paiennes avec 11'vangile que de penetrer la richesse de la foi catholique." 73 We have already briefly considered Theophilus' discussion of the attributes of God and of God as creator; let us turn to his teach- ing concerning the "hands" of God - Logos and Sophia. A. LOGOs Though God himself is known through his works (I 4,5, II,io) and through the prophets inspired by him (II 9, III 17), Theoph- ilus regards these activities of revelation as performed not directly by God himself, the one without beginning, changeless, immortal (I 4), but by his "hands" or powers, Logos and Sophia. The chief interest to us in Theophilus' doctrine of the Logos is his distinction between the Logos E'l'"OcErog and the Logos TrrpoboptK6`, apparently first made in the third century B.C. by the Stoic Chrysippus. In Stoic and other philosophical thought after his time Logos as a psychological term meant both reason and voice or word. Within man it was reason, and expressed rea- son became voice or word. Logicians made a distinction between courses of study intended to train the mind and those to train the voice. Sextus Empiricus, following Chrysippus, says that man 72 Eusebius, HE vi. 12. 1. " G.

Also following Chrysippus, a scholion on the Theogony of Hesiod identifies Iris with the urpoboptKO' X69oY since epco is the same as Eyco. And Galen says that "the philosophers" distinguish between the two logoi. The distinction is also to be found in Plutarch, as well as in the alle- gorists Cornutus and Heraclitus 7" who identify Hermes with the power of speech. In Philo there are many references to this dis- tinction: for example, in the Vita Mosis ii.i29 he states that there are two logoi for each of us, the .Tpo opCLK6 and the E'vaLE7roa. The former serves for explanation, the latter for truth. God too has a Logos, but Philo avoids dividing it as he does its human counterpart.75 In the early Christian apologists this distinction is transferred to the divine Logos. Justin 76 compares the generation of the Logos to our human experience. When we express some logos (thought) we beget a logos (word); but it is not diminished in the process. Tatian 7 draws a similar parallel. And Athena- goras 78 says that the Logos was the first-begotten of the Father, but not as a creature, for from the beginning God, being eternal Nous, had the Logos (reason) in himself, for he is eternally rea- sonable. Here the distinction between iYvCWEroS and 7rpo optK6s is at least implicit, and as Geffcken 79 points out, the expression "first-begotten" is taken from Justin, while the general idea seems to be Philonic. Such speculation was current to such an extent that Irenaeus devotes considerable space to rejecting these an- thropomorphisms.80 God's thoughts are not like those of men. While his condemnation is directed against the Valentinians it probably includes the speculations of the apologists as well. Simi- larly Clement 81 remarks that "we maintain that the essential Logos is God in God, who is also said to be 'in the bosom of the 7 SVF II 223, 137, 135; Plutarch, De Iside 7; Cornutus, Theol. gr. 16; Heracli- tus, Quaest. homer. 72. 5 Spec. leg. iv. 69, Mos. ii. 127-29; J.

The expression "essen- tial" is an attempt by Clement to avoid the term i'vEdceroa. This distinction is made by Theophilus in II Io, "God having his own Logos Ev&amp;a"Oeroa in his own bowels begot him with his own Sophia,82 bringing him forth before everything," and in II 22, where the voice which Adam heard in Eden was the Logos, God's son. Originally the Logos was always Ev&amp;dlEOroa in the heart of God; it was his counsellor, mind and understanding (Pp6irqo-ut). "When God desired to make what he wished, he begot this Logos VrpogboptK69, the firstborn of all creation,83 not emptying himself of Logos (reason), but begetting Logos (a word) and conversing with his Logos continually" (II 22). Then follows a quotation from the first chapter of the Fourth Gospel; but clearly the em- phasis is laid on the phraseology of Stoic psychology. The am- biguity of the Logos Christology comes from the ambiguity of the Greek word, and the decline of the doctrine was due to this confusion. Theophilus, in formulating his Logos doctrine, is primarily interpreting the words of scripture, though in terms derived from Stoic-Philonic psychology. Few of the functions of the Logos are assigned to the Logos vLcdWEeroa. Like reason in man it is situated in God's bowels (II io) or heart (II 22). This idea is derived from the primitive psychology of the Old Testament.84 It is al- ways with him (II 10,22); it is his counsellor, mind, understand- ing (o-4L povXos, voiVi, fpOv77o-t II 22). It is the dpx-4 in which God made heaven and earth (II I3). This interpretation of Genesis i.i and Proverbs vii.22 apparently begins in Colossians i.i6-i8,85 and is very common in early Christianity; ordinarily the "beginning" is referred to the Logos as Son.86 In Theophilus' 'On such triads see H.

Before its generation or utter- ance by the Father, the Logos was not a person distinct from him. It was essentially one of his attributes (I 3). When God desired to create the world, however, he generated or uttered the Logos, which then became 7rpod0optKok. The process was not effected all at once, however, for God brought the Logos (and Sophia) into being before everything else (II io). Through the Logos he created the world. At this point the fundamental am- biguity of the term Logos becomes evident, for the Logos is no longer merely God's reason - though it always remains to con- verse with him (II 22) - but also his command (8trat4 II 13) and voice (4o~wv II 22). Clearly here Theophilus is interpreting the prologue to the Fourth Gospel, where at the beginning was the Logos and the Logos was 7rpo' , v OEOv and the Logos was the true light. And this prologue itself is an interpretation of Genesis i.i-i3; the Logos, as Theophilus says, is the command of God, shining like a lamp in an enclosed room, lighting the regions under heaven (II 13). By his Logos God brought together the water into one place (II 13). The three timeless days before the lumi- naries were made are types of God and his Logos and his Sophia (II 15). In fact God made everything by his Logos; but he con- sidered everything as by-products; the only eternal " work of his hands was man. Yet he did not ss say, "Let us make man according to image and according to likeness" as if he needed assistance; for he said "Let us make" to none other than his own Logos and his own Sophia (II 18). The stress on "his own" makes it likely that Theophilus did not regard Logos and Sophia as helpers but as instruments of God's own will. The idea that God used instruments in creation is taken over from Platonism, where the instruments are really collaborators, by Greek-speaking Jews who wanted to explain away the anthropomorphic "hands" of God in the Old Testament.89 When this interpretation of 7 Reading dta8to with manuscripts against iLiw, of Gesner, approved by Loofs, op. cit., 68, and L.

In Palestinian Judaism the doctrine of "two powers" was con- demned by the rabbis,90 and the teachers of Trypho interpreted this verse as addressed by God either to himself or to the elements from which man was to be made." Other teachers explained it as God's giving an example to man by asking advice of the angels.92 The work of the Logos was not finished when it had played its part in the creation of man, for it was not God whom Adam heard or who walked in the garden of Eden, but the Logos in the person of God (E'v~rpoo-rJnrc). "Since the Logos is divine (Eo's) and be- gotten of God, whenever the Father of All wishes he sends it to some place; when it arrives it is heard and seen --having been sent by him - and thus is found in once place" (II 22). Thus are explained the theophanies of the Old Testament; it was not the Father of All who appeared to men, but his Logos, in his form. Moreover the Logos inspired Moses, Solomon, and the prophets (II Io). The Logos came down on them93 and through them spoke forth the details of creation and everything else (II io). The Logos 7TpoOopW,'49 or xovij is also the EayyEXLo fOvT) (III I3). And therefore we may conclude that in II 22 among the appearances of the Logos is included that in Christ --whose name Theophilus never mentions. Such an appearance need not be an incarnation. As in the case of Moses (II io) the Divine Logos could have spoken through Christ as through an instrument. But if it could appear in the person (Trpoo-oarov) of God, it could probably appear in the flesh; it could become flesh, as Justin 94 explicitly teaches. Though it is the Logos, not Christ, to whom Theophilus refers as the Son of God, his definitions are taken from the books of the New Testament, and he certainly knew the Fourth Gospel. Although he explains the Logos in Stoic terms, it comes to him from the Gospel of John. * G. F.

Before the creation it was, like the Logos, within God (II 9,10); God begot it with the Logos before everything else. The function of Sophia was the ordering of the invisible heaven and the chaos which God had created by his Logos (I 7, II 33), for "God by Sophia founded the earth." 91 This "manifold Sophia of God" " gave names to all the component parts of the world. It prepared the parables of nature as proofs of the resurrection (I 13). It inspired the prophets (II 9), and it now purifies men's hearts and heals the eyes of their spirits (I 7). Here as elsewhere Theophilus is reworking and interpreting Biblical materials. The idea of Sophia as a power separate from God is expressed in Proverbs vii.i-3 1, Sirach xxiv.I-2 2, and Wis- dom of Solomon vii.22ff. In the New Testament of Theophilus, Christ is represented as Sophia in Matthew xi.28-3o, a passage apparently based on Sirach li.33-34. In the Pauline epistles Christ is the Sophia of God (I Cor. i.24; Col. i.I5-18); as Leisegang 9' suggests, the middle term by which Christ is equated with Sophia is rTvEV^Pa, for Christ is irvEvpa in II Cor. iii.7. In Luke xi.49 Sophia is represented as speaking about the deaths of the proph- ets; it is not clear whether it is identified with Christ or not. In the Fourth Gospel, as Leisegang remarks,98 the Logos takes over all the functions which Sophia and irvEiLca had in Paul. Theophilus was compelled to synthesize these divergent ele- ments. While Philo has similar difficulties in equating Sophia and Logos and in keeping them distinct, Theophilus is rewriting not Philo but the New Testament. He is probably influenced by Wis- dom ix.i-2, where God makes all things by his Logos and by (iv) his Sophia forms man. While this originally meant simply "with reason and in wisdom," a literal-minded theologian could interpret it more precisely. According to Rendel Harris 99 Theophilus reached his theory " Proverbs iii. 7, quoted in I 7. 96 Ephesians iii. Io, quoted in I 6. 7 H. Leisegang, "Sophia," RE III A 1o34. 9 Ibid., 1035. 9 J. R.

It might better be said that in reading the prophets of the Old Testament, especially Solomon, Theophilus found Sophia playing the r81e which, when he read the works of the inspired John, he found ascribed to Logos. In the two pas- sages in which his logos-doctrine is most clearly presented (II 10,22) he is careful to state that Logos and Sophia are the same. C. SPIRIT To Theophilus "Spirit" has two meanings. In the first place it is the breath of God, which we ourselves breathe (I 7); it sustains the world and surrounds everything (I 5), like the anima mundi of the Stoics.100 But the idea is essentially derived from the Bible; if God held his breath the world would perish.'0' This spirit is life-giving: at the creation it was borne over the waters so that it could nourish water and then with water nourish the whole creation; it could mingle with water because both water and spirit are fine or subtle elements (II 13). Before light came into exist- ence, spirit between heaven and water kept darkness from touch- ing God (II I3). After light shone forth, spirit with it "anointed" the air and everything under the heaven (I 12). In the second place it is a medium of revelation, though not quite a personal agent like Logos or Sophia, both of whom are identified with it (II Io, I 7). "We Christians are taught by a holy spirit which spoke in the holy prophets and foretold every- thing" (II 33). This spirit gave the prophets the wisdom which is from God (II 9). The prophets are irvEvparok6pot. They be- came musical instruments of God (II 9, io); this is a Stoic- Philonic idea.102 Spirit is not primarily a person or hypostasis; it is the life- giving breath of God (I 3), or, as the Stoics were accustomed to define it, a wind.103 This idea is also characteristic of biblical 1 Wisdom i. 9; Aetius, Plac. i. 6. i = H.

Theophilus' idea of the subtlety of spirit doubtless comes from Wisdom vii.22-23, where it is stressed as one of the attributes of the spirit that is, or is in, Sophia. 04 He often identifies spirit with Sophia. In I 7 he shows that God made everything through his Logos and Sophia, for by his Logos the heavens were established and by his spirit all their might" (Psalm xxxii.6). In I 13 he refers to I Corinthians xii.ii, "All these worketh the one and the same spirit," in the words, "All these worketh the Sophia of God." But the identification is not systematic or thoroughgoing. As Puech suggests,'0' Theophilus may prefer to work with the con- cept of Sophia as the third member of his triad rather than with that of Spirit because of the confusion involved in the latter term. But the triad is so fluid, since as Theophilus himself says (II io) Logos is Spirit of God and Beginning and Sophia and Power of the Highest, that we cannot be certain. Behind all his definitions lie the Christologies of the New Testa- ment. It is Christ who is the Logos,106 who is the Spirit,107 who is the Beginning,10s or in the Beginning,109 and who is the Sophia of God and the Power of God.110 In his doctrine of God and of what was to be known as the Trinity, Theophilus is not guided by the tradition of the church as was, for example, Irenaeus. He was an individual interpreter of the inspired writings. D. ESCHATOLOGY Last of all we may consider Theophilus' interpretation of the final fate of man and the world. As in so many other instances, at this point Theophilus tries to combine Hebrew and Greek ideas. Following the Old Testament he says that man will be raised by God (I 7,8). In the resurrection is included every man (I i3), even those who are dead (II 38). On the other hand, man can in his lifetime become a god: yvqrat OE's (II 27, compare II 24).

The idea of immortality (c0avacria) is rare in Christian literature until we reach the apologists; originally it was simply regarded as a gift from God to man. But in Hellenistic thought, as A. J. Festu- gi"re i remarks, "L'dOavaoria suppose une EOvTro-OvL. Pour de- venir immortel, il faut 8tre dieu. Car l'immortalit6, au sens plein, est un privilbge strictement divin." He cites 112 the words of Hippolytus in On the Theophany: El dc0dva'rol, EooraL Ka lOEOF. Even to Philo such a statement would have seemed difficult. "One must become God - which is impossible - in order to compre- hend God." 113 In regard to the fate of the world Theophilus stresses the EKIrpwocrYv, a phrase he takes from the Stoics along with much of its content. The destruction of the world by fire is not portrayed in the Old Testament. The fire in Malachi iii.19 and Isaiah xxx.28, 30, which Theophilus quotes, works only the destruction of the wicked, as does the "lake of fire" in Apoc. xix.20. But in the middle of the second century II Peter iii.io states that at the day of the Lord "the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are therein shall be burned up." Apparently, however, Christians are to escape the "cosmic bonfire" in some way, and they "look for new heavens and a new earth" (II Peter iii.i3). Very similar and perhaps derived from the epistle is the view of Theophilus, though he expresses it in Stoic terms as EK1TVprcYL and dirooKardo-rao-L. Justin had been aware of the simi- larity of Christian and Stoic teaching on this subject: according to him the Sibyl and Hystaspes had predicted the destruction by fire of all corruptible things, and the Stoics taught that God himself would be resolved into fire; yet Justin had rejected this view, for God is the creator, not the creation."'4 But while the Stoic i'm1p0oX7L and diroKardrao-otL were to be recurrent phenom- ena,11, in the opinion of Theophilus and other Christians they ' L'ideal religieux des grecs et 1'6vangile (ed. 2, Paris, 1932), 39; cf.

For the wicked there waits an eternal fire (I 14). In The- ophilus' mind, as in the Bible, it is not quite clear whether the renewal is to be on this earth, as paradise was (II 24), or in heaven. VI. CONCLUSION In his theological system Theophilus depends almost entirely on the Greek Old Testament and on the books which were coming to be regarded as the New Testament. In his interpretation of the Old Testament he relied on his Jewish teachers; Judaism was flourishing in Antioch at the end of the second century, and in several areas Christians and Jews were closely related. For the New Testament he relies on his own synthesis; while he knows the apology of Justin he makes almost no use of it. His doctrine of God, while essentially based on scripture, is so greatly influ- enced by Stoic and Hellenistic Jewish concepts that when he de- clares that God is angry at sinners the anthropomorphic expression is surprising. In his doctrine of the Logos he attempts to apply to the Logos of the Fourth Gospel the distinction of Stoic and Philonic psychology between the Xo'yo'; vE'V &amp;81ro and the X6yos Vrpo opLK6o . In the Old Testament, especially the Wisdom of Solomon, and in some early Christian writings he found another hypostasis, the Sophia of God. He endeavors to explain Sophia as one of the two "hands" of God, the other being Logos; but since in Christianity the concept of Logos is fundamentally a de- velopment out of that of Sophia, and since in the New Testament they are both based on the person of Christ, this distinction was not destined to survive. Theophilus himself says that they are identical. His doctrine of Spirit is also based on the Old Testa- ment, but since Sophia has taken its place in his rptdsg, it becomes vague and contradictory. The most important part of scripture to Theophilus was the cosmogony in Genesis. In his time a lively interest was taken in ancient oriental cosmogonies, and he sets forth the true one in his second book to Autolycus. His exegesis is sober and ordi-</page><page sequence="29">THEOPHILUS OF ANTIOCH TO AUTOLYCUS 255 narily literal, though he finds ethical meanings in the various kinds of animals which God made on the several days of creation. Al- most every element in his exegesis can be paralleled in the hag- gadic interpretations of the rabbis. Concerning the fall of man and the early history of mankind Theophilus again follows Genesis as it was interpreted by the rabbis. His eschatology seems to be based on earlier Christian teachers, however, possibly, as for the coming lKVr6pocr-o, on II Peter. While he uses the Stoic terms, such as K- xripwot- and dVroKao-rao-tL, his teaching is grounded in a literal interpretation of the New Testament. The few scholars who in recent decades have devoted special attention to Theophilus have received strikingly divergent impres- sions of his ability. H. Gelzer,116 studying the chronographical work of Julius Africanus, mentions "den rohen chronologischen Versuch des Theophilos von Antiochien." Independent analysis confirms this judgment. His theological views have occasioned more discussion. Writing on the presentation of Christianity as monotheism in the Greek apologists, J. Lortz 117 remarks: "Am radikalsten unter den griechischen Apologeten ist in diesem Punkte Theophilus." O. Clausen 118 had earlier gone so far as to compare Theophilus' rationalism with that of Aristotle and the Stoa, and had said: "Ein 'christlicher' Charakter, - dies Praidicat ist dem Theophilus nicht vorzuenthalten." G. Bardy,119 on the other hand, denies any originality to Theophilus. Au lieu d'un systeme personnel, nous avons d'autant plus de chance de trouver chez lui le simple 6cho de l'enseignement traditionnel. Lors donc qu'il parle de la Trinite - et il est le premier auteur chez qui l'on trouve le terme de rTpta, a propos de Dieu, - ou encore lorsqu'il explique que, quand Dieu voulut faire ce dont il avait le dessein, il engendra le Verbe en le prof6rant (Trorov y T~v Xov 'cy'vvYorC 7rpobopLKYv), - et il est aussi le plus ancient &amp;crivain chretien qui applique au Verbe cette epithete de couleur stoicienne, - il ne fait rien d'extraordinaire; il emploie des mots deja courant autour de lui; il se sert des formules que tout le monde, du moins dans les &amp;coles chr6tiennes, connait a ne Sextus Julius Africanus und die byzantinische Chronographie I (Leipzig, i880), 22. 117Tertullian als Apologet II (Miinster, 1928), 5. n1 "Die Theologie des Theophilus von Antiochien," ZWT 46 (1903), 99.

Unfortunately there is no evidence for this view, or even for the existence of Christian schools at Antioch. Only one critic, F. Loofs,120 who was attempting to prove the dependence of Irenaeus on Theophilus, has become extravagant in speaking of his ability. "Als Schriftsteller wie als Theologe gr6sser war als Irenaeus." To this statement W. Bauer 121 replies: "Mir fehlt noch der Ausgleich zwischen diesem den Irenaeus iiberragenden Theologen und dem flachen Schwaitzer der Apologie an Autolykos." The severity of this condemnation is matched by a comment of V. Schultze,122 to whom it "ausgeschlossen scheint, dass ein antiochenischer Bischof eine mit soviel Torheiten und Irrtiimern gefiillte Schrift verfasst habe." It is evident that most scholars have no very high opinion of Theophilus of Antioch. And the purpose of the present study has not been to present an apology for his work. But in the course of the analysis it has perhaps become clear that some of Theophilus' aberrations are due to his methods, and that these methods are the ordinary methods of his time. Most of his difficulties, how- ever, are due to his own limitations. He was unable to understand clearly either the Christian faith or the Hellenistic philosophies opposed to it. For this reason his books to Autolycus were not influential in the history of Christian theology. Their value lies in their reflection of the beginnings of a learned theology. The- ophilus was not successful; but he was a pioneer. STheophilus von Antiochien adversus Marcionem (TU 462, 1930), 431.
