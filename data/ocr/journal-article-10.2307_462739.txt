African and African American Literature To the Editor: In his introduction to the special issue on African and African American Literature (105 [1990]: 11-22), Henry Louis Gates, Jr., has written an inspiring and optimistic analysis of our part of the profession at the end of the 1980s. However, he depicts the current situation in terms that are far too sanguine, and he lets the profession off much too easily. Having entered the field of African American literature during the first of the historical periods Gates defines, the 1960s, and continued in it to the present, I cannot suppress the thought that history is all too capable of repeating itself unless certain basic atti- tudes change. The 1960s saw a great surge of interest in what were then termed "black" authors. Several series of lost African American works appeared, many of them in in- expensive paperback editions that could be used in the classroom. Prestigious journals printed articles on African American authors for the first time. A chosen few of these authors even began to appear in nonsegregated territory for the first time-in general anthologies of American literature. But tokenism remains a serious problem to this day, and two contradictory statements in Gates's introduction call attention to one of the root causes. Gates states that there is "keen competition" for "talented job candidates" in the fields of African and Afri- can American literature (19), but he also acknowledges that he wrote forty-nine letters of recommendation for "one talented white job candidate in African literature; all forty- nine applications were unsuccessful" (12). In areas that the profession takes seriously, factors such as race, ethnicity, and gen- der are overlooked. When institutions are more interested in window dressing than in quality, those factors become nearly the sole criteria. When was the last time an institu- tion insisted on hiring a recent immigrant from England to teach courses in British lit- erature? Yet it is obvious from the experience of Gates's colleague that in our field a job announcement for a position in African literature might as well include a color chip such as one uses to pick out paint: match this or be darker and we'll be interested in talking with you. Would a department in search of a professor specializing in Victorian fiction make any such distinction? It would not. It would seek out the best qualified applicant it could find. In the African American field, however, institutions have not progressed beyond the thinking of the 1960s. A novel of that period, The Spook Who Sat by the Door (1969), by Sam Greenlee, illustrates that attitude nicely. The protagonist, Dan Freeman, is hired by the CIA, not because he will make an excellent agent, though he is well qualified, but because the agency needs a visible token black to sit by the door and be seen by visitors. Existing federal laws, now being enforced, protect us from our enemies on the right. What we must now learn to do is to protect ourselves from our friends who are slightly left of center. The white groupies who flocked into my black literature classes in the six- ties have now grown up. Many seem to be running prestigious educational institutions. 1123</page><page sequence="2">Forum But their enthusiasm is still artificial, and their influence is more negative than they realize. African American writers have contributed some of the most telling pages in our national literature. They do not need spe- cial pleading, but they need to be read fairly and given a chance in the classroom by all of us. As long as they are taught only in segregated courses, only by African American teachers, they will not become a part of the experience of all the teachers and all the students of American literature. Only when a large cross section of the profession is exposed to this literature and becomes sincerely convinced of its intrinsic merit can we sit back and congratulate ourselves. To involve the whole profession, we must welcome women and men of all races and treat the research and teaching of these texts like the serious business that it is. The special issue of PMLA is a wonderful positive step, but Gates notes that previously only three articles in the field of African American literature had ever appeared in the journal. It will be interesting to see how many appear in general issues during the next hundred years. ROBERT E. FLEMING University of New Mexico To the Editor: I am compelled to respond to Henry Louis Gates's introduc- tion to the African and African American special issue. The Division of Black American Literature and Culture hardly emerged from Cambridge. Though even Darwin T. Turner had failed, despite quite conscientious efforts, to establish African and Afro-American literature as part of one unified body in the MLA during the institution of the current format for di- visions, African literature readily secured a division for itself. While the African preference was well in place, the study of indigenous black literature was relegated to the Discussion Group on Afro-American Literature. By 1981, bolstered by Chester J. Fontenot, Jr., and others, the discussion group moved to become a division. After a proposal was petitioned in 1982, the new division began official operation in 1983. Crucial to the application were many letters of support from African Americanists of all persuasions, notably from Turner, who provided a handwritten history and appeal; Houston Baker, who wrote a long letter on Penn stationery; William An- drews, who stood by the idea; and Keneth Kinnamon, who gave general support. Joseph N. Weixlmann, Jr., the conscientious editor of Black American Literature Forum, was receptive to the request that the journal become the official organ of the body. Several years later Jerry Ward and others would formalize the arrangement within the MLA hierarchy. Though Henry Louis Gates would not appear on the centennial program in New York in 1983-and would not indeed become influential in the association until 1986-Houston Baker graciously volun- teered to appear in a session entitled The Legacy of George E. Kent, hence honoring the only black scholar to be valued in this way. Besides Kent, who is omitted from the Gates canon of twenty- five meritorious scholars, I would document the importance of traditional Americanists (Thadious Davis and Kenny J. Wil- liams) who have pioneered diverse opportunities for blacks; extremely productive black women (Barbara Christian, Valerie Smith, Frances Smith Foster, Nellie Y. McKay, and Trudier Harris) who have seized their own intellectual independence from any prescribed school such as that of structuralism and poststructuralism; and Europeans as well as Euro-Americanists (Jean Wagner, Barbara Johnson, Phyllis Klotman, John Riley, and Michel Fabre), who have sought to authenticate black lit- erature on its own terms. I point to the professional contributions of Hammett Worthington-Smith and Arlene Clift, who paved the way for the division as we now know it, and R. Victoria Arana and Joyce Joyce, well-respected scholars who have hosted recep- tions for the division in Washington-first in 1984, the year immediately following the inception of the body, and once more in 1989. Though several friends have called to express absolute incredulity at one more omission from the voices empowered by Gates, I insist that he has every academic freedom to canonize the critics he values. Here it will suffice to say that the invisible man appeared on the MLA program fourteen times in the last decade; wrote and revised the proposal for the divi- sion; wrote and revised the proposal of the only black-author society ever to achieve allied-organization status; and wrote or edited several books reviewed well at home and abroad. Gates, in tone and idea, on the contrary, introduces an edited text of PMLA that would displace the performed voicing of black America within the MLA itself. His rhetorical strategy skill- fully revoices the quest for the Euro-American audience on its own terms, reminding us perhaps of my superb white student who proposed once that the classic distinction between Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Du Bois was that the former in- sisted on giving the world what it wanted whereas the latter in- tended to give it what it needed. The Gates solution-as proposed by classical rhetoric-is to speak within the language that now has democratic favor, hence reinforcing the idiom already imprisoning our thought. The abandonment of "quotas," he says, has facilitated the ad- mission of women to "heretofore elite male institutions" (my italics; 13). Simultaneously, the "acceptance" of black litera- ture in the States has "improved dramatically" since 1985-all of this now happily verified by the "continuous searches" (my italics) for junior and senior professors of African American, African, or postcolonial literatures. While African Americanists (but surely not white Africanists) are commonly competed for nationally (his partial fiction reads), institutions do mistakenly conflate the issues of affirmative action and true excellence in black studies. It is the profoundly reactionary subtext of the Gates posi- tion that is so troubling. His arbitrarily imposed bifurcation of textuality and history reduces the very process of textual speaking-the being of textuality-to the impotent parameters of merely inscribed and signified forms. But the literary body is anthropomorphic, partaking of not only its own verbal world but its own life; this is the reason that Coleridge's use of the term organic was so apropos not only in the suggestion of a structural relation of interwoven strands but in the vitality (the essence) of literary art. 1124</page><page sequence="3">1125 Hence, Gates creates a subtext of valuing linguistic forms and the linguistic revoicing of even earlier linguistic forms, while ignoring what surely connects them-the consciousness to revoice and rewrite the place or status of the racial self in Euro- American history. Gates prefers to believe that racial essential- ism must be either textually or socially immanent rather than ontologically creative. He implies, in other words, that race is either a social or a linguistic process but is almost never a qualitative and active expression of human intelligence as well as of literary art. Yet it is precisely this last process that trans- forms the reading of sterile "texts" into the more valuable read- ing of "works," vindicating the communal mission of the humanities. My very talented-but sometimes misguided-colleague in- scribes himself as a textually archetypal structuralist who prefers to erase the process of human knowing from critical knowledge. Personally, I find his rather prescriptively narrow posture neither unthinkable nor uninteresting. But it is quite unlivable. What unifies his voice in the beginning with that of the gifted Soyinka at the end is the sacrosanct metaphor of Cambridge. R. BAXTER MILLER University of Tennessee, Knoxville Reply: I thank R. Baxter Miller for his witty history of the Divi- sion of Black American Literature and Culture, but readers who have to infer my introduction from his remarks will have a dif- ficult task. They may be surprised to discover that I made no pretense of discussing the history of that division. That I never thought to chart the institutional history of African Ameri- can literary study. Now I did, for the sake of schematism, dis- cuss the proceedings of three conferences, two of which were sponsored by the MLA, that seemed to instantiate the develop- ments that came in the later seventies. But I was never foolhardy enough even to attempt to invoke the names of the major critics of black literature, then and now. Miller is rather less cautious than I in this respect. So on his behalf, let me try to calm fu- ture correspondents who will be shocked-shocked-at the names curiously omitted from his roster of "important" critics. For surely it is implicit in his piece (as it was explicit in mine) that he meant only to provide an institutional cross section of convenience and had no ambition to be exhaustive. I fear some readers may be puzzled by Miller's references to Cambridge, which (I assume) have to do with an autobiograph- ical anecdote about the resistance I faced when I set out to study black literature at graduate school in England. I compared my experience unfavorably with the much more receptive environ- ment generally found in the American academy today. Miller thinks this rendered Cambridge "sacrosanct," by which logic his letter must be a praise song in my honor. If Miller finds my view that you needn't be black to teach black literature "profoundly reactionary," I am more troubled by the converse view that would disallow black scholars from teaching Milton. But I despair of pleasing Miller. Having re- cently published an article attacking me for using an inacces- sible critical vocabulary, he now faults me for speaking "within the language that now has democratic favor." Miller would have me be more alert to "the being of textuality," the organic "es- sence" of literary art, and the "ontologically creative" nature of racial essentialism. As seductive as these Heideggerian vir- tues are, I can't be the only one who would hesitate to shackle another generation of critics with such Schwarzwald-school pieties. Miller offers us a vision of black lit. crit. as a rather club- bish affair, complete with seniority rules, in which I myself hardly qualify as a full-fledged member. I would be the last to criticize Miller's devotion to the professional establishment and its official MLA-sponsored institutions. And I deeply regret it if Miller feels slighted in his role as an organizer (this "per- formed voicing of black America within the MLA itself"). But it may be useful to remind ourselves that the Modern Language Association was not the birthplace of black literary criticism either. And while I wish Miller had paid as much attention to my text as to its supposed subtext, I'd be remiss to ignore the plan- gent subtext of his letter. So let me state for the record that I had no involvement in the selection process of the PMLA is- sue in question, which was conducted through blind review by a number of specialists in the field. At the same time, I wish to convey my apologies to Miller for any hurt feelings thereby aroused. HENRY LOUIS GATES, JR. Duke University Martin Luther King, Jr., and His Sources To the Editor: I have happily taught the essays of Martin Luther King, Jr., in my community college classes for years, but after reading Keith D. Miller's "Composing Martin Luther King, Jr." (105 [1990]: 70-82), which documents King's unacknowledged "bor- rowings" in "Pilgrimage to Nonviolence," I am not certain I will ever be able to do so again with a clear conscience. You see, I teach the research paper in those classes too. And what Miller calls "borrowing," we who teach freshman English call plagiarism (a word that, incidentally, never occurs in the arti- cle). And we don't like it. We fail students who commit it. We try to have them dropped from our classes, even, in egregious cases, from our college community (for example, the student who submitted to my colleague a "borrowed" paper in which he neglected to replace the original writer's name with his own). But we always give the student a hearing, so let's listen to Miller: 1. Is the plagiarism intentional or accidental? Miller implies that it is deliberate when he says that "[b]y substantially exag- gerating the significance of his formal education at white gradu- ate schools, King's essay masks a careful process of self-making . . ." (71). And the comparative passages that he quotes throughout the article and in the appendixes display a word- for-word similarity seldom accidental. 2. Is the plagiarism incidental or blatant? Miller uncovers in King's essay the most inexcusable form of plagiarism, in Forum</page></plain_text>
