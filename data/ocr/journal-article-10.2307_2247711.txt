<plain_text><page sequence="1">III.-THE FUNCTION OF RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION. BY HENRY RUTGERS MARSHALL. ? 1. In the article that has preceded this, as the reader will remember, we found ourselves led to the conclusion that there are many influences in our complex social life which, if unrestrained, tend to produce an over-emphasis of variance from typical forms of action, and to subvert the order of instinct efficiency which has been formed in us and which we judge must be of value to our race in its struggle for supremacy. This suggested to us that there might be developed within us a governing instinct functioniing to prevent this over-emphasis and this subversion, and led us to look for some signs of the existence of such a governing instinct. In the very beginning of this search the fact was forced upon us that some of the most characteristic activities con- nected with the expression of our religious feelings must tend to produce the very results that our governinig instinct if existent would itself tend to produce. This in turn led us to ask whether religious activities are to be classed as in- stinctive; and finding evidence that they must probably be so classed and remembering that all instincts have biological functions, the hypothesis naturally suggested itself that the function of the activities expressive of the religious instinct is to emphasise within us instinct in general and to sub- ordinate variance; to strengthen the instincts of wider iin- port and to subordinate those that are less wide in their influence although occasionally more powerfully developed; to establish a certain order of impulse efficiency which if effective will bring those instincts that are of individualistic import into subjection, under certain conditions, to those that function in relation to the persistence of the species and to bring both of these classes of instincts, in general, into subjection to the instincts that have social import. This hypothesis must be judged by a study of the effects</page><page sequence="2">THE FUNCTION OF RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION. 183 produced by the very varied expressions of religious feeling(. Such a study I could not attempt to make in a single article, even in outline, were it not that the many forms of religious expression naturally fall into a few groups which we may find space to consider briefly. I shall attempt in the case of each group to show that the persistence of these special activities cannot be explained on the ground that they either appear to be or are in fact of individualistic advantage, nor on the ground that they tend to advantage in relation to the processes governing the re- production of kind. On the other hand I think it will appear that they do serve to emphasise the order of impulse efficiency already referred to, bringing into prominence the social impulses and tending thus to produce persistence of the higher social types. We are able then to account for their persistence in our race; for, as we have seen, it is advantageous to us to emphasise the social instincts which make possible the existence of these social types; for these social instincts could not have arisen in us unless the actions they induce were of advantage, indirectly at least, in the maintenanice of the life of the indi- viduals and species in which they appear. ? 2. It will serve our purpose best at the start to say a few words concerning the form in which this emphasis of the later formed instincts would present itself to consciousness. If the argument which has preceded this be correct, if the later formed instincts relating to social life are effective rather through the wide general trend of the activities they induce than through the forcefulness or quickness of reaction to the stimuli which call them out, then it seems clear that they will not be likely to force themselves upon our atten- tioil as the impulses of individualistic significance, and those relating to reproduction, will surely do; for these latter are called into existence by presentations of forceful nature and must in a large proportion of cases function promptly if they are to be of service. But where, for any reason, stimulation to individualistic reaction is absent, and where the instincts relating to re- production are not called out, then the tendency to act in accord with the trend determined by the social instincts must necessarily become more prominent and the ethical impulses must sway our lives. Now the primitive man in whom these social instincts are beginning to develop will with difficulty have his attention turned to the existence of the impulses they determine</page><page sequence="3">184 HENRY RUTGERS MARSHALL: except under conditions of individualistic restraint which are foreign to the habits of the savage; he would therefore with difficulty recognise them as definite impulses, as dis- tinct leadings; and they would be likely first to gain marked attention if they happened to appear in the form of hal- lucinations- which would startle the one who saw the hallucinatory vision or heard the hallucinatory voice, and would gain power with him, and with the neighbours to whom he told his tale, because of his and their crude animistic beliefs, which naturally led them to look for the manifestation of spirit life in all objects around them. It of course cannot be claimed that all hallucinations occasion emphasis of the later formed and higher impulses, for hallucinations are miorbid phenomena and naturally appear persistently in neurotic patients. On the other hand, however, it is true that a great deal of hallucination does emphasise in a morbid way the higher impulses and does produce ethical inania and religious melancholia: Emerson 1 went so far indeed as to remark that a " certain tendency to insanity has always attended the opening of the religious sense of men as if they had been 'blasted with excess of light'". But all that concerns us here is to note, that the condi- tions which tend to induce these hallucinatory states are the very conditions which would restrain all tendency to indi- vidualistic reaction and would leave opportunity for the less forceful but broader impulses to assert themselves. In extreme states of hallucinatory impression the one im- pressed falls into what we know as the trance state. In trance states some or all of the senses which bring to us our knowledge of the outer world are usually benumbed: the person " stares at vacancy" perhaps, or pays no attention whatever to his or her surroundings, and in general shows a total lack of that power to concentrate the attention upon the outer world at large which is so necessary for the per- ception of those objective conditions in the enivironment which lead to individualistic reactions. The one who per- ceives the hallucination may indeed fall into a state which is so morbid as to be indistinguishable from catalepsy. Where hallucination is not accompanied by such morbid conditions, we nevertheless have of necessity a repressionl of reaction to environmental stimuli, and a concentration of thought upon states of purely subjective origin; how else can we explain the higher emphasis of those subjective mpare his essay " The Over Soul ".</page><page sequence="4">THE FUNCTION OF RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION. 185 states, the deceptive perceptions, which are not stimulated from without us, and which psychologically speaking make the essence of the hallucinations we are considering? Where the processes, which when carried to extremes produce hallucinations, are not carried to extremes, mental states similar to those accompanying hallucination will obtain; consequently if any benefit were ever connected with the attainment of true hallucinations, the same benefit in less degree would be likely to be gained by the person who followed the practices which often lead to hallucination, who even aimed to attain the hallucination, whether he succeeded or not in his endeavour. What is more, these closely allied mental states would be closely related by the one who had once experienced hallucination to his: more startling experience; so that it appears not at all obscure why it has become common custom to speak of our con- sciousness of the pressure of our impulses as though voices spoke within us, guiding our lives. There is no fiction more general and none more beautiful thani that which tells us of the " still small voice of conscience ". It will be convenient to use this metaphor from time to time, and I am sure I shall inot be misunderstood in so doing. It will appear upon examination that the various groups of religious expression which we shall exam-line tend to pro- duce the suppression of individualistic reaction, and lead us to listen for the guiding voices within us; and that if carried to extremes they end often in the production of true halluci- nations during which the influences from the objective world are largely cut off and notions of purely subjective origin are falsely objectified. Before beginning our study in detail I must speak again of one point which will apply to all the religious expressions to be examined. Notwithstanding all that was said in the last article of this series there is likely to be a confirmed impression in the minds of some readers that religious habits are forced upon the race altogether by tradition and custom; that we undertake them purely as the result of our imitative tendencies. I have already stated why I believe this notion to be with- out foundation: although it is doubtless true that many of our religious habits are thus acquired by one generation from the preceding generation; still it is to be noted that when certain fixed habits appear in wide masses of people, and where they persist for long historic periods, then we are warranted in the assumption that the tendency to follow the</page><page sequence="5">186 HENRY RUTGERS MARSHALL: actions of the preceding generation is due to an inborn trend and capacity, especially if the actions " imitated " appear to the individual to be disadvantageous to him or to his race, or are distastefuil to him in any degree, directly or indirectly. In the case of the actions which we are about to study, not only do we find this persistence in wide groups of men but we find a common source acknowledged as the basis of the most varied types of actions; and we find also, as I hope to show, a common trend of all to one special biological benefit, notwithstanding that marked disadvantage appears at the firs-t glance to be connected with them all. ? 3. In what I have already written I have given so much prominence to the religious habits connected with voluntary seclusion from the stimuli of our complex life, that it is natural to begin our study with an examination of this form of religious expression. It will not require discussion to convince the reader that seclusion from the exciting stimuli of the world will tend to reduce those reactions upon our environment which deter- mine the expression of the individualistic instincts, and that seclusion will thus give play to the impulses which are of non-individualistic import. Seclusion involves a tendency to fixation of thought upon our inner springs of action, and wheni carried to extremes naturally tends to produce hallucination. The experience of man in the early stages of his development must have led to the observation that what we call halluciniatory voices or visions, but wbich he believed to emanate from higher powers, were often noticed by men during involuntary seclusion; the voice had spoken, the vision had appeared, again arid again to those who were alone in the desert, far removed from the distractions of normal life. Now to the man of undeveloped type these voices and visionls must have been very impressive. In times of great danger or perplexity the guidance of these higher powers, as they were conceived, might be wished for; and this might lead somie individual to seclude himself voluntarily because he entertained the hope, which would be discovered in some cases to be well founded, that this mysterious guidance might thus be obtained. But here I would ask my reader to note an imiportant point; viz., that while we may thus account for the appearance of the habits of seclusion in individuals, on the other hand it is not at all easy on ally such basis to account for the persistence of these habits in the race; persistence which is implied in the fact that they have at length become</page><page sequence="6">THE FUNCTION OF RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION. 187 instinctive. For the occasions when- such guidance would be wished for must surely have been relatively very infre- quent; and it is difficult to understand how such occasions could occur with sufficient frequency to develop the habits that were finally to become instinctive. It would be possible to explain the acquisition of such habits indeed if, there having been some exceptional re- currence of fear or perplexity to foster them, the habits themselves or their accompaniments had been intrinsically attractive; but such they very clearly could not have been. For evidently the painfulness, the danger, the hardship coni- nected with the life of the man who thus secluded himself from his fellows must have been apparent to all. What is more, the very guidance in halluciniatory form which he might occasionally gain in seclusion must have been conl- joined in his minid with a very decided repulsion; for men as we know them surely display no special wish to be startled by hallucinations; rather are they wont to dread ghostly forms and voices; and we have every reason to believe that our savage ancestors were still more averse to these mysterious sights and sounds than the average man is to-day. This being true, evidently aniy habits which tended to produce these hallucinations would naturally be avoided, if in any case the connexi-on between habit and result were recognised. This fear of hallucinations would therefore act to prevent the acquisition by intelligent process of such habits of seclusion. It might be possible to claim that the priinitive man to 'whom in his seclusion the hallucinatory inessage was given would gain power and influence, and to hold that on that account his actions would be imitated from purely indi- vidualistic motives by those who envied him this power or influence. In making such an argument, however, we would have to overlook the fact that the power and influenice would not accrue in any deg,ree until after the firm establishmenit of the customs under consideration, and would also fail to consider what an inconsiderable proportion of the " inspira- -tions" that have come thus forcibly to men have brought to them power or honour, comfort or beinefit in life. Think for a moment of the natural revolt that the savage man must have felt, if his owni personal welfare in this world were alonie considered, if once he realised the hardship, with little compensation, in the life of the average hermit who had felt and proclaimed himself to be an inspired prophet. More- over, it must be remembered that the mani who, under the hypothesis we are considering, is supposed to choose this</page><page sequence="7">188 HENRY RUTGERS MARSHALL: life for the emoluments of one kind or another connected with it, must be supposed also to be fairly intelligent, and intelligent enough surely to note that relatively few of those who seek to gain the hallucinatory guidance by this means ever really gain it at all; and this fact is so evident that it would certainly act as a distinct bar to the intelligent and voluntary acquisition of the painful habits, even though they were seen in some few cases to lead to the gain of this guidance. On the whole then I think we must grant that it is impossible to explain the acquisition and persistence of the habits of seclusion which we are considering, under the hypothesis that they are due to intelligent recognition of personal benefits to be obtained from such seclusion. But if we are compelled to grant that the habit of seclu- sion is on the whole one that would be naturally avoided by the man seeking self-satisfaction, we are also compelled to grant that if it did appear in the race it would, in its direct results, be disadvantageous to the individual, and furthermore would be opposed to the persistence of the species. Persistent seclusion must, on the whole, be dangerous to the individual, wbo thus loses the advantages that go with co-operation and mutual help in moments of emergency; and in the early days of man's development, when these habits were becoming ingrained in the race, the dangers con- nected with attack by eniemies and beasts of prey would certainly be areatly increased if the man were unable to avail himself of protection by others of his own kind. I need not say a word to convince any one that the same persistent seclusion fromn the world, if honestly carried out, must necessarily prevent reproductive functioning; and this in itself would tend to eliminate the portion of the race which had acquired these habits of seclusion. It is apparent then, I think, that in connexion iwith the inistinctive actions leading to seclusion, we must look for some other significance than the advantage of the individual or the persistence of the race through reproduction: for without such other significance these habits, even if once acquired, would speedily be eliminated by natural processes through the failure in the struggle for existence of those in whom these habits became predominant. But as a matter of fact, we know that the habits of seclusion which we have under discussion have not been eliminated. A volume might be filled with the names of " saints," and ethical masters, and of hermits, who have found messages of inispiration in their lives of separation from the world. But vast numbers who have received no such messages have</page><page sequence="8">THE FUNCTION OF RELIGIOUS BXPRESSION. 189 in like manner excluded themselves. I need but to mention the monastic orders in the Christian Church and in other religious bodies as examples of the widespread tendenlcy to separation from active life as an expression of religious thought. We find also that amongst large bodies of religious men habits of temporary seclusion have been established; habits which differ from prolonged seclusion in their repul- ,siveness and disadvantage only in degree. And finally when we come to the consideration of the perfectly normal religious habits of perfectly well-balanced people, of men and women of the very highest arid noblest type, we find them with- drawing themselves upon occasion from the distracting stimuli of the world and giving themselves up to higher reflexion and thoughtful self-examination. In cases where men removed from the normal environment receive thus what they feel to be inspirations, these messages are evidently tnot likely to be related to individualistic reac- tions, which in seclusion are not often called for; but are much more likely to be related to those impulses of a social nature which cannot become forcible so long as immediate response to stimuli from the environment is demanded. If this be granted, then it seems to me not at all difficult to comprehend the emphasis in the race of the habits we are considering; most natural to find, as we do, that voluntary seclusion from the world has beer] emphasised ill the habits of religious teachers from the earliest days of history. ? 4. Fasting as an expression of religious feeling naturally comnes before us for consideration at this point, because it has been, and is still, so closely connected with the habits of seclusion that we have just been studying. Indeed, fasting was almost necessarily connected with involuntary separa- tion from the world in the desert; and quite naturally accompanied that seclusion which was undertaken volun- tarily. It is easy then to accounlt for the origin upon occasion of habits of fasting, and we can conceive also how these habits, although arising in connexion with seclusion, might come occasionally to be followed apart from seclusion. But it is difficult, on the other hand, on any theory which implies that fasting was originally undertaken to satisfy individual- istic longings, to understand the persistence of these habits; yet such persistence in the past through many ages is implied in the very existence of an inistinct, the expression of which tends to develop naturally in a large part of the race, as we shall presently see is the case with fasting.</page><page sequence="9">190 HENRY RUTGERS MARSHALL: Surely the painfulness directly or indirectly connected with starvation cannot in itself be attractive. Nor are the hallucinations which arise so often as the result of lack of food attractive in themselves, as we have already seen; nor do they appear to ordinary men to be connected to any great extent with individualistic advantage; consequently in accordance with our argumenit in the last section, we are unable to agree with Tylorl that habits of fasting could have had their origin in the desire of the primitive man to produce voluntarily the exceptional nervous states favourable to the seeing of those visions that are supposed to give to the seer access to the realities of the spiritual world. And even if we could agree that fasting had this origin, it would not seem possible thus to account for its persistence in the race for a sufficient time to have become established as an organic tendency. Nor can we account for the persistence of the fasting habit by reference to Mr. Spencer's somewhat imaginative hypotbesis that fasting had its origin in the starving con- nected with the custom of providing refreshment for the dead; even if this hypothesis be well grounded it can at most account for the genesis, and not for the continuance of the habit. For very clearly the habit is in its direct results niot only of no advantage but of very great disadvantage to the indi- vidual, and hence indirectly to the race of which he is a member; for the ascetic who indulges himself thus, is liable to become weakened to such a degree that he may find him- self incapable of self-protection against the adverse forces in his environment; a fact indeed which the most stupid of savages would be quick to appreciate. But notwithstanding the fact that the custom of fasting altogether fails in attraction, and although it is easily seen to be opposed to individual welfare, still the habit is sur- prisingly persistent. Not only do we hear of the fasting of those great leaders who in the past have seen visions and heard voices guiding them to actions they would not have conceived of under normal conditions; but voluntary fasting is taught as a duty by many religious bodies in our day in all parts of the world; usually indeed in connexion with seclusion more or less rigid. Nor is the habit limited to people of this type, for we find fasting undertaken voluntarily by many pious people who do not at all believe in the hermit- like life of separation fromn one's kind. I Primitive Culture, i., 277, 402; ii., 372.</page><page sequence="10">THE FUNCTION OF RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION. 191 Fasting in excess is a well-recognised means of producing hallucinations; but quite apart from such excesses, fasting in moderation, reducing as it does the vitality sufficiently to overcome any natural demand for spontaneous activities, must clearly aid one very materially to gain that racial in- spiration which most easily arises when reactions of indi- vidualistic significance are not called for. It seems to me then that in this fact we have an adequate explanation of the persistence in the race of this custom. Disadvantageous as the fasting habit might be from a purely individualistic point of view, it thus appears to be of ad- vantage to the race in that it tends to conserve and foster that highly serviceable social grouping of which individuals are elements, and this suffices to account for its continued appearance amongst the individual elements of these social groups which are now in process of evolution. ? 5. In connexion with the consideration of the habit of fasting our thought is nattirally turned to a class of customs expressive of religious fervour which vary greatly in form, anid which in any one form are noted amongst only a relatively small number of the race; all of which however have the one characteristic that they involve the voluntary assumption of bodily pain. The tortures of various kinds which have been undertaken for their own sake, and endured willingly and with joy by the saints of the past, need not be enumerated, and I do not think it worth while to treat of any of them in detail. It would be almost hopeless to attempt to account for these habits, so complex in form, limited in each form to such small numbers, were it not that they are so closely related to the much more uniform habits of religious expression which we have already studied. As we know them in historic times, among the people whom we think of as civilised, they have become closely con- nected with the widespread notion that the hope of salvation of the soul lies in the assumption of an attitude of contempt for the mere physical man. But it is apparent that this conception implies a high degree of intellectual development in the people adopting it, and its adoption must therefore have been late in the history of our race; hence it is most probable that this notion was suggested as a rational excuse for the continuance of religious habits already well estab- lished, but which seemed to require some explanation in accord with reasonable conceptions. Here again we are dealing with habits which are in</page><page sequence="11">192 HENRY RUTGERS MARSHALL: themselves intrinsically unattractive to the individual, and which therefore would not have persisted in the race on account of their individualistic desirability. Moreover, they are habits which are evidently disadvantageous to individuals and would be seen to be so by any set of men of very moderate intelligence. Furthermore, it is evident that in themselves they might not infrequently bring serious dis- advantage to the tribal group. It seems clear, therefore, that there must have at- tached to these practices in the past some important advantage to the race, which has over-balaniced the ever- present individualistic, and the occasional racial, disadvan- tage connected with them. But in the light of our previous studies of the habits of seclusion and fasting so closely connected with these more variable customs, it is not difficult to conceive that this advantage may be found in the aid obtained in connexion with these practices in the ;strengthening of the social instincts. As we have already seen there is every reason to believe that in the states of hallucination which these practices often entail the deeper lying instincts tend to come to the mind: at all events the tendency to spontaneous indi- vidualistic action would be largely reduced by these very weakening processes which induced the hallucinations; and for those who gained these hallucinations the important fact, so far as the persistence of the torture habits is concerned, may not improbably have been the emphasis within the hearers, or the seers, of their tendency to listen for this guidance within themselves, which they thought to be commands to theimi from without. But again we must not forget that the hallucinatory images occur to relatively few even of those who aim to gain them by undergoing these weakening processes; and ,yet the one who fails will be benefited as well as he who finds the more impressive guidance: for he too has gained that suspension of the individualistic tendencies that results from the processes of weakening, and therefore has in- directly gained the emphasis of the slower acting, deeper seated impulses of social import. ? 6. It seems appropriate at this juncture to consider for a moment certain customs connected with the initiation into the mysterious brotherhood of the religious body; cere- monies which are evidently in themselves unattractive, and clearly disadvantageous from a purely individualistic point</page><page sequence="12">THE FUNCTION OF RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION. 193 of view, but which nevertheless have persisted in the race in a most extraordinary manner. If, as we have already argued, the habit of restraint from individualistic reaction has been enforced often by the emphasis of the non-individualistic impulses in their most emphatic form under the abnormal conditions of hallucina- tion; then it is not difficult to see how it might have come to be considered most important by the leaders who had once listened to these voices, or who had once seen these visions, to obtain what were thought to be " inspirations" in this hallucinatory form. More than this, those who were convinced of the value of these hallucinatory states would be naturally led to attempt to induce or even to compel others to gain these experiences. But a large proportion of these rites involve extreme suffering and great physical weakening, which in themselves must be repulsive to the barbarous man, and which evidently are an immediate source of weakness to him and to the tribe at large: furthermore, it is certain that a very small pro- portion of those who submit themselves to these initiatory tortures do in fact gain these "messages"; consequently, even if the origin of these customs can be traced to the desire to gain states of hallucination or to force them upon others, the persistence of these customs cannot be thus explained. And yet, although this be true, on the other hand it is equally true that those who participate in these rites place themselves under conditions that lead naturally to the same advantageous emphasis of the non-individualistic impulses that is given when the trance state is really reached; and it would appear therefore that if the habits connected with attempts to produce by compulsion these hallucinatory states persisted, as they have persisted, it might be not at all because the hallucinations, gained in relatively few cases, could be of value to the average man, but because the habits of restraint and of listening, which are of so much advan- tage to the race, would thus in the main be enforced. We have here then it seems to me adequate explanation of the persistence of the barbarous initiatory rites which were found as we know amongst savage- peoples of olden time and which in somewhat less cruel form have come down to our time in crude forms of religious wor- ship. Here we may note another fact which appears to be of no small value as corroborative of the position above taken; viz., the fact that the performance of these initia- 13</page><page sequence="13">194 HENRY RUTGERS MARSHALL: tory rites is very closely related to the approach of the age of puberty in the active participants.' That this relation between the tiine of the enforcement of these initiatory rites and the growth of sexual capacity is one to be expected seems to me clear; for at the age of puberty the boy and the girl have suddenly forced upon them racial leadinas that have never before been felt; at this period of their lives they are compelled to attend to cravings of an organic nature that demand satisfaction and yet which are based upon no personal experience of previous satisfactions. The boy and the girl then become perforce introspective; and it is at this moment that the general teaching to listen to the "voices" within them would be most likely-to prove effective. ? 7. I shall now ask my reader to turn from the study of modes of religious expression which, wheni carried to excess, so often lead to the productioni of hallucinations, to the con- sideration of a special habit which of all religious habits is the most widely prevailing and the most persistent, and yet which in itself seldom if ever leads to the production of hallucinatory states. I refer to the habit of prayer. In studying the habits of seclusion, of fasting, and of self- torture, we have had to deal with the theory that they -originated and have persisted in the race because of the im- pressive hallucinations which they not infrequently occasion; but in relation to the habit of prayer such a theory can scarcely be upheld. On the other hand there are many indications that prayer in its inception must have arisen in connexion with efforts to obtain mercy from human conquerors in the bloody con- tests which must have been common amongst the early ancestors of our race. Its expressive attitudes themselves tell this story. He who prays is found prostrate on the ground; or kneeling, with hands clasped, with head bowed, with eyes closed; and all these attitudes are suggestive of powerlessness to attack; of absence of aggressive tendencies; and of willingness to become the slave of a conqueror, and to listen and obey his command. Habits thus acquired to meet the exigencies of savage life, might continue in force during those greater emergencies which from time to time come upon man apart from human agency, because of the notion that the peril in which the 1 Cf. "c The New Life," A. H. Daniels. American Journal of Psychology, vol. vi., 1.</page><page sequence="14">THE FUNCTION OF RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION. 195 savage found himself placed was the expression of the hostility of higher beings, of a God who was an avenging power, and whom the savage believed he must have offended. But even if we suppose these habits of action to have thus originated they very clearly could not have persisted in the race because of the advanitage that was thus supposed to attend them. They certainly could not have had the ad- vantage to the individual in relation to his God that their prototypes originally bad in relation to the conquering warrior; we recognise full well that the anthropomorphic conception of an avenging Deity fails under rigid examina- tionl. But beyond the fact that these habits of action had not the individualistic advantage which may not unnaturally have been attributed to them by uncivilised mien, they clearly must have been in themselves far from advantageous to the individual exhibiting them; for there being no all- powerful mysterious enemy ready to attack man, actions which in moments of danger, or perplexity, blinded the savage to real dangers, and which induced him to assume attitudes in which alertness was altogether precluded, might often lead to his great individual disadvantage; and they might thus also often bring indirect disadvantage to the race of which he formed a part. And even where direct danger was not incurred, it surely could be of no direct service to an individual to assume attitudes which preclude reaction to the forces in his environment, while still re- maining in a state of mental stress which would preclude his gaining any of the recuperative force which comes with the inactivity of rest. It seems to me clear then that the tribes in which these prayer habits became markedly developed would have suffered in the contest for survival, unless connected with these habits there had been some indirect and unrecognised advantage of sufficient force to overbalance the disadvantages above spokeni of; and if it appear that these habits have persisted, then we are bound to assume that they had some special racial values quite different from those originally attributed to them. It is unnecessary for me to say even one word to show that the habit of prayer is an exceedingly persistent one in the race, having been characteristic of religious expression from the very earliest times, and being one of the most widespread of all habits of action with which we are acquainted. When we ask ourselves what this indirect racial advantage</page><page sequence="15">196 HENRY RUTGERS MARSHALL: could have been that has led to the persistence of habits of prayer, our attention is again directed to the fact that all the bodily attitudes connected with prayer amongst devotees in the past, and amongst religious peoples of our own day, imply restraint and the listening for command; the calling for help and the awaiting for answer and direction; and we perceive that the mental attitude which these expressions involve is, as we have seen, the very one that would tend to subordinate the individual variant tendencies to the racial tendencies, that would lead to the suppression of individual- istic reaction, and thus give opportunity for the slower acting racial impulses of broader scope to make themselves felt. - I think then that it may be held to be in the highest degree probable that the advantage connected with the hearing of the "voice," with the accompanying emphasis of racial impulses within us, must have led to the persistence of habits of prayer, whatever may have been the origin of these habits. ? 8. Sacrifice is a religious custom which I do not need to tell my reader has been fixed in the race from the earliest days of which history and archoeology tell us. The human sacrifice, the sacrifice of bull, of ram. of lamb, of precious goods involving destruction in all cases of what is valuable and useful; these and closely allied sacrificial customs have indeed tended gradually to disappear with the advance of civilisation. But the sacrificial custom remains with us in its essentials, expressed in the actions connected with the belief that the giving up of valued goods, and the voluntary relinquishment of that in life which we value most highly, are acts of worship that please our God and that are effica- cious to our salvation. We mav take it for granted I think that in all probability these habits had their origin in attempts by men to gain individualistic advantage; to appease the wrath of enemies, and to ward off dangers that appeared in connexion with the action of their neighbours. But it is very clear that when these actions were undertakenl in order to satisfy the wrath not of a conquering foe but of a supposedly irate Deity, as we know them to have been, they could not have had the same direct individualistic, or less direct racial, ad- vantage; those who performed the sacrificial rite could not have gained for themselves or for their children the benefits they imagined they were thus to obtain. It is probable then that these habits would not have tended to be impressed upon the race by Nature, unless they had been in themselves</page><page sequence="16">THE FUNCTION OF RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION. 197 essentially attractive, or unless they brought to those who practised them other advantages than any that were realised. But we do not have to say a word to show that sacrifice must have been essentially unattractive to the primitive man, involving as it did much loss of precious things gathered together with much labour which itself was abhorrent to his soul. Moreover sacrifice evidently involves reduction of individual resources and capacities, and danger therefore not only to the individual but to his tribe from those enemies who had not thus reduced their resources. We must look then for other advantages than any that appear on the surface in order to account for the persistence of these customs. After the argument that has preceded this, I scarcely need to tell my reader that my thesis in reference to these, as in reference to the other religious customs already discussed, is that they have been enforced by Nature because of their value in establishing the mental attitude of submission of the will to the commands- of God, as men have expressed it; or in other words in establishing the habit of the restraint of individualistic tendencies, and of appeal to the guidance of the racial impulses of social import. The truth of this is evidenced in the very fact that the term sacrifice has been directly transferred in common language to apply to the voluntary renunciation or re- pression of individualistic tendencies; the termn "self-sacri- fice" in our everyday speech has come to mnean self-restraint. Moreover the very attitudes assumed in connexion with sacrifice are ones which are most valuable in the production of a full imieasure of reverential awe, which would prepare those who watched the ceremonial to give attention to what came to them as commands from those conducting the sacrifice. The mere process of looking up withdraws our attention from the distracting objects around us, and arouses in us the powerful feelings accompanying the recognition of our own littleness, of the sublimity of what is not of ourselves, as all must realise who have lifted up their eyes to the mouiitain peaks, or who have worshipped in the noble naves of the Gothic cathedrals. The smoke arising from the altar naturally led the worshipper to follow with his eyes its up- ward curves, as does the incense burning in the ceremonial of to-day; led himn naturally therefore to assume a reverential attitude of mind. But beyond this, these physical attitudes tended to induce in him conditions distinctly opposed to the production of individualistic activities and therefore well calculated to</page><page sequence="17">198 HENRY RUTGERS MARSHALL: bring him into, and keep him in, the frame of mind in which the voice of conscience could mlost easily be attended to. But above all we must remember that the sacrifice in all religious ceremnonial led up to prayer; and the value of prayer in bringing about the advantageous subordination of individualism we have already spoken of at length in the, preceding section. Celibacv, or the voluntary renunciation of the pleasures of' sexual and family life, is a form of self-sacrifice which is wide- spread as a custom connected with religious devotion. It! is without doubt true that not a small number of professed celibates do not altogether refrain from the gratification of their sexual passions; and yet if we eliminate this class of pretenders it must be acknowledged that an iinportant proportion of men and women in all historic ages have voluntarily quenched their sexual appetites in assuming the celibate's vow. That this voluntary assumption carries with it individual distress of marked type will not be disputed, and it is not possible to believe that it has been or is undertaken because of the intrinsic attractions connected with it. That it is also on its face distinctly disadvantageous to the individual and acts in opposition to the persistence of the species is also clear. That it cannot directly conduce to the persistence of the race is evident when we consider that if it were carried beyond narrow limits it would lead to tribal extinction. That it is disastrous to many an individual life is also certain; for all who have knowledge of the sub- ject will agree that the life of the celibate is beset with many dangers, in that it tends, as alienists tell us, to bring into existence extremnely morbid mental conditions. On the other hand we cannot but realise that these morbid mental conditions are just the ones that are liable to lead to the production of hallucinations, and that in adopting the celibate's life therefore one takes a step which is not unlikely to bring to him hallucinatory messages, which themselves might be thought to be desirable as guides from another world; and this might lead individuals to voluntary assumption of this form of self-sacrifice. But in a previous section we have seen reason to agree that no such individualistic desire can account for the per- sistence of habits inducing these hallucinatory states; for to the mass of men hallucinations are far fromn attractive; moreover, we do not forget that to the mass of celibates no such hallucinatory messages are given. Here again, how-</page><page sequence="18">THE FUNCTION OF RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION. 199 ever, as with all other customs which are likely to produce hallucinations, we realise that those who acquire the habit, but fail to receive the message, nevertheless do gain in some measure an emphasis of those impulses which are of broader than individualistic significance. In this case the influences which are of a sexual nature being curbed, there is greater opportuinity for the " higher" instincts of later development, for the ethical instincts of social import, to become prominent in mind. The very fact that the sexual nature is kept in check forces its demands upon the indi- vidual upon occasion while youth and health remain, and thus the celibate's attention is necessarily guided to those voices within him which can only be heard when one turns to introspective examination. This habit of introspective consideration, as thus aided, being once acquired will cer- tainly bring about an enforcement throughout all of life of those impulses of an ethical nature which, as we have seen, require time for their development because they relate to general trends of action which appear only when we study long series of subordinate activities; impulses which can- not appear clear if our attention is fixed upon the individual- istic demands of the moment, from which the celibate deliberately attempts to cut himself off. ? 9. I must say a word here concerning the custom of making pilgrimages which has been of widespread occur- rence among many religious people. This custom evidently involves individual hardship, per- sonal loss and tribal weakening; nor does it show on its face the distinct advantages in the direction of social ad.vancement that I have been aiming to show exist in the case of all other notable religious exercises. But the reader will recall, I think, that in the last article of this series I mentioned that we should expect to find that the social impulses would tend to be made dominant by actions which brought into strong relief the outlines of the social fabric; which emphasised the fact that there are social bonds, that there exists community of interests which must be dominant even where individual likings are oc- casionally crushed out, that mutual aid is necessary to our welfare as individual elements in social life. The efficiency of these pilgrimages in this direction can- not be questioned: and it seems to me there can be no doubt that their value has been quite in line with that attached to the other religious habits that we have been studying, when we consider that they ended in sacrifice, in prayer, and in</page><page sequence="19">200 HENRY RUTGERS MARSHALL: other acts of devotion, these acts indeed being carried on with less emphasis during the pilgrim's journey and being looked forward to in their culmination from day to day. This value of action in common with others of our race in the enforcement of the ethical impulses is clear I think in the development of worship in community, of which we cannot stop to speak at length notwithstandinig the very great importance of the subject: and I may add that the same value attaches to the development of religious societies, and to the conventions and councils, the conferences and congresses, of religious people which are so marked a feature of our later civilisation. ? 10. In looking back at the habits of religious people in the past as a whole I think we cannot fail to realise that the most important of all religious activities have been, as they still are, the customs which bring the common man to gain the attitude of prayer in companionship with his fellow-man; and this because when men gather in great miasses they unwittingly learn of their social dependence, this impression adding to the force of religious ceremonial in tending to repress the emphasis of individualistic impulses. Among the lower races some individual gains in one way or another the habit of restraint; he sees a vision, inotices a voice commanding him, or perhaps inerely hears the " still small voice of conscience ". He interprets this as an inspiration, as a revelation, as a message from his God. He tells this to his people, amid if be be a man of force they, dimly feeling the imnpulse which he feels powerfully, obey his call, which answers to some extent to the vague impulses within themselves. They call him their prophet; his God becomes their God and with their prophet they learn to pray. He teaches them to assume the attitudes of prayer which have been effective for himself anid which in turn also become effective in enabling them, his followers, to hear the voice that is leading him. But there must be those who cannot hear the voice even thus, and to such we should expect to find teaching given by the ethical leaders; as a matter of fact this habit of teaching is universal with all higher developments of religious custom. Having through fear or other means produced in his hearers the attitude of mind in which they are best able to hear the " voice," the prophet teaches them what this "voice" has said to himself, and if he be an ethical genius he blows into flame a fire that was ready to</page><page sequence="20">THE FUNCTION OF RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION. 201 kindle within the souls of his hearers; he calls to their attention impulses which they recognise as their own when he tells of them, impulses however which they would not have perceived had he not spoken to them. ? 11. If the preceding argument has appealed to my reader he will agree that the function of religion which lies back of its ceremonial is the suppression of the force of individualistic, elemental impulses in favour of those which have higher significance. But we have seen in what has preceded this that the latest elaboration of the tendency to elemental variance is what we know as Reason. And it is equally clear I think that in self-restraint and individualistic suppression, in the cry for aid and guidance, we gain that complex psychic state which we know under the name of Faith. It would appear then that in relatioin to our modern coinplex and self-conscious intellectual life the function of religion will lie to a great extent in the restraint of Reason and its sub- ordination to Faith. It is most natural then to find that religious leaders in all later times have emphasised this teaching. Especially in the teachiing of the Christian Church do we find ever recurrent this dictum that reason must be subordinated to faith. ? 12. Here our argument must rest. In what has pre- ceded this I have written with no desire to make thorough- going explanations, in conformity with the notions of modern scieince, of the religious experiences of the past and of those that influence us in our day. So far as such explanations are possible and desirable they have been presented more fully aind more ably than I could hope to perform any similar work even if I wished to attempt it. What I have been concerned to suggest is a reply to the question which forces itself upon our notice. If Religion be an instinct which has been acquired by the human race, what special function does it serve in the development of our race ? Although Nature in forming this religious instinct mnay have built it up (so to speak) out of habits formed for other purposes, using them as they served her higher end; still it may well be claimed I think that these habits have to a great extent persisted not because of their original values, but on account of their worth to the race as meanis of emphasising the subordinatioin of the variailt individual principle to the racial principle; of repressing the linmediate</page><page sequence="21">202 HENRY RUTGERS MARSHALL: response to impulses which are only of individual import,. and compelling delay until those of more far-reaching importanrice can present themselves; of forcing upon us the habit of waiting for and subordinating ourselves to what is conceived of as the command from a power higher, than any recognised in our immediate natural surroundings; of enforcing the habit of listening to the " still small voice of conscience This, it seems to me, we may well claim to be the main function of religious expression, a function of sufficient importance to account for the persistence in the race of the habits related to religious service. Yet it nmust be noted that this claim does not preclude the existence of other functions of value to life, which may be pointed out by somne writer more familiar than I arn with biological lore.. And especially must it be noted that this claim does not in. any way indicate that in gaining a conception of the bio- logical functioning of religious expression, we have sounded the depths of the significance of religion itself to the souls of men existent in this Universe, which we so imperfectly comprehend. ? 13. And now, in closing this article, I must ask my reader to recur once more to the thought so often reiterated,. that the religious customs we have been considerin-g are all tools, so to speak, which Nature has used to enforce re- straint; and I wish to emphasise the fact that this restraint is of the very core and essence of religious functioning. Many a man declines to call himself religious because he cannot subscribe to the dogmatic statement of special religious bodies; because he cannot bring himself to join with them in worship, or to follow their habits or customns. But if my analysis be correct he may be, for all that, a, thoroughly religious man; provided only he finds within him an impulse persistently leading him to restrain his individualism and to give his social instincts full play; provided he strives to follow the order of impulse emphasis. which Nature is eindeavouring to impress upon him, in order to produce in him the subordination of the individualistic. instincts, as modified with relation to reproduction, to those. which have social significance; provided, in other words, he, lives a life subject to the call of duty. Many such men we know who are without the bounds of the Churches. This leads us to see that if we take a slightly different view we may state our conclusion in terms more strictly</page><page sequence="22">THE FUNCTION OF RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION. 203 ethical. The space at my command precludes the possi- bility of dealing adequately with such a statement, but I think the reader will agree that we find ourselves led to hold that the religious instinct, if we allow ourselves to be guided by it, compels us to act out the best that is in us impulsively, without the necessity of waiting for the slow processes of argument and conviction. It does not in itself perfect our moral code, that is a matter of individual development and individual effort; but it does serve the purpose of giving to us an instinctive tendency to express and to strengthen the best that is ours by Nature's gift, as our moral life unfolds. This it is that a man gains when he falls under the sway of the religious instinct: a tendency has arisen within him to give his bigher instincts full play, a tendency which itself has become instinctive.</page></plain_text>
