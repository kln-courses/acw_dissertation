Now, when the profane "Hollywood hacks" of the Thirties and Forties have become auteurist divinities, Flaherty can just barely be noticed in a remote niche: the Brattleboro reliquary. Ironically, the icons erected in his name have fudged our perspective and ob- scured his stature. For Flaherty is not so completely other that we cannot ap- proach his career with the same unawed respect we (should) bring to a Hitchcock or a McCarey. Otherwise, critical filmog- raphies can turn into gaga hagiogra- phies, in which neither the filmmaker nor the art of criticism is served. Movies were not meant to be seen from a kneeling position. Flaherty once said, "First I was an explorer; then I was an artist." For him, the journey was at least as important as reaching the destination. And, in one sense, his films are so many flags mark- ing the ends of expeditions into Hudson Bay, Samoa, the Aran Islands, India, the American heartland, the billabong bayous of Louisiana. In another sense, of course, these films- nanook of the NORTH (1 922), MOANA (1 926), MAN OF ARAN (1934), ELEPHANT BOY (1937), THE LAND (1941), and Louisiana story (1948)- mark Flaherty's excursions into various regions of the human soul, to discover elemental truths, and to project them onto the mind-screens of the rest of us, who may have forgotten them in our century- long rush toward catatonic computerism. But, though these truths may not have been self-evident, Flaherty was hardly the only filmmaker to hold them. Indeed, there are enough similarities between him and Ford, Chaplin, Borzage, even Disney, to place him in a tradition of the romantic- visionary American. Flaherty has been accused, in his film explorations, of finding only what he was looking for: the Innocent Eye as Cyclops. As he grew older, this may have been truer, for moana and man of aran can be seen as spin-offs from the nanook story line. But in his finest films, nanook and the land, he simply saw the truth and brought it home. These films stand at opposite ends of Flaherty's psychical spectrum. Nanook was his response to a subject with which his nature was in complete harmony; the land was an atonal wail of compassionate horror. Standing alone among his works, they also stand tallest. Seen today, Flaherty's first film is something of a revelation as both artwork and artifact. Though it was released in 1922, nanook seems like an afterimage of the cinema's prehistory and man's preconscious. The sharp whites and grays produced by Flaherty's orthochro- matic stock suggest a tonal morality play between Good and- not Evil- the Un- known. His uncanny knack for capturing on film the swirl patterns of soil and sea (the innocent eye was also a painterly one, worthy of Monet) can be traced to the palpable landscapes of nanook. And here, the ability of his camera to record texture but not temperature helps univer- salize his setting: the Arctic snowstorm looks like an Arabian sandstorm. Nanook is a Bedouin, and we are all Eskimos. Without Nanook himself, however, Flaherty's film might have been a turning point in world cinema, but it would not have been a popular success. From the moment nanook of the north opened at New York's Capitol Theatre (on a double bill with grandma's boy), Nanook was a star. He was also a remarkable natural actor. It's easy to imagine that at first Flaherty led Nanook and his family through showmanlike bits of business (as in our introduction to the six, when they emerge from their kayak, one by one, like so many midget clowns from a circus auto), and gradually learned to anticipate and trust his star, his subject, his collabo- rator, his friend, until the two became one- became the film. Nanook's austere exoticism presents a danger for the contemporary viewer. Because it seems hatched from some Ice Age time capsule, the film- as well as its protagonist and its director- can too eas- ily be classified as a "noble primitive" deserving of a civilized man's awe and condescension. What's missing from this overview is the respect for a craftsman that Nanook earns from Flaherty, and Flaherty from us. The sequence in which Nanook fits an ice window for his igloo stands as the collaborative fusion be- tween two men who respected crafts- manship as both a tool for survival and a fine art. And the film as a whole stands alone- not as a mausoleum of textbook cinema but as a memorial proclaiming the immortality of a noble, atavistic way of life. Before nanook, in the words of Arthur Calder-Marshall, Flaherty was "the son of a mining prospector" who "because he loved the North so much went back there to make a film." But from the mo- ment he accepted Jesse Lasky's offer of employment at Paramount, "Flaherty was a film director, an explorer in search of film subjects and the money to make them." Lasky's telegram, as quoted by Flaherty, exhorted him to "go off some- where and make me another nanook." But in most respects, moana is nanook's polar opposite: from the frozen sub-Arctic to the South Seas; from a family fighting the elements to stay alive, to a society so lacking in hardship that it must invent copyright © 1973 by Seeker and Warburg Ltd.</page><page sequence="3">Nanook. MOANA. a ritual of pain as the conduit to man- hood; from Flaherty as explorer-collabo- rator to Flaherty as filmmaker-observer; from nanook the film to moana the pro- duction. For anyone who has seen both films, the temptation to make moral judgments -about both Flaherty and his subject- is strong. Nanook is an emblem of primitive man at his courageous, pacific best; Moana, the nice-looking young Samoan, is an icon of the child-man at play, a prophecy of man in the automated future. There's also a temptation to blame the Samoans for an accident of geography that makes of their lives an eventless idyll, as opposed to Nanook's epic struggle. What can be said is that, without the bone-chilling conflict that a situation like Nanook's offers Flaherty- and without Flaherty's comradely commitment to a man rather than his contractual commit- ment to a studio- his films run the risk of degenerating into pretty pictures. Certainly moana is very pretty. Fla- herty's camera (making exquisite use of the new panchromatic stock) catches light glistening off the water, or off the Samoans' mocha-colored skin, with all the dappled silkiness of a William Daniels portrait of Garbo. But to say this is already to note a transition in Flaherty from artist to technician, and to suggest that, after making a masterpiece, Flaherty composed an étude. Though he films the native craft of tattooing with the same care he had shown toward Nanook's ice cutting, Flaherty's respect seems trivialized here: the craftsmanship is not elemental but ornamental- as is the film. Only at the end of moana does he come to grips with the static, undramatic quality of Samoan life, as the camera stoops and stops to con- template a lovely young boy, in a gaily colored bedspread, watched over by a loving mother- peace. But peace is not box office. Nor, more importantly, is it part of Flaherty's obsessive concern to hear his own voice above the ta-pocketa- pocketa of the Industrial Age. Ironically, Flaherty was now discovering that, to express this viewpoint on film, he must teach himself the mechanisms of the movie camera- and try to ingratiate him- self with the motion-picture industry. The story of moana is the record of Flaherty's attempt to learn these hard lessons. One mechanism Flaherty never could fathom was the movie mogul's mind. As the filmmaker's career progressed, his clout with the major distributors dimin- ished to the vanishing point; and, after nanook (a Pathé release) and moana (Paramount), the films he'd hoped would have universal appeal were seen largely by bureaucrats and buffs. The history of his 1926 experimental short, the twenty- four dollar island, is instructive. Subti- tled "a camera impression of New York," the film presents Manhattan as a sky- scraper ghost-town, with the spectral movements of tugboats on the East River recalling the entrance into Bremen of Nosferatu's chamal cargo- a sort of Styx and stone. Its temperament and tech- nique are hardly mainstream Flaherty, and its importance to him would seem to have been as a celluloid sketch-pad for some unspecified future project. But in light of his career's subsequent turn, the final disposition of the twenty-four dol- lar island is poignant and ominous: it was cut from two reels to one, and used as the backdrop for a stage show at the Roxy Theatre. In 1 926, John Grierson saw moana and called it a "documentary" film, thus bap- tizing a genre and investing Flaherty with its spiritual paternity. But it's really Grier- son who deserves to be called Father of the Documentary Film; Flaherty was more precisely its godfather (in the pre-Puzo sense). You can see the difference be- tween these two giants in a sequence from industrial Britain, a film Flaherty began in 1931 and left for Grierson to complete. Five years earlier, Flaherty had shot a crude fourteen-minute study, called the pottery maker, for the Metro- politan Museum. Now, in industrial Brit- ain, his camera homes in on the beautiful, clay-caked hands of a strapping young potter at work at the wheel. It is an image (like many from Flaherty's later films) of great formal and tonal beauty, and Fla- herty would certainly have let it speak, by itself, its admiration for yet another obsolescent skill. But Grierson's narrator must exclaim- and exhort- "Look at those hands!" If Flaherty would have us understand (in his own way, and in our own good time), Grierson would have us learn (and now, because tomorrow may be too late). And if the wild Irishman was both anthropologist and artist, the wily Scot was both sociologist and socialist. In its final form, therefore, industrial Britain celebrates individual craftsman- ship only to the extent that it can be bent toward communal consumption, if not mass production. Given this dialectic, it's odd that Fla- herty's next film, man of aran, should be criticized by some Griersonians as dra- matically sensational and socially irrele- vant. Flaherty had gone off to the Aran Islands and, instead of returning with a fulsome indictment of the absentee land- lordism responsible for Aran's poverty, he brought back a tale of dewy-eyed urchins and anachronistic sea monsters. Grier- son himself, in a "defense" of the film, put the argument gently but pointedly: "I like my braveries to emerge otherwise than from the sea, and stand otherwise than against the sky. I imagine they shine as bravely in the pursuit of Irish landlords as in the pursuit of Irish sharks." Here Grierson is skillfully indulging in a mode of attack he calls foolish earlier in his remarks: "to complain of a pear that it lacks the virtue of a pomegranate." The pear is the Flaherty documentary, which he created and which remained uniquely his own; the pomegranate is the Grierson documentary, the film of social realism, which man of aran never pre- tended to be. Flaherty's films were epic, not episodic; they were built around a hero, not around a cast of faceless prole- tarian thousands. (The land proves the great exception to both these rules.) As for the anachronism of the Aran Islanders 40 NOVEMBER 1973</page><page sequence="4">MAN OF ARAN. all photos: Museum of Modern Art /Film Stills Archive THE LAND. LOUISIANA STORY. hunting basking-sharks- which they had not done for fifty years- this was not a new device for Flaherty. He had dressed Nanook in more "genuine" Eskimo cos- tumes, and taught him a more pictur- esque method of catching seals. He had subjected Moana to the painful and un- necessary ordeal of tattooing, and indeed painted as a primitive paradise a Samoan island that had for years been wallowing in British Imperial corruption. But Fla- herty's concern was always for the truth, not facts: "One often has to distort a thing to catch its true spirit." Still, if man of aran should not be condemned for what it is not, it can be criticized for what it is. For the first time, we can see the lyrical naïveté of nanook solidifying into an attitude. We can follow Flaherty's eye as it wanders away from the people and toward the sea, away from individuals and toward archetypes. We can sense a conscious attempt on Fla- herty's part to create a pictorial style; and here, the chiaroscuro compositions (charcoal rock, black-clad figures against a gray sky) are light-years re- moved from the natural grandeur of nan- ook, the easy elegance of moana. We suspect that Flaherty's spiritual kinship with nature is in danger of degenerating into either adoration or exploitation; the spectacular shark-hunting and sea-fury scenes smack of (very) special effects. And for the first time, we dare to put impertinent questions to the characters in a Flaherty film: If life is so tough, why don't they move? It's a measure of man of aran's failure, by Flaherty standards, that the appropriate analogues are not other Flaherty films; for aran suggests nothing so much as a harpoon-gun wed- ding between the abstract immersion of Steiner's h2o and the narrative bathos of RYAN'S DAUGHTER. By the late Thirties, Flaherty was in trouble. Jobless, broke, and angry, he had just failed in his third try at collabo- rating with the commercial-film enemy (MGM and W.S. Van Dyke on white shad- ows of the south seas, F. W. Murnau on tabu, and finally Alexander Korda on elephant boy). Career ironies were be- coming unpleasant, and inevitable. With- in two years of nanook, Flaherty had gone to Hollywood and Nanook had gone back north to die of starvation; within a year of elephant boy, Sabu had gone to Hol- lywood and Flaherty was left in London, where he might have succumbed to the artistic death of stagnation if Pare Lorentz hadn't invited him back home, to make a movie for the U.S. Film Service. America was one country Flaherty had never really explored. Geographically and metaphysically, his life's itinerary had led him to primitive lands in search of timeless truths. On four continents, he had found patches of land- of subzero solemnity (nanook), tropical torpor FfLM COMMENT 41</page><page sequence="5">(MOANA), oceanic ferocity (man of aran), jungle impenetrability (elephant boy)- that Nature, in its setting of climate and character, seemed to be offering to Fla- herty as a ready-made metaphor. And each film had been a safari into the darkest memories of the race, an expedi- tion to capture on film the endangered species of living legends before they re- ceded irrevocably into myth. But now, in the America of 1939, his government sponsors had assigned him the task of resolving on film a horrifyingly tangled mass of contradictions and complexities. Why, at the tail end of the Great Depres- sion, were so many migrant workers out of work? How could they be (in Calder- Marshall's words) "near to starving in a land where farmers were being paid by the Government not to raise hogs"? Where had the Government failed its people? Flaherty's refusal to absolve the New Deal with a fast shuffle made the land a failure as propaganda (the film was effectively suppressed, and to some de- gree remains so today), but his will- ingness to explore the faces of America's dispossessed, without flinching or equiv- ocating, helped make it a great docu- ment. The film's very lack of cohesion reflects, in the splinters of a broken eco- nomic mirror, a human catastrophe too overwhelming to be shoehorned into the microcosm of a narrative scenario. In- stead of a single, simple vision, the land projects a series of eloquent images. A dozen men crowd around a foreman; one stays outside the group, sitting hopeless- ly. A dying cow, a dead house, dead-eyed children- all are still standing. Unem- ployed scarecrows of men stare into the camera; it seems they have all the time in the world to pose for film portraits that echo Dorothea Lange even as they prefig- ure Diane Arbus. An old Negro, obliv- ious to the camera, emerges from a rat- infested, death-corroded house, looks around, sees nothing, polishes and rings an old carillon, surveys the land again, says "Where they all gone?" and returns to his home, closing the door on his unseen voyeurs to converse at peace with his demons. A boy sleeps, his hands moving; his mother says, "He thinks he's picking peas"; she strokes his hair and the hands stop; as the scene fades out, the hands start moving again. The land is a film without heroes or villains- only victims. The closest Fla- herty comes to an éminence grise is the abstract shadow of mechanized farming, which turned farmers into foremen, and "farm hands" into exactly that: factory workers on an endless belt. And the clos- est he comes to an optimistic conclu- sion-if we discount, as we should, the apocalyptical prose announcing the ad- vent of "the ever-normal granary"- is his camera's infatuation with contour farm- ing. Flaherty had always delighted in swirls and eddies of snow (nanook), sea (MOANA, man of aran), and smoke (THE TWENTY-FOUR DOLLAR ISLAND). Here it's the soil. In long, graceful helicopter-shots, you can see his eye take in the rolling, man-made designs of earth, and feel his hand caress this huge, gorgeous, func- tional sculpture. It's appropriate that Flaherty should proclaim his independence from the state-sponsored documentary by finding this particular aesthetic solution to their pressing political problem. Certainly this is the only "solution" the land offers. After limning the beauty of this "pattern that will hold the soil," this "new design" (which, as Flaherty has shown in other films and other lands, is as old as the earth), he asks, "But what about the people?" It is an unanswered question. The land is Flaherty's belated attempt to come to terms with the twentieth century: a fragmented work on an insoluble puz- zle. Typical of its maker, a man with a magnetic sense for unpopular truths, the film dared to ask the one question no machine man could answer. At the end of the war, Flaherty recalled Helen van Dongen- the editorial mind behind his camera eye on the land, a collaborator who was really a co-author- into his service, and enlisted the young Ricky Leacock as cameraman, for a proj- ect commissioned by Standard Oil. This time, there was a story: of a half-wild boy whose exploration of the bayou fauna intersects with his discovery of Civiliza- tion in the guise of a Humble drilling team. At first suspicious of the men and their machines, the boy soon becomes friend- ly, and the film ends, suitably, with mutual economic and spiritual blessings. How- ever naïve or dissembling this scenario may sound in a time of controversy over oil spills, pipelines, and tax shelters, there's no doubting Flaherty's emotional and artistic commitment to this, his last film. For in Louisiana story we can read the artist's autobiography: the bayou boy is an icon of Young Bob, the adventurer and fantast; and the man who plays his father is a Flaherty lookalike and talkalike. (At the punch line of one of his stories, you can hear the film crew cracking up with laughter- and perhaps a sense of déjà vu.) Louisiana story marks the signing of Flaherty's détente with the machine. And his sympathetic treatment of the great oil derrick is a triumph of humanist anthropomorphism. Gliding through the luminous backwater, the derrick has the silent mystery and ponderous grace of some prehistoric monarch, an aristo- cratic relative of the area's alligators and water snakes; but once anchored, it will- ingly becomes man's servant, honored to have been domesticated in a worthy cause. (And when it leaves, the film tells us, it even cleans up after itself.) In the climactic explosion of the gusher, nature is tamed but not enslaved. As with man of aran and the land, Flaherty spotlights lone figures standing by impotently as nature whips itself across the screen; but here the force is benign, productive- and all because of man's ingenuity and craftsmanship. As nocturnal meditations on the machine, the land is a nightmare symphony, and Louisiana story is a dream play. Flaherty's features trace a line from actuality (nanook) to ideal (moana) to possibility (man of aran) to miracle (Loui- siana story). With each succeeding film the narrative becomes fuller and more clearly defined until, at last, Flaherty made a fiction film with real people. In its relaxed pace, rural genius loci , and subjective use of a child's viewpoint, Louisiana story recalls some of Clarence Brown's Forties work (national velvet, THE YEARLING, INTRUDER IN THE DUST). In- deed, Flaherty even indulges in a bit of Hollywood Darwinism, with his film's sur- vival of the nicest. One reason for the generally ecstatic response of Flaherty's longtime admirers to Louisiana story may have been their hope that its relative accessibility might suggest to the moguls that finally the old renegade could make a personal but salable film for them. If this was so, their hope was futile. Flaherty had no sustaining work between the completion of Louisiana story and his death three years later. There were really three Robert Fla- hertys: man, myth, and moviemaker. To judge the third, it would be helpful if we had never heard of the first two- if we could bring to the criticism of his films the same innocent eye that he brought to his film subjects. The enshrinement of the Flaherty myth, which has become a minor industry, clouds that vision. As a result, Flaherty's reputation is in danger of drowning in a swamp of hype and half-truths, when it could keep afloat, easily and gracefully, on its own. The man Js dead. The myth must die. The films will live.
