<plain_text><page sequence="1">Studies on the "Seven against Thebes" of Aeschylus. By H. D. CAMERON. ("Studies in Classical Literature," 8.) The Hague and Paris: Mouton, 1971. Pp. 108. This short work is the outgrowth of a Princeton dissertation (1962) that treated the imagery of the Seven. Imagery is the subject of its last three chapters, and since this is the freshest and most valuable part of the present work, I will treat it first. C. rightly assumes that where there are two forces, Argive and Theban, and two opponents, Polyneices and Eteocles, the poet will have used his verbal skill to discriminate the members of each pair. He also assumes, however, that the poet will have labeled one force and one man good, the other evil (p. 26), which explains at once why he cannot finally admire this tragedy or perceive the true complexity of its poetry. The question of right and wrong between the two brothers is settled in C.'s mind by his presumption (in spite of his own warnings that we must presume nothing outside the text, pp. 15-16) that Eteocles is the elder son, and by his further presumption (following Robert) that Aeschylus used the tradition of Hellanicus in his version of the brothers' quarrel. There is nothing in the play to show that Aeschylus attributed greater age to Eteocles, nor is there anything to indicate that he thought of Polyneices as having departed after receiving his due share of property by adjudication. On the contrary, Polyneices at 637 charges that his exile was unjust and enforced, and against the notion that this brother had willingly resigned his claim stand the opXov-i -' p'Xcov at 674, the /3carUAEortf at 764, and the plain statement at 1049: ITOcLOV KacKW'S KOCKO FUWV acV-r7/LEt3ETO. This last line, however, C. with most others rejects as belonging to a revised and non- Aeschylean ending. There is an "Excursus on Primogeniture" (pp. 56-57) that is meant to reinforce our belief in the unassailable rights of Eteocles, but the argument there put forth does not inspire much confidence. It seems to take its line entirely from Woodhouse's Solon the Liberator, while its twice-repeated misspelling of the name Fustel de Coulanges betrays a lack of close familiarity with that author (cf. the misspelling of "Literaturgeschichte" on p. 33, n. 7, and of "von Erffa" on p. 44, n. 33). Speculation about actual seventh-century Athenian practice in the division of private property does not necessarily or even prob- ably lead to certainty about mythic Theban practice in the division of royal power. On the contrary, the many mythic pairs of quar- reling regal brothers would seem to prove</page><page sequence="2">290 BOOK REVIEWS that primogeniture was not the necessary formula imagined for the fabulous states of the past. C.'s belief that there is a sharp and un- troubled distinction between just Thebans and unjust Argives in the Seven has a stultifying effect upon his treatment of the poetry of the play. Thinking perhaps that the most obvious images, the shield devices, have been more than adequately discussed (but have they ?), C. leaves the diversified heraldry of the paired warriors alone and looks instead for a single, more general pair of images. These he finds in the notions of the ship and the horse, two germinal sources of imagery which, he believes, contain the poet's central instruction about the attack and the defense of Thebes. However, because of his first assumption that a clash between right and wrong is the subject of the play, he listens to the sounds of storm and hoof not with his ear so much as with a mind that would translate poetry if it could into didactic prose. C. is convinced that Eteocles is proposed by the poet as a general who takes an erroneous tactical decision, a tragic hero whose hamartia is a piece of military mis- calculation. Instead of keeping to a proper position in central headquarters, he decides to abandon his post and go foolishly off as a warrior (p. 35), and this is the cause of his downfall. C. cannot show that the mythical king of a beleaguered city traditionally remained inactive, but he asserts as much, and then criticizes Aeschylus for making his king break with this "tradition" without any overt motive (p. 35)! He might have profited from Rose, who observes: "A king of the Heroic Age, unless he was old, as Adrastos seems to be, could hardly absent himself from battle" (A Commentary on the Surviving Plays of Aeschylus, I, 192). Or he might, were he not so eager to reject the final lines, at least have considered 1011, with its -rE'OVrqKEV OVfTEpr ToS VEOtS OmVUKEWV KcAOV. Because of his preconception about Eteo- cles' flawed generalship, C. considers the play's ship imagery as in itself inconsequen- tial, a mere verbal backdrop for the figure of a captain who abandons his post in the stern to flee to the prow (p. 59). Why the center of the acropolis should be identified with the rear deck of a storm-tossed merchant ship we are not told, nor does C. explain why taking an aggressive stance at one of the gates is the equivalent of a cowardly retreat to the safer prow. The lines he is building on, 208-209, overtly equate the chorus, in its disorderly rush from private into public places, with a sailor who runs senselessly from poop to prow in a storm. In other words, the overt place equation is between acropolis and prow! Much of the emphasis upon steering is C.'s anyway, for there is no language explicitly describing this process after the OlaKOc-rpO&amp;OS, at 63 (and before this only O'LaKa VW[t6V in line 3). At 282 Eteocles is merely an oarsman, a fact that C. admits, in a footnote (p. 59, n. 2), but does not account for. An attempt is made to establish the notion of the abandoned helm by rendering Eteocles' 'rw O KCa-' oVYpov in 690 as "let the race ... drift adown (sic) wind" (p. 67), but this stratagem only betrays the weakness of the case. There is no sense of loss of control in the phrase the king uses here, where the essential notions are speed and divine impulse. At 853, where another imaginary ship moves KCa-i' oVpov, it is certainly not drifting but explicitly propelled by oars, and one might refer as well to Bacchylides 16 (17). 87 and to Jebb's note ad loc. There the command is given to the kybernetes to hold the ship on its course KiCar OVlpov. In the end C.'s nautical chapter, with its emphasis upon words connected with keeping a vessel watertight (pp. 62-63), actually weakens the contention that Eteocles was wrong to assign himself to a gate, while it strengthens our contrary impression that the right place for the king was at one of the city's possible breach-points. For example, the discussion of ships and water ends with an excursus on ancient irrigation. Here C. supposes (p. 72) that something in Strabo 17. 1. 37 suggests that Egyptian sluice gates were double-leaved and opened like doors. The geographer does not hint at any such arrangement, but the point is of no importance anyway. C. would support Tucker's sugges-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 291 tion that there is irrigation imagery at 544, and this observation does not stand or fall with the question of whether or not a sluice gate could be called a pylos. A sluice gate did not open as a city gate did, but it is nonethe- less true that the "liquid tongue" that might, according to Eteocles, seep into Thebes and there nurture evils and make them grow is figured as an irrigation stream. (C. might have noted Rose's reading at 86 and his explanation: "The flooded river carries away the boundary marks, dykes and so forth, of the land on its banks," op. cit., p. 170.) Certainly Aeschylus asks us to think of the fifth gate as a weak spot in an earthen dike, one that needs extra reinforcement, and if this is so with the fifth, why not with the seventh? The likening of the attacking Argive enemy to an element that can be controlled and made beneficial by an exertion of techne should not have been left without comment, but first among the effects of the metaphor is its suggestion that Eteocles, like a good farmer, should be in control of his irrigation system and on the spot where dikes are threatened. The image of baneful and insinuating moisture, the "liquid tongue," is followed (though C. does not note this fact, since juxtapositions and shield devices do not interest him) by the image of a beast, the sphinx of Parthenopaeus, that would enter the city. The full effect of the series of lines is to make of Thebes a fenced vineyard or field, a cultivated spot in the middle of the wilds, a place that must be kept from en- croaching beasts and floods. This glance at a well-watered and flourishing natural evil is strongly reminiscent of some of the imagery of the Agamemnon, and it suggests here as there that, when the demonic is unappeased, nature may revert to a primal enormity and fertility itself become sinister. The notion of the pollution or inversion of nature is also suggested by some of the images that C. treats in his sixth chapter, but he never undertakes a serious investigation of all the images of growing things in the Seven. Turning to C.'s treatment of the horse imagery we find an even less satisfactory performance. When Aeschylus evokes the snorting of horses or the clangor of their trappings in the Seven, he is obviously doing something very different from his summoning up of wind and wave. There are physical horses just outside the gates, lending empiri- cal force to the language of bridle and rein, but undermining the fantastic quality that such words might otherwise have had. C. never stops to consider the literal nature of his equine category; in fact, he never stops to tell us what he really means by imagery, and he does not try to distinguish among the various means a poet may use, much less among the purposes he may have, when he forces some particular sensual attribute upon a naked concept. A horse is mastered and controlled, and C. believes that the Argives are peculiarly identified with their horses because they wish to tame and ride the city of Thebes. This involves him in an attempt to show that the city, too, partakes of the hippic (p. 82), and it leads to a curious problem: where all are horses, who shall ride? C. thinks the answer is sexual; because Tydeus, at 392, is said to be ,tacX$ Epc3v, he tells us that the enemy is snorting with "lusty appetite" just outside the gates (p. 81). By such means he arrives at a vision of the city's fall as a panorama of copulating animals, though what this does to the eros that drives Eteocles toward his brother at 688 I hesitate to think. The demonstration (pp. 81 ff.) of the horsi- ness of the chorus is in every sense un- chivalrous. It never carries conviction, since it depends upon only two words, the tii78Ov at 328, which describes the fashion in which a girl might be seized, as if by a mane, and the 7TWCAKC6V at 454, which modifies (E;CwAiCwv to specify the sleeping rooms of the unmarried girls. The first phrase is unusual but the second is not, and together they hardly constitute a heavy hoof-print upon the listening imagination. (This is particularly the case since the women are simultaneously imaged in other ways as well, as just-ripe fruit at 333, or as small game, with the pK0CV0a of 346; see Rose, ad toC.) C. would show that the women's fear of rape is a fear of bestial</page><page sequence="4">292 BOOK REVIEWS intercourse, but here he far outdistances his poet. The passage at 363-69 describes an irreproachably anthropomorphic sexual act with such noble reticence (VV'KTEpOV T-,os-) that not even Emily Post would have frowned; nevertheless it inspires C. to say: "The Argives as lustful stallions will cover the frightened mares" (p. 82). And this although his own next sentence makes reference to a line where the imaginary rapist is at work not with hoof but with hand (KEXELPWILE'VCCS-, 326). C. goes so far as to persuade himself that the Sopt of line 456 belongs to his argument, but even with a mind quite open to the potential phallic projection of an Argive spear, I find it hard to see how this weapon helps the "image of the lustful stallion" to "reach its climax," as we are assured that it does on page 83. The isolation of ship and horse and the neglect of other sorts of imagery were presumably meant to serve a cleanly simple interpretation of the Seven, but here again we are disappointed. Both images embody the motif of "control" according to their investigator (p. 76), but what the play finally says about the defeat of a controlled group of horse by a ship that is, by C.'s argument, out of control, the author does not explain. He has, as a matter of fact, returned to Wilamowitz' Zweistoffen, ridding himself of the need to make real sense of the play by denying its unity. The defense of the city is a secondary theme unrelated to and ill-com- bined with the major theme of the fate of the Labdacids-such is the claim. Presumably this means that the "system" of imagery need not serve the Argive-Theban tale, but, even if that were the case, all the more would we expect it to serve the story of the mutual slaughter of the sons of Oedipus. And where is the illumination, if we look upon their deaths as the interlocking destruction of a knight who is the master of his horse and a captain who is not the master of his ship? Far more rewarding is C.'s last and briefest chapter, in which he tries to show that the mutual slaughter of the Spartoi provides a third major image group for the Seven. He is not able to point to a single imagistic passage which indisputably holds a reference to the sons of the dragon's teeth (most of the images investigated are in fact simply those of vegetable growth- and blight), but he does at least here abandon his presentation of a simply righteous Eteocles and a simply criminal Polyneices. He does not treat the brothers as equals, but he does show them to be both true Spartoi and both true sons of Oedipus, men who, having cast off their father, now violate their mother, the Theban soil that had brought forth the Sown Men. (It should be noted that this idea appeared first, in a less developed form, in Patzer's article in HSCP, LXIII [1958], 108.) It is C.'s conclusion that the Seven is a deeply flawed play held together primarily by the fragile web of its imagery, for he reads a play that falls into three parts. The last, beginning at 1010, is spurious, and the first two, dividing at 653, are seriously at odds with one another (p. 96). His book begins with a review of the structure and the fictional content of the tragedy, and here he pretends to uncover contradictions in the characters of Eteocles and the chorus, contradictions in the themes of the tragedy, and contradic- tions even in the purposes of the piece. The discussion in these initial chapters is repeti- tious (one sometimes comes upon an identical phrase reused: compare n. 25, p. 25, with n. 4, p. 32), and for the most part it is a pastiche of the opinions of others. With Von Fritz, C. is scornful of the Opfertod reading; with Golden and Podlecki he seeks for a drama of char- acter; with Wolff he discusses (rather con- fusedly) the problem of the timing of the gate assignments; but his greatest debt is to the already cited article by Patzer. As a rule, however, the subtleties of these scholars have been suppressed as C., with his righteous hero whose hamartia is a tactical blunder, al- most succeeds in obscuring the achievements of those whose work he would build upon. Sometimes a certain carelessness is betrayed as the conclusions of others are reported, and it must be noted that, though note 18 on page 39 suggests that Wilamowitz and Fraenkel held that the Theban captains were assigned before the second episode, this is not the case.</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 293 Again on the same page, note 20 speaks of "Wolff's solution. .. that Eteocles was inter- rupted," when this is precisely the idea that Wolff argued against. (The "solution" might be more correctly attributed to Lesky, WS, LXXIV [1961], 8, though Wilamowitz, Groeneboom, and Italie had all discussed it as a possibility.) Errors such as these, which would mar even an original argument, are almost fatal in what is essentially a report of the state of the question. ANNE BURNETT University of Chicago</page></plain_text>
