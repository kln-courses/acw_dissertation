<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mephistopheles as an Aristophanic Devil Ida H. Washington Goethe's description of the sealed final version of Faust II as "ernste Scherze"' has teased generations of scholars with the enig- matic implications of the oxymoron "serious jests." The expression also placed Goethe in the long, but relatively neglected, literary tradition of serious humor. It was singularly appropriate that Goethe first used the phrase in a letter to Sulpiz Boisseree, because the long friendship between the aging poet and his much younger admirer had in itself a para- doxical quality. Boissere'e, a collector of medieval art works, was a close friend of leading romanticists, and the development of his friendship with Goethe had involved a modification of extreme views on both sides. As Goethe wrote to Boisseree on June 16, 1826: Wie merkwurdig und selten ist es, daB zwei Personen, von so verschie- denen Lebenspunkten ausgehend, doch immer wieder ... sich im In- nersten aller Hauptpunkte ubereinstimmend finden, wenn die Peri- pherie der Zustande und Gesinnungen ihnen auch zunachst auf geson- derte Wege hindeutet. Recent critics have noted that the label "ernste Scherze" is also I Goethe used this phrase twice in the last few months of his life: first as "diese ernst gemeinten Scherze" on November 24, 1831, in a letter to Sulpiz Boisser&amp;e; then, in his last preserved letter, written to Wilhelm von Humboldt on March 17, 1832, as "diese sehr ernsten Scherze."</page><page sequence="2">660 IDA H. WASHINGTON uniquely appropriate to Faust,2 a work which combines the heri- tage of the medieval Faust legend with elements from classical Greece in ways that often involve jests with serious implications. Nowhere in the drama do these classical and medieval elements unite with more paradoxical effect than in the figure of Mephis- topheles, who is clearly no longer the devil of the fifteenth century chapbook, but fits no better into traditional classical concepts. One of the first to notice a confusion in the character of Mephis- topheles was Friedrich Schiller, who wrote to Goethe on June 26, 1797: In Rucksicht auf die Behandlung finde ich die groBe Schwierigkeit, zwischen dem SpaB und dem Ernst glucklich durchzukommen, Ver- stand und Vernunft scheinen mir in diesem Stoff auf Tod und Leben miteinander zu ringen.... Der Teufel behalt durch seinen Realismus vor dem Verstand, und der Faust vor dem Herzen recht. Zuweilen aber scheinen sie ihre Rollen zu tauschen. Eine Schwierigkeit finde ich auch darin, daB der Teufel durch seinen Charakter, der realistisch ist, seine Existenz, die idealistisch ist, aufhebt. Die Vernunft nur kann ihn [sic] glauben, und der Verstand nur kann ihn so, wie er da ist, gelten lassen und begreifen. At the time Goethe dismissed Schiller's objections to the confusion of jest (Scherz) and seriousness (Ernst) with the casual comment (June 27, 1797): "Ich werde sorgen, daB die Teile anmutig und unterhaltend sind und etwas zu denken lassen." However, it is in- teresting to speculate whether some memory of the discussion might have surfaced thirty-five years later in the phrase "diese sehr ernsten Scherze." Another early critic who noticed the changes in Mephistopheles was Mme. de Stael, who wrQte after the first part of Faust had been published: The Devil is the hero of the piece; the author has not conceived him like a hideous phantom, such as he is usually presented to children; he has made him, if we may so express ourselves, the evil Being "par excel- lence." . . . Goethe wished to display in this character, at once real and fanciful, the bitterest pleasantry that contempt can inspire, and at the same time an audacious gaiety that amuses. There is an infernal irony in the discourses of Mephistopheles, which extends itself to the whole 2 Cf., in particular, Herman Meyer, Diese sehr ernsten Scherze (Heidelberg: Lothar Stiehm Verlag, 1970), and Harold Jantz, The Form of Faust (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1978).</page><page sequence="3">M L N 661 creation, and criticizes the universe like a bad book of which the Devil has made himself the censor. Mephistopheles makes sport with genius itself, as with the most ridiculous of all absurdities, when it leads men to take a serious interest in any thing that exists in the world, and above all when it gives them confidence in their own individual strength.... The Mephistopheles of Goethe is a civilized Devil. He handles with dexterity that ridicule, so trifling in appearance, which is nevertheless often found to consist with a profundity of malice ... The character of Mephistopheles supposes an inexhaustible knowledge of social life, of nature, and of the marvelous.3 The qualities which Mme. de Stael associates with Mephis- topheles are those found in discussions of the dramas of Aris- tophanes: Audacious gaiety, irony, dexterity in ridicule of absur- dities, a civilized tone, and inexhaustible knowledge of social life, nature and the marvelous.4 It should have been only a short step from this enumeration to the recognition of Mephistopheles as a literary descendant of Greek comedy. Early criticism, however, seems to have been primarily interested in Goethe's drama as the most recent addition to the long progression of literary works based on the sixteenth century Faust legend, and hence were not concerned with a search for other sources. For modern critics a further barrier to the recognition of Aristophanic elements was laid across their path by Nietzsche's neat dichotomy of the Greek cultural scene into "Apollonisch" and "Dionysisch" in his essay Die Geburt der Tragidie aus dem Geiste der Musik (1872). According to this division, Winckelmann's perception of the essence of Greek art as "edle Einfalt und stille GroBe" stands on the one hand, re- flected in literary works by Goethe and Schiller, while on the other is the emotionalism of the dionysian festivals of ancient Greece, perpetuated most effectively in Holderlin's verse and lyric prose. The flaw in this bipartite division is that it rests on a tripartite base in the ancient world. To the "Bild" of the Apollonian and the "Musik" of the Dionysian should be added the "Wort" of the Aris- tophanic. Words are, after all, the essential third element of a "Ge- samtkunstwerk." In the drama of ancient Greece, words found their most varied and flexible use in Old Comedy, a form which survives today only in eleven plays by Aristophanes. The omission of comedy from Nietzsche's outline of the Greek 3 Germaine de Stae1, On Germany (London: John Murray, 1814), Vol. II, 181-85. 4 Cf., e. g., Gilbert Murray, Aristophanes, a Study (New York: Oxford University Press, 1933).</page><page sequence="4">662 IDA H. WASHINGTON legacy is perhaps not to be wondered at, for even in ancient times comedy was the last and least recognized part of the dionysian fes- tivals. The Greek celebrations in honor of Dionysos were made up of three main components: the wildly emotional procession cul- minating in the choral dithyrambs, the tragic plays, and the come- dies. Official acceptance of comedy came late and, even with gov- ernment support, comedy continued to take a second place to tragic drama. Only a single comedy was presented in the afternoon of each of the three festival days, after the morning had been filled with a tragic tetralogy. Comedy was thus for the Athenians a subset of the dionysian, or emotional, side of art, a form which supplied an opportunity for relief of pent-up feelings by laughter at the performance of others, a substitution for personal engage- ment in excesses. In this setting Aristophanes stood alone as a dramatist who used comedy for serious social criticism.5 Our fragmentary information about the fifth century B.C. indicates that comedy before Aris- tophanes consisted in wild buffoonery, and after him in Men- ander's light situation comedies. Only in works of Aristophanes does Greek comedy achieve what scholars have called "a kinship with tragedy,"6 "something artistic, intellectual, public-spirited, and genuinely brilliant,"7 which carried the social message of "an exponent of peace and rational politics."8 Even Nietzsche, who largely ignored Aristophanes, referred in an aside to his "tiefen Instinkte."9 The combination of- serious intent with comic vehicle is one of the favorite weapons of satire, which works for reform by making imperfect persons and conditions ridiculous. In ancient Greece, as in modern Europe, there were poets who undertook the task of serious reform, but undertook it seriously. There were others who wore the cap and bells of the jester and helped their contempo- raries relax from the stresses of the day with foolish merriment. Aristophanes, however, discovered that it is possible to teach and preach through laughter, and the boisterous results of his dis- 5 Since no complete comedy by any other early Greek dramatist has survived, this estimate is necessarily made on the basis of complete works of Aristophanes and only fragments by his contemporaries. 6 Edith Hamilton, The Greek Way (New York: W.

There is no indication that Aristophanes was surrounded by a group of admiring disciples in his own time. Old Comedy was sup- planted by New Comedy while Aristophanes lived, and his final plays even participate in this transition. His work therefore had to wait for rediscovery, when his type of ironic satire could be revived in later eras. One of the first important admirers and imitators of Aris- tophanes was the second century Greek satirist Lucian of Samo- sata, who transplanted the Aristophanic spirit from the stage to a dialogue intended for reading. Dubbed "earnest in his laughter" by the historian Eunapius,'I Lucian is best known as the originator of the humorous satirical dialogue, where witty attacks on men, gods, and current social problems are often set outside the tem- poral world. The dialogues of Lucian became popular in northern Europe through the Latin translations of Erasmus, and were brought directly into Germany by Wieland, whose German version of Lucian's works appeared in 1788 and 1789. The Aristophanic type of serious literary jest was thus available to Goethe, both in the plays of Aristophanes, which we know Goethe read in translation at least in 1777 and 1820, and in the works of Lucian, which were published in German during one of the important creative periods in Goethe's work on the Faust drama. In Faust the Aristophanic spirit appears most clearly in the words and actions of Mephistopheles. If Faust himself is a "Renais- sance man," as Harold Jantz has convincingly argued," then Mephistopheles is an Aristophanic devil, bringing to the German literary scene from the classical world a verbally witty component that carries the means for serious jesting. The verbal aspect of the character of Mephistopheles forms an important distinction between Goethe's devil and his medieval an- cestor. Die Historia von Doktor Johann Fausten is amusing reading, but the humor lies not in what is said by the characters, but in what is done with their supernatural powers. There is nothing hu- morous in the pronouncements of the original Mephistopheles, whose orientation is entirely metaphysical. He performs those 10 Greek and Latin Literature, a Comparative Study, ed.

WASHINGTON tasks which he has contracted to do in exchange for eventual pos- session of Faust's soul, and departs with that soul at the conclusion of the narrative. His attention is never drawn away from his pri- mary objective, and he makes no peripheral comments on the gen- eral human scene. Goethe's Mephistopheles is, in contrast, anthropomorphic psy- chologically as well as physically, a thoroughly worldly participant in the activities of the drama. From the earlier literary incarnation he has brought with him his name and his supernatural powers, but even these powers are severely limited in his dealings with Faust. First, they are curtailed by the Lord, who insists in discussion with Mephistopheles that Faust will win eventual salvation. The form of the pact, a wager rather than a firm commitment, further defines parameters within which the devil must work. Finally, Goethe has made his Mephistopheles a northern, German devil, who cannot even conjure Helen up from the ancient world until Faust has brought back from the Mothers the means of recall. In the subsequent visit to Hades with Faust and Homunculus, Meph- istopheles is a tourist in a foreign land, very humanly interested in the strange creatures he meets there, and even a little homesick for his distant Blocksberg. In his anthropomorphic limitations, the Goethean Mephis- topheles is fully in the tradition of Aristophanes, in whose works supernatural beings also appear, speaking and acting much as or- dinary mortals do. In The Birds, for example, the divine visitors to Cloudcuckooland, Iris, Prometheus, and the peace delegation from Olympos, all behave and talk like human beings and are even bested in argument by Pisthetairos, a mortal decked out in feathers like a bird, who subsequently makes a triumphant visit to the home of the gods. The same easy communication between supernatural and tem- poral realms is seen in Faust, where Mephistopheles first appears in a prologue, paying a visit to Heaven, his former residence, and to the Lord. The existence of the traditional Heaven is not really called into question here, but traditional respect for it is absent in the flippant attitude of Mephistopheles and in the impudence of such lines as his exit comment: "Es ist gar hubsch von einem groBen Herrn,/ So menschlich mit dem Teufel selbst zu sprechen." (352-353) Both Aristophanes and Goethe lived in periods when the hold of the old religion on the people was weakening, and many intellec- tuals held the agnostic position of free thinkers. Their witty ma-</page><page sequence="7">M L N 665 nioulation of inherited dogmas reflects an unrestrained mental freedom difficult to tie down to specifics. The question raised by John Williams White about Aristophanes could be applied in the Mephistophelean context with equal pertinence to Goethe: "Who can affirm with confidence that he has penetrated the comic mask of Aristophanes and knows his beliefs? The poet's mocking irony baffles and perplexes his reader at almost every turn."12 If Mephistopheles is irreverent in his dealings with the divine, he is even less respectful in his treatment of men. Before he leaves Heaven to return to lower regions, he looks down from that supe- rior vantage point to comment on man as a creature of unfulfilled ambitions, jumping like a cricket in a vain attempt to fly: "Wie eine der langbeinigen Cicaden,/ Die immer fliegt und fliegend springt" (288-289). In the same setting, Mephistopheles speaks of his preference for live rather than dead victims and by implication compares man to a rodent: "Mir geht es wie die Katze mit der Maus" (322). Such entomological and zoological similes, used for humorous and symbolical effect, are not foreign to Aristophanes and even appear in the titles of The Wasps and The Birds. A more closely re- lated comparison of man to an insect is seen, however, in a dia- logue by Lucian entitled "Hermotimus." Here the student of phi- losophy Hermotimus describes his studies in terms of a mountain to be scaled. Those who successfully achieve the summit will look down and "sehen von der Hohe wo sie sich befinden, die ubrigen Menschen fur eben so viele Ameisen an." His friend Lycinus sharpens the effect of this simile by his objections to it: "BehUte Gott! zu was fur winzigen Thierchen machst du uns, Hermotimus! Ich wollte es gelten lassen, wenn du uns noch fur Pygmaen ange- sehen hattest; aber uns so am Boden, so ganz und gar auf der bloBen Haut der Mutter Erde herumkriechen zu machen, ist auch gar zu arg! "13 The quality which makes the dramas of Aristophanes vivid more than a score of centuries after they were written is the same "earthiness" that provides the vital energy of the Goethean Meph- istopheles. This spirit of "robust men who can roar with laughter at any kind of slapstick, decent or indecent, but chiefly the last,"'14 12 John Williams White, General Introduction to the Loeb Classical Library edi- tion of Aristophanes, Vol. I (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1938), ix. 13 Lucian von Samosata, Sdmtliche Werke, trans.

WASHINGTON reflects one facet of the sometimes unwillingly restrained spirit of the author of Faust. Two aspects of earthiness, amply evident in Mephistopheles,, as they were on the Aristophanic stage and in Lu- cian's dialogues, are vulgarity and a distrust of the philosophical and speculative. Sometimes these are combined, as in Aris- tophanes' Clouds, where Socrates and his "Thinkery" are the butt of an extended bawdy attack, or in the Walpurgisnacht scene of Faust, where Goethe mocks the established societal powers and dubs his literary adversary Nicolai a "Proktophantasmist" (4158). Those who theorize instead of acting are repeatedly attacked by Mephistopheles, as they are in the plays of Aristophanes. In the pact scene, Mephistopheles compares the man who indulges in philosophical speculation to an animal who misses the greenest fields: Ich sag' es dir: ein Kerl, der spekuliert, Ist wie ein Tier, auf durrer Heide Von einem bosen Geist im Kreis herum geftihrt, Und rings umher liegt schone grune Weide. (1830-1833) In the immediately following scene with a student, the philo- sophical, legal, and theological faculties of the university are all satirized by Mephistopheles, who sums up his advice: "Grau, theurer Freund, ist alle Theorie,! Und grun des Lebens goldner Baum" (2308-2039). The attack is continued in Faust II, where Goethe uses the familiar satiric device of comic contrast to sharpen its effect. In an exchange worthy of Aristophanes, Mephistopheles asks Wagner, who has just announced the creation of the first test- tube human being: "Und welch verliebtes Paar/ Habt ihr in's Rauchloch eingeschlossen? to which the pedant answers with mar- velous obtuseness: "Behute Gott! wie sonst das Zeugen Mode war/ Erklaren wir fur eitel Possen" (6836-6839). The robust vulgarity which has interfered with appreciation of the literary value of the works of Aristophanes and Lucian in more restrained eras has also given some critics problems with the figure of Mephistopheles. In the case of Mephistopheles, however, his satanic provenience has provided a morally useful excuse for his improprieties. These range from the blatantly lewd, often indi- cated by initial letters and dashes (as in lines 1821, 4133-4, and 4142-3) to subtly suggestive and sometimes very clever allusions, as in the report to Martha of her husband's untimely death (2925- 2984).</page><page sequence="9">M L N 667 Not only the words, but the actions of Mephistopheles as well recall scenes from Greek comedy. In his pursuit of the witches of the Blocksberg in Faust I and of the Lamian witches on the Pharsa- lian fields of Faust II, he reminds one of the incident with the flute-girl in the Wasps. In his assumption of disguises, he is perpet- uating a favorite Aristophanic device. Two of the disguises assumed by Mephistopheles deserve special mention in this context. During the carnival scene at the emperor's court, a natural setting for disguise, Mephistopheles appears as the spirit of avarice, accompanying Faust who is costumed as Plutus, the god of wealth. This is a reversal of the situation in Plutus, the last extant play by Aristophanes, where the god of wealth himself appears in disguise. The underlying purpose of exposing and mocking the prevalent human weakness of greed is, however, the same. Mephistopheles takes another disguise with strong classical asso- ciations from the hideous sisters, the Phorkyads. He meets the trio immediately after complaining of difficulty in feeling at home or accepted in Hades. By becoming Phorkyas, the Germanic devil is hellenized and is enabled to move freely among the inhabitants of the classical world. In taking on this new persona, the assumption of woman's dress draws but passing mention from Mephistopheles (8029). Transvestite disguise is a favorite device of Aristophanes, however, and forms a basic element in the plot of the Thesmophor- iazusae, where Mnesilochus dresses as a woman in order to attend the secret council meeting of the women and defend Euripides against their attacks. Still dressed as Phorkyas, Mephistopheles accompanies Faust and Helena back to the medieval world, and there he exhibits a more rarely mentioned Aristophanic quality, lyric beauty in his lines. Accompanying the birth of Euphorion, Phorkyas (Mephis- topheles) speaks the musical passage: Horet allerliebste Klange, Macht euch schnell von Fabeln frei, Eurer Gotter alt Gemenge LaBt es hin, es ist vorbei.... (9679 ff.) These words are in such contrast to both the satanic nature of Mephistopheles and to his assumed personality Phorkyas, that they evoke from the Chorus the comment, which begins: "Bist du, furchterliches Wesen,! Diesem Schmeichelton geneigt,... (9687</page><page sequence="10">668 IDA H. WASHINGTON ff.). Scholars have found it necessary to comment on this change of tone, justifying it as part of a planned Euphorion opera,'5 or echoing Schiller's comment on the confusion of Faust and Mephis- topheles. 16 There is one other significant passage where Mephistopheles again exhibits a softer side of his nature. This is in his final appear- ance, where he falls victim to the charms of the descending angels, and gives vent to his feelings in the lines beginning: "Mir brennt der Kopf, das Herz, . . ." (11753 ff.). Such interludes of lyric contrast are entirely in keeping with the style of Aristophanes, who showed that even the mocker can be moved to speak in beautiful lyrics like those of the entering Cloud chorus: Rise and soar eternal Clouds! Lift your loveliness of rain, in sodden splendor come! Soar from ocean's sullen swell, rise higher to the peaks, to the tall cliffs and trees! Rise and soar, while far below, earth and shining harvest lie, ... 17 One may debate whether the inclusion of these lyrics is an artistic flaw in the works of Aristophanes and Goethe, or whether such passages of honest feeling are inserted as relief from the prevailing mockery, much as Shakespeare introduced scenes of comic relief into his tragedies. As the means employed were similar, so the objects of attack by Aristophanes and by Goethe through Mephistopheles were much the same. Sham of all kinds, greed, lust, the substitution of talk and theory for action, all were serious objects of directed jest in ancient Athens and in Goethe's Weimar. It is impossible to imagine a Faust without Mephistopheles, for it is primarily through the de- velopment of this character that Goethe created, as he promised 15 Cyrus Hamlin, Interpretive Notes to Faust (New York: W.

When we realize that Mephistopheles is essentially an Aris- tophanic devil, then the classical period of German literature be- comes truly classical, for to the legacy of Winckelmann and the spirit of Dionysos is added the wit of Aristophanes.
