<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Caribs of St. Vincent and Indigenous Resistance during the Age of Revolutions JULIE CHUN KIM Fordham University abstract Although recent scholarship on the Haitian Revolution has emphasized the centrality of African actors in fomenting change in the Atlantic world, the roles that indigenous peoples played during the Age of Revolutions have largely been ignored. This essay counteracts this neglect by examining the history of the Caribs of St. Vincent, whose par ticipation in the Second Carib War (1795-96) posed a serious threat to British rule in the Caribbean. The Caribs of St. Vincent are more com monly known as the Black Caribs, a moniker used by British chroniclers to downplay the Caribs' aboriginal status and territorial claims to St. Vin cent. Yet Amerindians had first inhabited St. Vincent during the precolo nial era and hence well before Britain claimed possession of the island in 1763. Furthermore, they turned the island into a "Carib Republic," or refuge from imperial control, by incorporating runaway Africans, many of whom came from nearby British colonies, into their numbers. They also formed alliances with the governments of neighboring French colonies, which aided them during the Second Carib War. Although the British ultimately won the war, it nevertheless represents a unique attempt by a multiracial, Amerindian-led force to take advantage of revolutionary tur moil and maintain their territorial autonomy. Where is the Frenchman who -will not join his brothers, at a moment when the voice of liberty is heard by them? Let us I owe my thanks to Robb K.

Joseph Chatoyer, March 12, 1795 As revolutions consumed France and Haiti, a war broke out on St. Vincent between the island's indigenous inhabitants and its British occupiers. Brit ish settlers had been living on St. Vincent, a small island in the eastern Caribbean or Lesser Antilles, since approximately 1763. In that year, as part of the peace treaty concluding the Seven Years' War, France finally agreed to cede any territorial rights to the island, the possession of which had been contested by different European parties throughout the early colonial period. Even as Britain gained France's formal acknowledgment of its claims, however, it did not obtain the consent of the thousands of Caribs also inhabiting St. Vincent. The Caribs of St. Vincent could trace their ancestors in the region back to the precolonial era. Moreover, they had resisted attempts by outsiders to impose imperial sovereignty on them for centuries. This resistance caused the Spanish to designate them as Carib or hostile in the first place. The Caribs of St. Vincent also fought French and British attempts to settle the island and put up especially fierce challenges to British rule after 1763. Most notably, they engaged in two conflicts now known as the First and Second Carib Wars (1772-73, 1795-96). The Sec ond Carib War was especially important, as it represented the final attempt by the Caribs of St. Vincent to maintain possession of their island.1 At the same time that the Caribs of St. Vincent used the Second Carib War to pursue a long-standing agenda of territorial autonomy, they proved 1.

In particular, as they heard of revolutionary conflicts in the 1790s, they picked up on the language of fraternity, equality, and liberty to convince potential allies to join them in their fight against the British. These allies included a group of French planters who had been granted permission by the British government to remain on St. Vincent after 1763. Circulating a proclamation in French, the Carib leader Joseph Chatoyer called on its readers to hear "the voice of liberty" and "join" in the Carib cause. Chatoyer also figured the French planters and Caribs as fellow "citizens and brothers" working toward a common goal of freedom. In case this appeal to radical sentiment did not work, Chatoyer focused in the sec ond half of his proclamation on the consequences of nonparticipation. These consequences would include the execution as "traitors" of any Frenchmen reluctant to join the Caribs; Chatoyer additionally threatened to "burn their estates" and "murder their wives and children, in order to annihilate their race." The proclamation then ends with Chatoyer's personal mark, which stands in lieu of a signature and can be read as a further decla ration of difference (figure 1). Chatoyer may have been adopting an Atlantic rhetoric of rebellion to seek French alliances, but the mark, which suggests a Carib figure and perhaps even a Carib system of signification, points toward a distinctive co-optation and use of that rhetoric.2 In what follows I will use the case of the Caribs of St. Vincent to argue that indigenous groups continued to play a part in Caribbean politics well into the Age of Revolutions. Although recent scholarship on the Haitian Revolution has emphasized the centrality of African actors in fomenting change in the Atlantic world, the role of the Caribs, as well as of indigenous peoples overall, has largely been ignored. There are multiple reasons for this lack of attention to the Caribs: first, much of the historiography on the region continues to subscribe to myths of native disappearance. It cannot be denied, of course, that a large proportion of Amerindians were extermi nated by epidemics of Old World diseases or assimilated into colonial labor regimes after the arrival of the Spanish in the Americas. Yet as events such 2. For the epigraph, see William Young, An Account of the Black Charaibs in the Island of St. Vincent's; With the Charaib Treaty of1773, and Other Original Documents (London: J.

Second, the indigenous dimensions of Carib actions on St. Vin cent have been overlooked because colonial narratives produced about the Second Carib War worked to elide the indigeneity of the Caribs themselves. In particular, the British turned in the late eighteenth century to a strategy of renaming the Caribs of St. Vincent the Black Caribs and attributing primarily African origins to them. This strategy reflected the St. Vincent Caribs' tactic of incorporating with and forming alliances with Africans to strengthen their position on the island. Nevertheless, the non-European inhabitants of St. Vincent constituted a multiracial, as opposed to simply African, polity. Their political goals were also diverse and point to what</page><page sequence="5">Kim • The Caribs of St. Vincent and Indigenous Resistance | 121 Laurent Dubois and others have identified as the symbiotic or hybrid nature of late eighteenth-century revolutions, which borrowed and played off each other in the Atlantic world. While moving during the Second Carib War to align themselves with the republicanism of the 1790s, the Caribs of St. Vincent continued to pursue their older goal of freedom from imperial interference. They may have been classified as subject peoples by European observers, but their history nevertheless testifies to a long tradition of adap tation in the pursuit of independence.3 The classification of the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean, including St. Vincent, has been a long-standing problem in fields ranging from his tory and literary studies to anthropology and archaeology. Although most colonial and present-day accounts of St. Vincent use the term Carib to indicate the ethnicity of the Amerindians who fought against British rule, the name is an invention of early Spanish explorers and administrators, who divided the peoples they encountered in the Caribbean into the two group ings of Arawak and Carib to distinguish friendly from hostile natives. Any groups considered hostile were deemed Carib and troped as cannibals, a term that itself derives from Carib. Whether the Amerindians on St. Vin 3. I again am indebted to Melanie Newton for her insightful comments on the persistence of myths of native disappearance. See Newton, "Returns to a Native Land: Indigeneity and Decolonisation in the Anglophone Caribbean," Small Axe: A Caribbean Platform for Criticism, forthcoming. I should emphasize that I am also indebted to the scholarship on the Haitian Revolution and its African actors, whose importance I do not seek to minimize. Instead, I would like us to recognize the ways in which imperial taxonomies of race have written the Caribs of St. Vincent out of revolutionary histories. The scholarship on the Haitian Revolution is, of course, voluminous, but as a starting point, see C. L. R. James, The Black Jacobins: Toussaint L'Ouverture and the San Domingo Revolution (New York: Dial Press, 1938); Michel-Rolph Trouillot, Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of His tory (Boston: Beacon Press, 1995); David Patrick Geggus, Haitian Revolutionary Studies (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2002); and Laurent Dubois, Aveng ers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution (Cambridge: Harvard Uni versity Press, 2004). Dubois discusses how the French and Caribbean revolutions "emerged symbiotically" in his work on Guadeloupe, and David Armitage and San jay Subrahmanyam claim that the Age of Revolutions was characterized by "cultural and political hybridity."

In contrast, the original Carib inhabitants were renamed the Red or Yellow Caribs. As Neil Whitehead has argued in a recent essay on the Red-Black distinction, however, it suspiciously mirrors the older Arawak-Carib binary that structured early Spanish attempts at ethnic mapping and territorial conquest. And indeed, it is worth noting that the Red and Black Carib designations do not appear in British documents about the St. Vincent Car ibs until the late eighteenth century, precisely when British efforts to colo nize the island intensified in the wake of the Seven Years' War. As reading these colonial reports shows, the term Black Carib was used most frequently in the context of plans to appropriate Carib lands. For instance, William Young, who served as the head commissioner for the sale of lands on St. Vincent, referred to the "black Charibbs" in 1767 when reporting on the desirability of entering into negotiations with them for certain portions of the island. Young's son, also named William, similarly referred to the Black Caribs in his 1795 Account of the Black Charaibs, a desperate plea to metro politan authorities aimed at convincing them of the need to exterminate the Carib participants in the Second Carib War.5 The second Young's Account in particular shows how the Black Carib category may have emerged in British discourse because of its utility in arguments for native dispossession. Although Young's narrative of the ori gins of the Black Caribs constitutes just one version of events, he told a story that resonated with numerous other eighteenth-century accounts that began to identify the population of St. Vincent as largely African or "Black," as opposed to Amerindian or "Red." As the story goes, the Red Caribs lived 4.

Rescuing the African castaways, the Red Caribs incorporated the new arrivals into their numbers by enslaving them. Eventually, however, because the individuals who had been on the ship belonged to a "warlike Moco tribe from Africa," they overcame their captors by killing the men in warfare and taking possession of the women. By the time British settlers arrived after 1763, the Red Car ibs had thus supposedly been reduced to such a pitiable state that only a hundred of them were left on the island, whereas several thousand Black Caribs still remained to form the main source of opposition to colonial settlement.6 As Peter Hulme has pointed out, Young's narrative thus frames the Black Caribs, the majority of the Carib population of the island, as mere interlop ers from Africa. Furthermore, because they were African, as opposed to indigenous, they had no more claim to St. Vincent than did the British, and perhaps they had even less, since they had carried out the morally repre hensible action of exterminating the original Amerindians who had lived there. Young's narrative also turns the Black Caribs into the descendants of slaves, who would have lacked any claim to possession of the land and even their own persons, since they had escaped only by chance from their owners. We thus need to read the designation Black Carib as a convenient fiction that was used to distance any anti-British contingent on St. Vincent from the more sympathetic identity of the "noble" or innocent savage, whose rights were at least theoretically acknowledged in such Atlantic discourses as the Black Legend.7 Although the Black Carib label served British purposes, however, we also could read it as pointing to the tactics of interethnic alliance being pursued by the Caribs and other indigenous groups in the postcontact era. When the Spanish moved into the Caribbean in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, they set off a chain reaction of political and social reorganizations. Those who survived the initial rounds of decimation and assimilation responded by fleeing to the margins of Iberian control and regrouping as novel tribes and entities. The search for safe havens from European encroachers gave the Lesser Antilles a new geographical significance: because it lacked the rich mineral deposits and concentrated population 6.

These are the peoples that the Spanish identified as Caribs. In the seventeenth century, a second displacement occurred as French and British groups began arriving to try to colonize the Lesser Antilles themselves. Engaging in bloody conflicts with the inhabitants of such islands as St. Kitts, St. Lucia, Martinique, and Gua deloupe, they drove the Caribs to retreat once again to the islands of Dom inica and St. Vincent, whose mountainous, heavily wooded slopes provided an extra layer of defense.8 The increasingly heavy reliance of the French and British on African slavery brought further changes to the state of the Caribs, who continued to shift in terms of ethnic composition as they responded to new imperial labor regimes. In particular, the Caribs began incorporating not only diverse Amerindian populations into their numbers but also Africans from neigh boring islands. Some of these Africans were captured in slave raids carried out by the Caribs on Spanish colonies. Other Africans came to St. Vincent, however, in their own attempts to escape. As the Jesuit missionary Jean Baptiste Labat observed of St. Vincent in 1700: This [island] is the centre of the Carib Republic: the place where the savages are most numerous—Dominica not approaching it. Besides the savages, this island is 8. I have been influenced in my analysis here by James C. Scott's idea of "zones of refuge" created by the imposition of state power and the resultant attempts of marginalized groups to avoid the effects of governmental discipline. Scott in turn derives this idea of refuge from the anthropologist Gonzalo Aguirre Beltrán. See Scott, The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009), 22-26, 130-37; Beltrán, Regions of Ref uge (Washington, D.C.: Society for Applied Anthropology, 1979). My understand ing of the social reorganizations created by imperial expansion in the Caribbean specifically comes from Neil Whitehead's work on ethnogenesis. See Whitehead, "Tribes Make States and States Make Tribes," in R. Brian Ferguson and Neil L. Whitehead, eds., War in the Tribal Zone: Expanding States and Indigenous Wafare (Santa Fe: School of American Research Press, 1992), 127-50; Whitehead, "The Crises and Transformations of Invaded Societies: The Caribbean (1492-1580)," in Frank Salomon and Stuart B.

The Caribs formerly brought them back to their masters, when they were at peace with them or took and sold them to the French or Spaniards. I don't know for what reason they have changed their method, nor what has induced them to receive these negroes amongst themselves and to regard them as belonging to one and the same nation. Labat's early eighteenth-century description usefully highlights a new type of affiliation forming between the Amerindian and African populations of St. Vincent. Africans were arriving on the island in significant numbers by 1668, as is indicated by the fact that Barbados governor William Wil loughby negotiated a treaty that year with the St. Vincent Caribs requiring them to secure and deliver up any "Such as shall hereafter be fugitive from Bar[bados] or any other of ye english Islands Upon theyr Arryval." The Caribs were also required to acknowledge themselves subject to the English king. In return, the English promised to allow the Caribs to continue occu pying St. Vincent and St. Lucia. As Labat indicates, however, the Caribs did not comply with any part of the agreement and, furthermore, accepted the runaways from Barbados as belonging to "one and the same nation." Moreover, in adding to their numbers, the Caribs drew on long-standing practices of native adoption and ultimately formed a political entity that appeared formidable enough to be called a "Carib Republic."9 The fact that many of the new African members of the group came from English sugar plantations on Barbados also could be viewed as shaping later Carib antipathy to the British.

St. Vincent lay directly to the windward of Barbados, and, as a result, any boat or craft launched from the latter would almost invariably land on the former, even if its passengers made hardly any effort to steer. As another French observer reported in 1700, "it is not necessary to do anything other than drift on the currents." Figures for how many Africans escaped from Barbados to St. Vincent are difficult to find. Yet when an attempt was made by the second Duke of Montagu to settle St. Vincent with British colonists in 1722, John Brathwaite, the captain who led negoti ations with the Caribs, estimated that he had seen at least "Five Hundred Negroes." A later report from 1735 recorded even larger numbers: it claimed that the island was populated by six thousand Africans and four thousand Amerindians.10 When the first British settlers arrived in the 1760s, they thus confronted an entrenched population of Caribs who had formed themselves in opposi tion to the establishment of sugar colonies. The Caribs had also made strong alliances with the governments of neighboring, French-controlled islands. Carib-French contact began in the seventeenth century, when mis sionaries such as Labat, Breton, and Du Tertre traveled to the Lesser Antil les to proselytize and when early forms of economic exchange, based on a trade in subsistence provisions, connected the Caribs to French settlers. As Doris Garraway argues, the Lesser Antilles served as a kind of border region in which "the movement of people, ideas, commodities, culture, and lan guage" created new linkages between groups. That the French-Carib border was possessed of a notable "porousness" is demonstrated by the fact that the 10. For "it is not necessary," see Peter Hulme and Neil L.

Also see ibid., 171, for the idea that the origins of many of the St. Vincent Caribs in Barbados contributed to their anti-British stance. For Brathwaite's report, see Nathaniel Uring, A Relation of the Late Intended Settlement of the Islands of St. Lucia and St. Vincent, in America: In Right of the Duke of Montagu, and under His Grace's Direction and Orders, in the Year 1722 (London: J.

For the 1735 population estimates, see William Young, Considerations Which May Tend to Promote the Settlement of Our New West-India Colonies, by Encouraging Individuals to Embark in the Undertaking (London: James Robson, 1764), 102. These estimates should be read cautiously: Carib resistance to European interfer ence on the island meant that any population surveys were necessarily rough. Addi tionally, the Carib population was probably undergoing significant fluctuations during the eighteenth century as a result of conflicts with Europeans. For instance, the elder Young (Authentic Papers, 6) estimated that by 1767 there were only two thousand Caribs living on St. Vincent.</page><page sequence="11">Kim • The Caribs of St. Vincent and Indigenous Resistance | 127 Caribs of St. Vincent formed relationships with the various administrators of Martinique and even asked its governor in 1700 to help settle a dispute among themselves over territorial boundaries. The Caribs also allowed a number of French cultivators to occupy St. Vincent around the same time. Such a policy may seem to have run counter to Carib desires for autonomy, as the French established plantations and imported Africans as slave labor. Yet the French planters mostly cleared small-scale plots on which to grow crops such as coffee, cotton, and cacao, as opposed to sugar, and they lim ited their plantations to the leeward, or western side, of the island.11 The presence of French settlers on St. Vincent also had the effect of protecting the Caribs from other, potentially more threatening powers. Until 1763 Britain and France both recognized St. Vincent as one of several "neutral islands" in the Caribbean. St. Vincent's neutral status derived from its large population of Caribs, who made the prospect of outright conquest impractical and unappealing in the centuries leading up to the Seven Years' War. Yet while neither side wanted to expend the resources necessary to conquer the island, each wanted to prevent the other from gaining posses sion. Thus, Britain protested against the French settlements that started appearing on St. Vincent in the early eighteenth century. Even as it allowed settlement to continue, France similarly worked to protect the island as neutral and even insisted that it belonged to the Caribs, since its status as indigenous-held territory would nullify any British claims to St. Vincent. For instance, in 1748 France forced Britain to acknowledge the island's neutrality yet again in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.12 There is evidence that the Caribs recognized the advantages of allying with France. For instance, in 1768, when Young and the other settlement 11.

Appearing for the first time in the historical record, Chatoyer not only refused the British his per mission but also declared, "Quel roi?—what king was this, of Great Brit ain?—They would listen to the governor of Martinique, and no other." Invoking the older relationship of the Caribs with Martinique, Chatoyer rejected new British claims of sovereignty. The Caribs also exploited their ties with the French in a more tangible way in 1778, as France and Britain went to war during the American Revolution. Cannily picking up on the political advantage that could be gained from exploiting this rivalry, the Caribs asked the French for military support to oust the new occupiers of St. Vincent. French troops arrived in 1779, and the Caribs enjoyed four years of liberty from British sovereignty until 1783, when France again ceded its claims to the island at the conclusion of the war.13 The return of the British after the American Revolution indicates the difficulties that the Caribs faced in the second half of the eighteenth cen tury. Although they had managed to maintain a considerable degree of autonomy up to this period, they had also suffered from the increasingly aggressive attempts by the British to settle St. Vincent and the resultant constrictions on their mobility and freedom. The First Carib War in 1772-73 exemplifies the increased pressure put on the Caribs and their territory. The First Carib War was initiated by the attempts of the St. Vin cent settlement commissioners to start surveying and then selling land on the island's windward, or eastern, half, which constituted the heart of the 13. For Chatoyer's 1768 response, see Young, Account of the Black Charaibs, 38. Also see Account of the Black Charaibs, 100-103, for an account of the Carib-French alliance during the American Revolution. In formulating the Caribs as exploiting the imperial rivalry of the British and the French, I am drawing on Richard White's influential concept of the middle ground. Although the concept should certainly be applied with caution outside the pays d'en haut, St. Vincent and the Lesser Antilles as a whole bear striking similarities to White's original region of study because their populations and bounds were also defined by processes of imperial encroachment, forced migration, and ethnic disintegration and reorganization. Moreover, the Car ibs of St. Vincent, like the Amerindians of the Great Lakes, were poised between two powers unable to take full control of their territory.

Because of their superior knowledge of St. Vincent's mountainous terrain, the Caribs were actually able to stymie the British troops and stall their advance. Yet because the British forces did succeed in gaining some ground, the Caribs were forced to agree in 1773 to a peace treaty that reduced their land holdings by two thousand acres and declared them officially subject to the British Crown.14 Still, in the 1790s the Caribs made one more effort to oust the British in the midst of the Atlantic revolutions. The events of this decade brought truly stunning changes to the environs of St. Vincent. Not only did the slaves of St. Domingue rise up against their masters in 1791, but also numerous other revolts took place throughout the Caribbean. The Caribs of St. Vincent started their own anticolonial war in March 1795 by burning sugar plantations and killing the masters, as well as any slaves who refused to join their cause. At the same time, they recruited the assistance not only of the approximately four thousand French settlers and enslaved Africans still living on St. Vincent but also of French military forces from Guade loupe. As recently as 1794, Guadeloupe had been under British control. In that year, however, the Jacobin leader Victor Hugues arrived with a Repub lican army to reclaim the island and bring emancipation to its slave popula tion. In a remarkable Caribbean career, Hugues turned Guadeloupe into a base for other attacks against British colonies in the region. Declaring the Caribs "our friends and loyal allies," Hugues helped foment simultaneous revolts on Grenada and St. Lucia. In particular, he sent a multiracial force of free gens de couleur, ex-slaves, and white Frenchmen to fight in St. Vincent alongside an already diverse force of Caribs, French settlers, and French and British slaves. The racial horror that such a coalition evoked among British settlers is best expressed by the St. Vincent botanist Alexander Anderson, who named it a "motley garrison" in his unpublished history of the Second Carib War. He further stated, "It was disgusting to a British soldier to go through the maneuvers of such a mixed gang which merited no better appellation than banditti."15 14.

The desperation of the British in the conflict's first few months, which brought significant Carib and French victories, is captured by James Seton, the governor of St. Vincent, who wished for reinforcements that would allow him "not only to repel but totally to exterminate this sav age &amp; Merciless Race of Charaibs." Although reinforcements arrived, the Caribs and their allies proved adept at evading capture. As they had during the First Carib War, they took advantage of their knowledge of the environ ment not only to carry out ambushes but also to survive. As Anderson noted, the Caribs were able to withstand a "great deal of fatigue" and to be satisfied with only small amounts of food, such as "a little farina of cava root" or "leaves of trees and roots of all kinds that were in the least digest ible." Military dispatches also reveal that the Caribs maintained hidden pro vision grounds that furnished them with plantains, yams, and other staples. In the end, the British victory derived mainly from a strategic decision to eliminate these provision grounds and thereby starve the Caribs and their allies out of the woods.16 It still took several years to bring the war to a definitive conclusion because the Caribs proved willing to fight on to preserve even the smallest modicum of freedom. For instance, although the French forces agreed to surrender in June 1796, a little over a year after the war had begun, the Caribs themselves refused to abide by the official articles of capitulation and remained in the mountains, from which they continued to carry out guerilla-style attacks on British troops. As one disheartened soldier wrote in a letter to his father, "we still keep the field and [are] engaged in a horrid, butchering War with the Caribs who neither give nor receive quarter." Many British observers felt betrayed by the Caribs after the official surren der and believed that they had agreed to it only to gain a respite from the conflict.

As young Chatoyé report edly told the British negotiators, "It is no disgrace to Caraibs to surrender to a great Nation. The Subjects of France and all great Nations, even of England, are obliged to submit to each other, when there no longer remains the means of resistance." Framing the Caribs as members of a nation equal in status to France, England, or any other European power, young Cha toyé's statement stands as a challenge to British attempts to deny the sover eignty of St. Vincent's indigenous peoples and take away their land. Perhaps it should come as no surprise, then, that on the day that the Caribs were supposed to turn themselves in, only a few hundred of their more than four thousand members appeared.17 The Caribs did eventually surrender a few months later because many of them had, by that point, succumbed to starvation and death. As Anderson observed, the survivors presented a "dreadful spectacle of misery and dis tress." The situation of the Caribs improved little afterward, as the British determined to exile them from St. Vincent. Deporting them first to Balli ceaux, a small island near St. Vincent, British military forces presided over the deaths of approximately half of the Caribs who had initially arrived there. Although the exact causes of the deaths are unknown, it seems likely that the continued effects of famine, as well as an outbreak of yellow fever or another epidemic disease, worked to decimate the Carib population. Reduced to a fraction of their original numbers, the Caribs were then trans ported from Balliceaux to Roatán, an island off the coast of Flonduras. Removed from their homeland, the Caribs thus seem to stand for yet another example of futile resistance against imperial domination.18 Nevertheless, the Caribs had successfully eluded control for centuries. Amerindian groups had settled on St. Vincent well before European con quest and turned it into a Carib republic, a refuge and retreat from en croaching powers. They had also shown flexibility in incorporating runaway Africans into their numbers and undergoing processes of ethnogenesis that 17.

Throughout the eighteenth century the Caribs not only manifested an antipathy to Brit ish rule but also formed alliances with the French to maintain a neutral ground between imperial rivals. They continued to engage in sophisticated political maneuverings by recognizing and taking advantage of revolutionary conflicts in the 1780s and 1790s. Even after the British formally acquired St. Vincent in 1763, the Caribs succeeded in ousting them from the island in 1779 and in prosecuting a long, drawn-out campaign in 1795 and 1796. Most significantly, even as the British labeled them 'Black Caribs' and denied their indigeneity, the Caribs of St. Vincent acted in ways that dem onstrated a distinct sense of purpose and identity. Leaders such as Chatoyer invoked French ideas of subjecthood and citizenship, but they did so only when it helped them achieve their own goal of territorial autonomy, as is demonstrated by the refusal of the Caribs to surrender with the French troops in the summer of 1796. The position of the Caribs is perhaps best summed up by what one unnamed leader said upon being questioned about his loyalties by José Rossi y Rubí, a Guatemalan citizen who had arrived at Roatán to negotiate with the Caribs about their resettlement on the main land of Central America. As the Carib leader proclaimed, "I do not com mand in the name of anyone. I am not English, nor French, nor Spanish, nor do I care to be any of these. I am a Carib, a Carib subordinate to no one. I do not care to be more or to have more than I have." While we could read this statement as a resigned acknowledgment of the Caribs' newly con strained position, we should also take it as a final, defiant statement of independence and self-sufficiency.19 19. The Carib leader is quoted in González, Sojourners of the Caribbean, 48.
