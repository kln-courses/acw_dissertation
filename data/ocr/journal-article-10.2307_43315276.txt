<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE IDENTITY OF THE EOTENAS 1 Eotenas move freely throughout Beowulf. Problematic as it may be to refer to this race of beings by the genitive plural form of their name, it is hard to know what else to call them: they are a group whose identity is simultaneously based upon and obscured by the grammatical vagaries of Old English. The complication lies in the two very similar words eoten (or eoton ), "giant," and Eotan , "Jutes," Germanic invaders of Britain who settled in Wight, Kent, and Hampshire. Their tribal name, latinized to luti by Bede1 and later historians, was anglicized to the West Saxon Ytan , Northumbrian I otan, and Anglian Eotan } The near- homographs eoten and Eotan become particularly troublesome in their dative plural and genitive plural forms. The dative plural of eoten is eotenum , and that of Eotan is Eotum, two words enough alike that they could conceivably be subject to scribal error. Indeed, translators almost uniformly assume that when eotenum occurs in the Zte&lt;9ww//manuscript, it is a scribal error for Eotum ? J.R.R. Tolkien argues that an -(e)num dative plural ending of a weak noun "is not an impossible late form."4 R.A. Williams concedes that although this is theoretically true, "no one has proved that the form Eot(e)num actually existed."5 It is possible, of course, that a scribe might have confused the two forms and written down the former when he meant the latter, but this seems an unnecessary complication, for the poem is populated by as many monstrous races as hostile neighboring tribes. It seems likely that the precedent for this decision was set by the prejudices of early critics, Tolkien and Williams included, who were clearly embarrassed by, and therefore eager to downplay, the poem's marvellous aspects.6 As it turns out, there is no need to concoct elaborate theories of scribal misinterpretation; an examination of the contexts in which the word appears makes it clear that there is no reason not to trust that the text means what it says. On the other hand, the genitive plural case is legitimately ambiguous: for both words, it is eotena. The poet is acutely sensitive to this ambiguity and employs the homonym as the crux which holds Geatish and Danish power in balance. It should first be noted that the poet was hardly forced by necessity to use eoten where he meant "giant." There are a number of other words in the Old English lexicon which may be assigned to an outsized monstrous creature, of which Beowulf contains three: pyrs, gigant , and ent.1 Pyrs, cognate with the Icelandic purs, is the only one of these terms directly used as an appellation for Grendel (426a).8,9 Gigant is a clear borrowing from the Latin gigas , "giant." Since the sword in Grendel's cave is described as both giganta geweorc (1562b) and enta œr geweorc (1679a), we can conclude that an ent is, if not precisely the same sort of creature as a gigant , then at least a very close relative. Every decision to use eoten (or one of its related forms) is a deliberate one. There are some instances in which forms of eoten are generally agreed to mean "giant."10 Grendel, of course, is an eoten (761a), and thus Beowulf, lying in wait for his adversary, is an eotonweard (668b). Beowulf reports that his counsellors agreed with the plan to confront Grendel because</page><page sequence="2">8 JACQUELINE STUHMILLER seife ofersawon öa ic of searwum cwom, fah from feondum, ķaer ic fife geband, yöde eotena cyn, ond on yöum slog niceras nihtes, nearoķearfe dreah, wraec Wedera niõ - wean ahsodon - forgrand gramum; (4 1 9-24a) 1 1 This feat is grammatically, but not thematically, ambiguous: Beowulf is clearly telling the story of his triumphs over unnatural adversaries, not hostile Germans, triumphs which are intended as a convincing testimonial to his ability to destroy Grendel. Hrothgar's scop uses a very similar phrase when singing of Sigemund, the legendary Germanic hero who kills a large number of eotena cynnes (883b) in his youth. Again, however, it is difficult to perceive any ambiguity of meaning. As has often been noted, Beowulf is the Geatish reincarnation of Sigemund. The apogee of both heroes' careers is the killing of a dragon; it seems not unreasonable to assume that both should prepare for their final endeavors by slaying the troublesome giants who roam freely in this part of the world. Nor does anyone seem to have quibbled over either of the instances in which eoten is used adjectivally. In a dire moment, Beowulf's eye lights upon an ealdsweord eotenisc (1558a) in the mere-cave, a giant's sword in a giant's house, on which is inscribed the story of God's destruction of an ancient wicked race of giants. Lest any confusion remain regarding the weapon's provenance, it is renamed several lines later with the appositive giganta geweorc (1562b). Higelac's son Eofor also bears an ealdsweord eotenisc (2979a) which he uses to cut through Ongentheow's enfisene helm (2979b). Interpreted as "giantish," the epithet gives both poetic symmetry to the line and poetic justice to the outcome of the battle; "Jutish" gives neither. But not every instance of eoten- is agreed upon. A certain amount of sporadic conflict has arisen over the identity of the eotenas who congregate in two locations within the poem: the description of Heremod (902-15) and the so-called "Finn episode" (1071-1 159). The first of these is fairly easy to assess, though the results conflict with many scholars' conclusions. Heremod, a king of the Danes in former days, is twice invoked as the exemplum of the bad ruler. Corrupted by sin, "He mid eotenum12 wearõ/ on feonda geweald forò forlacen,/ snude forsended." (902b-4a) 1314 The part which the eotenas play in this drama is debatable - they may have handed him over to his human enemies, or killed him themselves - but in any case it is clear that the word which describes the traitors is the dative plural of eoten , not Eotan. Furthermore, a careful reading of the passage strongly suggests that his killers were most likely giants. The story of Heremod's misfortunes is recounted as both a foil to Sigemund's successes (901 ff.) and as a warning to Beowulf that he rule his people well (1709 ff.) If Sigemund and Beowulf are renowned for their battles against eotenas, then it seems only just that Heremod should be punished for his depravity by falling into the hands of these same creatures.15</page><page sequence="3">On the Identity of the ' Eotenas 9 Nevertheless, the majority of translators have rejected the notion that Heremod was slaughtered by ogres, insisting rather that he met his end among hostile members of his own species.16 It is a decision which provides more information about the biases of a modern audience than about the Beowulf- poet's real intentions. Things are much neater if one assumes that Heremod was destroyed by Jutes. First, such an interpretation neatly removes the embarrassing fabulous elements, changing what would otherwise be a "fantastic" (and therefore untrue) digression into a purely "historical" (and therefore true) one. Then, too, such a fate seems more inherently just: this burden to the human race receives a well- deserved comeuppance by members of that same race. The majority of the disputed forms - three genitive plural and one dative plural - occur within the second passage, the "Finn Episode" (1071-1159). This story of the conflict between the Frisians and Danes is recounted by Hrothgar's scop during the celebrations which follow Beowulf's defeat of Grendel.17 Finn, prince of the Frisians, has married Hildeburh, a woman of the Danes. Hildeburh's brother, Hnaef, comes with his retinue to the Frisian court on a peaceful mission. While under Finn's protection, the Danes are attacked and both Hnaef and Hildeburh's son are killed; for this wicked deed, "Ne huru Hildeburh herian ļsorfte/ eotena treowe" (1071-2a).18 The Frisians and Danes come to a bloody standoff, neither side able to destroy the other, ac hig him gefcingo budon, ļ)aet hie him oöer flet eal gerymdon, healle ond heahsetl, ķaet hie healfre geweald wiõ eotena beam aganmoston, (1085b-8)19 The pronoun referents are ambiguous, but it seems most likely that the Danes, who are now lead by Hengest, make a treaty with Finn, promising that they will share a new hall with the eotena beam (1088a). Hengest broods over this agreement, however, and although he longs to leave Finnsburh, he to gyrnwraece swiõor fcohte bonne to saelade, gif he torngemot ķurhteon mihte ļ)aet he eotena beam inne gemunde. ( 1 138b - 41)20 He finally vows to seek revenge, remembering the sword given to him, "ļ)aes waeron mid eotenum ecge cuõe" ( 1 145).21 It is not long before Finn is slain (perhaps by that very sword), the Frisian court ransacked, and Hildeburh returned to her own people. Let us first examine the unique dative plural form in the Finn Episode, as the controversy over its meaning is relatively easy to resolve. A cursory examination of the poem reveals that swords of great renown or price are often connected with giants, whether made by them or responsible for their slaughter. Grendel himself has an antagonistic relationship to edged weapons:</page><page sequence="4">1 0 JACQUELINE STUHMILLER J&gt;one synscaöan aenig ofer eorķan irenna cyst, guöbilla nan gretan nolde; ac he sigewaepnum forsworen haefde, ecga gehwylcre. (801b-5a)22 Beowulf uses a giant's sword against Grendel's mother; Eofor destroys the Swedes with an ealdsweord eotenisc ; Sigemund and Fitela "haefdon ealfela eotena cynnes/sweordum gesaeged" (883-4a).23 The sword given to Hengest, so far as it reminds him of his vow, is at least indirectly responsible for the carnage which follows. If Hengest fights the final battle against a race of men called Eotens (and there is no proof that he does), then at this point in the poem it makes less sense that his sword is known among the Eotens than that it will be known. It seems far more likely that this crucial weapon is yet another ealdsweord eotenisc . There remain the four occurrences of the legitimately ambiguous genitive plural form in the Finn Episode, and here the critical debate becomes exceedingly complex. R. A. Williams identifies a double pair of ambiguities in the passage: first, does eotena mean "Jutes" or "giants"? and second, is it the alternate name of either the Danes or the Frisians, or does it refer to a third party allied with one or the other of the tribes?24 Williams is quick to point out that, in general, Teutonic sagas are liberally sprinkled with giants, and so there should be no reason to discount the possibility of ogres lumbering around the battlefield. In theory, perhaps. But the relationship between humans and giants in Beowulf is consistently antagonistic; even allowing for the uncertainties surrounding Heremod's betrayal, there are no instances in which the two races can be definitely said to cooperate with each other, even for evil purposes. It is difficult for one side to be guilty of a breach of treow when there could have been no trust between the parties to begin with. It seems unarguable that the Eotenas must be human beings, not monsters. Indeed, the general assumption among critics and translators seems to be that within the Finn Episode, eotena is the genitive plural form of "Jutes." Williams' second question is far more difficult to answer. Early critics seem to have assumed that the Jutes were the same people as the Frisians,25,26 perhaps following the conjectures of the nineteenth-century scholar Sophus Bugge.27 This interpretation likely gained widespread approval for a time because it transforms what might be an incomprehen- sible jumble of allusions and free-floating pronouns into a story which is neat and compact: the Frisians betray, make a peace treaty with, and are eventually conquered by, the Danes. W.W. Lawrence posited in 1909 that "Danes" and "Frisians" should be understood as collocations of tribes, rather than discrete tribes in themselves, and this view was endorsed again in 1959 by R.W. Chambers.28 Since then, it has become widely accepted, but this has done little to further critical agreement. Every possible permutation has been suggested by scholars: both dative and genitive plural forms in the Finn Episode mean "Jutes";29 the genitive is ambiguous (and so could go either way) but the dative clearly means "giants";30 all mean "giants";31 all mean "giants" in a figurative sense.32 Of those who believe that the</page><page sequence="5">On the Identity of the ' Eotenas ' 1 1 the poem makes reference to the Jutes, some have claimed that the Jutes fought on Finn's side,33 Hengesťs side,34 or both sides.35 Various critics have claimed that Hengest is a Dane,36 a Jute,37 a Frisian,38 or an Angle.39 Nothing concrete has emerged from of this jumble of opinions, so let us set aside the apparently unresolvable question of which racial group is in question, on which side it fought, and what exactly the epithet eotena may imply. We can assume certain things with a reasonable amount of safety: the faithlessness of the Eotenas, whoever they might be, is responsible for the initial defeat of the Danes; according to the peace terms, the Eotenas are to share a hall with one of the feuding parties; and it is their memory which goads Hengest to revenge. All else is conjecture. What is clear, and strikingly so, is that after the Finn Episode, no form of eoten or eotan, ambiguous or otherwise, appears again in the poem. This is not because there are no more giants to be conquered: Grendel's mother will attack that very night. Though presumably of the same race as her son, she is never described as such. She is an ides aglœcwifi 1259a), a brimwylfi 1506a), a merewif (1519a), a host of other chimeric designations, but never an eoten. Nor is the dearth of eotenas attributable to the fact that there are no more objects of giantish manufacture to be encountered: the dragon's treasure chamber (2717b) and the treasure itself (2774a) are both enta geweorc ; the sword which kills Grendel's mother is an enta œrgeweorc (1679a), also called a giganta geweorc (1562b), and on it is inscribed the story of God's wrath against the giganta cyn (1690b). I suggest that the word is never used again because it fulfills its intended function in the Finn Episode; its conspicuous absence from the remainder of the poem only serves to underscore the effect. To see this function, the episode must be put into context. Beowulf destroys the eoten who has tormented the Danes for a long while, decimating their army and demoralizing the survivors. The monster is gone, but the Danes are, in a sense, no better off: they have done nothing but trade one invader for another. Beowulf the Geat enters their land and royal hall without resistance, demonstrates the cowardice of the Danish warriors and the impotence of their king, is heaped with ancestral Danish treasures, and consequently is named Hrothgar's adoptive son. In an effort to rectify some of the social damage that has been done, Wealtheow reminds Beowulf of his obligations: wene ic t&gt;aet he mid gode gyldan wille uncran eaferan, gif he ķaet eal gemon, hwaet wit to willan ond to worömyndum umborwesendum aer arna gefremedon. (1 184-7)40 It is no coincidence that the unnamed scop, who might be thought of as the voice of Heorot itself, sings of the trouble caused by the Eotan, who are formidable and bloodthirsty opponents, regardless of their exact racial identity. The message is clear: the Geats may have vanquished this particular eotena , but the Danes have eradicated whole hosts of them in the past, against tremendous odds.</page><page sequence="6">1 2 JACQUELINE STUHMILLER The unresolved controversy surrounding the homonyms eoten and Eotan has primarily served to occlude the elaborate and extensive double-entendre which the Beowulf- poet carefully weaves into the first third of his poem. Grendel may be a fiend on were s wœstmum (1352a), but it is no less important to acknowledge that Beowulf himself, from a Danish viewpoint, at any rate, is a rapacious eoten of sorts.

Chambers, Beowulf: An Introduction (Cambridge UP, 1959), pp. 334-7. 3 As will be discussed later, the word eotenum occurs twice in the Beowulf manuscript. A survey of ten randomly-chosen translators from 1921 to 1991 reveals that only one translator [Stanley Greenfield, A Readable Beowulf (Carbondâle, Illinois: Southern Illinois UP, 1982)] translates the word as "giants" - and he does so for only one of the occurrences. 4 Tolkien (1982), p. 62. He goes on to make the rather inflexible claim that "neither Scribe A nor Scribe B knew much about the old proper names, and either because of their own ignorance, or because they represent the culmination of a process of forgetfulness and corruption, less reliance can be placed on the forms of proper names in Beowulf than on any other class of word." 5 R.A. Williams, The Finn Episode in Beowulf (Cambridge UP, 1924), p. 139. 6 The notion that the supernatural is unworthy of attention seems to have infected the minds of even the most liberal of critics. Williams (1924), an enthusiastic supporter of the "eöte«a-as-giants" theory, writes: "To us it is of course highly regrettable that a fine fellow like Beowulf should have nothing better to do than wrestle with a puerile product of primitive imaginings like Grendel. To us it seems simply inexcusable that the poet should have all that human interest at his command, which was given with the relations of the Danes and the Heatho-Beardan, and actually put it in the background. But he did this and I have no doubt he earned the gratitude of his hearers." (p. 142) Even J.R.R. Tolkien, whose groundbreaking essay labors to demonstrate that monsters play an integral role in the poem, is blinkered by his own biases: "But there is also, I suppose, a real question of taste involved: a judgment that the heroic or tragic story on a strictly human plane is by nature superior."

Christopher Tolkien (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1984), p. 15.] 7 For a more detailed discussion of these terms, see E.G.

John Block Friedman agrees that Grendel should be seen as monstrous man rather than anthropomorphic monster: "They [Grendel and his mother] are by no means merely local water trolls whose depredations at the court of Hrothgar come from hunger or evil temper and who have been given an aura of antiquity and universality by their association with Cain. Rather their elaborate genealogy ensures their membership in Adam's family, though distantly, and means that they belong to the same species as their victims." [The Monstrous Races in Medieval Art and Thought (Cam- bridge, Mass: Harvard UP, 1981), pp. 105-6.] 10 Robert E. Kaske, "The Eotenas in Beowulf," in Old English Poetry : Fifteen Essays , ed. Robert R Creed (Providence, Rhode Island: Brown UP, 1967), pp. 285-310. 11 "they themselves [my people] saw me come from combat as the victor, where I vanquished five great eotenas , rooted out their race; though sore beset, slew sea-beasts at night, crushed foes who fiercely sought destruction, righted the Weders' wrongs" (419-24) Here and elsewhere, I choose to reproduce the translation of Stanley Greenfield's A Readable Beowulf Of all the translations I have read, I find this one to be the closest, both literally and aesthetically, to the original. In order to prevent bias from creeping into the translations (and because Greenfield and I do not always agree), I consistently retain the word eotena , untranslated. 12 Here, as well as in the Finn Episode, Jack chooses to capitalize the disputed forms. In a footnote to line 902, however, he notes the complication created by the eoten/Eotan homonyms. 13 "[He], betrayed into his foe's hands while fighting among eotenas , forthwith was dispatched." (902^) 14 Tolkien (1982) suggests that the passage might instead refer to Sigemund rather than Heremod, though the possibility is slim. If it refers to Sigemund, it means "giants"; if to Heremod, it means "Jutes" (pp. 54-60). He bases his conjecture on the assumption that "Jutland was a natural haven" for exiled Danes. 15 For a similar claim, see Johann Köberl, "The Magic Sword in Beowulf" Neophilologus 7 1 ( 1987), pp. 120-128. 16 An exception is Greenfield (1982), who seems to acknowledge the possible ambiguity with an ambiguity of his own: "Heremod, betrayed into his foe's hands/ while fighting among giants, forthwith/ was dispatched." (cf. endnote 13) Edwin Morgan ( 1952) and Frederick Rebsamen (1991) step around this problem entirely by translating the word as "fiends" and "fiend-creatures," respectively. 17 Because reconstructions of the Finn Episode vary so widely, I for the most part follow Jack's interpretation, which seems most logical to me. For other reconstructions, see Richard North, "Tribal Loyalties in the Finnsburh Fragment and Episode," Leeds Studies in English n.s. 21 (1990), pp. 13- 43, and Tolkien (1982). 18 "Indeed Hildeburh had little need to praise the eotenas ' good faith:" (1071-2) 19 "so they fashioned terms: they would clear all of another hall, floor and dais, which the Danes would share jointly with the sons of the eotenas (1085-8) 20 "yet he thought more of revenge than riding to sea, how he could effect an encounter which would settle his score with the eotenas ."

Some recent scholars also subscribe to this view. See North (1990); Lewis E. Nicholson, "The Literary Implications of Initial Unstable H in Beowulf Classica et Mediaevalia 35 (1984), pp. 265-83. 26 In my informal survey of translators, three out of ten [Gavin Bone (1945), Mary E. Waterhouse (1949), and Gildas Roberts (1984)] use the names 'Jutes' and 'Frisians' interchangeably. Apparently, the confusion has not yet died out. 27 For a discussion (and refutation) of Bugge's theories, see Chambers (1959), pp. 257-65. 28 Chambers (1959), p. 288. 29 Tolkien (1982); Chambers (1959); North (1990). 30 Williams (1924). 31 David Williams, Cain and Beowulf: A Study in Secular Allegoiy (U of Toronto P, 1982). 32 Kaske (1967) offers the argument that the Jutes are never mentioned at all: all forms are actually cases of eoten , which serves as an epithet for the Frisians (who had a reputation as giants in the medieval world) and means "enemies" or "proud men." 33 Chambers (1959), p. 276. 34 Chambers (1959), pp. 254-7. 35 Tolkien (1982); Jack (1994); North (1990). North creates an imaginative but unfortunately tenuous reconstruction of the Finnsburh episode in which "... among Hnaef 's Half-Danes there were Jutes, Danes, or Scyldings, perhaps Hocings, and Secgan (if not other tribes); and in Finn's army, Frisians and Jutes."
