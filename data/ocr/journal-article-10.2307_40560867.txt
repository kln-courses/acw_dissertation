<plain_text><page sequence="1">World Natural History. E. G. Boulenger. 14 χ 22 5 cm. xxt 268 pp. Batsford. 1937. 7/6. From Batsford readers have learnt to expect a bargain in the way of illustrated production, and this book is no exception, containing, as it does, 150 excellent photographs and 26 line drawings by Mr. Brightwell. For the writing of such a general natural work no one is better qualified than Mr. Boulenger. H. G. Wells, in the introduction which he has contributed, writes the best review the book can have when he calls it " a necessary supplement to visits to the Zoo." It introduces the general public to the whole animal kingdom, arranged in systematic order, and gives some of the characteristics on which this systematic grouping is based and by which the affinities between animals are calculated. One may quarrel with the author for starting his review at the top of the family tree instead of at the bottom, but one cannot deny that he has done it well. In an encyclo- paedic work of this kind a few slips may be forgiven, but it would be interesting to hear evidence for the statement on p. 95 that the Bactrian camel is " widely used in Australia and in the semi-desert areas of America." The reviewer knows of no reference to this species in Australian literature, and although there were importations of Bactrians into America in 1859 and 1862, of which some remnants may survive in a feral condition, the statement that they are in " use " requires substantiating. The book is open to two serious criticisms ; first, the excessive- use of the anthropomorphic view-point. It is a mistake to think that such a view-point is inseparable from a popular presentation of the facts. In the general introduction to Rodents on p. 63, these animals are said to " infest " every part of the globe, and on p. 95 the " dromedary," by which apparently is meant the Arabian species as a whole, is accused of a " morose disposition." The second serious blemish in this book is the absence of authorities for th© scientific names. At a time when many amateurs are anxious to work on genuinely scientific and scholarly lines, it seems a great pity that a reference work, if it gives Latin names at all, should not give them accurately.
