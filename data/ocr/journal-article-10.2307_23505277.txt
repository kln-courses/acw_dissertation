<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUPPLEMENTARY STUDIES IN THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL JULIAN MORGENSTERN, Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati, Ohio Introduction THE calendar system of ancient Israel has long been diligently studied, and rightly so, for it is of necessity closely inter woven with the evolution of Israel's religious, cultural, and eco nomic life. Scholars have clearly recognized inherent difficulties in this investigation, and many and various have been the hypo theses proposed, but with no apparent agreement as to a final solution of the different problems and determination of the cor rect history of the calendar. That certain passages of the Bible indicate that the day was reckoned from sunrise while others assume very positively a day reckoned from sunset, that the Bible employs three different methods of designating the months, that certain passages of the Bible regard the year as beginning in the fall, while others quite as unmistakably regard it as begin ning in the spring, that some of the passages which record the beginning of the year in the fall, fix the New Year's Day upon VII/10 while other passages fix the New Year's Day upon VII/1, these and other similar facts and the problems inherent in them have long been perceived by scholars, but the efforts at the solu tion of these problems seemed for many years to revolve in a vain and endless circle. The basic error of the investigators of this complex problem of the calendar of ancient Israel, as well as of many other kindred problems, was their tacit assumption, despite actual knowledge to the contrary, that as a historical document, as a source of historical information, the Bible was a literary unit, and that the cultural history of Israel was likewise completely unified and its cultural life the very same, or almost the same, throughout 1</page><page sequence="2">2 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [2] the entire biblical period. From this they concluded further, and particularly with reference to this specific problem, that broadly speaking only one calendar was current during the whole biblical period, and that, accordingly, the confused and oft-times contra dictory biblical data with regard to the calendar, the records of a twofold beginning of the year, for example, represent mere accidents, or at the most mere incidents, in the history of the calendar of ancient Israel, which demand harmonization with the generally accepted bases of the calendar system rather than a penetrating investigation into their correct implications. True, some of these scholars did suggest quite hypothetically that these variant and contradictory data of the calendar system of ancient Israel might well indicate that not one, but two calen dars, differing, however, but little one from the other, may have been current during the biblical period; but whether these two calendars were observed simultaneously or successively, what their mutual relationship may have been, what the occasion and what the causes for the transition from one to the other, and other related questions remained largely matters of theory and speculation, supported by little searching and convincing evi dence. A new stage in the investigation of the problem of the cal endar of ancient Israel was marked by the appearance of a learned article by E. Kônig in 1906.1 This eminent scholar reviews care fully and in detail the hypotheses and conclusions proposed by earlier scholars and then advances his own conclusions. He maintains that two distinct calendars were current in ancient Israel. The first, a solar calendar, was identical practically with that of the Phoenicians and the Canaanite predecessors of Israel in Palestine. This solar calendar was well adapted to the con ditions of the simple, agricultural life which the Israelites lived during the first period of their sojourn in Palestine. It reckoned the day from sunrise and the year from an appropriate date in the fall. It employed the old Canaanite-Phoenician names of the months. These were solar months of apparently thirty days 1 "Kalenderfragen im althebrâischen Schrifttum," ZDMG, LX (1906), 605-644.</page><page sequence="3">[3] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL each. The Asif, later the Sukkot, festival came at the end of the year.2 The second calendar was a luni-solar year, which operated with lunar months alone and in consequence must have had some system of intercalation by which the lunar and the solar years were harmonized. These lunar months were designated at first by ordinal numbers, first month, second month, etc., but eventually the Babylonian month names, Nisan, Iyyar, etc., were equated with and frequently substituted for them. A luni solar year naturally necessitated increased cognizance of the moon and its phases. The day now came quite naturally to be reckoned from sunset, and the day of the full moon in each month came to play an increasingly important role in the calendar organization, so that the Passover-Mazzot festival and the Suk kot festival were transferred from their original moments of celebration to the full moons of the first and seventh months respectively. At first the New Year's Day continued to be cele brated in the fall, originally upon VII/10, but later upon VII/1; eventually, however, the New Year's Day was transferred to 1/1. This latter system of dating and celebrating the New Year's Day, however, did not supplant the older method of celebrating this important festival upon VII/1. For quite a long period both systems seem to have existed simultaneously; eventually, how ever, the later system succumbed to the older system, and ever since the New Year's Day has been observed in the Jewish cal endar upon the first of Tishri. This second calendar was obviously based upon Babylonian models and was adopted under direct Babylonian influence at about 600 B.c., when Babylonian religion and general culture began to affect with steadily increas ing force the Jewish exiles in Babylonia and, through those of them who returned from exile, the Jews who had remained in Palestine. This broadly sums up Kônig's conclusions. It can be seen י י Ex. 23.16b; 34.22b; cf. also the interesting thesis of P. Nillson; "Sonnen kalender und Sonnenreligion," ARW, 30 (1933), 141-173, that under a luni solar calendar true solar religion is not possible of observance; cf. also my "Two"Two Ancient Israelite Agricultural Festivals," JQR, N.

That Kônig himself did not regard his article as a final solution of the complex and many-sided problem of the calendar system of ancient Israel is best evidenced by the fact that he entitled it "Kalenderfragen," "Questions concerning the Calendar." A renewed study of the calendar of ancient Israel, largely upon the basis of Kônig's article, was made by Ginzel,3 with, however, little of significance added to that which Kônig had previously brought forth, other than a certain correlation of the calendar of ancient Israel with the calendars of other early peoples, particularly the Babylonians. In the main he accepts Kônig's arguments and conclusions. In two articles, published some years ago,4 I took up entirely anew the problem of the calendar system of ancient Israel during the biblical period, and endeavored to establish that at different times throughout this thousand-year period, not two, as Kônig 3 Handbuch der mathematischen und technischen Chronologie, II (1911), 1-119; cf. also the brief and superficial discussion in A.

Calendar I, practically identical with the first calendar which Kônig had postulated, was a purely solar calendar, completely adapted to the conditions of a simple, agricultural life. It had apparently been the calendar employed by the Canaanite pre decessors of Israel in Palestine, as well as by their Phoenician neighbors, and had been borrowed completely and seemingly with little or no modification by the Israelites as an integral part of the Canaanite agricultural civilization they assimilated. It employed the Canaanite-Phoenician month names. It took cog nizance of the fixed moments in the solar year, the equinoxes and the solstices,5 especially the former, and it celebrated the New Year's Day upon the day of the fall equinox, the first of the month Bui, and the Asif or Sukkot festival upon the seven days immediately preceding, the last seven days of the month Etanim and also the last seven days of the old year. It likewise celebrated the Passover at the new moon of the month Abib, just preceding the spring equinox, and the Mazzot festival during the week from Sunday through Saturday in which the spring equinox fell. It took cognizance likewise of the variable state of the crop in the different parts of the country, and fixed the dates of at least some of the important annual agricultural festivals in conformity therewith. Accordingly, this calendar may not have been strictly uniform in all details throughout the country; in other words, it may have been largely local, rather than national in character, at least so far as the dating of some of the festivals was concerned. Calendar II seems to have been a luni-solar calendar, based apparently upon Assyro-Babylonian models. It designated the months, not by name, as did Calendar I, but by number; nor, 6 That it was possible under the system of Calendar I to determine exactly the dates of the spring and fall equinoxes, 1 have shown conclusively in Mil. These were the two days in the year upon which the first rays of the rising sun shone straight through the eastern gate of the Temple at Jerusalem, opened for this specific moment, and down the long axis of the Temple into the דביר or holy of holies at its western end. This institution made it possible to deter mine the exact length of a solar year with almost mathematical precision; cf. below, note 110.</page><page sequence="6">6 JULIAN MORGEN STERN [6] as is almost self-understood, were the months in Calendar II identical with those of Calendar I either in duration or in moments of beginning. Moreover, Calendar II must have had some system of intercalation, of harmonization of the lunar and solar years, and one altogether different from that of Calendar I, if we may assume that the former, a purely solar calendar, had need of any system of lunar intercalation at all. Clearly Calendar II was an altogether different system of time-reckoning than Calendar I. Its introduction must have been due to three main causes: (1) the far-reaching influence of Assyro-Babylonian culture upon the life and religious practice of Israel throughout the seventh and the early portion of the sixth centuries B.C.; (2) the eager desire of the prophetic leaders of the Deuteronomic Reformation to rid the religious practice of Israel as completely as possible of non-Yahwistic, Canaanite and foreign religious influences and institutions, particularly such as were intimately bound up with the celebration of the great agricultural festivals, and especially those associated with the equinoxes and solstices;6 and (3) the urgent necessity, resulting from the centralization of the national worship in the sanctuary at Jerusalem, of having a unified, na tionalized calendar, officially authoritative and uniformly ob served throughout the entire land; for only with such a nation alized and invariable calendar could the observance of the three annual agricultural festivals by the entire nation at the central sanctuary and in the greatly modified and conventionalized man ner prescribed by the Deuteronomic reformers in Deut. 16. 1-17 be made possible. These considerations make it clear that the transition from Calendar I to Calendar II was definitely pur posed, sudden and complete, no doubt made possible by royal fiat, a transition which was evidently an integral part of a specific reformatory program. For these reasons, and also because of internal Biblical evidence as to the precise moment of this tran sition, it is impossible not to regard it as one of the necessary, practical, even though formally and officially unrecorded, steps in the far-reaching Deuteronomic Reformation. If we may regard the prescriptions for the observance of the « Cf. Mil.</page><page sequence="7">[7] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 7 three agricultural festivals in Deut. 16.1-17 as voicing the com plete Deuteronomic program for the festivals, then we may infer from its silence with regard thereto that it contemplated the total discontinuance of the old celebration of the New Year's Day upon the day of the fall equinox, and that it sought in general to abrogate tacitly the religious cognizance of the equi noctial and solstitial days because of the basically solar and non Yahwistic character of the essential festival rites connected with these days. It still, almost of necessity, retained the old tradi tional date of the Passover, viz., on the night of the new moon of Abib, and in this connection even retained the old month name from Calendar I, and also fixed the celebration of the Mazzot festival from the next morning on through a period of seven days, and the Shabuot festival fifty days after the "begin ning of putting the sickle to the standing grain," i. e., from the day of cutting the first sheaf of the new crop, a ceremony which was manifestly intimately associated with the Mazzot festival. But the Sukkot festival it dated, no longer as did the older codes,7 upon the last seven days of the year, but merely in the general way, at the time of gathering in the produce of the threshing floor and wine-press. But the evidence is clear that this Deuteronomic program did not succeed altogether, at least not permanently; that, even though the new designation of the months did supplant com pletely the older Canaanite month names, the old non-Yahwistic festivals and festival rites were not suppressed entirely, and that, at least in the period following almost immediately upon the death of Josiah in 608 B.c. and the accession of Jehoiakim to the throne, when the reaction against the rigid, uncompromising, iconoclastic program of the Deuteronomic Reformation set in, largely supported by the new king, the old festival observances were revived. So we find, for example, the old and extremely important ceremony of greeting the first rays of the rising sun upon the New Year's Day again observed in the Temple at Jerusalem.8 And now this New Year's Day, this day of the fall י Cf. note 2 ; also below, pp. 48 f. 8 Ezek. 8.16; 11.1-13; also cf. Mil, 31 ff., and also note 42 thereto, pp. 19-23.</page><page sequence="8">8 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [8] equinox, falls, under Calendar II, with its new system of desig nating the months, on VII/10.9 And correspondingly the Sukkot festival comes now during the seven days immediately preceding, upon VII/3-9.10 The relative moments in the solar year at which the festivals occur are practically the same under Calendar II as under Calendar I. But they come, quite naturally, upon dif ferent dates of the months of Calendar II than of those of Cal endar I. Clearly the Deuteronomic reformation of the calendar, drastic though it was, failed of its ultimate purpose, the com plete eradication from the approved and official cult of Yahweh of all objectionable, non-Yahwistic rites and ceremonies con nected with the observance of the festivals. Calendar III was, like Calendar II, apparently a luni-solar calendar. The transition to it from Calendar II, in contrast to that from Calendar I to Calendar II, seems to have been slow and gradual. The basic principles of the two Calendars, II and III, seem to have been at first much the same, although gradually a much more exact system of intercalation was apparently evolved for Calendar III, due no doubt to the necessity, which apparently grew steadily more urgent, of fixing the precise moments of the new and full moon occurrences and also of the festivals with reference thereto. Gradually too, though seemingly compara tively late, a new system of designating the months by names borrowed directly from the Babylonian calendar current in that age, instead of by number, as in Calendar II, evolved. This pro cess was so gradual that for a considerable time it was the not infrequent practice in the literature of the period to designate a date by the month number of Calendar II and then to equate it with the month name of Calendar III. It follows too that, with a gradually evolving different system of intercalation, the months of Calendar III must ultimately have come to differ from those of Calendar II in precise duration and consequently also in the moments at which they began. However, the main difference between Calendars II and III, at least in immediate effect, was not in the respective systems » » Ezek. 40.1; cf. Ml, 22 ff. » Cf. M4, 40 ff.</page><page sequence="9">[9] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 9 of intercalation and attendant circumstances, but in the relative order and dating of the main festivals. In Calendar II, as we have just seen, the Asif or Sukkot festival came on the last seven days of the year, from VII/3 through VII/9, with the New Year's Day celebrated upon VII/10, the day of the fall equinox. Actu ally, therefore, there were eight days of festival celebration, with the climax reached upon the eighth day, itself, however, not an integral part of the Sukkot festival proper. In Calendar III this condition has been altered completely. The New Year's Day has been transferred to VI1/1'. Sukkot, on the other hand, which originally preceded the New Year's Day, has been transferred to the full moon day of the seventh month, exactly two weeks after the New Year's Day, and is now celebrated for seven days, from VII/15 through VII/21. Apparently, however, the reminis cence persisted that originally there had been actually not seven, but eight, days of celebration in connection with the observance of the Sukkot festival. Accordingly, in time, and apparently fairly soon, an eighth, supplementary and rather colorless day of celebration was added to the original seven days of the festival, designated in quite nondescript manner as Shemini Azeret, and falling, of course, upon VII/22.11 However, another and even more significant reminiscence seems to have persisted in the mind, and no doubt in some form or other, even in the practice of the people, viz., that VII/10, the old fall equinoctial day, had been a day of most important ceremonial observance, upon which, among other things, much of the survival and good fortune of the people during the coming year depended.12 Many of the old rites and ceremonies of the New Year festival, originally observed upon this day, had been transferred, some, such as the blowing of the shofar to proclaim the beginning of the new year,13 to the New Year's Day upon » Cf. Ml, 77. 11 For the persistence into rabbinic times of the idea of Yom Kippur, i. e., VI1/10,VI1/10, as a day of prognostication by the high-priest of the fortunes of the people for the year iust begun, cf. Jer. Yoma, V, 42c (above); Bab. Yoma, 53b; Lev. Rabba, XX, 4. 13 And no doubt originally to ward off the demons and evil spirits which threatened particularly upon this critical day, and thus free the new year, to</page><page sequence="10">10 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [10] VII/1 VII/1, and others, such as the interesting equinoctial ceremonies of the Simhat Bet Haso'ebah, to the Sukkot festival five days later.14 Other rites and ceremonies, more or less integrally asso ciated with VII/10, such as the sending of the scapegoat into the wilderness15 and the dances of the maidens in the vineyards,16 continued apparently in folk-practice to be observed upon this day, no doubt despite the natural impulse of the priestly author ities, conscious of the non-Yahwistic origin and character of these rites, to suppress them. Ultimately, therefore, the religious sig nificance of VII/10 seems to have been officially reaffirmed; the rites peculiar to the day were given a Yahwistic veneer and sanction, and other rites of deep import, springing out of the basic principles of the Judaism of the day, were evolved, until eventually this old New Year's Day, reinterpreted now as Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement and of the ritual purification of sanctuary, priesthood and people, became the most holy day of the new religious calendar. This evolutionary process was naturally slow and gradual. Not until a comparatively late date did Yom Kippur take its full place in the festival scheme of Calendar III. Nor is it surprising that under Calendar III a transfer of date, similar to that of the Sukkot festival, should have been made with regard to the Passover-Mazzot festival. As we have learned, the Mazzot festival was originally celebrated, under Calendar I, during the week in which the spring equinox occur red, while the Passover, so far as it was celebrated generally at all17 during the period in which Calendar I was in vogue, fell an appreciable extent at least, of their malignant influence; cf. Finesinger, "Musical Instruments in the O.T.," HUCA, III (1926), 60; "The Shofar," HUCA,HUCA, VIII-IX (1931-1932), 193-228; also MOW J, 77 (1933), 244. 14 Cf. Mil, 20 f.; also Volz, Das Neujahrsfest Yahwes, 16, and Ml, 41. 16 Lev. 16.20-22. 16 Cf. M4. 1י In the Kenite Code (Ex. 34.14-26; cf. M7), it is clear, the Passover and Mazzot festivals are still totally unrelated, even though they must have occur red in very close time proximity to each other. Despite the fact that this Kenite Code has a distinct southern, pastoral background, the three agricultural festivals, of unmistakable Canaanite, non-Yahwistic origin, are accorded primary significance as annual religious institutions. On the other hand, de</page><page sequence="11">[11] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 11 upon the night of the new moon which preceded the spring equi nox. We have just seen too that the Deuteronomic reformers revived the old Passover at its old, traditional date on the night of the new moon of Abib, and accorded to it a primary signifi cance, while they relegated the Mazzot festival to a seemingly secondary position by linking it to the Passover and making its celebration begin on the morning following the night of the Pass over celebration. Manifestly, these Deuteronomic reformers must have shifted the date of the old Canaanite, agricultural festival from the traditional moment of its celebration, the week, Sunday through Saturday, in which the spring equinox fell, to the seven spite its ancient and undoubtedly still recognized pastoral, Yahwistic connec tions, the Passover seems to be relegated to a secondary position. There is in this code no direct prescription that it must be observed; instead there is only the rather incidental command that if and when observed, the characteristic Paschal sacrifice must not be allowed to remain over until morning. Apparently here in southern Palestine, under the influence of a steadily encroaching agri cultural civilization, and despite the reactionary, pastoral, or semi-pastoral program of the reformation in 899 B.C., whose platform this Kenite Code was, the tendency was for the Canaanite, agricultural Mazzot festival to sup plant the desert, Yahwistic Passover. In the code of the Book of the Covenant, of northern composition, and the platform of the reform movement headed by Elisha in 842 b.c., this tendency is even more pronounced. There the Passover seems to have disappeared com pletely. In the place of the specific Kenite legislation for the Paschal sacrifice the corresponding law in the younger code provides merely that the fat of the regular festal sacrifice shall not be permitted to remain over until morning. This law deals, not as does its antecedent in the Kenite Code, with the Paschal sacrifice specifically, but with festival sacrifices in general. Moreover, these festal sacrifices are all treated under the one, general head of ordinary זבחי שלמים, "peace-offerings," of which merely the fat had to be given to the deity, i. e., burned upon the altar, while the flesh of the animal was consumed entirely by the sacrificer and his guests. The Passover and its peculiar sacrifice are not considered at all in this younger code. Nor is this surprising, even despite the participation of the pastoral Rechabites in this reformation, when we remem ber the pronounced agricultural life and occupation which dominated the northern environment from which this code sprang. Manifestly the natural and easily comprehended tendency during the first six or seven centuries of Israel's sojourn in Palestine and its transformation from a semi-nomadic pastoral people to a settled, agricultural nation, was for the Passover to recede more and more into the background and eventually to disappear, while the Mazzot festival, celebrated at almost the same moment of the calendar year,</page><page sequence="12">12 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [12] days beginning on the morning following the new moon of Abib.18 This was its date in the earliest, purely Deuteronomic form of Calendar II. But under Calendar III the date of the combined Passover-Mazzot festival was shifted again, to the full moon of the first month, and the festival thus came eventually to be celebrated from the evening of 1/14 through 1/21. With this the original connection of the festival with the beginning of the harvest, still preserved, though seemingly rather loosely,1' in the Deuteronomic calendar, was necessarily severed, and the old and significant, agricultural rite of the solemn cutting and sacrifice as a taboo-offering of the first sheaf of the new crop upon the day following the close of the seven-day festival, in other words upon the eighth day,20 fell into apparent desuetude. With the increas ing domination of the Passover idea over that of the Mazzot festival, the beginning of which must be traced to the Deuter onomic Reformation, as we have seen, the rites of the seventh and concluding day of the festival proper ceased to be regarded as the most important elements of the festival celebration, and supplanted it in the folk-practice and likewise in the official religion of the people. This process, it is apparent, continued slowly but steadily until the Deuter onomic Reformation. Probably had it continued but a little longer, the Pass over would have disappeared completely. But, in accordance with their clearly defined program of eradicating, or at least of reducing to the absolute mini mum of recognition and practice, all elements of the then current national religion which were of unmistakably Canaanite, non-Yahwistic, origin and import, these Deuteronomic reformers resuscitated the old Passover, trans ferred the place of its observance to the central sanctuary, and with this, of course, transformed the ancient character of the Paschal sacrifice so that it now became a conventional "peace-offering" with them too, even though still offered during the night; and thereupon they shifted the date of the Mazzot festival to the morning after the night in which the Passover was observed, and thus made the agricultural Mazzot festival secondary to and dependent upon the pastoral Passover; cf. below, pp. 45 ff. In the course of this stud}' we shall see how the relation of these two festi vais, now permanently linked, and their dating were modified by the successive H and P legislators. 18 Cf. Deut. 16.7 f. with Lev. 23.6. 19 Cf. Deut. 16.9. » Cf. M5, 277 ff.</page><page sequence="13">[13] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 13 instead the primitive Passover ceremony upon the first night came to the fore and gave character and import to the entire festival. With this the eighth day, the "day after the Sabbath," too lost its original significance. Also, due no doubt to the per sistent reminiscence that the day following the celebration of the dominant rites of the festival had had its own peculiar sig nificance, the "day after the Passover"21 now usurped the place of the old eighth day, the "day after the Sabbath." However, no peculiar rites seem to have been observed upon it. It served now, just as the eighth day of the festival had served originally in part, merely as the day from which the counting of the fifty days until the Shabuot festival was begun. And with this there came of necessity, an eventual shifting of the date of this latter festival from the day upon which it had been celebrated under Calendars I and II, the fiftieth day after the close of the Mazzot festival, to the fiftieth day from the first day of the Passover festival as celebrated under Calendar III in its final form, as we shall see. This process, secondary as it was to the redating of the Passover festival, was extremely slow and gradual and ap parently was not completed until after the close of the Torah canon. These processes of the evolution of the calendar of ancient Israel during the biblical period have been established, or at least intimated, in previous papers. Moreover, it was shown that the principal record of Calendar III is found in the Priestly Code, that the older, pre-Exilic biblical writings know absolutely nothing of this Calendar, but know only Calendars I and II. It was likewise shown that Calendar II was observed still in the days of Ezekiel and even at the time of the reforms of Ezra and Nehemiah, that, in other words, the transition from Calendar II to Calendar III did not begin until in the period after Ezra and Nehemiah. Moreover, in certain, apparently late, secondary strata of P, and also in certain apocryphal books, notably I and II Macca bees, Enoch, and Jubilees,22 evidence is found of a calendar in 1ג Josh. 5.11; Num. 33.3; cf. below, pp. 95 ff. » Cf. M 1, 49-58.</page><page sequence="14">14 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [14] which the year seems to be reckoned, not from VII/1 but from 1/1. 1/1. The references to this, particularly in the biblical literature, are few and rather obscure, so that, in consequence, too far reaching conclusions may not be drawn from them. Nor is it at all certain that even though the calendars of Enoch and Jub ilees, on the one hand, and those of these secondary portions of P and I and II Maccabees, on the other, apparently reckoned the year from 1/1, that they were necessarily one and the same calendar. Of the calendar of Enoch and Jubilees considerable is known, viz., that it was a theoretical and conventional solar calendar of three hundred and sixty-four days to the year, div ided into four quarters, each consisting of three months of thirty days each plus one additional, intercalary day, not reckoned to any one month; each such quarter-year therefore consisted of ninety-one days or thirteen weeks. This calendar arrangement manifestly permitted the organization of the festal year in such manner that each of the festivals, with the single but significant exception of Yom Kippur, would begin upon a Sunday. More over, as is explicitly stated in Jubilees 6.23-38, this calendar was openly and aggressively non-lunar in character and was designed to combat the program of those contemporary ritual authorities who sought to adjust the festivals to the conditions of a basically lunar calendar, undoubtedly Calendar III. But whether this artificial and unreal solar calendar of Enoch and Jubilees was likewise the calendar of these secondary portions of P or of I and II Maccabees, is a question open to serious doubt. In all likelihood this calendar of Enoch and Jubilees was never actually observed; at least there is no definite evidence thereof. None the less the very fact that such a calendar could have been seri ously formulated, and that not as a mere personal vagary but as a conscious attempt to combat the introduction, or at least the continued use of Calendar III, with its lunar system of dating the festivals, shows the extreme importance attached by the religious authorities of the late biblical and early post-biblical periods to the entire question of the calendar, and therefore justifies renewed and persistent investigation. In this particular study our primary task will be to deter mine, so far as this is possible, the time of the transition from</page><page sequence="15">[15] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 15 Calendar II to Calendar III and the causes which brought about this transition. We shall see that they were considerations of far-reaching importance, which had a significant bearing upon the evolution of Judaism in the late biblical period. But in the investigation of this general theme a number of specific prob lems will require particular and minute examination: (1) the time of the transition from the reckoning of the day as beginning with morning to the reckoning of it as beginning with evening; (2) the calendar of the Holiness Code; and (3) the calendar or calendars of the Priestly Code. II The Moment of Beginning the Day This question has been considered carefully by Konig,23 and he has made a fairly good case for the conclusion that in the earlier calendar and in the literature which records this the day was reckoned from the morning, presumably from sunrise, while in the later calendar and the literature pertaining thereto the day was reckoned from the evening. He bases this conclusion prim arily upon the oft-recurring phrase yom walaylah, in which the word yom, "day," precedes laylah, "night,"24 upon an interpréta tion of Gen. 1, and particularly of the enumeration of the six days of creation in vv. 5b, 8b, 13, 19, 23, 31b, an interpretation, however, which, as we shall see conclusively, is forced and false, and finally upon the unmistakable import of the prescription in Lev. 7.15, and 22.30, that the todah-sacrifice must be eaten upon the day upon which it is sacrificed, and that nothing of it must be allowed to remain over until morning. Obviously the implica tion here is that the, next morning is no longer a part of the day upon which the sacrifice was offered, but marks the beginning of the second day; had the day been thought here to begin with the evening, then the command that the sacrifice must be com pletely consumed upon the very day of its offering would have concluded with the injunction that nothing must be allowed to remain over until evening. The evidence of this statement is 23 Op. cit., 605-612. 24 Although he Recognizes numerous variants from this expression.</page><page sequence="16">16 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [16] unmistakable and irrefutable. Actually, it is the only convincing bit of evidence which Kônig presents; but it alone suffices to prove his contention. However, it is possible to enlarge this evidence in manifold and extremely significant manner. Elsewhere25 we have presented quite a mass of evidence which establishes conclusively that the earlier practice in Israel during the biblical period was to reckon the day from sunrise to sunrise, and that the later practice of reckoning the day from sunset to sunset or from evening to evening is definitely attested only in late secondary passages of the Priestly Code and in still later writings. Accordingly, we ventured to suggest, though at the time rather hesitatingly, the then seemingly radical hypothesis, that this system of reckoning the day could not have been introduced into Jewish practice until comparatively quite late in the biblical period, certainly not before the fourth century b.c., and that this must have been upon the authorization of the Soferim or the "Men of the Great Synod." We correlated this radical modification of the earlier system of calendation with the introduction of a basically lunar system of time-reckoning. For it is almost self-apparent that a lunar system of time-reckoning would necessarily assume a day extending from sunset to sunset, whereas a solar system of time-reckoning, such as Calendar I was, or even a luni-solar system which evolved out of a purely solar system, such as was the case with Calendar II, would naturally reckon the day from sunrise to sunrise. But this consideration would imply in turn that this transition from the earlier to the later system of reckon ing the day must be correlated in some way with the introduction of Calendar III, or at least with one of the significant stages in the evolution of this Calendar. The determination of the correct ness of this assumption, and with it the attempt to fix as precisely as possible the moment at which this change in the system of reckoning the day was introduced into Jewish practice, must constitute our next specific task. That in the earliest period of Israelite sojourn in Palestine, under Calendar I, the day was reckoned from morning to morn 26 M 6, 176-179.</page><page sequence="17">[17] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 17 ing is established by a superabundance of evidence. In Jud. 6.37-38 the dew falls upon the exposed fleece, of course, during the night. Then "when Gideon arose on the morrow," etc. Clearly here the night still belongs to the preceding day and the new day begins only with the morning. Similarly, in Jud. 19.6-9, the fifth day seems to begin with the morning, when the people rise up for the day's activities; and this is clearly implied in v. 9. Unmis takable is the import of I Sam. 19.11. The servants of Saul sur round the house in which David is sojourning with Michal, Saul's daughter, waiting to kill him in the morning. She warns her husband, "If you do not rescue yourself tonight, then tomorrow you will be killed." Likewise, in I Sam. 28. 8, 19, 25, Saul comes to the house of the witch of Endor during the night and finally departs while it is still night. The ghost of Samuel, summoned during the interval, i. e., while it is still night, says to Saul, "Tomorrow thou and thy sons will be with me"; and while it is not explicitly so stated, the manifest implication is that the Battle of Mt. Gilboa, in which Saul and his sons meet their death, precisely as the ghost of Samuel had announced, occurs the very next day. In Jud. 21.2-4 the army of Israel sit before Yahweh until the evening and mourn and weep and make supplication, presumably all through the night. But "on the morrow, when they arose," etc. Here, too, apparently the new day was thought to begin with the morning. This too is the implication of the narrative in I Sam. 5.2-4, that the Philistines set up the ark in the Dagon temple at Ashdod in the presence of the image of their god; "but when they arose on the next day and came to their temple," etc. Clearly the thought here is that during the night the temple of Dagon was closed, or at least no one was present in it, and during this period of absence of all human beings the contest for supremacy between Yahweh and Dagon and the final triumph of Yahweh took place, so that in the mor ning on the morrow, etc. Also in Gen. 19.34, the older daughter of Lot, after sleeping with her father during the night, says to her sister on the next day, etc.; here too the night belongs to the preceding day and the new day begins with the next morning. This too seems to be the implication of Ex. 19.16; I Sam. 11.9-11 ; II Sam. 24.13-15, and Num. 11.32, although the conclusion here</page><page sequence="18">18 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [18] may not be drawn with quite the same certainty as in the pas sages previously cited. With the possible exception of this last passage, all the passages here listed reflect the practice of reck oning the day from morning to morning during the period when Calendar I was in vogue. Likewise, if we interpret Lev. 19.13b in connection with the parallel and closely related legislation in Deut. 24.14-15, we are forced to conclude that even as late as the Holiness Code and secondary strata of Deuteronomy26 the day was still reckoned as beginning with the morning. This conclusion is strikingly con firmed by the dating of the Passover in Lev. 23.5-6.27 This pro vides that the Passover festival, still clearly distinguished from, although celebrated in conjunction with the Mazzot festival, should be observed during the night of 1/14, while the celebration of the Mazzot festival should begin on the fifteenth and continue for seven days.28 Manifestly, here too, in a passage which is actually not H but P or RP, the day still begins with the morning. This is stated even more explicitly in another passage from P, Num. 33.3. There the exodus from Egypt took place upon 1/15, upon the "day after the Passover."29 Here, obviously, the term פסח sums up all the incidents recounted in the P stratum of Ex. 12 as transpiring during the night preceding the exodus. This was the night of 1/14; the next morning was 1/15. The significant fact brought out by the evidence presented in this last paragraph is that the practice of reckoning the day as beginning with the morning, the antiquity and primacy of which were sufficiently established by the evidence cited in the 26 The evidence of the secondary character and early post-Exilic date of Deut. 24.14-15 is contained in my "The Book of the Covenant," Part IV (still(still(still unpublished). 27 However, that these vv. are P, and not H, will be developed later. 28 This is also the obvious implication of the prescription in Deut. 16.7, that, after offering the Paschal sacrifice at the central sanctuary during the night of the new moon of Abib, the people return to their homes the next morning. There they eat mazzot, i. e., celebrate the Mazzot festival, for seven days (v. 3). (For the late, editorial character of v. 8, with its seemingly con tradictory statement that the mazzot shall be eaten for only six days and that upon the seventh day there shall be an עצרת, cf. below, note 100). 25 So also Josh. 5.11.</page><page sequence="19">[19] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 19 preceding paragraph, persisted well into the post-exilic period, i. e., into the period when Calendar II was in vogue, and found definite and unmistakable record, not only in Pt,30 but also in ( P or RP. This last fact is of extreme significance in that it enables us to interpret Gen. 1 correctly. As has been said, the importance of the narrative of Gen. 1 for this particular problem was clearly perceived by Kbnig. He argued, and undoubtedly correctly, that in vv. 14, 16, and 18 the mention of the day before the night and also the statement that the sun was made prior to the moon imply that the narrative of creation proper must have regarded the light part of the day as preceding the dark part and the day therefore as beginning with the morning. He might have added that this too must be the implication of the motif that creation, and therefore with it existence and time and time-reckoning, begin with the appearance of light from amidst the primeval and timeless darkness. He erred grievously, however, in attempting to force the interpretation of w. 5b, 8b, 13, 19, 23, and 31, "And it was evening, and it was morning, x-day," into agreement with this interpretation. If from the facts that in vv. 14, 16 and 18 the reference to the day precedes that to the night and that the sun is said to have been created prior to the moon Konig may conclude that the creation narrative proper regarded the day as beginning with the morning, then, by the same line of reasoning, the mention of the evening before the morning in vv. 5b, etc. should indicate that to the author of these verses the day was reckoned as beginning in the evening; and this all the more so since, as Konig himself clearly י establishes, the reckoning of the day from evening to evening did come eventually to be the general practice in Israel. Unques tionably Konig is wrong in his interpretation of these vv. Appa rently the concept of a day in vv. 5b, 8b, 13, 19, 23, and 31, reckoned from evening to evening, contradicts absolutely the concept of a day, reckoned from morning to morning, which seems to be basic to vv. 14, 16, and 18, and in fact to the entire creation narrative proper. The solution of this perplexing prob lem must be sought in a different direction. י Lev. 7.15 and presumably also 22.30.</page><page sequence="20">20 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [20] In the afore-mentioned article on "The Sources of the Créa tion Story—Genesis 1:1-2:4", we endeavored to show that the creation story in Gen. 1.1-2.4 is really a composite of two related but basically contradictory versions of the creation story. Both versions in their literary form are from P, but manifestly from different strata of P, and the products of different periods and of divergent theologies. The older of the two narratives told of creation by divine fiat. Yahweh merely spoke His divine word, "Let there be," and it was just as He had purposed it. Creation in this manner is technically designated by the verb ברא. Appar ently creation by divine fiat proceeded in eight successive steps or stages, but impliedly the entire process transpired at one time, on one day as we might say.31 The basic theological con cept here is obviously that of a supreme, transcendental Deity, altogether devoid of anthropomorphic features, who does not need to fashion things through physical labor, but merely speaks His all-powerful, divine word, and things come into being, pre cisely as He had planned. In this first version of the creation story the time concept is of no significance whatever. The second version of the creation story is only fragmentary, but its main features can be easily discerned. In it the Deity fashions things through physical labor. The verb describing this procedure is characteristically עשה and the activity itself is מלאכה, "work." The Deity labors with His hands and impliedly wearies Himself with His labors. Creation in this manner extends over a a period of six days and by the advent of the seventh day is fully completed.32 Accordingly the Deity ceases from work on the seventh day and rests thereon,33 and He blesses this day and consecrates it for the observance of men. Unmistakably in this second version of the creation story the basic consideration is not the theological concept of an anthropomorphic Deity who, in contrast to the concept fundamental to the first version, labors with His hands and wearies Himself in so doing and must there 31 This consideration may perhaps supply the explanation of the otherwise difficult ביום in 2.4b, even though it is coupled with the verb עשה, and not ברא. 32 Accordingly, 2.2 must be rendered, "And God had completed upon the seventh day His work, which He had made," etc. 33 Ex. 20.11, וינח.</page><page sequence="21">[21] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 21 fore seek rest and refreshment at the close of His labors, but it is rather the institution of the Sabbath. The picture of the Deity working physically for six days and then ceasing from work and resting on the seventh day is merely the motivation for the institution of the Sabbath. But it needs only a moment's thought to make perfectly plain that the enumeration of the six successive days, in w. 5b, 8b, 13, 19, 23, and 31b, is merely preparatory to the account in 2.1-3 of the institution of the Sabbath upon the seventh day. This is borne out by the fact, oft commented upon by scholars, that the account of creation in six days neces sitates the illogical crowding of two acts of creation upon each of the third and sixth days in order to bring the eight stages of creation of Version I into the scheme of creation in six days of Version II. The basic contradictions between and the relative independence of the two versions of the creation story in Gen. 1.1-2.4 are beyond all question. But it is clear that v,14a at least,34 in which we have the first mention of day before night, as well as the motif that creation, existence and time began with the emergence at divine command of light out of primeval, time less darkness, coupled with their implication that the day commenced with the appearance of light, and therefore with the morning, belong to Version I, while the enumeration of the six days of creation from evening to evening belongs to Version II.35 These considerations establish conclusively the extremely significant fact that Pg still reckoned the day from morning to morning. This too is, as we have seen, the testimony of Lev. 23.5-6 and Num. 33.3. On the other hand, P2, or at least some secondary passages of P, reckoned the day from evening to eve ning. It follows therefore, with practical certainty, that the transition in the reckoning of the day from the earlier practice of from morning to morning to the later practice of from evening to evening, took place at a relatively late date, some time after 34 For the secondary character of vv. 14b, 16-18a, cf. M 6, 180 ff. 35 In 1920, when the article in question was written, I was not yet fully aware of the significance of the transition from the older to the younger system of reckoning the day. But the evidence presented in this study furnishes addi tional and strong confirmation of the analysis of the creation story in Gen. 1.1-2.4 there offered.</page><page sequence="22">22 julian morgenstern [22] the composition of Pg, and perhaps even after the composition of early 'secondary portions of P, in other words not before the beginning of the fourth century b.c.36 36 The certain terminus ad quem, by which time this new system of reckon ing the day from evening to evening was firmly established, is fixed by Esth. 4.15 with its reckoning of "three days, night and day," (cf. Lev. 8.35; Num. 9.21 [both passages P]), and by Dan. 8.14, with its term ערב ב&lt;ןר meaning a full day, as the first half of the second century b.c. We shall, however, in the course of this investigation be able to determine the date of this transition much more exactly. One biblical passage might seem at first glance to refute this conclusion, viz., Neh. 13.19-21. This reads, "Now when the gates of Jerusalem began to be darkened before the Sabbath, and I commanded, and they closed the doors, then I commanded that they should not open them until after the Sabbath, and some of my soldiers 1 stationed at the gates, so that no traffic might enter upon the Sabbath day. So the peddlers and sellers of all kinds of merchandise remained outside of Jerusalem over night once and a second time. Then 1 warned them and said to them; Why do you lodge over night just outside the wall? If you do it again, I will use force against you. From that time on they never came again upon the Sabbath." Here, it might seem at first glance, the night preceding the Sabbath is a part of the Sabbath day. And were this con elusion correct, it would establish with certainty that already by 432 B. c. the day was reckoned as beginning with the evening, and thus our thesis that this modification was introduced at least a century and a half later would be overthrown. Careful examination of the passage, however, shows that no such implication is necessarily inherent in the passage, and that actually it gives not the slightest indication whether it reckoned the day from evening to eve ning or from morning to morning. V. 19 does not say at all that Nehemiah com manded that the gates be closed in order to compel the observance of the Sab bath. LTndoubtedly the gates were closed every night. The verse says merely that when the gates were closed on that particular Friday night, Nehemiah commanded that they be not opened until after the close of the Sabbath. Inasmuch as the gates, had they been opened on Saturday morning, as had obviously been the practice up to this moment, would have been closed again on Saturday night, Nehemiah's command actually meant that the gates should not be opened at all on Saturday, nor until Sunday morning dawned. Accord ingly the gates were kept closed from Friday evening to Sunday morning. But this offers not the slightest clue whether in Nehemiah's time the Sabbath, and with this, of course, the day in general, was reckoned from evening to evening or from morning to morning. On the basis of this passage there is therefore no reason at all to question our conclusion that still in Nehemiah's time the day was reckoned from morning to morning, and not yet from evening to evening.</page><page sequence="23">[23] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 23 In this connection one further consideration of extreme im portance. As we have seen, Lev. 23.5-6 fixes the celebration of the Passover upon the night of 1/14, but the beginning of the Mazzot festival upon the next day, explicitly called 1/15. The same dating is recorded in Num. 28.16-25. Likewise Num. 33.3, and with it by unmistakable implication Josh. 5.10, fix the Pass over upon the fourteenth but the beginning of the Mazzot festi val, marked, of course, by the eating of Mazzot, upon the next day, the fifteenth. A seven-day festival which began upon 1/15 would run through 1/21 and end only with the completion of that day. But Ex. 12, in addition to providing in v. 6 for the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb on 1/14 in the evening, likewise prescribes very specifically in v. 18 that the people shall begin to eat Mazzot on the evening of the fourteenth, in other words coincidentally with the Paschal sacrifice, and shall continue to eat them for seven days until the evening of 1/21. Manifestly here the twenty-first is no longer the final day of the Mazzot festival. This festival comes to an end now with the close of the twentieth. As we have seen, the entire P section of Ex. 12 re gards the day as beginning with the evening, and accordingly it dates the Mazzot festival, not as does the earlier P legislation, from the morning of the fifteenth through the entire twenty-first, i. e. to the morning of the twenty-second, but it must of necessity move this festival up one half day and make it commence with the beginning of the day basic to its cultural institutions, i. e. in the evening preceding, the evening of the fourteenth. This compels, or at least enables, it to identify the beginning of the Mazzot festival with the Passover proper instead of holding them distinct and apart, although in immediate juxtaposition, as the earlier P legislation did. That this is, in part at least, the specific purpose of the legislation in Ex. 12.18, and likewise that this is an innovation, a conscious and purposed departure from the older practice of commencing the Mazzot festival on the morning after the peculiar Passover rites were celebrated, is evidenced by the extreme punctiliousness with which the festival is dated here. Unquestionably Lev. 23.5-6; Num. 28. 16-25; 33.3, and Josh. 5.10 record the older practice and belong to older strata of P2. Moreover, this older practice of P2 is in effect identical</page><page sequence="24">24 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [24] with that prescribed in Deut. 16.7. Obviously Ex. 12.18 and with it no doubt the whole of the P stratum in Ex. 12 belong to a quite late stratum of P2.37 This conclusion is fully borne out by one other important consideration. We have just seen that Lev. 23.5-6; Num.28.16 25; 33.3 and Josh. 5.10, which fix the beginning of the Mazzot festival upon 1/15, i. e., as we have seen, from the morning of the fifteenth on, belong to older strata of P2. We have seen too that this dating of the festival represents a shift from the moment in the month at which the festival was celebrated originally, viz., at the new moon of the month of Abib. Furthermore, we have concluded that this shift was due to a definite purpose on the part of the revisers of the calendar, to link the beginning of the festival with the full moon day of the month rather than with the new moon day, as originally. This same consideration, in part at least, must have motivated the shifting of the date of the Sukkot festival from VII/3-9, as celebrated originally, to VI1/15-21. Thus the beginning of the Sukkot festival also was made to coincide with the full moon.38 The actual process of this shift is self-apparent. Theoretically it could have been made in two directions, either backward, to make the day now begin with the evening preceding the morning of its former commencement, or forward to make the day now begin with the evening following its former commencement. But 3ז Cf. M 1, 62 f. To this same relatively late portion of the biblical period a a number of additional biblical passages must be assigned, in which the day is obviously represented as beginning with the evening. The classical passage, the import of which is unmistakable, is, of course, Lev. 23.32 (cf. below, pp. 7474 f.). Kônig {op. cit., 608 f.) has cited a number of such passages, viz., Deut. 1.33; 28.66; Is. 27.3; 34.10; Ps. 55.18; 91.5; 104.19; Esth. 4.16. To this list should be added Ex. 16.6, 13 (from other, internal evidence it isclear that the whole of Ex. 16.4-36 belongs to a very late, secondary stratum of P; cf. below, note 138); I Ki. 8.29; Ps. 30.6; and especially Ezek. 45.21-25. (cf. below, note 166). 38 A further stage in this process of associating the festivals with the full moon day may be seen in the attempt of the author of Jubilees to fix the Sha buot festival also upon 111/15 (cf. M 2, 87-100), an attempt all the more sig nificant since, under the conditions of the artificial calendar of Jubilees, Sha buot should have fallen upon III/ll, and could not possibly fall upon 111/15.</page><page sequence="25">[25] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 25 a basic, practical consideration naturally determined the direc tion of the shift, viz., that it must be backward. The primary reason for the shift must have been to identify the beginning of the festivals more precisely with the exact day of the full moon. A synodic lunar month consists of approximately twenty-nine and a half days.39 Accordingly the exact moment of the fullness of the moon would come approximately fourteen and three quarter days after the moment of the appearance of the new moon, i. e., regularly upon the fifteenth day of the lunar month, but, of course, with the day reckoned from evening to evening, with the evening of the day of the new moon marking the begin ning of the first day of the month. Concretely stated this means that what was under Calendar II, and likewise still under Cal endar III in its early stages, the night of the fourteenth of the month, and the second half of that full day of twenty-four hours, now, under Calendar III in its second stage of evolution, became the first half of the fifteenth of the month. The day now began a half day earlier than had been the case formerly. That this was the actual process of the shift is amply attested. Lev. 23.32b, manifestly a very late editorial addition to the legislation for Yom Kippur, which itself, as we have seen, was none too early, dates the celebration of this holy day with exact precision, "on the ninth of the month, at evening, from evening to evening." Now it is certain that this did not mean to imply at all that the festival was actually celebrated on the ninth of the month, for the statement in v. 27 is explicit, that it was to be observed upon the tenth. As we have seen, the original Yom Kippur legislation dealt with a day which extended from morn ing to morning. Accordingly it legislated by implication for Yom Kippur to be celebrated from morning to morning. V. 32b mani festly seeks to fix the exact period of the festival according to the new system of reckoning the day. Therefore it provides that the sacred day shall now be observed, no longer from morning to morning, but, moved backward a half day, from evening to evening, i. e., it shall begin on what had been under the former 35 Cf. Ginzel, Handbuch der mathematischen u. technischen Chronologie, I, 36.</page><page sequence="26">26 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [26] system of reckoning the day the evening of the ninth, the latter half of the ninth, but which is now, under the new system of reckoning the day, the tenth, the first half of the tenth. Actually Yom Kippur is still observed, under the new reckoning of the day, only upon the tenth, precisely as v. 27 specifies. But the tenth now varies by a half day from what it had been previously, Precisely the same is the import of Ex. 12.18. There the date of the now completely fused Passover-Mazzot festival is given as 1/14 to 1/21, i. e., through 1/20, from the evening of 1/14 to the evening of 1/21. On the surface it would seem as if this most explicit dating of the festival defeats its very end, for it seems to provide that the festival should begin on the fourteenth, one day earlier than the full moon day. But such is not actually the case. Precisely as does Lev. 23.32b, it enumerates the days of the month in terms of the older system of reckoning the day. It has, as we have seen, moved the moment of beginning the Mazzot festival backward by a half day and thus synchronized it with the celebration of the Passover ceremony. And, as we have seen, under the older system of reckoning the day this had been the night of the fourteenth, the second half of that calendar day. But actually the night which had been then the second half of the fourteenth calendar day of the month has now become the first half of the fifteenth calendar day; and actually the festival is now celebrated, just as it has continued to be cele brated in the official calendar of Judaism, from the fifteenth through the twenty-first of the month. It is obvious that through its very effort to fix the time of the celebration of the now com pletely fused Passover-Mazzot festival with exact precision, due, of course, to the paramount importance of the specific Passover rites on the veiy first night of the fused festival, the editors of Ex. 12.18 have caused extreme confusion in the dating of the festival, as we shall see in a moment. Perhaps this very confusion might have been avoided had they not sought, for the sake of precision, to date the festival, under the new order of reckoning the day, in terms of the old order. Precisely the same procedure must have taken place with the Sukkot festival, even though it is nowhere specifically recorded. Whereas it had formerly begun on the morning of the fifteenth</page><page sequence="27">[27] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 27 and continued, through the twenty-first, to the morning of the twenty-second, it now begins upon the evening preceding the moment of its former beginning and concludes upon the evening preceding its former conclusion; in other words, its entire cele bration too has been moved backward by a half day. But what was formerly the evening of the fourteenth of the month is now the beginning of the fifteenth. Accordingly the dating of the Sukkot festival remains precisely the same under the new system of reckoning the day as it had been under the old, viz., from the fifteenth through the twenty-first. Confusion is avoided, how ever, because in this case late P2 editors did not attempt to define the period of festival celebration precisely by dating it in terms of the former system of reckoning the day, as they did with Yom Kippur and with the Passover-Mazzot festival. Returning for a moment to the consideration of Ex. 12.18 and the confusion caused by its attempt to date the completely fused Passover-Mazzot festival precisely, it is noteworthy that Jubilees 49. 1,10-12,15 fixes the time for the performance of the Passover rite in a peculiar manner. Manifestly it seeks to har monize the statement in Ex. 12.18, coupled with the provisions in vv. 6 and 8 of the same chapter, that the Paschal lamb should be slaughtered upon the fourteenth, ב,[ הערבים, and should be eaten during this same night, with the seemingly conflicting practice of Judaism of performing all these rites upon the fif teenth. Obviously it does not realize that this seeming confusion has been brought about by the introduction of a new system of reckoning the day. Accordingly it seeks to hold fast to both the biblical dating and the established practice by legislating that the animal should be prepared and slaughtered at some time within the last two thirds of the daylight half of the fourteenth, i. e., during the last eight hours preceding sunset and the close of the day, but that the animal should be eaten only after sunset during the first third of the night half of the fifteenth, i. e., during the first four hours of the first half of that day. Thus it conforms, at least formally, to the prescriptions of Ex. 12.6, 8, and 18 as well as to established Jewish practice. The artificial interpréta tion which it puts upon the rather vague and uncertain biblical term, בין הערבים, makes this scheme of celebration possible. And</page><page sequence="28">28 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [28] that this was not mere theoretical legislation is evidenced by the fact that this is the precise ceremonial practice of the Samaritans today.40 But the very fact that the authors of Jubilees should feel themselves constrained to attempt to harmonize the biblical dating of the festival with established Jewish practice in this manner, even though they were no longer aware of the true cause of the confusion, may well indicate that the change in the system of reckoning the day, from evening to evening instead of from morning to morning, had transpired at a date not too long before the composition of Jubilees,41 and that the official practice of Judaism of celebrating the festival from 1/15 through 1/21 was as yet not too firmly established to permit a divergent theory and practice with regard to the precise time when the festival should be celebrated. This in turn, together with other important considerations, would point to a time approximately about the beginning or the first half, of the third century B.C. as that of the introduction of the new system of reckoning the day.42 40 Cf. Lindner, "Die Passahfeier der Samaritaner auf dem Berge Garizim," PJB,PJB, VIII (1913), 104-120; Dalman, "Das samaritanische Passah im Ver hàltniss zum jiidischen," ibid., 121-138; J.

T., II, 6 f.) fixes the date of Jubilees as 109-105 b.c. 42 Confirmation of this conclusion may be found in the fact that II Chron. 35.17 still distinguishes between the Passover and the Mazzot festivals, even though it deals apparently with the completely fused Passover-Mazzot festival under the general name, Pesah, the beginning of which it fixes upon the night of 1/14 (cf. w. 1, 18). This seems to imply that the old distinction between the Passover and the Mazzot festivals, of deep significance in the former period when they were merely juxtaposed but still independent festivals, was being outgrown, but had not yet been completely obliterated by the time of the Chronicler, i. e., about 300 b.c. On the other hand, the detailed account of the celebration of the second Passover in II Chron. 30 (cf. below, pp. 98 ff.) indicates conclusively that by the time of the Chronicler the actual fusion of the two festivals was already an accomplished fact. The true implication of II. Chron. 35.17 therefore seems to be that this fusion, in its final, official stage, was a development still so recent that a clear reminiscence of the older relation of the two festivals to each other still persisted in the writings of the Chronicler. This, in turn, would point to a time about 300 B.c., or perhaps just a trifle</page><page sequence="29">[29] the CALENDARS OF ANCIENT israel 29 III The Calendar of H One point in regard to the calendar of H we have already dis cussed,43 viz., the import of Lev. 25.9, and have concluded from this that in the festival calendar of H the New Year's Day must have been celebrated still upon VII/10, precisely as in the period following immediately upon the introduction of Calendar II in connection with the Deuteronomic Reformation, and as is rec orded likewise in Ezek. 40.1.44 However, it is possible to learn considerably more about the calendar of H from a careful analysis of those portions of Lev. 23 which are usually ascribed to H. The subjoined table records various analyses of Lev. 23 by leading biblical scholars during the last forty years. earlier, but none the less in all likelihood well within the Greek period, for the moment of the official fusion of the Passover and Mazzot festivals. « Cf. M 1, 27 f. •י« So also Bertholet, Commentary to Leviticus (Marti, Hand Kommentar series), 89. A moment's thought shows that it would have been surprising in deed had either Ezekiel or H fixed the New Year's Day upon any date other than VII/10. For whatever date we may assign to Ezek. 40.1 and Lev. 25.9, it can hardly be sufficiently long after the introduction of Calendar II, at the time of the Deuteronomic Reformation, to permit the assumption of the intro duction of Calendar III and the shifting of the date of the New Year's Day from VII/10 to VII/1. Manifestly a reorganization of the calendar as drastic as this would require the lapse of a fairly considerable period of time and a radical change of religious background and aim. We shall see that just these conditions did bring about the transition from Calendar II to Calendar III. But these considerations make it practically certain that this transition could not have followed all too soon upon the introduction of Calendar II. And since we may not presume that a period of more than three quarters of a century at the most elapsed between the composition of Ezek. 40.1 (assuming that this verse is the work of the prophet himself), and Lev. 25.9 (and even granting that this verse may be, not HI, but H2), it follows that even without the explicit statement of Lev. 25.9 we would naturally conclude that in the cal endar of H the New Year's Day was still observed upon VII/10. In this connection it is interesting to note that the Talmud (Abod. Zar., 9b; Arak. 12a) recognizes that VII/10 was actually the New Year's Day. Rashi explains this statement of the Talmud in a forced manner by saying that only upon Yom Kippur, the tenth day after the official New Year's Day on VII/1, did it become perfectly clear that this was the Jubilee year, because upon this day the shofar was blown and Jewish slaves returned to their homes and fields reverted to their former owners.</page><page sequence="30">[30] 30־ ' JULIAN MORGENSTERN Holzinger (Kautz8eh, Die Heilige Schrift des des A.

Yet some of the minor divergences between them are of more than passing significance. The majority of these scholars are a unit in assigning w. 10a/3-12 to H. Carpenter and Harford and apparently Holzinger also assign the whole of v. 12 to H. Haller, on the other hand, assigns the whole of v. 12 to Rp and retains only vv. 10a/3-ll (- לרצונכם) for H. The following considerations will not only substantiate this conclusion, but will also establish that for cogent reasons all passages in this chapter which prescribe ani mal sacrifices can not be from H, but must be assigned to P or RP. It is impossible to separate the statement of the sacrifice in v. 12b from its supplement in v. 13. This Baentsch has seen correctly and accordingly has assigned merely v. 12a to H, no doubt with the implication that the provision for the sacrifice in vv. 12b-13, which he correctly assigns to P, has supplanted an older H prescription for a sacrifice, probably of simpler char acter and content. Actually, however, there is not the slightest evidence that such was ever the case. The use of ועשיתם in v. 12a parallels exactly that of the very same verb in v. 19. Likewise the prescription that sacrificial animals must in specific cases be yearlings, is found only in P. The mere reference to the "wav ing" of the first sheaf in v. 12a may just as well be editorial as original. There is consequently not the slightest reason for sep arating v. 12 from v. 13, nor yet for separating v. 12a from vv. 12b-13. The two verses constitute a unit, prescribing a single and simple sacrifice, entirely after the P pattern, and are un mistakably P. Moreover, the only other passage in the chapter which deals with animal sacrifice which modern scholars assign to H, is vv. 18-20. The table of analyses of the chapter will show that here too there is some diversity of opinion about the unity of these two verses and their assignment to H. Only Carpenter and Harford assign the whole of these two verses to H, even though they do ad mit that there are traces here of P editorial handiwork. Driver and White assign 18a/3-ba, 19a and 20ay to P, but retain the remain</page><page sequence="32">32 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [32] der for H. Baentsch, Haller and Holzinger agree in retaining only vv. 18a and 19b for H, though they differ from each other slightly in their analysis and distribution of v. 20. This last mat ter is, however, of minor significance, as we shall see. But not only are the language of vv. 18-19 in their entirety and the pattern of the sacrifice prescribed in these two verses in every way characteristic of P, but also the details of this sacrifice agree so completely with that prescribed for this very same occasion in Num. 28.27-31, even though the order in which the animals are listed varies slightly, that there can be no question that we have here merely two variant records of one and the same sacri fice, both of course by P.4S At first sight it may appear that Num. 28.27-31 makes no provision for the sacrifice of the two yearling lambs mentioned in Lev. 23.19b, and that this provision seems therefore to be peculiar to the prescription for the sacrifice in Lev. 23.18-19, and therefore presumably to be H. But this is a superficial con elusion. Not only does the specification that these lambs must be yearlings suggest that this passage too must be P, but also it should take but a moment's thought to make perfectly clear, after considering Num. 28.31, supplemented by vv. 3-4 of the same chapter, that the two yearling lambs of Lev. 23.19b are the two yearling lambs of the daily sacrifice provided for in Num. 28.31. Accordingly Lev. 23.19b, and with it, of course, not only v. 18a but likewise the references to the two lambs in v. 20a, must also be P or RP.46 « The only significant divergence between the two accounts is that Num. 28.27 prescribes two steers and one goat while Lev. 23.18 prescribes one steer and two goats. 46 The presence of an editorial hand in v. 20a is self-evident. It is not clear just what the antecedent of אתם can be. The words, על לחם הבכרים, suggest that אתם refers back to the two lambs of v. 19b. But, on the one hand, this conclu sion is contradicted by the specification, על שני כבשים (we should expect הכבשים) at the end of v. 20a, and, on the other hand, v. 19 states specifically that the two lambs constituted the "peace-offering"; therefore they could not possibly have constituted the "wave-offering" or a part thereof simultaneously. V.17 states specifically that the loaves, made of the first-fruits of various kinds of grain which had ripened since the cutting of the first sheaf, alone constituted the "wave-offering." But in v. 20a the specification, על לחם הבכרים, is confusing if we would interpret אתם as referring to the first-fruits.</page><page sequence="33">[33] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 33 The import of all this is of great moment. It is that the entire H program for the ritual observance of the festivals, so far as it is preserved in Lev. 23, makes no provision whatever for ani mal sacrifice of any kind nor gives the slightest hint that any such sacrifice was contemplated by the H legislators for their scheme of festival observance. It might, of course, be argued that we have actually only a fragment of the original complete H legislation for the festival observance, and that undoubtedly considerable portions thereof have been suppressed by P editors in favor of their own scheme of festival observance with its detailed sacrificial ritual, and that in consequence it was in all likelihood just those sacrificial portions of the original H festival legislation which were suppressed by the P legislators. But while the hypothesis is possible, it has not the slightest evidence to support it. As we have seen, there is in Lev. 23 no trace whatever of an original H ritual of animal sacrifice. Moreover, we have seen that the P editing of Lev. 23 was none too skillful and effec tive. It would therefore be difficult to believe that, had the original H festival legislation contained provisions for animal sacrifice, these would all have been removed by the P editors of the chapter so completely and so skillfully that not the slightest trace thereof would remain. The natural conclusion is that the H festival legislation made no provision whatever for animal sacrifice formally offered directly to Yahweh at a sanctuary. This conclusion is strongly borne out by one additional and The solution of the problem, however, is quite simple. We have seen that the whole of w. 18-19 is P. Likewise v. 17a/3 is recognized by all scholars as P. Moreover, with v. 17a/3 omitted, it is clear that the expression, לחם תנופה, comes too soon; for not only has there been as yet no provision that these first-fruit grains should be baked as loaves of bread, but also actually there has been no statement that they should be "waved," which would justify the application to them at this point of the term תנופה. Accordingly the words לחם תנופה too in v. 17a must be RP. This leaves as original H material in this v. only מסושבתיכם תביאו בכורים ליהוה. Upon this then followed immediately the simple statement of v. 20a in its original form, והניף הכהן אתם לפני יהוה, followed in turn by the statement of v. 20b, that this taboo-sacrifice of first-fruits, offered to Yahweh in accordance with the old, established custom, was to belong to the priest for his own use. Manifestly this is a complete and well rounded statement.</page><page sequence="34">34 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [34] very significant consideration. It is recognized by all modern scholars that the original H calendar provided for only the three agricultural festivals, Passover-Mazzot, Shabuot and Sukkot. The entire original H legislation for the Passover-Mazzot festival has been suppressed by P in favor of its own sacrificial ritual for the festival, presented in vv. 5-8. Just why these P editors should have suppressed the original H ritual for this festival so corn pletely, can only be surmised. It seems reasonable to suppose, however, that it contained provisions for the celebration of the festival, not at a central sanctuary, but at home, precisely, as we shall see, as was the case with the H provisions for the célébra tion of the two other festivals, and that, moreover, this Passover Mazzot festival celebration at the home consisted not only of the eating of mazzot during the seven days of the Mazzot festi val, but also of the peculiar ritual of the Paschal lamb and the smearing of the blood thereof upon the threshold, lintel and doorposts of the house in the old, traditional manner, decidedly reminiscent of its original, non-Yahwistic import as a rite de signed to guard the home against the ingress of evil spirits, specifically the ghosts of dead members of the family, and in particular those who had died during the past year.47 To this ceremony, thus practiced, these P editors may well have taken exception, because of its manifest non-Yahwistic character, and instead of modifying and reinterpreting it, as did the later P2 legislators of Ex. 12.1-20, they may well have sought to suppress it completely, just as, beyond all question, the Deuteronomic reformers sought to do with their Passover legislation in Deut. 16.1-8 and their transfer of the scene of the Passover celebration from the home and its local environment to the central sanctu ary.48 It seems quite probable therefore that the H legislation 47 Cf.

Such is, however, not at all the case. For the</page><page sequence="35">[35] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 35 provided for the celebration of the Passover-Mazzot festival only at the home and in much the manner which we have sur mised. Also in all likelihood, the ceremony of cutting the first sheaf on the "day after the Sabbath," i. e., on the day after the close of the entire Passover-Mazzot festival,4' and the giving of it to the priest to be "waved" by him "before Yahweh," and then in all likelihood appropriated by him for his own use, was per formed, not at a sanctuary, since on the extremely busy day of the beginning of the actual harvest the people, with the utmost devotion in the world, could scarcely have spared the time to resort to a sanctuary, even a local one, to say naught of a central sanctuary. It must have been rather a strictly local rite per formed, if not in the home, then certainly in the field itself, from which this first sheaf was cut. Obviously too the ceremony of building and dwelling in booths during the Sukkot festival, whether a rite strictly integral in the H legislation for the festival or not,50 was a ceremony intended to be performed, not at a sanctuary, but at the home. And the ceremony with the four fruits, prescribed in Lev. 23.40 for the first day of the Sukkot festival, was in origin unquestion ably a fertility rite, and therefore more logically performed at home or in the field than at a sanctuary. It is significant too that nowhere in the scanty H material which has been preserved is there the slightest reference to or implication of a pilgrimage to the central sanctuary, or for that matter to any sanctuary whatever, for the celebration of the three festivals. This silence is all the more meaningful after the repeated insistence upon such pilgrimages in earlier Deuter onomic legislation.51 Paschal Iamb, sacrificed at home, and not at a sanctuary, and originally offered to the spirits of the dead upon the threshold of the house, and with the sprink ling of the blood upon the lintel and two doorposts, in order to prevent the entrance of these evil spirits into the home, was, particularly in the fairly primitive form in which H undoubtedly legislated for its observance, in no wise a sacrifice to Yahweh. י" Cf. M S ; also Bertholet, Handkommentar, to the passage. 50 Cf. below, pp. 57 ff. 5' Ex. 23.17; 34.23-24 (cf. M 7, 77 ff.); Deut. 16.1-17; 26.1-11.</page><page sequence="36">36 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [361 It appears therefore from all this that the H legislation for the festivals did not contemplate their celebration at a sanctuary at all, much less at the central sanctuary, but instead provided for their observance at the home or in the near-by field, and with peculiar rites of great antiquity and largely of non-Yahwistic: origin, designed in the main to ward off dangerous evil spirits and ensure the blessings of protection, fertility and abundance for the home and its inmates. It would seem almost as if this H legislation, with its sanction of these old folk-ceremonies and their observance at the home, was designed consciously to repeal the Deuteronomic legislation for the observance of these festivals at the central sanctuary, with its obvious basic purpose, the complete suppression of these non-Yahwistic folk-rites, recorded in Deut. 16.1-17.52 The role which the priest plays in the cere monies of the first sheaf and of the first-fruits53 is no argument against this conclusion. For it does not follow at all that the priest in question func tioned only in the sanctuary. The title הכהן here and throughout the Holiness Code proper, as well as in the Torah section of the Priestly Code, certainly does not designate necessarily only a member of the Sadokite or Aaronic priesthood. There is every reason to believe that these latter were carried into Babylonian captivity as a group. True, a few individuals may have escaped this general fate of their brethren, but at the best they could have been only very few; for concentrated as they were in Jerusalem, at the central sanctuary, the group as a whole must have fallen ready victims to Nebuchadrezzar's policy of deportation of the influential portions and classes of the Jewish nation.54 What few, if any, might have escaped this general fate could have continued to exercise but little influence upon the subsequent religious life and practice of their people still resident in Palestine. But what must have happened after the fall of Jerusalem and s2 Precisely as Lev. 17.1-7 was consciously designed to abrogate the Deut eronomic provision for killing animals for food, without any longer regarding them as a sacrifice, the blood of which had to be sprinkled upon the altar, recorded in Deut. 12.13-16; cf. below, note 60. 53 Vvs 10-11, 20. s&lt; II Ki. 24.14-16; Ezek. 1.3; cf. also the similar policy of Sargon at the capture of Samaria (II Ki. 17.24-28).</page><page sequence="37">[37] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 37 the deportation of the Sadokite priests can be easily imagined, even though the biblical records, for reasons readily apparent, are almost silent with regard thereto. It is impossible to con ceive of the people remaining in Palestine as entirely without religious ministration. The former, non-Sadokite, levitical priests who, previous to the Deuteronomic Reformation, only thirty-five years before, had functioned at the local sanctuaries, and whom the Deuteronomic Reformation, with its specific legislation bear ing thereon,55 had removed from their high and influential office and reduced to a humble, dependent, and unquestionably humil iating and galling economic and social state, in which they were commended to the charity of their lay fellow-citizens,56 to whom they had been functionally, and no doubt also socially, superior throughout a long past, and who were denied in practice by their Sadokite brethren in Jerusalem the privilege which the Deuter onomic Code had in theory conferred upon them, of functioning in priestly capacity at the central sanctuary, must during the Exile have gradually regained much of their former position of religious authority and leadership. Many of the former local sanctuaries must also have been revived in some fashion and become again centers of local worship; for the Deuteronomic Reformation was too recent for the memory of these local shrines and their various institutions and cults to have been completely erased. We know that immediately following, and in fact begin ning even somewhat before the downfall of the nation in 586 B.c. there was a natural and far-reaching, popular recrudescence of the pre-Deuteronomic, semi-Yahwistic, religious institutions and practices;57 and with this, of course, the former Deuteronomic antipathy to the local shrines and their native priesthoods must have largely, if not completely, disappeared. There may have been no extensive, physical restoration of the local shrines, for " Deut. 18.6-8; cf. II Ki. 23.9. 5' Deut. 14.27-29; 16.11, 14. 57 Cf. Jer. 44.15-19; also Ezek. 8. The historical authenticity of these rec ords and of the reaction against the Deuteronomic Reformation which they evidence, has recently been denied by Torrey (Pseudo-Ezekiel and the Original Prophecy,Prophecy, 1930), but for reasons which, with the best will in the world, I can not find convincing.</page><page sequence="38">38 JULIAN MORGENSTERN undoubtedly the people were too impoverished for that. But in the vicinities of the former local sanctuaries and in the homes throughout the land the old, local rites, abrogated by the Deuter onomic Reformation, and the old folk-celebrations of the festivals and other religious institutions must have been revived and flour ished anew.58 And the old, local, non-Sadokite, levitical priests must once again very largely have come into their own. But if we admit that the priest of Lev. 23.10, 11, and 20 was in all likelihood not a Sadokite, and that he may even have been connected, not with the central sanctuary at Jerusalem, but with one of the neighboring local shrines, or even may perhaps not have been connected actually with any shrine, but, because of his well known levitical, priestly family connections, may have continued to be regarded popularly as a priest and to enjoy therefore certain former priestly prerogatives and privileges, such as, among other similar things, receiving and using for his own maintenance the first-fruit and other taboo-sacrifices and offerings, prohibited by their very taboo-nature from lay con sumption or use,59 then the situation becomes quite different than as ordinarily pictured. Certainly the historical background of this legislation and of the legislation of all of the oldest stra turn of H is that of the closing period of the Exile, or better still, no doubt, the period intervening between the inauguration of the Persian policy toward the Jews in 539 B.C. and the com pletion and dedication of the second Temple in 516 B.c.60 We s8 Cf. the protest in Deut. 4.15a, 16-19a, 23aba, 24a, a product of this period; with this passage cf. Ezek. 8.10, 16 and M 11, 31 ff. 59 A privilege which even the Deuteronomic legislation accords to him in part; cf. Deut. 14.27-29. 60 The second stratum of H then, to which the H nucleus of Lev. 17 be longs, comes from the period following immediately upon the dedication of the second Temple. The obvious purpose of this H2 nucleus of Lev. 17 is, now that the Temple has been rebuilt, and the practice is therefore possible once again, to abrogate the Deuteronomic legislation in Deut. 12.13-16, permitting the slaughtering of animals for food, without airy longer regarding them as sacrifices. This it does by insisting first that the slaughtering of domestic ani mais is always and inevitably, Deuteronomic theory and legislation to the contrary notwithstanding, a sacrifice ; but if not offered to Yahweh at the central sanctuary and with the proper rite of pouring the blood upon the altar, then it</page><page sequence="39">[39] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 39 can readily picture therefore the ritual procedure here, the local priest himself collecting from the different householders, either must have been a sacrifice offered to false gods or demons, to the שעירם (Lev. 17.7). And now that the central sanctuary is once again ready to hand, and the small size of the early, post-Exilic, Jewish community and its immediate proximity to Jerusalem make it easily feasible for every slaughtering, even though primarily for food, to be performed at the central sanctuary and with the customary religious observance, H2 (Lev. 17) insists that such must be henceforth the invariable procedure. Doubly significant and confirming this interpretation of Lev. 17 is the fact that secondary, and obviously early post-Exilic Deuteronomic legislators themselves enacted precisely the same legislation and directed to the very same end; for Deut. 12.4-7, 11 provides that sacrifices of every kind, including 'peace-offerings," i. e., animals slain for food primarily, must be brought to the central sanctuary. This secondary, Deuteronomic legislation, it is clear, contradicts, and therefore impliedly repeals the earlier Deuteronomic legis lation on the same theme, in Deut. 12.13-16. Precisely the same historical background and purpose are implied also in the ritual procedure prescribed in Deut. 26.1-11, a passage of unquestionably D2 authorship (with the introductory clause, והיה כי תבוא . . . נחלה, cf. Deut. 17.14; 27.3; 31.7; also Ex. 12.25 [all unmistakably D2], and Lev. 14.34 [Pt]; 19.23 [H]; 23.10 [H]; 25.2 [H]; Num. 14.30 [P]; 15.2 [P or Pt]; therefore all, without exception, likewise passages from the very end of the Exile, or, even more probably, the early post-Exilic period). Here too the second Temple is already in existence, and so the sacrifice of first-fruits must be delivered to the priest at the sanctuary. In fact a moment's thought must show that this ritual procedure here parallels exactly the H legislation in Lev. 23.15-20, which we are now considering. Even more, it is clear that the D2 ritual legislation in Deut. 26.1-11 bears to this H legislation in Lev. 23.15-20 precisely the same relationship which the H2 legislation in Lev. 17 and the D2 legislation in Deut. 12.4-7,11 bear to the D1 legislation in Deut. 12.13-16, viz., it in turn repeals the H legislation in Lev. 23.15-20 by providing that the ceremony of giving the first-fruits to the priest on the annual Shabuot festival shall no longer be performed, as we have seen, at the home, but now that the second Temple has been erected, these first-fruits shall, quite naturally, be brought up there and, in proper sacrificial manner, shall be turned over to the priest of the sane tuary. Only if our assumption be correct, that the H festival legislation basic to to Lev. 23, presumed, or even actually commanded, the celebration of the three festivals, not at a sanctuary, but at home, and that Deut. 26.1-11 in turn repealed the specific provision there for the celebration of the Shabuot festival at the home and consciously transferred it to the second Temple, are all the implications of this latter passage fully comprehensible. Of course the rebuilding of the Temple carried with it the implication of the sanctioning anew of the single, central sanctuary and the abolition for the</page><page sequence="40">40 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [40] at their homes or in their fields, as the case may be, those partie ular portions of the crop which were his due, viz., the first sheaf of the new crop, no doubt usually consisting of barley, and then the first-fruits of all the subsequent crops which were put aside when it was begun to cut each successive crop, and which were delivered to the priest at the Shabuot festival at the end of the period of the grain-harvest. Either this procedure, or else, what is by no means impossible or improbable, though alto gether unevidenced and a bit more difficult to conceive, each householder brought his sacrifice of the first sheaf and of the subsequent first-fruits to the local sanctuary in his immediate vicinity, and there delivered it to the priest,61 and thus offered his taboo-sacrifice in the old, traditional manner. Only if we may assume that the H stratum of Lev. 23 was composed later than 516 b.c., which is hardly likely, may we conclude that these first-fruit sacrifices were necessarily brought only to the central sanctuary at Jerusalem.62 But even so, the priest in question would have been as a rule one of the non-Sadokite levites. Furthermore, these first-fruit sacrifices are called ר!נופת, "wave-offerings." The term תנופה seems to designate a peculiar type of sacrifice, not actually offered upon the altar, but which none the less plays an essential part in a ritual or religious act. In most cases, after the particular rite connected with the תנופה has been performed, the sacrifice itself becomes the property of second time of all local shrines, at least in Judea. But for the present, and until the return of the Sadokite priests under Ezra in 458 B.c., or even for a short time thereafter, the priests of the second Temple at Jerusalem con tinued to be the old, non-Sadokite levites, those whose native homes had been from of old, and, as the biblical evidence shows (cf. Jer. 1.1; Neh. 11.20; I Chron. 24.1-6), still continued to be in the villages outside of Jerusalem. 61 This may be the implication of והבאתם . ... אל הכהן in v. 10b and of ממושבתיכם תביאו in v. 17; but cf. the preceding note. 6' Unless, of course, the tradition recorded in Ezra 3.1-3 (I Esdras 5.48-50) be regarded as authentic, that the first act of the first group of returning exiles was to rebuild the altar on the site of the first Temple. This, in turn, might imply that this rebuilt altar continued to serve as the central sanctuary until the completion and dedication of the second Temple in 516 B.c. This is, however, quite improbable. Neither Haggai nor Zechariah show any clear evidences of the existence of this altar and of the centralization of worship there.</page><page sequence="41">[41] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 41 the officiating priest, to be enjoyed by him in his capacity as a ritual or tabooed personality. Thus in Lev. 14.12-32 the "wave offering" consists of a sheep and a measure of oil. These are first "waved" by the priest "before Yahweh"; then some of the blood of the sheep and some of the oil are smeared upon the lobe of the right ear, the right thumb and the right big toe of the leper who is being purified, and after this some of the oil is poured into the hollow of the left hand of the priest; into this he dips the finger of his right hand and then sprinkles the oil thereon seven times "before Yahweh"; thereupon he puts the remainder of the oil in his left hand upon the lobe of the right ear, the right thumb and the right big toe and then upon the head of the leper. This constitutes the basic ceremony of purification. It is not stated here just what is done with the flesh of the sheep and with the oil which remains in the vessel, but from Num. 18.11-19 we know that they become the property of the priest.63 According to Ex. 35.22; 38.24, 29 the gold and copper which the people brought for the construction of the tabernacle and its equipment were a "wave-offering"; and• according to Num. 8.11-16, the levites too were a "wave-offering," given in redemption for the first-born of the people, impliedly the natural priests, to Aaron and his sons, as their subordinates and assistants. Manifestly the basic implication is that the תנופה was a sacrifice of redemption or removal of taboo or of consecration to holy purposes, which, however, was not actually offered upon the altar, but which was instead either applied to the actual service of the sanctuary or else given to the priest for his own use and maintenance. The rite of "waving" must have been a symbolic act which represented the offering of the sacrifice to the Deity before the priest took final possession of it.64 63 Cf. also Lev. 7.30-32; 10.13-15; Num. 6.20; note also that according to Ex. 29.26; Lev. 8.27-29 Moses must eat the breast of Aaron's consecration sacrifice as the "wave-offering"; this implies that Moses' relation to Aaron in connection with this ceremony and this sacrifice corresponds to that of the priest to the lay-Israelite ordinarily. 6י Likewise in Deut. 26.1-11, the direct relationship of which to the orig inal H stratum of Lev. 23.15-20 we have already established, there is no state ment that the first-fruit sacrifice was actually offered upon the altar to the Deity. Instead w. 4 and 10 say specifically that it was merely deposited be</page><page sequence="42">42 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [42] These considerations make clear the full import of the giving of these first sheaves and first-fruits to the priest or priests as a "wave-offering." They must have constituted an important part of the annual income of the priests in this particular period, one of the main sources of their livelihood. We can easily understand therefore that the priests might either have collected these "wave-offerings" themselves from the individual farmers or else, though far less probably, that the latter brought these sacrifices to local, near-by shrines. But in either case our conclusion would be completely corroborated, that in the H Calendar the three annual agricultural festivals were celebrated, not at the sanct uary, but in the home and fields with a revival, or rather a sane tioning of old, pre-Deuteronomic rites, themselves largely of non-Yahwistic origin, but given by the H legislators a Yahwistic veneer and sanction. To a certain extent, it must be recognized, this H program achieved much of the objective of the Deuteronomic program; for obviously only such ancient ceremonies were sanctioned in the observance of the festivals as were basically not incompatible with with Yahweh concepts and worship; and correspondingly other ancient rites of these festivals, distinctly non-Yahwistic in char acter and incapable of harmonization with Yahweh-worship, were by the implication of silence effectively excluded from the Yahweh-cult. Perhaps this H procedure of compromise with old and deep-rooted rites and ceremonies was more effective than the Deuteronomic program of uncompromising and absolute pro hibition and abrogation of all that was ancient and traditional and likewise non-Yahwistic in origin. Certainly the H program, in significant contrast to that of the Deuteronomic reformers, was that of compromise with ancient folk-custom and folk practice, and the sanctioning of such rites as seemed too deeply fore Yahweh, in front of the altar. Apparently this depositing of this grain sacrifice in front of the altar was a symbolic act, by which a pretense of offer ing the sacrifice to the Deity was made, but actually the sacrifice became thereby the property of the functioning priest. But if so, then the act of depos iting the sacrifice in front of the altar was a symbolic rite paralleling exactly in nature and intent the "waving" of the sacrifice in the H ritual. But if this be granted, then the direct relationship of Deut. 26.1-11 with the original H stratum of Lev. 23.15-20 becomes doubly apparent.</page><page sequence="43">[43] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 43 rooted and too vital to the people for their protection against evil and for the assurance of an adequate crop and food-supply to be readily abrogated, and which were at the same time not too impossible of an artificial, even though at the same time a somewhat superficial adaptation to Yahwistic religious practice. But, by the implication of silence, other ancient rites, intimately associated from of old with the celebration of the three festivals, the original, non-Yahwistic character of which could not be too easily and completely disguised, remained unsanctioned.65 On the basis of this analysis and these various considerations we may now attempt to determine the date which the H calendar assigned for the celebration of the combined Passover-Mazzot festival. But this question can be answered only by correlating it with the dating of the combined festival in the Deuteronomic Code.66 As is generally recognized, originally the Passover and the Mazzot festivals were entirely independent, unrelated festi vais. The former was rooted in nomadic or semi-nomadic, pas toral life, while just as unmistakably the origins of the latter were in the agricultural life of Palestine. Out in the desert the 65 Such rites as those of the maidens dancing in the vineyards (cf. M 4) or the greeting of the first rays of the rising sun upon the New Year's Day (cf. M 11). Quite the same principle seems to have animated the legislation of Pt, for there too we find sanctioned, with, however, a superficial and readily discernible Yahwistic veneer, quite a number of ancient rites, conspicuously non-Yahwistic in origin, such as the trial by ordeal of the woman suspected of adultery (cf. M 12), the ceremony of the red heifer (Num. 19), originally a sac rifice to the ghost of the dead person, (cf. Scheftelowitz, "Das Opfer der roten Kuh [Num. 19[, ZAIV 39 [1922], 113-123), and the ceremonies with the two birds in the purification of the leper (Lev. 14.49-53). Pt was the product of a period approximately the same as, or at the most but a few years later than H2. Manifestly this spirit of compromise with ancient, non-Yahwistic rites and ceremonies and their sanctioning and incorporation, by means of a superim posed sacrificial procedure, into the official cult of Yahweh, was dominant in this early post-Exilic period; cf. also the interesting ceremony of the heifer whose neck was broken (Deut. 21.1-9), incorporated into Deut. likewise in this same period. Inasmuch as in this period (circ. 539-485 b.c.) a univer salistic outlook seems to have been paramount in the interpretation and prac tice of Judaism (cf. for example, Zech. 8.13, 20-23; Mai. 1.5, 11), it is not at all surprising that such an attitude should have obtained at this time, in significant contrast to the uncompromising and rigoristic iconoclasm of the Deuteronomic Reformation a century before. 66 Deut. 16.1-8.</page><page sequence="44">44 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [44] Israelite tribes had known and observed only the Passover festi val. After their entrance into Canaan and their gradual discard of their semi-nomadic life, institutions and habits in favor of the settled, agricultural life which the topographic and economic conditions of the greater part of Palestine naturally fostered and even compelled, the pastoral Passover festival tended more and more to be outgrown and discarded, particularly in the more fertile central and northern parts of the country, where agri cultural civilization flourished most extensively. In its stead the Canaanite Mazzot festival, celebrated at almost the same mo ment in the calendar year, tended to find an ever increasing observance among the Israelite peasants. In the South, on the other hand, where, because of the comparative sterility of the land, the pastoral life maintained itself persistently alongside of the developing agricultural civilization, the Passover naturally was more tenacious of observance. Accordingly in the Kenite Code, compiled in prophetic, Rechabite circles in the south,67 even though the Mazzot festival is dominant, provision is still made for the offering of the Paschal sacrifice.68 On the other hand, in the slightly later, northern adaptation of this Kenite Code, made likewise under Rechabite influence,65 but with a more pronounced agricultural trend, the Mazzot festival still holds first place; but the Passover festival seems to have disap peared almost completely, so that, in place of the specific legis lation of the Kenite Code for the offering of the peculiar Paschal sacrifice, the Book of the Covenant has merely a prescription for all festival sacrifices in general, but for no one festival, and least of all the Passover, sacrifice in particular.70 Furthermore, there is not the slightest intimation in the Kenite Code that the two festivals, Mazzot and Passover, were directly related to each other either in the time of their celebration or in any other man ner. «ז Cf. M 7. 68 Ex. 34.18, 25b (cf. M 7, 66-69, 73-79 for the original form of vv. 18 and 22). It should be noted that the dating of the Mazzot festival at the new moon of Abib was not in either the original K document nor yet in the Book of the Covenant (Ex. 23.15), but is in both passages the work of RD. 6' Ibid. 1° Ex. 23.18b.</page><page sequence="45">[45] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 45 And actually these two festivals were in origin related to each other in regard to the moments of their celebration only approx imately and accidentally. The Passover, strictly speaking a festival celebrated only during one night, was observed originally upon the night of the new moon preceding the beginning of the spring season. This was probably identical generally, if not invar iably, with the night of the new moon preceding the spring equi nox. On the other hand, the Mazzot festival was celebrated originally during the week beginning on Sunday and ending on Saturday71 in which the spring equinox actually fell. The two festivals were accordingly celebrated originally, and likewise during the early period of the sojourn of the Israelites in Pales tine, in fairly close proximity, though not at all necessarily in immediate juxtaposition to each other. This process of bringing the two festivals into immediate juxtaposition in such manner that the one might dominate the other, was apparently the work of the Deuteronomic reformers. Manifestly this end could be achieved in two ways, either by separating the Mazzot festival from its original connection with the spring equinox and transferring it to a new date, making it begin on the morning following the new moon preceding the spring equinox, i. e., on the morning after the Passover festival, or, on the other hand, by transferring the Passover festival from its original moment of celebration on the night of the new moon preceding the spring equinox to the night preceding the tradi tional beginning of the Mazzot festival. This latter process would, of course, divest the Passover festival of all connection with the new moon. Now actually the first of these two alternative processes was that approved by the Deuteronomic reformers. As a careful reading of Deut. 16.1-8 shows, with them the Passover idea was dominant. This was quite natural when we view the Deuterono mic Reformation, as it undoubtedly was, in theory at least, as a back-to-Yahweh movement, away from the concepts and institu tions of Canaanite, agricultural religion as well as from the influence of all foreign religious and general cultural practices. מ Cf. M 5.</page><page sequence="46">46 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [46] These Deuteronomic reformers must have been more or less conscious of the fact that the Passover was the festival directly associated in its general origins with Yahweh, while the Mazzot festival, on the other hand, was of a specifically Canaanite, agri cultural, non-Yahwistic origin. Furthermore, the peculiar rite of the Passover sacrifice, with its attendant ceremony of the smearing of the blood thereof upon the threshold, doorposts, and lintels of the house, in order to guard the inmates against the entrance and attacks of the ghosts of their dead, particularly those who had died during the year,72 a rite which smacked posi tively of remote, pre-Yahwistic, animistic origins, was apparently most obnoxious to them. But, on the other hand, this particular rite, of pronouncedly sacrificial character, lent itself readily to their general program of the centralization of all legitimate wor ship of Yahweh in the sanctuary at Jerusalem. Accordingly in their legislation they combined the two festivals and made the Passover principle dominant. They provided that the Passover might now be celebrated only at the central sanctuary and that all people must come up thither for its celebration. There the peculiar Paschal sacrifice was to be offered, still at night; but now it might consist of either a sheep or an ox, and the flesh thereof was to be boiled, and not roasted, as apparently was the practice with the original Paschal sacrifice. In this way they recast completely the nature of the Paschal sacrifice and made of it, despite the fact of its being offered at night, a more or less conventional selem-sacrifice to Yahweh. The following morning the people returned to their homes and began the celebration of the Mazzot festival in a rather mechanical and colorless manner by the eating of mazzot instead of leavened bread, and with apparently no other attendant rites, except upon the very last day of the festival.73 And this last was but natural, and in fact practically inevi table. For the coordination of the Mazzot festival with the Pass over and the moving up of the time of its celebration from the week of the spring equinox to the morning following the cele bration of the Passover on the night of the new moon preceding the spring equinox, necessarily separated the Mazzot festival v Cf. above, note 47. 5י Cf. below, note 100.</page><page sequence="47">[47] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 47 from all of its old connections with agricultural life, and partie ularly with the ceremony of greeting the first rays of the rising sun upon the day of the spring equinox,7יי and the very significant rite of the ceremonial cutting of the first sheaf upon the morning following the close of the festival, i. e., upon the morning of the "day after the Sabbath" of the original festival.73 This, in turn, necessarily caused the Mazzot festival as such, apart from the Passover celebration on the first night, to lose much of its former, distinctive, agricultural character as a Canaanite religious institu tion, and to become largely a colorless, conventional, joyless festival in honor of Yahweh. This was obviously altogether in accordance with the program of the Deuteronomic reformers; but equally this process, which took all the joy and folk-character out of the old Mazzot festal celebration, must have been decidedly dis tasteful to the people at large. This divorce of the Mazzot festival from its original connec tion with the spring equinox and the beginning of the actual harvest in the Deuteronomic program becomes all the more evident when we consider its legislation for the Shabuot festival in Deut. 16.9-12. Although the name חג שבעות, "Festival of Weeks," is now given for the first time76 to this festival, and it יד Cf. M 11. 75 This was, of course, a Sunday (cf. M 5). It is clear that this Deuter onomic reform of the festival calendar terminated the older practice of begin ning the Mazzot festival upon a Sunday and concluding it upon a Saturday, with the cutting of the first sheaf of the new crop on the following morning, of course a Sunday likewise. Instead in the Deuteronomic calendar the Mazzot festival began on the morning following the night of the new moon and the Passover celebration, regardless of whatever day of the week it may have been, and the ancient rite of ceremonially cutting the first sheaf, now performed as a simple, non-significant agricultural act at the beginning of the harvest season, lost its old, religious import as well as its immediate connection with the Maz zot festival. Thus by this simple process of integrating the Mazzot festival with the Passover, and in consequence the moving of its celebration up by a period which must have averaged approximately two weeks, the Deuterono mic reformers divested the Mazzot festival completely, or almost completely, of its old, Canaanite agricultural connections and implications. Their pur pose and procedure are easily comprehended. But, as we shall see shortly, the authors of H followed the other alternative course. 76 This name in Ex. 34.22 is an RD substitution for the original חג הקציר (cf. M 7, 73-79). The substitution of this new name for the older, specifically</page><page sequence="48">48 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [48] is still reckoned as coming exactly seven weeks after the moment of cutting the first sheaf, the celebration of this last act as an important religious rite no longer comes on the morning after the close and as the climax, as it were, of the seven-day Mazzot festival. The cutting of the first sheaf is now an ordinary act of agricultural life, with no particular religious significance what ever. Above all, it has no longer, under the Deuteronomic pro gram, any connection at all with the Mazzot festival. A period of days, varying in number from year to year, now intervenes between the week of celebration of the Mazzot festival and the moment of cutting the first sheaf. The latter moment is deter mined by the state of the crop alone. The observance of the spring equinox with its peculiar, solar rites, originally an integral and important part of the celebration of the Mazzot festival, is now completely abrogated. Thus the former direct connection of the Shabuot festival with and dependence upon the Mazzot festival was severed entirely in the Deuteronomic program. Whether, and to what extent, the Deuteronomic calendar shifted the date of the Sukkot festival is not quite clear because of the ambiguity of the dating of the festival in Deut. 16.13, viz., at the time of "gathering in from threshing-floor and wine press." In itself this dating is clear enough. But whether this date may be identified with the older dating of the festival, upon the last seven days of the year, viz., VII/3-9, with the New Year's Day upon the next day, VII/10, is not at all certain. All in all it may be inferred that the two datings are not entirely identi cal, and that the Deuteronomic reformers were consciously striving to dissociate the Sukkot festival from its former con nection with the day of the fall equinox, the old New Year's Day, with peculiar and manifestly non-Yahwistic rites; for other wise there would have been no apparent reason why they should not have continued to date the festival in the old manner. But in such case the dating of the festival at the time of "gathering in from the threshing-floor and wine-press" must represent the agricultural name may also have been a part of the program of the Deuter onomic reformers to alter the original, specifically agricultural character of the three festivals as much as possible. For the change of the older name, הג האסיף, to the later name, חג הסכות, cf. below, pp. 61 f.</page><page sequence="49">[49] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 49 shifting of the time of the celebration of the festival by at least a few days; but whether this shifting was forward or backward, it is, of course, impossible to determine. Under either condition, however, the ancient relationship of this festival to the day of the fall equinox and its celebration was completely broken up. And with this, apparently, the celebration of the New Year's Day was discontinued, at least in theory.77 And in theory, at least, it is self-evident, the Deuteronomic festival calendar was well planned and effective in achieving the dominant Deuteronomic purpose. But, as has been intimated, the rigorous and iconoclastic Deuteronomic program was obviously carried through only by royal support and compulsion during Josiah's brief reign. Imme diately after his death the reaction set in, furthered quite mani festly by the foreign policies of both Jehoiakim and Zedekiah, and reached its climax in the period following immediately upon the destruction of the Temple and the nation in 586 B.c.,78 or even in the period following the first deportation in 597 B.c.79 And with this the old rites and ceremonies must have been re vived in very large, if not in absolutely complete measure. It was no doubt partly as a result of this reaction against the rigorism of the Deuteronomic Reformation that, as was intimated above, the old, local, non-Sadokite, levitical priests once more came into their own. As has likewise been suggested, the Holiness Code, the oldest stratum of which seems to have been composed in Palestine in the period between 539 and 516 B.c., had apparently a goal quite similar to that of the older Deuteronomic Code, to organize the worship of Yahweh systematically and along approved lines, and to purge it, so far as possible, of the most pronounced and זלזזזל Only in theory, however; for Jer. 41.1-7 attests amply that in 586 B.c. the festival was still observed during VI1/3-9, the last seven days of the year, as of old, or else at least that this dating of the festival and the old manner of its celebration had been revived in the reaction against the extreme rigorism of the Deuteronomic Reformation which had set in some years previ ously; cf. M 4, 44-47. 8י Cf. Jer. 44. '» Cf. Ezek. 8,</page><page sequence="50">50 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [50] objectionable elements of ancient, non-Yahwistic worship. But apparently profiting by the sad outcome of the well-intentioned and vigorous Deuteronomic Reformation, and likewise having no royal authority to enforce its program, and perhaps also having a somewhat different outlook upon the religious and cultural problems of its day, the Holiness Code sought to attain its goal by milder and more reasonable means, by yielding, so far as was consistent, to popular opinion and practice. Various of the old religious institutions and practices of unmistakably Canaanite origin, which were none the less compatible with Yahweh-worship, or could, with comparatively slight modifica tion and reinterpretation, be reformulated as Yahweh-rites and integrated into the Yahweh-cult, now found the definite sanction which the more rigorous and uncompromising Deuteronomic Code had denied them. There was at this particular moment no central sanctuary to interpose any serious and practical obstacle in the way of this policy of compromise with the popular folk religion. Among these institutions was the Mazzot festival in its pre Deuteronomic form. At any rate it is clear that the authors of the Holiness Code sought to solve the problem of the combined Passover-Mazzot festival in a manner precisely the opposite to that chosen by the Deuteronomic reformers. Instead of making the Passover the dominant element in the combined festival celebration, they assigned this role to the Mazzot festival. In stead of fixing the date for the celebration of the combined festi val at the new moon preceding the spring equinox, they set it at the time when, according to the old, pre-Deuteronomic system of calendation, the Mazzot festival would regularly have fallen, viz., during the week from Sunday through Saturday in which the spring equinox occurred. The Passover festival itself, which apparently they did not seek to dissociate from the Mazzot festival, with which the Deuteronomic reformers had linked it inseparably, they must have set upon the Saturday night pre ceding the Sunday morning upon which the Mazzot festival proper began. This dating of the festival reestablished not only the old connection of the Mazzot festival with the day of the spring equinox, but also its original relation to the beginning of</page><page sequence="51">[51] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 51 the harvest season, marked by the solemn cutting of the first sheaf of the new grain. Once again this important rite falls upon the Sunday following the close of the Mazzot festival proper, the "day after the Sabbath." It may indeed seem venturesome to posit so much upon the basis of the scanty material from the Holiness Code which has been preserved. Yet no other conclusion is possible. On- the one hand, there is no reason to doubt that H retained the close juxta position of the two festivals which the Deuteronomic Code had established. There is not the slightest evidence anywhere in all subsequent biblical literature pointing to a celebration of the Passover and Mazzot festivals separately and independently of each other. Later Priestly writers or editors have suppressed completely the H legislation regulating the celebration of the joint Paissover-Mazzot festival by substituting their own provi sions for the dating and formal manner of celebration of the com bined festival, in Lev. 23.5-8. But we may safely assume that they did not take this drastic editorial step merely because of an irresistible desire to enforce their own method of celebrating the festival; for had this been their motivating consideration, they would then undoubtedly have suppressed completely the entire H legislation for all the festivals. In addition to this general motive they must have regarded the H provisions for the cele bration of the Passover-Mazzot festival, and especially its date, and also the manner of its celebration as a home festival, as particularly incompatible with true Yahweh-worship, as they understood and interpreted it. Accordingly they acted in the simplest and most direct manner possible and suppressed the entire Passover-Mazzot legislation of H, even while they retained certain elements of the H legislation for the other festivals. We can therefore only conjecture what this H Passover-Mazzot leg islation may have been. But the very fact of its complete sup pression, without a trace surviving, is in itself suggestive of what its true nature and content must have been. Fortunately they failed somehow, with a shortsightedness and irresponsibility difficult to comprehend, but the extent of which is established by scores of parallel instances, to suppress the closely related H provisions for the ceremony of cutting and</page><page sequence="52">52 • JULIAN MORGENSTERN [52] offering the first sheaf of the new grain upon the "day after the Sabbath." This they allowed to stand, and even amplified it by provision for an animal sacrifice to be offered simultaneously with it. Impliedly too they changed the nature of the rite from a simple ceremony in the open field to one more complex and performed in the Temple at the altar. But despite this they could not obliterate the true character of this interesting rite and the precise implication of the "day after the Sabbath," viz., that according to the H legislation the Mazzot festival was celebrated for a week beginning on Sunday and ending on Saturday. This consideration establishes beyond all question that the old, agri cultural character and connections of the Mazzot festival had been sanctioned anew by the Holiness Code, and that in conse quence it must have restored the Mazzot festival to its original date in relation to the day of the spring equinox and the begin ning of the harvest of the new grain. And this carries with it the added conclusion that the Passover must by the H legislators have been subordinated to the Mazzot festival, and the original date of the latter festival fixed for the celebration of the joint festival, a procedure precisely the reverse of that which, as we have seen, the Deuteronomic legislators followed. This conclusion can not be doubted. Thus we complete the first step in recon structing the calendar of the Holiness Code.80 The next step in this task, viz., the determination of the date of the Festival of First-fruits or Shabuot, is comparatively simple. This was, as a matter of course, the fiftieth day after the day of offering the first sheaf, the day after the close of the Mazzot festival proper. It too fell necessarily on a Sunday. It must have come near the close of the second or the beginning of the third month of the H calendar, dependent upon the specific moment in the first month when the Mazzot festival was celebrated. 80 Whether and to what extent the old celebration of the equinoctial day (cf. Mil) was revived and sanctioned by the H legislators for the Passover Mazzot festival it is impossible, of course, to determine. But it is not at all unlikely that some of the less pronouncedly non-Yahwistic rites connected with this equinoctial festival may have found an H sanction. And this, in turn, may have been one of the cogent reasons for the eventual suppression of the entire H legislation for the festival by later P editors.</page><page sequence="53">[53] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 53 Inasmuch, however, as this was a date which must have varied to the extent of at least six days, depending upon the incidence of the spring equinox within the Sunday-Saturday week of the Mazzot festival, the date of the month of the Festival of First fruits must likewise have varied correspondingly and have fallen at times within the last few days of the second month and at other times within the first few days of the third month. To a large extent this would depend also upon the exact nature of the calendar of H and to what extent it harmonized the diver gences between the solar and the lunar years, and the conse quent moment within the first month in which the spring equinox fell. If the harmonization of the solar and lunar years was of such character that the spring equinox came regularly at or close to the beginning of the first month, then the Festival of First fruits would necessarily be celebrated regularly only within the last few days of the second month; if, however, this harmoniza tion was not of this nature, and the spring equinox might fall at any time within the first month, then the Festival of First-fruits might not infrequently fall well within the third calendar month. Our final task in the reconstruction of the festival calendar of H is to determine the date which it assigned to the Sukkot festival. The analysis of vv. 39-43 is difficult and in one or two short passages more or less uncertain. As the afore-cited table of proposed analyses of Lev. 23 shows, scholars have long been in practical agreement that the legislation for the Sukkot festival in vv. 33-36 must be assigned to P. Likewise within w. 39-43 those passages which fix the exact date of the month for the cele bration of the festival, viz., v. 39aa (- אך), and also v. 39b, and v. 41b must be assigned to P. Whether, however, all that re mains after the excision of these portions belongs to the original H nucleus of Lev. 23 is a question which must be carefully inves tigated. In the first place it is significant that the command to cele brate the Sukkot festival over a period of seven days occurs four times in what remains of vv. 39-42. Certainly this is entirely too frequent and suggests editorial handiwork. Apparently the statement in v. 39a, near the beginning of this paragraph, and therefore in its logical place, should have sufficed to fix the dura</page><page sequence="54">54 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [54] tion of the festival. At the most the supplementary statement in v. 42a, that the people should dwell in booths during these seven days might seem more or less essential to a clear and detailed statement of the prescribed manner of celebration of the festival. But the two statements in w. 40b and 41a are more or less sus picious, and particularly the first. For undoubtedly after the explicit command in v. 40a with regard to the four plants, we would expect an equally explicit statement of the nature of the rite to be performed with these plants. Instead we get the at first glance apparently colorless and non-committal statement in v. 40b, "And ye shall rejoice before Yahweh, your God, for seven days." It is difficult to conceive from this vague statement just what role, if any, these four plants might have played in this "rejoicing before Yahweh." Moreover, the phrase itself, as well as the general command to celebrate the agricultural festivals with "rejoicing before Yahweh," is strongly reminiscent of RD, but has no parallel whatever in H.81 Furthermore, the charge to celebrate these festivals with rejoicing has a distinct and pur posed role in the Deuteronomic program of the revised festival celebration, when we remember that in the older, pre-Deutero nomic form of celebration the festivals began with rites of mourn ing for the dead Tammuz;82 but in the H program for the cele 81 Cf.

That this form of celebrating the Sukkot festival persisted until at least the time of Ezra and Nehemiah is evidenced by the necessity which those leaders experienced on the occasion of the reading of the law on the Sukkot festival of reminding the people insistently and pointedly that the first days of the festival were days, not of mourning and weeping, but of rejoicing, of eating and drinking and sending gifts to the poor (Neh. 8.9-12). Obviously the mourning and weeping were not, as v. 9b/3 parenthetically remarks, because of the people's hearing the Torah read again, impliedly after a long lapse of this rite; for while we might imagine them weeping for joy on this impliedly happy occasion, we can scarcely imagine weeping as general as this is represented as being; and certainly we can not account for the people's mourning when they heard the Torah read. Manifestly, following ancient custom, the people ob served the first day of the festival as one of sadness, weeping and mourning. But realizing that this was an old, non-Yahwistic rite, we can understand all</page><page sequence="55">[55] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 55 bration of the three festivals this charge can not have the same purport, at least not in any comparable degree. It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that v. 40b is the work of some post Exilic scribe or editor, who substituted this Deuteronomic in junction for the observance of this festival in place of the prescrip tion with regard to the use of these four plants which must have stood here originally. The sanctioning of the use of these four plants, whatever may have been its origin as a non-Yahwistic, homoeopathic magical rite, was altogether in accord with the spirit of compromise and assimilation which, we have learned, was basic in H.83 Even more significant is the solution of the problem of the reference to the seven days of the festival in v. 41a. It must be admitted that the charge to celebrate the festival "seven days in the year," in addition to being in its present form tautological and unnecessary, is also vague and peculiar. What is the import of the phrase, בשנה, "in the year"? The phrase is never used else where in a similar context, although it would be quite as approp riate or, perhaps better, inappropiate, elsewhere as it is here. Moreover, without this phrase, the clause says precisely the same thing as that stated already and with sufficient clarity in v. 39a/3. Impliedly therefore the phrase "in the year" here should add something specific to the thought of v. 39a/3. What can this have been? This question can be answered only by surmise. Our sur mise is that the present, quite meaningless phrase, בשנה, is an editorial modification of the original בצאת השנה. Inasmuch as, as the better the eagerness of Ezra to suppress it and to encourage in its stead a spirit of gladness and merry-making quite in acccord with the Deuteronomic legislation for these festivals. 83 This ceremony with the four fruits, as a fertility rite, seems to parallel strikingly, both in form and in spirit, the ceremony with the first sheaf of the new crop on the day following the close of the Mazzot festival. It is significant that both ceremonies are specifically prescribed in H, the agricultural character of the legislation of which we have already discussed. That Deut. 16.13-15 is completely silent with regard to this ceremony with the four plants, just as it is silent with regard to the ceremony with the first sheaf, indicates undoub tedly that it sought to abrogate both rites, presumably on the ground that, as fertility rites, they were of non-Yahwistic origin and character. And just as H legislators revived the ceremony with the first sheaf, so apparently they revived the ceremony with the four fruits likewise.</page><page sequence="56">56 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [56j we have seen, in its festival legislation H to a considerable extent bases itself upon and sanctions earlier practice, it need not be at all surprising that in all likelihood the H legislators dated the Sukkot festival, and in so doing used precisely the same phrase, as did their predecessors, the authors of the original stratum of the Book of the Covenant.84 Naturally this seems at first a matter which can not be proved with absolute finality, that it must remain in the main a hypothesis, but, it must be admitted, a a hypothesis so natural and probable that it is difficult to resist. The reason for the editorial revision of this original reading would be self-evident; the revision would be the work of RP, and nat" urally in the interest of the revised Priestly dating of the Sukkot festival, beginning on the full moon of the seventh month, exactly two weeks after the New Year's Day, and no longer on the last seven days of the old year, immediately preceding the New Year's Day. However, one significant bit of evidence tends to corroborate this conclusion that the original reading here was בצאת השנה. It has long been recognized by biblical scholars that in his celebration of the Sukkot festival Ezra followed, in the main,85 the prescriptions set forth in this very paragraph of H.86 Now it is of extreme significance that, as we have shown elsewhere,87 Ezra began his reading of the Torah upon VII/1. Upon VII/2 he read this paragraph from H, and in accordance therewith the people proceeded, still upon the same day, to gather the pre scribed plants for the celebration of the Sukkot festival. The implication of this is, of course, unmistakable. The Sukkot festi val of Neh. 8 must have begun upon VII/3 and have continued for seven days, i e., through VII/9, the last seven days of the year; and upon VII/10, the day following the close of the seven day Sukkot festival proper, the eighth day of actual celebration, they celebrated a day of peculiar sanctity in accordance with established custom.88 The day is there designated by the rather «4 Ex. 23.16; cf. M 7, 73-79. 85 Though not completely; cf. below, pp. 138 ff. 86 Neh. 8.14-17. 8'Ml, 28-35. 88 כמשפט, Neh. 8.18.</page><page sequence="57">[57] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 57 colorless title עצרת. Undoubtedly it was Rosh Hashanah, and was so designated originally in the v. The substitution of the present term עצרת, clearly by a late Priestly editor, was, of course, to make the account of the festival celebration here correspond as completely as possible with the P festival calen dar,8' obviously introduced at a period later than the time of Ezra and Nehemiah. However, leaving this last consideration, as to the literary history of the term עצרת here, out of the question for the moment, the fact remains, beyond all doubt, that the Sukkot festival of Neh. 8, celebrated in the main in accordance with the H pre scriptions in the very paragraph which we have under considéra tion, fell upon VII/3-9, the last seven days of the year. We may therefore conclude with reasonable certainty that the present meaningless phrase in v. 41a, בשנה, read originally בצאת השנה, and that the exact dating of the festival in the calendar, other wise completely missing, was thus given, "And ye shall celebrate it as a festival in honor of Yahweh for seven days at the end of the year," and that the date of the festival celebration in Neh. 8 conformed exactly to the original dating of the festival here. We shall have shortly one additional bit of evidence which will lend further corroboration to this conclusion. One further question with regard to the analysis of w. 39-43, viz., whether vv. 42-43 are wholly or only in part H. As the table shows, the majority of modern biblical scholars seem inclined to assign them to H. But certain considerations challenge this assignment. In the first place, in no wise do these verses repre sent that the booths of the festival celebration were made from the four plants listed in v. 40, or that these had any connection whatever with the booths. Consequently the dwelling in booths during the seven days of the festival seems to be cited here merely as an additional festival rite, apparently secondary to the cere mony, whatever it may have actually been in all its details, which was observed with the four plants. The implication seems to be that the ceremony with the four plants was the basic and active feature of the celebration of the festival, particularly upon 8י Cf. below, pp. 64 f.</page><page sequence="58">58 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [58] the first day,90 while the dwelling in booths during the entire seven days of the festival was but a passive and subsidiary rite. The antiquity of the custom of dwelling in booths during the celebration of the festival is attested by Hos. 12.10b. Accord ingly there seems to be as yet no compelling reason to doubt that v. 42a here is from the original H nucleus of this paragraph. But certainly the situation is altogether different with v. 42b. 50 That these so-called "four fruits," technically known as lulab or hosa'na', played originally an important role in the festival, and especially in connection with fertility rites, and in particular rain ceremonies, may be easily inferred from the nature of the ceremonies connected with them still in post-biblical usage and sanctioned by rabbinical authority (cf. Sukkah, III. 1-IV.4; Ta'anit, 2b; Jer. Ta'anit, 63c; JE, VIII, 205 ff.). The Mishna clearly implied that even though the custom had developed of carrying and shaking the lulab in the Temple on all seven days of the festival except the Sabbath of the festival week, still, if the first day of the festival happened to fall upon the Sabbath, the lulab was shaken none the less (Sukkah IV, 2). In fact, as Rashi to this passage states, this Temple practice was based entirely upon the specific em phasis laid in Lev. 23.40a upon the use of the lulab upon the first day of the festival as a rite bound up particularly with the ritual of this one day. In other words, regardless of the explicit command of vv. 42-43 here and also of the implications of Neh. 8.15, the rabbis interpreted v. 40a as referring, not to the dwelling in booths made of these plants, but instead to the ceremony with the lulab,lulab, particularly upon the first day of the festival. (The Sadducees, on the. other hand, rejected the institution of the lulab and, just on the basis of Neh. 8.13-17, insisted that the four plants of Lev. 23.40 were to be used in making booths; cf. Ibn Ezra to Lev. 23.40.) With this should be compared the parallel ceremony with the palm branch es, likewise called hosa'na', on Sunday, the first day of the old Mazzot festival, which gave to this day in the early Christian church its distinctive name, "Palm Sunday", or "the day of palms." From the New Testament references (John 12.32; cf. Matt. 21.8 f.; Mark. 11.8) the inference may be drawn that this custom of carrying the hosa'na' on the first day of the Mazzot festival, or at least the tradition thereof, survived in certain Jewish circles or sects well into the present era, in all likelihood at least to the destruction of the Temple in 70 a.d. And inasmuch as Christian tradition has insisted that this day of carrying the palm branches, this first day of the Mazzot festival, was a Sunday, that, in other words, the particular Jewish circle or sect in question must have celebrated the Passover-Mazzot festival from Sunday through Saturday, we may quite probably identify them with the Sadducees. That these four plants seem likewise to have had some relationship to the so-called Adonis gardens is also beyond question. But this entire matter is of sufficient interest to warrant independent and more detailed treatment.</page><page sequence="59">[59] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 59 This half-verse seems to command that only the native Jew must dwell in booths during the festival, and to imply that the non Jew is not obligated to this service. Bertholet has called attention to the significant fact that this is the only passage in the entire Bible in which the word אזרח is used without its natural comple ment, 91,גר and, admitting his inability to solve the problem in any other manner, he holds that the latter term must have stood here originally and for one reason or another have fallen out. The hypothesis seems quite plausible at first glance, for it is difficult to imagine off-hand any reason why the non-Jew resident within the land should have been denied the privilege of parti cipating in this particular rite when other rites of seemingly much more direct and specific significance were permitted to him. Furthermore, as Bertholet has very aptly pointed out, Deuter onomic legislation, both primary and secondary,92 sanctions the unrestricted participation of the stranger in the celebration of the Sukkot festival, while Deutero-Zechariah makes it practically mandatory, even for non-Jewish peoples dwelling outside of Palestine.93 It is difficult therefore to imagine that any legis 91 Die Stellung der Israeliten und der Juden zu den Fremden, 171 f.; Com mentarymentary to this passage. Actually the word אזרח occurs only sixteen times in the entire Bible. (It occurs also in Ps. 37.35, but is there certainly an expansion from an original ארז; cf. the commentaries to this v.) Fourteen of these sixteen occurrences are in the Pentateuch, and all, without a single exception, are from P, and for the most part from P2 or RP. Of the two extra-Pentateuchal pas sages, the word occurs in Josh. 8.33 in what is undoubtedly a RP insertion. It occurs also in Ezek. 47.22, a passage which, precisely as 45.21-25 (cf. below, note 166), is closely related to late P legislation. It needs but a moment's thought to realize that this word, apparently entirely unknown in pre-Exilic literature, particularly when contrasted, as it is in every one of the sixteen biblical passages in which it occurs, with the exception of this passage here, with the term גר, in the sense of "proselyte to Judaism," a connotation likewise peculiar to P (cf. Bertholet, op. cit., 171 f.), could not have acquired its tech nical meaning, "a born Jew," until the rise of the trend toward particularism in Judaism which culminated in the marriage reforms of Ezra and Nehemiah and in the separatistic, ritualistic provisions of the Priestly Code, i. e., about the beginning of the fifth century b.c. ני Deut. 16.14; 31.12 (the latter passage from a secondary, post-Exilic stratum of D.). « Zech. 14.16-21.</page><page sequence="60">60 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [60] lators, whether RD, H or P, would have deliberately restricted the performance of this particular rite only to native Jews.'4 However, putting aside for the present the question, what the original reading of v. 42b may have been,93 whether the present reading or that which Bertholet proposes, the fact re mains that this half-verse unmistakably represents the dwelling in booths, not as a secondary, but as the primary rite of the festival celebration; for otherwise why the repetition of the charge, with the manifest implication that this dwelling in booths is a rite mandatory for at least every native Jew? Moreover, as we have just seen, the term אזרח, with the far-reaching and significant implication inherent in it, of the distinction between native Jew and proselyte, occurs in no Hexateuchal source other than P. Furthermore, the unity of v. 43a with v. 42b can scarcely be gainsaid. And in this verse the expression, דרתיכם, is found in the Hexateuch only in P, while the idea that the import of a rite or ceremony of Judaism must be impressed upon future generations, in order, of course, to hold them loyal to the religion of their fathers, is characteristic only of secondary, post-Exilic strata of D and of P. We are compelled to conclude, therefore, that the whole of vv. 42b-43a is either RP or else in some way closely related to RP, as we shall see more clearly somewhat later. But this leaves v. 42a hanging more or less in the air. More over, it is significant that this command to dwell in booths during the festival period is separated from the main festival prescrip tion of H, contained in the nucleus of vv. 39-41a, by the easily recognized editorial colophon in v. 41b, which RP frequently inserts into the original legislation of H96 to indicate the con elusion of the legislation dealing with some one particular theme. The clear implication of this colophon here is that with v. 41a the original H legislation for the festival is ended. It is therefore disturbing indeed to find v. 42a appended after the colophon. 4י P in particular, since he does permit the circumcised proselyte topartici pate in the celebration of the Passover (Ex. 12.48; Num. 9.14; cf. also, 15.14 16). »5 For the actual solution of this problem cf. below, pp. 140-142. »6And also of Pt; cf.

This conclusion of the secondary character of v. 42a finds some further confirmation in the consideration that while the reference to the seven days of sojourn in the booths may hardly be termed superflous, it does smack of needless re dundancy after the sufficiently explicit statement of H in v. 39a/3, that the festival celebration should endure for seven days. It is therefore impossible to escape the conclusion that v. 42a too can not be H, but must be secondary. But this carries with it the additional conclusion that while, as has been said, the original H legislation for the festival could not have been unacquainted with the practice of dwelling in booths, it did not apparently regard it as a basic festival rite, the observance of which had to be provided for by specific legis lation; nor did it link in any way the ceremony with the four plants with the making and dwelling in booths. But if so, then the H legislation could scarcely have designated this festival by the name סכות; for unquestionably this name implies that dwelling in booths was the distinctive rite of the entire celebration of this festival. And it is significant indeed, and perhaps final confirma tion of the correctness of our conclusion that v. 42a is secondary and RP, that actually the authentic H legislation for the festival does not employ the name סכות even once, but instead desig nates the festival in v. 39a/3 as חג יהוה, one of the character istic ancient names of this particular festival.97 In the light of 97 That the motivation of the ceremony of dwelling in booths in v. 43a is unhistorical, and that in all likelihood these booths were in origin those in which the people had been dwelling throughout the spring and summer during the entire harvest season, is almost self-evident. This conclusion is strength ened greatly by the implications of the original H supplementary dating of the festival, "at the gathering in of the harvest" (v. 39a; cf. Ex. 23.16b [RD; cf. M 7, 74]; Deut. 16.13), and of the ancient name of the festival, חג האסיף, "Festival of Ingathering." In other words, the festival was celebrated originally while the people were still busily engaged in performing the very last acts of</page><page sequence="62">62 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [62] all this evidence, we must regard the whole of vv. 42-43a as secondary and a unit, the work of one and the same post-H leg islator and editor. And from this we must draw the further infer ence that the H legislators did not explicitly command the dwel ling in booths as a basic festival rite, even though there is no the agricultural year, and while normally they were still dwelling in booths in the fields and vineyards. But, on the one hand, this points to the earlier date for the festival, VII/3-9, rather than VII/15-21; and, on the other hand, it makes clear the necessity for the later insistence, through appropriate leg islation, upon the ceremonial observance of what had been originally a simple, natural and incidental folk-custom, and also why the people were required to dwell in booths for seven days, although there were actually eight days of festival celebration. For originally no doubt the people continued to dwell in their booths in the fields and vineyards during the seven days of the Festival of Ingathering proper, but on the eighth day, the New Year's Day, in connec tion with the peculiar and significant rites of that day, they probably forsook these temporary, harvest season quarters and returned to their regular and permanent houses in the villages for the rainy, winter period, soon to begin. This migration from summer to winter quarters may well have been a regular folk-custom connected with the observance of the ancient New Year's Day. Furthermore, under the old calendar, when the seven days of the Festival of Ingathering preceded the New Year s Day immediately, and also fell actually within the very last moments of the harvest season, there was no necessity whatever for emphasizing the dwelling in booths as a positive and mandatory rite. It was a natural and pleasant folk-custom and altogether incidental to the celebration of the Festival of Ingathering. But in the later period, partie ularly after the transfer of the festival to VII/15-21, two full weeks after the New Year's Day, when it no longer had any direct connection with the dwelling in booths during the harvest season, and the people had no doubt already taken up their abodes for the rainy season in their houses in the villages, then necessarily the formal command had to be given that during the festival the people must dwell in booths. But these were no longer the natural booths in the fields and vineyards, but were instead artificial booths erected merely for the celebration of the festival in the courtyards or on the roofs of the houses or in the streets or open squares of the villages and towns. Manifestly too the necessity now arose of accounting for the celebration of the festival by dwelling in these artificial booths, and so gradually the tradition evolved and eventually found written record in v. 43a here, that these booths commémora ted the manner in which Yahweh had provided shelter for His people in the desert after bringing them forth from Egypt. Unquestionably this was a gradual process and went hand in hand with the change in the name of the festival from חג האסיף, "Festival of Ingathering," or the simple ,חג יהוד, "Festival of Yahweh," to חג הסכות, "Festival of Booths."</page><page sequence="63">[63] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 63 indication that they had any occasion to forbid what was un questionably an ancient folk-practice. But manifestly to them the ceremony with the four plants was the essential festival rite, and in consequence the only rite which they commanded ex plicitly. Finally, one single word in w. 39-43 merits consideration, the little particle אך at the beginning of v. 39, introducing the paragraph of Sukkot legislation. This particle we are inclined to retain for H, though more for subjective reasons than because of demonstrable proof, and also because we would link it upwith the same particle which introduces the legislation for Yom Kip pur in vv. 27-32. We have seen that the account of the célébra tion of the Sukkot festival in Neh. 8, must have been based largely upon this H legislation here. Now it is significant that Neh. 8.18 records the celebration of an eighth day, following immediately upon the close of the celebration of the seven days of the festival. It is there called עצרת and its celebration is de scribed as being in accordance with custom or rule. We have endeavored to show elsewhere98 that the last two words of the Deut. 16.13, which undoubtedly belongs to the original stratum of D (Deut. 16.16 belongs to a secondary stratum; so also Ex. 23.17; 34.23; cf. M 7, 73-79), seems to indicate that this transformation began with Dl, in 621 b.c. But there is no assurance that the term חג הסכות there is not a late, editorial sub stitution for the original חב האסיף. The dating of the festival there in the ancient manner, באספךמגרנך ומיקבך (it is not at all improbable that the phrase, בצאת השנה, occurred originally in Deut. 16.13 also, just as in Lev. 23.41a, and stood immedi ately before באספך, and was eventually suppressed by later P2 editors after the introduction of Calendar III, with its new and precise dating of the festivals), seems to corroborate this conclusion, while the further considerations, that the remaining Deuteronomic legislation for the festival, in vv. 14-15, makes no mention whatever of booths or of the necessity of dwelling in them during the seven days of the festival, and that it would undoubtedly have been a physical impossibility for all the people, gathered at the central sanctuary for the celebration of the festival, in accordance with the explicit provision of v. 15, to provide booths in which they might sojourn during the seven days of the festival, make this conclusion a practical certainty. Unquestionably Dl knew of this festival still by the old name, חג האסיף, and the new name, חג הסכות, did not evolve until some time later. And undoubtedly too Dl did not record the dwelling in booths as an essential rite of the festival. M 1, 34 f.</page><page sequence="64">64 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [64] verse represent a late Priestly modification of an earlier reading. Clearly, the term כמשפט refers specifically to the P legislation for the additional eighth day of the Sukkot festival in Lev. 23.36 and probably also in Num. 29.35-38." But certainly this manner of celebration of this eighth day did not accord at all with the character nor yet with the time of the celebration of the seven days of the festival proper recorded in Neh. 8.14-17. For these reasons we have suggested that the word עצרת of Neh. 8.18 is an RP substitution for ראש השנה, which must have stood there originally.100 And if so, then this too must have been in accord ®י Cf. the characteristic use of the same expression in Lev. 5.10; 9.16; Num. 15.24; 29.18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 37 (all P passages); also I Chron. 15.13; II Chron. 4.20; 35.13. 10" This conclusion is confirmed by a study of the implications of the obvi ously technical term in biblical usage. The form עצרה seems to have been used specifically in the connotation, "festal assembly" (II Ki. 10.20; Joel 1.14; 2.15; pl., בעצרתיכם, Amos 5.21). In Jer. 9.1 עצרת occurs with the general mean ing, "assembly, band, group." In Lev. 23.36; Num. 29.35; II Chron. 7.9, all late Priestly or post-Priestly writings, עצרת refers specifically and technically to the additional eighth day of the Sukkot !festival upon VI1/22. Most sig nificant of all, however, is the use of עצרת in Deut. 16.8, applied to the seventh day of the Passover-Mazzot festival. It is noteworthy that here, precisely as in Lev. 23.36 and Num. 29.35, the command to observe this day as an עצרת is coupled with the explicit provision that no work must be performed upon it. Such a provision, implying that the day must be observed as a taboo-period, seems strange and out of place in Deuteronomic legislation, but accords alto gether with Priestly legislation. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the whole of Deut. 16.8b is, not D, but RP, substituted for some original Deuter onomic provision with regard to some rite performed upon the seventh day of the festival, probably the sacred dance (cf. Ex. 13.6b and also M 4, 47 f.), to which apparently late Priestly editors took exception, no doubt on the ground of its non-Yahwistic origin and character. Of course it may seem sur prising that D1 legislators should have retained this dance by the maidens upon the seventh day of the festival, since it is difficult to imagine that they too would not have been fully aware of its non-Yahwistic import; yet just such a procedure is not at all impossible even on the part of extreme Deuter onomic rigorists, for no reform movement, however drastic, can be absolutely consistent and thoroughgoing in all details. And indeed this conclusion is corroborated completely, and important new light is shed upon our general problem, by a determination of the original Deuteronomic formulation of Deut. 16.8. Sam. renders the verse: ששת ימים תאכל מצות וביום השביעי חג ליהוה אלהיך כל מלאכת עבודה לא תעשה. LXX apparently had before it the following text: ששת</page><page sequence="65">[65] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 65 with earlier H legislation which prescribed that on VII/10, the day following the close of the seven days of the Sukkot festival, the last seven days of the old year, the eighth day of actual festival celebration, the New Year's Day, was observed. ימים תאכל מצות וביום השביעי עצרת חג ליהוה אלהין לא תעשה בו כל מלאכה מלבד אשר תעשה לנפש. Quite a number of significant conclusions must be drawn from the comparison of these variant readings with the present text of MT. The first of these is that, precisely as we have surmised, חג must have stood in the original Deuteronomic law, for assuredly both Sam. and LXX could not have con ceived of this same term and inserted it here independently of each other. Moreover, as we have seen, the use of the term ,הג ליהוד, instead of ,חג יהוד, together with its specific limitation to one single day, instead of to the entire duration of the festival, indicates that here חג is used, not in the general mean ing, "festival," but in its primary sense, "a sacred dance," precisely as in Ex. 13.6. Unmistakably then the original Deuteronomic formulation of Deut. 16.8b read simply and with clear implication, וביום השביעי חג ליהוה אלהיך, or perhaps even with the last word omitted, in which case the original text here would agree exactly with that of Ex. 13.6b. It is clear, therefore, just as we have contended, that עצרת here is a sub stitution for the original חג, precisely as, as we have likewise contended, in Neh. 8.18 עצרת is a late substitution for the original ראש השנה. Moreover, the clause, לא תעשה מלאכה, at the end of the verse is the regular accompaniment of the Priestly technical term עצרת. Its insertion served to make out of what had been originally a day of merrymaking and folk-celebration an austere day of taboo and abstention from work. Manifestly this revision of the original Deuteronomic formulation of the law was the work of Priestly editors. And that they were very late Priestly editors, probably from the time of the Chron icier, i.e., about 300 B.C. or shortly thereafter, is evidenced by the facts that, on the one hand, the same change has been made in Neh. 8.18 as here, and, on the other hand, that, while LXX had עצרת already in the text before it, Sam. manifestly did not as yet read the word here, even though it does record in its version the command not to do any work upon the seventh day. Apparently the application of the technical term עצרת to the seventh day of the Passover Mazzot festival by late Ρ editors followed upon its reinterpretation by them as a day of abstention from work. In this they may well have been influenced by analogy with their additional, eighth day of celebration of the Sukkot festival, also a day of abstention from work and an עצרת, an ίξόδίον, i. e., "the closing day of the festival." But having thus reconstructed the original Deuteronomic reading of v. 8b, another difficulty arises immediately. This seventh day of the festival must have been, according to the original Deuteronomic program, a day of rejoicing and merry-making, certainly therefore a day of eating and drinking. It is disturbing therefore to find that the first half of the verse prescribes that the</page><page sequence="66">6666 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [66] And of course this original H legislation for the New Year's Day must have stood originally here in the H nucleus of Lev. 23, and logically must not have preceded, as at present, but have followed immediately upon the H legislation for the Sukkot festi val. This H legislation for the New Year's Day must have pro vided for the celebration of this occasion upon VII/10, and no doubt likewise recorded the basic rites of the celebration of the day which H sanctioned. Naturally this paragraph has been lost entirely or almost entirely, both because of the later Priestly reorganization of the H calendar and the changed relative order and dating of the festivals and also because of the late Priestly shifting of the New Year's Day to VII/1 and its reinterpretation of VII/10 as Yom Kippur. Originally, however, we may be cer tain, the paragraph of the H legislation, dealing with the Sukkot mazzot should be eaten for only six days. Certainly it did not mean to imply that already upon the seventh day, still within the limits of festival célébra tion, the people might resume the eating of leaven. Such an assumption is all the more impossible since in all other Passover-Mazzot legislation throughout the Bible, and even here in v. 3a/3 (though this portion of the verse is in all likelihood RD rather than Dl), the period during which the mazzot were commanded to be eaten is invariably fixed at seven days, and never at six days, as here. Manifestly we would expect here שבעת instead of the present ששת. The latter reading, however, seems at first glance confirmed by the fact that both Sam. and LXX likewise read ששת. But it is extremely significant that in Ex. 13.6 for שבעת of MT both Sam. and LXX read ששת. That שבעת was original here is definitely proved by the reading שבעת הימים, with the article, in v. 7 (so also Baentsch, Handkommentar), and by the fact that in this latter v both Sam. and LXX likewise read שבעת. Manifestly then the ששת of both Sam. and LXX in v. 6 is dependent upon an original Hebrew text which had already changed the original שבעת of v. 6 to ששת. Fortunately this change was not made systematically in all extant manuscripts, and our present MT reading must have come down to us from an original manuscript in which this change had not been made. But if an attempt was made by Jewish scribes, presumably of the late Priestly school, to change the original שבעת of Ex. 13.6, dealing with the legislation for the Passover-Mazzot celebration, to ששת, then it is reason able to assume that the very disturbing and in MT anomalous ששח of Deut. 16.8a is likewise a substitution for an original שבעת here, precisely what we would expect, and a substitution made by those same late Priestly editors who, as we have seen, revised the second half of the verse so drastically. From all this it is clear that, beyond all question, the original Deuter onomic formulation of Deut. 16.8 must have read שבעת ימים תאכל מצות וביום השביעי חג ליהוה אלהיך, almost precisely as in Ex. 13.6.</page><page sequence="67">[67] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 67 festival, and beginning with Lev. 23.39 must have preceded the paragraph dealing with the celebration of VII/10, the present Lev. 23.26-32. Naturally practically the whole of this paragraph in its present form, dealing as it does with the celebration of Yom Kippur, is P. Yet possibly one slight fragment of the original H legislation may remain, viz., the few words in v. 27aa, giving the date of the festival. Here too we note the particle אך, easily explicable if we regard it as P and correlate it with the P legis lation immediately preceding, in w. 23-25, dealing with the celebration of VII/1,101 but far more significant if we bear in mind that the H legislation for the Sukkot festival undoubtedly originally preceded this paragraph immediately, and so correlate this particle אך with the original H legislation for that festival, observed on the seven days immediately preceding, i. e., VII/3-9. For the same reason the demonstrative הזה in v. 27aa becomes doubly significant, certainly of much larger import if referring back to the celebration of the seven-day Sukkot festival on VII/3-9 than if to the colorless day of proclamation of taboo on VII/1. For these reasons we are inclined to retain v. 27aa for H, but with ראש השנה substituted for the present יום הכפרים הוא, although we must admit that the evidence for this last infer ence is far from certain or conclusive. 101 Note that even here the name ראש השנה is not yet applied to this day. This indicates probably that this P legislation here is introducing an innova tion in thus emphasizing the sanctity of VII/1, and that the process of the transfer of the New Year's Day to this day from VII/10 was slow and gradual. This conclusion is confirmed by the realization that v. 24b/3 is overloaded and syntactically impossible. The three nominal phrases there can hardly be in apposition with each other, nor can all three be predicates of the verb. The clause, מקרא קדש יהיה לכם, is repeated so often in the P stratum of this chapter that we can not doubt that מקרא קדש is the primary and original term here. But if we grant that זכרון תרועה is secondary and RP, then we must conclude that the identification of this day, VII/1, with the New Year's Day, with its characteristic rite of proclaiming the new year by the blowing of the shofar (cf. Lev. 25.9 [H]; Ps. 81.4b; also Finesinger, "Musical Instruments in the O.T.,"O.T.,"O.T.," HUCA, 111(1926] 59 f.; "The Shofar," HUCA, VIII-IX [1931-1932], 198 ff.), must likewise be secondary and quite late. (For the exact implication of מקרא קדש cf. my article, "Two Compound Technical Terms in Biblical Heb rew," JBL, XLIII [1924], 314-320.)</page><page sequence="68">68 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [68] However, the realization of the general fact that vv. 39-41, or even 39-43, as we shall see in due time, originally stood in H where vv. 23-36 now stand, solves conclusively one of the colophon problems here, viz., that of vv. 37-38, and rounds out our chain of evidence confirming this general conclusion. As we have seen, P2 editors substituted their legislation for VII/1, Yom Kippur and Sukkot for the original H legislation for Sukkot on the last seven days of the year and for the New Year's Day upon VII/10, retaining only, as we have suggested, v. 27aa of the original H legislation. To their revised calendar legislation they appended the proper colophon in their customary manner, in vv. 37-38, and with this completed their statement of their program of festival celebration based upon their revision of the original H festival calendar. But this original H legislation, thus suppressed by these P2 editors, was not lost altogether. In due time some later P2 editor, likewise in quite characteristic manner, appended to the already completed P2 statement of the festi val program that portion of the original H festival legislation which dealt with the Sukkot festival, with, however, the 'in sertion of vv. 39aa (-39 ,(אךb, and likewise with the change of the original H בצאת השנה to the present בשנה in order to avoid conflict with the P2 dating of the festival in v. 34.IM IM Still further corroboration of the conclusion that v. 41a read originally שבעה ימים בצאת השנה may possibly be found in the consideration of the impor tant statement in v. 41b!S that the festival must be celebrated in the seventh month. Unless we assume that the editorial colophon in v. 41ba comes a few words too early, we must conclude that v. 4lb/3 is likewise RP2. But if so, it would be surprising to find the dating of the festival in the seventh month repeated after the already explicit RP2 dating in v. 39aa. Moreover, the vague dating, "in the seventh month shall ye celebrate it," without fixing the precise date or period within the month, does not conform at all with the customary, punctiliously exact dating characteristic of RP2. Presumably therefore the RP2 dating of the festival in this unusual manner had some specific purpose. And if we assume that v. 4lb/3 was appended here at a time when the word בצאת still stood in v. 41a, we can understand its full import. It must have been inserted at the time when the New Year's Day was in process of being trans ferred from VII/10 to VII/1. With the prescription in v. 41a that the Sukkot festival was to be observed on the last seven days of the old year, this change of the date of the New Year's Day to VII/1 would have necessitated, of course, the transfer of the date of the Sukkot festival to the last seven days of the</page><page sequence="69">[69] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 69 In this manner vv. 39-43 came to follow the colophon in vv. 37-38.103 With all this the evidence is absolute that in the H calendar, and likewise still in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah, the Sukkot festival at least was celebrated on VI1/3-9. And in such case it follows of necessity, without the need of further proof, that the New Year's Day must have been celebrated on VII/10. Just this is the testimony, as we have seen, of Lev. 25.9.104 This concludes what is apparently all that we may learn at present of the festival calendar of H.105 But it is by no means insignificant. It demonstrates clearly that the Holiness Code, in both its primary and its secondary strata, knew only what we have designated as Calendar II, with the New Year's Day upon VII/10, with the Sukkot, or rather the Asif festival falling upon the seven days immediately preceding, VII/3-9, the last seven days of the old year, with the Mazzot festival celebrated as in the pre-Deuteronomic period, during the week from Sunday through Saturday in which the spring equinox occurred, and with the Passover, inseparably linked with the Mazzot festival, celebrated accordingly upon the Saturday night preceding the Sunday morning upon which the Mazzot festival began, i. e., sixth month. But to these P2 editors this must, for one reason or another, have seemed impossible. Accordingly they appended this statement, and that in a rather awkward place, after the colophon, that the Sukkot festival must con tinue to be celebrated in the seventh month, as of old. The next and practically simultaneous step must have been the omission of בצאת from v. 41a, and, fol lowing logically no doubt immediately upon this, the final fixing of the date of the Sukkot festival upon VII/15-21. נ" The complete solution of the problem of the seemingly illogical position of the colophon in v. 41b, preceding vv. 42-43, must be sought in a somewhat different direction, as will be shown later (below, pp. 135-143). 104 H2, and therefore additional proof that the celebration of the New Year's Day upon VII/10 persisted for at least some little time after the com position of HI, i. e., undoubtedly well into the fifth century b.c., in other words, to the time of Ezra and Nehemiah. 105 As the result of our analysis we would assign to H only the following portions of Lev. 23; vv. 10b-ll (- 14 ,(לרצנבםaa-y, 15a, 16, 17aab, 20aa (- אתם 39 ^(על הלחםa (- השביעי 40 ,(בחמשהa, 41a, 43b.

This much is beyond all question. This represents, it is plain, a slight modification of Calendar II, as first framed by the Deuteronomic reformers, a shifting of the date of the combined Passover-Mazzot festival, and with this, in consequence, of the Shabuot festival also, and likewise an apparent revival of the New Year's Day celebration upon its ancient day in the solar year, the day of the fall equinox, now VII/10, VII/10, according to the system of enumerating the months under Calendar II, and with this a revival of the celebration of the Asif festival upon its old, traditional date, VII/3-9, the last seven days of the old year. If we may fix the date of the primary stratum of H, as we believe we must, between 539 and 516 b.c., and that of H2 between 516 and 485 B.C., then it is clear that, just as we have contended elsewhere,106 Calendar II, with its dating of the festi vais according to the H scheme, was in use in Israel at least down approximately to the time of Ezra and Nehemiah. And granting this, then there is no reason whatever to question the interpréta tion which we have put upon Neh. 8 and the dating of the Sukkot festival and the New Year's Day there.10' 106 M 1, 28-35. 10ל pUrther corroboration of this conclusion may be found in the following considerations. Unquestionably the reading of the Torah by Ezra to the people at the central sanctuary during the seven days of the Sukkot festival was in conformity with the legislation of Deut. 31.10-11. This legislation is explicit as to the precise time when the Torah was to be read to the people: "At the end of seven years, at the exact moment of the Sabbatical year, at the Sukkot festival." Steuernagel (Handkommentar to the passage) has correctly interpreted מקץ שבע שנים as "at the end of every seven year period." Quite clearly the pass age means, "At the end of every seven year period, (which would, of course, be at the very end of the year), at the exact moment when the Sabbatical year sets in, on the Sukkot festival." The implication of the passage is certainly not that which Rashi, naturally dating the Sukkot festival two weeks after the actual beginning of the year on Rosh Hashanah, mistakenly attributes to it, viz., "in the eighth year, the first year of the new Sabbatical period." Here</page><page sequence="71">[71] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 71 It is clear too that the festival provisions in the H legislation represent, at least to a considerable degree, if not primarily, a reaction against and an abrogation of the Deuteronomic program of centralization of the observance of these festivals at the central sanctuary. Instead the H legislation apparently sanctioned anew the celebration of the three festivals at the home or in the field, as the case may be, and with rites, many of which apparently the Deuteronomic legislation had sought to abrogate completely because of their manifest non-Yahwistic origin and character. Certain of these rites this H legislation now sanctioned, but in a simple form of observance, which retained but little of the old, non-Yahwistic implications, and which was therefore readily harmonizable with the Yahweh-cult. And along with this, so it seems, the H legislation abolished all animal sacrifice as an integ ral part of the celebration of the three festivals,108 and by this act apparently divorced the celebration completely from the central sanctuary, if such there was in this period, or from local shrines, and completed its program of centering the observance of these festivals in the home and field. In this process, it is clear, unquestionably the command is to read the Torah to the people during the Sukkot festival which comes during the last seven days of the sixth year of the Sabbatical period and which culminates with the celebration upon the eighth day, the New Year's Day of the Sabbatical year. The correctness of this interpretation is confirmed by the following considerations. Kittel main tains, and no doubt correctly, that the incident recorded in Neh. 8 was the first official act of Ezra after his arrival in Jerusalem in 458 B.c. (Geschichte des des Volkes Israel, III [1929], 588 ffi). According to Zeitlin {Megittat Taanit, III; "The Tobias Family," Proceedings of the American Academy of Jewish Research,Research, IV[1932-1933], 172, 204) the Jewish years corresponding to 332-331 b.c. and 164-163 b.c. were Sabbatical years (cf. also Schiirer, Geschichte des jûdischendes jûdischendes jûdischen Volkes im Zeitalter Jesu Christi, I ,35 י). But if so, then the Jewish year corresponding to 458-457 b.c. must likewise have been a Sabbatical year. Accordingly it follows that, just as we have claimed, Ezra merely con formed to the law in Deut. 31.10-11. But this in turn confirms our contention that still in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah, just as is implied also in Deut. 31.10-11, the Sukkot festival was celebrated upon the last seven days of the old year, immediately preceding the New Year's Day, and that accordingly in Neh. 8.18 עצרת can not be original, but must be a late, RP substitution for an original ראש השנה. 108 Except no doubt the Paschal lamb, a purely household sacrifice; cf, above, note 48.</page><page sequence="72">72 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [71 it accommodated itself in practical manner to the strong reaction to the rigorism of the Deuteronomic Reformation which, as we have seen, had set in almost immediately after the death of Josiah in 608 B.c. S© much for the festival calendar of H. IV The Calendar of P At first glance it might seem that the calendar system of P can be formulated easily. Apparently Gen. 7.11; 8.3-4 indicate that in the P calendar system a month consisted of thirty days, just as in the older calendar.10' Also Gen. 8.14 in conjunction with these verses, on the one hand, indicates that the P writers were fully acquainted and reckoned with a solar year of three hundred and sixty-five days110 and, on the other hand, the fact that this solar year of three hundred and sixty-five days was reckoned from 11/17 of one year to 11/27 of the following year, seems to indicate likewise that in computing dates these P writers actually em ployed, not the solar, but the lunar year of three hundred and fifty-four or three hundred and fifty-five days. But in such a lunar year it is impossible that each of the twelve months should consist of thirty days, although, as we have seen, this is distinctly possible in a system of reckoning by solar years. This evidence seems to indicate therefore that everything is not quite as simple in the P calendar as might be anticipated, and that we find therein evidences of two different systems of reckoning time, one accord ing to solar years, with twelve months of thirty days each and some method of supplementing these by five additional days in the year, in other words the solar year of Calendar II and also 10« But cf. below, note 133. For evidence that the month of Calendar II equalled thirty days, cf. Deut. 21.13 with 34.8. Likewise from the expression ים?; rn; (11 Ki. 15.13) as a recognized measure of time it may be inferred that a a ירח consisted of an invariable number of days; and of course this would be only thirty. 110 The Book of the Secrets of Enoch, 14.1 (written between 30 b.c. and 70 A.D.; cf. Forbes and Charles, in Charles, Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the the Old Testament, II, 429) records even more precisely that a solar year con sisted of three hundred and sixty-five and a quarter days.</page><page sequence="73">[73] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 73 apparently of Calendar I, and the other system of reckoning time according to lunar years of three hundred and fifty-four or three hundred and fifty-five days, more probably the former, with twelve months of alternately thirty and twenty-nine days each, and, in all likelihood, with the intercalation of a month at certain intervals to harmonise the discrepancy between a period of lunar and solar years. Apparently too the festival calendar of P is recorded clearly and fully in the secondary strata of Lev. 23 and in Num. 28-29, with practically complete agreement between these two records, so that it would seem at first glance that there can be little ques tion about the P dating of the festivals. The P festival calendar recorded in these two passages differs radically from Calendar II. It is what we have termed Calendar III. In it the Passover is celebrated during the night of 1/14 while the Maz20t festival is celebrated from the morning of the fifteenth for seven days, i. e., until the morning of the twenty-second. The festival of First-fruits"1 is apparently still celebrated, as in the H calendar, 111 P apparently avoids the name Shabuot. At any rate in Lev. 23.15-21 the festival receives no name at all, while in Num. 28.26 it is called יום הבכורים, "Festival of First-fruits." True, in the same verse בשבעתיכם, "on your Shabuot," occurs, but the word is there redundant and altogether superfluous and even a bit awkward, and makes the distinct impression of a gloss. We have noted elsewhere (M 7, 73-77) that Ex. 23.16 (C) speaks of this festival as the חג הקציר, and that the term שבעת in Ex. 34.22 (K) is unquestionably a late edi torial substitution for the original הקציר. Likewise in Deut. 16.10 שבעות seems to be not original, but a substitute for הב^ו־ים in all likelihood; for the explana tory clause, whether original or a gloss, as it seems to be, stands at present entirely without syntactical connection, but would be perfectly comprehensible as in explanatory apposition with an original הבכרים. This leaves therefore Deut. 16.16 as the only passage in the entire Bible in which the name Shabuot (or השבעות; apparently שבעות is not yet a proper name) seems to be original. And even this is not at all certain; for it is noteworthy that Ex. 23.17 and 34.23, the parallels of this verse, lack the enumeration of the names of the three festivals. Deut. 16.16a/3 too may therefore be a late gloss. But even if it be original, we must conclude that the name שבעות or השבעות for the festival is quite late, since, as we have shown (M 7, 73-77), Ex. 23.17; 34.23, and with these, of course, Deut. 16.16, are all late, post-Exilic, RD expansions of the original text. We may therefore conclude that the name Shabuot was still unknown to the P authors of Lev. 23 and Num. 28-29.</page><page sequence="74">74 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [74] fifty days after the close of the Mazzot festival. On VII/1 a festi val is celebrated, called in Num. 29.1, יום תרועה, "day of blowing (the shofar)," and in Lev. 23.24 described as the day upon which there was זכרון תרועה, "a memorial or symbol of blowing." Eventu ally this day came in time to be regarded and celebrated as ראש השנה, the New Year's Day. That this specific name for this day is not employed in either Lev. 23 or Num. 29, nor, for that matter elsewhere in the latter portions of the Bible, but crops up only in post-biblical usage, is significant. Yet that the day was already in the P calendar on the way to recognition as the New Year's Day, if not actually so recognized by these P writers, even though they do not employ the specific name ראש השנה, is evidenced by the reference to the ceremony of blowing the shofar upon this day; for, as Lev. 25.9 indicates, the new year was regularly ush ered in by the ceremony of blowing the shofar. It may be inferred from this that here in these two P calendar records we catch the institution of the New Year's Day upon VII/1 as an innovation, just in process of becoming, and with the full evolution, and particularly the application to this day of the name ראש השנה, originally applied to the tenth of this month, not yet completed.112 Then upon VII/10 the former New Year's Day of Calendar II, the Day of Atonement was celebrated, a day of complete abstention from work and of self-affliction, mandatory for every body, with the penalties of excommunication113 for those who fail to afflict themselves and of destruction by the Deity for those still more obdurate persons who refuse to abstain from work. This day of extreme holiness was to be celebrated from evening to evening, from sunset of VI1/9 to sunset of VII/10. This exact defining of the precise moments at which the célébra tion of this day was to begin and to end in terms, as a moment's thought will show, of the earlier Calendar II is most significant. 112 So also in Ezek. 45.18-20, in assigning which to a post-Exilic, though a pre-Priestly, date I am in general agreement with Hôlscher (Ezechiel: Der DichterDichter u. das Buck, 201; cf. also below, note 166). VII/1 is one of the days of the semi-annual purification of the Temple, but it has not yet received the name ראש השנה. 113 That this is the implication of the punishment of ךז^ךת, cf. M 10, 16-58, and especially note 57 there.</page><page sequence="75">[75] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 75 For, on the one hand, it is clear that this holy day is meant to be celebrated only upon VII/10, and not partly upon VII/9 and partly upon VII/10. Clearly the day here extends from sunset to sunset. But then to further fix the precise limits of the period of celebration by saying that it extends from the evening of VII/9 to the next evening, whereas the actual implication is that the evening of VII/9 is really the first part of VII/10, means that for the sake of clarity the precise limits of the period of celebration are here stated in terms of Calendar II, which, still reckoning the day from morning to morning, would have counted the eve ning upon which the celebration of this day began as a part of VII/9. This indicates in turn that Lev. 23.32 is the product of the very period in which the transition from the older system of reckoning the day from morning to morning to the new system of reckoning the day from evening to evening, was being made.114 And finally the Sukkot festival is celebrated from VI1/15, the full moon day, through VII/21, and upon the day following, the eighth day of festival celebration, VII/22, comes the celebration of the additional and concluding day of this festival, called in both Lev. 23.36 and Num. 29.35 עצרת, and which has come in consequence to be designated in later Jewish parlance as שמיני עצרת. All this festival calendar of P seems fairly simple and clear. Yet many questions and problems are connected with it. We have seen that at a certain moment within the course of evolu tion of this calendar came the transition from the older system 114 Actually the original legislation for יום כפור here seems to end with v. 31; for v. 31b is the regular P closing colophon for legislation of this kind (above, note 103). Moreover, v. 32 adds nothing whatever to the content of this legislation other than the precise dating of the period of celebration of this day, viz., from evening to evening. But if we grant that v. 32 is secondary to the remainder of the Yom Kippur legislation here, then it follows that the institution of Yom Kippur, relatively late though it was (M 1, 39-43, and below, p. 146), was none the less earlier than the introduction of the new system of reckoning the day from evening to evening, and that this must have been one of the last steps in the complete evolution of Calendar III in biblical times. This conclusion accords perfectly with and corroborates our former inferences from Ex. 12.18 as to the very late moment in the biblical period when this new system of reckoning the day was introduced. It would imply furthermore that in its initial stages Yom Kippur was celebrated from morning to morning.</page><page sequence="76">76 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [76| of reckoning the day from morning to morning to the younger system of reckoning it from evening to evening, and also that: this in itself brought about of necessity a certain redating of the various festivals, since the precise moment of the beginning of each had to be changed by half a day in order that it might now begin with the evening instead of, as formerly, with the morning. We have seen also that Ex. 12.18 records a late attempt by sec ondary P writers to modify the date of the celebration of the Mazzot festival by half a day so that, beginning now in the evening, it might be celebrated coincidentally with the Passover as one festival on the night of 1/14. Manifestly it was just this transition in the system of reckoning the day which brought about the complete and final identification and amalgamation of the originally independent Passover and Mazzot festivals. As we have seen, in Lev. 23.5-6 and Num. 28.16-17 they are still carefully distinguished and celebrated at different, though con tiguous, moments. These considerations make clear that this calendar of P represents really an evolutionary process instead of a simple, systematic reformulation, a growth over a period of time which was of extreme significance for the history of Juda ism; for it is self-understood that changes in the calendar so drastic as these could not have come about without potent causes of far-reaching import. This is even clearer in the consideration of the evolution of the dating of the New Year's Day within the Priestly Code itself, for here we must distinguish three successive stages. We have seen that in Calendar II the New Year's Day was celebrated upon VII/10, the day of the fall equinox, with the significant ceremony of the greeting at the open eastern gate of the Temple at Jerusalem of the first rays of the rising sun. This moment must have marked both the beginning of the day itself and of the new year.115 Now we have shown116 that Pg must still have known and observed the celebration of the New Year's Day upon VII/10, the day of the fall equinox, and with much these same ceremo nies ; for it represents the dedication of the tabernacle in the wilder ness and the consecration of Aaron and his sons, in literal accord "5"5 M 11. ■■י' M 1, 44-48.</page><page sequence="77">[77] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 77 with the historical tradition of the dedication of Solomon's Temple, as extending over a period of seven days and culminating upon the eighth day with the entrance into the new sanctuary of the כבוד יהוה, the theological equivalent in P and other post Exilic writings"7 of the first rays of the rising sun upon the day of the fall equinox, the New Year's Day. This act symbolized the entrance of Yahweh Himself into His new sanctuary and His taking up His permanent abode therein. And further, as a regular part of the ritual of the day, Nadab and Abihu, the two oldest sons of Aaron, in the function of chief priests, enter into the holy of holies into the very presence of the Deity."8 And still more, seemingly an attendant circumstance of the ritual of the day, Nadab and Abihu lose their lives through a flame coming forth from the fiery presence of the Deity."9 All these rites and incidents are inexplicable except as parts of the significant and complex ceremonial of the New Year's Day upon the day of the fall equinox, VII/IO.120 The evidence is ample therefore that Pg "י Cf. Ezek. 43.1 ff. and Mil, 34. 118 Cf. Zech. 3.1-7 and also the regular entrance of the high-priest into the holy of holies on Yom Kippur, coupled with the constant fear that he might not emerge therefrom alive (Yoma, VI; cf. Lauterbach, "A Significant Controversy between Sadducees and Pharisees," HUCA, IV [1927], 173-205); cf. also the entrance of the Patriarch of the Greek Church at Jerusalem into the traditional sepulcher of Jesus in the Church of the Sepulcher on the after noon preceding Easter Sunday, in connection with the ceremony of the des cent of the sacred fire. Upon the parallelism between, and even the complete identity of this significant ceremony with the old Temple rite of the coming of the first rays of the rising sun upon the day of the fall equinox, the New Year's Day, in other words the coming of the כבוד יהוה, I have commented already (M 8, 45 ff.; M 11, 34-37). The ceremony of the descent of the sacred fire in the Church of the Sepulcher at Jerusalem on the afternoon before Easter Sunday is, of course, the corresponding rite at the spring equinox, and is fur ther evidence of our oft-repeated contention that the Mazzot festival had originally a direct connection with the spring equinox. 11'Lev. 9.23-10.3; cf. also my article ,"On Leviticus 10.3," in the Paul HauptHaupt Anniversary Volume, 97-102. 110 Cf. also the import of the fact that the legislation which follows in Pg immediately upon this account of the death of the two sons of Aaron is that for Yom Kippur in Lev. 16.

From all this evidence it is clear that Pg itself still operated with Calendar II, and that the transition to Calendar III did not begin until after the com position of Pg, and that therefore all passages in P which record details of Calendar III must be P2."1 This conclusion is confirmed by the fact which we have noted already,122 that while P2 fixes the date of the New Year's Day upon VII/1, it does so apparently rather hesitatingly and with the distinct consciousness that it is an innovation. Therefore it does not yet venture to apply the term ראש השנה, "New Year's Day," to this day, but speaks of it merely as the "day of blowing (the shofar)" or the day upon which there was "a memorial of blowing." With this P2 calendar which fixes the New Year's Day upon VII/1,VII/1, we must, as we have seen, link the rest of the festival calendar which we find in the P stratum of Lev. 23 and in Num. 28-29, viz., the Sukkot festival proper upon VII/15-21, with eventually the additional, colorless eighth day of festival observ ance, Shemini Azeret, with the Passover upon the night of 1/14 and the Mazzot festival beginning the next morning, the fifteenth, and continuing to the morning of the twenty-second, and with the Festival of First-fruits still celebrated upon the fiftieth day following the Sabbath of the Mazzot week. This is Calendar III. We must accordingly, it is clear, regard Calendar III, even in these, its first stages, as the creation of P2 legisla tors. Furthermore, as we have seen, this Calendar III was the product of a slow and gradual evolution, a natural growth, re quiring a certain, adequate period of time for it to pass through the early stages of its evolution and reach even the form recorded "י This fact, that Pg itself still operated with Calendar II, and therefore was not acquainted wth the later dating of the Sukkot festival of Calendar III, from VI1/15 through VII/21, confirms still further our interpretation of Neh. 8 and of the dating of the Sukkot festival and of Rosh Hashanah there. 122 Above, p. 74.</page><page sequence="79">[79] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 79 in Lev. 23 and Num. 28-29, rather than the formulation of a single moment in a definite reform program, such as, as we have learned, Calendar II seems to have been. This process of the evolution of these first stages of Calendar III must have extended over a period of at least a half to a full century; and since even its beginnings were still unknown to Pg and it is in its entirety the product of P2, we may well fix the period of these first stages of the evolution of Calendar III as the first two thirds of the fourth century B.C., i. e., until the end of the Persian period. Earlier than this we may not set it; but, on the other hand, we can hardly set it much later. The initial stage of this early evolutionary process seems to have been the transfer of the New Year's Day from VII/10to VIVI1/1, and correspondingly of the Sukkot festival from VII/3-9 to VII/15-21. The next, or even a simultaneous, step was the transfer of the Passover from the new moon night of the first month to the night of the fourteenth,123 and of the Mazzot festival to the week beginning the next morning, the fifteenth, and con tinuing to the morning of the twenty-second. No specific date seems to have been fixed for the Festival of First-fruits, but apparently it continued for quite some time124 to fall upon the fiftieth day after the Sabbath of the week of the Mazzot festival. But inasmuch as the date of the Mazzot festival had itself been shifted, the actual date of the Festival of First-fruits must also have been changed correspondingly. These seem to have been the initial stages in the evolution of Calendar III. A secondary stage in this process was apparently the institu tion of the eighth day of celebration of the Sukkot festival, resulting, so we have concluded, from the persistent and inerad icable reminiscence on the part of the people that there had actually been, not merely seven, but eight days of celebration in connection with the Sukkot festival.125 123 A process undoubtedly furthered by the transfer in the H calendar, already noted, of the Passover from the new moon of the first month to the night preceding the beginning of the Mazzot festival, somewhat later in that month. 124 Below, pp. 95 f. "5 M 1, 38 ff.</page><page sequence="80">80 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [80] And seemingly the final stage in this first part of the evolution of Calendar III, as recorded in Lev. 23 and Num. 28-29, was the institution of Yom Kippur upon VII/10. As we have suggested,123 this too was, in all likelihood, the result of the persistent reminis cence on the part of the people that VII/10 had been of old a day of extreme and peculiar sanctity, celebrated with specific rites, some of which, such as the dances of the maidens in the vineyards and the sending away of the scapegoat to Azazel, had persisted ineradicably in the folk-practice and now received more or less formal sanction and a thinly-disguised Yahwistic veneer.126 The very fact that both of these secondary stages in the evolu tion of Calendar III seem to have been the result of persistent and ineradicable reminiscence may well confirm our conclusion that this entire first period of the evolution of Calendar III was not of too long duration, certainly, as we have suggested, not of much more than a half to two-thirds of a century. Assuredly by the middle of the fourth century b.c., and certainly before the end of the Persian and the beginning of the Greek periods, these first stages in the complete evolution of Calendar III were fin ished. And during this entire period and throughout this entire portion of this evolution, as we have seen, the day was still reck oned from morning to morning. But we have seen also that still later changes and modifica tions of the calendar are recorded in the Bible, all in manifestly very late secondary strata of P. One of these, already considered "6 In other words, it is clear, something of the same spirit of harmoniza tion and compromise with ancient and deep-rooted folk-customs, despite their patently non-Yahwistic, Canaanite origins, which, as we have seen, animated both the H and Pt legislators of a century and a half before, continued to influence these P2 legislators of the fourth century b.c. Various considéra tions, into which, however, we may not enter here, indicate that these later P2 legislators were not at all, general scholarly opinion to the contrary not withstanding, the same extreme rigorists and particularists as were Ezra and Nehemiah. Instead, in the period following 400 b.c. or thereabouts, a gradual amelioration of the extreme particularism of those two leaders of a generation before seems to have set in, which found its expression in both Pg and P2. This represents a reaction against the extreme particularism of Ezra and Neh emiah quite comparable to, though not as far-reaching as the reaction of the H legislators against the extremes of the Deuteronomic Reformation which we have already noted.</page><page sequence="81">[81] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 81 in detail, was the change in the method of reckoning the day from evening to evening instead of from morning to morning, as of old, with the consequent changes in the dating of the festivals, and particularly the joint Passover-Mazzot festival, now from the eve of 1/15 to the eve of 1/22. And with this, and as another step in the gradual evolution of Calendar III, went the very obvious effort to transfer the date of the New Year's Day from VII/1 VII/1 to 1/1. This matter too we have discussed briefly elsewhere127 and have shown that the implication of the explicit statement of Ex. 12.2 that the first month128 should be regared as the first of the months of the year must be that the New Year's Day was to be celebrated upon the first of that month ;129 for otherwise there would be no point whatever to the statement that this month or this new moon should be regarded as the "head" of the months or new moons, that it should be the first of the months of the year. This conclusion is borne out by the peculiar terminology in Ex. 40.2, "On the day of the first new moon,130 on the first of the month." Here it is self-apparent that the day begins with the evening. Ex. 40 is generally recognized as P2; and that it is very late P2 is established by the following evidence. In this chapter the dedication of the tabernacle in the wilderness is trans ferred from the old New Year's Day upon VII/10 to 1/1. And with this the essential details of the dedication ceremony are "י M 1, 48-58. "8 Actually it is not stated until v. 18 that this is the first month, but that it is so is clear from the context and also from the fact that this is the month of the Passover and of the exodus from Egypt. The failure, however, to specify that this is the first month may perhaps indicate that even within the P stratum of Ex. 12, which, we have seen, is itself late P2, vv. 1-2 may themselves be secondary. 129 Not improbably in the term החדש הזה in v. 2 something of the idea, not merely of month, but also of new moon day is implied. In fact it is quite likely that, just as we have intimated above, this verse should be translated, "This new moon shall be for you the head or chief of new moons; first shall it be for you of the months of the year." '3° It is impossible to translate ביום החדש הראשון otherwise, because of the specific implication of ביום and also because of the further explanatory state ment, באחד לחדש. Here חדש, following upon ביום, can mean only "new moon," and not "month."</page><page sequence="82">82 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [82] transferred likewise. The כבוד יהוה, in the form of a fiery appari tion enveloped in "the cloud," enters the tabernacle and takes up its permanent residence within the 131.משכן This rite or pro cedure was, as we have seen, originally associated inseparably and characteristically with the day of the fall equinox, VII/10 of Calendar II, the old New Year's Day. Here the rite or pro cedure is transferred to 1/1, the day of the new moon immediately preceding the spring equinox.132 It is difficult therefore to avoid the conclusion that here 1/1 is regarded as the New Year's Day.133 131 Hence the specific name, משכן, "dwelling-place," found, in contradis tinction to the older term, אהל מועד, only in P2 ; cf. my "The Tent of Meeting," J AOS,J AOS,J AOS, 38 (1918), 133 f.J AOS, 38 (1918), 133 f. 13־ That 1/1 was itself actually the day of the spring equinox, cf. Charlier, "Ein astronomischer Beitrag zur Exegese des Alten Testaments," ZDMG, 58 (1904), 391. 133 I must here acknowledge and make correction of one rather significant error in my former treatment of this passage and its implications, in Ml, 48-58. There I stated that Ex. 40.2 and 17 represent the dedicatory rites as extending from 1/1 through 1/8, and then proceeded to discuss the significance of the period 1/1-8 as a religious period of especial importance in the practice of various Semitic religions. That this period did play a particular role in Semitic religion is clear from an abundance of evidence, only a small portion of of which I have presented in the above mentioned discussion. But with this the record in Ex. 40.2, 17, it must be admitted, has nothing to do directly. In both verses only the one date is mentioned, viz., 1/1. Whether the narrative meant to imply that the dedication rites extended over only this one day, is not clear. But inasmuch as all other traditions of the dedication of both the tabernacle in the wilderness and the Temple tell that the dedication ceremonies extended over a period of eight days of festival celebration, with the culmina ting rites upon the eighth day, we may safely infer that here too the implication is that there was an eight-day period of dedication, with these, the culminating rites upon the eighth day, the new New Year's Day, now celebrated upon 1/1. This conclusion is confirmed by a valuable bit of evidence, discussed in the afore-mentioned article (pp. 56-58), but the full import of which was not realized then. Ezra 6.15 states that the second Temple was completed on the third of Adar, while v. 19 clearly implies that it had been dedicated and put into regular use previous to Passover on 1/14. However, I Esdras 7.5 fixes the date of the completion of the Temple, not upon the third, but upon the twenty third of Adar. Unquestionably this is correct, and the numeral, עשרין, and with it the connecting particle, ו, have fallen out of Ezra 6.15. The obvious implica tion here is that during the eight days, beginning with the twenty-third of Adar and culminating and concluding on the first of Nisan, the ceremonies of the dedication of the Temple were performed. This, in turn, suggests almost irre</page><page sequence="83">[83] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 83 This conclusion is completely borne out by one additional bit of evidence derived from a careful analysis and interpretation of Lev. 25.20-22. Scholars have seen correctly that this passage deals, not with the Jubilee year, as do vv. 8-18, but reverts back to the Sabbatical year and is therefore, or at least seems to be, the direct continuation of vv. 1-7. Practically all modern scholars are agreed in assigning these verses to a secondary stratum of H. The verses raise the question, put into the mouth of the people, "What shall we eat in the seventh year? If we do not sow, then we can not gather in our crop." To this query comes the divine assurance, "but I shall command My blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it will bring forth the crop (sufficient) for three years. Then you shall sow in the eighth year and shall eat of the crop old grain; until the ninth year, until the gathering of its crop you shall eat*old grain." Scholars have apparently failed to see in the first place that there is a significant contra diction in spirit and thought between these verses and the main stratum of legislation for the Sabbatical year; for vv. 1-7 + 19 have already given positive assurance that the natural growth of the soil, which springs forth even though there has been no sowing during the preceding fall, will suffice completely for food for man and beast during the Sabbatical year, that therefore the people may feel confident that they shall dwell upon the land in plenty and security. After this very strong assurance of divine providence the doubt raised in v. 20 and the renewed divine futably that Ex. 40.2, 17 imply that the ceremonies of dedication of the taber nacle in the wilderness, according to these late P2 writers, extended from XII,/23j through 1/1. Manifestly too the chronological systems of the P2 authors of Ex. 40 and of the authors of Ezra 6.15 and I Esdras 7.5 were iden tical, further proof of the very late date of Ex. 40 and its calendar. In this connection note should be taken also of the significant fact that Ezra 6.15 designates the twelfth month by its Babylonian name, Adar, al though in v. 19, just as in Ex. 40.2, 17 the first month is still designated by number and not yet by name. It should be noted likewise that, according to the above reckoning, the twelfth month of Ex. 40.2, 17 and of Ezra 6.15 and I Esdras 7.5 must have consisted, not of thirty, but only of twenty-nine days, for only thus could the eight days of dedication begin on XI1/23 and end on 1/1. These are all characteristics of Calendar III in its very latest form.</page><page sequence="84">84 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [84] assurance seem incomprehensible and suspicious. This is, how ever, a matter of only secondary import. Far more significant is the reference in these verses to the fact that there will be no crop still during the eighth year, nor actually until the ninth, and that therefore the verses really imply that the crop harvested in the sixth year must suffice for three full years, until the crop, sown in the fall of the eighth year, shall ripen and be gathered in the spring of the ninth year, and that accordingly there would be, as we shall see shortly, not one, but two full years of practically complete cessation of agri cultural activity. Dillmann134 accounts for this condition by the assumption that these verses refer to both the Sabbatical and the Jubilee years together, the latter following immediately upon the former; and actually v. 11 does forbid agricultural activity in the Jubilee year, precisely as in the Sabbatical year. However, practically all modern scholars have recognized vv. 11-13 as secondary and harmonistic, though whether RH or RP is not at all certain. And there can be no question that these verses really misinterpret the true spirit and purpose of the Jubilee year, viz., to reunite impoverished and scattered families in free dom and to restore them to their ancestral estates and to eco nomic independence. With these purposes the command to abstain from agricultural activity in the Jubilee year, following immediately upon the Sabbatical year, could have little signifi cance. Rather we would expect that families just restored to their ancestral fields would begin immediately to till these fields in order to reestablish themselves economically as speedily as possible, for otherwise the very economic purpose basic to the concept of the Jubilee year would tend to be defeated. The sec ondary character of vv. 11-13 is beyond all question.135 Accord 134 Commentary, 667. 133 Moreover, it should be noted that v. 11 explicitly forbids the sowing of the seed in the Jubilee year. But v. 22 even more explicitly commands the sowing of the seed in the eighth year, which would, under Dillmann's hypo thesis, be, of course, the Jubilee year. This contradiction is self-evident and conclusive. It proves convincingly that w. 20-22 do not deal at all with the Jubilee year, as Dillmann maintained, and that the explanation of the refer ence to the eighth year must be sought in a different direction, and also that</page><page sequence="85">[85] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 85 ingly later scholars have rejected this explanation of Dillmann and seek to solve the problem by basing themselves upon a state ment of Wetzstein,136 that after a fallow year a field must be plowed three times before it will again begin to produce,137 and then drawing the inference that just this was the situation here. But the true explanation of the problem here is simpler and much more significant than this. It should take but a moment's thought to realize clearly that the basis of calculation in w. 20-22 is a year which begins, not in the fall, but in the spring. This is particularly evident from the explicit statement of v. 22, that the crop sown in the eighth year, in the fall of course, will ripen and be gathered and eaten only in the ninth year, again, of course, in the spring. Manifestly the eighth year ends and the ninth year begins in the interval between this sowing and this reaping, i. e., between the fall, which still comes within the eighth year, and the spring, which, in turn, comes within the ninth year. Obviously the beginning of the year here must be reckoned from the beginning of the spring. The full import of this system of reckoning the year and of the relation of these three verses thereto will become clear from vv. 11-13, despite their secondary character, still presume a year beginning in the fall, and not in the spring, as, as will become clear very shortly, w. 20-22 do. Moreover, II Ki. 19.29 and Is. 37.30 show how exceptional, irregular, and portentous was the condition of two successive years in which the fields were not tilled. 136 In Deiitzsch, Isaiah (2nd ed.), 389 f. So Nowack, Archdologie (1st ed.), 164, note 2; Baentsch, Handkommentar; Bertholet, Handkommentar. Actually the prevailing practice seems to be some what different than this. In the Hauran land incapable of irrigation is culti vated only every other year (Burckhardt, Travels in Syria and the Holy Land, 296). Petermann (Reisen im Orient, I, 179) found this same practice in vogue near Katana, south of Damascus. Among the semi-pastoral, semi-agricultural inhabitants of Arabia Petraea and adjacent districts, where agricultural me thods are naturally more primitive, Musil found the practice quite common of leaving the fields in this comparatively unfertile region lie uncultivated for three years in succession, with, however, an occasional superficial plowing in the summer (Arabia Petraea, III, 298). But it must be borne in mind that the inhabitants of this district are no true fellahin, but that their natural instincts incline rather to the semi-nomadic, pastoral life; nor is this country comparable to Palestine. Unquestionably the regular practice in Palestine was not to let a field lie fallow two years in succession.</page><page sequence="86">86 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [86] a comparison of the following two tables of sowing and reaping as they would obtain under the two different systems of reckoning the year: ï II Year Beginning in the Fall Year Beginning in the Spring FALL SPRING SPRING FALL 5th year sowing reaping reaping sowing 6th year sowing reaping reaping 7th year 8th year sowing reaping sowing 9th year sowing reaping reaping sowing These tables establish the following facts: according to Table II, the necessary procedure when the year began in the spring, the crop reaped in the spring, at the beginning of the new year, would have been sown the previous fall, in the latter half of the pre ceding year: thus, for example, the crop reaped in the spring of the fifth year would have been sown in the fall of the fourth year. Accordingly in the sixth year, the crop reaped in the spring would have been sown in the fall of the fifth year. But in the fall of the sixth year there would be no sowing since the crop which might be sown then, and which would not ripen until the spring of the seventh year, the Sabbatical year, could not be gathered during that year. Likewise in the fall of the seventh year there could be no sowing, just because in the Sabbatical year such labor was strictly forbidden ; consequently there could be no crop in the spring of the eighth year. The first positive agricultural activity which this sys tern of reckoning would permit therefore would be the sowing of the crop in the fall of the eighth year, which in turn could be gathered only in the spring of the ninth year. Just this is precisely what vv. 20-2220-22 state. It is clear accordingly just why it specifies that the crop of the sixth year, the crop gathered in the spring of that year, and which had been sown in the fall of the fifth year, would, through divine blessing, be so abundant as to last and suffice for three full years, until the gathering of the crop in the ninth year. It is clear too that under this system of reckoning the year from the spring, there would of necessity be, not one, but two com plete years of total cessation of agricultural labors. On the other hand, Table I shows with equal clarity that with</page><page sequence="87">[87] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 87 the year beginning in the fall there would be only one year of total cessation of agricultural activity, viz., the seventh year; for the crop sown in the fall of the sixth year, under this system of calendation the first half of the year, would be gathered in the spring, the second half of the same year. Then in the fall of the seventh year there would be no sowing, and in consequence in the spring of that same year there would be no reaping. But in the fall of the eighth year there would be sowing as usual, and the crop resulting therefrom would be harvested in the spring of that same year. It is self-evident from this interpretation of these two tables that the whole scheme of the Sabbatical year, as formulated by H legislators, presupposes a year which began in the fall, and not one which began in the spring, for certainly it contemplates, not two, but only one complete year of total cessation of agricultural activity. This is in fact clearly implied in the basic provision for the Sabbatical year in w. 3-7, and particularly in the explicit statement in v. 3, that for six years in succession they should not only sow their seed, but should also reap their crops. The com parison of Tables I and II shows that this procedure would be possible only with the year beginning in the fall, and that, with the year beginning in the spring there could be only five succès sive sowings and reapings within the Sabbatical period of years. Furthermore, w. 4-5 seem to imply that both sowing and reaping came within the same year, and again this would be possible only with the year beginning in the fall. From all this it follows indubitably that w. 20-22, which presuppose a year beginning in the spring, can not be an integral part of the original H legislation for the Sabbatical year. They must be the work of a late editor, who apparently had no real understanding of the nature and purpose of the Sabbatical year as originally instituted.138 And inasmuch as these verses presume 138 This conclusion is confirmed somewhat by another interesting consid eration. The concept underlying the assurance that there is no need for the people to worry about the means of their subsistence during the seventh and eighth years, because in the sixth year the Lord will provide a crop sufficient for all their needs until the harvest of the ninth year, is identical with that underlying the assurance in Ex. 16.4-36 that on the sixth day the Lord will</page><page sequence="88">88 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [88] a year beginning in the spring, we can not but correlate them with the P2 gloss in Ex. 12.2, which prescribes that the month in which the Passover falls shall be regarded as the first month provide enough manna for two days, the sixth day and the Sabbath, and until the gathering of the next supply of manna on the ensuing first day of the new week. The theology basic to the two passages is identical and stamps them as the work of one and the same author. And that Ex. 16.4-36 is of late P2 authorship is beyond all question; witness the fact that the assumption of the observance of the Sabbath here anticipates the basic legislation for the Sab bath in Ex. 20.8-11, just as correspondingly the assumption in vv. 32-34 of the tabernacle and of Aaron functioning therein as high-priest anticipates the legislation providing for these institutions in Ex. 25-30 and Lev. 8-9. Moreover, assuming this complete parallel between the theological moti vations of Ex. 16.4-36 and Lev. 25.20-22, it is difficult not to conclude that the Sabbatical year of Lev. 25.20-22 conformed to the same basic principle as did the Sabbath day of Ex. 16.4-36, viz., both were periods of complete abstention from work and physical labor by the people. To the P2 author of Lev. 25.20-22 the Sabbatical year was merely a projection over the entire seventh year of the principle of abstention from work on the seventh day. Actually, however, this was not at all the original basic purpose of the Sab batical year. That was designed, not to enforce complete cessation of labor on the part of the people, but rather in order to provide an opportunity for the land to rest, as it were, to lie unfilled and fallow during the last year of each period of seven years. This is the manifest implication of Ex. 23.10-11, the oldest biblical legislation for the Sabbatical year. In fact, as we have shown elsewhere (M 7, 92 f. ; M 9, 40 f.), those vv. do not yet assume one national Sabbatical year, observed simultaneously and uniformly by the entire people. This was rather one of the innovations of the Deuteronomic reformers, with their program of nationalization and centralization of worship and of life (Deut. 15.1-18). But under the older legislation of the Book of the Covenant the Sabbatical year was observed only with regard to individual fields. Every seventh year in the course of its tilling a field was allowed to lie fallow. But this was as yet no uniform year for the entire land, nor even, if by chance a man owned more than one field, necessarily a uniform Sabbatical year for all his fields. Manifestly the original underlying purpose of this institution was, not the resting of the people, but the resting of the land. And that this was still the basic purpose of the Sabbatical year under the original H legislation becomes clear from a careful analysis of Lev. 25.4-5. In the first place it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that these verses seem overloaded with references to the Sabbath and with the characteristic Priestly technical term, שנתון, "Sabbath observance through complete abstention from work." Moreover, ,שבת ליהוד in v. 4a, following immediately upon [שכת [שבתון יהיה לארץ, seems awkward at least, if not actually suspicious. These redundan cies of expression are, however, easily relieved if we regard שבתון and שבת ליהוד</page><page sequence="89">[89] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 89 of the year, that, in other words, the year shall be reckoned as beginning with the first month. We must correlate them likewise with Ex. 40.2, 17, where the clear implication is that the New Year's Day was celebrated upon 1/1. In consequence we must assign these verses here to late P2. We have then in Lev. 25.20-22 an additional biblical passage of late P2 origin recording a system of calendation in which the year was reckoned as beginning in the spring, and presumably therefore upon 1/1. The evidence of these three passages, Ex. 12.2; 40.2, 17; Lev. 25.20-22, coupled with Ezra 6.15,135 is decisive that quite late in v. 4a and all of v. 5b as RP. With these expressions removed the passage reads more smoothly and unifiedly. And its basic meaning and purpose become thereby all the clearer, that the Sabbatical year is still designed by the H leg islators to provide an opportunity for the land to rest. On the other hand, the RP insertion, שבחון in vv. 4a and 5b, emphasizes the principle, not of the resting of the land, but of abstention from work by the people; while the other RP insertion, שבת ליהוה in v. 4a, in turn seems to repeat the Priestly idea first ex pressed in Gen 2.3, that the Sabbath rest was in honor and an act of positive worship of Yahweh. Undoubtedly these insertions here are the work of the same P2 editor as are vv. 20-22, for they reflect precisely the same point of view. But these considerations bring to light another matter of interest in this study. It is clear that in Deut. 15.1-18 the Deuteronomic reformers sought not only to nationalize the institution of the Sabbatical year, to provide for its simultaneous and uniform observance throughout the entire country, but they endeavored likewise to socialize the institution, to disregard, and im pliedly thereby to abrogate, the old, agricultural implications of the Sabbati cal year and the resting of the land, and instead to emphasize the purely social implications, the old practice of the release of Hebrew slaves after seven years of servitude (Ex. 21.2-11; cf. M 9, 38-50) and the apparently new practice of the release of debts. Significantly, however, the H legislation for the Sabbatical year in Lev. 25 ignores completely these two Deuteronomic Sabbatical year procedures and reverts back to the pre-Deuteronomic, agricultural practice recorded in the Book of the Covenant, retaining, however, the Deuteronomic nationalization of the institution. This is obviously another instance where the H legislators consciously repealed earlier Deuteronomic legislation. Esth. 3.7 also manifestly assumes a year beginning on 1/1; but im pliedly this reflects Babylonian-Persian rather than specifically Jewish usage (so also Marti in EB, IV, 5367). Still one other passage in the Bible assumes in unique and most significant manner the observance of the New Year's Day upon 1/1. Careful consideration of Num. 7.89 shows unmistakably that this final verse of the chapter has no</page><page sequence="90">90 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [90] in the biblical period a strong effort was made to shift the New Year's Day to 1/1. With this, since it too is recorded explicitly direct connection with all that precedes immediately, but that instead it must have constituted the concluding verse of an older P account of the setting up and dedication of the tabernacle in the wilderness. It describes the final pro cedure of this ceremony, or rather the customary practice which followed im mediately thereon. The verbs within the verse must be construed in the fre quentative sense; "And whenever Moses would enter the 'tent of meeting' (notice the use here of the older term, אהל מועד, in contrast to the younger term, משכן, in v. 1) to speak with Him (Yahweh), he would hear the voice speaking to him from above the 'mercy-seat' (cf. M 8, 34 ff., note 41) which was upon the ark of testimony, from between the two cherubim, and it would speak to him." It is not at allcertain of just what preceding biblical passage this verse is the immediate continuation. Were it not for the use of the older term, אהל סועד, it would be tempting to link this verse on to Ex. 40.38. As it is, it seems best to regard the verse as the continuation (although perhaps with the loss of a few intervening verses) of Ex. 29.43, and probably as belonging to Pg. Vv. 1-88, on the other hand, must unquestionably be linked with the nar rative in Ex. 40. With this then they undoubtedly assume the celebration of the New Year's Day and the day of the setting up of the tabernacle in the wilderness and of the dedication of it and of the altar upon 1/1. But it is ex tremely significant that Num. 7.1-88 provide for twelve additional days of celebration of the dedication of the altar, each day marked by the sacrifice offered by the representative of one of the tribes, twelve days beginning upon 1/1 and extending therefore through 1/12. Despite the fact that we have had to fix the eight days of the dedication of the sanctuary of Ex. 40 as extending from XII/23 through 1/1, it is impossible not to correlate these additional twelve days of dedication of the altar with the celebration of the New Year's festival in Babylonia in honor of Marduk on the first eleven days of Nisan, the first month of the Babylonian calendar (cf. Zimmern, in KAT&gt;, 370 f.; "Bab ylonische Vorstufen der vorderasiatischen Mysterienreligionen," ZDMG, 76 [1922], 52 f. ; Meissner, "Die gegenwartigen Hauptprobleme d. assyriologischen Forschung," ibid., 93). That due cognizance of this Babylonian festival period was taken by late, post-Exilic biblical tradition, if not also by actual, historic practice, is evidenced by the fact that Ezra 8.31 records that the band of exiles returning under Ezra did not set out upon their journey from their starting point in Babylonia until 1/12, i. e., the day following the close of the eleven day period of celebration of the Babylonian New Year's festival (cf. M 1, 51, note 53). Such being the case, there is no reason to doubt that Num. 7.1-8S likewise is cognizant of this Babylonian festival period and fixes the twelve day period of its celebration in accordance therewith. (The twelve days here, instead of the eleven days of the Babylonian festal period, must be, of course, a concession to the tradition of the twelve tribes, and perhaps also to the sym bolism of the number twelve in Jewish tradition). The import of all this is</page><page sequence="91">[91] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 91 in Ex. 12.18,140 must have gone hand in hand the change in the system of reckoning the day, no longer from morning to morning, as of old, but now from evening to evening.141 And with this in turn as an inevitable result came the redating of the festivals, beginning no longer in the morning, but now in the evening. Thus, for example, the Sukkot festival, which had formerly com menced with the morning of VI1/15, under the older system the beginning of the day, now was made to begin with the evening of the fifteenth, under the new system now the beginning of the day, but actually in point of time a half day earlier than the former beginning of the day. The effect of this change, or at least one effect, was to make the beginning of this festival coincide exactly, instead of only approximately, as had been the case under the old system, with the night of the full moon; and un doubtedly this was an important consideration in this reorgani zation of the calendar. Corresponding to this was, as we have seen, the advancing of the moment of beginning the Mazzot festival by a half a day, to the night of 1/15, instead of the following morning, as had been the practice previously. And this in turn made the beginning of the Mazzot festival coincide not only with the night of the full moon but also with the night of the célébra tion of the Passover, so that in consequence the two festivals, Mazzot and Passover, now became identified and merged com pletely into one festival, instead of, as had apparently been the case up to this very time, the Passover being celebrated independ ently during the night and the Mazzot festival beginning only the next morning, after the Passover celebration was completely finished. obvious; it is that there was a direct Babylonian influence, transmitted, of course, through Jews migrating from Babylonia to Palestine, upon Jewish life in Palestine in general, and upon the evolution of Calendar III in particular. We shall have a more detailed and clearer picture of this process shortly. 140 Lev. 23.32 must, of course, be assigned to this same late P2 stratum. 141 In this connection, however, it should be noted that Ex. 40.38, which, as we have just seen, reckons the new year from 1/1, still mentions the day before the night, as do also Num. 9.15, 16, 21, a passage manifestly secondary to Ex. 40. No particular import, however, need be attached to this, since ap parently the very nature of the incident recounted would necessitate the men tion of the day before the night.</page><page sequence="92">92 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [92] From all this it is clear that the entire transition from Cal endar II to Calendar III was slow and gradual. As we have seen, Pg, with its months of thirty days each, still employed Calendar II.II. But the transfer in Calendar III of the dates of the mostim portant festivals from the moments at which they had been celebrated under Calendar II, moments which still in Calendar II were closely related to the four critical days of the solar year, the equinoctial and solstitial days, to moments significant only in a basically lunar calendar, the days of the new and full moons, and with this the change in the system of reckoning the day from evening to evening, instead of from morning to morning, as under Calendars I and II, establish beyond all question that Calendar III must have been basically a lunar calendar, which reckoned the year, in conformity with a recurrent cycle of twelve phases of the moon, as of either three hundred and fifty-four or three hundred and fifty-five days, and with twelve months of, in the main, alternately thirty and twenty-nine days each. As we have seen, Ezra 6.15 clearly implies that the twelfth month of the year of Calendar III consisted of only twenty-nine days.142 Manifestly then Calendar III was really the creation of a succession of P2 writers and legislators; and equally manifestly Cf. above, note 133. Gen. 8.14 too, as has been said already, interpreted in conjunction with Gen. 7.11, seems to base its reckoning upon a lunar year of three hundred and fifty-four days (i. e., with twelve months of alternately thirty and twenty-nine days each), harmonized, however, with a solar year ten (not eleven, as is frequently stated) days longer, i. e., three hundred and sixty-four days. Obviously this last is not at all a true solar year, but is rather the artificial solar year of Enoch and Jubilees (cf. M 2, 94 ff.). On the other hand, as has been stated previously (above, p. 72), the implication of Gen. 8.3-4, correlated with 7.11, is that the one hundred and fifty days during which the waters of the flood continued to increase, constituted exactly five months, five successive months therefore of thirty days each. That there is thus a seri ous and irreconcilable discrepancy between the statements of Gen. 8.3 and 4a is self-evident, a discrepancy which is, however, easily solved. Manifestly vv. 3-4aab come from Pg, while the insertion of the precise day of the month in v. 4aj3 comes from RP2. The original statement is based upon Calendar II, still employed, as we have seen, by Pg, while the secondary dating in v. 4a/î and also the related datings in 7.11a and 8.14 and also the closely related dating in 8.13a are from RP2 and are reckoned according to its lunar calendar, viz., Calendar III in the late stages of its evolution.</page><page sequence="93">[93] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 93 it was basically a lunar calendar, the months of which differed in duration and character decidedly from those of Calendar II. One practical effect of this was to dislocate the festivals still further from their former coincidence with or specific relation to the critical moments of the solar year, and in consequence to reduce still further their original solar aspects.143 And another and apparently an equally purposed effect was to fix the datings of the festivals with a maximum of precision both within the year itself and also with relation to the phases of the moon. For under this basically lunar calendar the new moon must have fallen regularly upon the first of each month and the full moon with corresponding regularity upon the fifteenth. Obviously it must have been this very calendar against which the author of Jubilees 6.32-37 fulminated so vehemently. But, as has already been intimated, a lunar calendar such as this would be altogether incomplete without a proper and exact system of intercalation, a system of intercalation differing from and presumably more exact in its harmonization of the lunar with the solar year than the system which must have been em ployed under Calendar II. That such a system of intercalation must have been introduced with the adoption of Calendar III is an absolutely inescapable conclusion. But precisely what this system of intercalation may have been is not certain because of total lack of significant evidence. All in all, however, it seems probable that it was the nineteen-year cycle, with the insertion of an extra, thirteenth month, of varyingly twenty-nine or thirty days, seven times within the nineteen-year period, which we find basic to the Jewish system of calendation in the rabbinic and 145 For this end prophets had inveighed, practically in vain, for several centuries, and legislators had likewise sought to achieve it through enactments from the Deuteronomic Reformation down to the comparatively late day with which we are now dealing. And apparently this final reformation, for such it may well be called, did achieve this greatly desired goal. Henceforth, so the evidence seems to indicate, non-Yahwistic, solar elements in the cult practice of Judaism were reduced to a minimum, and such as did survive this reform, such as, for example, the ceremonies of the Simbat Bet Haso'ebah (cf. Mil, 29 f.), were divested of practically all their former, foreign, objectionable char acter and were completely integrated into the official cult of Yahweh.</page><page sequence="94">94 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [94] subsequent periods, which was adopted at this time.144 With this Calendar III became a true luni-solar calendar. But with this new calendar, with the duration of its months and the moments of their beginning altogether different than those of the months of Calendar II, we would expect to find a new method of designating the months, by name instead of by number, as had been the practice under Calendar II. Unques tionably with the gradual evolution and official adoption of Calendar III we must link the introduction of the Babylonian month names. Tradition has recognized that these names were of Babylonian origin, and has attributed their introduction to Babylonian exiles returning to Palestine under Cyrus. But while science has established conclusively that this tradition was cor rect in regarding these names as Babylonian in origin, we have shown145 that in only the vaguest and most general way can the introduction of these Babylonian month names be attributed to returning Babylonian exiles. As we have shown, these Babylonian month names appear in only seventeen biblical passages, and in the vast majority of these the Babylonian name is equated with the corresponding month designated by number,146 a practice like wise employed still in the majority of the ten passages of the Apocrypha in which also the Babylonian month names occur. This evidence shows unmistakably that these Babylonian month names must have been introduced comparatively late and that only slowly and with apparent reluctance on the part of the people did they completely supplant the older system of desig nating the months by number. Quite clearly for a considerable period the months of Calendar III, despite their basic difference in duration and moments of beginning from the corresponding months of Calendar II, must have continued to be designated by number instead of by the later Babylonian names. And clearly too when in both Bible and Apocrypha a Babylonian month 144 That the nineteen-year cycle was probably in use in Babylonia at this time, cf. Ginzel, Handbuch der mathematischen und technischen Chronologie, I, 132 ff. '« M 1, 19-22. !46 For the import of the three unequated datings in Neh. 1.1 2.1; 6.15, cf. below, p. 117.</page><page sequence="95">[95] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 95 name is equated with the designation of the respective month by number, if this equation have any exactness at all, it must be with the month designated by number under the system of Calendar III and not under the earlier system of Calendar II. Otherwise, and more probably, these equations are, at least in the majority of instances, only relative and inexact. From the eventual adoption of these Babylonian month names the inference may be drawn with reasonable certainty that Calendar III was of Babylonian origin, at least in its mechanical aspects, in the names of the months and in its system of reckoning the months and years and of intercalation. Whether the shifting of the dates of the festivals under it to coincide more accurately with the new and full moon days of the months was likewise the result of Babylonian influence or was adopted in accordance with Babylonian precedent is a question which will be considered later. One further change in the system of dating the festivals under Calendar III must be considered. As we have seen, in the course of the evolution of this calendar the two originally independent, though synchronized festivals, Passover and Mazzot, came to be permanently fused. Whereas in the calendar systems of D, H and early P2 Passover was celebrated in the night and the Mazzot festival began only the following morning, under Calen dar III the two festivals were fused completely and in such man ner that the specific Passover rite on the first night marked the beginning of the Mazzot phase of the joint festival as well. Quite naturally, and perhaps even with definite purpose, the Passover character of the joint festival came again under these conditions to dominate the festival celebration,147 and correspondingly the Mazzot aspect of the festival became of secondary import. One significant result developed from this. Originally, in the Mazzot festival proper, not the first day of the festival but the seventh and last day was the day of greatest importance, upon which the ritual celebration of the festival culminated.148 This was followed upon the next day, the day after the close of the festival, "the day after the Sabbath," by the meaningful rite of 1" Precisely as, as we have seen, had been the obvious purpose and achieve ment of the Deuteronomic reformers; cf. above, p. 45. Cf. Ex. 13.7; 15.20-21 ; cf. also M 5, 281 ff.</page><page sequence="96">96 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [96] the solemn cutting and sacrifice of the first sheaf of the new crop. And fifty days after this ceremony the Festival of First-fruits was celebrated. But after the final fusion of the Passover and Mazzot festivals under Calendar III and the renewed emphasis upon the Passover motif quite naturally the first day of the festival came, gradually no doubt, to be regarded as of primary importance, marked, as it was, by the performance of the most distinctive festal rite. And with this the seventh day, the closing day of the festival, naturally lost all, or almost all, of its old significance. Apparently with this the ritual cutting of the first sheaf, an ancient ceremony, as we have seen, apparently suppressed by the Deuteronomic reformers and then revived by the H legislators, again sank into desuetude, at least in official Judaism.1־" With all this, of course, the old "day after the Sabbath" likewise lost its significance entirely, since no distinctive rite was any longer per formed upon it; and in particular it ceased in course of time, at least in official Judaism, to be the point of departure in reckon ing the fifty days until the Shabuot festival. Instead "the day after the Passover"150 eventually took the place formerly held by "the day after the Sabbath." As Josh. 5.11 seems to imply, this day now marked the moment when the new crop might be cut and eaten, apparently, however, no longer with any specific rite, comparable to the cutting of the first sheaf and its attendant ceremonies, to mark in solemn manner the transition from the enjoyment of the old crop to that of the new;131 and it likewise came in time to fix the day from which the reckoning of the fifty days until the Shabuot festival was now figured. Accordingly this festival now and henceforth fell upon the sixth of the third month, Sivan.152 1יי Though perhaps still continued, for a time at least, in Samaritan and Sadducean practice, together with their persistent adherence to the older practice of reckoning the fifty-day period until the Shabuot festival from the day following the close of the Passover-Mazzot festival, "the day after the Sabbath." 1s" Num. 33.3; Josh. 5.11. -5' Cf.

The fact that the later term, "the day after the Passover," occurs in only two P2 passages, Num. 33.3 and Josh. 5.11,153 may per haps be regarded as corroborating this conclusion somewhat. Of even greater significance in this direction is the fact that nowhere does the biblical legislation actually record the provision for the celebration of the Shabuot festival upon the fiftieth day after "the day after the Passover," unquestionably because this final step in the reorganization of the festival calendar had actu ally not yet taken place, or at least had not yet been formally approved and recorded by the religious and legislative authorities of the day, at the time the canon of the Torah was fixed. This conclusion finds strong confirmation in the realization that this final change in the festival calendar, implied in the formal recog nition of "the day after the Passover" and the transfer to it of the institution formerly associated with "the day after the Sab bath," viz., the beginning of the eating of the new crop, was not accepted by either the Samaritans or the Sadducees or by their equinox occurred to the week beginning with the full moon of the first month, and the Festival of First-fruits correspondingly fifty days later, a postpone ment of at least one, and possibly of even two weeks, and had thus been sepa rated from their original connections respectively with the beginning and end of the grain harvest, a connection which, however, had never been forgotten completely, may well have contributed somewhat to this latest advancing, from its old moment on "the day after the Sabbath" to "the day after the Pass over," the date of the beginning of the harvest and the ritual eating of the new grain (Josh. 5.11), and also the date of the Festival of First-fruits by six full days, and thus bringing these two festivals again into closer proximity to the moments of the harvest season with which they had been associated orig inally. 153 Cf. above, p. 96. Very significantly, however, LXX A and B to Josh. 5.11 omit the phrase, מסחרת הפסח, entirely, although all the versions appar ently, including Sam., record it in Num. 33.3. However, whether this expres sion in Num. 33.3 is original or secondary, will be discussed later (below, note 163).</page><page sequence="98">98 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [98] apparent successors, the Karaites and Falashas,154 but that these groups continued to celebrate the Shabuot festival as of old, upon a Sunday, the fiftieth day after the close of the Passover-Mazzot festival, "the day after the Sabbath." With them apparently "the day after the Sabbath" retained much, if not all of its old significance, and "the day after the Passover" was apparently never recognized.155 Only the Pharisees actually accepted the new institution of "the day after the Passover," and with it the new dating of the Shabuot festival on the sixth of Sivan. But, as has been said, under dominant Pharisee influence, this dating became official in subsequent Judaism. More convincing evidence of the comparatively very late date of this ultimate stage in the evolu tion of Calendar III can hardly be required. And finally one other institution of the calendar must like wise come from the period near to the very moment of the official closing of the canon of the Torah, an institution the date of which we can happily fix with reasonable exactness. Num. 9.6-14 re cords the institution of the second Passover, to be observed from 11/14 through 11/20 by those who had been prevented from cele brating the Passover proper at its regular time in the first month, either because they were ritually unclean at the moment, or upon a journey, or for some other comparable and equally valid reason. It should be noticed in the first place that this legislation itself presumes a year which begins upon 1/1, since Num. 9.1 mani festly reckons the first two weeks of the first month, preceding the Passover festival, the real traditional anniversary of the exodus from Egypt, as already a part of the second year. Obvi ously it is speaking here of a calendar year, and one which must therefore have begun upon I/I.156 The nature of the second Passover is perfectly clear and re quires no elucidation. Here it is represented as instituted by Moses in the second year of the desert sojourn. Outside of this M S, 278 ff. 155 Jubilees too seems not to have recognized this change, since it fixes the celebration of Shabuot on 111/15 (III/ll?), likewise upon a Sunday; cf. M 2, 87-93.87-93. 156 So also II Chron. 29.3. These are then additional biblical instances of the New Year's Day upon 1/1.</page><page sequence="99">[99] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 99 Pentateuchal passage it seems to be known only to the Chron icier. Ezra 6.19-22 impliedly shows acquaintance with this insti tution of the second Passover, since it states explicitly that the returned exiles celebrated the Passover at the prescribed time in the first month, because all of them, priests, levites, and laity, together with their brethren who had never gone into exile, but who had dissociated themselves from the defiling practices of the surrounding nations, were ritually pure. The implication seems to be that, had they not been ritually pure, they would have been unable to celebrate the Passover at the prescribed time, but, in accordance with the legislation in Num. 9.6-14, would have had to postpone it to the corresponding period in the second month.157 Of far greater significance, however, is the description of the celebration of the second Passover in II Chron. 30. This tells that it was impossible to celebrate the Passover at its regular time in the first month, because the priests had not yet cleansed themselves of their defilement nor had the people assembled at Jerusalem for this purpose. Accordingly Hezekiah consulted his counsellors, and their decision was to celebrate the festival in the second month. The unmistakable implication of this narra tive is that this institution of the second Passover here was entirely an innovation of Hezekiah, and was in no wise dependent upon established Mosaic legislation recorded in the Torah.158 At any rate not once is reference made here to Mosaic legislation providing for and regulating the second Passover ;159 and unques *" II Chron. 35.3, 6 also seems to imply the necessity for the ritual puri fication of the people at large in preparation for the observance of the Pass over; cf. below, note 159 and J. Jeremias, Die Passahfeier der Samaritaner; Beiheft zur ZAW, 59, p. 109. 158 Notice that the Chronicler regularly, and apparently as a matter of principle, cites the Torah of Moses as the supreme legislative authority when ever the slightest opportunity to do so offers itself (cf. I Chron. 16.40 ; 11 Chron. 23.18; 25.4; 31.3, 4; 35.12). Even in this very narrative he does not fail to do so; cf. vv. 5, 6, 18. *5' Unless perhaps ככתוב in v. 18 be so interpreted; but the entire passage, w. 16-20, is extremely awkward and confused and makes the decided impres sion of bungled editorial revision and expansion. Certainly ככתוב in v. 5 refers to the Passover legislation of P in Ex. 12 rather than to that for the second</page><page sequence="100">100 JULIAN MORGENSTF.RN [100] tionably had the Chronicler been familiar with such legislation, in other words, had he known of the provision in Num. 9.6-14, he would scarcely have failed to cite his authority. No other conclusion is possible than that the Chronicler did not know of any Mosaic legislation providing for the second Passover. For this reason he could ascribe this institution to Hezekiah. But if this be so, then it follows that this legislation for the second Passover in Num. 9.6-14 must be somewhat later than the Chron icier, that, in other words, it must, at the very earliest, be as signed to some time in the first half of the third century B.c. The institution of the second Passover itself was somewhat older than this, for, as we have seen, the Chronicler, at least in II Chron. 30,160 was fully acquainted with its practice, although he knew as yet of no traditionally Mosaic legislation providing for Passover in Num. 9.6-14. In passing note should be taken of another signif icant innovation in this legislation for the second Passover. It is the only bib lical legislation for the Passover which specifically requires that the lay cele brants must be ritually clean. Not even Ex. 12.3-20, which, as we have seen, is itself P2 and comparatively late, makes the slightest reference thereto. The reason for this innovation in Num. 9.6-14 is, however, perfectly plain. Accord ing to Ex. 12.3-20 the entire Passover-Mazzot festival celebration took place at the home, and for this, it is self-evident, ritual purification was hardly essen tial. Num. 9.6-14, on the other hand, clearly implies that the festival was to be celebrated by the people at the central sanctuary, and for this, of course, ritual purification was indispensable. This too is the explicit statement of II Chron. 30, and is likewise implied in Ezra 6.19-22 and II Chron. 35.3, 6, as the reference to the priests and Ievites shows. Manifestly this implies a partial return, though whether conscious or not is not certain, to the older Deuter onomic practice of observing the Passover at the central sanctuary (Deut. 16.1-8), which, as we have seen, H legislation had abrogated. As we have seen also, the P2 legislators of Ex. 12.3-20 had followed their H predecessors in legislating for the celebration of the fused Passover-Mazzot festival at the home. But, as we now see, the very latest P2 legislators, no doubt influenced by much the same consideration as the Deuteronomic reformers, viz., the dominance of the Passover over the Mazzot motif in the fused festival cele bration, changed the scene of the celebration again to the central sanctuary. This was the established practice at the end of the second century b.c., as Jubilees 49. 16-21 shows (cf. J. Jeremias, op. cit., 69). And, as the Mishna evi dences, this continued to be the practice of official Judaism so long as the Temple stood. 160 Though possibly not in Ezra 6.19-22, which has all the earmarks of very late editorial composition.</page><page sequence="101">[101] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 101 it. But until such legislation, viz., that in Num. 9.6-14, was definitely formulated and incorporated into the Torah, the insti tution itself must still have been in a somewhat fluid and unof ficial state. Its official recognition and formal inclusion in the established calendar of Judaism must, as has been said, be as signed at the very earliest to the first half of the third century B.c. This date seems to be decisive.161 From all this evidence, and particularly from that of these last two institutions, the second Passover and "the day after the Passover," with the implications of the latter for the date of the Shabuot festival, we must conclude that the festival cal endar of P2, as recorded within the confines of the Torah itself, did not assume final shape at the very earliest until some time during the third century B.c.162 This conclusion is confirmed by a considerable mass of evidence, such as, for example, by the fact that LXX A and B to Josh. 5.11 do not yet contain the phrase, "the day after the Passover,"163 likewise by the vigorous anta 161 Confirmation of this conclusion may be found in the fact that the scheme of Passover observance set forth in Jubilees 49 makes no provision whatever for the second Passover. This is all the more significant when it is borne in mind that v. 9 there does specify that only the ritually clean may participate in the Passover celebration, that, in other words, Jubilees does draw the dis tinction between ritually clean and unclean with regard to the Passover cele bration. Therefore that it fails to make some provision for the celebration of the Passover later by those who were unclean and therefore disqualified from celebrating it at the prescribed time, must indicate either that it was entirely unacquainted with Mosaic legislation making such provision or that this leg islation in Num. 9.6-14 was so comparatively recent, with relation to the composition of Jubilees, that the authors of the later work did not regard it as sufficiently official and authoritative to at least take cognizance of it in their festival program. 161 161 And in fact did not assume its absolutely final shape, so far as fixing the date of the Shabuot festival definitely upon III/6, fifty days after "the day after the Passover," until after the close of the Pentateuchal canon. 163 It is by no means impossible, and in fact seems most probable, that the phrase, מסחרה הפסח in Num. 33.3, and in fact the whole of vv. 31הראשון+,53-ב at the end of v. 3a, may be a late, harmonistic, editorial insertion into the orig inal text. Various considerations point to this conclusion. In the first place the repetition of הראשון at the end of v. 3a, after the expression בחדש הראשון had been used already'just a few words before, is awkward and suspicious. Vv. 3b~4 introduce an altogether subordinate thought, not essential, and even</page><page sequence="102">102 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [102] gonism of the author of Jubilees to the official adoption of this lunar calendar of P2, to which reference has already been made, quite as if even at the end of the second century B.c. this cal endar was still so comparatively recent that it had not yet been formally adopted by all the religious authorities and sects of Judaism,164 also by the only partial adoption of this calendar by the Samaritans165 and Sadducees, and finally by the fact that still as late as I Maccabees the months were designated by num ber as well as by their Babylonian names. Summing up our conclusions thus far; it is clear that Calendar III as a whole is the result of a gradual evolutionary process somewhat disturbing to the main narrative. Their secondary, editorial char acter is indicated likewise by the loose and awkward syntactical connection of כל בכור, at the end of v. 4a, with the rest of the sentence. Furthermore, v. Sa repeats, practically verbatim, what has been stated already in v. 3aa; this repetition is, of course, necessitated by the insertion of the secondary material in vv. 3b~5a. Finally, v. Sb is the immediate continuation of v. 3a (- הראשון). These considerations seem sufficient to establish the secondary character of vv. 3b-5a, and with these, of course, of the phrase ממחרת הפסח in v. 3b. 164 It is a matter of more than passing significance that of all the calendar changes which the gradual evolution of Calendar III called forth, only that which would have fixed the New Year's Day upon 1/1 was not approved and adopted by official Judaism. But the fact that Enoch and Jubilees, and ap parently I and II Maccabees also, represent the New Year's Day as falling upon 1/1, would seem to indicate that in certain circles of Judaism even this innovation did find some acceptance, even though eventually rejected by the religious authorities, the Pharisees no doubt, in favor of the older practice of Calendar III of the New Year's Day upon VII/1. It is indeed surprising that Jubilees should have adopted this particular innovation of Calendar III (cf. Jubilees 7.2) in view of its basic rejection of and open antagonism to the prin ciple underlying Calendar III, viz., that of the lunar reckoning of the months and year and the resultant dating of the festivals. 165 In this connection it is interesting and significant to note that II Chron. 30.1, 10 (cf. v. 18, the secondary character of which within this chapter we have already noted) states definitely that the Galileans accepted it with un questioning devotion and piety. In all likelihood this is the oldest specific: record of the divergent attitudes of the Samaritans and the Galileans toward the Temple at Jerusalem and the authority of the religious leaders there, which play such a conspicuous role in the later historical records and traditions of both Judaism and Christianity. That these divergent attitudes can thus be traced back to approximately 300 b.c. is of more than passing historical significance.</page><page sequence="103">[103] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 103 extending over a period of approximately one hundred and fifty years, from about 400 B.c. to about 250 B.c., or even some what later than this. Speaking generally the evolution of Calen dar III seems to have sprung out of the urge to develop and adopt officially a perfect luni-solar calendar. It began accordingly with the transfer of the moments of celebrating the Sukkot and combined Passover-Mazzot festivals from their original dates to the full moon days of the seventh and first months respectively, and of the New Year's Day from VII/10 to VII/1, the new moon day of the seventh month. It was completed only with the adop tion of the new system of reckoning the day, from evening to evening, with the consequent redating of the festivals, with each festival now beginning in the evening, with a new system of months of alternately thirty and twenty-nine days each, with new, Babylonian month names applied to them, and with a new system of intercalation. The evolution of Calendar III falls into two distinct periods, an early and a late period, and with each of these two periods capable of being subdivided into two lesser periods. Between the two periods the end of the Persian and the beginning of the Greek epoch seem to be the dividing line. To Period la may be assigned the first steps in the evolution of Calendar III, already noted, viz., the transfer of the New Year's Day from VII/10 to VII/1, of Sukkot from VII/3-9 to VII/15—21, of the Passover to the night of 1/14 and of the Mazzot festival to 1/15-21. To Period lb must be assigned the evolution of the eighth day of the Suk kot celebration, Shemini Atseret, on VI1/22 and of Yom Kippur on VII/10. To Period I la belong those processes which practically com pleted the evolution of Calendar III as a perfect, or approxi mately perfect luni-solar calendar, viz., the change in the system of reckoning the day, the redating of the festivals to begin at sunset, and with this the final and complete fusion of the Pass over and Mazzot festivals, as recorded in Ex. 12.18,166 the new 166 In this connection Ezek. 45.21-25 is of extreme interest and significance for this study. These verses give the program for the celebration of the Mazzot and Sukkot festivals which the prophet is represented as having formulated. The vast majority of biblical scholars accept more or less unquestioningly the Ezekelian</page><page sequence="104">104 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [104] system of months of alternately thirty and twenty-nine days each and the new system of intercalation. To Period lib, which authorship of these verses and this program (cf. in particular, Herrmann, Ezechiclstudien,Ezechiclstudien, 60; and against this view, Hôlscher, Hesekiel: der Dichter und das Buch,Buch, 201 f.). However, v. 21 in particular presents a number of problems, all of which have been apparently solved by scholars in a seemingly simple and ready to-hand manner, which, however, misses the real import of the verse completely and serves only to make confusion worse confounded. Of these proposed so lutions of the various problems which the verse presents only one can be regarded as absolutely certain and correct, viz., the reading, with three manuscripts (cf. Bewer's critical apparatus in Kittel's Biblia Hebraica [ed. Kahle]) and with all the versions, of שבעת for קובעות of MT. Jahn (Das Buch Ezechiel, 335) has suggested that the reading of MT represents an attempt to smuggle into the text a reference to the Shabuot festival, in order to complete, in the proph et's festival program, the cycle of the three pilgrimage festivals. But if so, then it must be admitted that, on the one hand, the change was made comparatively late, since all the versions, even the Vulgate, read שבעת here, and that, on the other hand, such an attempt to represent the prophet as referring to theShab uot festival in addition to the Passover and the Sukkot festival would have been exceedingly clumsy; for had a reference to or legislation for the Shabuot festival been intended here by the original author, it would certainly have been in a place and manner quite different from this. Furthermore, it is self-evident that the word חב, at the beginning of v. 21b is syntactically difficult, if not impossible. This difficulty is evident from the fact that LXX divides the verse differently than does MT and assigns חג to the first half of the verse. Pesh. inserts a connective waw before חב, but, it is clear, this helps the reading not at all and serves only to emphasize all the more the textual difficulty here. Again the vast majority of modern biblical scholars attempt to solve the problem by cutting the Gordian knot and trans posing חג to precede הפסח. Finally, practically all these scholars are greatly troubled by the fact that the verse dates the festival as beginning on 1/14 and continuing for seven days. Practically all (so Cornill, Bertholet, Kraetzsch mar, Jahn, Rothstein [in Kittel's Biblia Hebraica, II, though with more reser vation in Kautzsch, Die heilige Schrift des A. T.,A II] and Hôlscher, all fol lowing a suggestion first offered by Smend) change mechanically and absolutely apodictically בארבעה of MT to בחמשה and make the festival begin upon 1/15. Neither of these emendations has the slightest internal evidence to support it, and both miss the point completely. The solution of these two problems, so far as problems do exist here, must be sought in an entirely different direction. The first fact of significance here is that the festival is designated only as הפסח. The name חג הסצות does not occur even once. And yet that the Mazzot festival is implied also in the use of the term הפסח is evidenced by the fact that this Passover festival is made to endure, not for a single night, but for</page><page sequence="105">[105] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 105 apparently belongs well within the third century B.c. and ante dates by very little the closing of the Pentateuchal canon, belong the full period of seven days and likewise by the specific command that during these seven days mazzot should be eaten. These considerations establish be yond all question the correctness of the reading בארבעה of MT and of all the versions. It needs but a moment's thought to realize that the dating of the festival here, as well as the designation of it by the name הפסח alone, together with the unmistakable implication that the mazzot are to be eaten from the very first moment of the festival accord perfectly with the dating, name and manner of celebration of this festival prescribed in P legislation in general and in Ex. 12.18 in particular. The realization of this fact suffices to establish be yond the slightest possibility of doubt the correctness of the dating here. And not that alone, but the fact that both pieces of legislation, Ex. 12.18 and Ezek. 45.21, begin in precisely the same way and throughout have marked affinities of expression establishes clearly that a close relationship exists between them. But it is equally clear that this verse, and in fact this entire passage, has perhaps even closer affinities with the parallel legislation in Num. 28.16-17. Even there one slight textual difficulty exists, for it is apparent that in v. 17 חג alone, as it stands at present, is insufficient, or is at least ambiguous. As it stands at present we can translate חג only in its original meaning, "a sacred dance." But certainly this was not the meaning intended; for, on the one hand, we know that the sacred dance connected with this festival was performed, not upon the first day, but upon the last day of the festival (cf. Ex. 13.6; M 5, 281-283; also above, note 100), and, on the other hand, it is clear from a com parison with Lev. 23.6 that the word המצות has fallen out, or, perhaps better, has been purposely omitted here, after חג, by late P editors, who, in the spirit of the legislation of Ex. 12.18, desired to use only the name הפסח for the now completely fused Passover-Mazzot festival. As we have seen, Num. 28.16-17 provided for the celebration of the Passover on the night of I 14 and for the Mazzot festival from the morning of 1/15 through 1/21. It is now clear that Ezek. 45.21 is related to Num. 28.16-17 very closely and is in all probability dependent upon it more or less directly. From this it follows that the syntactically impossible חג in Ezek. 45.21 is the result of direct patterning after the almost equally difficult, if not impossible חג in Num. 28.17. Unquestionably this syntactically impossible wording here is original and cor rect, as the versions testify. And the solution of the problem is not at all to emend the text, as the various biblical scholars propose, but to retain the awkward and practically meaningless text precisely as it is and to realize that this awkwardness and syntactical confusion are due to the clumsy efforts of very late Priestly writers or editors to harmonize the legislation of Num. 28.16-17, with its provision for the celebration of the Passover upon the night of 1/14 and the Mazzot festival from the morning of 1/15 to the morning of 1/22, with that of Ex. 12.18, with its complete fusion of these two festivals</page><page sequence="106">106 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [106] the final, and what seem to be, in the main, more or less incidental stages in the evolution of Calendar III, the attempted transfer of the New Year's Day from VII/1 to 1/1, the introduction of under the single name חג הפסח and the beginning of the resultant composite festival, marked by the offering of the Paschal sacrifice and also by the com•• mencement of the period of eating mazzot, upon the night of 1/14. It is obvious that to the author of Ezek. 45.21 this Passover-Mazzot festival began at night fall, that in other words, precisely as did the authors of Ex. 12.18, he too reck■ oned the day from evening to evening. But this in turn establishes beyond all question that Ezek. 45.21, and with it the entire passage, vv. 21-25, must be later than both Num. 28.16 ff. and Ex. 12.18, and that it can therefore under no condition be the work of the prophet himself, nor of his age, but must be the work of a much later Priestly writer living not earlier than the middle of the third century B.C. (So far as this one passage is concerned, this dating would agree with the dating of the entire book by Torrey [Pseudo-Ezekiel and the the Original Prophecy}.) One further consideration of interest and importance bears upon the festi val calendar recorded in Ezek. 45.18-25. We have just shown that the legisla tion for the Passover in v. 21 depends directly upon Ex. 12.18, that both pre sume a day beginning in the evening and not in the morning, and that accord ingly neither passage can be older than the middle of the third century B.C., at approximately which time the new system of reckoning the day must have been introduced. We have seen too that Yom Kippur had been instituted before this time, and that Lev. 23.32b represents an attempt to redate this festival in terms of the new system of reckoning the day (above, p. 25). It follows accordingly that the institution of Yom Kippur must be older than Ezek. 45.21. But, as Lev. 16.33 states explicitly, one of the primary purposes of the Yom Kippur ceremonial was the purification of the sanctuary and its equipment from all uncleanness which might have befallen them during the course of the year. That legislation manifestly contemplates only one day of purification of the sanctuary in the course of the year. This was thenceforth the established practice in Judaism throughout the post-Biblical period so long as the Temple stood. Accordingly it follows that, regardless of what the original reading may have been, particulary in the obviously extremely con fused and corrupt v. 20, the provision in vv. 18-20 for two annual days of purification of the sanctuary on 1/1 and VII/1 respectively (for the latter date, cf. LXX), i. e., exactly six months apart, must be earlier than the legislation for the one annual purification of the sanctuary upon Yom Kippur, recorded in Lev. 16.33. But granting this, it follows necessarily that the legislation for the Passover and Sukkot festivals in Ezek. 45.21 ff. can not be a literary and legislative unit with the legislation in vv. 18-20, but must be decidedly later. The legislation for the semi-annual purification of the sanctuary in vv. 18-20 must be set down as earlier than the middle of the fourth century b.c., the approx imate date of the institution of Yom Kippur, and perhaps even quite a bit</page><page sequence="107">[107] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 107 the institution of the second Passover, the formal substitution of the concept of "the day after the Passover" for "the day after the Sabbath", with the resultant and final redating of the Sha buot festival to fall upon the sixth of Sivan, and the introduction of the Babylonian month names. These two last processes seem to have evolved at a date so late that no specific record of them occurs in the Pentateuch itself, although the Babylonian month names are used sparingly in late prophetic and hagiographie writings. This implies that these two last processes must have evolved after the close of the Pentateuchal canon. Apparently Calendar III was based upon a Babylonian model ; at least this would seem to be the implication of the adop tion of the Babylonian month names to designate the new months of alternately thirty and twenty-nine days. This would seem also to be the implication of the very manifest, though ultimately unsuccessful, effort to fix the date of the New Year's Day upon I/l,167 instead of upon VII/1. Apparently too the final stages of the evolution of Calendar III were influenced to a by no means inconsiderable extent by considerations of reform of the tradi tional festival ritual animated more or less by internal sectarian differences. Of this last the oft-cited vigorous protest of the earlier. On the other hand, as we have seen, vv. 21 ff. can not be earlier than the middle of the third century b.c. Furthermore, it seems quite probable that v. 22, in which the expiatory and purificatory idea seems paramount, should be linked with w. 18-20 rather than with v. 21 immediately preceding. V. 23 would follow perfectly and with much closer continuity directly upon v. 21 than it does at present with v. 22 intervening between them. And finally, the thought suggests itself that this late legislation for the Pass over and Sukkot festivals, respectively upon 1/15 and VII/15, was introduced here in order to give the implication that the two biennial days of purification of the sanctuary, on 1/1 and VII/1 respectively, and the attendant expiatory rites were merely in preparation for the celebration of the two great semi annual festivals, each exactly two weeks after the performance of the cere monies of purification. Manifestly Ezek. 45,18-25 is anything but a literary and legislative unit, and the festival calendar which it records represents a growth over a period of at least a century and a half. Whether it was ever, either wholly or in part, actually in effect is, of course, problematic. 167 Cf. also above, note 139.</page><page sequence="108">108 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [108] author of Jubilees 6.32-38 against Calendar III in the latest stages of its evolution offers convincing evidence.168 It is self-evident that changes in a calendar system so exten sive and significant as that from Calendar II to Calendar III, and likewise the internal changes and modifications within Cal endar III itself in the course of its evolution could not have come about as the result of accident or of a mere momentary concatena tion of circumstances. There must have been causes and purposes basic thereto. And our next task in this investigation is to deter mine these causes and purposes and interpret them in relation to their times, so far as this may be possible. V The Historical Background of Calendar III In the determination of the historical causes and purposes which brought about the substitution of Calendar III for Calendar II and shaped its gradual evolution, a consideration of the calendar data present in the Elephantine papyri will furnish information of deep significance. Most of these documents are accurately dated. The earliest comes from 495 B.C.,16' still within the reign of Darius I. The vast majority of the dated or datable docu ments come from within the century following immediately upon this date. Speaking generally therefore, practically all these docu ments of significance for our study come from the fifth century b.c., and cover that entire century. But just this is, as we have seen, the period of the early stages of the evolution of Calendar III. The first fact to attract attention is the use of the Babylonian month names in these documents with a frequency greater than in the entire biblical and apocryphal literature. All in all these Babylonian month names seem to occur eighteen times in the 168 Cf. also the very compelling argument of J. Jeremias (op. cit., 69) that Jubilees 49.16-21, legislating for the celebration of the Passover at the central sanctuary, and under no condition in the homes or various cities, was really propaganda directed against the Samaritan practice, based primarily upon Ex. 12.3-30. 16' Cf. Cowley, Aramaic Papyri of the Fifth Century B.C., 1 ff.</page><page sequence="109">[109] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 109 papyri.170 Correspondingly the Egyptian month names seem to occur twenty-six times. Apparently not in a single instance are the months designated in the papyri by number, as was the practice in Palestine under Calendar II, and as seems to have continued to be the practice in the early stages of the evolution of Calendar III, as we have seen. Moreover, as we have also seen, Calendar II continued to be employed even by Pg, and must accordingly, whatever be the actual date which we may assign to Pg, have been in general use in Palestine at least during the greater part of the fifth century B.c. Manifestly therefore the calendar employed by the Jews of Elephantine was not at all identical with Calendar II, nor was their calendar influenced in any way by Palestinian models. The introduction of the Baby Ionian month names into the Elephantine practice could not have been mediated by Palestine, but must have sprung from some other source. This conclusion is confirmed absolutely by the fact that these Babylonian month names appear in the papyri quite a bit earlier than in the biblical writings. However, it is certain that the use of Babylonian month names by the Jewish colony at Elephantine was not native with them, but an importation. As the documents clearly affirm,171 this Jewish colony was established in Elephantine quite some time before the rise of the Persian empire. In fact its beginnings, if they do not actually antedate, seem at least to come very close to the time of the Deuteronomic Reformation.172 Clearly there fore these Jewish colonists could not under any condition have brought these Babylonian month names with them into Egypt. Presumably in the early period of their sojourn they employed the Egyptian month names exclusively, just as, as the papyri show conclusively, they identified themselves to quite a consider able extent with their Egyptian neighbors and assimilated much 170 As edited by Cowley {op. cit.). It is necessary to say "seem," since several of these eighteen instances are the result of editorial reconstruction of fragmentary texts; and no matter how responsible and authoritative such editing may be, it can scarcely be regarded as absolutely certain in every case. 171 Cowley, op. cit., #30 (=Sachau, Aramaische Papyrus und Ostraka aus Elephantine,Elephantine, #1), 13 f. 'נל Cowley, op. cit., Introduction, XVI.</page><page sequence="110">110 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [110] of the native Egyptian culture. This conclusion is borne out fully by the papyri themselves. Not only are Egyptian month names cited half again as frequently as the Babylonian names, but other considerations likewise show that the use of the Egyptian month names was normal in the Jewish colony, while that of the Baby Ionian names was secondary and more or less artificial. The two oldest documents, dating from 495 and 484 b.c. respectively, employ only the Egyptian names. Moreover, three other papyri, ##7, 22 and 30, all coming from before 400 b.c., likewise em ploy only the Egyptian month names. The first mention of a Babylonian month name occurs in papyrus #5173 dated 471 b.c., i. e., near the end of the reign of Xerxes. From that date on, how ever, and continuing steadily through the reigns of Artaxerxes I and Darius II, and in fact down to the rebellion of Amyrtaeus in 404 B.c., and even for a very brief period thereafter, Baby Ionian month names are used with almost unfailing regularity, but, with one single but very significant exception, are in every case equated with the corresponding Egyptian month name.1'4 Moreover, the manner of this equation is significant. Almost invariably the date is first given according to the Babylonian system, qualified by the explanatory statement, "that is," and then the date according to the Egyptian calendar system. Clearly the Babylonian system is here the new and less generally em ployed system, and is therefore apparently felt to lack somewhat in adequacy. As we have already noted, just this is the practice 1'3 The enumeration will henceforth be that of Cowley (op. cit.), unless specific considerations dictate a different procedure. 1'4 Only papyri # 7 (461 b.c.), # 22 (419 b.c.) and § 29 (circa 409 b.c.), coming from the pre-Amyrtaeus period, give the Egyptian month-name alone, without the respective Babylonian equivalent. On the other hand, according to Cowley's reconstruction, papyrus #61 (=Sachau, plate 55, col. 2; Ungnad AramàischeAramàische Papyrus aus Elephantine, # 67, 2) contains the month-name, Adar, without any Egyptian equivalent. However, this particular text is none too legible at the best. The reconstructions of both Sachau and Ungnad differ radically from that of Cowley, and in place of the name, Adar, Ungnad at least seems to read the Egyptian month-name, Epiphi. The fact too that this papyrus is undatable adds somewhat to the uncertainty of this matter. All in all Cowley's reconstruction must be regarded as exceedingly doubtful ; there fore no conclusions may be drawn from it.</page><page sequence="111">[Ill] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 111 also in the vast majority of the biblical and apocryphal passages in which the Babylonian month names are cited. As has been said, there is in the papyri one single and very significant exception to this practice. It occurs in the oft-cited papyrus #30, wherein the Jews of Elephantine in 408 B.c. address Arsames, the Persian governor of Egypt, inform him of the destruction of their temple by the Egyptian rebels and im plore his permission and assistance to rebuild this structure. Here, in 11. 4, 19 and 30 the Babylonian month names Tammuz and Marheshwan occur without their corresponding Egyptian equivalents. The reason for this is self-evident. As both his name and office indicate, Arsames was not an Egyptian nor in all likelihood in any way influenced by Egyptian culture. He was a very high Persian official, accustomed therefore to the use of Babylonian month names, at least in formal, official communica tions. In this document, addressed directly to him, to have equated the Babylonian month names with the corresponding Egyptian names would have been useless and meaningless and not impos sibly even a bit irritating. Moreover, the uprising of the Egyp tians in 411 b.c., which brought about the destruction of the temple of Yahu at Yeb and which culminated in the rebellion of Amyrtaeus seven years later, was unquestionably induenced quite as much by considerations of a revival of Egyptian national culture as of restored political independence. Only so can we account for the destruction of the Yahu temple and the manifest hatred of the Jewish colonists on the part of the native Egyptians. Not improbably therefore these Jewish colonists, victims of this nationalistic, cultural, Egyptian reaction against them, may have experienced not a little satisfaction in refraining in this document from the use of the Egyptian month names, and thus in a small and indirect manner affirming to the powerful Persian governor their loyalty to him and his government in this disturbed Egyp tian political situation and their adherence to Babylonian cultural influences and policies. But these very considerations, so readily apparent, suggest likewise still further, that the use of the Baby Ionian month names by these Jewish colonists in Egypt was not native, was secondary and somewhat artificial, an importation superimposed, as it were, upon them.</page><page sequence="112">112 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [112] And, as has been said, this importation could not have been from Palestine. It could have come from only one source, directly from headquarters, from Babylonia or Persia itself. And certainly it was not brought to Egypt by Jewish exiles returning from Babylonia. This conclusion finds complete confirmation in the oft-cited Passover papyrus,175 the importance of which can not be over emphasized. Unfortunately this papyrus is quite fragmentary. Of the apparently eleven lines of which it consisted, only 1. 3 is preserved in its entirety. L. 2 is practically complete, as is like wise the very last line, only a few signs in each being missing. Of the remaining lines only the middle half of each is preserved, the beginning and end of each, equivalent apparently to about half of the text, having been lost. None the less the import of the document is so patent that a reconstruction of the entire docu ment, recorded in Cowley's edition of the text, has been accepted unreservedly, not only by Cowley himself, but also by such rep resentative scholars as Ed. Meyer176 and Olmstead.177 The first fact of significance is that the extant portions of this document establish beyond all possibility of doubt that the com mand to celebrate the festival in the prescribed manner emanates, formally at least, from the king himself. The king in question is Darius II. The date of the document is 419 B.c. The command is transmitted in what was no doubt the customary manner, through Arsames, as we have seen, the governor of Egypt, under whose immediate jurisdiction therefore the Jews of Elephantine stood. The message is actually brought by a certain Hananiah, who calls the Jews of Elephantine his brothers. This fact, as well as his orthodox Jewish name, stamp this royal messenger as him self a Jew. Moreover, papyrus #38, 7 speaks of "the time when Hananiah was in Egypt." Clearly he remained for some time, probably long enough to deliver his message and no doubt carry out its program, and also discharge whatever other tasks had 15י Cowley, § 21 (Sachau, plate 6; Ungnad § 6); cf.

History of Palestine and Syria, 604 f.</page><page sequence="113">[113][113] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 113 been entrusted to him, and only then departed, presumably for his native country. In all likelihood, therefore, he was a Baby Ionian Jew.178 Moreover, as Cowley has emphasized,179 at the utmost merely the basic edict, recorded in the missing first half of 1. 4, com manding the Jews of Elephantine to observe the festival, eman ated from the king. The details of the celebration of the festival, recorded in the remainder of the document, must have repre sented the expansion of the original royal decree, of course with the king's tacit permission, by those who were most directly inter ested in the festival observance. Certainly Darius himself could not have cared one whit whether or how a small, insignificant colony of Jews in a far distant corner of his vast empire cele brated the Passover. Manifestly influence must have been brought to bear upon him to induce him to promulgate this edict. This influence could have been exerted only by the Jews of Persia. Because of an exaggerated, smug, self-satisfied piety180 18י And undoubtedly a person of considerable importance, since at quite some time after his departure they still referred to "the time when Hananiah was in Egypt" (#38, 1. 7). In fact his official mission to and position among the Jews of Elephantine, as the bearer and agent of a royal edict, seem in some repects to have paralleled closely those of Ezra and Nehemiah, and especially the former, among the Jews in Palestine, even though it is true that apparently he did not fill at the same time a high Persian official position, as did Nehemiah. r" Op. cit., Introduction, XXV. 180 Fostered, on the one hand, by the presence and leadership among them of practically the entire group of Sadokite priests from the Temple at Jeru salem, and, on the other hand, having its roots in the doctrine first promul gated by Jeremiah (24.1-10) and then reaffirmed more formally and pragmati cally by Ezekiel (11.14-21) (in v. 15, with Bertholet and Torrey [op. cit., 40, note 11], read אח;ה for one אחיך), himself a Sadokite, even before the down fall of the nation in 586 b.c., that the captivity was to be an experience of discipline through suffering, of regeneration and of eventual restoration, with the corollary that the Jews of Babylonia, those who had actually gone into exile, had been the ones who experienced this discipline and regeneration, while the Jews of Palestine, who had not gone into exile, had correspondingly missed this discipline and had therefore remained steeped in their old, sinful, idola trous ways, and were in consequence still unregenerate and inferior in Yah weh's eyes and less worthy of His pardoning grace than their Babylonian brethren; cf. further, below, note 194.</page><page sequence="114">114 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [114] they must have regarded their own Jewish life and practice, as it had evolved in Babylonia during the century and a half or somewhat more of their exile, as eminently proper, as setting the absolute standard for right and pious Jewish life and religious observance, and, what is not at all surprising, they must have been imbued with a strong fanatic urge to impose this Jewish life and practice of theirs upon all Jewish communities through out the world, so far as their influence could be made to reach. In this particular case their influence with the king, whatever its underlying, motivating considerations may have been, sufficed for the promulgation of this decree, imposing their Babylonian manner of observing the Passover festival upon their distant, and no doubt in their eyes benighted, Egyptian brethren. Now it is most significant that the manner of celebration of the festival set forth in this document, particularly in the recon structed text presented by Cowley, agrees in all essential details with the manner of celebrating the combined Passover-Mazzot: festival recorded in Lev. 23.5-7. No doubt this complete agree ment is due in part to the fact that this reconstruction has obvi ously been based upon this very biblical passage. But recognizing this, when we confine our attention merely to those absolutely authentic portions of the document, those which have been pre served beyond all possibility of misreading, the following facts stand out. L. 4, with but a slight and absolutely certain emenda tion, makes mention of the fourteenth of the month, with the unmistakable implication that this is,the moment of the cele bration of the Passover.181 Then 1. 8 speaks of the festival célébra 181 Note also the mention of the Passover (פסחא) upon the ostrakon repro duced in PSBA, 1915, p. 222 and Ungnad, #77A, 1. 5 (־Sachau, #64, 2). That the Passover was mentioned here in the missing portion of 1. 4 is to be inferred with certainty from the specific mention of the fourteenth of the month ; for in all biblical legislation the fourteenth is associated only with the Passover, and never directly with the Mazzot festival, except in Ex. 12.18, and even there this association is secondary. The fifteenth is always the day marking the beginning of the Mazzot festival proper, precisely as is stated here. This papyrus must then have provided for the celebration of the Pass over on the night of the fourteenth as well as for the celebration of the Mazzot festival upon the fifteenth-twenty-first. This consideration answers Arnold's contention, apparently supported by Montgomery (JQR, N. S., 24 [1933],</page><page sequence="115">[115] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 115 tion extending from the evening of a certain day of the month,182 the exact enumeration of which came in a portion of the tine which is missing, until the twenty-first of the month. But 1. 5 speaks of the period from the fifteenth to the twenty-first of the month, and the lines immediately following record the command that during this period the people are not to drink something, the exact specification of which occurred in a lost portion of 1. 7, but which has bçen reconstructed, unquestionably correctly, as שכר, i. e., fermented liquor, and also are not to do something, unquestionably eat, as the reconstruction suggests, anything which is leavened. Manifestly these lines provide for the observ ance of the restrictions of the Mazzot festival. Unquestionably then this document commanded the celebration of the Passover on the fourteenth and of the Mazzot festival from the fifteenth through the twenty-first of Nisan. Moreover, the specific mention in 1. 8 of the entire duration of the festival from the evening of a certain day, i. e., the fourteenth, as we have just seen, until the twenty-first, corroborates this conclusion. But just this formulation of the festival and its dating, with a clear-cut dis tinction still drawn between the Passover on the night of the fourteenth of the month and the seven-day Mazzot festival, beginning on the morning of the fifteenth and continuing through 153, that actually this papyrus dealt only with the Mazzot, and not also with the Passover aspect of the joint festival, and should therefore be termed the Mazzot, rather than the Passover papyrus (cf. above, note 175). It2 Which must, however, have been the fourteenth, and not the fifteenth, as the reconstruction mistakenly has it. For had the day been reckoned here as beginning at evening, which alone would permit the insertion of the fifteenth into the missing portion of 1. 8, there would have been no occasion whatever for mentioning the fourteenth in 1. 4. The clear implication is that the festival is composite, that the entire festival period extends from the fourteenth, at evening, when the Passover was celebrated, to and through the twenty-first, the close of the seven-day period of the Mazzot festival. At first glance it might be argued that the text prescribes that the festival should extend only to to the twenty-first, that it must therefore have begun on the fourteenth, and that this provision therefore agrees, not with Lev. 23.5-7, but with Ex. 12.18. But the precise statement in 1. 5 that a certain specific portion of the festival, viz., the period of the Mazzot celebration, extended from the fifteenth to (and therefore through) the twenty-first precludes all possibility of such an inter pretation and establishes conclusively that the legislation here parallels Lev. 23.5-7, and not Ex 12.18.</page><page sequence="116">116 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [116] the twenty-first of the month,185 is what is recorded in Lev. 23.5-7. And, as we have seen, Lev. 23.5-7 and Num. 28.16 ff. record the early P2 prescriptions for the celebration of the joint, but not yet completely fused, Passover-Mazzot festival. Furthermore, as Cowley has suggested,184 the implication of this decree is that the festival had never before been celebrated1 at least in this manner, and apparently especially upon this date, by the Jews of Elephantine. This is an innovation for them, totally unknown to them before 419 b.c. And, as has been said, the impulse to this manner of celebration came, not from Pales tine, but from Persia. Whether the festival was already cele brated in this manner in Palestine, in other words, whether the Passover-Mazzot legislation in Lev. 23.5-8 and Num. 28.16 ff. is older or younger than 419 B.c. is a question which we must still consider. Certainly, however, 419 b.c. is a fixed date of departure for this particular investigation.185 183 "Until the twenty-first day" of 11. 5 and 8 of the papyrus are unques tionably inclusive. 184 Introduction, XXV, and also p. 61. 185 Note should also be taken of the fact to which attention has been called by Gutesmann ("Sur le calendrier en usage chez les Israélites au V siècle avant notre ère," REJ, 53 [1907], 194-200) that the year which was reckoned by the Babylonian month-names was not at all identical with the solar year of the Egyptian system of calendation, that instead it must have been a luni solar year, and must therefore have employed some system of intercalation. So much is certain. But I question strongly the correctness of Gutesmann's conclusion that this system of intercalation must have been based upon a twenty-five year cycle, similar to, if not actually identical with the Egyptian Apis-period. It does not appear to me, unversed though I am in the intricate mathematics of astronomy and calendation, that the data which the papyri offer suffice to determine this matter with even approximate certainty. But it is difficult, if not actually impossible, to imagine that an unmistakably purely Babylonian system of calendation should have employed as the basis for its system of intercalation a unit period of time peculiarly Egyptian. In all likeli hood the nineteen-year cycle, the Babylonian origin of which, and also its use in the Persian Empire at just this time seem fairly well established, was basic to the Babylonian system of chronology recorded in the papyri (cf. A. Jeremias, Handbuch des altorientalischen Geisteskultur, 158). On the other hand, Gutesmann's conclusion (p. 195) that the year of the Elephantine cal endar was reckoned from the spring, i. e., from the 1st of Nisan, seems reason ably certain. But this would, of course, serve to identify the Elephantine with the Babylonian calendar more completely; cf. M 2, 78 f.</page><page sequence="117">til7] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 117 Now when we turn to the biblical passages in which the Baby Ionian month names are recorded we find that in the large ma jority of cases they are equated with the months designated by number, precisely as in the papyri the Babylonian month names are regularly equated with the Egyptian month names. More over, this equation in the Bible of the Babylonian month names with the corresponding designation of the months by number is such as to establish beyond all question that the latter system of designating the months is the older and the natural and basic system, and that the designation of the months by the Baby Ionian names is the younger system, just being introduced and as yet none too generally accepted. Moreover, of all these biblical passages in only eight do the Babylonian month names occur without any equation with the months designated by number. Of these eight passages, four occur in Esth. 9.15, 17, 19, 21; but already in this chapter, in v. 1, the month of Adar, to which all these verses refer, has already been equated with the twelfth month. And in every other passage in Esth. in which Babylonian month names are mentioned, viz., 2.16; 3.7, 13; 8.9, they are always equated with the corresponding month, designated by number. The latter seems therefore to be the basic practice in Esth. Moreover, the consensus of opinion of modern scholars is that Esth. is one of the latest, if not the very latest of the books of the Bible and comes in all likelihood from the last half of the second century B.C. Likewise the relatively late date of Ezra 6.15, in which the month name Adar occurs ivithout being equa ted with a numerical designation of the month, has already been established.186 Accordingly of the eight passages in question, only three remain for consideration. All three are in Neh., viz., 1. 1; 2.1 and 6.15; and all three passages are generally recognized as authentic extracts from Nehemiah's memoirs. At first glance this would seem to indicate that the Babylonian month names were already in unrestricted use in Palestine at the time of Nehemiah, i. e., in the second half of the fifth century B.c. Actually, however, just the opposite conclusion must be drawn. It must never be 186 Above, note 133.</page><page sequence="118">118 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [118] forgotten that Nehemiah was in heart and soul a Babylonian Jew, a fanatic in spirit, and as such imbued no doubt with a considerable impatience with and even contempt for the native Jews of Palestine and their customs and institutions. Even in Palestine he would naturally have persisted, at least in his per sonal records, in employing his own native Babylonian system of calendation throughout. This will account for the citation in his memoirs of these three dates by the Babylonian month names alone, without equating them with the corresponding month designations by number. But granting this, then it becomes all the more evident that still in Nehemiah's time the Babylonian month names were used in Palestine only with the utmost infre quency, even if at all, except by an occasional fanatic Babylonian immigrant. Moreover, it is clear from the fact already noted, viz., that not until a comparatively very late date, perhaps only in the second century B.c., did the Babylonian month names begin to be used with sufficient generality that it was felt that the prac tice of equating them with the corresponding numerical désigna tion of the month might be dispensed with, and from the addi tional fact that this latter practice persisted even into I Macc., that the Babylonian month names were introduced into Pales tinian usage at a date quite a bit later than they were introduced into that of the Jews of Elephantine, and that their introduction into Palestinian usage apparently encountered strong and effec tive opposition before it finally came to prevail completely. But if, under the influence of the Babylonian Jews, the use -of the Babylonian month names was introduced into Palestine later than into Egypt, it may be assumed with reasonable safety that the reform which fixed the date of the composite Passover Mazzot festival from the night of 1/14 through 1/21, as recorded in Lev. 23.5-7, in place of during the week in which the spring equinox fell, as it had been practiced under the provisions of the Holiness Code, was likewise introduced into Palestinian practice somewhat later than into Egypt, i. e., somewhat later than 419 B.c., presumably therefore not before 400 B.c. Various considerations tend to confirm this conclusion. The Babylonian Jewish community must have been at least as eager to introduce their manner of Jewish life and practice into Pales</page><page sequence="119">[119] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 119 tine as into Egypt. If then the introduction thereof into Palestine lagged somewhat behind its introduction into Egypt, it must have been because of stronger and more stubborn resistance thereto in Palestine than in Egypt. This is readily comprehen sible. The little Jewish community in Egypt had no long estab lished and fondly cherished traditions with regard to their own antecedent Jewish life and practice. They had apparently mani fested an immediate readiness to adopt Egyptian modes of life and religious observance and to fuse Egyptian culture with their own native Jewish practice. They were distinctly assimilative in spirit. Accordingly they could have had no valid reason for resisting the cultural influence which their pietistic Babylonian brethren now sought to impose upon them, particularly since the latter program had apparently the support of high Persian officials, if not even of the king himself, and since it was there fore to their obvious advantage to conform to it. The surprising thing would have been if the Egyptian Jewish community had not fallen in readily with the plans and purposes of their Baby Ionian coreligionists. Needless to say, however, this conformity to Babylonian Jewish custom and religious observance by the Egyptian Jews must have been altogether superficial and me chanical, without any understanding of the real import and goal thereof. Moreover, this Egyptian Jewish community in the fifth century B.c. must have been of such small extent, and its sub sequent history, in the period following immediately upon the Egyptian nationalistic uprising under Amyrtaeus in 404 B.c., so uncertain and precarious, that its superficial conversion, for such it really was, to the standards and practices of Babylonian Judaism must actually have been of little moment.187 But the Jews of Palestine offered an altogether different situ ation. The mass of them consisted of men and women who them selves and their ancestors before them had never gone into Baby Ionian Exile; or, if perhaps many of their ancestors had, immedi ately after the destruction of the nation in 586 B.c., sought momentary refuge in some neighboring land, Egypt for example, 187 This is evidenced perhaps by the extent to which we find the Jews of Lower Egypt but a century later dominated by Hellenistic cultural influence.</page><page sequence="120">120 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [120] they had returned so soon as circumstances permitted and had resumed their former way of life in all its details. This life was rooted firmly in the soil of Palestine; it was thoroughly Pales tinian in character and tradition. Moreover, as we have seen, immediately after the death of Josiah in 608 b.c., a reaction against the extreme rigorism of the Deuteronomic Reformation had set in, fostered greatly by the religious views and political policies of Jehoiakim. As Jer. 44 shows convincingly, the national cataclysm in 586 b.c. gave impetus to this movement away from the particularistic Deuter onomic interpretation and program of Yahweh-worship back to the pre-Deuteronomic, syncretistic religious practice. Ezek. 8 gives convincing testimony to the extent to which this reaction had realized itself already in the period before 586 B.C., even in the^very'precincts of the Temple itself. Now, as we have also seen, one almost immediate, natural expression of this reaction, coupled with the influence of cogent historical circumstances, must have been the return in large degree, of the non-Sadokite levitical priests to their former, pre Deuteronomic position of authoritative religious leadership. The Deuteronomic program had sought to depose them from this position, and had actually succeeded therein. It had, however, endeavored to provide for them by legislating that such of these non-Sadokite, extra-Jerusalem, levitical priests as might desire, could go up to the central sanctuary at Jerusalem and function there in priestly capacity alongside of their Sadokite brethren.188 But this legislation had reckoned entirely without consideration of the views of the latter group. Not at all unnaturally, the Sado kites were altogether unwilling to share the privileges, preroga tives and authority of the Jerusalem priesthood with their extra Jerusalem brethren. The institution of the single, central sanct uary by the Deuteronomic legislation had played directly into their hands and made them actually the sole priestly function aries and authorities in the land. Under these conditions their influence and material advantages must have increased tremend 188 Deut. 18.6-8, unquestionably a part of the primary stratum of Deuter onomy, dating from 621 B.c.</page><page sequence="121">[121] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 121 ously; and they saw no adequate reason for sharing these with their deposed levitical brethren. Moreover, it is altogether probable that even before the Deuteronomic Reformation there had been more or less rivalry and none the best of relations between the Sadokites in Jerusalem and the levites dwelling in other priestly centers. Certainly Anatot, where the descendants of Ebiatar were dwelling,189 was one of the most important of these centers; and it is quite con ceivable that the ancient rivalry and resultant animosity between the two chief priests of the Jerusalem sanctuary of the first quar ter of the tenth century b.c., Ebiatar and Sadok, had been perpetuated among their descendants down even to the first quarter of the sixth century b.c. The proximity of Anatot to Jerusalem and the constant sight of the Sadokites enjoying sole priestly authority in the national sanctuary must have tended to keep this rivalry and animosity alive. But with the destruction of the Temple in 586 b.c. and the fall of Jerusalem and the nation, the last Sadokites, who remained after the first déporta tion in 597 b.c., must have been carried away into exile. They were too influential a body, too apt to be among the foremost to incite to rebellion, to be left behind in the wholesale déporta tion of actual and potential leaders which Nebuchadrezzar com manded. Here and there an isolated Sadokite may have escaped the fate of his brethren; but if so, then all the more reason for his submerging his identity among his fellow-Israelites, who remained in the land, and disappearing completely from view. But, as has been intimated, the people could not long remain without religious leadership of some kind.190 Despite the lack of direct evidence thereof, a lack readily comprehensible when we remember that the books of the Bible had their final redaction at the hands of Sadokite-Aaronite priests, it is self-evident that shortly after the final deportation in 586 b.c., so soon as con ditions in Palestine under Babylonian administration began to adjust themselves and a semblance of order and of normal exist 189 I Ki. 2.26; cf. Jer. 1.1. Jeremiah was undoubtedly a descendant of Ebiathar and a member of the priestly clan of Anatot. Cf. the import in this direction of the little narrative in II Ki. 17.24-28.</page><page sequence="122">122 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [122] ence to reappear, the former non-Sadokite levitical priests must once again have come into their own.191 They must once again have become the priestly authorities and functionaries for the people who remained constantly dwelling in the land. As has been already suggested, they must have been the levit ical priests of Jer. 33.18, 21 and of Malachi and the priests of Hag. 2.11, 13 and of Zech. 7.3 as well as of both H and Pt. Their position as functionaries in the Second Temple and as judicial and ritual authorities192 must have continued practically undis puted until the advent of Ezra in 458 B.C. A not inconsiderable part of Ezra's program, as the emissary of the Babylonian Jewish community, it is clear, was the restoration of the Sadokite priests to their former position of priestly authority in the Temple at Jerusalem. But, as can be readily imagined, the so-called levitical priests did not yield their position without a bitter struggle, protracted apparently over some forty years.193 It was a signifi cant epoch in the evolution of Judaism, of its institutions and practices. Above all it is perfectly obvious that the Jews of Pales tine, those who had never gone into exile in Babylonia, influenced particularly by their levitical priestly leaders and themselves 1" And among them, no doubt, and in a position of high authority and recognized leadership the priests of Anatot, the descendants of Ebiathar, the first chief-priest of the Jerusalem sanctuary; cf. I Chron. 24.1-6. 192 Cf. particularly Hag. 2.11 ff.; Zech. 7.3; also Deut. 24.8; also 17.10b llaa (cf. M 9, 220 ff.).llaa (cf. M 9, 220 ff.). מי Into the details of this important struggle we may not enter here, tempting though this be. Suffice it to say here that this struggle called forth a number of bitter campaign documents, composed chiefly by the Sadokites. The first of these was apparently Ezek. 40.46; 43.19; 44.6-31, with its uncom promising denunciation of the non-Sadokite, levitical priests as violators of the basic principles of Yahweh-worship. This was followed somewhat later by Pg, with its fiction of the Aaronic priesthood instituted already at the time of Moses, with its artificial genealogical scheme seeking to establish the pri macy of the Aaronite-Sadokites. Within this document the two versions of the Korah story, and also the story of the budding of Aaron's rod and the ensuing legislation, distinguishing between the functions and prerogatives of the Aaronic priests and the levites, in Num. 16-18 are especially illuminative of this struggle. The final triumph of the Aaronite-Sadokites seems to have come, as we shall see, only with the accession of Johanan to the high-priest hood about 411 b.c. (cf. note 212).</page><page sequence="123">[123] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 123 swayed by active anti-Babylonian sentiments,1'4 must have re sisted stoutly the encroachments of Babylonian Jewish influence and the imposition upon themselves of Babylonian Jewish insti tutions. We can readily understand, therefore, why in Palestine the introduction of the Babylonian month names and the Baby Ionian dating of the festivals encountered stubborn opposition and made slower headway than in Egypt. This matter becomes even clearer when we consider the role played by the high-priestly family in this struggle. All the biblical evidence seems to indicate that Joshua was himself actually a Sadokite, who returned from Babylonian exile along with Zeru babel,1'3 and who was an active participant, if not the actual leader, in the rebuilding of the Temple.1'6 According to the var iant accounts in Ezra 2.36-39 and Neh. 7.39-41, on the one hand, and Neh. 12.1-7 on the other, on his return from Babylonia Joshua was accompanied by a group of fellow-priests, presumably Sadokites like himself. To what extent either of these two var iant accounts is authentic is a question seemingly impossible of answer. But there is little reason to doubt that Joshua had a 1«י Cf. above, note 180. In addition to the considerations there set forth, it should be borne in mind that, speaking generally, the Babylonian Jews must have been conscious of and prided themselves upon the fact that their ancestors had been the old leaders of the nation, its rulers, nobles, priests and influential men. They must have felt themselves also to be the elect of Yahweh,Yahweh, destined by Him to regenerate and restore the true Yahweh-life and worship. It is perfectly clear how they evolved their program, of which Ezra and Nehemiah in Palestine and Hananiah in Egypt were the active agents. But, of course, to this doctrine and program the Jews of Palestine could not subscribe. They must have resented it bitterly and opposed it uncompro promisingly. An interesting and illuminating modern parallel is furnished by the attitude of the native Jews of Palestine to the program and activities of the early Zionists. ■« Cf. I Chron. 5.29-41; Ezra 2.2, 8; 5.2; Neh. 7.7; 12.1-7; Hag. 1.1, 14; 2.4;2.4; Zech. 3.1, 8, 9; 6.11. 186 Cf. in particular Zech. 3. Zerubabel himself had disappeared from the historical scene after the fiasco attendant upon the failure of his rebellion, at least four years before the completion and dedication of the second Temple. This task and its completion must therefore have been very largely Joshua's achievement, backed, of course, by the mild, conciliatory policy of the Persian government under Darius I.</page><page sequence="124">124 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [124] small number of his Sadokite brethren associated with him upon his return and in the subsequent administration of the Temple cult. This seems to be the clear implication of Zech. 3.8a. It might be expected, therefore, that the associations of Joshua and his immediate successors in the office of high-priest would be with their Sadokite kinsmen and that they would prove them selves staunch upholders of Sadokite traditions and program, which, as we have seen, were in the early post-Exilic period rooted in Babylonia rather than in Palestine. But whatever may have been the actual cause or causes thereof, the fact is certain that the affiliations of the high-priestly family came, during the first three quarters of the fifth century B.c., to be not at all with the Sadokites and the ritualistic Babylonian Jews, but rather with the Palestinian party, those native Palestinians who had never gone into Babylonian exile, and with their neighbors, especially the Samaritans to the north. With these the Palestinians seem to have lived on fairly congenial terms, to have regarded them as Yahweh-worshipers and Jews, differing from themselves but little, if at all, in the sincerity and intensity of their Judaism. To the general Palestinian concept of Judaism and its affiliations and practice the high-priestly family seems to have subscribed fully. The picture of Joshua in his high-priestly office in Zech. 3 seems to be that of one none too punctilious in the discharge of the ritual duties of his responsible office. Mai. 1.6-2.9 shows too that under Joshua and his immediate successors the levitical priests performed their priestly duties with considerable indif ference and disregard of ritualistic principles; and it is safe to assume that their practice reflected more or less the lax spirit of their highest priestly authorities. In the days of Ezra and Nehemiah Eliashib, the then high-priest, was a consistent and vigorous opponent of their Babylonian program. True, Neh. 3.1, 28 record that Eliashib and the priests participated in the rebuild ing of the walls of Jerusalem immediately after Nehemiah's first coming. But thereafter Nehemiah seems to have experienced only uncompromising opposition from Eliashib and his household, with, however, as we shall see, one significant exception. Eli ashib's own grandson was married -to a daughter of Sanballat,</page><page sequence="125">[125] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 125 undoubtedly with his grandfather's, or at least his father's ap proval,"7 and other members of the high priestly family had likewise contracted intermarriages."8 And in the interval between Nehemiah's two visits to Jerusalem Eliashib had established a near relative of Tobiah within the very Temple chambers."® And, as has been frequently noted by commentators and his torians, Eliashib's name and the names of members of his house hold are significantly absent from the signatories of the compact promoted by Nehemiah.200 Moreover, as Neh. 6.17-19 attests, at just this period many of the lay nobles of the Palestinian community, those who must, along with the high-priestly family, have been the true aristocracy, the real leaders of the people and the molders of its spirit and policies during the period before the advent of Ezra and Nehemiah, were intermarried with Tobiah and his family, or at least in intimate and cooperative relations with him. They too were the bitter opponents of Ezra and Nehe miah and their Babylonian, particularistic program. And in their antagonism to this Babylonian program they had the hearty support of the professional prophets of the day,201 undoubtedly the influential spokesmen of the native popular opinion and policy. From all this evidence it is abundantly clear that, regardless of what their original Sadokite ancestry, traditions and affilia tions may have been, by the middle of the fifth century B.c. the high-priestly family was definitely allied with the Palestinians against the Babylonian program of Ezra and Nehemiah. They must accordingly have also been allied with the levitical priests, י" Neh. 13.28. 8יי Ezra 10.18-22; notice too that according to Ezra 10.5 Ezra challenges the levitical priests to send away their foreign wives. The use of the term הכהנים הלוים here, particularly when contrasted with Ezra 7.1-7 ; 8.15-19, 24-30, where reference is made to the priests who returned with Ezra, and the contrast is clearly drawn between priests and levites, may well indicate that in Ezra 10.5, 18-22 those priests who had been functioning in Palestine before the advent of Ezra are all subsumed under the head of "levitical priests." Only these, it is implied, had intermarried. '«» Neh. 13.4-9. Neh. 10. "1 Neh. 6.14.</page><page sequence="126">126 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [126J whose leaders they had been for upward of three quarters of a century, against the claims and pretensions of their Sadokite kinsmen, who had returned with Ezra,202 to a position of sole priestly authority and ministration in the Temple, with the con sequent exclusion, or at least with the reduction to an inferior position of the levitical priests. Only one single member of the high-priestly family seems to have diverged from this general family policy and affiliation. Ezra 10.6 records the intimate association of Ezra with Johanan, the grandson203 of Eliashib. In the latter's chamber within the Temple Ezra found more or less temporary sojourn. This can mean only that, in significant contrast to the remainder of the high-priestly family, Johanan had become a staunch supporter of Ezra and his particularistic, Babylonian program. We shall see this same Johanan later discharging the duties of the high priestly office in a rigorous, uncompromising, particularistic man ner, altogether in accord with the policies and program of Ezra and Nehemiah. Evidently, already in his youth, some thirty or more years before he became high-priest, he must have been animated by this same particularistic, separatistic zeal, and this must have led him to repudiate the milder, more tolerant, assimi lative policies of his family and become an open and ardent sup porter of Ezra, and later no doubt also of Nehemiah. Nothing further is heard of Johanan for many years, until the record of his slaying of his brother Jesus, or Joshua, within the very Temple precincts.204 Eliashib had been succeeded as high-priest by his son Joiada. That Joiada conformed fully to the assimilative policies of his family may be inferred from the fact that his son, Manasseh, married the daughter of Sanballat,205 unquestionably with his father's full approval. The murder of 202 Cf. note 198. 203 That Johanan was not the son of Eliashib, but his grandson, is amply attested by Neh. 12.22; cf. also vv. 10-11. 20י• Josephus, Antiquities, XI, 7, 1. 205 That Manasseh was the son of Joiada, and not of Johanan, as Josephus has it (op. cit., 2), is established definitely by Neh. 13.28, and also by the con sideration that the fanatic particularist, Johanan, would never have sanctioned such a marriage with a, to him, foreign woman.</page><page sequence="127">[127] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 127 Jesus by Johanan must have been far more than a mere personal incident. Josephus states very plainly that Jesus too was an aspirant for the high-priesthood, and that in this ambition he enjoyed the support of Bagoas, the then Persian governor of Palestine. This Bagoas must have been the successor of Nehe miah in this high office, though whether the immediate succès sor, lack of evidence forbids us to determine. Josephus represents him as pursuing a policy of oppression of the Jews of Palestine, but this probably overstates the case. Josephus wrote, of course, from the standpoint of the extreme particularism of Ezra and Nehemiah which came in time, and with only comparatively slight amelioration, to dominate the spirit of Judaism for cen turies. But Josephus does record that this Bagoas supported Jesus in his candidacy for the high-priesthood; and this was certainly the same Bagoas to whom in 408 B.c. the Jews of Elephantine addressed their petition for permission to rebuild their temple of Yahweh. Moreover, it is significant that not only did Bagoas grant the desired permission, but also that in so doing he associated himself with Delaiah, the son of Sanballat, the Samaritan.206 It seems clear therefore that Bagoas was not so much an enemy and oppressor of the entire Jewish community of Palestine as that he sought to play a role of partisan politics in their affairs. Obviously too his affiliations were with the native Palestinian and against the pro-Babylonian Jewish party, as his association with Delaiah, the son of Sanballat, indicates. 06נ It is an additional matter of interest and perhaps also of significance that the order of Bagoas permitted the offering of grain-sacrifices and incense upon the altar of the Yahweh-temple at Elephantine, but was altogether silent with regard to animal sacrifices. Undoubtedly this silence implied that the sacrifice of animals was not permitted, perhaps, as Cowley suggests {op. cit., 124), following Ed. Meyer, because such sacrifices would have done violence to the religious scruples of a zealous Zoroastrian. However, whatever the motive for this prohibition may have been, it is impossible not to correlate it with the fact recorded by Josephus, that Bagoas levied upon the Jews of Pal estine a tax of fifty shekels for every Iamb slaughtered for the daily sacrifice in the Temple. A tax so extreme must have been almost prohibitive. This may therefore well have been a superficially diplomatic means by which Bagoas sought to abrogate the offering of animal sacrifices also in the Temple at Jerusalem.</page><page sequence="128">128 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [128] Clearly it represents a policy and a political association quite the reverse of that of his predecessor, Nehemiah. This is easily comprehensible. The fact that Bagoas, a Persian, succeeded Nehemiah, a Jew, as 207פחה is sufficient to indicate a complete reversal of policy on the part of the Persian government in the management of the internal affairs of Palestine.208 Furthermore, if we understand that Bagoas was a supporter of the native Palestinian party in the internal politics of the Jewish community of Palestine, we can appreciate all the better the full import of his advocacy of the claims of Jesus to the high priesthood against those of Johanan. Undoubtedly Jesus cham pioned the assimilative, pro-Palestinian policies of his ancestors; accordingly he must have endorsed fully the marriage of his brother with the sister of the very Delaiah, the son of Sanballat, who joined with Bagoas in permitting the reconstruction of the sanctuary of Yahweh in Yeb. Presumably Delaiah too supported Jesus, the brother of his own brother-in-law, in his candidacy for the high-priesthood. But correspondingly then Johanan, the rival claimant to the high-priesthood, must have enjoyed the backing of the particularistic, pro-Babylonian Jewish party. Obviously therefore he continued throughout his entire life the particularistic, separatistic policies and the politico-religious affil iations which he had begun with his association with Ezra and his endorsement of the latter's program implied in this associa tion. Manifestly then the struggle for the high-priesthood be tween Johanan and Jesus was less a personal than a party strug gle, with political as well as religious implications. This brings into clearer light too the reasons for Johanan's ignoring the appeal of the Jews of Elephantine for aid in rebuild ing their temple. Not only was the very idea of a second temple 0נ' For פחה as the title of the Persian governor of Palestine during this period, cf.

He seems to have chosen the former and simpler course. But all the more therefore can we understand the motives which impelled Bagoas and Delaiah to lend a ready ear to the appeal of the Jews of Yeb. Manifestly not merely sympathy, but likewise, and no doubt to an even greater degree, political considerations and antagonism to the particularistic policies of Johanan and his party influenced their policy. This appeal of the Elephantine Jews was made in 408 B.c. Johanan was then, it is clear, the undisputed high-priest. In all likelihood he had become high-priest only a few years before this 20» Upon some other occasion I hope to discuss the question, just what constituted the Torah of Ezra, and to show that, not the Priestly Code, as is generally assumed (cf. Meyer, Die Entstehung des Judentums, 199-234), but the Holiness Code, the Deuteronomic Code, and probably also the Book of the Covenant, and likewise, of course, the narratives of JE, constituted the Torah which Ezra read to the people, as is recounted in Neh. 8. """" Which the papyri attest amply. The provision of Deut. 23.8-9 that the Egyptian might enter the קהל ירוה in the third generation is undoubtedly the product of the period some what later than this, when the extreme particularism of Ezra, Nehemiah and Johanan had abated somewhat, and accordingly the provision had come to be made in P for the admission into the Jewish community of the נר or proselyte (cf. Bertholet, Die Stellung der Israeliten und der Juden zu den Fremden, 176 178) under certain conditions. Unquestionably too this law in Deut. 23.8-9 had in mind, not native Egyptians as such, but rather Egyptian Jews or half Jews, probably those of Elephantine as well as those of Lower Egypt in general, the Alexandrian Jews of the following centuries.</page><page sequence="130">130 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [130] date.212 The accession of Johanan to the high-priesthood seems to mark the final triumph of the particularistic pro-Babylonian 112 We may assume with reasonable probability that the year 408 B.c. fell in the seven-year period recorded by Josephus {op. cit.), of extreme and aggressive antagonism of Bagoas to Johanan and his party, following upon the murder of Jesus and the accession of Johanan to the high-priesthood. This would narrow the moment of Johanan's becoming high-priest to the period between 414 and 408 B.c. Other weighty considerations tend to confirm this date. On the one hand, Eliashib was certainly the high-priest still in 432 B.c. (cf. Neh. 13), and probably even for some short time thereafter. He was sue ceeded by his son Joiada, who, no doubt, functioned for a reasonable period of years. On the other hand, Jaddua, the son of Johanan, was, according to Josephus {Antiquities, XI, 7, 2; cf. JE, VII, 51) high-priest at the time of the advent of Alexander the Great in 332 B.C., although, of course, a very old man at the time. This implies that Johanan and Jaddua together must have held the office of high-priest for approximately eighty years. This is indeed an extremely long period, yet one by no means impossible, particularly if we bear in mind that the tradition records that six high-priests functioned during the entire period from 516 b.c. to 332 b.c., i. e., an average of over thirty-one years of service for each man. However, these considerations suggest that the date of the accession of Johanan to the high-priesthood should be brought down as late as possible. 411 B.c. would, of course, be the terminus ad quem for this, since the papyri record definitely that Johanan was the high-priest in that year. Further data, however, enable us to fix with a large measure of probability the date of Johanan's becoming high-priest even more exactly, and also cast interesting light upon the significant political situation in Jerusalem in that day. Papyrus #30, 18-19 and its practical duplicate, papyrus #31, 17-18 tell that at the time of the destruction of their temple in 411 B.c. the Jews of Yeb sent letters describing their sad lot to Bagoas and also to Johanan, here called explicitly כהנא רבא, "high-priest," and his companions, the priests of Jerusalem, and to Ustan, the brother of Anani, and the חרי יהודיא or חר' 'הוד, "the nobles of the Jews." It is not quite clear whether two letters were sent at this time or three letters, one certainly to Bagoas, one to Johanan and his fellow-priests and one to Ustan and the nobles, or one to Johanan and his fellow-priests and Ustan and the nobles together. However, the weight of evidence seems to indi cate that only two letters were sent (note the wording of papyrus 31). No reply was received by the Jews of Elephantine to either or any of these letters. Ac cordingly three years later, in 408 B.c., they wrote again, to Bagoas, but did not address Johanan and the other former addressees again, but apparently in their stead sent a letter of appeal for aid to Delaiah and Shelemiah, the sons of Sanballat. Now why this radical change of procedure? Undoubtedly because by 408 b.c. they had come to understand a number of important matters about which they were still uninformed in 411 B.c. First they knew now that Bagoas and Johanan were enemies and leaders of opposite factions in internal Jewish pol itics, and that therefore they could now hope to win favor from Bagoas only</page><page sequence="131">1131] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 131 party over its Palestinian opponents, at least in religious and ritualistic matters. True, under Nehemiah the pro-Babylonian if they refrained from appealing to Johanan and his associates, and also if they gave to Bagoas a clear intimation that, in contrast to their former procedure, they were now appealing only to him and disregarding Johanan completely. Furthermore, it seems clear that by this time they had learned of Johanan's extreme separatistic policy and program, and therefore they had come to real ize that they might expect neither aid nor even sympathy from him and his party. And they added, at the very end of their letter, and apparently almost as an after-thought, but one which, they were confident, would be approved by Bagoas, that they had likewise written to the sons of Sanballat. Undoubt edly they had learned also of the friendly and cooperative relations existing between Bagoas and the sons of Sanballat. And since no intimation was given in their letter of the outcome of their appeal to the sons of Sanballat, it may be inferred that it had been made only quite recently. In other words, their appeal to Delaiah and Shelemiah now took the place of their appeal three years earlier to Johanan and his associates. Presumably in 411 B.C. they had assumed that their appeal to Johanan, in his capacity as high-priest, would suffice and that there was no particular need of an appeal to the sons of San ballat. Certainly it was not that they wished to ignore any aid which might be forthcoming from this latter source. Apparently they had assumed in 411 B.C. that the relations of Johanan, the high-priest, to the Samaritans and to Sanballat and his sons, were the same as those of Johanan's grandfather, and apparently of his father also, viz., friendly and intimate, the close relations of intermarriage and political co operation. They could not yet have learned that Johanan had inaugurated a particularistic policy altogether the reverse of that of his immediate predeces sors in office. This is confirmed by the fact that they addressed themselves also to the nobles, for manifestly they assumed that the nobles of Jerusalem were also still in the most intimate relations with Sanballat and the Samaritans, still supporters of a policy of assimilation, and opponents of the program of extreme particularism, just as they had been in the days of Eliashib and of Nehemiah (cf. Neh. 6.17 and also 13.17). Clearly in 411 b.c. the Jews of Elephantine were not yet intimately acquainted with the new conditions which had come to obtain in Jerusalem. By 408 B.C. they were fully informed and so could act more discreetly. But obviously they could have been uninformed in 411 B.c. of the new conditions which had come to obtain in Jerusalem only because these changes had transpired very recently. Apparently they knew no more then than that Johanan was the high-priest. All this points to the con elusion that Johanan must just have become high-priest, either in 411 B.C., or at the very earliest in 412 B.c. (Somewhat similar conclusions have been reached in part by Birkeland, "Drei Bemerkungen zu den Elephantine Papyri, 1-3 [ed. Sachau], in Acta Orientalia, XII [1934], 81-90 [quoted from ZAW, XI (1934), 1331). {See page 148.)</page><page sequence="132">132 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [132] party had apparently gained the upper hand in political affairs; but, despite the fact that Nehemiah had unquestionably acted with ruthless vigor in his opposition to Eliashib, the high-priest, and his family affiliations and policies, it is quite clear that he had not succeeded entirely in controlling the high-priesthood and in thereby shaping completely and definitively the development of the religion and of the ritual practice. That the policies and affiliations of the high-priestly family had remained unchanged throughout the entire period of Nehemiah's governorship is amply attested by the incident recorded in Neh. 13.4-9 and even more by the marriage of the son of Joiada with the daughter of Sanballat. Manifestly not until the accession of Johanan to the high-priesthood did the pro-Babylonian party come to control that exalted office, and with it, of course, the entire priesthood and the ritual. This event must accordingly have marked the definitive triumph of the Sadokite-Aaronite priests, returned from Babylonian exile, over their levitical brethren, those not of the Sadokite branch, who had never gone into exile, and the relegation of these to the position of underlings in the Temple cult. In other words, this must have been the time of the formula tion and promulgation of the Priestly Code proper, viz., Pg."3 With this historical background clearly in mind we can readily understand that up to the moment of the accession of Johanan to the high-priesthood the opposition in Palestine to the program of the pro-Babylonian party must have been strong and effective, sufficiently so at least to make the introduction of the various religious elements of this Babylonian program into Palestinian religious practice lag somewhat behind the corresponding devel opment in the religious life and practice of the Jews of Elephan tine. But with the accession of Johanan to the high-priesthood and the final triumph of the pro-Babylonian, particularistic party, the Babylonian program naturally began to make ready headway in Palestine also. In this period and under these con 313 Cf. above, note 193. It is probably not without significance in this con nection that Neh. 12.22 makes specific record of the levites, as distinguished from the priests, only from the days of Eliashib on, while v. 23 seems to imply that some event, vague in character, but of large import, bearing upon their status, transpired in the days of Johanan.</page><page sequence="133">[133] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 133 ditions and influences we must set the beginnings of the reorgan ization of the calendar and the gradual emergence of Calendar III to replace Calendar II, which, as we have seen, are definitely reflected in early P2 writings, following no doubt speedily upon the formulation and adoption of Pg. In fact we can be a bit more specific in determining what was in all likelihood the very first step in this process. Neh. 8 records the important incident of Ezra's reading of the Torah to the people during the first days of the seventh month. As we have shown elsewhere,214 the occasion was the celebration of the Sukkot festival from VII/3 through VII/9, and the reading of the Torah upon this occasion was undoubtedly in conformity with the secondary Deuteronomic legislation in Deut. 31.10-11. Upon the second day of the reading, i. e., VII/2, the day before the actual beginning of the festival, Ezra came to that portion of the Torah which commanded the celebration of the festival. Accordingly the people eagerly prepared for the joyful event by going out to the neighboring mountains and gathering there the boughs and foliage of five different kinds of trees with which they built booths, in which they sojourned during the entire period of the festival. This dwelling in booths, it is clear, constituted for them, the distinctive ceremony of the festival celebration. And as v. 17 says explicitly, the festival had not been celebrated in this manner from the days of Joshua until that very day. This means, of course, on the one hand, the assumption of Mosaic legislation for the celebration of the festival in this particular manner, but also, on the other hand, that this was actually an altogether new method of celebrating the festival, a distinct innovation.215 Now there can be no question that the passage of the Torah to which Neh. 8.14 refers is Lev. 23.39-43.216 That is the only 214Ml, 28-35; cf. also above, pp. 56 f. 2's Cf. the parallel statement in II Ki. 23.32 with regard to the celebration of the Passover in the eighteenth year of Josiah in accordance with the legis lation, or rather with the original, D1 stratum of the legislation, in Deut. 16.1-8. That too was an altogether novel manner of celebrating that festival, entirely unknown before the promulgation of that legislation. 216 Cf. above, p. 56.</page><page sequence="134">134 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [134] passage of the entire Pentateuch which makes reference to var ious kinds of plants and trees used in the ritual of the Sukkot festival and likewise commands the ceremony of dwelling in booths during the festival period. At first glance the relation of this passage to Neh. 8.14 ff. seems simple and direct. But closer examination of the two passages brings various matters of im portance to light. In the first place, Neh. 8.15 specifies five different trees from which the booths were to be built, while Lev. 23.40 specifies only four kinds of trees. Nor do the two pas sages agree at all as to the species. Only two of the four species of trees listed in Lev. 23.40 occur also in Neh. 8.15, viz., the palm and the myrtle.217 But, whereas Lev. 23.40 likewise specifies the willow and the somewhat uncertain 218,עץ הדר Neh. 8.15 mentions "י"י Accepting this, the traditional interpretation, for the rather uncertain עץ עבות. But it should be noted that הדס or הדסה is the regular word for myrtle, and that both terms, הדס and עץ עבות, occur in Neh. 8.15. 218 It seeems very probable that the difficult הדר of Lev. 23.40 is a corrup tion of an original הדס. This solution of this troublesome problem is so simple and ready-to-hand that it is surprising not to find that it had been proposed previously. If this emendation be accepted, then it would follow that three of the four plants of Lev. 23.40 are specified among the five plants of Neh. 8.15. In that case only the willow of Lev. 23.40 would be missing in Neh. 8.15, and for it the foliage of the olive and the wild olive would have been substi tuted. This would reduce the divergence of the two passages to a minimum. It would also serve to identify the thyrsus of Lev. 23.40 more readily with the hoia'na'hoia'na' (cf. above, note 90), and would also obviate the difficulty experienced by post-biblical religious authorities in fixing the precise ritual for the festival, that the lulab was to be held in one hand and the 'etrog in the other (cf. Suk kah, 31b; Orah Hayyim, 651); for, inasmuch as the entire ritual of the 'etrog developed out of the rather forced interpretation of this difficult and obscure פרי עץ הדר, if we should read הדס for הדר, the entire basis for the 'etrog would be removed, and there would remain only the lulab. It seems therefore most probable that all that the ritual of Lev. 23.40b contemplated was the lulab or thyrsus made of the four plants intertwined. Bearing upon this proposed emendation of הדר to הדס in Lev. 23.40, it is interesting to note that LXX renders פרי עץ הדר with meticulous faithfulness καρττονκαρττον ξύλου ώραΐον, seemingly, in its despair over the difficult and incompre hensible phrase, interpreting הדר as an adjective modifying פרי. This is, of course, impossible, since the context clearly requires here the name of a specific kind of tree. Now it is doubly interesting to correlate with this the description of of the lulab in II Macc. 10.7 made of "leaves, fair branches and palms" (ΰίφσουί και κλάδους ώρα Lous, in St και φοίνικας), κλάδους ωραίους would probably</page><page sequence="135">[135] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 135 instead the olive, the wild olive and the הדס. Furthermore, Lev. 23.40 prescribes, not the foliage alone of the four species of trees which it mentions, but rather the fruit of the עץ הדר, palm twigs or leaves, and the foliage of the myrtle and willow. In significant contrast Neh. 8.15 specifies only the leaves of the five trees which it prescribes. With these far-reaching divergences between these two passages, it is impossible to conceive that precisely the same ceremony was contemplated in each case. The actual procedure described in Neh. 8.15 manifestly represents a conscious, and no doubt a purposed, departure from the command in Lev. 23.40a, upon which it is based. Now we have shown*1' that in the paragraph in Lev. 23.39-43, w. 42-43a must be secondary. They follow irrationally after a colophon which obviously marks the conclusion of a unified body of legislation, and they likewise reinterpret in significant manner the content and spirit of the original H legislation and of the ritual practice which it prescribes. This original legislation, as we have seen, provided for the ceremony with the lulab. Carried in ritual procession about the altar and shaken in various directions in prescribed manner,*20 this undoubtedly constituted an old fertility rite, of patently non-Yahwistic, Canaanite origin, which had, however, through long-protracted, syncretistic processes, been definitely incorporated into the established folk-celebration of the Asif festival. Apparently, as we have suggested, the Deut eronomic reformers, conscious of the non-Yahwistic origin and character of the lulab ceremony, had, in their legislation for the festival in Deut. 16.13-15, refused to sanction the rite, and by silence had sought to suppress its observance. Seemingly too, in a manner quite characteristic, the H legislators, reacting against the rigorism of their Deuteronomic predecessors, and in full reflect a Hebrew equivalent צמחי הדר. Apparently here the author of II Macc., no doubt an Alexandrian Jew (cf. Moffatt, in Charles, Apocrypha and Pseude-, Apocrypha and Pseude pigraphapigrapha of the 0. Τ., I, 131), followed LXX closely but, through failure to understand what was in itself actually not understandable, he retained the troublesome ώραϊον, but mistakenly gave to it a new and even more impog sible connection.

Above, note 90,</page><page sequence="136">136 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [136] accord with their own established principle of harmonization of and compromise with ineradicable folk-practice, had sanctioned the lulab ceremony anew in their legislation in Lev. 23.40. But, as we have seen also, vv. 42-43a, particularly when interpreted, as unquestionably they must be, in conjunction with Neh. 8.13 17, clearly reinterpret the lulab-ceremony of Lev. 23.40a. The old fertility rite, with its obvious non-Yahwistic origin and implica tions, is completely changed, and by this change is to all intents abrogated once again. The fruit of the hadar tree, indispensable for the lulab, is ignored entirely, and stress is laid only upon the foliage of the plants of the original rite. The three specific species of trees of the lulab, obviously playing their role in the original rite because of some magical properties, connected perhaps with the rainfall, supposedly inherent in them, have now become five species, presumably of somewhat indiscriminate character. And the foliage of these five trees is used, no longer in a ritual célébra tion at the altar, but as the material of which the festival booths, prescribed in Lev. 23.42-43a, are made, and in which the people are bidden to sojourn during the seven days of the festival. Furthermore, we have established that Lev. 23.40b is also secondary. Moreover, in the light of our discussion up to this point it is apparent that v. 40b too really aims to modify and reinterpret something of the content and spirit of the ancient festival celebration. We have seen likewise221 that the command in v. 40b to rejoice before Yahweh in the celebration of the festi val is strongly reminiscent of Deuteronomic legislation. But, as we have seen also, this specific command to rejoice before Yah weh in the celebration of this particular festival, clearly an edi torial insertion here into the original H legislation, reminds us unmistakably of Ezra's charge to the people, gathered to hear the reading of the Torah during the course of the festival, not to mourn nor weep but to eat, drink, send gifts to the needy, and in general to observe these days as days of positive rejoicing.222 It is clear too that the celebration of the festival with rejoicing in this manner, particularly at its very beginning, was itself a decided innovation, for, conforming to the pattern of their Can aanite origins, these agricultural festivals began ordinarily with 1 Above, p. 54. ננ־ Neh. 8.9-12.</page><page sequence="137">[137] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 137 rites of mourning and weeping, which changed only gradually during the course of the seven-day festival celebration to merry making and license and culminated upon the last day or upon the day following in the dances of the maidens in the vineyards and their attendant scenes of religio-magical sexual rites."3 That the people were still impelled to celebrate this festival in the old, conventional manner is evidenced by vv. 10-12. From this they were dissuaded, and the new character of the festival and manner ©f its celebration were impressed upon them by Ezra and his associates. And certainly this decided innovation, coupled with the substitution of the building and dwelling in booths during the seven days of the festival for the more ancient fertility rite with the lulab, establish this as an altogether novel way of cele brating this festival and justify fully the claim of v. 17, that never since the days of Joshua had the festival been celebrated in this manner. But just as the ceremony of making and dwelling in booths, adorned with the foliage of the five different species of trees, as the essential festival rite must be dependent upon Lev. 23.42-43a, so also must the celebration of the festival from its very begin ning as a period of unqualified rejoicing and merry-making, and with the complete abrogation of all the former rites of mourning incidental to its conventional beginning, so intimately associated with Canaanite Tammuz-worship, be dependent upon v. 40b. Both provisions, obviously directed to one and the same end, viz., to purge the festival celebration of rites of patently non Yahwistic, Canaanite origin, must be a unit, the work of one, single zealous and agressive reformer. And assuredly this could have been none other than Ezra himself. Certainly to rid the official cult of Yahweh of all rites which smacked in any way of foreign, and particularly of Canaanite origins and influences, must have been an integral part of his general particularistic program. Nor apparently could any more effective method of achieving this end be devised than to base it upon ostensible Mosaic legislation, formulated by Ezra himself to meet this situation and inserted by him into the appropriate place in the י Cf. Jud. 21.19-23; Jer. 41.4 f.; also M 4, 42-46.</page><page sequence="138">138 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [138] corpus of traditional Mosaic law accepted and official in that day. After all this was no imposition nor forgery. Just this was the established practice of all Ezra's legislative predecessors, to represent their legislation as of Mosaic origin so that in one way or another it might eventually come to be incorporated into the accepted corpus of Mosaic law, from the days of the K and C legislators in the ninth century B.C., through the Deuteronomic reformers and the legislators of the Holiness Code and the Torah section of P, down to Ezra's own day. The canon of Mosaic law was as yet far from being closed. Countless additions to and inser - tions into it in similar manner and spirit continued to be made for at least two centuries after Ezra. And even after the canon of the Torah had been formally closed, and it had been definitely determined that nothing must henceforth be added thereto and nothing taken therefrom,224 popular tradition, and even the con scious representation of the responsible religious leaders and legislators of that comparatively late day continued to proclaim that the gradually evolving oral law was also of Mosaic origin and authority. Ezra's procedure then in inserting vv. 40b and 42-43a into the older H paragraph, Lev. 23.39ff., was in full conformity with long-established and long-persisting practice, and was in no sense a pious fraud practiced upon a gullible and unsuspecting people.25 Nor could anything be more natural than that Ezra's legis lation, v. 40b, inserted into a body of older H legislation, should merely reaffirm the former Deuteronomic command to celebrate the festival with rejoicing before Yahweh.226 For we have seen 22* Deut. 4.2. That the use of the lulab in the ritual of the Sukkot festival was subse quently revived, or rather relegitimized, is evidenced by the record thereof in the second Temple (cf. Josephus, Antiquities, III, 10, 4; XIII, 13, 5; Sukkah. Ill, 1 ff.). It must have been a ceremony too deeply rooted in folk-practice to be abrogated by mere, and actually indirect, legislation. Not improbably it was in connection with this revival of the use of the lulab that the 'etrog was officially introduced into the ritual, based, as has been said, upon an arti ficialficial interpretation of פרי עץ הדר of Lev. 23.40. For evidence that this was in the late Persian or in the early Hellenistic period, i. e., after Ezra, cf. Tolkowsky, "The Meaning of פר' עץ הדר (Lev. XXIII.40)", JPOS, VIII (1928), 17-23. 226 Deut. 16.4.</page><page sequence="139">[139] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 139 that in a very conscious and positive sense the festival legislation of H represents a reaction against the extreme rigorism and particularism of Deut. and a readiness to compromise with per sistent folk-practice and to adapt rites and institutions of ancient, pre-Yahwistic, Canaanite religion to the Yahweh-cult. But equally plainly, the religious and social reforms of Ezra and Nehemiah, marked by the most extreme and ruthless particular ism, represent a counter-reaction against the harmonistic and assimilative tendencies of H and of the pronounced universalism which dominated the period from about 540 B.c. to about 485 B.c., and a return to and further expansion of the particular istic and rigoristic spirit of the original Deuteronomic legisla tion. Therefore, that Ezra should in Lev. 23.40b have reaffirmed the old Deuteronomic program of festival celebration, with specific application to the former, Canaanite rites of mourning and weeping at the commencement of the festival,"7 need be not at all surprising. "י As we have seen already (above, note 81), outside of this one passage Lev. 23.40b, the expression שפח לפני יהוה occurs only in Deut. 12.7, 12, 18; 14.26; 16.11, 14; 26.11; 27.7. The phrase לפני יהוה undoubtedly implies that this particular "rejoicing" was a positive ritual act in the reformulated Yahweh-cult of the Deuteronomic Reformation. The Deuteronomic influence in Lev. 23.40b is unmistakable. Moreover, of the eight Deuteronomic passages listed above, in which the expression שסח לפני יהוה occurs, I have been com pelled, in my analysis of Deuteronomy, for quite independent and cogent reasons, to regard 12.7, 12, 18; 26.11; 27.7 as secondary, and all, with the pos sible exception of 12.18, as coming from the post-Exilic period, i. e., the very same period as witnessed the insertion of Lev. 23.40b into its present setting. This does not imply, of course, that these five passages must necessarily be also the work of Ezra. But the recognition of the post-Exilic date as well as the exclusively Deuteronomic character of these five passages lend strong con firmation to our conclusion of the post-Exilic date and character of Lev. 23.40b, and with this, of course, though indirectly, to our contention that Ezra must have been the author of Lev. 23.40b and 42-43a. But if we admit, as we must, on the one hand, the Deuteronomic character of Lev. 23.40b, and, on the other hand, that Ezra was the author of this half verse, then we must draw the further conclusion, as we have already suggested, that, despite his unquestioned relations to the authors of the somewhat later Priestly Code, Ezra was also one of the post-Exilic Deuteronomists. Into this interesting and important question we may not enter fully here, for it would carry us far afield. But the one question is pertinent here, whether Deut. 31.9</page><page sequence="140">140 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [140] Likewise the assumption that vv. 42-43a are also the work of Ezra gives added significance to the provision in v. 42b that the אזרח, the born Jew, must dwell in a booth during the festival 13, upon which unquestionably Ezra's reading of the Torah to the people, gathered in the eastern court of the Temple for the celebration of the Sukkot festival, was based, was not likewise a piece of legislation framed by Ezra himself and inserted by him into its present position in the Torah just in order to provide, on the basis of ostensible Mosaic legislation, for the festival assem bly with the ceremonial reading of the Torah and the ensuing program of particularistic, religious and social reforms which he was planning. Such a procedure of legislative expansion of Deut. 31 would, it must be admitted, parallel exactly the insertion of Lev. 23.40b, 42-43a into their present posi tions. The hypothesis has everything to commend it. On the basis of independent internal evidence (note [a] the total lack of connection in thought with any thing which either precedes or follows in the chapter; [b] that in v. 10 the Sab batical year is already an established, national institution; that, in other words, this passage is secondary to Deut. 15 [cf. M 9, 40 f.] ; [c] that here the Sukkot festival still comes at the end, i. e., on the very last seven days, of the year, just as, as we have learned, was the practice still in Ezra's time [above, pp. 56 f. ; [d] that the concept of the Torah in the custody of the levitical priests [v. 9b, undoubtedly secondary and very late, records a different tradition of the eus todianship of the Torah, in the hands of the elders of the people, the first out spoken record of which is found apparently, not in the Bible itself, but only in the Mishna ('Abot, I, 1)], basic to this paragraph, can not possibly be ascribed to Dl, since according to D1 legislation [Deut. 18.6-8] the levitical priests in general were disfranchised; it must instead be ascribed to a secondary and undoubtedly post-Exilic stratum of Deut. Both concepts here, of Torah and of the role and authority of the levitical priests, agree perfectly with the conditions which obtained in the days of Ezra, particularly at the beginning of his ministrations and before the struggle between these levitical priests and the the returning Sadokites had become acute.) I have had to assign Deut. 31.9-13 to a post-Exilic Deuteronomic redactor. Obviously this passage is altogether in the spirit and reflects the conditions of Ezra's time and program. Certainly, granting that it be post-Exilic, it can not be much earlier than Ezra; nor yet can it be much later. In all likelihood it is the product of his very day. And since it has such a patently direct relationship to one important step in the carrying out of his program, and since, moreover, as I hope to show at some more fitting time and place, such insertions of scattered bits of legislation into the Torah, and particularly into Deut., were a not infrequent procedure on the part of both Ezra and Nehemiah, it seems not at all amiss to regard Deut. 31.9-13 (minus certain still later secondary insertions of altogether minor char acter, viz., vv. 9a/3b and 12a, if not the whole of vv. 12-13) likewise as the work of Ezra and coming from 458 B.c. As we have seen (above, note 107) this was a Sabbatical year.</page><page sequence="141">[141] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 141 period in order to celebrate the festival properly. We have seen that, outside of this one single passage, the term אזרח occurs in the Hexateuch only in P. We have seen too that this is the only passage in the entire Bible in which this word is used alone, with out its regular complement, נר. Furthermore, Deuteronomic legis lation throughout provides for the free participation of the גר in the cult of Yahweh, and in particular in the celebration of the Asif or Sukkot festival. 228 Clearly therefore this legislation, which seems by intent to limit the privilege, or at least the obli gation, of participation in the festival celebration only to native Jews, and thereby to tacitly deny this privilege to the גר, can not possibly be regarded as Deuteronomic; nor, of course, as its very presence in an H setting implies, can it possibly be assigned to a pre-Exilic date. Neither does it accord with the harmonizing and assimilative spirit of the H legislation nor can it be the product of the period of rampant universalism from about 540 B.c. to 485 B.c. Still less may this half-verse be assigned to P, for, as we have also learned, P too makes generous provision for the participation of the נר, under certain conditions, in the célébra tion of the festivals.229 Unless we follow the previously cited sug gestion of Bertholet and supply גר here, a procedure for which there is not the slightest justification other than Bertholet's con fessed inability to account for the use of the term אזרח unaccom panied by נר in only this one, single passage, we must conclude that there is only one period, happily very brief, in all the history of Israel in biblical times, to which this little piece of extreme particularistic legislation can possibly be assigned. It is the period of violent reaction against the dominant universalism of 540-485 B.c., which culminated in the bitter particularism of Ezra, Nehemiah and Johanan, the period extending from the advent of Ezra in 458 B.c. to the death of Johanan, the high-priest, about 383 b.c. But into the spirit of this particular period and the literature which it called forth this little piece of legislation fits perfectly. Assigning this half-verse to this period, we are enabled to comprehend that which Bertholet was unable to "* Deut. 16.14; cf. above, note 92. Cf. note 91.</page><page sequence="142">142 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [142] account for, viz., just why this half-verse speaks of the אזרח alone, without mention, and by implication to the exclusion, of the גר. It was manifestly because in the particularistic program of Ezra there was no place whatever for him who was not born a Jew. Moreover, the simple fact that this is the only passage in the Hexateuch outside of the Priestly Code in which the term אזרח occurs is itself significant. This is unquestionably the oldest instance of its use in all biblical literature. The word is obviously a technical term, which designates a definite and closed group within the population of Palestine. It has manifest implications with regard to marriage, and specifically intermarriage, relations. By implication it is uncompromisingly antagonistic to intermar riage. Clearly this word, especially as a technical term, could not have been in use before the period when the question of inter marriage with and of the complete exclusion from the practice of the Jewish religion of the resident of Palestine who was himself either foreign-born or the offspring of an intermarriage was raised for the very first time in all Jewish history. The term must have been coined at just this time; and since, outside of this one pas sage, it is found elsewhere in the Hexateuch only in P, it must have been coined by one who was himself, not necessarily a P writer, but rather a forerunner of P. All this cumulative evidence points with certainty to the conclusion that Ezra himself must have been the author of the legislation in Lev. 23.40b, 42-43a, which modifies in such striking and significant manner the original H legislation for the Asif or Sukkot festival.230 Obviously too as a legislator Ezra must have stood midway between the Deuteronomic and the Priestly Codes. 130 This suggests too that it may well have been Ezra himself, or at least his associates and contemporaries, who likewise formally changed the old name of this festival, Asif, to the new name, Sukkot (cf. note 97). This change of name may have seemed fully justified by the drastic reformation of the manner of celebrating the festival, which Ezra instituted. And, of course, the constant and formal use of the new name would have tended to emphasize the new manner of celebration of the festival and further its acceptance in folk-practice. Manifestly in some respects Ezra was a clever and far-seeing reformer.</page><page sequence="143">[143] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 143 Viewed from one angle, his work and his legislation reverted, back beyond the Holiness Code, with its syncretistic and com promising spirit, to the aggressive and rigorous particularism of the Deuteronomic Code. In one very real and literal sense Ezra was undoubtedly a Deuteronomist. But viewed from another angle his work and his legislation paved the way for the legisla tion, the genealogical system and the ritualistic narratives of the Priestly Code, despite the somewhat modified particularism of the later document.231 From all this it is clear that the reorganization of the festivals, their dating and manner of celebration, which culminated in the replacement of Calendar II by Calendar III, began with Ezra himself and played an important role in the general program of particularism and the formulation of a supposedly purer Yah wism, uncontaminated by Canaanite or other foreign religious and cultural influences, which the pro-Babylonian party, led first by Ezra, then by Nehemiah and still later by Johanan, and closely affiliated with the Jewish community of Babylonia, sought to foster. In this program the gradual redating of the festivals by P legislators, coming after Ezra, and their consequent severance from their original basic connection with the significant moments of the agricultural year, with the resultant loss of primary agri cultural character and agricultural religious import, had a definite role. Seemingly these priestly reformers, like their predecessor, Ezra, had learned something from the experience of the Deuter onomic Reformation, viz., that the permanent reform of the cult could not be achieved by drastic and uncompromising legislation and compulsory abrogation of objectionable or questionable rites and institutions. Many of these were too deeply rooted in folk practice, and particularly in the folk-practice of those native Palestinians who had never gone into exile nor forsaken their own land, to be abrogated by mere legislation, no matter how intense the opposition to them on the part of the legislators. Only by a 231 Therefore we have suggested (above, p. 60) that vv. 42-43a, and with these, as we now see, v. 40b also, and probably with these Deut. 31.9-13 like wise, are the work of one closely related to RP rather than actually of RP himself, a forerunner of P, as it seems fit to call him.</page><page sequence="144">144 JULIAN MORGEN STERN [144] system of reinterpretation, modification and redating could the objectionable, non-Yahwistic, assimilative features of these cere monies and institutions be made to conform to the principles of true Yahwism, as formulated by these Priestly legislators, and so justify their no doubt half-hearted approval and sanction.232 Precisely this was the character of the reformation of the calen dar and of the manner of celebration of the festivals which these Priestly legislators and reformers sanctioned and which brought about the gradual evolution of Calendar III. But while the beginning of this process was with Ezra, it was, nevertheless, only the beginning and upon a comparatively modest, initial scale. With him was involved only the reorgani zation of the ritual of the Sukkot festival, and not yet a shifting of the date thereof.233 And while he did base his reform of the festival celebration upon certain new legislation, it was legisla tion inserted into and supplementing and reinterpreting the older Holiness Code, and not yet basically new legislation incorporated into an altogether new code, viz., P. The systematic evolution of Calendar III came actually only some time after Ezra, a generation or so, with the advent of Johanan to the high-priesthood and with this the complete tri umph of the pro-Babylonian, Sadokite-Aaronite, priestly party. Assured, as they now were, of the whole-hearted support and cooperation of the high-priest and of his entire family, and with the contest with the native levitical priests definitively settled in their favor, and the latter in general relegated to a position of inferior ministration and authority, the Sadokite-Aaronite priests could now venture upon reforms of more far-reaching compass and more systematic and radical character than they had dared aspire to up to this moment. Moreover, they were now the sole, authoritative custodians of the official Torah, and could therefore edit or add to it in whatever manner they wished; for clearly the principle had not yet been formulated that נ3נ This was, it is clear, to a certain extent the same policy as had actuated a century or more previously the authors of both H and Pt. But equally clearly here it was carried out much more rigidly and more decidedly in the direction of strict particularism. 33&lt;־ Cf.

The result was the so-called GrundschriftGrundschrift of the Priestly Code, followed very speedily by the very first modifications and amplifications thereof, viz., the begin nings of P2, and with this the earliest stages in the reorganization of the calendar and the emergence of Calendar III.234 There is no need to repeat here, other than in summary man ner and with reference to the historic setting, what has been adequately presented, even with some unavoidable repetition, earlier in this study. Suffice it to say that there can be little doubt that the first stages in the evolution of Calendar III, fol lowing upon Ezra's reform of the manner of celebration of the Sukkot festival, transpired during the early part of Johanan's long period of service as high-priest, i. e., presumably between 414 and 400 B.c. These first stages were the shift of the date of Rosh Hashanah from VII/10 to VII/1, of Sukkot, now under its new name, from VII/3-9 to VII/15-21, and of the Mazzot festival from the week, beginning with Sunday and ending with Saturday, in which the spring equinox fell, to the week extending from 1/15 through 1/21, with the Passover celebrated on the night of the fourteenth, immediately preceding the beginning of the Mazzot festival the next morning.235 In this way the exact moment of beginning the two great agricultural festivals, Mazzot and Suk kot, was shifted from Sunday, the first day of the respective festi val weeks, to the full moon days of the respective festival months. Also in this way the two festivals were made mutually recip rocal and celebrated with exactly six months intervals between them. This is, of course, the earliest stage of the evolution of JM These conclusions are self-evidently of utmost significance for the deter mination of the actual origin and history of the Priestly Code. They imply among other things that, contrary to prevailing scholarly opinion (cf. in par ticular E. Meyer, Die Entslehung des Judenthums, 199-234), Ezra did not have the so-called Grundschrift of P before him (cf. above, note 209), but that this came only a full generation or more after Ezra, and that this in turn was pre ceded by certain editing of the older codes, H and Pt and even D, in which process Ezra himself had an important and no doubt even a leading part. *&gt;s It is now clear that this shifting of the date of the Passover-Mazzot festival in Palestine took place not so very long after the same shifting of the date of the festival was introduced into Egypt in 419 B.c. (cf. above, p. 116).</page><page sequence="146">146 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [146] Calendar III, as depicted in the primary P2 sections of Lev. 23 and Num. 28-29. The next stages in the evolution of Calendar III must have come about during the latter portion of the high-priesthood of Johanan and that of his successor, Jaddua, i. e., approximately between 400 b.c. and 335 B.c., just prior to the beginning of the Greek period. These stages were the institution of Shemini Azeret upon VII/22 and of Yom Kippur upon VII/10, the old New Year's Day. Apparently, as we have suggested, these two festivals, altogether novel in character and import, were the result of concessions by the priestly authorities of the day to persistent folk-practice which they found themselves unable to eradicate. Quite a bit later than the institution of these two sacred days, and therefore no doubt at about or shortly after the beginning of the Greek period,236 came the change in the method of reckoning the day, from evening to evening instead of from morning to morning, as of old, with, of course, the con sequent redating of the festivals, so that the actual moments of their beginning might be set at eventide, instead of at dawn, as had been the practice up to this moment, and with this, in turn, the complete fusion of the Passover and Mazzot festivals under the ancient name Pesah, rooted in the true, desert, Yah weh-cult.237 2,6 Is it possible that some vague reminiscence of this significant reorganiza tion of the calendar is preserved in the statement of Alberuni (Chronology of Ancient Ancient Nations, tran. Sachau, 32 f.), "When Alexander had left Greece at the age of twenty-six years, ... he went down to Jerusalem, which was inhabited by the Jews; then he ordered the Jews to give up the era of Moses and David, and to use his era instead, and to adopt that very year, the twenty-seventh of his life, as the epoch of this era. The Jews obeyed his command, and ac cep'ted what he ordered; for the Rabbis allowed them such a change at the end of each millenium after Moses. And just at that time a millenium had become complete, and their offerings and sacrifices had ceased to be practised, as they relate. So they adopted his era, and used it for fixing all the occurrences of their months and days?" (I owe this reference and suggestion to the generous cooperation of my friend and colleague, Professor J. Z. Lauterbach.) 237 In this too these P2 legislators seem to have been treading again in the footsteps of their Deuteronomic predecessors who, it is plain, sought deliber ately to make the name and the idea of the Passover dominate those of the Mazzot festival in their coordination of the two festivals, undoubtedly because</page><page sequence="147">[147] THE CALENDARS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL 147 Still later, and obviously as an indispensable step in the process of formulating Calendar III as a perfect luni-solar cal endar, no doubt with the nineteen-year cycle of intercalation, came the first urge to designate the months, necessarily read justed as they were in this luni-solar calendar, by the Babylonian month names. Now the calendar year consisted formally of three hundred and fifty-four or three hundred and fifty-five days, with months of alternately twenty-nine and thirty days each, and with an extra month intercalated seven times in the course of the nineteen-year cycle. And apparently hand in hand with this went the attempt to shift the beginning of the official year from VII/1 to 1/1. But, as we have learned, this entire process was slow indeed and attended by stubborn resistance, undoubtedly largely of a sectarian character. As evidence thereof we may cite the persistent adherence of the Samaritans and Sadducees and the later Karaites and Falashas to the older dating of the Passover and their continued observance of "the day after the Sabbath,"238 the eventual rejection, despite its apparent acceptance in I Macc., of the transfer of the New Year's Day to 1/1, the hesi tant and inconsequent use of the Babylonian month names even in literature so late as I and II Macc., and especially the bitter diatribe against the luni-solar year and calendar and the ardent championship of the artificial solar year of three hundred and sixty-four days, with a consequently different and warmly advo cated dating of the festivals, in Jubilees 6.32-38. And as this literary evidence shows, this struggle persisted bitterly practically to the beginning of the first century B.C. Finally, in the first century of the Greek period, came the they realized that in origin the Passover was a pastoral, desert festival, integral in the primitive, pre-Canaanite, Yahweh-cult, while, in significant contrast, the Mazzot festival was of unmistakably Canaanite, agricultural character, in origin therefore associated with Canaanite Baal-worship. 238 It seems quite probable that the antipathy of the Samaritans to the institution of the second Passover, recorded in II Chron. 30.10 (cf. above, p. 102), was based primarily upon their fundamental objection to this final entire redating of the Passover and their purpose to hold fast to the dating of the festival basic to H; cf. also Johannes Jeremias, Die Passahfeier der Samaritaner, 75</page><page sequence="148">148 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [148] last stages in the evolution of Calendar III, the substitution of "the day after the Passover" for the older "day after the Sab bath" (of the Mazzot festival), and with this, though manifestly in the period following shortly after the close of the canon of the Torah, since no mention thereof occurs in the Pentateuch, the final fixing of the date of the Shabuot festival upon III/6, and the institution of "the second Passover." With this Calendar III had evolved practically into its complete and final form, despite the sectarian opposition to it, or to certain features of it, which, as we have just learned, persisted for another century or century and a half. The introduction into Calendar III of the Purim and Hanukkah festivals, regardless of what the actual origins and imports of these two festivals in ancient folk-practice may have been, during the second century B.c., was, of course, a simple, and from the standpoint of the calendar itself, an insignificant process. Such is the history of the transition from Calendar II to Calendar III and the record of the evolution of Calendar III. Note 212 (Continued) This conclusion may find additional confirmation in the assumption that the seven-year period of Bagoas' oppression of the Jews was terminated by the death of Darius II and the accession to the throne of of Artaxerxes II in 404 b. c., with the quite natural intruduction of a new foreign policy. This would then point to 411 b. c. as the year of Johanan's accession to the high priesthood.</page></plain_text>
