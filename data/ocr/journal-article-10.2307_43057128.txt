<plain_text><page sequence="1">Snezhana Dimitrova/Naum Kaytchev* Bulgarian nationalism, articulated by the textbooks in modern Bulgarian history 1878-1996 Abstract The article reviews, firstly ; the forms of nationalism conveyed by the textbooks in Bulgarian history since the establishment of the modern Bulgarian state in 1878, and, secondly, the complex multi-layer interplay between the national narration and the communist internationalist scheme . Although some en- croachments of civic nationalism - most notably in the 1993 post-communist textbook - could be discerned, the different brands of ethnic nationalism pre- vailed. During the first and the last decade of the communist rule, the national narration was intermingled with the prevailing internationalist dogma, whereas from mid-1950s till early 1980s historical materialism enjoyed monopoly on textbook pages . The expanding literature on South-East European nationalism has already pointed out the importance of school - along with the other state institutions, notably, the army - for forging national identity (Todorova 1995: 77). How- ever, in the Bulgarian case, the research is still short of penetrating the space in- side the school walls; the textbook analysis is still in its outset.1 This deficiency is all the more regrettable since school textbooks are the " modern equivalents of the former village story-tellers . Like fairy tales-tellers in non-literate societies, textbooks in history and geography are charged with the responsibility of conveying to youth what adults believe they should know about their own culture and foreign societies' ' (Berghahn and Schissler 1987: 141). In this particular academic context, our initial theoretical perspective starts from the thesis statement that: * There are, of course, many sources of so- cialization in modern society, but they cannot compare to textbooks in their ca- pacity to convey a uniform, approved, even official version of what youth should believer (Ibid.: 141) A similar perspective permits considering the his- tory textbook both as a "gospel in civic conduct" and a "fundamental mean" for shaping the national identity. In what follows we shall try to present con- cisely, firstly, the forms of nationalism conveyed by history textbooks since the establishment of the modern Bulgarian state in 1878, and, secondly, the com- plex multi-layer interplay between the national narration and the communist internationalist scheme. The object of our analysis is confined to the textbook Snezhana Dimitrova is author of the sections "Nikola Stanev: a history of the people's begin- nings"; "The 1946 progressive historians"; "The national issue and the internationalist identity" and "Decommunization of the national identity". Naum Kaytchev is author of the sections "Bul- garian history in the curricula" and "Pre-First World War textbooks". 1 Radeva 1986 could be cited as the first post-war attempt for regarding these problems.

Since this period in- cluded the most crucial and key problems of the "nation's destiny" like the "Macedonian question" or the two "national catastrophes", the nationalist messages were articulated more explicitly. Post- 1878 years were most contra- dictory in terms of both capitalist-communist and nationalist-internationalist oppositions; hence these textbook sections were most extensively re-written re- flecting the change of the socio-political mode. Our study starts with the shared thesis of the recent theories on nationalism claiming that nation and nationalism are modern-time phenomena. We accept that nationalism is both the product of and accelerating stimulus for the devel- opment of the modern entrepreneur industry and business administration, the nation providing the sole reliable basis and framework for their growth. How- ever, our discussion is not concerned whether the nation is perceived as a fact of history, that is, a "reality", or as an "ideological setting", "imagined commu- nity", created, or rather, painted, by a particular elite with certain political goals (Smith 1995; Dimitrova 1997: 352-353). What is important for our analysis is the form of conveyed nationalism, i. e. whether the textbooks prefer and in what modification the Herder ethnic (or cultural, or organic, or genetic) nationalism, proclaiming the supreme importance of the common language, origin, customs, rituals, traditions, religion, territory, or the French - Anglo- Saxon type of civic (or republican, or state) nationalism postulating the nation as a "body of citizens [regardless of their origin, language and religion] whose collective sovereignty constitutes the state". (Hobsbawm 1990: 4) Finally, if the concept of nationalism is to be defined in a phrase, it is the principle requiring that political and national entities should coincide (Gellner 1983: 1). Bulgarian history in the curricula Before examining the textbooks themselves, it would be appropriate to outline in brief the national history's role in the school system - the institutional and social context would permit us to grasp the textbooks' impact. Surprisingly for a young nation-state, until Balkan wars the Bulgarian history had modest rep- resentation in the school curricula: it was incorporated into a world history, the sole exception being the one year course in the seventh grade (Programa 1896: 856-861; Programa 1903: 21-22; Kaytchev 1997: 398). That accounted to three times more attention to universal history as compared to the national one. However, after 1912 some changes took place gradually. They culminated in 1927 - when the national history was included among the final exams' sub- jects - and 1929 - when it acquired a 3 hours per week full-year presence in the twelfth grade. (Programa 1920: 19-24; Programa (1) 1922: 53-59; Pro- grama (2) 1922: 53-65; Programa 1925: 56-67; Educational ministry's circu- lar letters, 6 Dec. 1927, 14 July 1928). From the late 1920s till the mid- 1940s, national history was endowed with unprecedented social functions as a separ- 52</page><page sequence="3">ate subject: three-year courses (in sixth, seventh and twelfth grades) apart, it was important at least twice in the young people's live: either to pass from in- termediate school into a gymnasium or to obtain a secondary education de- gree, one heavily depended on special examination in Bulgarian history (as one of the several special subjects). After the 1944 communist take-over, the new authorities preserved national history in the secondary school's curriculum. It was taught in the final one or two years. Moreover, Bulgarian history - along with Bulgarian literature - determined the future of a good share of the ambitious youth: examination in these two subjects was the dreamed entrance gate to the prestigious university disciplines - law, humanities, social sciences. Since the number of students in these courses was administratively curtailed by the state, the competition was especially strong; respectively the Bulgarian history - more precisely, its ver- sion shaped in the textbooks' mould - had immediate and direct impact on the individual's social role. In the post-communist period, national history was still preserved in the curricula, though since 1996 it is taught in one year only (in the last 11th grade). Pupils with special interest could choose it as an additional three- hours-per-week option. University entrance exams are still in Bulgarian history and literature, yet since both the student numbers are no longer state-regulated and universities multiplied around the country, the competition is not so strong; hence the subject has lost a portion of its social function. 1. Pre-First World War Textbooks (1878-1914) During the first three decades of independent statehood, all textbooks in Bul- garian history extensively elaborated on the medieval and pre- 1878 periods. The latest events, presented on a few pages only, were rather a contemporary appendix to the main narration than a part of the real, great history (Bobchev 1881: 275-296; Bobchev 1897: 197-210; Bobchev 1899: 170-197. Ganchev 1888: 107-112; Ganchev 1892: 99-103; Ganchev 1899: 101-104; Neychev 1900: 163-168; Neychev 1905: 176-181; Georgiev 1914: 167-175).2 Fur- thermore, the authors preferred to discuss in detail not the modern Bulgarian state but the Eastern Crisis of 1875-78 which produced it. Both teachers and students did not focus their attention on the post- 1878 years. What is more surprising, these pages did not resemble the passionate nationalist press rhetoric of the time. The emotional patriotic implications were a rarity - a concise factual account was offered instead. Authors preferred to convey the mere events, not to comment them. The nation-making, then at its apogee, simply did not need any additional explicit support from the textbook pages: since those relatively few pupils who reached the seventh or higher grades sprung from the town-oriented classes they were destined to deviate 2 The whole section is based on the analysis of these textbooks' chapters. Only specific cases of dif- ference and quotations will be given. 53</page><page sequence="4">from the traditional folk mentality and to embrace the dominant ideological expression of modernity - the nationalism. True, by the turn of the century some alternative modern ideologies - socialism, anarchism, agrarianism - began to challenge the monopoly of patriotism, yet these were still more an in- tellectual novelty rather than serious political or social threat to the system. Hence the emerging ruling elite did not pay any special attention to them and did not overtake any thorough institutional school measures. As one of the most thoughtful observers (Ivan Ormandzhiev, an interwar author of history textbooks) noticed: "San-Stefano Bulgaria [i. e., the unified Greater Bulgaria] remained an ideal for the liberated Bulgarians . The schools, however ; were not dominated by the pre-planned programme and work in service of that ideal [Ormandziev's holding]. The will of the teacher determined what he would do with his subject for the good education of the students . Under these conditions , the majority of history teachers did not consider the pragmatic teaching as necessary ; all the more so since no one spoke on it then - and it was not necessary to speak for the mere environment of the school institutions bore and served the unification ideal " (Ormandzhiev 1938: 652). Nonetheless, though concise and strictly informative, the textbook accounts of the contemporary national history offered a rationale for Bulgarian nationalism. Firstly, they related in length the decisions of both the 1876 Con- stantinople conference and the 1878 San-Stefano Treaty prescribing an estab- lishment of an autonomous and large Bulgarian state(s) embracing the vast Bulgarian-populated region coinciding with the sum of the three ancient prov- inces of Moesia, Thrace and Macedonia. The San-Stefano agreement of 3 March 1878 was especially glorified on the grounds that it liberated and estab- lished the new state (the date was - and presently, after forty-five-year commu- nist interruption, again is - a national holiday). The two notions were empha- sised: the ethnic justice of the San-Stefano borders and their legal affirmation because of the inauguration connected with international diplomacy. Thus the authors reconfirmed the ethnic, cultural nature of the Bulgarian nationalism. Secondly, the textbooks did not fail to describe the provisions of the Berlin treaty, which divided this "true, proper Bulgaria" into five pieces: Bulgarian Principality, Eastern Rumelia - an autonomous region under the Ottoman sul- tan, Macedonia, western districts under Serbia, North Dobrudzha under Ro- mania. . . Thus an indignation against the "unfair" situation was implied. Al- though in general the style was non-emotional and objective, sometimes powerful metaphors were risen to instil patriotic passions. For example, the Berlin treaty was labelled as "a knife, which cut up the Fatherland into pieces " (Bobchev 1881: 289). Emphasising the imagined "San-Stefano country" rather than the current Principality, the authors neglected the nurturing of the "state-nation" and preferred to favour the traditional cultural nation. Once "San-Stefano ideal" being created, it was omitted from the pages con- cerning the post- 1878 Principality. What was offered was a concise account of internal political developments as well as of the two 1885 events: eastern 54</page><page sequence="5">Rumelia - Principality unification and Serb-Bulgarian war. This left some rea- sons for an eventual state-based nationalism. Nonetheless, the textbooks still provided an advantage for the established ethnic nationalism. Although they did not discuss the fate of Bulgarians outside the Principality (in Macedonia, western districts or Dobrudzha) they elaborated on the will of ethnic Bulgar- ians from North (i.e. of Principality) and South (i.e. of Eastern Rumelia) to live in one country. Secondly, the account was short of describing the economic, social and cultural progress of the independent country; instead, the political narration was preferred. Finally, but most importantly, both the space and the emotions on San-Stefano-Berlin decisions exceeded those devoted to the real existing state. The contemporary Bulgarian history supposed an extensive dealing with the Great Powers' influence: no major act was accomplished without their decisive involvement. Hence, they were often key actors on textbooks pages where their attitude towards the Bulgarian national desiderata became a cri- terion of their fairness/ unfairness. In addition, they could play the interrelated role of promoters of progress and civilization. It is hardly a surprise that if some permanent characteristic should be outlined, it is their equivocal appearing. The only exception was Russia's presentation in the first 1881 edition of the Bobchev's textbook. The great Slav empire always emerged as the great bene- factor of the southern brothers: it supported Bulgarian claims on an inter- national diplomatic arena, its provisional war-time administration, in fact, es- tablished the structures of the Bulgarian state. The cool political reasons for the 1877-78 Russian-Turkish war were omitted - an emotional, moral image was portrayed instead: " Bulgarians and their sufferings were more than close to the Russian heart. . .All Russia was deeply moved and gave soldiers, money and aid to the great war with a sacred and selfless aim: the liberation " (Ibid.: 286). More importantly, it came to symbolise the fair San-Stefano treaty while western powers were blamed with the Berlin "injustice". However, since the Bulgarian-Russian relations gradually deteriorated after 1883, the later textbooks played down the exclusive all-embracing benefaction. Either the Bulgarian misfortunes in Berlin were presented as a product of the objective political interests of all powers, Russia included, or simply the Peters- burg's unamiable attitude (during the 1885 unification or 1886 prince Alex- ander of Bulgaria's disposition) was mentioned. Thus even the initially most friendly power, "the Liberator", came to be an ambiguous factor in the Bulgar- ian strive towards national happiness. The other Great Powers were also presented in equivocal tones. Europeans could be a symbol of progress - as they were in 1876, responding to the "Bul- garian horrors" with the Constantinople conference. In the same time, their selfish cunning policy could bring much injustice, as it happened at Berlin. The countries usually were not described individually, they tended to be " European powers" or simply " Europeans ". Only two states were mentioned by name: England and Austria. Both played a crucial role in the dismemberment of San- Stefano Bulgaria; the latter, in addition, encouraged the 1885 Serbian aggres- 55</page><page sequence="6">sion and afterwards stopped the triumphant Bulgarian forces depriving them from the deserved reward. Nonetheless, the negative connotations of the indi- vidual cases did not dominate the texts: the western powers emerged as an evasive but crucial players in recent events; since they had displayed changing attitudes towards "Bulgarian righteous national needs", their future behaviour should be all the more unpredictable. Apart from the Great Powers, the Balkan states were the other important ex- ternal factor in contemporary Bulgarian history. The textbooks did not pay equal attention to them. Romania was mentioned only in connection with her 1878 Berlin seizure of North Dobrudzha; afterwards, neither Dobrudzha nor the northern neighbour were renoticed. Greece was entirely absent - and this despite the fact that when the textbooks were used, it was engaged in a bitter ri- valry with Bulgaria in Ottoman-controlled Macedonia. The old Ottoman em- pire appeared only as a retrograde force trying to keep its hold over subjected Bulgarians, while it virtually disappeared from the stories after 1878. Only one textbook described the post- 1878 empire as an independent actor. Ganchev's 1888 and 1892 editions, reflecting to some extent the Sofia-Constantinople dé- tente of the time, described the Turkish wise and sober, peaceful reaction to the 1885 Bulgarian unification - in sharp contrast with the Serb warmonger aggres- siveness. However, in the third 1899 edition, the Turkish moderateness turned out to be dictated not by Porte's wisdom but by its fear from the quickly prog- ressing Bulgarian army (Ganchev 1888: 110; 2 ed. 1892: 101; 3 ed. 1899: 103). Thus the most commented neighbour was the western one, Serbia. In the 1881 textbook, it appeared as an eloquent power - its 1876 war with Turkey proved it as both a helpful ally and an disloyal, selfish partner (Bobchev 1881: 278-279). Later, the 1885 Serb-Bulgarian war introduced Serbia as a central factor in Bulgaria's state affirmation on the political map. Initially, either " the king Milan " or "the government" were blamed for the ruthless aggression, thus leaving a touch of supposition that the real Serbia was quite more friendly (Ganchev 1892: 101; 3 ed. 1899: 103-104). Later editions, however, began to use the general label of the "Serbs" which implied the unequivocal negative as- sociation (Neychev 1900: 167; 3 ed. 1905: 180). On the whole, Serbia, like all other neighbours, was not evoked purposefully on textbook pages, with the special task of demonizing "the other" in order to forge one's own identity. No- netheless, some events such as the 1885 war inevitably executed such functions to a certain extent. In a similar manner, all textbooks until 1912 did not emphasise the contem- porary Bulgarian history neither elaborated extensively on the nationalist nar- rative. However, towards the eve of the war, some changes were bound to take place - the 1914 textbook marked some shifts in the narration line. The post- 1878 period was still a several-page appendix to the main story, reproducing the same characteristics of the Great Powers. Nonetheless, the negative image of Serbia was further reinforced. The 1876 war was presented as a humiliating 56</page><page sequence="7">disaster demonstrating Serbian weakness as well as Russian and Bulgarian vir- tues: "A Bulgarian-Russian detachment distinguished itself in a number of battles , notably at D huras, where the Serbs were put to flight leaving Bulgar- ians and Russians to uphold the strong Turkish pressure. The Serbs continued to loose and Serbia would eventually be turned into a desert if the Russian king did not threaten and force the sultan to stop the war and make a peace with the Serbs and Montenegrins ." (Georgiev 1914: 168). Accordingly, the Serb-Bulgarian war was portrayed as a vicious deed of the whole people, " the Serbs", while the name of the previously blamed king Milan was not mentioned at all. More importantly, the modern Bulgarian state was presented in a revised manner. The relevant three-page section ignored not only the economical, cul- tural and social developments but omitted the internal politics, too. The party squabbles and cabinet changes were neglected in order to demonstrate the unity under the king's leadership: no person was mentioned by name save the Bulgarian monarchs of the time, Alexander and Ferdinand. Thus the narration was constructed in line with the national foreign policy doctrine: correcting the Berlin injustice and achieving "the unification of the Bulgarian people". Both the 1885 unification and the Serb-Bulgarian war were presented as steps in this direction. The narration on the post- 1887 period focused pupils' attention on a southern terra irredenta - the Ottoman governed Macedonia - where Bulgar- ians' drive for freedom was persistently thwarted by the joint efforts of the Turks, Greeks and Serbs. The other foreign ruled parts of the San-Stefano body, western districts and Dobrudzha, were not discussed explicitly. The story ended with the 1908 proclamation of the Bulgarian independence, which was described as a preparation for "the liberation of the enslaved brethren" (Geor- giev 1914: 171-174). To sum up, though space-restricted and concise, the con- temporary history account was re-written in line with the requirements of the ethnic nationalism. This tendency was to grow further pace in the interwar years. 2. Nikola Stanev: a history of the people's beginnings. . . (1917-1944)3 Various reasons impelled us to focus this chapter on Nikola Stanev's writings. He was the author of the first textbook in Bulgarian history written in war time (1917). On commission of the Bulgarian General Stuff he also wrote a history book for the Bulgarian soldiers (1917). Afterwards, Stanev wrote and pub- lished several history textbooks as well as a history teacher's handbook. Per- sonally, he was a teacher of long standing and a principal of a Sofia gym- 3 The following sections are also a part of a sociological research on the topic, "Rewritings of the modern Bulgarian history in gymnasium textbooks". The research - commissioned by the Bulga- rian Ministry of Education and funded by the International Foundation for Minority Problems and Cultural Interactions - was conducted by the Center for Analysis and Social Studies. 57</page><page sequence="8">nasium. Finally, the effect of his writings is vivid even nowadays. In various contemporary autobiographical interviews and memoirs, the most mentioned textbook author is Nikola Stanev; in this respect, indicative is the fact that in 1989, the Bulgarian Emigration Centre in Toronto chose to publish precisely Stanev's History (1943) with the following motto: "The current history has been copied to serve the needs of Bulgarians abroad, without communist- biased changes , without comments , remakes and falsifications . Bulgarian ex- iles However, by far the most important argument in his favour was that Sta- nev's version dominated the Bulgarian school at that time: all the inter-war textbooks (that were licensed by the Educational Ministry) were shaped in a similar mould (Stanev 1917; Stanev and Stoianov 1922; Stanev 1925; Popov and Grancharov 1925; Pastuhov and Stoianov 1926; Petleshkov 1926; Pastu- hov i Stoianov 1928; Pastuhov i Stoianov 1929; Grancharov i Popov 1932; Kepov i Kepova 1937; Georgiev i Dimitrov 1937; Popov i Grancharov 1939; Kepov i Kepova 1940; Dokladní zapiski za bibliotéka "Drevna Bulgaria"; Or- mandzhiev i Velkova 1941; Ormandzhiev 1943; Stanev 1943). On the other hand, the non-variant national programme as well as the political public con- sensus on it implied only the historical narration legitimising "the unity of the nation". This precluded any divergence or tension between the state's "covert educational programme" and the one of Stanev. The former was a programme for civic behaviour and national upbringing whereas the latter built the identity of a Bulgarian citizen and a Bulgarian patriot. The national narration (reconstructed through an analysis of Nikola Sta- nev's textbook in Bulgarian history) was a narration on the emancipation of the Bulgarian people, which was perceived as a national whole, different from the outside surrounding world; an emotional account of the Bulgarian people's Golgotha and its resurrection. The genius of the Bulgarian people and its realization were the structural centre of the mosaics of the historical narration. The spirit of the national ideas and yearnings as well as their consummation were the core of the national nar- ration. The story was more of a reference legitimising the rights for the national unification within "the natural borders" rather than history - the problem of Moesia, Macedonia, Thrace: " Natural and fair is the state enlargement that is based precisely on the idea of the national unification. The place where the substantial people's portion is left under foreign rule should point the direction of the country's development in order to assemble all its compatriots under the single cultural and state-cre- ating organization" ( Stanev 1943: 295). The Stanev's chain of events was determined by the Bulgarian nation's cre- ation as well as by the stages of nation's realization thought as an effort to bring together scattered ethnic elements in a united sovereign state body. The con- tent of these stages resembled those of the individual's development: "birth", strengthening, and "heyday of the creative powers"; furthermore, is was orga- 58</page><page sequence="9">nised around the same moral hierarchy dominated by the ideas of "happiness" and "progress". Happiness and progress - borrowed from the individual life and trans- formed as a collective's aim - entailed the anthropomorphic character of the historical process implying the same strictly determined anthropomorphic par- ameters for its ultimate accomplishment. This ideal, in Stanev's wording, could be achieved "when no part of the people will be hurt , when all the parts will be gathered in a single whole, will benefit from the natural rights and freedoms, which, after colossal struggles and sufferings the humanity has gained and as- sumed as basic and irreversible" (Stanev 1943: 294, holding ours). The forming of the nation was presented as an emanation of the high human values, as an ultimate justice, crowning the people's movement to hap- piness; it was a criterion for historical emancipation of a given people and for its joining the humanity. This form of the collective's existence could both real- ize "the right of the people " to " happiness and justice " (imagined solely as a national unification in "its natural borders"), and contribute to the European political-cultural world - a world thought of as a community of the advanced nations (Frenchmen, Germans, Italians) which had built their states on the "nationality principle ". This principle guaranteed the very existence of "the humanity" under "the real historical condition", where nation and nationality were "the foundations of the cultural life and advancement" (Enev 1938: 606). Thus the future of "humanity", understood as a realised happiness and at- tained progress, was a function of the nations' dreams, aspirations, and yearn- ings oriented mainly towards "the incorporation of the brothers left outside the borders of the nation-state". Hence, Stanev's value system - with the ideal of national unification at the top - naturally postulated the historical process' thelos and served as a key cri- terion in the historical narration. The past, future and present were filtered only through this ideological construction. Stanev followed the rules of history's public space which accepted only the historical interpretations of "the life of the collective *, and its development, " which was precisely the history conceived as a process It was claimed on the pages of the official Educational Ministry's magazine that : ''The historical life always had started only after the collective has been formed as something whole and had began to live a common life . Therefore, the element of the history is the nation, not the individuar (Enev 1938: 611; cf. Ormandzhiev 1938; Lambrev 1938; Popov 1936; Ishirkov 1929; Zografov 1936). The measure of Stanev's historical narration embodied two parts. Firstly, the layer of the ideological and political context of the time "here and now"; the interwar period was dominated by the nationalistic ideology and the con- cept of the national space as the sole possibility for the realization of the indi- vidual in the modern world. Secondly, the layer of science "history", an out- look stressing the linear time and the progress as a historical process' line of de- velopment. Hence the account was structured around two teleological centres: "The progress - compulsory for the humanity" and "humanity's progress - 59</page><page sequence="10">possible solely as a separate people's progress, which is feasible only under its national unification". In other words, humanity's advancement was possible only after the accomplishment of the dreamed equilibrium: the state = the fa- therland = the people = the nation. Every actor or event contributing to this equilibrium, (or, that is, to the Bul- garian people's emancipation) was "fair", whereas every "hindrance" received a strong negative connotation: 1. The Berlin Congress (1878) was an injustice. 2. The Russian-Turkish "Liberating" War (1877-1878) was glorified as well as the First Balkan one (1912-1913) while the Second Balkan War (1913) was classified as a hazard venture 3. The First World War's outcome was disastrous for the Bulgarian national programme, yet by accenting on the war as " an act of the nation " that pursued its most intimate ideal, "the unification ", war was presented as a logical and grandiose event, implying a rather positive readers' attitude. 4. The Paris Peace Treaty (1919) and its European makers were painted in dark colours. 5. The story on people's sufferings, on national Gol- gotha, logically ended with "the Bulgarian resurrection ", Easter 1941 (i.e. ac- quisition of large Macedonian and Thrace territories hitherto governed by Yu- goslavia and Greece; establishment of a larger state resembling San-Stefano Bulgaria). Thus Stanev's history conveyed a brand of powerful ethnic nationalism. It was a narration on the people's beginnings, on the people's realization of these beginnings, "discovering the self through the self and in the self' in the linear time of the progress, i.e. it was an "identity discourse" (Furet 1994: 24; Rüsen 1993: 5)4. It was basically "a non-notion story, compiled from the heart revel- ations , marked by the actors' divine souls " (Furet 1994: 24). This type of dis- course entailed a thinning of the layer of the science "history" regardless of Stanev's ostentatious declaration (both in the textbook's preface and in the sep- arately edited history teacher's handbook) vowing to adhere "the objective his- torical truth". This layer could be discovered not only in the author's philos- ophy of history (the positivism) but also in the documented basis of the nar- ration: international treaties, parliamentary speeches and debates, memories. . . Stanev's history was a paradox in other terms, too. The modernity entailed histories legitimising the economical and political emancipation of the third class, its thirst for both economic rise and power. The " modern History of Bul- garia" was not of this kind. Its measure was neither the mere power, nor some definite "class", but "the people". The narration elaborated on the capabilities of the people to realize "the national yearnings", not on the legitimating strat- egies of "the governments". It favoured only the political behaviour that could bring to a successful end "the people's ideals" and "the national pro- 4 We use here the notion of "identity discourse": 1. in the sense employed by Furet, that is, "a dis- course of the beginnings. . (Furet 1994: 16) and 2. in the sense employed by Rüsen, that is, "a historical narrative serves to establish the identity of its authors and listeners. This function deci- des whether a concept of continuity is plausible or not. This concept of continuity must be capa- ble of convincing listeners of the permanence and stability of themselves in the temporal change of their world and of themselves." (Rüsen 1993: 5) 60</page><page sequence="11">gramme"... Hence, the narration melted the individual dimension into the group's historical identity, excluded the genre of personal profile, ignored the biographical discourse. (Stanev 1927: 13) A closed circle could be outlined. There was insufficient distance between the subjective experience and the historical account; the narration was not emancipated as a science - it was dominated by the doxa instead. Memory was turned into a "historical truth" and collective emotions into the norm of "his- torical truth". They acquired the status of "objective reality", constructed from the position of "the objective truth". To sum up, the equivalence of Stanev's narrative with the official historical discourse as well as the application of col- lective memories formed the basic layer of the historical identity, maintaining it as a strong and persistent identification marker. In these circumstances, only one dissenting version remained - the histori- cal narration of the socialists. It was marginalized to a great extent: excluded from the official educational programmes, from the prevailing doxa, from the normalising political discourse. Since the public space of the history was domi- nated by the identity-mode narration, the account based on the opposite, so- ciological interpretation mode, was destined to be at the periphery; every at- tempt to explain the past with "categories" or "concepts" was marginalized. The history of one people, "born in ashes, without capital, without institutions, without knowledge or skills" (Stanev 1943: 521), that has endured "pains and sufferings", has realised its modernising advancement, has emancipated itself from the surrounding world "without hate or loathing" (Ibid.) in order to see its Easter in April 1941, relegated the socialists' historical discourse to a marginal status: firstly, as a content, and secondly, as a methodology. Stanev's narration greatly influenced the internar generations both as a form of expression and as basic layer of the historical identity: this claim will be proved by analysis of the first textbook of the communist Bulgaria. 3. "The 1946 progressive historians": the work of the historical unconscious 1946 witnessed the first attempt for rewriting the history, for legitimating the former marginals as "winners", for providing the new authorities with the required ideological resource. This history related the political story of "the narrow socialists", who sought the solving of the national problem in the cre- ation of the Balkan federal republic, built upon the "class principle" of "the in- ternationalism" (and not on "the right of the nation"). The past - regarded as a scene of multiple possibilities, with a narrow socialists' possibility left unreal- ised -was seen as a reservoir of positive perspectives for the future, for "the good and the progress of the people". Hence the unrealised past (the narration on the socialists) functioned as a proof for "the only right position" that could bring about "the good of the people", and served as a measure for justice (from the viewpoint of "the interests of the people"). "The unrealised past" in social- 61</page><page sequence="12">ist discourse (Kabakchiev 1915; Kabakchiev 1919) gradually began to swallow up "the realized past" in order to downgrade it as an ideological resource of the defeated groups who still contended for power. The 1946 textbook (Bozhikov et al. 1946) was the first step in this direc- tion. The first, because it was still far from the communist narration where the measure of the historical development would be "the class" and "its realiz- ation". The 1946 narration was a narration on the emancipation of "the people" defined as "a sum of progressive elements The norm of progressive- ness was "the possibility to realize the people's interests", whose content was changing in accordance with the linear movement of the historical time; finally, "the people's interests" would be tantamount to "the working class' interests". This norm embodied both the still uneradicated layer of the previous nar- ration's philosophy of history (the linear concept of the human progress, realising "the people's happiness") and the new interpretation scheme of the formation approach (Marxism-Leninism - the Revolution's ideology). This norm incorpor- ated from the political public debate the new thelos of history - the victory of "the progressive forces" over "the reaction". These "progressive forces" in dif- ferent historical periods could realize "particular people's interests". Thus the narration on the 1878-1894 historical period, when "the people's interests" were understood as an emancipation of the Bulgarian nation from the geopolitical space of the Ottoman empire and legitimisation the rights to a "national unification", was commensurate with the Stanev's narration in terms of both semantics and emphasised events in the chronological chain. The para- graph itself was called: "The affirmation of [Bulgarian] independent national existence" (Bozhikov et al. 1946: 272); the key events, respectively, "the Berlin Congress", "the Unification", "the Serb-Bulgarian war" - bore the historical identity initially set by N. Stanev. The Berlin Congress was characterised as un- fair because it partitioned the people, while the later two events were "fair", for they contributed to the national unification. The parallel existence of the elements of the former marginals, the narration on the struggle of the Bulgarian people against the military-monarchic-cAorô- adziV s dictatorship (Bozhikov et al. 1946: 289) and of the hitherto official his- torians, the story on "the struggle of the Bulgarian people for national indepen- dence of Bulgaria from 1878 to 1894" (Stanev 1943: 273) was reconciled by the historical-materialist interpretation scheme: in some historical periods, the bourgeoisie could be "a progressive force". According to the same interpretation logic, the national narration could slip out of the textbook's chapters covering the period when the progress was identified with the internationalism, and "the reaction" - with the bourgeoisie. In the 1946 version, this was the period of the Balkan wars and the ensuing " new period in the history of the Bulgarian people - period of wars and national catastrophes (1912- 1944/' (Bozhikov et al. 1946: 336). The negative assessment was expressed, firstly, by (re)naming the wars as "aggressive" and "catastrophic" which implied the mark of "the reac- tion" and, secondly, by the narration's division into two parallel occurring events. Two different-type actors were involved: the nation , the jointly acting 62</page><page sequence="13">collective body, constituted and developed upon the matrix of "rightful inter- ests" and "due values and claims", and the authorities , which, being unable to attain the assigned "claims" and to realize the "people's will", muted into "reac- tion". The emphasis on the chasm between the people and the ruling circles was unequivocally stressed when the Balkan War was related, to reach its final ac- complishment in the First World War chapter. Compare : 1 During "the Balkan war people were seized by a sparkling enthusiasm , they honestly believed they were going to fight for the liberation of their own brothers. The war had become very popular at that moment (Ibid.: 1946: 363); and 2. During uthe First World War[...] that type of mobilisation barely resembled the 1912 atmosphere . No enthusiasm this time , everyone could see the direction was wrong " (Ibid.: 375). Thus the first event (the Balkan War) alienated the actors, "the nation" and "the ruling class and the dynasty", in terms of their respective goals ("liber- ation" versus "conquest") but reconciled them as to the final outcome, " doing away with the feudal remnants in European Turkey " (Ibid.: 363) whereas the second event (the First World War, also the Second Balkan War) opposed the two sides completely and irreversibly (Ibid.: 364-378). From this standpoint, the First Balkan War had a progressive, liberating essence (Ibid.: 363) whereas the other two wars brought the people to a "complete national disaster " (Ibid.: 370-379). While the first war retained the positive layer by equating Bozhi- kov's story with Stanev's one (at the level of the event description), the two later wars were negatively charged, for Stanev's national narration was abandoned. Both rewritings were grounded in the Marxist scheme and its two-fold attitude towards the war: firstly, within the context of the antithesis "feudalism-capital- ism", "the young bourgeois states have waged a war against a semi- feudal Tur- key ", (Ibid.: 363), and secondly, within the relation "a class against a class", "farmers /agrarians, narrow socialists and regular socialists against the agents of the German imperialist policy" (Ibid.: 379.). Thus the 1946 textbook was puri- fied through the sieve of various theories; the national narration gradually evap- orated to provide space for the new international historical discourse. 4. The national issue and the international identity: 1946-1990 From the chapter on World War I onward, the 1946 narration more unequivo- cally abandoned the national identity concept in order to create the inter- national one; the internationally-based account eclipsed the national narration. The text structured the story in line with the new thelos - "the victory of 'prog- ress' over the 'reaction', (perceived as a victory of the ' new world of the Bulgar- ian People's Republic, of the inviolable union of workers, farmers and the hon- est intelligentsia 9 over the 'dynasty' as well as over the 'bourgeoisie' (Bozhikov et al. 1946: 433-434). The national entity gloomily sensed of 'dooming' - 'death' - 'impending catastrophe', while the 'salvation' could come only from the international progressive forces. That compositional setting displayed the contradiction national - international: on the one hand, it re-emphasised the story on the past through the categories of the national catastrophe ; on the 63</page><page sequence="14">other hand, the same composition created the powerful image of the potential 1944 third national catastrophe; 'the Bulgarian resurrection' of Stanev's national narration turned to be a national disaster. Thus: "Removed from both Russia and Serbia, and later on Yugoslavia, we turned out to be a mere tool in the hand of the Kaiser and Hitler imperialism. Our country underwent two national catastrophes: one in 1913, the other in 1918. Out of the third catastrophe, the most fearful one, which would erase us from the map of Europe, we were rescued by the Soviet Union and the Fatherland Front National Movement. The great act on September 9th, 1944, salvaged our country in the last moment. The new path which Bulgaria took on - the path of people's welfare, Slavic brotherhood and unification - is a path, traced by our history, by our historical development. Each deviation from this path leads to national calamity" (Ibid.: 434). This paragraph ended the story in chronological terms; more importantly, however, in line with the internal narrative logic, it served an expected step to the ultimate historical thelos. History, it seemed, was able to self-actualise, bringing about the victory of "progress over the resistance ", a victory which opened up " the road of the nation's welfare " (Ibid.: 434). On the other hand, let us repeat once again, the official pre- 1944 narration had forged a relatively staunch layer of identification, which is easily discerned on those 1946 text- book sections (generally on the pre- 1914 period), which were free from the pressure of the actual political publicity. In the early 1950s, the Ministry of Education commissioned three leading history "scientist" to write the new textbook in Bulgarian history. Its content apart, the book manifested another radical novelty - in terms of authorship. Hitherto, textbook writing was a preserve of secondary school teachers; even the 1946 version was written by men who were (or until very recently were) school teachers. From the mid-1950s on, all textbooks would be written by professionals who could be formally titled as "men of academia". In 1955, the book was printed under the ostentatious head of "the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Institute for Bulgarian History", and applied in the school. The scheme of the post- 1914 chapters of the previous textbook was further reinforced and extended; the entire modern period was structured according to the international Marxist postulates. In fact, this was a story on the historical formations, on the different class struggles and especially that of the vanguard of the working class - the Bulgarian Communist Party (including its early "narrow socialist" period). It would not be unfair to claim that the new book completely reduced the national narration to the basics of historical material- ism and the party line (Burmov et al. 1955).This scheme, and the textbook itself, enjoyed monopoly in the Bulgarian schools for nearly three decades. It was substantially revised as late as 1982. The communist interpretation schemes still had a preponderant role in the new "reformist" textbook (Dimitrov, Isusov and Shopov 1982); nevertheless, one could trace the beginnings of the re-differentiation of the national topic as an autonomous identification resource. Three narrations with their own differ- 64</page><page sequence="15">entiated structures and logic constructions could be discerned: the one based on historical materialism, the one based on party ideology, and the national narration. On the one hand, the historical materialist narration frequently referred to the notion of "Bulgarian society" designed as a framework of social relation- ships. On the other hand, the national narration made an extensive use of the symbol of "land" : liberation of lands and unification with the lands forcefully taken away from Bulgaria; herein a "land" did not imply territory but ethnos; Bulgarian lands were defined as predominantly Bulgarian-populated ones; Bulgaria was deprived from its lands by the Great Powers. The two narrations intercepted in certain points. " But alongside those processes ('the entrepreneurial development) the national and social problems of the Bulgarian society acquired unprecedented intensity" (Dimitrov, Isusov and Shopov 1982: 59) Or:: "the growth of capital- ist industry [. . .] precipitated the conflict with the Ottoman ruler who possessed territories which had belonged, since ancient times, to the national market of the free Balkan countries" (Ibid.:75). Yet, the historical-materialism narration played the crucial role as a major cause; for example, neither the accumulated ethnic strains, nor the people's in- dignation, nor a certain tradition, cultural or educational one, but precisely "the growth of capitalism", "the national markets" and so on aggravated the conflict with the "Ottoman ruler". The West's ambivalent image was rooted in the initial authors' concept de- fining it as a "savage capitalism" plus "modernity". Modernity and modern- isation came from the West (not from Russia). The emphasis was placed on the events following from the objective laws governing the society's development - an approach typical for the historical-materialistic narrative. The modern- isation ideologies were upgraded in the same narrative; the development of modernity was connected with undoubtedly capitalistic phenomena such as the initial capital accumulation, the bankruptcy of small owners, the aggravation of class conflicts. Meanwhile, whenever the emphasis had been laid upon the spe- cific, distinct moments, they tended to evolve within the context of the national narration. The historical-materialistic narration told the History of Bulgaria, embodied the collision between backwardness and progress, the affiliation with world-wide processes and regularities. The national narration told the history of Bulgaria, its tragic destiny, the story of its loss, of the calamities and failures, of all those conquered. The historical materialist narration implied historical optimism whereas the national narration posed the question "who is to be blamed?". On the third side, the happy end was a certified patent of the party- ideological story. 5. "Decommunisation" of the national identity: 1993 and after In reference to the programme for national identity, the authorised post-com- munist textbook (Bakalov et al. 1993) was enmeshed into a double symbol co- 65</page><page sequence="16">ercion. On the one hand, a novel geopolitical perspective was set up; the sym- bol scheme of identification with "Europe" prevailed, a scheme which empha- sised the "universal" rather than the national citizenship identification. Inas- much as the official historical discourse was linked to the current geopolitical visions of certain politicians, it is proved to be (like analogous situations of a major turn in modern history, determined by world-wide, not national, events) a relatively reflexive transmitter of those visions. Nearing the end of the 20th century, the world culture faces the problem of globalization. The urgency of this issue did not have analogy cases so far. It de- termines the efforts toward creating a new concept of culture envisaging that universal human values and the united Europe ideals are not contradictory to the national identity (Ukazanie 1992). On the other hand, the textbook authors were faced with the requirement for the internal decommunisation of the 1982 reformist narration. It was to be expected that the process of decommunisation - firstly , a liberation from the "history of abstraction", that is, from the historical-materialistic conceptual scheme, and, secondly, the fact renewal, "analysis of data hitherto concealed" - would have more far-reaching consequences regarding the "national unifi- cation" narration as compared with the rest of the textbook readings. The post-communist narration's accents could be derived from the section on the Berlin Congress, the foundation-laying event functioning as a pillar de- fining the national identity. The first layer of the assessment was a shared locus of memory for all textbook narrations: mutilation of the "proper" national space framed by the San-Stefano Treaty. The normative horizon where the authors moved during the assessment process, consisted of "historical justice" and "ethnic realities" which were juxtaposed to the "interests of the West Euro- pean Powers". The second layer of assessment was a novelty: the post-commu- nist historians elaborated on "some positive aspects of the Berlin Treaty ", thus distancing themselves from the tradition of painting the event solely as a "drama" or a "tragedy". These "positive aspects " were connected with the European geopolitical cartography {"the new retreat of the Ottoman empire from the European South-Easť ) which had substituted the historical-material- ist formation scheme, and the state organisation - "the independence of three separate states had been officially recognised, the Bulgarian state tradition ob- tained an opportunity for recovery . . ." (Bakalov et al. 1993: 474). Thus in the very beginning, in the starting point of the narration on the modern Bulgarian state, the nationality principle as a sole co-ordinate system of evaluation was rejected, whereas the state-organisation principle was reintroduced. Fur- thermore, the lines revealing the second layer of the assessment were printed in italics; a typography trick was supposed to install the modernising and event- ually "state-nation" based narration as a dominant one. However, despite its ostentatious modernising and liberal wording, the 1993 textbook conceived and presented the "national question" as "a question of unification of Bulgarians in their ethnic borders". Its history was articulated, firstly, in the struggles for " San-Stefano Bulgaria , a specific ideal focusing the 66</page><page sequence="17">desires of millions of people" (Bakalov et al. 1993: 468-473), and, secondly, in the fate of Bulgarians living outside Bulgaria (Ibid.: 470-471). Hence, "the national question" was related as a story of uprisings, wars, government foreign policies, insurgent leaders' biographies, revolutionary, cultural-educational and religious organisations and movements. By emphasising the endeavour to unite dispersed national elements in a single national body (based on common lan- guage, origin and past), the narration privileged the history of initial (ethnic) emancipation while the transition from " Kulturnation " to * Staatsnation " (through modern state institutions) was somehow excluded from the historical content of the Bulgarian national question. The creation of the " Kulturnation " was presented as the history of the national question, whereas the transition from "Kulturnation" to "Staatsnation " was covered by domestic policy's his- tory; hence, the textbook narration disintegrated into "two parallel proceeding histories". The first one, the "history of the national question", (including the history of the Macedonian question) was related as a history of foreign policy doctrines; the chapters on the national question failed to deal with the modern- isation problems of the nation, with its external and internal communication lines. The second history narrated the domestic policy of Bulgaria and its econ- omical advancement. This perspective certified that the nation had become tantamount to its citizens by means of adopting a constitution and, above all, by the struggles conducted for its preserving. This leads us to suppose that the textbook was a "the strange mixture" of ethnic (Herder-type) and civic (French-type) nationalism (Pitassio 1995).

Zusammenfassung Die Autoren dieses Artikels untersuchen zunächst die Formen des Nationalismus, die in Schulbüchern über bulgarische Geschichte seit der Gründung des modernen bulgarischen Staates 1878 tradiert worden sind. Anschließend analysieren sie das komplexe, viel- 69</page><page sequence="20">schichtige Wechselspiel zwischen dem nationalen Diskurs und dem kommunistischen, in- ternationalistisch geprägten Gedankengut. Obwohl ein gewisses Vordringen des staats- bürgerlichen Nationalismus - vor allem in dem post-kommunistischen Schulbuch von 1993 - daraus erkennbar wird, überwiegen die verschiedenen Gesichtszüge des ethni- schen Nationalismus. Das erste und das letzte Jahrzehnt der kommunistischen Herrschaft sind von einer Vermengung des nationalen Diskurses mit dem vorherrschenden, interna- tionalistischen Dogma gekennzeichnet, während der historische Materialismus von der Mitte der 50er Jahre bis zu den frühen 80er Jahren eine Monopolstellung in den Schul- büchern einnimmt. Résumé Les auteurs du présent article passent ďabord en revue les formes de nationalisme véhi- culées dans les manuels scolaires d'histoire bulgare depuis la fondation de l'Etat bulgare moderne en 1878, puis examinent l'interaction complexe entre le discours national et la conception communiste, internationaliste. Bien qu'une certaine progression du nationa- lisme civique - surtout dans le manuel post-communiste de 1993 - puisse y être discer- née, les différentes manifestations du nationalisme ethnique prédominent. Durant la pre- mière et la dernière décennie du régime communiste, le discours national s'est fondu au dogme internationaliste ayant cours, tandis qu'à partir du milieu des années cinquante jusqu'au début des années quatre-vingt, le matérialisme historique a exercé un monopole dans les manuels scolaires.
