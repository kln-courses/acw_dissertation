<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHY the stimulus coming from the world without rather than on the satisfaction of any instinct or desire that owes its origin to practical needs individual or social, is a welcome contribution to aesthetic philosophy, aligning the author with the sound tradition that finds in the works of poet, artist, or musician a revelation of the inner nature of the world he seeks to portray. It need hardly be added that a translation in the names of Fry and John is itself a work of art. J. H. MUIRHEAD. Religion in Virgil. By CYRIL BAILEY. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, Humphrey Milford. 1935. Price I5s. net.) There are books to which one refers from time to time because of their learning; others which are kept at hand, when they have been read through, to read them again for their charm, as a friend's conversation is sought. This modest volume, the permanent record of the Sather Classical Lectures in I932, has a claim to appear in both these categories. It combines erudition with total absence of pedantry, and literary appreciation with critical insight and powers of analysis none the less real because they do not display them- selves in long rows of statistics or formidable tables of the relative frequency of this and the percentages of that. It is a man of taste talking about a poet to those who are minded to hear him; and it happens that the taste is fortified with scholarship and a knowledge, not only of Latin and literature, but of philosophy and ancient religion. To know what one of the great minds, ancient or modern, felt concerning the world and its inhabitants, visible and invisible, can never be a matter of indifference, nor can his conclusions become obsolete, as those of a scientist may. Vergil has the added importance that his influence, both in his own age and later, has been enormous and continues to be great, reaching many who are not sympathetic to formal philosophical teaching and impatient of dogmatic theologies. To ask, therefore, what his religion was is to treat a problem which has permanent interest, but a problem complicated by the necessity of seeing him against the background of his time and disentangling what is personal in him both from mere echoing of current ideas and from conventional mythological machinery which he, as a poet, could no more avoid using than he could express himself in a language not then spoken. Therefore the author goes very properly to work when he begins by defining, in his first chapter, what is meant by "magic, omen, and prophecy," spends the next two chapters over old Italian religion, passes to the State cult of Rome, deals in Chapters V-VII with the Graeco-Roman gods, in Chapter VIII with deities Oriental and cosmological and with emperor-worship, gives another chapter to the question of "Fate and the gods," with an appendix on "the meaning of Fortuna in Virgil," treats next of "the dead and the underworld," and then gives us sixteen pages of "conclusion," in which the results arrived at are excellently summed up. Throughout the work an attempt is made to differentiate what Vergil thought and felt, his own personal religion or religious philosophy, from what he merely echoed. The instrument used is a simple one, little more than the author's necessarily subjective impressions; but, when handled by a trained mind long and thoroughly acquainted with the subject, such an instrument is quite as potent as many which make a greater parade of scientific accuracy and cold-blooded analysis. Dr. Bailey's feeling, then, is that Vergil had for the old traditional Italian cults, the so-called "religion of Numa," a "tender affection" (p. 303), founded, not on mere sentiment for the practices among which he had been brought 224</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS up, as a moder who no longer has any connection with an organized religion may still have a liking for a hymn learned in childhood or a liturgy reverenced by his parents, but on a "recognition of its spiritual value," that value con- sisting largely in its very vagueness. Vergil has an affection for the traditional deities of the woods and fields; but he is still more interested in and devoted to the ancestral ritual, which he knew with a thoroughness that impressed ancient commentators and furnishes welcome material for moderns who would learn the forms which the piety of the countryside took. For the conventional great gods and the conventional manner of approaching them he had much less deep feeling; for the picturesque anthropomorphic figures he had least of all; they were pretty, even beautiful, subjects for his fancy, but not objects either of solid belief or of profound emotion; nor had they been so, to any educated man, for centuries. But, for Vergil as for Varro and many other men of good will just then, even the State cult was not dead and might yet be the vehicle, albeit in a form which the understanding would interpret after their own fashion and not as its originators had done, of high thought and spiritual values. Apollo and his divine archery might be no more than a lovely figure of venerable tradition; it by no means followed that no superhuman power had watched over Augustus or guided the fortunes of the decisive day at Actium. So also with the beliefs concerning the dead. No one, certainly not Dr. Bailey, supposes that Vergil imagined it literally true that, if one went through certain prescribed rites and knew where to find a particular opening in the ground, he would come to a place where the ghosts of his ancestors flitted about in unsubstantial happiness or lay in supernatural torments. But this is not to say that Vergil assumed merely for poetical purposes the existence of the human soul. Rather "he takes the traditions of folk-lore and myth and using them as his framework, refines them to the measure of his own philosophic vision" (p. 315). That the soul, that man, dead or alive, was capable of "ultimate triumph coming through suffering" (p. 318), the author supposes to have been a serious belief of the poet, and the reviewer entirely agrees with him. In the case of so exceptional a man as the Emperor, Vergil did not flatter when he hailed him as a god, but rather, in the expression of a real belief, "outran the official pace" (p. I96), and was rather checked than incited by his knowledge of the official views on this subject. The Providence which ruled his universe, whatever traditional names of Fate and Fortune he might give it, could and did show itself through such a personality with such a mission; and such a man had genuinely in him not a little which could fairly be called divine. These then, in barest outline and with omission of a hundred controversial points of philological, historical, or philosophic detail, are the ideas concerning God and man which Dr. Bailey finds in the poet who was hailed as a prophet and a saint by many centuries of godly men, much though their own beliefs differed from one another's and from his; who was to Horace an anima candida, while the Middle Ages greeted him with da Christo testimonium.
