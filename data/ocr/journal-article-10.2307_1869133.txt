<plain_text><page sequence="1">Scholarship and Intolerance in the Medieval Academy: The Study and Evaluation of Judaism in European Christendom JEREMY COHEN RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FIELD of literary criticism have emphasized the influence of texts and textual traditions in shaping the world views of individuals and the cultures of societies. Perceptions of meaning, structure, and authority in literature, as well as the extent of its accessibility, reflect and contribute to manifold components of a community's ethos, ranging from the political and socioeconomic to the religious and intellectual. It follows that new methods for studying particular texts, or any alteration in the prevailing level of familiarity with them, may ultimately affect existing patterns of interpersonal relations and hitherto regnant ideologies in a given culture. Viewed within the context of the rise of urban schools and universities in.lhigh medieval Europe, the orientation of Christian scholars to the biblical and rabbinic literature of the Jews offers a fascinating case in point. Christianity had always acknowledged its debt to the Old Testament,' but the medieval church could not forget that a community of unbelievers-a people unique in its ability to withstand Christianity's conquest of the Roman world and to secure legal standing in Western Christendom nonetheless-served as the guardian of the original Hebrew text of the Old Testament and maintained the most literal observance of its precepts. Modern scholars have long recognized that, as the focus of medieval intellectual creativity shifted from monastery to urban school, Christian concern for the Hebraica veritas and rabbinic exegesis of the Bible increased markedly. This process had several implications for scholarly method and religious ideology. As their interest in Hebraic texts rose, Christian scholars of the period came to espouse the view that these texts, to serve as a valid source of religious and historical knowledge, had to be measured against the beliefs and instruction of contemporary Jews. Yet when influential churchmen, true to the Scholastic spirit of their age, turned to these beliefs as a subject for academic scrutiny in their own right, they perceived that such a comparison threatened to An earlier version of this paper was presented to a symposium entitled "From Cloister to Classroom: Monastic and Scholastic Approaches to Truth," held at Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo,June 1983.

Ultimately, medieval theologians realized the need for a new approach to the Jews and their textual traditions, attuned to historical reality but compliant with the demands of fundamental Christian doctrine. I believe that there is a linkage between the intellectual awakening of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, on the one hand, and simultaneous changes in Christian anti-Judaism, on the other. Granted, this period witnessed important political and socioeconomic developments that directly influenced the way Europeans treated the Jews-along with changes in the Jewish posture toward Christians and their faith-but the present discussion will not concern them. Rather, three contem- poraneous trends in high medieval culture contributed to an increase in Christian anti-Judaism: (1) methodological advances in Christian scholarship (ever present in this period) and the gradual emergence of theology as an independent academic discipline; (2) the Christian pursuit of Hebraic scholarship and literalist exegesis of the Old Testament; and (3) the increasingly hostile ideological stance of the church toward the European Jewish community. Each of these developments has received ample consideration in recent scholarly literature, but the nature of their interdependence still awaits explication.2 Focusing on the nexus between method and ideology in the study of religious texts, I propose to assess the significance of that interdependence prior to the career of Anselm of Canterbury and the First Crusade, in the midst of the cultural ferment and experimentation that charac- terized the twelfth century, and through the high Scholastic attempts at intellectual synthesis in the thirteenth century. DESPITE THE EXCEPTIONAL AND ADMITTEDLY significant portents of change in Christian exegesis that appear in some eleventh-century Christian polemics, the study of Christian doctrine before the twelfth century principally consisted of the reading and figurative interpretation of the Bible.

They perpet- uated the Augustinian notion that religious truth could be derived entirely from the text of Scripture, if only that text were properly understood. This idea affected the Christian attitude toward the books of the Jews. Above all, it insured the centrality of the Old Testament-and, by extension, the opposition between the Old Testament and the New-in the study of theology. It also militated against the maturation of biblical exegesis as an academic discipline just as it impeded that of theology. If the Bible had to meet all of the theologian's needs, those needs a priori colored his appreciation of the scriptural text. According to Augustine, the perfection and goal (plenitudo etfinis) of the Bible and biblical study were the love of God. Such a consideration not only relegated non-canonical texts to a markedly inferior status but also determined the appropriateness of literal or figurative exegesis for any specific passage of Scripture. Augustine explained simply to his readers, "Whatever in the word of God cannot be related in its literal sense to moral virtue or doctrinal truth you may recognize as figurative." As a result, Heiko Obermann correctly observed, there was "no objective standard by which to separate the literal sense-or the clear places in Scripture-from the allegorical sense-or the obscure places." This distinction was not grounded in the text but was "largely dependent on the relation of the reader to God."3 No wonder that the historical study of Scripture was largely neglected during the early Middle Ages or that churchmen generally failed to procure the tools that would have promoted it-in the case of the Old Testament, familiarity with the Jewish traditions that embodied it and knowledge of Hebrew. Instead, because of their preoccupation with the contrast between church and synagogue, Catholic theologians identified the literal meaning of Mosaic law with all that the Christian covenant of grace had supplanted. In that case, the interest of pedant or antiquarian aside, how could the literal sense of the Old Testament enhance appreciation of Catholic doctrine? Therefore, if many publicly advocated the study of Hebrew for the sake of understanding the Bible, few bothered to act on their own advice.4 Alongside this valuation of the Old Testament developed a particular Christian attitude toward the medieval Jew who followed its precepts. Augustine had also instructed that the Jew had survived-and should survive-in Christendom, precisely because he maintained the biblical tradition that bespoke the truth of Christianity.5 And, if doctrinal considerations shaped Christian understanding of Jewish Scripture, so too did they mold the Christian conception of theJews, an idea 3 Augustine, De doctrina christiana, 1.84-85,3.33-34, CSEL 80: 30,62-63,88; and Heiko Augustinus Obermann, Forerunners of the Reformation: The Shape of Late Medieval Thought (New York, 1966), 283-84. 4 On Christians' knowledge of Hebrew, see Berthold Altaner, "Zur Kenntnis des Hebraischen im Mittelalter," Biblische Zeitschrift, 21 (1938): 288-308; and Matthias Thiel, Grundlagen und Gestalt der Hebrdischkenntnisse desfriiheren Mittelalters, Biblioteca degli studi medievali, vol. 4 (Spoleto, 1973). 5 Augustine, Tractatus adversusJudaeos, PL 42: 51-67; De civitate Die, 18.46, 20.29, Sermo, 200.2, PL 38: 1030; Enarrationes in Psalmos, 58.1.21-22, CCSL 39: 744; and Defide rerum invisibilum, 6.9, CCSL 46: 15-16.

Beryl Smalley aptly noted "how deeply the spiritual interpretation will penetrate language, thought, politics, and finally everyday life. The types are so real and so familiar that they may be used as arguments from authority, as well as for illustration. Their influence may be beneficent or sinister. The Synagogue is always opposed to the Church as darkness to light, and gradually this type becomes identified with the livingJew.... Philo's 'wise architect' [of allegorical exegesis] had built a prison for the Jewish people."6 The AdversusJudaeos tradition in patristic and medieval theology, through which the church asserted its legitimacy and validity, was serviced by the existence ofJews who typified life under the Old Testament. Doctrinally, the Jew had to remain, in Augustine's words, "stationary in useless antiquity," thereby bearing unconscious witness to the authenticity of the new Israel. This belief at the root of classical Christian theology helped insure the toleration of the Jews in early medieval Europe, but it prolonged Christian ignorance of the postbiblical, rabbinic religion that characterized medieval Jewish life, despite the legacy of classical rabbinic midrash that pervaded the methods and structures of patristic exegesis.7 Anti-Jewish polemicists of the early Middle Ages accordingly took little notice of the contemporary Jew, not because he was inaccessible to them but because, his proximity notwithstanding, he served little purpose in their arguments. These generally constituted an annotated list of biblical passages, usually from the Old Testament, which attested to the basic doctrines of Christian theology and which might depict the triumph of the church and the present subjugation of the Jews as foretold in Israelite prophecy.8 Fulbert of Chartres, for example, whose three polemical sermons against the Jews undertook to prove their messianic hopes wrong and the doctrines of Christianity correct, relied entirely on biblical evidence. Like most medieval authors before him, Fulbert did not intend his polemic for use against a live Jewish audience but presented Jewish arguments-readily available in earlier Christian literature-as a foil, in order to strengthen the faith of his Christian listeners.9 And, as late as the mid-eleventh century, Peter Damian, himself an avid exponent of reform in the Western Church, authored two anti-Jewish treatises that similarly rehashed the usual scriptural testimonies and 6 Smalley, Study of the Bible, 25-26. 7 On the influence of rabbinic midrash on patristic exegesis, see, among others, Harry Austryn Wolfson, The Philosophy of the Church Fathers (2d edn., Cambridge, Mass., 1964), 24-96 passim; and Raphael Loewe, "The Jewish Midrashim and Patristic and Scholastic Exegesis of the Bible," Studia patristica, 1 (1957): 492-524. 8 Amos Funkenstein, "Basic Types of Christian Anti-Jewish Polemics in the Later Middle Ages," Viator, 2 (1971): 373-75.

Of note are Damian's naive confidence that his biblical citations would triumph-in an actual face-to-face debate-over "every insanity of Jewish depravity" and his telling remark that disputing with contemporary Jews should not rank high among the priorities of the church.'0 This relatively stagnant approach to the study of Jewish texts underwent dramatic change in the twelfth century. Lawyers, exegetes, and philosophers recognized more clearly the problem of conflicting authorities in the heritage of the church and offered a variety of solutions for reconciling them. Systems of rational analysis became the principal methodology in the exposition of sacred doctrine, challenging the procedure and substance of much patristic teaching based solely on the figurative interpretation of Scripture. The Crusades, which also reawakened Europe to the problematic status of the Jew, generally broadened the social, economic, and cultural frontiers of European Christendom. Cities, indus- try, and commerce were all on the rise and with them a new urban locus for the study of theology, a setting that inevitably increased the interaction between Christian scholar and Jew. Those who cultivated Christian spirituality no longer confined themselves to the monastery but turned directly to the natural world, seeking to understand it, to rationalize it, and to incorporate all of its facets into the totality of Christian life. The rebellion against patristic methodology, the insistence on a more scientific explication of texts, the demand that religious ideas bespeak the realia of history-all of these contributed to a renewed interest in and the greater influence of Jewish books in twelfth-century Christendom. With instructively different evaluations of the phenomena, Beryl Smalley, Henri de Lubac, M. D. Chenu, and others have all demonstrated the burgeoning of literalist exegesis of the Old Testament, the widening tendency to view the observance of Mosaic law as meritorious and justificatory in its own time, and the greater use of Mosaic precepts to explain and authenticate contemporary Christian institutions and practices. Concern for the Hebraica veritas gained prominence in Christian Old Testament commentary, and exegetes began to involve themselves in the study of the Hebrew language, either with the help of converted Jews or with that of medieval rabbis, who were themselves placing greater emphasis on the literal meaning of Scripture (peshat) rather than on its homiletic sense (derash). Yet Christian commentators sought far more than linguistic instruction from theJews. For who could better understand the primary meaning and significance of the Old Testament than those who continued to observe and promulgate the literal sense of its teachings? Beryl Smalley put it well: "When the medieval scholar talked to a Rabbi he felt that he was telephoning to the Old Testament.""l Literal-minded '?

The forthrightness and ease with which Hugh of St. Victor, his student Andrew, Peter Comestor, and Stephen Harding (to list only a few) justified their instruction from rabbis, juxtaposed rabbinic traditions with traditional Christian exegesis, and even preferred the former over the latter has been much discussed in recent scholarship, but it still cannot fail to astound the student of Christian-Jewish relations.'2 One would expect that the perception of the medieval Jew as spokesman for the Old Testament would have reinforced the anti-Jewish tone of earlier polemics, grounded as they were in the premises that the biblical character of Judaism had not changed since antiquity and that the Jews therefore served to convey the meaning of their Scriptures to the Christians who tolerated them. Most of the extant Christian polemics from the twelfth century do validate this assumption. Some, to be sure, incorporate the conciliatory, rationalistic approach of Anselm of Canterbury, who asserted that the Jews could have rejected Jesus and Christianity only out of blind ignorance, which actually lessened their guilt for the crime of deicide; as rational human beings, the Jews needed only effective enlightenment to the truth.13 Others, such as the popular and influential Disputatio Judei et Christiani of Gilbert Crispin, also manifest the rising frequency of intellectual exchanges between Christians andJews, as well as a growing familiarity withJewish responses to the Christological teachings of the church; the author of a theological treatise of the school of Abelard actually quoted Scripture in Hebrew as he appealed to the Jews to convert.'4 Nevertheless, as a general rule, the Jews continued to be typed as theological relics, the proponents of a carnal under- standing of scriptural prophecy, which Christianity had supplanted and replaced. The language and arguments of the polemics remain overwhelmingly biblical. Polemicists failed to comprehend the historical significance and interpretative character of the evolving rabbinic tradition that regulated contemporary Jewish 12 Smalley herself wrote that what "drove scholars to study the literal sense of the Old Testament" is "one of the darkest problems connected with the twelfth-century revival"; Smalley, "An Early Twelfth-Century Commentator on the Literal Sense of Leviticus," Recherches de theiologie ancienne et medie'vale, 35 (1969): 98. 13 For example, see Anselm, Cur Deus homo, 2.15.

As a result, they showed little interest in undermining the status of theJew within Christian society, either through active proselytism or through forms of physical persecution.'5 Even Peter Alfonsi's Dialogue with Moses the Jew (Peter's name before he converted from Judaism to Christianity), noted for its reference to a number of postbiblical talmudic homilies, conforms to this general pattern.'6 Peter stated at the outset that he composed his polemic in order to defend his recent conversion againstJewish charges of sacrilege, intellectual error, and opportunism. He never challenged the propriety of Jewish survival in Christendom, and he pursued his dialogue not with other prospective converts but solely with his alterego Moses. The debate ultimately concerns the correct interpretation of Scripture. Peter openly acknowledged that the Jews were the followers (cultores) of Mosaic law- their misinterpretation of it notwithstanding-and he acceded to Moses' request that in citing the Bible he make use of the Hebraica veritas. He devoted eight of the twelve chapters of his polemic to a justification of Christianity on primarily scriptural grounds. Only in the first three chapters did Peter turn to rabbinic texts to demonstrate his disenchantment with Judaism. "Show me," demanded Moses, "how it seems to you that the Jews have erred in the interpretation of the [Old Testament] Law, and that you indeed understand better." Pointing to the frequently anthropomorphic midrashim, a series of which he proceeded to criticize, Peter responded: "Inasmuch as you see them attending solely to the superficial meaning of the Law, expounding the text not according to the spirit (spiritualiter) but according to the flesh (carnaliter), whence they are deceived by the greatest error." Yet, while alleging that continued rabbinic adherence to the literal meaning of the Old Testament drove him away from the Jewish community, Peter actually cited an array of figurative, imaginative homilies that ranged far and wide beyond the letter of the biblical text. 17 Here lies the crux of the issue. From Peter's Christian perspective, any Jewish interpretation of the Old Testament was necessarily literal and thus to be distinguished from the true, spiritual, Christological reading of Scripture, for such was the role of the Jews in the divine economy of salvation. Although hisJewish upbringing and education should have enabled Peter to reveal the postbiblical character of contemporary Judaism to his Christian coreligionists, the demands of Augustinian theology weighed so heavily in his reading of Jewish texts that he could not. In his assessment of Jewish Scripture, Peter Alfonsi anticipated the judgment with which Peter of Blois 15 Berger, "Gilbert Crispin"; Margaret Schlauch, "The Allegory of the Church and the Synagogue," Speculum, 14 (1939): 448-64; and M.-H. Vicaire,"'Contra Judaeos' meridionaux au debut du XIIIe siele: Alain de Lille, Evrard de Bethune, Guillaume de Bourges," in Juifs et judaisme de Languedoc, Cahiers de Fanjeaux, vol. 13 (Toulouse, 1977), 269-93. 16 Peter Alfonsi, Dialogus Petri et Moysi Judei, PL 157: 535-672. 17 Ibid., 540. Subsequently, Peter wrote that, because the statements of the biblical prophets were often obscure, they should be interpreted allegorically if their literal sense would cause readers to veer from the path of reason ("talia ... quae secundum litteram accipientes a rationis tramite exorbitemus, ea allegorice interpretamur"). The rabbis, however, did not perceive God properly ("non cognoverunt, ut oportuit, Deum"), and they therefore erred by interpreting prophetic teaching literally. Precisely in this regard Peter believed that he understood Scripture better than the Jews-that is, as reason would demand ("prout sanus exigit sensus"). Ibid., 553.</page><page sequence="8">Scholarship and Intolerance 599 prefaced his own anti-Jewish polemic. If, as Richard W. Southern has argued, this other Peter embodied much of the distinctive intellectual spirit of the twelfth century, we can appreciate his words as encapsulating the still-prevalent approach to the Jews and their books. "Even today the Jews are to be allowed to live, because they are our enslaved book-bearers (capsarii), as they carry around the prophets and the law of Moses for the assertion of our faith. Not only in their books but also in their faces do we read of the passion of Christ."'8 A NEW INTEREST IN HEBREW and rabbinic exegesis among Christian scholars, coupled with the need to retain the conviction thatJudaism was essentially a fossil of biblical antiquity, raised serious questions and caused concern among various churchmen of the High Middle Ages. Did the use of Jewish sources as auctoritates conform to the underlying premises of Christian anti-Jewish polemic? Could granting a particular measure of truth to Jewish texts alter the Christian perception of contemporary Judaism? If rabbinic interpretation of the Old Testament was assumed to convey its literal meaning, positive Christian valuation of the Hebraica veritas and its historical sense could cast a presumption of significance and legitimacy on Jewish traditions, and this might in turn undermine the basic contrast between carnal Judaism and spiritual Christianity at the heart of the AdversusJudaeos tradition. The opposition between the letter and the spirit of the law had always been the foundation of Christianity's claims to validity, and this opposition had facilitated the conception ofJudaism as stationary and antique, which had prompted seekingJewish help on the literal sense of the Old Testament in the first place. When a Christian exegete of the twelfth century expounded the historical meaning of a biblical passage, perhaps even at the neglect of its Christolqgical meaning, or when he approached a rabbi for advice in interpreting such a text, he assuredly did not deem his action an admission of the rectitude of Judaism. Yet in attributing relevance and importance to the contemporary Jewish understanding of the letter of the law, his exegesis could be construed as subverting the very set of theological assumptions that had spawned it. One can thus appreciate the fear of literalism of Richard of St. Victor, himself a Hebraist, when he read the commentaries of Andrew of St. Victor and his successors. I have come upon a certain treatise of Master Andrew, which he wrote in explanation of Isaiah .. ., in which I have found several things imprudently taken for granted and argued in an unorthodox manner [minus catholice]. For in many instances in his treatise, the opinion of the Jews is cited as if it were not merely the Jews' but his own-and true. On the passage, "Behold a virgin will conceive and bear a son," he raises the questions or objections of the Jews and does not resolve them; and it appears as though he has given them victory, because he has left them [that is, their objections] as if they were insoluble. In matters of this sort those more informed are scandalized and those less informed are defamed, inasmuch as 18 Peter of Blois, Contra perfidiam Judaeorum, PL 207: 825. Also see Southern, "Peter of Blois: A Twelfth Century Humanist?" in his Medieval Humanism, 105-32.</page><page sequence="9">600 AHR Forum even today there are those among his students who explain the aforementioned prophecy not in terms of the blessed Mary, but rather concerning a certain prophetess.19 One ought not to conclude that Andrew of St. Victor either denied the belief in the Virgin Birth or even challenged its allegorical prefiguration in Isa. 7:14. Enthusiastically applying his Hebraic knowledge to his commentary on an Old Testament text, he simply allowed his penchant for literalism to run free of theological concern and constraint. Nevertheless, Richard of St. Victor did compose his De Emmanuele to redress Andrew's error, which from Richard's perspective revealed not only a preference for the historical over the figurative interpretation of a single prophetic verse but also the ostensive preference of the literalist exegetes, indignantly dubbed judaizantes nostri, for Judaic over Christian hermeneutic. In Richard's view, Andrew and his disciples had interpreted the Old Testamentindependently of the New, paying little heed to the dictates of Catholic doctrine and ecclesiology, thereby enhancing the stature of Judaism at Christianity's expense. Richard's sentiments accompanied the transmission of Andrew's commentaries into the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and are echoed even today in the monumental Exege'se medievale of Henri de Lubac.20 If the new literalism of twelfth-century commentators like Andrew might undermine hallowed Christian teachings, the frequently concomitant reliance on rabbinic interpretations in explaining a scriptural text posed a related theoretical problem. His innocence notwithstanding, a churchman who sought instruction from a contemporary rabbi might unintentionally accredit the traditions of postbiblical Judaism, tacitly acknowledging that they embodied a meaningful understanding of the Old Testament. Yet, properly understood, rabbinic tradi- tions also demonstrated that Judaism had not remained "stationary in useless antiquity" ever since the day of the crucifixion, as Augustine had presumed, and it was Augustine's assumption that had provided primary theological justification for tolerating Europe's growingJewish community, as well as for the church's claim to have inherited God's biblical covenant from a stagnant, moribund Judaism. Medieval Christians hitherto owed most of their minimal knowledge of rabbinic traditions to Jerome, who considered them (as Peter Alfonsi did) an extension of the Jews' Old Testament perspective on divine and prophetic revelation;2' The enthusiasm with which some prominent Christian exegetes now sought rabbinic instruction awakened doubts among others.

Jerome himself had emphasized that the Hebrew text of the Old Testament contained important evidence of the truth of Christian doctrine not found in Greek or Latin translations, unless the Jews had later distorted various passages that Christian polemicists had used against them. Rufinus maintained that such corruption had taken place on a grand scale, that now, because of the deceit of Jews who lived after the birth of Christianity, the Latin biblical text was more trustworthy than the Greek, the Greek more than the Hebrew. His concern was soon echoed by a series of influential canon lawyers: Johannes Faventinus, Huguccio, the author of the Glossa palatina, and Joannes Teutonicus.22 As I have argued elsewhere, the view of rabbinic Judaism as having deviated from its biblical predecessor came to maturity in the mendicant anti-Jewish polemic of the thirteenth century.23 Twelfth-century churchmen did not perceive the extent and substance of talmudic literature and thus generally did not realize the troublesome ramifications that a new literal exegesis posed. Some writers, like Peter the Venerable of Cluny and the exegete Herbert of Bosham, did attempt to confront rabbinic teaching directly, but they failed to recognize the inconsistencies and contradictions in their treatments of the Jews and their traditions. In their studies of Herbert's commentary on Jerome's Hebrew Psalter, Beryl Smalley and Raphael Loewe have illustrated the impressive scope of this English scholar's Hebraic and Judaic knowledge. Impelled to understand the literal sense of Scripture despite its admitted inferiority to the spiritual, Herbert acquired facility in Hebrew and even Aramaic. He consulted contemporary rabbis, perused Jewish biblical commentaries and medieval textbooks on Hebrew grammar, and appears actually to have read from the Talmud and works of classical rabbinic midrash, and his work displays a remarkable familiarity with the subtleties of rabbinic hermeneutics, as well as with the history of the Masoretic Text. He did not shy away from criticizing Jewish opinion or from expressing sympathy with Richard of St. Victors' rebuke of judaizantes nostri. Yet knowledge gleaned from Jewish books remains the primary auctoritas, the foundation for Herbert's understanding of the 22 Jerome wrote in his preface to the Pentateuch: "Sicubi tibi in translatione videor errare, interroga Hebraeos, diversarum urbium magistros consule: quod illi habent de Christo, tui codices non habent.

He accused Christian commentators of corrupting the Hebrew text to support their messianic arguments. When he did understand a Psalm Christologically, he rarely took the time to expound it doctrinally, and he still evinced greater interest in the rejected Jewish teaching. He seems to have been completely at ease with Christological interpretation only when he could support it with rabbinic evidence; Christian exposition of the literal sense, his method suggests, should ideally comport with Jewish exegesis.24 It is of particular significance, then, that Herbert's commentary itself provided fuel for the argu- ment to invalidate rabbinic interpretations of Scripture, for he also suggested that rabbinic traditions embodied a heretical departure from the true, antique religion of biblical Israel. On a number of occasions, Herbert noted the differences in the beliefs and practices of ancient and medieval Jews; at times he accused contem- porary rabbis of deliberately obscuring their ancestral traditions. Commenting on Ps. 2, he wrote: Modern Jewish scholars state that things in the Psalm ... were explained by their ancient masters as pertaining to the messiah. They themselves do furnish the truth in their senseless little explanations; but, piecing together statements of the Psalm on the spur of the moment, as if they in fact wrote them, they prefer that Quare fremuerunt etc. [that is, Ps. 2] be interpreted these days with regard to King David-so as not to assent to ecclesiastical opinion, and to condemn the men of the Church. It is indeed the error of a perverse, depraved generation and its obstinate hatred of the truth, which prefers to deviate from its own masters and the authority of its sages, knowingly and intentionally to distort the Scriptures, so as not to espouse their ecclesiastical interpretation which its own ancient masters actually held!25 Herbert neither recognized nor followed the implications of his logic. To the end of his life, he remained ambivalent toward the Judaic understanding of Scrip- ture-maintaining his valuation of the literal sense and, accordingly, obliged to justify the persistence of his Christian faith. Even though he lacked Herbert's Hebraic knowledge, Peter the Venerable, in his lengthy polemic against the Jews, also accused the postbiblical rabbis of abandoning the divine precepts of Scripture for the sake of the illegitimate teachings of men.26 In particular, Peter criticized a number of talmudic homilies, whose logical absurdities and anthropomorphisms, he maintained, revealed the bestial, satanic character of contemporary Judaism. He voiced the rationalist spirit of his age, but in a line of argument diametrically opposed to that of Anselm of 24 Beryl Smalley, "A Commentary on the Hebraica by Herbert of Bosham," Recherches de theologie ancienne et medievale, 18 (1951): 29-65; and Raphael Loewe, "Herbert of Bosham's Commentary on Jerome's Hebrew Psalter," Biblica, 34 (1953): 44-77, 159-92, 275-98. 25 Smalley, "A Commentary on the Hebraica," 57.

For Peter, since the Jews spurned the blatantly rational truth of Christianity, they must have been less than human, and their blasphemous Talmud was to blame.27 Peter attributed little value to a knowledge of Hebrew; Greek and Latin translations of the Bible afforded Christians precisely the same entree to the truth, while the teachings of Jewish tradition were grossly unac- ceptable.28 He proclaimed to the Jews: I extend to you before the whole world, 0 beastlyJew, that book of yours-yes, your book, that Talmud of yours, that illustrious doctrine of yours, which is to be preferred to prophetic books and all authentic teachings.... The Jewish Talmud cannot be that book of which it is said, "in thy book they are all recorded" [Ps. 139:16].... Who besides Satan can teach such absurd things, and who besides the Jew can listen to, if not believe, them-that the reading of the Talmud can prejudice the power of God, that the incredible recitation of an infernal book can impede the will and mandate of God? For is that book of yours, 0 Jew, holier than the five books of Moses, holier than the books of the prophets, better or more worthy? . .. You have fought for so long against divine books with diabolical ones, and you have striven to tinge and obscure heavenly doctrine with the smoke of the infernal pit.29 Some historians have concluded that Peter hereby repudiated the conception of the Jew and Judaism that gave rise to the literalist exegesis of the twelfth century, that for him the medieval Jew was no longer the Jew of the Bible and rabbinic religion was nothing less than a perversion of realJudaism.30 Yet a careful reading of Peter's anti-Jewish pronouncements reveals inconsistency and ambivalence. Like those of Herbert of Bosham, his comments suggest that contemporary Judaism and the religion of the Old Testament were not the same, but, without direct access to the Talmud, he failed to perceive the implications of his polemic. The Jews accordingly remained the guardians of the biblical books and tradition, 27 Peter the Venerable, AdversusJudeorum inveteratam duritiem, CCCM 58: 57-58: "Patet ergo quia non ab huiusmodi canibus, sed a Iudaeis longe hiis deterioribus Christus ad occisionem ducendus a propheta praedictus est.

In a polemic against Islam, Peter even blamed the infidelity of Muhammad on the Jews and their rabbinic fables; Peter the Venerable, Summa totius haeresis Saracenorum, in James Kritzeck, Peter the Venerable and Islam, Princeton Oriental Studies, vol. 23 (Princeton, N.J., 1964), 206, and, in the English translation, 131-32: "And in order that the whole fullness of iniquity should come together in Mohammed, and that nothing should be lacking for his damnation and that of others, Jews were joined to the heretic. And lest [Mohammed] become a true Christian, the Jews, craftily providing for this man eager for novelties, whispered to Mohammed not the truth of the scriptures, but their own fables in which they abound even now. Thus Mohammed, instructed by the best Jewish and heretical doctors, produced his Koran and wove together, in that barbarous fashion of his, a diabolical scripture, put together both from theJewish fables and the trifling songs of heretics." 30 Amos Funkenstein forcefully maintained that Peter, breaking with the precedent set by Jerome, ceased to consider rabbinic Judaism a mere corollary of a literal understanding of Scripture. Peter, argued Funkenstein, instead considered "the Talmud the Jewish equivalent of the New Testament- that is, a different nova lex-and that, all would agree, was heresy"; "Ha-Temurot be-Vikkuah ha-Dat," 140.</page><page sequence="13">604 AHR Forum distinguished for the unity and steadfastness of their loyalty to Mosaic law.3' Their Talmud may have manifested a "bovine intellect," but Peter persisted in the traditional estimation of the Jews as blind to the truth of Scripture rather than as cognizant and deliberately unfaithful.32 The Talmud, in other words, perpetuated the pre-Christian religion of ancient Israel, carnal understanding of the Bible and all. Rabbinic Judaism, albeit abominable, did not depart from the letter of the obsolete Mosaic covenant; it was not a heresy. In Peter's view, the "blasphemous, sacrilegious, ridiculous, and false" doctrine of talmudic Judaism emerged when Israelite prophecy ended; it antedated Jesus and thus comprised at least part of the religious outlook that Christianity came to replace.33 Peter, therefore, could identify the Talmud's homilies with "the endless fables, and the traditions utterly foreign to the law of God, of which the Lord said to the Pharisees in the Gospel [Matt. 15:7], 'You have abandoned the precepts of God for the sake of your own traditions."' Just as Peter Alfonsi had ignored the figurative, imaginative character of rabbinic Aggadah, so, too, Peter the Venerable attributed the error in talmudic interpretation to a mentality that insisted on interpreting a sacred text only literally, admitting "neither metaphor, nor allegory, nor any of the customary modes of figurative speech, through which all these things may rightfully be interpreted as applying to God."34 EuropeanJews still played their instructive part in the divine.economy of salvation. "There is fulfilled in you, 0 wretched people, what your apostle by birth, ours in terms of doctrine, said of such things: 'The time will come when they will not stand wholesome teaching, but follow their own fancy and gather a crowd of teachers to tickle their ears. They will stop their ears to the truth and turn to mythology' [2 Tim. 4:3-4]."35 Peter's anti-Jewish writings display no desire to promote proselytism; he consistently reaffirmed that the Jews ought not to be killed. Bearing the mark of Cain, the Jews should surely be subjugated and oppressed, but their traditions had not yet been judged incompatible with their toleration by Christian society.36 THIRTEENTH-CENTURY SCHOLASTICISM BROUGHT the academic discipline of theol- ogy to maturity. The innovative methodologies of previous generations, who were propelled by an unquenchable thirst for discovery and investigation, successfully 31 Peter the Venerable, Liber contra sectam sive haeresim Saracenorum, in Kritzeck, Peter the Venerable, 252-53. Granted, the immediate purpose of this passage, in which Peter stated that Jews everywhere maintained copies of the same biblical books, is to counter Muslim assertions of the ancient loss and subsequent corruption of Scripture, but the implication that the Jews remained faithful to a canon of authentic, antique texts is unavoidable. 32 Peter the Venerable, AdversusJudeorum inveteratam duritiem, CCCM 58: 1, 32, 42-43, 70, 89. 33 Ibid., 186. 34 Ibid., 152.

Schoolmen of the thirteenth century capitalized on the flurry of translations from Arabic and Greek into Latin, attempting to assemble all available knowledge in their exposition of sacred doctrine, just as they banded together in universities to formulate the intellectual syntheses that marked the age. No critical faculty was left uncultivated in what Jaroslav Pelikan has dubbed "the reintegration of the Catholic tradition." And the summa, the hallmark of thirteenth-century scholarship, was not complete without a reconciliation of all conflicting arguments, from authority or from reason, or without an intellectually compelling fusion of seemingly discordant ideas and texts. Significantly, the Scholastic synthesis did not rest in the ivory tower; it attempted to create a harmony between theory and practice, to apply the logic and conclusions of theological scholarship to social structures and individual lives. Scholasticism accordingly contributed to the flowering of an applied or missionary theology, intent on converting the infidel, rehabilitating the heretic, and insuring that all components of an organismically conceived Christian society worked toward the interests of the whole in every avenue of life. Schoolmen not only recovered, restored, and scrutinized ancient biblical and patristic texts but also developed new reference tools and methods of indexing these materials, which facilitated their availability to and utility for preachers as well as academicians. If the theological masters collected and studied works of Greek and Muslim philosophers, they also strove to eliminate all challenges to the Christian world view posed by these works. They implemented ecclesiastical directives to restrict the dissemination of dangerous ideas-above all those of Aristotle-and they con- demned their colleagues who pursued the logic of Averroism beyond the limits of Christian responsibility. The summa, the universities, and the friars of the new mendicant orders who sought to realize the totalistic vision of their age-whether as academicians, preachers, inquisitors, or missionaries-all gave expression to the same ideological premise: intellectual activities were appropriately governed by Christian principles and directed toward Christian ends.37 These developments precipitated noteworthy changes in Christian attitudes toward the Jews and their books. Freed in some measure from its traditional enslavement to the exposition of Christian doctrine, thirteenth-century biblical exegesis refined its theories of signification in literary texts, formalizing the distinction between literal and spiritual senses and placing greater emphasis still on the former. Recognition of the value of the Hebraica veritas became more 3 SeeJean Leclercq, "The Renewal of Theology," in Benson and Constable, Renaissance andRenewal, 68-87; Nikolaus Haring, "Commentary and Hermeneutics," in ibid., 173-200; Richard H.

At the same time, however, new polemics appeared that rejected the contemporary Jew as no longer valuable in illuminating or enhancing the encounter between Latin Christendom and the Old Testament. The church's scholars gained considerable familiarity with postbiblical rabbinic tradition, and they now could perceive the historical evolution that separated antique biblical Judaism from the religion of medieval Jewry. Some deemed the European Jewish community unfit for toleration on theoretical grounds, given its abandonment of the stagnant, Old Testament way of life with which Augustine had justified its preservation. No longer was Judaism a mere foil that facilitated the Christological assertions of the polemicist. Anti-Jewish polemic assumed a much more direct and aggressive character; it aimed to undermine the presence and security of the Jew in a properly ordered Christian society. In all of this, one can discern an awakening to ideological inconsistencies that appeared to underlie the twelfth-century valuation of rabbinic instruction in Christian exegesis, and an effort to resolve them. Christian scholars finally grew sensitive to the interplay of their use ofJewish tradition with the logical demands of their Adversus Judaeos polemic. The most telling evidence of these developments remains the well-known assault of the thirteenth-century church on the Talmud. Indicted before Pope Grego- ry IX by an embittered Jewish apostate, Nicholas Donin, in 1236, the Talmud was denounced in a series of papal bulls in 1239 and 1244, burned in Paris under papal direction in 1242, subsequently condemned by a commission of prelates and university masters in 1248, and attacked repeatedly by the church during the later Middle Ages.39 The ecclesiastical treatment of the Talmud exemplifies the predilection of church scholars in the high Scholastic period to discover, to scrutinize, to understand, to classify, and actively to employ the contents of all available texts in their syntheses. Donin may have served as an important catalyst in the emergence of the church's new stance toward rabbinic Judaism, but the extent and impact of the new attitude quickly transcended the limited sphere of his personal influence. Two hundred years earlier, even someone like Donin could not have elicited the forceful response enunciated by the papacy in the 1230s and 1240s, and, even without Donin, the ideological climate of thirteenth-century 38 Among others, see Smalley, Study of the Bible, chap. 6; Raphael Loewe, "The Medieval History of the Latin Vulgate," in P.

It is telling that, in the realm of metaphysics, thirteenth-century Christian philosophers expended great energy to grapple with the systems of Arabic andJewish thinkers, so like and yet unlike their own, feeling compelled to assimilate them and to overcome them simultaneously. The Jew Moses Maimonides thus commanded respect as a philosophical authority in the Christian academy; his philosophical formulations served as a model for blending Aristotelian science with faith in the God of the Bible and for demonstrating the limits of rational inquiry. William of Auvergne and Thomas Aquinas frequently appropriated the rationalist Maimonidean exegesis of the Mosaic commandments, asserting their rightfulness and purpose in their original setting and thereby promoting the Christian study of the Old Testament in its literal sense.40 Nevertheless, this positive estimation of Maimonidean thought did not prevent Dominican inquisitors from burning the works of Maimonides as heretical, Thomas Aquinas from reproaching him for abandoning the literal meaning of Scripture, and Giles of Rome from condemning him for forsaking the rational truth of biblical revelation.41 Given such an intellectual climate, the amplitude and theological-historical implications of talmudic literature provoked a swift, delib- erate reaction. The Christian encounter with the Talmud demonstrates that growing numbers of influential churchmen were acquiring an interest in rabbinic texts and recognizing the importance of greater familiarity with them. On the one hand, a rabbinic interpretation of Scripture continued to inform Christian understanding of the literal, historical sense of the Old Testament. On the other hand, in its discovery of the Talmud, the thirteenth-century church also discerned the postbiblical character of rabbinic tradition and perceived the threat that it posed to the Augustinian notion of what the Jews and their books were supposed to be. Talmudic and midrashic texts thus had to be mastered and persecuted at the same 40 Beryl Smalley, "William of Auvergne, John of LaRochelle and St. Thomas of Aquinas on the Old Law," in St. ThomasAquinas, 1274-1974, Commemorative Studies, 2 vols.

William of Auvergne, Albert the Great, and Hugh of St. Cher openly applied their knowledge of rabbinic sources in their writings, and yet they all participated actively in the Parisian condemna- tions of the Talmud. Raymond de Peniaforte-who served as papal confessor when Gregory IX received Donin at the curia, who stood at the helm of the Order of Friars Preachers when the Dominicans played a leading role in the auto-da-fe of 1242 against the Talmud, and who clearly shared the view of contemporary postbiblical Judaism as a heretical departure from the biblical norm-vehemently advocated that clerics study Hebrew and use rabbinic sources in preaching to the Jews. Raymond opened a number of schools for training mendicant friars in Hebrew, and Pablo Christiani and Raymond Martini, his two best-known disciples, both based their polemics against the Jews on the premise that rabbinic texts bespoke the truth of Christianity.42 Most significantly, as the church grew more conscious of the complex linkage between its attitude toward Judaic learning and its treatment of the Jews, it began to voice concern over this troublesome relationship. The Summa theologiae attributed to Alexander of Hales weighed the evils of the Talmud against the positive testimonial function served by the Jews' presence in Christendom. "Since they must observe the doctrine of that book as law," the treatise concludes, "their books, in which blasphemies are contained, are to be burned"-although the Jews and their legitimate Old Testament rites did warrant toleration.43 Later in the 1240s, when the Jews protested to the papacy over the ecclesiastical attack on the Talmud, the key issue set the alleged postbiblical-and therefore heretical-nature of rabbinic literature against the Christian duty to endure the survival of biblical Judaism. Popes Gregory IX and Innocent IV had deemed the Talmud a distortion of Judaism and had consigned it to the flames. As a result, Innocent later recounted to Louis IX of France, the Jewish masters of your kingdom recently asserted before us and our brothers, that without that book which in Hebrew is called "Talmut," they cannot understand the Bible and their other statutes and laws in accordance with their faith; we then, bound as we are by the divine command to tolerate them in their Law, thought fit to have the answer given them that we do not wish to deprive them of their books if as a result we should be depriving them of their Law." Innocent added that he had designated the chancellor of the University of Paris, Eudes of Chateauroux, to inspect rabbinic books, and "of these he should tolerate such as he will find may be tolerated, in accordance with the [aforementioned] 42 Cohen, The Friars and the Jews, 62, n. 20, 103-69, and "The Jews as the Killers of Christ," 26. 43 Alexander of Hales, Summa theologiae, 2-2.161.1, 5 vols.

The language of this formal pronouncement was terse, but Eudes argued more discursively in an earlier letter responding to the papal demand for his investigation. The said books were full of errors, and . .. the veil covers the heart of these people to such a degree, that these books turn the Jews away not only from an understanding of the spirit, but even of the letter, and incline them to fables and lies. From this it is clear that the Jewish teachers of the Kingdom of France uttered a falsehood to Your Holiness and to the sacred fathers, the Lords Cardinals, when they said that without these books, which in Hebrew are called "Talmud," they cannot understand the Bible and the other precepts of their laws, in accordance with their faith.45 Despite recent scholarly protestations to the contrary, the charge of talmudic heresy-that the books under indictment obviatedJewish fidelity even to the letter of the Old Testament-remained at the heart of ecclesiastical concern, both during the thirteenth century and beyond.46 One must also note that Eudes did not rest with his summary condemnation of the Talmud and his insistence that it not be restored to the Jewish community. As chancellor of the University of Paris, he also supervised a massive effort by clerics to study the Talmud and present those of its contents with a potential interest to a Christian reader in a manner befitting his needs. The result was a written compilation over two hundred folio pages long, usually entitled Extractiones de Talmut, which first amassed in the order of their appearance some two thousand talmudic texts deemed noteworthy, then grouped them under thirteen subject classifications (for example, "Concerning the author- ity of the law which is called 'Talmud,"' "Concerning blasphemies against Christ and the Blessed Virgin," and so forth), and finally appended some shorter lists, " Solomon Grayzel, ed., The Church and the Jews in the XIIIth Century (rev. edn., New York, 1966), 275. 45 Ibid., 278-79 n.

Arguing that Innocent IV in 1247 dropped the charge of heresy from the papal opposition to the Talmud, Rembaum dismissed the significance of Innocent's own decretalist commentary-which rationalized the papal condemnations of the Talmud on the basis of its deviation from the Mosaic law-with the unconvincing suggestion that "it is possible that he formulated this statement on the basis of Gregory's bulls of 1239 and his own letter of 1244 prior to his being approached by the Jews in 1247." Ibid., 216 n. 81. Innocent wrote his commentary on the Decretales between 1246 and 1254. In the case of such an accomplished scholar, one may not assume that the final version of his work would have undercut the theoretical basis for his own actions only several years earlier.

See Kedar, "Canon Law and the Burning of the Talmud," Bulletin of Medieval Canon Law, 9 (1979): 78-83. And Rembaum overlooked the fact that the rationale of Innocent's commentary for the burning of the Talmud was echoed in the subsequent commentaries on the same decretal by Hostiensis, Joannes Andreae, and Franciscus Zabarella, by the fourteenth-century inquisitor Nicholas Eymeric, and by commentators at the court of the fifteenth-century antipope Benedict XIII.

Discoveries in the classroom demanded pack- aging that would facilitate their application in the world at large-in the case of the Talmud, to the pastoral interpretation of Scripture, the mendicant mission to the Jews, and thejustification for persecutingJewish books. As Richard Rouse and Mary Rouse have concluded, "Tools [which afforded easier access to important texts], mendicants, and (to a large degree) university are all responses to the same demand, the Church's need for a clergy properly trained and provided with the necessary books to preach and to minister to a Christian society."48 A sharp distinction between the utilitarian employment of Jewish exegesis and the tacit countenance of an inherently illegitimate rabbinic tradition also pervades the biblical commentaries of the Parisian master Nicholas of Lyra, whose academic career spanned the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. Nicholas accepted the Thomistic definition of the literal sense of the Old Testament as that which its writer consciously intended, but he argued that such an intention could indeed have been Christological. The primary meaning of the same biblical text could therefore include both historical and Christological dimensions.49 Through- out his postils, Nicholas drew extensively on the glosses of Rashi (Solomon ben Isaac of Troyes, 1040-1105) and on other rabbinic works. Yet, avoiding the logically problematic conclusions of earlier Hebraists, Nicholas did not entangle his knowledge of Hebrew in the a priori legitimization (whether expressed, implicit, or even unintentional) of the instruction of European rabbis. His Hebraica did not depend on theJews.50 He advocated and pursued Hebraic study The earliest extant copy of the Extractiones is in the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, lat. MS. 16558.

Rouse, Preachers, Florilegia, and Sermons: Studies on the Manipulus Florum of Thomas of Ireland (Toronto, 1979), 6-7. 4 See, for example, Nicholas's discussion of the biblical instructions for preparing the original paschal sacrifice; Postilla litteralis, on Exodus 12.1, 13.10, in Biblia sacra, cum glossis, 1: 145F-146B, 150GH: "One must understand the burning of the paschal lamb, as well as other sacrifices, in two respects. One concerns the [historical] moment, namely, the situation of the people departing from Egypt. The second is the signification (figuratio) of the lamb, designating the passion of Christ, which was prefigured in them [that is, the sacrifices]. The Apostle [Paul] accordingly states, 'Everything happened to them as a sign (in figura)' [1 Cor. 10:11]; and Rabbi Solomon states-and likewise the ancient Hebrew doctors-that all the prophets prophesied exclusively concerning the days of the Messiah. Therefore, since Moses was the greatest prophet, everything which he wrote is ordained for Christ; and as a consequence, there is a twofold meaning [duplex est sensus] in [the instructions for] offering the paschal lamb: One is the situation of the people departing from Egypt; this is literal and first [in time], and this I intend to explicate first. The other is the prefiguration of Christ who would someday suffer, and on this meaning I shall touch briefly at the end. For although this is last in chronological order, it is nevertheless primary in intention-like an objective, in relation to those things which have been ordained toward an objective [sicut finis respectu eorum, quae sunt ad finem ordinata]." The most extensive studies of Nicholas and his reliance on Hebraic sources remain those of Herman Hailperin. See Hailperin, Rashi and the Christian Scholars, esp. 184-91, "Nicholas de Lyra and Rashi: The Minor Prophets," in Rashi Anniversary Volume, American Academy forJewish Research Texts and Studies, vol. 1 (New York, 1941), 115-47, and "The Hebrew Heritage of Medieval Christian Biblical Scholarship," Historia Judaica, 5 (1943): 133-54.

One could no longer casually presume Jewish exegesis to be authoritative. In the prologue to his monumental Postilla litteralis, Nicholas decried the obfuscation of the literal understanding of Scripture in his day, which he attributed primarily to the errors of scribes and translators. "In order to attain the literal truth in the Scripture of the Old Testament, one must resort to the books of the Hebrews." In the same passage, however, Nicholas echoed the warning of Rufinus. "In this one must still be cautious indeed with regard to those passages in Old Testament Scripture which speak of the divinity of Christ and its consequences. TheJews have corrupted some of them in defense of their error." To his explanation for adducing the literalist commentaries of Rashi, "who among the Hebrew doctors has spoken most reasonably," Nicholas juxtaposed a reminder to his readers that absurd Judaic teachings ought not to be condoned.5' Rashi himself elicited rebuke from Nicholas for concealing the Christological truth of the Bible, and Nicholas typically substantiated his charges with references to other texts of presumably ancient Jewish interpretation that the medieval rabbi had deliberately abandoned. For example, to "the error of the Hebrews, who say that in these three chapters [of Isaiah], namely 7, 8, and 9, mention is not made of Christ," Nicholas responded, "In order to disallow this falsehood and to declare the truth, one must depend above all on the Aramaic translation [of the Old Testament] which among the Hebrews is called 'Targum' and is of such great authority among them that no one has dared to contradict it." Nicholas similarly cited the Septuagint to disclose Rashi's corruption of Isa. 9:5 and the glosses of Rabbi Moses ha-Darshan of Narbonne to refute Rashi's exegesis of Ps. 79. All of these sources, Nicholas believed, antedated the talmudic heresy.52 Rashi's "perversity" allegedly led him to self-contradiction in the understanding of Isa. 55:5. And, in his discussion of Ps. 2, Nicholas echoed the polemic of Herbert of Bosham; he indicted Rashi for Proceedings of the Rabbinical Assembly of America, 7 (1940): 223. Hailperin wrote that, even if "all the Jews in the world of that day were to have converted to Christianity, Christian scholars [that is, Nicholas] would not have ceased to deal with Hebraic studies and Hebraic culture in the least." 5' Biblia sacra, cum glossis, 1: 3GH. 52 Ibid., 3: 203FGH-204B, 4: 2 1 FGH, 24GH-25BCD. The notion that a full acceptance of Targumic interpretations of Old Testament prophecies would lead directly to Christianity still appears in modern Christian scholarship. See, for instance, Roger le Deaut, The Message of the New Testament and the Aramaic Bible (Targum), trans. Stephen F. Miletic, Subsidia biblica, vol. 5 (Rome, 1982), 43-55. "Frequently the Aramaic translations represent real theological progress (especially in so far as explicitation is concerned) when compared to the Hebrew text. As such, they form one stage towards the revelation of the New Testament." Deaut's disclaimer of sympathy with the medieval polemicists notwithstanding, he, too, suggested that rabbinic tradition deliberately suppressed Aramaic translations in early Jewish biblical interpretation and that these could have served to bring Jews closer to the church. "But the primary interest of the Aramaic versions is that they could be understood as a praeparatio evangelica ('preparing the way for the Gospel'). The best proof of their usefulness for understanding the content itself of the New Testament and Christian apologetics resides in the defiance and in the growing opposition of the Rabbis against this type of writing, leading to only one 'authorized' recension, which conformed to official teaching, namely the Onkelos translation of the Torah and the recension of Jonathan ben Uzziel for the Prophets."

Nicholas accord- ingly clarified and reiterated the warning of Richard of St. Victor against overestimating the reliability of Jewish biblical interpretation. The Postilla de- nounces Andrew of St. Victor for joining Rashi in his perversitas,54 chastises those Catholic doctors who, like Andrew, "Judaize" more than Rashi himself ("magis ludaizant quantum ad hoc, quam ipse Rabbi Salomo"),55 and even faults an interpretation of Thomas Aquinas for favoring the error of the Jews over the doctrine of the church.56 As Hebraist, commentator, and theologian, Nicholas succeeded not only in appropriating literalist exegesis from medievalJews but also in recognizing the ideological dangers in according their texts intrinsic value. IT IS INSTRUCTIVE THAT IN THE PERIOD of the most intense Christian study of Judaica new polemics undermined the security of EuropeanJewry. Whereas in the early medieval period ignorance of rabbinic teaching had perpetuated the nonaggressive AdversusJudaeos polemic of the church fathers, which was grounded in the notion of a Jewish religion that had remained stagnant and moribund since the first century, the growing interest in traditional Jewish learning ultimately led to disavowal of the old presupposition and its logical implications. A more direct and hostile type of polemic emerged, and alongside it a new Christian view of Jewish history, one that perceived a major qualitative transformation in the nature of Judaism and Jewish literature since the end of biblical times and the birth of Christianity. Such a schema underlay the novel idea of Thomas Aquinas and Nicholas of Lyra that first-century Jews actually recognized Jesus as Messiah and Son of God but spitefully killed him nonetheless. It facilitated the aggressive proselytizing of Raymond de Pefiaforte and his confreres, as evidenced in the monumental Pugio fidei of Raymond Martini.57 And, in terms of the new bifurcation between the literal truth of Scripture and the beliefs of contemporary Jews, this notion was expressed quite succinctly by William of Auvergne. In his De legibus, William first affirmed the primacy and authenticity of the literal-as opposed to the prefigurative-meaning of the Old Testament: 53 Biblia sacra, cum glossis 3: 88DEFGH, 4: 89H-90B. 54 On Isa. 53, see ibid., 4: 89FG. 55 On Ps. 44 (Ps. 45 in the Masoretic Text), see ibid., 3: 148FGH.

Concerning the nonmessianic, Jewish interpretation of Isa. 8:3, Nicholas reported: "Hoc dictum videtur sequi Thomas de Aquino in quadam postilla, quae sibi attribuitur tanquam ex eius dictis reportata, ubi solvuntur argumenta que solent fieri ad contrarium.... Hoc dictum videtur nimis favere errori Hebraeorum.... Solutiones Thomae ... non valent: quia falsum assumunt." For Aquinas's statement, see his In Isaiamprophetam expositio, 8. 1, in Stanislaus Eduard Frette and Paul Myare, eds., Opera omnia, 34 vols.

And after the Christian Church was established, it was truly not necessary that the law speak to us figuratively, since the truth of the Gospel itself had come to us clear and unconcealed. So by all means it is necessary that such things [Old Testament precepts] had a literal sense. And it is most improbable that the entire Jewish nation, the people of the law-in which everyone, from the most distinguished to the most obscure, was trained in the law and studied it-for so many thousands of years, would not have detected such an error [that is, that they understood the law incorrectly]. Yet contemporary Jews, continued William, no longer understood this literal truth. If anyone should ask why the Jews themselves today do not accept what we have stated and written concerning the ostensive absurdities [of the truly rational Mosaic laws], we would respond that at the time of their enactment, [their reasons] were most apparent to the Jewish] sages. Yet this knowledge vanished from among the Jews, because of the passage of time, their suffering, their dispersion, and above all their neglect of the study of the law. Such neglect was caused in part by the greed to which they are certainly prone, and in part by the love of Gentile philosophy.58 In the high medieval academy, increased sfudy of a minority viewpoint led not to greater toleration but to greater bifurcation between the circumscribed value of such an outlook and its despised protagonists. Twelfth- and thirteenth-century scholars may well have refined numerous hermeneutic techniques in pondering the significative character of theological language. Yet, as G. R. Evans has noted in a recent monograph, modern standards of textual criticism eluded them, inasmuch as their reading of a text still had to fit the predetermined mold of their theology. Modes of interpretation may have changed, but not the fundamental doctrinal assumptions that antedated them.59 For the medieval Jew, the results were dire. As Scholasticism facilitated an understanding of his books, it nearly eliminated his theologically grounded utility in European Christendom. 58 William of Auvergne, De legibus, chap. 15, in Opera omnia, 2 vols.
