<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joseph Brodsky's Roman Body TIMOTHY P. HOFMEISTER In "Letter to Horace," an essay published in the year before he died, Joseph Brodsky, or his narra- tor, describes an erotic dream-encounter with a strange body that resembles a lover's he once knew in Rome. This body represents Roman poetry, whose appeal lies in its formal excellence and histor- ical importance, but especially Horace's, which attracts Brodsky because of its metrical variety. Ho- race stands out for his power to surprise a reader through the manipulation, or recreation, of lan- guage. Brodsky's account of Horace's poetry (as well as of Virgil's and Ovid's) advances a set of ideas that appear in his other writing: that language issues from the inanimate; that a poet does not select from language so much as language chooses a poet, "and thereby accomplishes world-his- torical (evolutionary) goals of its own;" that the fruit of this evolution is beauty; and that lyric po- etry is "a metaphysical affair whose goal is either accomplishing or liberating one's soul: winnow- ing it from the chaff of existence." T body in question-the "Roman body" of Joseph Brodsky-appears in a dream Brodsky describes in "Letter to Horace," an essay he wrote in 1995, the year before he died.1 In the essay, Brodsky addresses Horace as if in an epistle, no Brief an einen jungen Dichter (Rilke), but instead a letter to a dead poet, except that Horace may not be a dead poet. In "Letter to Horace," Brodsky suggests that poets may be reincarnated, in Pytha- gorean fashion, and that Horace himself had recently returned as W. H. Auden, a mentor of Brodsky's. (One might think this is a tongue-in-cheek suggestion, except that a motif of reincarnation, or of the reformation of matter, already bruited in "Homage to Marcus Aurelius" [1994], for example, as a universal nature reshaping a universal substance, be- comes a highly significant theme of "Letter to Horace," as will be seen later in this essay.) At minimum, Brodsky insists, poets live on in their work, especially in the meters they use and the rhythms they create. In the dream which is the central figure of "Letter to Horace," Brodsky is making love with somebody-some body. This body represents the poetry of Horace, his body of work, but also Roman poetry as a whole, of which Horace's poems are a choice part, and so the dream signifies Brodsky's desire for the body of Roman poetry and of Horace's po- etry as well. Brodsky desires to flirt with that poetic body, even to make love or enjoy in- tercourse with it: to play in its meters and on its favorite themes, and, while indulging his I would like to thank the editor, Professor Wolfgang Haase, for his consistent helpfulness and advice, and also an anonymous reader for the Journal who gave generously of his/her keen insights in a response to an earlier draft of this essay. 1.

Brodsky figures poetic imitation as erotic struggle, in which the poet-as-lover is by turns either secondary or striving for transcendence. Such is the relation Brodsky traces in "Letter to Horace"-as well as ear- lier in "Roman Elegies" and "Homage to Marcus Aurelius"-to the classical, i.e., Roman poets, and to their city, Rome itself. Hence, Joseph Brodsky's "Roman Body." I will return in a moment to Brodsky's dream and "Letter to Horace." First, however, I would like to sketch (briefly) the ideas which Brodsky attempts to tie together in the essay and which inform his treatment of Horace and certain other Roman poets there. The dream and the essay as a whole elaborate certain essential themes of Brodsky's work: the relationship of a poet to poetic tradition(s), as well as the relation of the poet to lan- guage, to matter, and to time. Not to mention the soul. No wonder that J. M. Coetzee calls "Letter to Horace" "the finest essay in the collection" of On Grief and Reason, and one in which Brodsky's critical prose "attains new and complex, bittersweet tones."2 Brodsky's pursuit of this Roman body signifies the importance of Roman poetry, es- pecially that of Horace, within a European poetic tradition such as Brodsky conceives it. As he states in "Letter to Horace," ". . . when one writes verse, one's most immediate au- dience is not one's own contemporaries, let alone posterity, but one's predecessors. Those who gave one a language, those who gave one forms."3 The matter of language is com- plicated because Brodsky was a bilingual poet, so that "those who gave one a language" would entail at once a Russian tradition and an English tradition. "Those who gave one forms" would involve the same sort of broad tradition of poetry, in Russian and English, but would also feature Roman poets prominently, and indeed Roman culture as a whole. The Romans provided Brodsky himself, from his youth, with a feeling for artistic form. The city where Brodsky grew up, St. Petersburg, was, as Brodsky writes in his essay on Osip Mandelstam, "the mediastinum" of a Russian "Hellenicism," i.e., a Hell- enizing tendency that in fact represented an imagined cultural unity emanating from the West and, in practice, an "intellectual voracity toward anything coming from that direc- tion."4 Just as Mandelstam's poetry "repeats the development of our civilization," so the "Hellenicism" of St. Petersburg was inclusive of all that is classical-Hellenic, Roman, and Byzantine. As Brodsky put it, "Classicism never had so much room, and the Italian architects who kept being invited by successive Russian monarchs understood this all too well."s This profound classical exercise deeply impressed Brodsky, no doubt, so that the sensitivity to architectural form in "Roman Elegies" (not to mention "Homage to Marcus Aurelius" or Watermark) settles an old debt. The significance to Brodsky of classical poetic form is revealed in Brodsky's essay on Thomas Hardy, when he says that form, or "structuring," "reflects not so much [Hardy's] familiarity with the contemporary scene as... his reading of the Greek and Roman clas- sics."6 Brodsky notes with approval that Hardy was an autodidact-not surprisingly, see- ing that Brodsky was one himself. Brodsky also shows an interest in specific poetic forms that were adopted and developed by Roman poets, a good example being epigram, uti- lized by Brodsky in "Letters to a Roman Friend," which he inscribed to Martial. 2.

Coetzee takes Brodsky to task for the ob- scurity of this notion. It is perhaps true that this "restructuring" is not just a matter of dis- placing and rearranging time as it is experienced by a reader, by means of meter and rhythm; as Coetzee says, music does this more effectively than poetry.7 But poetry has words, while music does not utilize words, at least intrinsically. A poem, as Brodsky puts it, "is as incurably semantic as it is incurably euphonic."8 Brodsky insists on the music of language, and so it is for Horace's metrical variety in particular that Brodsky values Ho- race. Horace's euphonic inventiveness kindles Brodsky's ardor for the Odes. Brodsky makes the point in a poignant way when he writes that, if in Hades the language barrier between himself and Horace should prove insuperable, they might communicate by tap- ping out asclepiads and sapphics, "like inmates in an institution."9 The power of poetry to "restructure time" has a diachronic or evolutionary dimension. In "Letter to Horace," Brodsky reworks a crucial (and difficult) nexus of ideas which ap- pear elsewhere in his writing: that language issues from the inanimate; that a poet does not select from language, but language chooses the poet, "and thereby accomplishes world- historical (evolutionary) goals of its own," as Coetzee himself writes;'0 that the chief fruit of evolution is beauty; and, finally, that lyric poetry is "a metaphysical affair whose goal is either accomplishing or liberating one's soul: winnowing it from the chaff of existence."" 1It may seem presumptuous to speak of the soul (though Brodsky often does); one may prefer the way David MacFadyen summarizes what Brodsky is looking for in (and through) po- etry: "If there is a base, or basis, to all [of Brodsky's] switching, wandering, and vagrancy it is the ongoing search of the finite, physical world for the ineffable Word--the ethical duty to realize one's metaphysical potential in the here and now, in preparation for the "there and then. [. . .] It is the challenging of one's mathematically inevitable demise at the hands of linear history by creating a unique and idiosyncratic temporal mosaic, one that is beauti- ful and therefore improves the future, long after one has left it."12 MacFadyen's account of Brodsky's poetry-making brings us back to Horace, inasmuch as the image of "a unique and idiosyncratic temporal mosaic" recalls Friedrich Nietz- sche's often quoted description of the Odes as a supremely affecting "mosaic of words": Up to the present no poet has given me the same artistic raptures as those which from the first I received from an Horatian ode. In certain languages it would be absurd even to aspire to what is accomplished by this poet. This mosaic of words, in which every unit spreads its power to the left and to the right over the 7.

To be sure, Brodsky's personal experience of the Soviet prison system informs this ref- erence to the tapping of messages "like inmates in an institution." Brodsky also uses the con- dition of prisoners in his play, Marbles (1989), as a metaphor for the confinement of two char- acters, Tullius and Publius, within a totalitarian future, or alternatively in a restrictive poetic tradition burdened by the "marbles" of a classical past. 10.

In the Odes, Horace created an extension of himself into the future, what Nietzsche calls "the 'aere perennius' in style." While Brodsky never cites Nietzsche's famous description in "Letter to Horace," nevertheless it is clear that for Brodsky the Odes represent a restructuring of time in that precise sense, namely, of something uniquely beautiful which participates in the evolutionary goal of language itself and which thus affects the future more surely and profoundly than a physical monument. In "Homage to Marcus Aurelius," Brodsky points out how a monument scarcely departs from the "horizontality" it shares with "its most frequent subject," a human being. So Horace in the capstone ode (111.30), from which Nietzsche quoted "aere perennius," calls his poetry a monument higher than the pyramids, "regali situ pyramidum altius," and pre- dicts that it will live for as long as the pontifex "with the silent vestal climbs the Capito- line"-which turned out in fact to be an understatement, as Horace may have intended. Rome, or at least its imperial practices, reassumed the horizontal before Horace's poetry. In truth, poetry can accomplish a reversal of space as well, since that is what Brodsky calls the body, and poetry makes for Horace a more durable body than the one he ac- quired at birth. Similarly Brodsky's "dream" is an extension of reality, achieved through a response to a prior work of poetic art, or to a body of work, though rendered in a differ- ent medium, prose. Notwithstanding this difference in form, "Letter to Horace" repre- sents an opening of the poet's own self to the opportunity-or necessity, as Brodsky would probably have it--offered by language, and by its chief accelerator, poetry, to ex- tend reality and "improve the future." Brodsky tells Horace that the dream was precipitated when he read the Odes in bed late one cold February night. Reading the Odes triggers the recollection of a young woman Brodsky once knew in Rome. The erotic memory both causes and interacts with the dream, so I will describe each one briefly. Brodsky recalls that his young Roman "beauty" had an apartment in the Subura, "bristling with flowerpots but redolent with the smell of the crumbling paperbacks the place was stuffed with." The books belong not to the beauty, but to a neighbor, "an old woman, a widow, who was born and spent her entire 13.

The paperbacks surround the bed where the young beauty and Brodsky make love. The poet also recalls "a large, heavily framed mirror leaning somewhat precariously against a rickety bookshelf right across from the bed, and at such an angle that whenever I or my tender companion wanted to imitate you, we had to strain and crane our necks rather desperately. Otherwise the mirror would frame only more paperbacks. In the early hours it could give one an eerie feeling of being transpar- ent." ("To imitate you" refers to the story in the Suetonian vita that Horace's bed was sur- rounded with mirrors.)14 So much for the setting of Brodsky's reminiscence. In the dream that seems to issue from this recollection, everything stays the same, except that the books are gone, and the mirror, along with the lover as well. There is still the bed, however, and next to it a "sea- serpent-like, though extremely dusty radiator." Here is what transpires in Brodsky's "highly carnal" dream: ... To condense the entire endeavor into one cameo, my target's upper torso would be plunged into the narrow, one-foot-wide trough between the bed and the radiator, with the tanless rump and me atop it floating at the mattress's brink. The bodice's laced hem would do as foam. Throughout all this I didn't see her face. For the above-implied reasons. All I knew about her was that she was from Leptis Magna, although I have no idea how I learned this. There was no sound track to this session, nor do I believe we exchanged two words. If we did, that was before I became cognizant of the process, and the words must have been in Latin: I have a faint sense of some ob- stacle regarding our communication. Still, all along I seem to have known, or else managed to surmise in advance, that there was something of Ingrid Thulin in the bone structure of her face. Perhaps I espied this when, submerged as she was under the bed, her right hand now and then, in an awkward backward mo- tion, groped for the warm coils of that dusty radiator.'5 The lover has merged with the widow, the Beloved with the Muse. The books are gone because they too have merged with the figure that combines beloved and muse; ex- perience is being transmuted into poetry, and Brodsky is in the process of adding to the sum of all those crumbling paperbacks. And why is the mirror gone? Brodsky indicates that the dream is more like metamorphosis, and so no longer merely a reflection, but an attempt to merge with a Golden Age, a body of poetry which he had pursued over a life- time of reading. What more does the elusive body signify, if the image is not simply chic and sala- cious, like one of the quirky pictures of Guy Bourdin?'6 How does that body, and the 14. LH 431.--Cf.

Brodsky identifies the "tanless rump," the "target" of his affections in the dream, with Horace's verse, and strangely enough Brodsky has poetic metres in mind. Horace's metrics stand out from the body of Latin poetry just as the tan- less part of Brodsky's dream-beauty stands out from the rest of her form, which is terra- cotta colored and sepia-tinted. Brodsky calls the quality he prizes in Horace's metres "lo- gaoedic." By that term, he seems to mean the assimilation of dactyls (and spondees) to trochees, which creates an effect of metrical variety or surprise, as opposed to the monot- ony of the hexameter or the elegiac couplet. The term "logaoedic" also suggests a form of expression straddling the boundary of poetry and prose-"the verses, having the ap- pearance of metrical irregularity, partake of the nature of ordinary conversational prose" (Beck)-a notion that particularly suits Brodsky, for whom the prose essay emerged as a major creative outlet late in his career. As for expert knowledge of Latin metrics, one as- sumes Brodsky had none, since he says more than once in the essay, "My Latin stinks." (Brodsky mentions that he is reading the Odes in a Russian translation, and whether or not that translation happened to reproduce at all closely the metres of Horace, I do not know.) Horace's meters forestall routine, while those of Virgil, e.g., are too predictable, and repetitious--every bit as much as reality itself. The right hand of the lover, which reaches awkwardly for the radiator, represents an unfortunate wish to submit to the monotonous rhythm of the hexameter-what Horace does in his other poetry, Brodsky complains, whereas in the Odes, Horace strains instead for the unexpected, rhythmically speaking, and so retains the power to surprise a reader. To identify an example of this kind of surprise in the poems of Horace, one need only turn to the poem which Brodsky highlights in "Letter to Horace," the Valgius ode (2.9). In that poem, for instance, Horace uses enjambment in the third stanza to emphasize the placement of Mysten ademptum: "tu semper urges flebilibus modis/Mysten adempturm." Or take an example from another poem, the ode to Postumus (2.14), which Brodsky seems to favor, inasmuch as he alludes to it extensively in "Letters to a Roman Friend." In the penultimate stanza of the ode, the word "uxor," which is the complement of the adjective "placens," is delayed: Linquenda tellus et domus et placens uxor I.] Whether or not a Roman reader would have expected anything other than "wife" at the end of that ascending series, "You will have to leave behind your grounds and your house and your pleasing/wife" (not to mention what Postumus expected), one can be al- and wall. The similarity to the figure in Brodsky's dream is striking. I do not want to press the comparison, however, but only to acknowledge a marked feature of Brodsky's style in the essay "Letter to Horace" that is typified not just by the voyeuristic quality of the dream, but also in the repeated references to film and the movies--e.g., James Mason, Anthony Perkins, Ingrid Thulin. The erotic is not the salient feature, or not the only one, but rather the mixing of high and low, a free-ranging attitude that conveys a certain tone and a certain Euro-American intellectual style, a kind of Sontag-strut, even as Brodsky is discussing the "pearls of Horace." This is redolent of what Derek Walcott says of Brodsky's approach to the classics, "He chews and swallows the past audibly ... but of course this vulgarity is an act" ("Magic Industry," in Walcott's collection of essays, What the Twilight Says [New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1998], 140).</page><page sequence="7">Hofmeister 87 most sure what Brodsky would have been waiting for-"girl," "darling," or the like- and what pleasure he obtained when that expectation was overturned by the surprise of "uxor." Horace may indeed be capable of producing more subtle effects by means of rhythm and structure than Brodsky gives him credit for-not that Horace does not also create surprise by manipulating sense in other ways.17 Brodsky claims to be flattered that Horace mentions "Geloni" and "'mare Caspium" in his poem to Valgius, and this is not entirely a joke. But Brodsky winds up by saying that Horace wanders north in this poem just to say "Gelonos" and "Caspium" for the sake of another addressee than Valgius, namely, Augus- tus, whom Horace seeks to gratify by means of geography. In this way, Brodsky suggests, the "Geloni" become an emblem of the limits of Horace's imagination. However, Horace's reference to the Geloni, and his handling of form in this poem, is more expressive than Brodsky explicitly acknowledges. The Alcaic stanza tapers in the fourth line, and so the poem to Valgius narrows at its end, until the Geloni are trapped inside bounds that are shaped formally and metrically--exiguis equitare campis. But the reference may not be to Scythian horsemen so much as to certain poets who are Horace's contemporaries, in par- ticular elegiac poets, even Valgius himself, in whose case the constriction of poetic limits finally produces tedium: "tu sewmper urges flebilibus modis/Mysten ademptum." By contrast, a poet like Horace is able to turn "limits" into a virtue-a logaoedic poet, that is, as Brod- sky calls Horace.'s None of this flatters Virgil, at least initially. The radiator reminds Brodsky of Roman poetry of the hexametric type, its serpent-like coils representing, it would seem, the ser- pents who crushed Laocoon and his sons just as utterly as monotone reality overwhelms every living thing. But there is a side of Virgil which Brodsky admires, not the poet of the Aeneid, but of the Bucolics and in particular the Georgics. Brodsky likes the neutrality of the poetic voice in the Georgics, and the meticulous way the poet "has itemized the world." According to Brodsky, it is the absence of fiction which echoes "time's own per- spective" on existence. If time should have "pen of its own and decide to compose a poem," Brodsky says, "its lines would include leaves, grass, earth, wind, sheep, horses, trees, cows, bees. But not us. Maximum, our souls."19 The poet performs at least two im- 17. Brodsky does not attribute to euphony all of Horace's ability to surprise. Speaking at one point in the voice of Horace's Greek lyric predecessors, Brodsky says, "Yeah, we're impressed. That's why your lines are so twisted with enjambments and qualifiers, that's why your argu- ment is so unpredictable" (LH 440). One should not assume, having read in "Roman Elegies" the phrase, "cold pearls of Horace," that Brodsky failed to see that Horace knew, like Thomas Hardy, how to "roughen" a line in order to impart to the poetic argument an unpredictable turn. Such roughening appears in 3.6, the last Roman ode, when Horace anticipates the good offices of the institor in the seduction of the young Roman wife. The invocation of Libitina in the great capstone ode, 3.30, is another such stroke. There is also a superb example in 4.13: "Quid habes illius, illius,/quae spirabat amores,/quae me surpuerat mihi . . .?" ("What do you still retain of that one, that one who breathed love itself, who stole me from myself?") The collo- quialism of surpuerat represents a shift from formal diction, as if the speaker were to shed pom- posity for a moment, becoming least himself, i.e. his public self, and thus vulnerable, even in addressing that old love, Lyce. 18.

Virgil accomplished the first task, and the sec- ond as well, with some regularity: Whether he talks of plants or planets, soils or souls, the deeds and/or destinies of the men of Rome, his close-ups are both blinding and binding; but so are things themselves, dear Flaccus, aren't they? No, your friend was no atomist, no epicurean; nor was he a stoic. If he believed in any principle, it was life's regen- eration, and his Georgics' bees are no better than those souls chalked up for sec- ond corporeality in the Aeneid.20 Brodsky criticizes the use Virgil made--or, really, did not make--of this "second corpo- reality." Brodsky is referring to the famous passage in Book Six of the Aeneid, where Ae- neas witnesses the souls who are about to return to earth as the progeny of Anchises and Aeneas, and as a host of celebrated Romans. He cannot forgive Virgil for wasting such a stunning idea on "Augustus' pedigree," "blow[ing] it all for the sake of Caesar's lineage."21 For Brodsky, political insecurity-he speaks with some authority on this topic-got in the way of Virgil's metaphysical instinct. And so it is that, at the expense of Virgil (and of Horace as well), Brodsky names Ovid as the best poet of all, since, in Brodsky's view, it was Ovid who had vision (or imagination) surpassing that of Ho- race, or that of Virgil, who "was more curious about Caesar's sentimental property ... than about his territorial conquests." Ovid's poetry tells the truth about both matter and spirit. To put it bluntly, Naso insists that in this world, one thing is another. [...] His game was morphology, and his take was metamorphosis. When the same sub- stance attains a different form. The main thing is the sameness of substance. And, unlike the rest of you, he managed to grasp the simple truth of us all being composed of the stuff the world is made of. Since we are of this world. So we all contain water, quartz, hydrogen, fiber, et cetera, albeit in different proportions. Which can be reshuffled. Which already have been reshuffled into that girl. Small wonder she becomes a tree. Just a shift in her cellular makeup. Anyhow, with our species, shifting from the animate to the inanimate is the trend.22 This represents profound insight into the ultimate interests of the Metamorphoses. Italo Calvino came to the same conclusion, interestingly, naming as the principal theme of Ovid's long poem "the contiguity of all the figures and forms of existing things, anthro- pomorphic and otherwise": "Fauna and flora, mineral kingdom, and firmament embrace within their common substance what we are accustomed to think of as human, in the sense of an aggregate of bodily, psychological, and moral qualities."23 In Brodsky's ver- 20.

Brodsky insists in the Hardy essay (which is entitled, "Wooing the Inanimate," by the way), "that language flows into the human domain from the realm of nonhuman truths and dependencies, that it is ulti- mately the voice of inanimate matter, and that poetry just registers now and then its ripple effects."24 Language emanates from the inanimate, as Brodsky would have it, and that lan- guage speaks through poets, who Brodsky insists are not different from anyone else, ex- cept for the fact that in them the processes of language are greatly accelerated. Poets con- tribute to an evolutionary growth of the inanimate into language-an idea that Brodsky's friend, Derek Walcott, captures in the line, "too slow the stones crawling toward language every night."25 What is the point of this evolutionary process? Brodsky offered an expla- nation in "An Immodest Proposal": The purpose of evolution, believe it or not, is beauty, which survives it all and generates truth simply by being a fusion of the mental and the sensual. As it is always in the eye of the beholder, it can't be wholly embodied save in words: that's what ushers in a poem, which is as incurably semantic as it is incurably euphonic.26 Near the end of "Letter to Horace," Brodsky tells Horace that Ovid nearly put all fu- ture poets out of business in his tale of Narcissus and Echo, where sound and sight, "the mental and the sensual," semantics and euphony, are nearly fused. Brodsky thanks God for the "hexametric inertia" that kept Ovid off, and he is also grateful that the myth in- sists "on keeping eyesight and hearing apart."27 As it is, no poet can hope to succeed in fusing vision and meter-when that will finally happen, apparently, it is for language it- self to decide. And yet, since poets serve language, Brodsky seems to insist that poets will continue trying to do just that. If the foregoing gives some idea of the value Joseph Brodsky placed on the Roman poets and how he read them, yet it might occur to someone to ask, "Where are the Greeks?" Indeed, Russian poets of Mandelstam's era considered the Greeks a vital source of inspiration, a fact indicated plainly by the titles of the Acmeists' journals, Apollon and The Hyperborean.28 That is why Brodsky is not merely joking about Horace's mentioning his people and his country, when Horace wrote "Gelonos" and "Caspium." There is a mu- tual benefit, furthermore, in Horace's having recognized the Hyperboreans and Scythi- ans in his poetry. It means that one of the "fathers" of a great European tradition took no- tice of a Russian milieu, admittedly in a proto-stage-a highly significant fact, given that Russian poets for a century or two have shown a great interest in positioning themselves vis-a-vis a European tradition.

This early awareness of a "tadpole" Russian culture benefits Horace in turn, by making him appear as mantic, and gifted with the kind of imagination Brodsky promotes as a chief measure of poetic greatness. Brodsky wrote of Mandelstam that he went through a Greek period before entering into a Roman one: "[t]oward the twenties, the Roman themes gradually overtake the Greek and biblical references, largely because of the poet's growing identification with the archetypal predicament of 'a poet versus an empire.'" Brodsky himself seems to have skipped the Greek stage altogether, and to have proceeded straight into a life-long culti- vation of Romanitas. One explanation of this preference would surely be that Brodsky himself experienced that Roman predicament of "a poet versus an empire."30 Also, though Brodsky by no means keeps to a single poetic form, there is something quintes- sentially epigrammatic in Brodsky's style, as the inscription to Martial of "Letters to a Roman Friend" signifies. But it must also be reckoned that Brodsky felt himself to be a European and, given the central role Italy played in the cultural formation of Europe, es- pecially in the dissemination of classical culture, Italy loomed large in Brodsky's think- ing. The "Roman Elegies" witness to the fact. Brodsky spoke of these poems as a dialogue of north and south,31 very much after Goethe, but also clearly a dialogue between the north and south of Brodsky's own aesthetic sense and of his poetic soul. It is in keeping with this attraction to Italy that, having spent a good deal of time in Venice during the last part of his life, Brodsky should choose to be buried there. This is not to say that the Greeks are wholly absent from Brodsky's poetry. There are Greek themes in his work, as for example in "Daedalus in Sicily"32--though even with this poem it is difficult not to hear a Roman voice, Ovid's or Virgil's, while one is reading. If one were earnest about the search, one might reconsider all the mentions of Pythagoras in "Letter to Horace." Certainly these references, together with Brodsky's claims about reincarnation and "second corporeality," need not seem merely outlandish, in view of the theme that Brodsky highlights in Ovid, which is the same one Calvino did: "the contigu- ity between all the figures and forms of existing things, anthropomorphic and otherwise." Another important figure for Brodsky is Orpheus, who is indeed not unrelated to Pythagoras and the motif of a "second corporeality"-Orpheus is the archetype of the poet who defeats, or at least resists death. Through the power of his poetry Orpheus is able to animate nature, even the very stones, an emblematic moment that Brodsky would probably read as an inversion of reality, insofar as it is the inanimate, in his view, which animates an Orpheus. Though one doubts whether Brodsky knew that Orpheus was credited in late antiquity with a poem called Lithica (a work, admittedly, that reveals little of Orphic doctine), yet it is telling that Brodsky begins his poet's autobiography in "Let- ter to Horace" with the story of how as a young man he took part in a geological survey of the Caspian region. At the end of "Roman Elegies," Brodsky pictures a sad-looking Orphean figure, shuffling "across the frozen/Tanais"-there is the ancient premonition of Russia, again- "dropping from the picture, limping,/occiputs covered with wilted laurels, and bliz- zards' powder-/toward Time[.]"33 Brodsky's Orpheus performs a catabatic feat made 30.

He is a stirring figure, though he is limping and his laurels have wilted. And yet, this Orpheus is, after all, more Virgil's than any Greek's, insofar as he repeats the fading Orpheus of the last Georgic (4.517-20). Helleno-Roman or Romano-Russian, whichever this Orpheus might be, he acts and, finally, speaks as a poet after Brodsky's own heart. At the very beginning of "Roman Ele- gies" the poet declares his fate: Setting a naked foot on the rosy marble, The body steps toward its future: to its attire. If somebody shouted "Freeze!" I'd perform that marvel As this city happily did in its childhood hour. Throughout these elegies, the poet is inclining (or declining) toward the condition of stone. He finds "the sight of ruins" comforting; he hides "in the bowels of the Eternal City" and is loomed over by the Colosseum, "the skull of Argos." The "attire" of stone that represents death is consistently prefigured as bone, the human skeleton serving si- multaneously as the frame of the individual and his or her impending wreck. The poet does not despair, however, but becomes elated, strangely. In the Beloved he seems to in- timate the Muse--"Lesbia, Julia, Cynthia, Livia, Michelina"-in relation to whom he can sense an immortality.34 The poet fails utterly to escape the horizontal, just like any mon- ument, yet once again it is the intimation of a beauty that the inanimate achieves through language--and so through a poet-that provides a profound comfort. Better lean on a portico, loose the white shirt that billows, stone cools the spinal column, gray pigeons mutter, and watch how the sun is sinking into gardens and distant villas, how the water-the tutor of eloquence-pours from the rusted lips, repeating not a thing, save a nymph with her marble truants, save that it's cold and fresh, save that it's splitting the face into rippling ruins. The comfort is not total, it is true, or unambivalent. The coolness of stone that brings re- lief will turn to a chill; and the column of the spine suggests solidity, but also a future ruin. Likewise, as the poet leans against a portico, his shirt billows, which disrupts that momentary geometry; just so, the sinking sun brings the horizon-line down to a zero. The omen of "gray pigeons mutter" is also grim: faded color and the audible reduced to something unintelligible. Yet water is fluent, like time. It instructs the poet to accept 34.

Water and time teach that change is incessant-"repeating not a thing"-but it is not entirely so: repeating not a thing, save a nymph with her marble truants, save that it's cold and fresh, save that it's splitting the face into rippling ruins. The force of the inanimate, which registers for us as change, is "cold and fresh," yet it does not obliterate the poet, does not erase the human oval, but rearranges instead, or even renders the face as "an uncommon visage." It is the poet's task-aesthetic, also eth- ical-to accept this change as a freedom, and to accept along with it the quotient of beauty, small or not, that he is able to perceive amid the change. In Rome, the poet learns this les- son well. In "Homage to Marcus Aurelius," Brodsky discusses his feeling of being a copy in "the Eternal City," an inferior one at that, and though this platonic notion offers a sense of the beautiful, it also puts beauty nearly out of reach (IX). The poets of Rome faced this state of affairs, narrated it, if without explaining it (except for Lucretius), and its sages taught-or tried to-how one might cope with the fact of the embrace of materiality being at once so overly firm and yet, from one's mortal viewpoint, impermanent. Hence derives Brodsky's admiration of Marcus Aurelius, of his "acceptance of the perceptible reality" and his "serenity" (XVIII), the "postscript to passions" and "lack of illusion," (VIII) inscribed in the sculpted visage of his Campidolgio bronze. Hence, too, Brodsky's portrait of Orpheus-shuffling, limping, disappearing, "covered with wilted laurels and blizzards' powder- / toward Time." The voice that speaks in the next stanza of "Roman Elegies"-its final stanza-might well belong to Brodsky's shuffling, fading Orpheus: Lean over. I'll whisper something to you: I am grateful for everything: for the chicken cartilage and for the chirr of scissors already cutting out the void for me-for it is your hem. Doesn't matter if it's pitch-black, doesn't matter if it holds nothing: no ovals, no limbs to count. The more invisible something is, the more certain it's been around, and the more obviously it's everywhere. You were the first to whom all this happened, were you? For a nail holding something one would divide by two- were it not for remainders-there is no gentler quarry. I was in Rome. I was flooded by light. The way a splinter can only dream about. Golden coins on the retina are to stay- enough to last one through the whole blackout. Brodsky told Solomon Volkov that in writing this last line he had in mind Gennady Smakov, a friend of Brodsky's who had died of AIDS.35 The Orphean voice in this stanza, 35. Volkov, Conversations, 200. David Cronenberg, once asked whether his film, The Fly (1986), served as a metaphor of the AIDS epidemic, has said recently in a radio interview that he</page><page sequence="13">Hofineister 93 Brodsky's or Smakov's, does not bewail his fate, or betray fear of the blackness of death. The voice of the poet registers gratitude to its muse, whose hem is the void; at least the muse does that for its poet, i.e., give nothingness some shape, and in that regard a glint of meaning. Though the poet is headed toward the invisible, moreover, it is apparently not toward nothingness, since the "invisible" possesses duration on the one hand and ubiq- uity on the other. Once entered there, the poet is safeguarded by another kind of vision, one whose impressions on the retina remain alive, as in a dream. And the poet's ultimate word bespeaks the power to endure--"enough to last one through the whole black- out"-just like the Orphean head which, once struck to stone, never ceases its singing. responded that it served rather as a metaphor of the process of aging, inevitable and universal (NPR's Fresh Air, October 3, 2005). So it would seem that Brodsky here does the reverse, by in- scribing within an elegiac sequence which meditates on aging and mortality the particular loss of a beloved friend to AIDS.</page></plain_text>
