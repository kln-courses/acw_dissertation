<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Subject Medieval/Modern: Text and Governance in the Middle Ages. By Peter Haidu. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2004. xii + 446 pp. $65.00 (cloth); $27.95 (paper). "The modern subject was invented in the Middle Ages, such is the thesis of this book, destined to disturb medievalists and mod ernists (including postmodernists) alike" (1), Peter Haidu begins, going on to elaborate this claim over the long space of an introduc tion, fifteen chapters, and a conclusion. The "subject" at stake here is the category, collective or individual, invented by "literary" texts and historical practices as part of the political invention of the state. Medieval texts explore the phase of subjectivity that "encounters</page><page sequence="2">204 Book Reviews the demand of social action as the world springs the necessity of making choices - often binary and framed by external conjunctures over which the subject has no immediate control -on the individ ual. This is the necessity of narrative, slighted by the generations that, after May 1968, disengaged themselves from social action" (3). Thus does this politically committed book, by turns fascinating and frustrating, establish its jargon-laden and politically committed tone. Haidu paints with a very broad brush indeed, which serves his aims well when his large-scale themes take shape over the course of the book, but not when he turns to the particular literary and historical phenomena whose analysis is intended to support those arguments. In Chapter one's discussion of the Peace Movement, for instance, Haidu accuses Dominique Barthelemy of overlooking "the central fact of medieval society," that it "was a his torical society, with a division of labor reflected in its class struc ture" (19; my italics). So far, so fair. But he then invokes Georges Duby's interpretation of the crusade as an outlet for the knightly class's aggressivity, which had been suppressed by the Peace of God, which foreshadowed the generation of '68: it was "perhaps the first non-violent mass intervention in history since Aristophanes' Lysistrata" (31). Such a broad and romanticized view of this phe nomenon, asserted rather than argued, cannot acknowledge the uncomfortable fact that knights were not the only ones slaughtering Jews and Muslims, and that indeed the First Crusade might have begun as a populist movement (see Ward). Chapters three and four trace the development of the subject in various modes of vernacular discourse. Latin hagiography con demned the values of the laity, yet needed the vernacular to legiti mate the power of the monasteries, and thus "endowed [the laity] with the weapon of cultural independence" (54). According to chapter three, The Song of Roland desired the subjection of the nobil ity to the monarchy, but a lack of available cultural forms impeded a solution to the question of how this change was to be effected. The answer arrived subsequently in the guise of "the romance," which fused anthropomorphic representation and sequential logic. Chapter four notes that the love-lyric is a "political technology" insofar as it reverses social realities by positing the female as the subjugator; chapter five uses the romances of Chretien de Troyes to argue that it is in resisting any totalising identification "that the</page><page sequence="3">South Atlantic Review 205 active reader, tracking the author's structural paradoxes, discovers the form of subjectification that, twelfth century or twenty-first, characterizes the subject of freedom" (119). Since "Marie de France knew marginalization" (123) and cham pions the subaltern via her "postcolonial lais," she is inevitably a favorite of The Subject Medieval/Modern. Its villain is Christine de Pizan, who unhinges Haidu. I found parts of his discussion of Christine engaging and insightful, as when he compares her with Sandra Day O'Connor or Clarence Thomas, who "perform as pro gressive ideologemes - representation of women and blacks on the Court- while their pronouncements and votes are usually reac tionary" (312). But when he accuses Christine's reading of Jean de Meun of being superficial and opposed to common sense, he is grossly unfair. Haidu continually and correctly stresses the polyvo cality of medieval textuality -and, we should note, precisely what Christine was responding to when she accused Jean of hiding behind his characters - so it is a bit rich for him to accuse a medieval reader of "misinterpreting" the Rose. What is particularly distress ing is that this is one of the only places - surprisingly, in an avowedly Marxist study - where Haidu discusses contemporary responses to medieval writing; otherwise the literature at stake seems to have an existence, in some manner, entirely apart from its material or oral life in the Middle Ages. Other chapters consider Raoul de Cambrai; the Domesday Book and the idea of the survey; Guillaume de Lorris's Rose, which problema tizes the subject by fragmenting and fetishizing the object; Silence, which problematizes identity via its treatment of the nature/nur ture dilemma; the "Conges" of Arras, whose use of proper names works to construct a "radical individualism" (279; there is a great deal in Haidu's world that is "radical"); and various later French authors: Philippe de Beaumanoir, Alain Chartier, and Franqois Villon (a rogue, and thus a hero to Haidu). I doubt anyone will be disturbed by Haidu's claims that "the modern subject was invented in the Middle Ages" and do not see why he thinks this is so. Rhetorical gestures towards debates over periodization aside, this is a book for medievalists. Its major flaw, to my mind, is its neglect of the element on the other side of that slash in the title: Haidu takes "the modern subject" as a given, as if Marx and Althusser had established its definition adequately. Nor does</page><page sequence="4">206 Book Reviews he engage with recent debates about medieval/Early Modem peri odization that have focus precisely on "the subject" (Aers; Patterson). Moreover, the desire to establish beginnings for a given topic in one's own, earlier, period of study strikes me as a funda mentally conservative one, which must accept the terms of the debate at stake. That aside: why should it matter that the French Middle Ages invented the subject? Would the world differ very much had it been the late antique era, or the early German Middle Ages, or indeed the Modem era, that did so? Haidu does not explain. Perhaps, though, such questions would be more appropriate for other kinds of studies, ones not committed to legitimating the polit ical relevance of an area of study that many might dismiss out of hand. Despite my serious reservations about important aspects of its performance, The Subject Medieval/Modem is admirable in its con viction that literature and history are of urgent importance to us today, and in its commitment to a trans-historical approach to liter ature that draws upon a lifetime's work on the topic.
