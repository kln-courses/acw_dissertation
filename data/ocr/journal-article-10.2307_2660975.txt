Cambridge: Univ. Press, 1996. ?55.00 Primatologists who describe themselves as such implicitly assert that there is something special about primates that separates them from the rest of the animal kingdom. At present there is no 'ology' for the study of the great apes alone, yet a growing number of comparative psychologists are coming to feel that if there is a mental Rubicon in the animal kingdom it is not between mammals and primates, nor yet between humans and animals, but between the great apes (including ourselves) and the rest. Is this specialness of the great apes justified? Behaviourism held that 'rules of behaviour were universal, independent of the animal that enacted them: it was the cognitive revolution in 1960s' psychology which brought early ape research back into focus. But a new school of neobehaviourists questions that ape intelligence exceeds that of rats, let alone monkeys. Reaching into thought is the first edited volume entirely devoted to the cognition of the great apes. What does it add? The book is divided into two sections, the first devoted to reviewing the scope of ape intel- ligence (what problems they can solve) and the second to the organization of their intelligence (how problem solving is structured). A number of old favourites, including mirror self-recog- nition and tool use, make an appearance in considerably tightened-up experimental proce- dures. But there are also new developments: Juan Carlos Gomez contributes a nice chapter on how eye contact can be used not just to gather social information but to signify commu- nicative intent (dogs do not normally wink at their owners, for example). Sally Boysen reports on chimpanzees' success in mastering numbers. One unexpected and hilarious twist in this research is the liberating influence that symbolic processing has on real-world action. Chimps were given lengthy opportunities to learn a task in which they were required to point at one of two unequal portions of food, with the subject receiving the portion not pointed to. Time and again, chimps were entirely unable to resist pointing to the larger portion despite its being denied them. When Boysen removed the actual stimulus of food and replaced it with numbers representing food, the chimps immediately started pointing to the smaller numbers. Symbols calm you down! Ape language, the flagship of early ape research, is conspicuously absent. Instead a great many chapters are devoted to the phenomenon of imitation, once assumed a trivially common process in animals, now recognized empirically as extremely rare and suspected theoretically as one of the most fundamental forces in acquiring not only manual skills and social conventions but also an understanding of another's - and perhaps even one's own - mind. Cross-analysis of the apes' repertoire of mental feats charac- terizes the second section, which undertakes the difficult task of deciding which cognitive capac- ities are dependent on which others in principle and which are dependent in fact. Here, discussion is stimulating if not conclusive.</page><page sequence="2">110 BOOK REVIEWS On the whole, Reaching into thought is a persuasive case for recognizing important differences between monkey and ape. Are these greater than those between non-human great apes and ourselves? We must discard notions of separateness based on evolutionary pedigree, since humans are now known to be much more closely related to the chimpanzee than the chimpanzee to the gorilla. It then comes down to which psychological attributes constitute valid and non-anthropomorphic criteria for splitting up the animal kingdom. The theoretical depth of books such as this should help us resolve the question. T. SAMBROOK University of Durham</page></plain_text>
