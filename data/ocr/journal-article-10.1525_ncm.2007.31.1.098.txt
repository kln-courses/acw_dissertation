Our interests are as diverse as the long century itself. They cover music of any type or origin and include, but are not limited to, topics in composition, performance, social and cultural context, analysis, music theory, critical theory, hermeneutics, aesthetics, documentary, archival, and editorial study, gender and sexuality, history, and historiography. We also publish book reviews and welcome suggestions and proposals. Typescripts should be double spaced on 81⁄ 2 X 11-inch bond paper, with ample margins; three copies should be submitted. Endnotes, tables, captions, music examples, and texts for music examples should be written on separate sheets. All endnotes and extracts (citations) must be double-spaced. Typescripts should be sent to the Editorial Office, 19th-Century Music; Music Department, University of California, Davis; Davis, California 95616. Materials for review may be sent to the same address. Please do not submit articles by e-mail. Once an article is accepted and the text has been revised and agreed on in consultation with an editor, an attachment file will be requested by the editorial office. The Word file(s) should include all text (tables, captions, etc.) plus a one-page abstract, with five key words selected at its end. Music examples may be submitted as either hard copies (xeroxes acceptable) or .pdfs; camera-ready art may be sent as black and white glossies, or in electronic files—.tiff, .pdf., or .jpeg. For quotations transcribed from foreign sources, authors are urged to specify in the typescript occurrences of the following characters: ß, É, À, Œ, and œ. Prospective contributors should consult recent issues of 19th-Century Music or Writing About Music, by D. Kern Holoman (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1988), for matters of style. In most cases, we follow the practices of The Chicago Manual of Style, 15th edn. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003). 98 19th-Century Music, vol. 31, no. 1, p. 98.
