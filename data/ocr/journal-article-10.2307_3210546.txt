Levy and Jonathan Golden Syncretistic and Mnemonic Dimensions of Chalcolithic Art A New Human Figurine from Shiqmim 44/' ll? P EfligLll T~t~ 1-' ? ~ ARCHAEOLOGISTS DEAL WITH MATERIAL CULTURE OF THE PAST through systems of classification and typology. However, the categories we create are so frequently employed that they often begin to assume the appearance of a priori facts. This is perhaps why it is partic- ularly interesting when excavators discover an idiosyncratic artifact that seems to defy simple classification. This is the case with a small figurine unearthed during the 1993 exca- vations at Shiqmim, a large Chalcolithic (ca. 4500-3500 BCE) village and mortuary complex in Israel's northern Negev desert (Levy 1987,1995). Field work produced a small, human figurine, which on its own represents an exquisite object of art. But it is also unique for the Chalcolithic period: it is fash- ioned from bone, a material rarely used at that time for sculptures of any sort, particularly for human representations. What is perhaps most fascinating about this newly dis- covered object is that it reflects two distinct southern Levantine The newly discovered figurine stands a scant 9.52 cm tall. Excavators had originally placed it with the other bits and pieces of bone and tooth of the faunal sample. The human-shape carved cow scapula was rediscovered in the laboratory. Beyond its beguiling beauty, its uniqueness lies in its apparent synthesis of two different Chalcolithic artistic traditions, "abstract" stone, violin-shape figurines and more representational ivory statuettes.

In fact, until recently, the two separate categories of figurative art could only be related through various other types of well-known Chalcolithic arti- facts, e.g. both occur in association with basalt stands, v-shape bowls, cornets, and other objects. However, in addition to the new figurine from Shiqmim, recent discoveries at the Piqelin Cave indicate that the distinction between these two styles is beginning to break down. The discoveries point to 150 Biblical Archaeologist 59:3 (1996)</page><page sequence="2">r' ooe .. .... !. :.:...-..:. COO (I e C. ~ a a d **-.*...: 00 OO. ~ j oceoc e oe. o o 00 o~ ? Cii ". " '; ..

In the fol- lowing discussion, we attempt to understand this new figurine in terms of its place in the corpus of Chalcolithic figurines, particularly with regard to the apparent "bridge" it creates between the two local, yet separate styles. Moreover, in striv- ing to work toward an archaeology of late fifth-fourth millennium Levantine religion rooted in the scientific tra- dition and empirical methodology (cf. Alon and Levy, in prep; Renfrew 1995), we suggest that the new Shiqmim figurine points to previously unrecognized syncretistic and mnemonic elements in the cognitive systems of Chal- colithic societies. Description of the Figurine The newly discovered figurine' is carved out of bone, perhaps a scapula of a cow (Bos taurus) as suggested by the figurine's width and flatness as well as the shallow depres- sion running the full length of its back. The object is 9.52 cm tall and less than 1 cm thick. In profile it appears to have three planes: one from the very top of the head to the bottom of the nose, with a small bump for the nose; a second plane from the shoulder to the waist; and a third from the waist down. The figurine is complete except for the edge of left shoulder which appears to have been broken in antiquity. While the body of the figurine is more or less abstract with punctate decoration, the head (width = 1.64 cm) is mod- eled in some detail. The eyes are represented by two round 6 mm depressions, and its right eye still retains a round, pierced shell inlay. Two punctate marks just below the nose indicate the nostrils. No mouth is indicated, and there is no neck or limbs. The torso, which is 2.4 cm wide at the shoulders, tapers to 1.58 cm at the waist and is dotted with three vertical columns of seven punctate marks. The holes are ca. 2 mm in diameter, and form lines that are not precisely regular, as all three curve toward the right and then back just at the waist. A small bulge can be seen in the abdominal region, below which there are two more punctate marks. The lower portion of the body is 3.4 cm wide and recti- linear in shape, with hips that flare upward. This part of the body, like the violin-shape figurines, resembles the typ- ical Chalcolithic palette form, particularly in its rounded corners and slightly convex shape. Two horizontal rows of punctate marks, seven in each, one just below the other, occur just below the middle of this section. Two more horizontal rows of such marks dot the lower margin of the figurine, this time in rows of eight. The back of the figurine has no modeling, bearing only a series of scratches from the margin of the head in toward the neck at an angle of about 75 degrees. These scratches appear to be part of the manufacturing process, incurred when the figurine was crafted. Alternatively, the scratches may be utilization marks, reflecting how the figurine was used in antiquity. Context of the Artifact The Shiqmim Chalcolithic village and mortuary center are located ca. eighteen km west of the city of Beersheva along the north bank of the Nahal Beersheva. A regional survey of this drainage and the nearby lower Nahal Besor indicates that Shiqmim was the largest late fifth-fourth millennium village in this area and formed the apex of a two-tier settle- ment hierarchy reflecting a chiefdom level of social integration (Levy 1995). The site has produced evidence of metal working (Levy and Shalev 1989; Shalev and Northover 1987), subterranean architecture (Levy et al. 1991), pottery pro- duction (Levy and Menahem 1987), rectilinear architecture (Levy 1987), and other assemblages of artifacts. The Phase I excavations (1982-1984) focused on a broad horizontal expo- sure of the upper strata at the site. The Phase II excavation seasons (1987-1989, 1993) aimed at exploring the develop- mental history of the site from its earliest basal layers to its abandonment (Levy et al. 1991). The deep 1993 stratigraphic excavations at Shiqmim employed a new geophysical sur- vey instrument known as Geophysical Diffraction Tomography (GDT) to discover a wealth of previously unknown subter- ranean tunnel and room complexes (Witten et al. 1995; Levy et al. 1996). With the exception of a few intrusive Byzan- tine pits, the site existed entirely within the Beersheva Valley-Chalcolithic cultural horizon.

The majority of the Chalcolithic ivories discovered in Per- rot's 1950s excavations of nearby Safadi came from contexts such as pits in subterranean rooms. The Shiqmim figurine came from an open-air pit in Stratum IIa at the northern end of the village excavations. The pit possessed a diameter of nearly 1.5 m and was slightly more than 1 m deep with a vol- ume of ca. 1.7 m3.2 Along with the figurines, in the pit's ashy, silty fill, excavators retrieved a digging stick weight and a spindle whorl. While they also collected charcoal from the pit for C-14 analysis, due to the unusual circumstances by which the figurine was recognized (see acknowledg- ments), this organic material has not yet been submitted for study. The pit was situated near a rich complex of open-air and subterranean architecture. This location may provide a con- textual clue to the social setting in which the figurine played a role. The pit sat six meters northwest of a large rectilinear building (Room 13) which has been defined as a non-domes- tic, corporate building (Levy and Alon 1987; Levy et al. 1991). Immediately to the east of the pit was an unusually large bell-shaped silo, also dating to Stratum IIa, which presum- ably was used for grain storage. About 2.5 m to the west of the pit lay the opening to Subterranean Room 8, one of the latest underground structures to be radiometrically dated at the site (RT-1322, 5190 + 75 BP, 4212(3996) Cal BCE); Levy et al. 1991). This underground room contained numerous stor- age pits and grinding equipment. The architectural features in this part of the Shiqmim lower village imply that Sub- terranean Room 8 functioned as a public storage facility associated with Room 13. Like other corporate buildings at Shiqmim, Room 13 had a plastered white floor. It also con- tained two semi-circular stone-built installations along its south wall. The paucity of domestic artifacts and debris and its similarity in layout to the main temple building at En- Gedi (Ussishkin 1980) suggest that Room 13 was a locus of cult activities. It is not surprising to find such an anthropo- morphic figurine in a pit near corporate and storage facilities. 152 Biblical Archaeologist 59:3 (1996)</page><page sequence="4">' Gaza 7Gerar..LiI1 0 400 m Gilat 00o ZoumellrWx- O- Besor O 500 00 oV I e ' .P Arad Beer. 10 0 b LMatar0 m 0 0 S0m0 0 0 Zecelim 0 Shiqmim 20 m S afadi0 0 o 0o o -C es l Cesevaf Osnat Oo 400 m 0 k 06500 m i .. Shiqmin sat on the north bank of the Nahal Beersheva where it presided over the Chalcolithic settlement of the drainage system as its largest village. Different artistic traditions existed even within this relatively circumscribed cultural region. The new Shiqmim figurine creates a representational "bridge" between these different yet local styles. Chronological Considerations Before proceeding further with a comparative study of Chalcolithic figurines, a brief discussion of the chronologi- cal sequence from which they come is appropriate. A growing body of complementary data join together to fashion the fol- lowing thumb-nail temporal sketch for Chalcolithic settlement in the northern Negev. Gilat, which produced a small but significant component of late-Neolithic Wadi Rabah culture (ceramic sherds, Levy et al. in prep), represents the earliest Chalcolithic tradition under discussion. Despite evidence for cultic activities (Levy and Alon 1993 and references there) and intra-regional integration (Goren 1995), Gilat lacks a met- allurgical component. This absence may be chronologically significant. Based on the importance of metallurgy in Negev Chalcolithic economies (Levy and Shalev 1989; Shalev and Northover 1993) and given the range of symbolic and artistic artifacts found at Gilat, we would expect to find cop- per objects by the developed Chalcolithic. Copper metallurgy represents the hallmark of this genre. While the difficulties in using copper as an indicator of spatial and temporal rela- tions warrants a discussion of its own, it can be suggested here that the dearth of metal at Gilat, in contrast with the extensive evidence for metal production at Abu Matar, Bir- es Safadi, and Shiqmim conforms with the view of Gilat as an earlier site, with the Beersheva valley sites representing the more developed phase of the Chalcolithic. Radiocar- bon dates from Bir-es Safadi clearly indicate that occupation of this site is later than at Gilat (Joffe and Dessel 1995; Gilead 1994). Aside from Teleilat Ghassul, Shiqmim has the longest sequence of occupation for any of the southern Levantine Chalcolithic sites, and overlaps chronologically with both the earliest and latest Chalcolithic settlements in the north- ern Negev. Given this site chronology, we may propose a general sequence whereby violin-shape figurines, known primarily from Gilat, generally appear early in the Chal- colithic, while the ivory figurines of the Beersheva sites, are typical of the later phases of the period. Chalcolithic Artistic Traditions In general, Chalcolithic figurines can be divided into sev- eral distinct categories. For the present purposes we will restrict our discussion to two main groups of human Biblical Archaeologist 59:3 (1996) 153</page><page sequence="5">~,:i"=-r: ~x~;ot,?::? .' *' ? *r a, , -??i;t~~,px4- -rC. :' --i 1 J` J.- i r~f.i~: *rl"'"~ `-?

Levy. figurines because they are most pertinent to an under- standing of two particular objects from Shiqmim-the bone figurine published here for the first time and an anthropomorphic basalt statuette head reported some time ago (Levy and Alon 1985, 1987). Large statuettes such as the Gilat woman and ram are not included in the figurine category utilized here (Alon and Levy 1989). Ani- mal figurines and the small trapezoidal pendants with two holes pierced at the top, which may or may not be figurines, are also excluded. The first group, "violin- shape" figurines as they are commonly known, are generally flat, rectilinear, highly abstract figurines. They are most frequently made of stone, although there are rare examples of bone and ceramic materials which have been found at Gilat (Alon and Levy 1994). The second group relevant to this discussion com- prises a set of anthropomorphic ivories from the Beersheva sites of Abu Matar and Bir-es Safadi, in addition to one unprovenienced figurine, which have few similarities with the violin-shape genre. This latter group are mod- eled with much greater detail resulting in a more naturalistic, even exaggerated, human representation. The number of ivory figurines include two complete males (Perrot 1959:pl. ii; 1964:pl. li) and three heads (Perrot 1959:pl iii; 1964:pl. lii), as well as a female which is missing the head (Perrot 1959, fig. 1)-all from Bir-es Safadi. One example from Abu Matar represents the head and torso of a woman (Perrot 1955:pl. 22A), and one other example depicts a headless woman, who is considered to be pregnant (Perrot 1968). While its origin is unknown, one final ivory figurine of a rather fully sculpted woman with large breasts clearly belongs to this corpus of statuettes (Amiran and Tad- mor 1980:pl. 17:a-d). Some of the chronological problems related to the sites where these figurines originated were discussed above. At the same time, certain spatial and/or cultural factors also warrant mention. Evidence suggests that Gilat developed out of the local Wadi Rabah tradition, while the Beersheva SHIQMIM 1993 ' AREA D 1-"1"1 SERII.I-4 41 f ~?~cC~;-L4142 U L.-406U -- 41911 1711.07 L4 M%9 + l i 1.O 40"4 W171 L 41 94 171.74 17&amp;21 4 m.

At the same time, radiocarbon data indicates that Gilat and Shiqmim and perhaps the Beersheva sites were at least partially contemporaneous in the earlier phases. Thus, we see two distinct, yet related cultural traditions living no more than sixteen kilometers apart in the northern Negev. It is reasonable then to suggest that the roots of the Beer- sheva culture are ultimately to be found in that of Gilat whose material culture has its origins in the Chalcolithic assem- blages from Tuleilat Ghassul in the lower Jordan Valley (Levy et al., in prep). Furthermore, it is also interesting to consider 154 Biblical Archaeologist 59:3 (1996)</page><page sequence="6">I . r?~ - . r rs. Basalt statuette head previously found at Shiqmim. One of the so- called "Pinocchio" figurines, it represents another manifestation of the naturalistic modelling of the new figurine. Such modeling is also characteristic of the Beersheva ivories. The bone figurine's prominent nose and high orbits bring it into even closer contact with the basalt head.

Trade between the groups must certainly have gone beyond the objects that were exchanged, involving such social aspects as technological style, socioe- conomic values, and iconographic systems inextricable from the actual material goods. The ideological distinctiveness of these neighboring archaeological entities may also be reflected in the archaeozoological record from the region. As Grigson (1995) has shown, the people at Gilat consumed relatively large quantities of pig, whereas the Beersheva valley inhabitants ate none. More important, it is highly probable that human genetic material was exchanged through inter- marriage amongst these neighboring polities in the northern Negev. With social exchange comes the exchange of ideas, in this case, perhaps the systems of meaning and ideologi- cal beliefs embedded in the two artistic traditions seen in the different figurines. This series of exchange processes may have helped produce the syncretistic figurine described here. It was noted earlier that the violin-shape figurines, known also from Ghassul, Qatif, Nahal Besor, and other locales, are highly abstract, differing in several significant ways from the Beersheva valley figurines. Most obvious are differences in shape and the style of representation. In "typical" violin- shape figurines of the early Chalcolithic, the head and neck are stylized, represented only by a narrow, rectangular thin board (Alon and Levy 1989). Ivory statuettes from Safadi and Abu Matar, on the other hand, display human features which are in fact, exaggerated. For instance, several ivory figures recovered at Safadi and the Shiqmim basalt head, all bare rather large noses as well as large rounded eyes ( Per- rot 1959; Levy and Alon 1985a). Where rendering of the body is concerned, the violin-shape figurines depart even far- ther from naturalistic human representation in that they usually lack any features beyond highly stylized shoulders and waist. Figurines from Safadi and Abu Matar, on the oppo- site extreme, display not only all four limbs, but other naturalistic elements such as digits, and in some cases, breasts and genitalia (where preserved). In general, it can be said that the Beersheva figurines achieve three dimensional repre- sentation, while the violin-shape figurines, although sculpted in the round, are highly abstract, two-dimensional human symbols. What this means in terms of ancient belief systems is difficult to say. The classification and interpretation of these objects are important issues which must be addressed. The violin-shape figurines are, in fact, so abstract that in earlier research it was only with reference to Cycladic figurines that the Negev sculptures had been construed as representing the female body (Alon and Levy 1989:187; Renfrew 1991). While they have often been interpreted as representing female figurines or even fertility goddesses, it is no coincidence that the term, "violin-shape" figurines is more commonly used. However, the discovery of a large violin-shape figurine with breasts in the Gilat sanctuary complex (Alon and Levy 1994) and a small violin-shape figurine with breasts (Levy 1987:515) now safely links these objects with the female gender. Still, unlike the more anthropomorphic figurines from Bir-es Safadi and the Gilat Woman (Alon and Levy 1989:191), violin-shape fig- urines represent a level of abstraction in figurative representation not often seen in the Levantine archaeological record. The question of how to classify Chalcolithic figurative art and the delineation of artistic traditions is difficult. Defin- ing the objects at hand as figurative sculpture or representation, in particular human figures, creates a useful category for analysis. However, artistic traditions are often determined by the medium or material that is employed in their manu- facture. The majority of the fifty-nine violin-shape figurines found at Gilat during the 1975-77,1987, and 1990-92 seasons was fashioned from stones, including limestone, granite, sandstone, and other rock types. Only two samples "devi- ate" from this norm--one is made from terra cotta and the other from bone (Alon and Levy 1989:table 6). In addition, it would appear that similar techniques of drilling, grinding, and polishing were employed in the manufacture of all of these figurines. It must be recognized, however, that a reconstruction that emphasizes the physical properties in the selection of Biblical Archaeologist 59:3 (1996) 155</page><page sequence="7">materials represents but one possibility. We need to bear in mind that these figurines were indeed symbolic items and that a purely functional interpretation may not suffice. There has been speculation about the meaning of these objects, mostly centering on their possible cultic significance, e.g., associations with fertility (Amiran 1989; Alon and Levy 1989; Epstein 1978). Epstein (1978) has suggested that the pecu- liarly large nose on many of these figurines indicates the "breath of life," with cultic implications which cross-cut the many regional Chalcolithic cultural entities found through- out Palestine. The notion of a cultic affiliation for these figurines is supported by data which clearly places them in cultic con- texts; for example, a small cache discovered at Bir-es Safadi (Perrot 1959) and the plethora of violin-shape figurines found at the cult center at Gilat (Alon and Levy 1989; Levy and Alon 1993). In terms of the traditions of Chalcolithic representational art and symbolism, the Shiqmim figurine discussed here is unique in that it appears to combine elements of both the "violin-shape" figurine tradition and that of the Beersheva ivories. From the neck down, the new figurine is character- ized by the rectangular, palette-like shaped lower body and v-shape torso so typical of the violin-shape figurine tra- dition. Yet when viewed in profile, an expansion in the shape of the body can be observed. Whereas the violin-shapes appear straight, or flat, the upper body of the Shiqmim fig- urine moves forward and its lower body moves backward. Likewise, the Beersheva ivories generally have both a pro- jecting chest and pronounced buttocks. Thle Shiqmim example contains a sculpted anthropomorphic head. Its more natu- ralistic modeling of a nose and the representation of the eyes with inlay make it remarkably similar to the Beersheva ivories (Perrot 1959:pl. ii) and the Shiqmim anthropomorphic basalt head-a generic known as "Pinocchio figures." It is wor- thy of note that a headless violin-shape figurine from Shiqmim also displays breasts, yet no other detail on the lower body. Looking exclusively at facial structure, the Shiqmim bone figurine is perhaps most like the basalt head from Shiqmim (Levy and Alon 1987:511), with high orbits connected with a singularly large and also wide nose to produce a stylized effect. In terms of gender, the Beersheva ivories can usually be distinguished into male vs. female categories based not only on anatomical differences, but also the presence of holes drilled around the face which have been interpreted as recep- tacles for facial hair on male figures (Perrot 1959). Anatomical features and the absence of facial drilling make it possible to interpret the new anthropomorphic bone figurine from Shiqmim as female. The fluidity of elements from different traditions is also apparent in the fact that punctate marks decorate the lower body of the Shiqmim figurine in several places. Punc- tate marks occur on the head and face of two figurines from Bir-es Safadi (Perrot 1959:pl II, III) and one from Abu Matar (Perrot 1955:pl. 22) and in the groin area and under- arms of the headless figurine from Subterranean room 793-798 Violin-shape figurine from Gilat. This 20-cm high granite statuette is a singularly "abstract" artifact. The bone figurine from Shiqmim shares the shoulders and hips of the violin-shape: the rectangular lower body and v-shape torso. But, like the Beersheva ivories, the bone-carved Shiqmim figurine is not flat and possess a naturalistically rendered head. Thus the Shiqmim figurine fuses two stylistic traditions. Photo by A. Wolke courtesy of D. Alon. at Bir-es Safadi. However, while this form of decoration has never been found on violin-shape figurines, punctate design is an important motif in Chalcolithic art. The marks also appear on an ivory blade from Shiqmim (Levy and Holl 1987:717) and in the ivory "sickles" found in the Cave of the Treasure and at Shiqmim (Bar Adon 1980:16-20; Levy and Alon 1992:70). Beersheva Figurines as Mnemonic Devices Societies without written histories use a wide range of mnemonic devices to stimulate memory and the telling of their group's past. As Kuchler and Melion (1991:3) point out, memory is "a process precipitated and shaped by the relaying of visual information." Thus, images can stimu- late modes of recollection as well as influence how memory 156 Biblical Archaeologist 59:3 (1996)</page><page sequence="8">is constituted (Layton 1992:209). Cross-culturally, there are numerous traditional societies throughout the world which employ mnemonic devices. In the Islamic world, prayer beads (masbaha) are used to remember the ninety-nine names of G- d. Amongst the Inca, the quipu was employed as a recording device made of cord and string (Moseley 1992:13). However, contemporary ethnographic studies of mnemonic devices from Central Africa provide some of the best possible models for interpreting the prehistoric example presented here. In a recent study of memory, history, and art utilized in the central African kingdom of the Luba people, Roberts and Roberts (1996) analyze a wide range of Luba mnemonic devices-including memory boards, ancestor figures, royal staffs, and divination instruments from the eighteenth- twentieth century CE-to demonstrate the centrality of visual arts and related material culture to the formation, develop- ment, and remembrance of Luba kingship and political relations. The Roberts show how visual representation plays the key role in the making of Luba histories of kingship and center/periphery political intercourse. This cultural anthro- pology provides rich base-line data for the interpretation of art forms in non-Western societies that can illuminate some of the meaning embedded in prehistoric art such as the Shiqmim violin-shape figurine. It is suggested here that the Shiqmim figurine not only reflects the syncretistic melding of two cognitive systems from neighboring northern Negev communities, but was also used as a mnemonic device to aid in the perpetuation of local memory (largely beyond the grasp of the archaeol- ogist) about the local late fifth-fourth millennium societies in the Beersheva Valley. The social dimensions of West and Central African art provide important processual insights and models for interpreting the figurine discussed here and "primitive" art in general. One of the most significant Luba memory devices is the lukasa, a flat, hand-sized wooden object studded with beads and pins or covered with incised or bas-relief ideograms (Roberts and Roberts 1996:37). Each bead on the lukasa board stimulates an association of specific memories. During certain rituals, a lukasa is used to teach neophytes sacred lore about culture heroes, clan migrations, the foundations of sacred rule, the spatial loci of activities and offices within the kingdom or within a royal compound, and other social constructs. Thus, Luba mnemon- ics are not used to produce rigorous descent genealogies or king lists, but a "meaningful configuration of selected, nego-- tiated events around 'loci of memory'" (Roberts and Roberts 1996:38). Loci of memory or lieu de mrmoire (Jewsiewicki and Mudimbe 1993:101) provide a material basis around which past events structure present memory. With the lukasa, each bead and button stimulates memory of past images and places. Lukasas are all anthropomorphic or zoomorphic and represent the founding ancestress of the most important lin- eage association. They do not symbolize thought so much as stimulate it, and their multireferential iconography provides a multiplicity of meanings (Roberts and Roberts 1996:42).

A traditional Lukasa memory board for which, according to anthropologist Mary Nooter Roberts, a "reading" was made by Luba court officials in the former capital of Kalala Ilunga. Could the new Shiqmim figurine--as well as other elaborate punctate design artifacts-have served similarly as a mnemonic device among Chalcolithic communities? From Roberts and Roberts 1996:140-41. the same way, we suggest that the new Shiqmim figurine, with its enigmatic punctate design motif and anthropomor- phic female head, may have functioned as a mnemonic device related to the elite lineages in the Beersheva valley. Each incised dot or series of dots in objects such as the Shiqmim figurine or the Chalcolithic ivory "sickles" would have played a similar mnemonic role in prehistoric southern Levantine societies. Conclusion The newly discovered figurine from Shiqmim is special in several ways. Both in its use of bone as a medium and in its combination of elements from different yet related north- ern Negev Chalcolithic artistic traditions, this artifact is outstanding. The Shiqmim figurine transcends the bound- aries which have previously demarcated two distinct groups of Chalcolithic human figurines. Based on the new figurine, Biblical Archaeologist 59:3 (1996) 157</page><page sequence="9">the figurative art assemblages of late fifth-early fourth millennium Palestine can now be recognized as overlap- ping in cultural, stylistic, spatial, and chronological dimensions. Seen in this context, the Shiqmim figurine rep- resents a syncretistic melding of Chalcolithic ideological constructs- namely, the anthropomorphic "Pinocchio" motif so characteristic of the Beersheva Valley culture and the violin-shape figurine construct so com- mon in the Patish and lower Jordan valleys. More importantly, this combi- nation of styles reflects the exchange of deep-seated regional Chalcolithic rit- ual beliefs that were brought together at the Shiqmim settlement center in the Beersheva Valley. Finally, using recent ethnographic research, it is also pro- posed that figurines, and other objects with elaborate punctate design, functioned as mnemonic devices to aid in the transmission of memory among Chalcolithic communities. Together, these two explanatory frameworks rooted in anthro- pology help shed light on this impressive new piece of Chalcolithic representational art.

Notes 1 The figurine is categorized as Object number 47/93 - Locus 4147, Basket A374. 2 The pit (Locus 4147) has a diameter of 1.45 m, is 1.04 m deep, and has a volume of ca. 1.72 m' and is situated between squares 013/P13. Locus 4147 contained an ashy, silty fill which contained some mottled brown silts. The fill in the upper portion of the pit contained some fine lamina- tions and dip lines which may represent washed in sediment. Bibliography Alon, D. 1976 Two cult vessels from Gilat.
