Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1981. 296 pp. $20.00. Paul C. Violas University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Professor Sutton-Smith has written an interesting and important book for those concerned with the history of education, recreation, and social history and especially for scholars investigating the interaction of political economy, social institutions, and informal social expression. His overarching thesis is that the variety of children's play manifested from 1840 to 1950 in New Zealand largely reflected changing political economy and social ideology of the society. Thus, he segments the work into three eras: 1840-90, which reflects an agrarian society; the industrial world of 1890-1950; and, as an epilogue, 1950-80, reflecting our computer-technological society. Sutton-Smith notes that, during the earliest era, the New Zealand economy was primarily agrarian, while the social ideology was informed by the industrial culture of Great Britain. The result was two rather differing kinds of children's play. When children engaged in play activities without adult supervision or intrusion, which was usually the case, their play reflected the agrarian frontier existence of everyday life. It demonstrated self-reliance and egalitarianism. Play activities developed from children's creative imagination and most play things were crafted by the children. The author, however, masterfully shows how this agrarian reflex was complicated by the influx of an industrial ideology imported from the mother country. This industrial ideology yielded a somewhat contradictory set of play activities. During the times that children were under the supervision of adults, such as in school and at family gatherings, play activities reflected the industrial ideology and were generally designed to "keep the children in their place." While Sutton-Smith's preference is clearly for the free and creative play activities of this era, his admiration is not that of a mindless romantic. He vividly demonstrates how much of this play was vicious and dominated by the strongest of the youth. By the turn of the century, New Zealand's political economy was firmly tied to the industrial order of Western Europe, and this found PAUL C.

Creative self-expression was replaced by adult-managed and organized activities whose major objectives were to develop appropriate traits for worker-citizens. Group activities and team sports designed to develop cooperation, loyalty, and citizenship became staple fare for children. Commercialism in factory-produced toys and packaged viewer and listener activities became commonplace. Such developments, according to the author, represented a mixed blessing: "While there may be nostalgic regret at the loss of the variety of traditional games and some of the wide-ranged and even brutal autonomy of the nineteenth century, there is also recognition that there are, in the twentieth century, better opportunities in schooling, a kindlier community, and a more symbolic attitude toward life's mas- teries." Sutton-Smith's brief epilogic analysis of the recent past, 1950-80, presents his readers with an ambiguous pessimistic-optimistic outlook for child's play. He notes the continued control and adult-imposed organization of child's play and the intrusion of organized, commercial recreation and leisure in the previous sanctuary, the home, via tele- communications, packaged games, and sophisticated toys. While the author recognizes the potential dangers in these developments, he prefers to remain hopeful that they can be turned to a humane and creative development of childhood based on the opportunities potentially present in our modern and increasingly informative culture. One can only hope this is correct. Unfortunately, there is little in our recent past to sustain such optimism. A History of Children's Play demonstrates the value of oral history when conducted by an informed and sensitive historian. Sutton-Smith utilized hundreds of interviews with informants from every province and school district in New Zealand. This evidence was supplemented with teachers' log books, school reports, and jubilee magazines to produce an impressive history. The most discernible weakness of the work involves the stylistic utilization of quotations. Often the author provides a series of quotes with little interpretative interruption or introduction. At times it almost seems that he expects the quotes to be self-explanatory. Perhaps one additional rewrite, or more careful editing, would have smoothed over these stylistic bumps in an otherwise very readable and thoroughly enjoyable book. Nevertheless, Sutton-Smith presents a work that is an important contribution to the scholarship in social history. It is generally well written, carefully researched, and fully documented. The thesis, while not entirely novel, complements the recent work of critical social and educational historians in the United States and Great Britain and, 376 American Journal of Education</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews when put in this stream, adds an important element for the development of a comparative social history. A History of Children's Play is a book that deserves attention. The Classroom Society: The Construction of Educational Experience by Herbert A. Thelen. New York: Halsted Press, 1981. 226 pp. $27.95. Arthur Blumberg Syracuse University Let me start out very directly. At first glance, the casual reader of The Classroom Society may be inclined to toss it off as a warmed-over plea to mobilize education under the banner of a new "progressive" education, seeking to resuscitate "life adjustment" as what schools should be all about. To do so would be a rather gross error. Furthermore, the book cannot be read casually. It needs to be studied, thought about, and, if an anthropomorphism is permitted, argued with. Put another way, the book may be seen as an invitation to the reader to engage in an internal dialogue about the values, assumptions, and practices that historically have provided the basis of educational enterprise. The dialogue, though, is not only an intellectual one. Inescapably, for the serious reader, it will also involve the emotions, as Thelen forces us to compare what we do in the name of education with what we might do. He rattles the skeletons in one of our back closets, and, for most of us -university professors or public school teachers-this can be a somewhat disconcerting experience. Can Thelen really be writing about me? If I am honest, the answer is yes. But like anyone who is reading this review, I have learned well how to rationalize my behavior as I see it conflicting with some of my values. Nonetheless, the book should not be read if one is unwilling to engage in such a dialogue. So much for my own preface to The Classroom Society. The Classroom Society is more than a book about classrooms and teachers. It is, perhaps, equally a book about Herbert Thelen. It speaks not only of the delicate and complex issues of educating children, making policies about their education, about curriculum and evaluation, ARTHUR BLUMBERG is professor of education in the School of Ed- ucation, Syracuse University.
