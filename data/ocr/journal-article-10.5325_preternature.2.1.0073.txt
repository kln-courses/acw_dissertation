         <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
         <p>The practice of <italic>Ushi no Koku Mairi</italic>, or worshiping at the hour of the ox or cow, is a Japanese form of both execration and execration prevention, loosely associated with premodern rituals of <italic>Onmyôdô</italic>, which is a form of esoteric cosmology incorporating Shinto, Buddhism, and Taoism. Once considered a mere ritual found in classical Japanese literature, Ushi no Koku Mairi is now a syncretic product of folklore, quasi-religious practice, and popular culture. Although Ushi no Koku Mairi is most popularly practiced as cyber-execration where clients may pay to cast curses over the Internet,<sup>1</sup> several websites also market a “cursing kit” containing material items used in cursing rituals.</p>
         <p>While gathering data for this article, operators of execration websites were particularly private and unresponsive to my requests for interviews. Thus, out of respect for the privacy of these subjects, I studied these websites by emphasizing the perspective of a potential client. In an attempt to illustrate this phenomenon in a more manageable fashion, I randomly selected five websites that I then combined to form a general composite that brings together their most apparent commonalities.<sup>2</sup> In this composite, with little variation between merchants, the contents of these cursing kits include a do-it-yourself manual, a straw doll, a set of prayer beads, a stretch of rope, a wooden stick, a hammer, nails, candles and a piece of Japanese cedar. In general, these kits may be purchased from ¥3,500 to ¥10,000—on the average, some ¥7,630, or US$98.94.</p>
         <p>The use of the cursing kit requires faith. Although the cursing advertisements guarantee effective results, in reality the effectiveness of the kits rests on one's ability to control the definition of the situation. In the terms of W. I. Thomas's famous dictum “If men [or women] define situations as real, they are real in their consequences”—a particularly germane statement to the dynamics of the cursing endeavor.<sup>3</sup> That is, purchasing a cursing kit and executing a curse only initiates the defining process; however, it is the search for indications that suggest positive results that organizes one's impression of a successful curse. For example, casting a curse on someone and then learning that he or she has experienced some subsequent misfortune serves to confirm belief in the effectiveness of the curse. In this way, the effectiveness of these kits depends on learning of such indications.</p>

         <p>The websites themselves do not offer any actual curses, but instead many of them provide customer testimonies that describe the effectiveness of these cursing kits. In general, these testimonies can be divided into those curses that were cast with relatively harmless intentions and geared toward achieving some sort of success, and those that were cast with much more harmful intentions, often associated with antipathy and vengeance. Those testimonies that described the effectiveness of curses cast with such harmless intentions ranged from those that sought assistance in finding love and marriage, to those that sought lottery winnings. In one instance of these testimonies, an individual actually cursed his own cancer from within himself. In this case the client's physician had actually given him a terminal prognosis. With the advice of a friend, the client purchased a cursing kit in desperation, cursed the cancer, and subsequently prolonged his life. According to the client, although he didn't initially believe in the power of such magic, once he received the cursing kit he felt a powerful force from within it.<sup>4</sup> In this testimony, he explains that cursing is not merely an enterprise for causing harm, but may also be used to achieve success.</p>
         <p>Conversely, those testimonies that described the effectiveness of curses cast with more harmful intentions, and often associated with antipathy and vengeance, included those that successfully caused individuals to lose their jobs, ruined relationships, and even inflicted physical harm on others. In a rather serious example, when a client learned that she had been betrayed by her new boyfriend who was preparing to marry another woman, she ordered a cursing kit and began casting curses to cause the couple misfortune. Within two months of cursing, her partner's fiancée was in a serious car accident and the wedding plans were apparently canceled. To the client's satisfaction, the once-engaged boyfriend was now living happily with client—all of which she attributed to the effectiveness of the cursing kit.<sup>5</sup>
         </p>
         <p>As these testimonies demonstrate, definitions of cursing and how it may operate vary significantly. Although cursing may be regarded as an exercise of verbally invoking misfortune on a given person, place, or thing in the form of derogatory speech, cursing also has a social function whereby the avowed is allied with actual rituals of converting words into practice.<sup>6</sup> Studies of this latter form of cursing as a social phenomenon may be viewed through what Mary Douglas referred to as “spiritual powers,” where human action mediates the mundane through perceived supernatural force. According to Douglas these powers may be classified as (1) internal, or that which arises uncontrolled and sui generis from within an individual; and (2) those external powers that are controllable and must be consciously tended to by a practitioner in order to execute his or her intentions.<sup>7</sup> In this article, I focus on material items that assist the practitioner in exercising these external forms of spiritual power.</p>
         <p>Cursing has appeared as a peripheral focus within literature on witchcraft;<sup>8</sup> has been emphasized as a product of magic;<sup>9</sup> and has been explored within studies of syncretic religions of the Americas—specifically with regard to the misinterpreted practices of Voodoo.<sup>10</sup> Scholars of the Abrahamic religions have noted a substantial presence of both cursing and blessing in their traditions as well.<sup>11</sup>
         </p>
         <p>In Japan, the practice of cursing is located within a larger classification of folk magic.<sup>12</sup> The terms <italic>majinai</italic> and <italic>noroi</italic> 
            <sup>13</sup> denote at least two forms of this folk magic; the former refers to a host of magical practices such as safeguarding oneself from misfortune through the use of amulets and talismans, while the latter refers to cursing for the purpose of invoking harm on another individual or community.<sup>14</sup> Ushi no Koku Mairi is most often associated with noroi; thus the items outlined in this article are intended to cause misfortune as opposed to guarding against it.</p>
         <p>The parameters of Ushi no Koku Mairi are bound to Onmyôdô's system of cosmologies originating in China and brought to Japan during the sixth century. Within this system, certain animals and items in nature correspond with various qualities of time, date, and direction, designating their level of malevolence or benevolence. In this system, Ushi no Koku Mairi is believed to designate a period between 1:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m., corresponding to the animal signs of the ox or cow (<italic>ushi</italic>) and the tiger (<italic>tora</italic>). As the layout of a twelve-hour clock simulates the cosmic order of the Onmyôdô, the upper-right-hand quadrant between the hours of 1:00 and 3:00 is also representative of the northeast direction. In combination, these times, symbols, and directions are said to represent a dimension where malevolent spirits roam free.</p>
         <p>Each item in the cursing kit serves a specific function in the execration ritual, which may last up to seven days. At the center of these execration rituals is a straw doll known as the <italic>waraningō</italic>, used as an effigy representing the individual to be cursed. In addition, the cursing kits also include a stretch of rope used to fasten the waraningō in place during the cursing ritual; candles to enhance the transference of the curse to the waraningō; a set of prayer beads or a guardian stone to protect the practitioner; a hammer, set of nails, and a wooden stick known as a <italic>takegushi</italic> used to impale the waraningō; and a piece of Japanese cedar for practitioners to substitute in place of a tree in event that their surroundings do not permit access to a shrine or forest.</p>
         <p>Interpreting the overall purpose of such objects associated with transcendence can be illuminated by fuller theoretical analysis. David Morgan's work on religious visual culture is particularly useful here. Morgan notes that “seeing is not an isolated or ‘pure’ biological or cultural activity,” but instead “is part of the entire human sensorium, interwoven with all manner of behaviors and cultural routines.”<sup>15</sup> The diversity of this activity, especially in relation to viewing an object, suggests that items subject to interpretation are capable of yielding much more complex meanings.</p>
         <p>In an effort to reveal what objects do (in particular, those of the visually religious sort),<sup>16</sup> Morgan outlines a typology of functions that such material culture represents. These types of functions include (1) an ordering of time and space, (2) imagining a larger community, (3) communicating with the transcendent, (4) an embodying form of communion with the transcendent, (5) collaboration with other forms of representation, (6) an influencing of thought and behavior by persuasion or magic, and (7) a displacing of rival images and ideologies.<sup>17</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Each of Morgan's seven types of functions can be found through interaction with the cursing kit. While the precepts associated with the rituals of Ushi no Koku Mairi reorganize both time and space, the venture of cursing is grounded in an imagination of a larger community. The use of the cursing kit also embodies a form of communication and communion with the transcendent, as the objects it contains serve oracular functions, where interaction with them is an undertaking in solving problems that requires the petitioning of the supernatural. A variety of practices associated with the cursing ritual are all, in combination, a form of collaborating with other forms of representation—especially those forms that have originated through one's subjective encounters with cursing in popular culture. Additionally, the cursing kit and the cursing project influence thought and behavior by persuasion and magic, as they involve the structuring of everyday activities such as prayer, pilgrimage, and the use of objects grounded in superstition. Finally, the defacement of effigies representative of the individual being cursed is a form of displacing rival images and ideologies.</p>

         <title>FROM PREMODERN PRACTICE TO CONTEMPORARY POPULAR CULTURE</title>
         <p>Although the exact origin of Ushi no Koku Mairi is unknown, classical Japanese literature would suggest that it may be traced back to an eclectic mixture of rituals associated with Onmyôdô established in Japan during the early to middle Heian period. With their elite knowledge of cosmology, the <italic>Onmyôji</italic>, or practitioners of Onmyôdô, were thought of as mediators between worldly-man and other-worldly-spirits, holding rather important roles as advisers to the Imperial court.</p>
         <p>One of the most well-known Onmyôjis was Abe no Seimei (921–1005), who served the Heian Imperial court as an adviser, astrologer, and mystic, popularly recognized for his abilities associated with divination.<sup>18</sup> Abe no Seimei plays a particularly important role in the development of Ushi no Koku Mairi, as his protective execration is said to have neutralized one of the most infamous curses in Japanese folklore. The incident surrounding this curse is described in one section of the <italic>Heike Monogatari</italic>, an epic tale of war and control of Japan during the Heian period. As the story is commonly told, a female seeking revenge for her husband's adulterous indiscretions traveled to the <italic>Kibune</italic> 
            <sup>19</sup> shrine in Kyoto with the intention of casting a curse on her former spouse. After pleading her case to a god, the woman is given instructions on how to execute revenge.</p>
         <p>A more specific depiction of this incident is found in one popular <italic>Nōh</italic> play,<sup>20</sup> titled <italic>Kanawa</italic> (or “Iron Crown”):
<disp-quote>
               <p>In the reign of Emperor Saga (809–823) a certain noblewoman was possessed by jealousy. For seven days she shut herself up at the Kibune Shrine and prayed to the god that he change her into a demon so that she might kill the woman who had occasioned her jealousy. The god … instructed her to bathe for thirty-seven days in the rapids of the Uji River. Secluding herself in a deserted spot, she divided her long hair into five bunches and fashioned these bunches into horns. She daubed her face with vermilion and her body with cinnabar, set on her head an iron tripod with burning brands attached to its legs and held in her mouth another brand, burning at both ends.<sup>21</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Though some versions of the Nōh, such as this one, end in the successful murder of her former husband and his mistress, the more common version depicts her former husband seeking the assistance of Abe no Seimei and triumphantly defending himself and his family from the curse. In this version, Abe no Seimei constructs an altar adorned with life-size dolls designed to encumber the wife's original curse. Upon her arrival, the vengeful woman directs her malice toward the dolls, diverting the potency of the curse while Abe no Seimei then exorcises the demon from her.<sup>22</sup>
         </p>
         <p>In this way, this story within the <italic>Heike Monogatari</italic> establishes some distinctive features about cursing in the premodern era. The actions of both the vengeful female and her spouse provided a rudimentary understanding of how cursing can be executed—a historical account straddling fact and fiction that serves as a foundation for references to cursing in the future.</p>
         <p>Up through the twentieth century, Ushi no Koku Mairi received very little attention, aside from the Nōh play <italic>Kanawa</italic> and various depictions in Japanese art. For example, Tsukioka Kōgyo's 1922 woodblock painting titled <italic>The Iron Crown</italic> features the vengeful wife preparing her curse in front of an altar, head adorned with the iron trivet, and face disguised behind a porcelain mask of the <italic>namanari</italic>, or a woman–demon hybrid.</p>
         <p>The arrival of foreigners renewed some interest in the cursing practice—arguably, as a larger project to exotify the traditions and customs of a Japanese society previously closed off to the rest of the world. Lord Redesdale, a British diplomat who developed an interest in Japanese art and literature, wrote perhaps the most detailed account of the practice. Redesdale's <italic>Ushi no Toki Mairi</italic> 
            <sup>23</sup> incorporates that air of early twentieth-century orientalism through the comparative method:

               <p>The trees around a Shintô shrine are specially under the protection of the god to whom the altar is dedicated; and, in connection with them, there is a kind of magic still respected by the superstitious, which recalls the waxen dolls, through the medium of which sorcerers of the middle ages in Europe, and indeed those of ancient Greece, as Theocritus tells us, pretended to kill the enemies of their clients. This is called Ushi no toki mairi, or “going to worship at the hour of the ox,” and is practised by jealous women who wish to be revenged upon their faithless lovers.</p>
               <p>When the world is at rest, at two in the morning, the hour of which the ox is the symbol, the woman rises; she dons a white robe and high sandals or clogs; her coif is a metal tripod, in which are thrust three lighted candles; around her neck she hangs a mirror, which falls upon her bosom; in her left hand she carries a small straw figure, the effigy of the lover who has abandoned her, and in her right she grasps a hammer and nails, with which she fastens the figure to one of the sacred trees that surround the shrine. There she prays for the death of the traitor, vowing that, if her petition be heard, she will herself pull out the nails which now offend the god by wounding the mystic tree. Night after night she comes to the shrine, and each night she strikes in two or more nails, believing that every nail will shorten her lover's life, for the god, to save his tree, will surely strike him dead.<sup>24</sup>

         <p>Lafcadio Hearn, an Irishman commissioned as a newspaper correspondent, drew from several folkloric stories and compiled them as thin accounts of Japanese culture—always certain to draw out their oddities. Here, Hearn makes mention of the cursing ritual in relation to European literature:
<disp-quote>
               <p>If you should make a little man of straw, for the same reason that Sister Helen made a little man of wax,—and nail it, with nails not less than five inches long, to some tree in a temple-grove at the Hour of the Ox,—and if the person, imaginatively represented by that little straw man, should die thereafter in atrocious agony.<sup>25</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>These accounts from Redesdale and Hearn contribute to the modern imagery of Ushi no Koku Mairi, especially in terms of providing rudimentary background for casting curses in Japan.</p>
         <p>In the last few decades, there has been a contemporary resurgence of interest in Ushi no Koku Mairi within Japanese popular culture. In particular, popular television programs such as <italic>Omoikkiri Telebi</italic>,<sup>26</sup> 
            <italic>Ookami Shonen</italic>,<sup>27</sup> 
            <italic>News no Mori</italic>,<sup>28</sup> and <italic>Honoujani</italic> 
            <sup>29</sup> have all run stories about the reappearance of cursing in Japanese society. Printed Japanese literature has also documented this public interest, including features in the magazines <italic>World's Subculture</italic> 
            <sup>30</sup> and <italic>Hardest Magazine</italic>,<sup>31</sup> as well as several books documenting the art and practice of cursing.<sup>32</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Popular film and manga have also all capitalized on this resurgence—at times appropriating the classical versions of cursing, and at other times improvising in such a way that Ushi no Koku Mairi takes on a much more graphic representation.<sup>33</sup> For example, in one scene from the 2001 film <italic>Onmyôji</italic>, Abe no Seimei is recruited to fend off a namanari that seeks vengeance against the Emperor and his heir infant son, Prince Atsuhira.<sup>34</sup> Similar to the Nōh play of <italic>Kanawa</italic>, the namanari executes a ritual where multiple pairs of waraningō effigies are overlaid with rectangular sheets of paper and inscribed with curses. With the candles of her iron crown aflame, the namanari is depicted in a wash of waraningōs nailed to trees throughout the surrounding forest.</p>
         <p>Several manga comics also contain references to Ushi no Koku Mairi. In Takeshi Okano's manga series <italic>Jigoku Sensei Nūbē</italic> (or “Hell Teacher Nūbē”), one alluring 1994 episode features a white-clad woman practicing Ushi no Koku Mairi, apparently possessed by the thrill of finding pleasure in harming others.<sup>35</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Additionally, Hiro Mashima's popular weekly manga series <italic>Fairy Tail</italic> is filled with references to cursing. One character with particularly frequent association is the wizard Kain Hikaru. Indeed, Kain's magical ability—though far removed from the imagery found in the Nōh play of <italic>Kanawa</italic>—is referred to as “Ushi no Koku Mairi,” practiced largely in tandem with his magic doll named Mr. Cursey. Kain has the ability to harm others by appropriating strands of hair from his victims, attaching them to Mr. Cursey, and manipulating the doll to bring misfortune to the individual he deems it to represent.</p>
         <p>This interest in Ushi no Koku Mairi has also been accommodated by consumer culture on the Internet. Websites marketing everything from surrogate cursing through cyber-execration to do-it-yourself kits have proliferated. Although the instruction for cursing varies and its display and practice have deviated drastically—at times improvising—from the hodgepodge of its origins in premodern Japan, Ushi no Koku Mairi is now a rather intriguing component of Japanese popular culture.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s03">
         <title>MATERIAL CULTURE OF THE CURSING KIT</title>
         <p>With little variation, these kits generally include a do-it-yourself manual, a waraningō, candles, a set of prayer beads or a guardian stone, a stretch of rope, a hammer, a set of nails, a wooden stick, and a piece of Japanese cedar. According to several do-it-yourself manuals, the cursing ritual begins with preparation. The practitioner must first commit to a weeklong procedure, repeating the ritual contiguously for seven days. The practitioner must also commit to certain details that ensure the curse will be effective—namely, that secrecy must be observed at all times. In the event that the practitioner is seen publicly, the curse will immediately be nullified and the practitioner must then start the ritual all over again from the beginning.</p>
         <p>After reading through several manuals, it becomes quite clear that the waraningō is the most important item in the cursing kit. These waraningōs are crafted out of trimmed straw shafts and bound with short strips of rope. Their dimensions are roughly six to seven inches in height and four to five inches in length. The diameter of their torsos and heads are about two inches around, while arms and legs range from half an inch to two inches, respectively.</p>
         <p>Being made of straw, the waraningō arrives with no personal identifiers attached to it. According to the manual, the practitioner should first procure personal items from the intended victim, such as a lock of hair or an article of their clothing. These items must then be attached to or interwoven in the straw of the waraningō. Some manuals note that if a photograph of the intended victim is obtained, placing it over the chest area of the waraningō will make the curse particularly effective.</p>
         <p>The incorporation of these personal items from the intended victim is meant to solidify the connection between the effigy and the individual. The belief in transferring oneself to an object or even endowing an object with particular qualities of another individual is quite common in Japan. Defacing pictures that represent others, for example, is one of these practices. In one instance, a rather famous picture of the <italic>Hashiri Daikoku</italic>, or a fleeing man with his sack of possessions, is used as a medium to stop a pursued thief:
<disp-quote>
               <p>In order to injure, by laming, so that he may be captured, a thief who has decamped, this picture is set up, inverted, on a wall, and pins or needles are driven through each foot, and, by some people, through whatever other parts the operator wishes to injure (excepting the throat, “lest the victim die”), while a promise is made that if the victim is caught the pins will be removed and the picture set in its proper position.<sup>36</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>This transference may also be seen in more anthropomorphic effigies. In fact, the origins of <italic>Hinamasturi</italic>, or the traditional Japanese Doll Festival, featured a practice of transmitting a girl's impurities to a paper doll, then casting them down river in order exorcise herself of these impurities:
<disp-quote>
               <p>A doll received from an <italic>on'yoji</italic> one would stroke his (or her) body and thus, it is believed, the bodily uncleanness or evil attachment might pass onto the doll; then one would return the “defilement loading” doll to the <italic>on'yoji</italic>, who, after performing an exorcism, let it flow into the river.<sup>37</sup>

         <p>Within the ritual of Ushi no Koku Mairi, the mimetic transference of an individual's personal qualities to the waraningō is relatively simple. According to the instructions, practitioners are supposed to use their hatred to gaze into the doll's inner soul and petition an evil spirit to enter.</p>
         <p>The next steps deal with the preparation of the practitioner. To begin, the practitioners must gown themselves in white clothing and powder or paint their faces with white makeup. Several, though not all, manuals also instruct the practitioners to apply red lipstick. Judging by the imagery found in traditional Ushi no Koku Mairi depictions where the practitioner's head is adorned with a crown of burning candles, one might assume that fastening a headdress aflame would be the next step in the ritual, yet the cursing kits direct the practitioner to use the lit candles placed nearby to enhance the transference of the curse into the waraningō. As these kits are associated with licensed businesses, the change in this practice from wearing a burning crown to the use of their illumination in a ritual of transference may suggest that the risk of doing harm to a practitioner (i.e., catching one's hair on fire) presents issues of liability. Accordingly, these manuals do not explicitly instruct practitioners to fashion burning candles on their heads.</p>
         <p>After one's personal appearance is prepared, the practitioner is ready to make the journey to the shrine or forest, or to utilize the piece of Japanese cedar as a substitute. The time the practitioner begins the ritual, and the position from which he or she executes the curse are important considerations. The practitioner must execute the curse between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m., as well as position him- or herself facing northeast—corresponding to the cosmological direction of the ox as established in Onmyôdô.</p>
         <p>Once the practitioner has observed the instructions of time and position, the waraningō is then hoisted to a tree or fastened to the Japanese cedar with the stretch of rope to hold it in place for the ritual of impaling. In addition to holding the waraningō in place during the ritual, the stretch of rope has at least two other functions. The first occurs during the ritual, where the rope creates a physical barrier between the practitioner and the waraningō, as well as holding the curse together. As the waraningō is said to be both representative of the intended victim and possessed by the evil spirit after transference, the rope then binds the two entities together and solidifies this connection.</p>
         <p>The second function of the rope is intended to preserve the waraningō during the interim between each of the seven days of cursing. In this way, the rope is used to suspend the waraningō in an inconspicuous location—wrapped around the neck while in suspension in order to inflict the maximum amount of harm.</p>
         <p>The next step is the impaling ritual. Much of this step is left to the discretion of the practitioner, who may use the hammer and nails to pound the waraningō to the wooden surface or instead opt to torture the effigy with the wooden stick known as a <italic>takegushi.</italic> The takegushi is a rather thin, toothpick-shaped stick of about a foot in length. Depending on the location through which the takegushi is driven, the practitioner may inflict particular forms of physical and mental harm.</p>
         <p>Regardless of the method the practitioner chooses to use, he or she is also advised to accompany each blow or insertion with an audible avowing of a curse. As there is no set mantra stated in the instructions, practitioners are again left to their own devices and thus have the opportunity to personalize their curses.</p>
         <p>Finally, with some variation, cursing kits include a guardian stone or set of prayer beads known as <italic>nenju</italic>. These items are intended to protect the practitioner during the cursing ritual. As the notion of curse-casting may bring harm to the practitioner—a concept known as <italic>noroi gaeshi</italic>, or returning curse—both the guardian stones and the nenjus function as protective amulets.</p>
         <p>David Morgan's typology of functions is particularly useful in interpreting the practice of Ushi no Koku Mairi in theoretical terms. To begin with, Ushi no Koku Mairi and the cursing kit serve to organize time and space. According to Morgan:
<disp-quote>
               <p>Images and objects can operate very powerfully … by organizing the spaces of worship and devotion, delineating certain places as sacred, such as pilgrimages sites, temples, domestic spaces, and public religious festivals.<sup>38</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Executing a curse at the “hour of the ox” is an obvious organization of time. By adhering to the traditions established by the Onmyôdô rituals, one orders time in relation to a set of premodern cosmological interpretations. To cast a curse at any other time of day or night would be to dabble in an entirely different endeavor, independent of Ushi no Koku Mairi.</p>
         <p>Space is also ordered around the dictates of Ushi no Koku Mairi and the cursing kit. In particular, the Kibune shrine and its surrounding forests in Kyoto have become frequent places of pilgrimage for curse-casting activity.<sup>39</sup> In addition, other sites associated with the classical narratives surrounding Ushi no Koku Mairi have garnered considerable attention as locales that increase the effectiveness of curses, including <italic>Seimei-jinja</italic>, a shrine in Kyoto dedicated to the sorcerer Abe no Seimei, and the <italic>Hashihime</italic> shrine, a bridge and shrine dedicated to the spiteful princess mentioned in the <italic>Genji Monogatari</italic> and a possible source of the character found in the <italic>Kanawa</italic> Nōh play.</p>
         <p>As the directions of the cursing kit do not require that a practitioner is present at a particular shrine or forest, using the cedar wood included in the kit allows practitioners to cast the curse in a much more symbolic fashion. Nonetheless, the portion of wood as a symbolic feature still organizes space within the locus of the cursing activity.</p>
         <p>Morgan, building on a common theme found in political science,<sup>40</sup> identifies the function of images and objects in imagining communities. According to Morgan:
<disp-quote>
               <p>Community must be envisioned in the things believers do in order for them to be realized in a concrete, corporeal way that they belong to this world or clan or tradition and that doing so ensures them of the benefits of membership, such an enduring identity and sense of purpose.<sup>41</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Objects of nationalism or enduring religious symbols that bind communities to one common identity would be obvious examples of Morgan's typology. Although the cursing kit would appear to be aligned with an attempt to divide a community through vengeance, an alternative interpretation may shed light on personal intentions of actually becoming closer to a community through removing the discomfort engendered by a particular individual. That is, ridding a community of a figure that has caused discomfort cannot solely be thought of as a divisive project, but should also be considered a way of becoming closer to a community by eliminating an obstacle (person, place or thing) that stands in the way of a personal tie to the community at large. Additionally, the practice of Ushi no Koku Mairi, especially in its representation within popular culture, serves as one form of fostering a connection to Japanese folklore found largely within the mythological roots of Japan. Indeed communal superstitions, legends, symbols, and the like are all, in combination, the fabric of imagined communities that establish linkages between the past and present.</p>
         <p>Morgan's next two functions of communication with the transcendent and embodying forms of communion with the transcendent may be combined here. The functions herein are to establish a medium through which the supernatural being is “available for petition, praise, offering and negotiation.”<sup>42</sup> By extension, these items, now mediums, serve an oracular function, where interaction with them or in the presence of them is a venture in solving problems. Though the entire cursing ritual is a rather chaotic form of problem solving, especially due to its unpredictability and lack of substantial outcomes assessment, the means through which it is executed certainly seeks to channel the transcendent in an effort to solve a problem. In addition, the actual use of the waraningōs as effigies of intended victims is a petition for the transcendent to mediate worldly matters and respond to the request of the practitioner.</p>
         <p>Further, items that embody communion with the transcendent may also be found in practices of portraying oneself in the same fashion found in the classical depictions of Ushi no Koku Mairi. Indeed, illustrating his point with ceremonies incorporating the use of masks in African cultures, Morgan notes that these objects “manifest the supernatural by replacing the identity of the ritual participant with the person of a departed ancestor or spirit.”<sup>43</sup> By following the directions of the cursing kit manual and presenting oneself in the fashion depicted in the <italic>Kanawa</italic> Nōh, one is actually replicating the imagery of the vengeful woman, namanari, demon, et cetera. In this way, the practitioner of the curse could be said to be communing with the transcendent.</p>
         <p>Collaborating with other forms of representation, Morgan's fifth type of function may be illustrated through the cursing ritual itself. The mere purchase or possession of the cursing kit alone does nothing to invoke misfortune. Instead, the various preparations, attention paid to detail of cursing, gathering of personal items, concentration of transferring the curse, impaling the waraningō, or even avowing audibly during the curse, make for an experience of divergent, though interwoven, activities that, in combination, establish the effectiveness of the curse.</p>
         <p>Objects may also serve as instruments of influence. This function, above all others, is particularly germane to the cursing kit, as it outlines the perceived operational capacities of the cursing objects themselves. From prayer and pilgrimage to the use of such folkloric practices as possessing lucky amulets and abiding by superstitions, all are meant to influence the mundane. The practice of Ushi no Koku Mairi functions as a form of conflict resolution, perhaps irrational, but nonetheless rife with intentions of influencing everyday life.</p>
         <p>Finally, in Morgan's last type of function, he discusses the displacement of rival images and ideologies. The obvious purpose of this would be to establish the superiority of the offender's community or beliefs in contrast to those of another. What practitioners of Ushi no Koku Mairi may lack in images and ideologies, they make up for in personal vengeance toward their intended victims. Though much more individual in approach than representative of a larger community, practitioners of cursing deface, implore, and impale the waraningō effigies—a direct and violent displacement of a rival.</p>

         <title>CONCLUSION</title>
         <p>The practice of Ushi no Koku Mairi has obscure origins, as well as a rather disjointed historical development. As it is understood today, Ushi no Koku Mairi is an eclectic mix of premodern Japanese folklore dating back to early in the eighth century and quasi-religious rituals associated with the esoteric cosmological circles of Onmyôdô. More recently, Ushi no Koku Mairi and the general cursing milieu have undergone a pop cultural revival, incorporating Japanese classical drama and literature.</p>
         <p>The cursing kit offers the tools of a mimetic endeavor, whereby one's actions in the preparation and execution of the curse are endowed with transcendental beliefs and qualities that mirror practitioner's intentions. The items themselves are rather simple in appearance and structure, yet when put into practice, they are said to embody supernatural qualities.</p>
         <p>David Morgan's typology of functions is particularly useful in interpreting the functions of the cursing kit. Yet even with this typology, there are admittedly some limitations with regard to the psychological underpinnings that generate the intentions to invoke misfortune on another, as well as a tendency to reduce each item to its structural–functionalist capacities. Notwithstanding these challenges, the interpretation above provides a point of departure for future research into the practice of Ushi no Koku Mairi in Japan.</p>
