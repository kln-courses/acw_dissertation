This object has been described in an exhibit catalogue (Ingeborg Maurer "Das Lächeln Mexikos: Tonfiguren aus dem zentralen Veracruz", Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museum, Köln, Cat. No. 58, p. 57,1980), but not illustrated. In 1994 this head was on exhibit at an art gallery in Graz, where it could be photographed and can now be presented here. The specimen is from a private German collection and measures 21.5 cm in height and 23.5 cm in width. It allegedly comes from the Gulf Coast région of the Mexican State of Veracruz and is of Late Classic date. The clay is a sand and orange coloured material and there remain traces of black pigment. The head is hollow and broken off from a larger object, whether from a large, anthropomorphic figure or from a vessel or incensario cannot be said. The mouth is wide open, but no teeth are visible, and the eyes are unusually depicted, with accentuated eyelids. The head is decorated with large, round earplugs and an extraordinary headdress, consisting of a double headband and a wide and horizontally placed textile bow. This particular headdress, the open mouth, and the rendering of the eyes, have led to the suggestion that the Central Mexican deity Xipe Totee may be portrayed. How ever, the iconographical elements are insufficient for deter mining whether a human or divine being is represented.
