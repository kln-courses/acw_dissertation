<plain_text><page sequence="1">Far Eastern Sculpture (City Art Museum, St Louis) THE City Art Museum of St Louis, Missouri has recently acquired three important examples of Far Eastern Sculpture. The earliest is a wooden Shint5 Goddess (Fig.5I), carved in Japan in the ninth century, that is to say during the Heian period (794-1185). Shint6 was a very loosely organized religion which had been able to accept the incursion of both Confucianism and Buddhism without upset and had adopted some of the ideas, images, and ritual of these religions into its worship. One of the major adop- tions was that of anthropomorphic sculpture. Most Shint6 sculpture was of wood and portrayed an anonymous personage dressed in the court fashion of the period. Naturally, these figures also contained elements of Buddhist iconography: Buddhist art was the major art of the period, and there was no conflict between the two religions themselves or between their adherents. The standing bronze Pirvati (Fig.49) was made in Southern India during the Chola period (850-11 I50). Parvati was the con- sort of the lord ?iva, the third member of the Hindu trinity and the embodiment of the universal power of destruction and renewal. As helpmate and as the lakti or energy of ?iva, Pdrvati was an integral aspect of his power. She is the essence of the female principle: a symbol of the fecundity of man, the world, and the universe; a part indivisible from the regenerative aspect of Siva, and an intrinsic manifestation of the Great Mother and of the Godhead itself. This divine expression of the feminine is well expressed in the rhythm of the figure, with its repetition of swelling curves. The statue was acquired with the aid of The Charles E. Merrill Trust. The third piece of sculpture is a wooden Buddha (Fig.5o) of the Kamakura period (I 185-1392). This has long been attributed to the Japanese master, Kaikei, who was active during the late twelfth century, but since it is neither signed nor documented, the attribution to the sculptor himself is usually treated with caution, especially as he had many followers. The particular character of the St Louis figure, with its benign expression and serenity of pose, is typical of the work produced by Kaikei.</page><page sequence="2">50.
