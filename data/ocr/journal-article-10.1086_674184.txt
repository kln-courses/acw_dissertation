      <p>This is what I remember about an event that happened twenty years ago. I travelled to Los Angeles to make studio visits as research for ‘Sonsbeek 93’, an exhibition that I was organising for the following year, to take place in Arnhem, in the Netherlands.<sup>1</sup> I knew I would see Mike Kelley, because we had known each other since he presented his projects <italic>Monkey Island</italic> and <italic>Confusion</italic> at Metro Pictures in New York in 1982,<sup>2</sup> when I became smitten with his work and with his winning personality. I had never seen anything quite like these installations. There was stuff all over the walls, the floor and even hanging from the ceiling. I was particularly impressed with an ink drawing of a screaming mandrake root, its anthropomorphism and the sheer emotional impact of the image. And so started my little flirtation with him and his work.</p>
      <p>By 1992 Mike was at his peak, and everyone wanted a piece of him and his work. So I drove to his house up the hill on North Figueroa Street knowing that I was coming at a time when he was feeling a bit burned out on biennials and big group exhibitions. Mike’s phone voice could be matter-of-fact and his lack of enthusiasm despite our friendship warned me he would be hard to convince. He knew nothing of the exhibition’s history, and I couldn’t think of a good idea for what might entice him to participate. I was organising ‘Sonsbeek 93’ as a loose residency of sorts. This entailed an initial site visit by each artist — up to two weeks — concluding in a project proposal (or perhaps multiple proposals). If a proposal was agreed upon, this would be followed by a commitment of production money, fee and accommodation in Arnhem to develop the work over a period of time. I feared Mike might not have had the energy for this. It wasn’t even the way he worked — he wasn’t a site-specific artist.</p>
      <p>I remember we wandered through his home, which seemed like one big rambling studio that was half indoors and half outdoors, with materials everywhere, lots of plants, big props and seemingly no particular place designated for just living — at least in the conventional sense. We eventually made our way to an office area and sat on a couple of uncomfortable chairs. Instead of giving him my pitch, I began by asking questions. There was a picture of Heidi and a Swiss landscape pinned to a wall — a project he was working on with Paul McCarthy that would eventually become <italic>Heidi: Midlife Crisis Trauma Center and Negative Media-Engram Abreaction Release Zone</italic> (1992). There were other images too, some religious, and when I asked him what these were about, he shrugged his shoulders and said in a peeved voice, ‘This is an idea for a show that no one will let me do.’ I immediately reacted, ‘Why not do this show for Sonsbeek?’ I think he was a little taken aback — his entire demeanour changed and he began to get excited.</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>Why did Mike think no one would let him do this show? Was he talking about himself? Was he having doubts about whether it would work? About whether it even made sense to do such an exhibition — that is, to subsume a number of his friends under this grand scheme of his, ‘The Uncanny’? He may have had his doubts as to whether this was a good idea; whether the artists would agree to be included; and, in the end, whether it might be too much work and take him away from his studio. Perhaps our talk that day was a provocation, although I didn’t sense this at the time. Perhaps it only became a challenge directed at me after, as we got on with an increasingly ambitious exhibition checklist and catalogue.</p>
      <p>Since Mike did not create site-specific work, offering to host the exhibition in the Gemeentemuseum<sup>3</sup> was as close to the criteria of site-specificity as I could get to justify his participation — a ‘sited’ exhibition performing as an artwork within the larger ‘Sonsbeek 93’ exhibition.<sup>4</sup> In jest he called it ‘an old-fashioned, “conservative” museum exhibition’,<sup>5</sup> yet something of that atmosphere was deliberately cultivated in ‘The Uncanny’, no doubt helped by the Gemeentemuseum’s extensive collection of the inter-War Dutch Magic Realist paintings Mike loved.<sup>6</sup> Occupying seven rooms, ‘The Uncanny’ broadly featured four typologies of artefacts: contemporary and historical artworks; medical, educational and scientific models, including taxidermies and preserved human parts; photographs, both fine art and documentary, as well as blow-ups of artworks unavailable for the show; and Mike’s personal collections of things, which he called <italic>The Harems</italic>. The theoretical thrust behind ‘The Uncanny’ resided in Mike’s interest in the Freudian idea of sublimation or ‘repressed memory syndrome’, i.e. the threat of a repressed event that surfaces but is refused expression and is thus forced to manifest in strange ways. Toying with the uncanny in his own work, he sought out historical examples in realist polychrome figurative sculpture, while also recognising a similar impulse in much contemporary art. Over twenty artists were featured, including Hans Bellmer, Nayland Blake, Jonathan Borofsky, Jacques Charlier, John De Andrea, Robert Gober, Duane Hanson, Martin Kippenberger, Jeff Koons, Tetsumi Kudo, Dorothea Lange, Paul McCarthy, John Miller, Matt Mullican, Bruce Nauman, Dennis Oppenheim, Tony Oursler, Nam June Paik, Thom Puckey, Charles Ray, Karl Schenker, Cindy Sherman, Laurie Simmons, Kiki Smith and Paul Thek, among others.</p>
      <p>Writing for <italic>The Guardian</italic> on the occasion of a new version of ‘The Uncanny’ at Tate Liverpool in 2004, art critic Adrian Searle asked, ‘is “The Uncanny” a Mike Kelley show, or a show curated — straight-faced — by Mike Kelley?’<sup>7</sup> In response, I would say that in its first incarnation in Arnhem, ‘The Uncanny’ was a work by Mike Kelley. The subsequent versions at Tate Liverpool and at the Museum moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig (mumok) in Vienna, also in 2004, became exhibitions curated by Mike Kelley.<sup>8</sup> Why an artist curates an exhibition is a question that demands a nuanced and complex answer. It can be simply a response to the need to show with like-minded friends and artists around pressing ideas. In ‘The Uncanny’, however, Mike was not only setting a context for his work, but very self-consciously presenting a corrective to the public’s reading of him and his work at the time. In this sense, ‘The Uncanny’ attempted to coalesce the psychological and existential affinities around a group of artists, just as Douglas Crimp’s ‘Pictures’ show had defined a generation of artists involved with appropriation, authorship and authenticity over a decade before.<sup>9</sup>

      <p>Mike was always clear about his reasons for doing this exhibition. It began, in part, with a profound fascination with the human figure, followed by a more reflective view on this fascination. To a certain extent, it was a response to recent shows at the time, such as Jeffrey Deitch’s ‘Post Human’ (1992–93),<sup>10</sup> which dealt with technological evolution and genetic engineering to improve the construction of our bodies and personalities with the aim of creating superhumans — promoting the ‘Me generation’ on a global scale.<sup>11</sup> Despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that Mike was included in ‘Post Human’, he reacted against Deitch’s concept of body commodification as the zeitgeist. ‘The Uncanny’ offered a more demanding psychological perspective — a critique sited at the intersection of metaphysics, ontology and the belief systems that surround the relations between objects and human beings.</p>
      <p>Formally, he was interested in dealing with the confusion between the animate and inanimate from the point of view of realist sculpture. He made recourse to Salvador Dalí’s and René Magritte’s justifications for working in a realist style, suggesting that they had responded to modernist abstraction by pushing realism to an extreme; that is, by dealing in ‘an outmoded technique’ with clichés that could be rearranged with playful perversity.<sup>12</sup> Similarly, Mike’s case for the re-emergence of realist sculpture in the 1990s looked beyond realism for its own sake to focus instead on the presence of a disturbing quality in the viewer’s encounter with the physical object. The invocation to realism might be a response to a feeling that his work had not been properly theorised by critics of his generation, and that the particular conceptual approach of his alma mater, the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), had too narrowly absorbed the art scene at this time.<sup>13</sup>

      <p>Why ignore painting? Mike simply responded more to sculpture’s physicality, and he wanted ‘to focus on one particular feeling, that IS body conscious: that you are matter and objects are matter.’<sup>14</sup> He claimed that a small revival of realist sculpture existed precisely because it had become ‘SO DEAD’ and that contemporary artists wanted ‘the wonderful feeling of making a corpse walk.’<sup>15</sup> He felt strongly that without a discourse sculpture wasn’t taken seriously and was still considered, in the early 1990s, ‘stupid’ in comparison to painting, which was all about the mind and hence completely detached from the physical. He referred to sculpture’s historical attempts to create material substitutes for life, and failures in creating the suspension of disbelief that painting had achieved. And he was constantly frustrated with the lingering, looming thought that figurative sculpture, with its waxy and churchy past, had been and might always be considered kitsch. Mike saw literalness, like academic art, as an enemy to the post-conceptual dominant art world, and the idea that he could resuscitate this dead art form to triumph over that world is, in part, what drove his motivation for ‘The Uncanny’.</p>
      <p>Most importantly, Mike treated the exhibition a bit like an experiment, which I would argue makes ‘The Uncanny’ more about his work — a kind of studio-in-exhibition-form or exhibition-as-extension-of-the-studio, rather than a strictly traditional exhibition. He wanted to see what happened when he juxtaposed modern and contemporary works with earlier, highly emotive figures and statues, in addition to what he called ‘literalist’ works, such as demonstration models, preserved human parts and petrified things. He questioned whether contemporary sculpture could evoke a sense of death on top of its sense of life, as in the older pieces. Or did contemporary art’s self-consciousness make it fall into what some critics coined a ‘pathetic’ sensibility?<sup>16</sup> Pathetic or not, Mike was convinced that these juxtapositions of old and new would result in what Freud had identified as the uncanny.</p>
      <p>Mike specifically identified with verisimilitude before modernism, when the figure embodied symbolic values, such as religious sentiment or spirituality, and provoked an emotional response from the viewer — now lost to a jaded contemporary art world. A statue representing a historical or mythological figure, such as a terracotta warrior buried with Chinese Emperor Qín Shǐ Huángdì (c.210 BCE) or a figure of the ‘Weeping Virgin Mary’ made in New Orleans in the 1980s — both included in ‘The Uncanny’ — transcends its own materiality to such an extent that it becomes animate to believers. The converse was, for example, a blow-up photograph showing the German dancer Olga Desmond posing nude as a classical work of art — or rather, as marble coming to life — in her performance ‘Schönheitsabende’ (‘Evenings of Beauty’), in Berlin in 1908. The metaphysical transmogrification from the inanimate to the animate and back again necessitates the emotional response that Mike sought but was hard pressed to find amidst a materialist culture that consumed everything in a detached way. He wanted to shake the complacency of the people who came in contact with his work: it was important that a person could physically relate to or ‘empathise in a human way’ with the objects.<sup>17</sup>
      </p>
      <p>This immediately makes one think of Michael Fried’s critical remarks on the theatricality of artistic experience when looking at ‘literalist’ or Minimalist sculpture, which Mike took in an entirely different direction.<sup>18</sup> ‘The Uncanny’ did not exactly offer theatre, but instead aimed to produce ‘disturbing’ and ‘<italic>unrecallable</italic> memories . . . provoked by a confrontation between “me” and “it” that was highly charged, so much so that “me” and “it” become confused.’<sup>19</sup> This is why Mike argued that uncanny feelings are not modernist, postmodernist or pre-modernist; he defined the uncanny instead as being ‘probably as old as art itself’.<sup>20</sup> I would argue that it is even older, and actually has nothing to do with art at all, but pre-art and pre-language. The experience that Mike sought to convey in ‘The Uncanny’ can be perhaps better grasped through anthropologist Michael Taussig’s description of witnessing a shaman resuscitate a person close to death: he writes about the energy waves between them as a ‘sheer becoming in which being and non-being are transformed into the beingness of transforming forms’.<sup>21</sup> This ‘beingness’ would be produced by an intense ‘physical connection’ or ‘fluidity’ with the object, a desire to enter into it to the point where subject and object are no longer distinguishable. This process is at the very core of the creative act; it is about artifice and the suspension of disbelief.</p>
      <p>Mike proposed that a resuscitated realist academicism brought back into the contemporary belied not only an attraction to something that is dead, but a desire for the forbidden — the taboo — precisely because of its uncool status in the art world. He consciously moved towards an inflected orthodoxy of the figure, because it was at once alive and not alive, animate and inanimate; for him it occupied this liminal place, weaving between illusion and reality — an area Mike liked to work in. As he said in an interview with Thomas McEvilley, ‘there’s also this strange attraction to something that is forbidden. Figurative art is itself like a corpse or mummy, and you want to resuscitate this forbidden thing and bring it back to life because it is bad.’<sup>22</sup> Even the word ‘bad’ is ambiguous. ‘Bad, bad’ or ‘bad, good’? Either way, at this preliminary stage in our understanding of Mike Kelley’s work as ‘the show he wanted to do, but nobody would let him’, we must consider the context he was fighting against. Mike was sensitive about people labelling him as a ‘bad boy of the art world’, and his work as camp, kitsch or postmodern. ‘Camp’, he said, ‘implies superiority and in control, uncanny denies that.’ He wanted people ‘to be affected by the images on a biological level.’<sup>23</sup> He was aiming for a reaction of repulsion, which would in turn indicate belief in the power of the object, and thus thwart the market and devouring public. But he refused to acknowledge his achievements, his success was both a disappointment and not enough, and it consumed him. The sculptural work Mike included in ‘The Uncanny’ was broadly of human scale. The sheer physical presence of these works achieved a visceral effect on the viewer, whereas he believed miniatures obliged people to project an imaginary scenario onto the object by losing themselves in it. Historical precedents shown in the exhibition included the true-to-life figures of Duane Hanson, Jacques Charlier, John De Andrea and Thom Puckey, all of whom used verisimilitude, although in different ways. The installations <italic>Peinture Tragique</italic> (<italic>Tragic Painting</italic>, 1991) and <italic>True Light</italic> (1987), by Charlier and Puckey respectively, relate to the tableau vivant, while Hanson’s and De Andrea’s 1960s ‘New Realism’ bridged Mike’s idea of imitation. De Andrea, for example, worked with newspaper photographs of news events that he translated into black-and-white sculptures — a transference invested not in a ‘truth to materials’ but in literalness. These earlier contributions were not to be confused with the perversity inherent in the post-conceptual verism of John Miller’s and Charles Ray’s figures, which they embedded in expressionist paintings and minimalist sculptures, respectively, to awkward impression. Of Ray’s <italic>Male Mannequin</italic> (1990), Mike wrote that men have genitals, mannequins don’t, so when you put genitals on a mannequin ‘morals are revealed as determined by convention’.<sup>24</sup> Sex undoes the standard, and defamiliarises the object, rendering it suspect and strange.</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>Not to be dismissed on Mike’s list was polychrome statuary, particularly because the genre was passé, relegated to the lowest level of artistic practice. In this discussion, he invoked Edgar Degas’s <italic>Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans</italic> (<italic>Little Dancer Aged Fourteen</italic>, 1880–81), although it was not included in the exhibition, as one of the few examples of nineteenth-century colour statues said to be inspired by shop-window displays, for which coloured wax was used in astonishingly realistic ways.<sup>25</sup> He also talked of the ‘Greek prejudice’ generated by the modern misconception that ancient Greek sculpture was colourless, for which he blamed the academic notion of ‘truth to materials’ that maintained colour to be a false illusion.<sup>26</sup> For Mike these formal biases underscored the timeless order of neoclassicism as class prejudice, colour on statuary being associated with kitsch and ‘made for and consumed by the underclasses’, whom he often invoked.<sup>27</sup> Mike included one of the Emperor Qín Shǐ Huángdì’s warriors in ‘The Uncanny’ because it demonstrated an early example of mass-manufactured funereal portrait sculpture: cheap terracotta replacements for actual human soldiers. He equated this practice with the beginning of kitsch, whereby the object acquires a dispensable quality. This throwaway aspect, however, is repressed when an object or a fragment is charged with the task of healing. And ironically this is precisely where Koons’s polychrome wood sculpture <italic>Ushering in Banality</italic> (1988) enters into ‘The Uncanny’. Mike believed Koons’s work made historical referents overtly kitsch so that they would flash the message ‘cultural products can control you . . . you <italic>are</italic> them, whether you like it or not’.<sup>28</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Tony Oursler’s early finger-puppet video dramas and psychological video projections on stuffed cloth effigies and other surfaces fit closely with Mike’s sensibility. The affinity between the two was carried through special-effects models, sadly only represented in blow-up photographs in ‘The Uncanny’. The props and models attracted Mike because they were alive in film but ‘dead’ outside it. At the home of Forest J. Ackerman, editor of the fanzine <italic>Famous Monsters of Filmland</italic> (1958–83/1993–2008) and collector of special-effects objects, Mike got to walk among models that recalled his memories of watching horror films and science fiction on television as a youth. Of the experience, he wrote that ‘they were too familiar, as intensely felt memory’ to remain merely objects; they insisted on their own reality.<sup>29</sup> No doubt Ackerman’s collection more than any other triggered the return of the repressed that fuelled Mike’s vision.<fig id="fg4" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>The relationship between the fragment and the whole as a formal and theoretical issue begins in the exhibition with Mike’s inclusion of a blow-up image of Auguste Rodin’s drawer containing plaster casts of human limbs. He may have known that Sigmund Freud shared with Rodin a love of antiquities,<sup>30</sup> and was certainly aware that Rodin was inspired by the antique fragment as an emancipated object from the whole human body that could act more effectively as signifier for all of antiquity in its reduced state. Mike expanded these ideas through Paul Thek’s series <italic>Technological Reliquaries</italic> (1964–67), from which he included <italic>Warrior’s Leg</italic> (1966–67), clad with detailed antique armament, and <italic>Untitled</italic> (1967), an extended arm dressed with blue butterfly wings. Condensing pagan and Catholic pageantry, these objects allow the sensuality of their waxy simulated flesh underneath an intricate cover to manifest as fetish. Matched against Robert Gober’s gawky puritan schoolboy leg fragment sticking out from the bottom of the wall (<italic>Untitled</italic>, 1989) were Hans Bellmer’s <italic>Poupée</italic> photographs (1934–38), eerily sexualised female anatomical parts manipulated, as if with infinite possibility, to satisfy a scopic need to see the ‘body as anagram’.<sup>31</sup> For instance, mirrored-paired doll’s legs (up and down) joined at the pelvis, shod as a Catholic schoolgirl and propped against a tree in the woods provoked Mike to quote Bellmer, saying, ‘Desire, with respect to the intensity of images, is not in a perceptible whole but in the detail.’<sup>32</sup> Alongside Bellmer’s disturbing sex dolls, Mike included Cindy Sherman’s playful scatological photographs <italic>Untitled (Mannequin)</italic> (1992), a series that began with realistic anatomical parts reconstructed into abstraction to reveal a ‘juvenile fascination with things that are repulsive. [. . .] To think about why something repulses me,’ says Sherman, ‘makes me that much more interested in it. I feel that I have to explore it.’<sup>33</sup> Here the truncated body is subsumed under a playful game that is more spooky than sexual. Arranged at the end of the exhibition, <italic>The Harems</italic> were a significant and pivotal section of ‘The Uncanny’. They consisted of fourteen of Mike’s personal collections gathered throughout various phases of his life. Their presence in ‘The Uncanny’ was important in providing a critical commentary on the activity of collecting, art-making and the nature of objects. They were not meant to be finite collections, but open, live, working groups. I think of them as a built-in antidote to any possible misinterpretation of ‘The Uncanny’ by the public. Although Mike used the term ‘harem’ as ‘a fetishist’s accumulation of fetish objects’ and tied them to ‘Freud’s principal of a “repetition-compulsion”’,<sup>34</sup> the etymology of the word links them with a forbidden and sacrosanct place.<sup>35</sup> 
         <italic>The Harems</italic> were Mike’s muse and shield.<fig id="fg5" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>Mike wrote that he started collecting at the precocious age of five or six, initially marbles, fossils and rocks. Later objects such as baseball cards, comic books, bubble-gum cards and records were ‘pursued with great fervour’.<sup>36</sup> These objects took on meaning outside of the pure impulse to collect; they were desirable and he became attached to them. As an adult artist, however, Mike took a certain distance to collecting. His collections of shot glasses, ashtrays and smoking paraphernalia used in bars, for example, self-consciously play off of preadolescent preoccupations with accoutrements that legitimate and accept one into a society of the cool — a humorous biting comment on his earlier infantile collections. In addition to these, there are the business cards, an unorganised history of professionals who solicited his attention at one point in time and ‘were found stashed away in a kitchen drawer’.<sup>37</sup> I believe they re-entered his object kingdom to serve a critical function in ‘The Uncanny’: standing in for Mike’s encounters with real people from all walks of life, individuals reduced to one card among many. The levelling aspect to the business-card group underscores the raw humanity of this <italic>Harem</italic>. Here, the uncanniness is triggered by the memories associated with personal names and, in turn, individuals’ desires and disappointments — their lives presented like epitaphs in a cemetery.</p>
      <p>
         <italic>The Harems</italic> also included objects that Mike gathered for his artistic practice, such as the banners — images ripped out from pages of fashion and erotic magazines, comic books and postcards. The squeeze toys, on the other hand, are fascinating in part because they were bought as ‘percussion instruments’; Mike insists they had ‘no visual interest to him’.<sup>38</sup> Yet they are all of a certain type, uniformly designed and appearing like three-dimensional cartoons for babies or dogs. Mike said: ‘Popular culture is really invisible. People are really oblivious to it. But that’s the culture I live in and that’s the culture people speak. My interest in popular forms is not to glorify them, because I really dislike popular culture in most cases.’<sup>39</sup> We must take this statement with some reserve. Mike dove into this aesthetic with the full force of a Liberace leaving a trail of acolytes in his wake. If what he was after was a collection of unconventional percussion instruments, he could have picked up any number of readymades à la John Cage or Tony Conrad. But Mike chose this form, making their low-life qualifications considered and curatorial, despite his disavowals.</p>
      <p>What motivates these collections is not the fetishising impulse to hoard, but the intent to order, and perhaps less the intent to order than the desire to make sense of and control what is or was beyond control. Ephemera takes its place in the chaos of things. As possessions, <italic>The Harems</italic> provide a certain sense of governance over the overwhelming fragments of life, the revenge of the repressed manifest as order and power. For Mike, they provided solace, a salve for the world-weary artist.</p>
      <p>
         <italic>The Harems</italic> had a clear definition and sense of purpose. They were not only his personal contribution to ‘The Uncanny’ — despite the fact that he wanted to distance himself from this fact — but more importantly they provided a critique of the exhibition because they originated outside of art and thus acted as raw material. Mike included them because of their symbolic value as uncanny examples that ‘reflect the collecting impulse at various stages of my development’ and ‘consist of collections that span my entire life’, often ‘based completely on my subjectivity at that moment’.<sup>40</sup> In this sense, it would seem that we can understand them as autobiographical.</p>
      <p>In 1998, five years after ‘Sonsbeek 93’, Mike made an agreement with the collector Kourosh Larizadeh, allowing for the latter’s acquisition of all the historical photographs assembled for ‘The Uncanny’ and the gradual release of <italic>The Harems</italic> over a fifteen-year period. Because Mike felt <italic>The Harems</italic> were ‘not fixed or finite . . . [but] fluid’,<sup>41</sup> he initially allowed the collector to add to some of the groups, thereby completing collections he had left incomplete. However, when Larizadeh began adding to the ‘Outer Limits’ bubble-gum card series through sets bought on eBay, Mike realised that the omissions had been deliberate — that it had been his aesthetic choice all along, even as a preadolescent, to leave certain cards out simply because he didn’t like them. The subjective nature of <italic>The Harems</italic> and the astonishment he experienced when he saw the series completed, as if Larizadeh had gone into his past and changed his personal history, revealed how important the gaps were to his discourse on fragmentation and partiality, on exclusion and legitimation, and how they touched at the core of his practice. In his words, ‘the strange sense of loss and wonder attendant to the gaps in the collections is uncanny’.<sup>42</sup> So while we might think of <italic>The Harems</italic> as an exhibition within ‘The Uncanny’ exhibition, within the context of ‘Sonsbeek 93’ they were driven by artistic rather than curatorial choices.</p>
      <p>We can see similar gaps in <italic>Educational Complex</italic> (1995), a large architectural model with the floor plans of every school Mike attended. Appropriating the theory of repressed memory syndrome, which emerged from working with toys and afghans and remained with him in various ways until his last works, Mike allowed the holes in his memories of his schooling to stand in for spaces that would betray abuse.<sup>43</sup> Is it too far-fetched to say that the gaps in his preadolescent and adolescent <italic>Harems</italic> were also significant as absent markers, if not for abusive events then for a kind of truancy: an assertion of aesthetic individuality against the convention of completing collections? At a certain moment these holes became more psychologically potent for Mike than the collections themselves.<sup>44</sup> The absence of certain items in all the collections was employed perhaps unconsciously at first, then consciously to act in a disruptive way, revealing Mike’s thought processes, his likes and dislikes, his obsessions with his own past, which were, in part, a response to his context. The personal and private touch of <italic>The Harems</italic> provided the perfect counterpoint to Mike’s studied, scholarly and near encyclopaedic approach elsewhere in ‘The Uncanny’. They come closest to the arrangements of pictures I saw on his pinboards in his studio in 1992, and are clearly at the centre of his argument. We can especially see this operating in the grouping <italic>Six Bent Coat Hangers and One Antenna Used to Break into Cars (Harem No. 5)</italic>. For the most part all of <italic>The Harems</italic> followed acceptable standards as objects for collection. Only the stretched-out wire hangers, prominently laid out, suggesting tools for another type of forced entry, and coveted by Larizadeh,<sup>45</sup> are odd in their sinister implications, going beyond the vernacular and the kitsch characteristic of the other <italic>Harems</italic>.<fig id="fg6" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>In 2004, Mike realised that to allow a collector to build upon his collections was largely an ‘unconscious’ and ‘unreflective’ attitude to adopt.<sup>46</sup> Yet, for the new introduction to ‘The Uncanny’ for its incarnations at Tate Liverpool and mumok, he wrote that the ‘strange kind of psychic relationship’ between artist and collector ‘fascinated’ him as the most interesting aspect in the entire project.<sup>47</sup> I can only imagine that it fascinated him in the same way Faust was fascinated by his relationship with Mephistopheles.<fig id="fg7" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>The museological process that went into effect in order to release the work from the collector for public viewing meant, for Mike, that the collections were eventually ‘misread as some kind of personal archive or giant assemblage . . . antithetical to [his] intentions’.<sup>48</sup> In the end, <italic>The Harems</italic> became artworks,<sup>49</sup> and in so doing, although Mike did not say this, lost their power to be uncanny. Or at least, I believe that this was Mike’s fear. And so the artist seems to have resigned himself to the fact that once things of personal value leave the private realm ‘for an existence in the world outside of [his] control’, they take on other meanings — sadly, even ones that the artist may not desire.<sup>50</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Is ‘The Uncanny’ an artwork or a work of curatorial craftsmanship? I believe at a certain point the one became the other. And that point was when Mike stopped owning the idea and, with it, lost the magical moment of recognition that he had something he was in full possession of physically and intellectually, which had yet not entirely revealed itself to him, and so remained ambiguous, somewhat abstract — a mysterious thing that held his attention. Once this had been articulated, over-articulated and even franchised,<sup>51</sup> did it lose its magic and become something else? Less powerful? Less interesting? Perhaps. Certainly it became less innocent.</p>
