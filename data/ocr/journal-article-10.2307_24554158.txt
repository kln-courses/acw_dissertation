Ovid is so beautiful; you can't think of anything that's more interesting and full of references. I was just so impressed by it. , And then the different versions I found really fascinating. KS It's so funny because it's this classical foundation that we take for granted as being a given, and yet there are so many different versions of the given. BB And the different versions about the flower, and what it means, symbolizes. KS I also thought it was interesting that the narcissus plant is poisonous. Another thing I loved were the stamps. At first I didn't even notice the thumbprint; it was this blue splotch that went right past me, and then I looked at it and realized that's great, because that's like birth records, and criminal records. I thought it was so witty. And then there's the signature up the side that I didn't notice either. There's so much going on in this stamp. BB I think what I'm going to do is have the stamps for sale as well. KS In a separate edition? BB Yes. KS Were they also printed in Germany? BB Yes. They turned out very well; I'm very happy with them. They're pretty creepy.

I'm very happy with Ghostwriter—the piece in the beginning I almost called "The End" because it's really about how you end some thing, and I have real difficulty ending or leaving things, saying this is the final "it." That's what that piece was also about—how do you get to the end of something—you fade out, or whatever. And the book itself doesn't really have an end; it goes somewhere and &gt; then it flips over and starts again. I don't like to finish things; I don't like them to be the definite, final version.
