Huntington, explorer Americans expected to create civilization in the wilderness; they just felt that they could skip Castle Valley. From the beginning of history, no  one really liked the area: not the Utes, not the Spanish, not the Mexicans,  nor the mountain men, nor the federal surveyors—not even the pioneers  who eventually settled there. When Oliver Huntington penned his views  in 1855, the valley’s name and its unattractive reputation were both well  established. Its dry, alkali soil and gullied landscape initially made only a  convenient passageway in what became the American West. From the mid- thirteenth to the late nineteenth centuries, however, no one lived there  permanently. The Utes, true, once traveled regularly through Castle Valley  in their seasonal cycles through the greater southwest, leaving possessions  at favorite campsites. In 1921, for example, a local schoolgirl’s interviews  with “old-timers” revealed that, “The early settlers . . . found poles of wig- wams, pottery, weapons, Indian graves, bead work and rocks where they  ground their corn.”2 Further south, circles of stones used to weigh down the  sides of teepees and scattered pieces of broken pottery marked other old  Ute campsites.3 But these sites had been abandoned, perhaps because the  Utes, like all other natives, had suffered greatly from epidemics introduced  by whites, who had a resistance that Indians lacked.4 Furthermore, the local  environment had apparently deteriorated in historic times. One pioneer  account related that although Utes “didn’t approve of white settlers [in  Castle Valley,] . . . because their own squaws became sick from drinking the  7 </page> <page sequence="4"> 8 Castle Valley Corridor water, they would not live here.”5 Permanent settlement came only at the command of the LDS Church  (the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or Mormons). In that,  Castle Valley was not distinctive—virtually all of Utah and parts of Idaho,  Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, California, Canada, and Mexico were settled  likewise. But within a handful of years after the fi rst farmers scratched the  soil for fi elds and irrigation canals, the Denver and Rio Grande Western  Railroad built right through the valley. The railroad brought industry, a  cash economy, and a fl ood of non-Mormon immigrants from all parts of  Europe and Asia. From then on, American history ran on fast-forward  through the Castle Valley corridor. This isolated, rural-industrial center of  Utah, itself a most distinctive state, quickly became very different from its  immediate surroundings but very like much of the rest of the country. In  quick succession, Castle Valley fulfi lled all the expectations of the passing  age: exploration, pioneering, industrialization, immigrant adjustment, na- tional boom and bust, Cold War development, an internationally-driven  economy, and modern tourism. Yet it remains, to this day, geographically  isolated. Other areas have a polyglot population and the trials of industry;  most such are near urban centers. Plenty of America remains rural and  traditional, but residents do not have to interact with a host of others from  different traditions. None of the potentially comparable areas lie within  Utah, a state that began as a separate nation: economically cooperative,  polygamous, and theocratic. For this reason, a study of how forces and hu- mans created today’s Castle Valley, Utah, refl ects a unique view of national  aspirations as they played out in the most distinctive rural valley in America.  Nowhere else was so diverse but so isolated, so industrialized but so rural, so  fraught with labor disturbances yet leavened with religious tolerance. Castle  Valley had all these qualities, because that is what people had to do to get  along in this strange, remarkable place.  At fi rst, Castle Valley was easy to ignore. Its natural barriers kept it sepa- rate from the rest of Utah. On the west, the Wasatch Plateau rises to some  7,500–10,000 feet above sea level, dividing the western Basin and Range  Province, with its salt fl ats and Great Salt Lake, from the more eastern  red rock Colorado Plateau, home of Castle Valley.6 From north to south,  the Plateau’s heights give rise to fi ve major, perennial, eastward-fl owing  streams: Huntington, Cottonwood, Ferron, Muddy, and Ivie creeks, the last  a tributary of the Muddy. The fi rst three of these creeks drain into the San  Rafael River, which fl ows westward out of Castle Valley, cutting spectacular  canyons in the northern reaches of the San Rafael Swell. This uranium- rich geological uplift houses secret springs, water pockets, and fantastic  rocky shapes with weird names bestowed by lonely cowboys and defi nes the  valley’s southeastern edge. The San Rafael River’s snaking course echoes  that of the more northerly Price River, which enters Castle Valley through  a canyon separating the Wasatch Plateau from an east-to-west-running pile  </page> <page sequence="5"> Passing Through, 1776–1869 9 Castle Valley’s ancient inhabitants left intriguing traces, including unfi red, mud fi gurines, paint- ed rock art that sometimes resembled them, and pecked-in images portraying recognizable  animals and fantastic fi gures, such as these at Rochester Creek, near Moore, Emery County.

(Northwest of this region lies Utah’s dom- inant Wasatch Front, contrasting with the “backside of the Wasatch Front,”  where Castle Valley lies.)7 The Price River fl ows down through its canyon  and southeast through Castle Valley (through a portion also known as Clark  Valley), watering two or three tiny meadows amid a vast expanse of alkali  and dirt until it, too, curves east to join the Green River. To the south and  southwest, cradling the Swell, lies the San Rafael Desert, completing the  circle around this remote area where the last dinosaurs once came to die.8 Castle Valley’s last known, permanent, human inhabitants had been  the Fremont Indians, an understudied group who inhabited the area  </page> <page sequence="6"> 10 Castle Valley Corridor over a thousand years ago. Fields of cultivated corn, beans, and squash  generally grew near their clusters of pit-houses which sheltered extended  family groups. Using stone tools, they fashioned unique hide moccasins  with dew claw hobnails, rabbit-skin garments, and clothing made of  tanned deer hides. They left behind gray and black pottery and unfi red  clay anthropomorphic fi gurines. They also decorated nearby cliffs with  miles and miles of rock art whose meaning has been lost. Archaeologists,  however, speculate that the Fremont may have had a developed  shamanistic religion, featuring powerful fi gures with horned headdresses,  swords, and shields. The Fremont rock art also features numerous zigzags,  spirals, and stylized animals, including mountain sheep, deer, elk, and  snakes. Based on a total of only 1,300 excavated sites in 1979, the Utah  State Archaeologist “guesstimated” a peak aboriginal population around  1150 A.D. of somewhere around 50,000 inhabitants in Castle Valley. The  Fremont, however, started drifting away in a dry cycle beginning in 1215 and culminating in the Great Southwestern Drought of 1276–1299.9 For the next fi ve hundred years, Castle Valley appealed to few who saw  it. By the 1800s, the Utes had named the area Blow Valley for its swirling,  dusty winds. They avoided its poisonous water that killed horses and gave  Ute women “big necks” (goiter).10 Later called gyp water, (named after the  Gypsum Formation), it was “so hard that if soap fl akes were mixed in it, it  would curdle,” said a later rancher. He added, “A man can drink it for about  two days only; after that time, he has to avoid sudden moves.”11 In 1830, a hardy mountain man traveling through Utah to California summed up  the general opinion of Castle Valley: “the most desolate forlorn dell in the  world—Everything about it was repulsive and supremely awful.”12 Recorded history of the area began in 1776, a year currently better- known for an eloquent Declaration claiming independence for a ragged  scrap of Atlantic coast. At that time, however, the greatest New World em- pire lay to the south. Spain had fi rst grandiosely claimed Castle Valley in the  middle 1500s, although none of the Spanish had seen it. By the late 1700s, however, Spanish policy makers pushed to secure its North American bor- derlands against other expanding European nations, such as England and  France. Spanish offi cials in Mexico City sent an exploring party to forge a  road from its northernmost outpost, the 150–year-old pueblo of Santa Fe  (now in New Mexico), to its recently founded missions on the California  coast. On July 29, 1776, Fathers Francisco Anastasio Dominguez and Sil- vestre Velez de Escalante left Santa Fe at the head of a party attempting  to reach California. They never reached their intended destination, and  their journey sensibly circumvented Castle Valley. They traveled north of  it on their outward journey and, driven by winter, fl ed back to Santa Fe by  a more southerly route.13 Nonetheless, the Dominguez-Escalante Expedi- tion forecast a route that bisected Castle Valley, a route romantically (and </page> <page sequence="7"> Passing Through, 1776–1869 11 inaccurately) called the Old Spanish Trail because of their journey.  The Dominguez Escalante Expedition marked only one phase of human  movement into the Castle Valley area. As noted, Utes had made seasonal  forays, particularly when snow blanketed the surrounding highlands. United  by a common language, various Ute bands ranged widely over some 225,000 square miles in far-reaching arcs, throughout parts of Utah, Colorado,  Wyoming, and New Mexico. None of them centered on Castle Valley, how- ever, which remained at the fringes of several bands. The Pahvant Utes and  the San Pitch (or San Pete) bands throve west of Castle Valley; the Uintah  and the Tumpanawach (Timpanogos) Utes lived largely to the north. To the  southeast lived the Weeminuche, and, just north of them and due east of  Castle Valley, the Uncompahgre.14 Many other bands lay scattered through- out this vast area. In prehistoric times the Ute bands cycled leisurely through  their seasonal homes, but their lives changed with Spanish contact. Accord- ing to Ute historian Clifford Duncan, the “most important effect Spaniards  had on Ute life was to introduce them to the horse. The Ute bands in south- ern Colorado and southeastern Utah were the fi rst to obtain horses. The  more northern Ute groups acquired them later in the seventeenth and eigh- teenth centuries.”15 Horses increasingly allowed skilled Ute riders to sweep  into Castle Valley, deepening the Old Spanish Trail.  Despite their unfamiliarity with the Castle Valley portion of the Old  Spanish Trail itself, the Spanish had also made sporadic forays into nearby  Ute lands. They craved Ute-processed furs, and, most important, slaves,  used largely as servants in Santa Fe. In return, the Utes sought cattle hides,  a few imported goods, and prized Spanish horses. This trade was patently  illegal. Spain had outlawed the slave trade in 1589 and commercial contact  with the Utes in 1778, but commerce nonetheless continued.16 Therefore,  by 1805 an acculturated Ute known to the Spanish as Manuel Mestas was  able to negotiate the return of Spanish livestock stolen by the Comanches  and later won in battle by the Tumpanawach Utes. He probably traveled  through Castle Valley to broker the deal, and his example of intercultural  cooperation prefi gured one of the valley’s later hallmarks.17 Others may  have chanced over the local segment of the Old Spanish Trail. Records  are inconclusive, but perhaps Spanish citizens Mauricio Arze, Lagos Garcia,  and their party rushed eastward along its length, fl eeing murderous San  Pitch Utes in 1813. Bearing twelve slaves, they reached the Colorado River  and safety—but went to trial in Santa Fe for their illegal goods.18 Mountain men next pressed toward Castle Valley, driven by the Arikara  Wars further north and by continuing depletion of the beaver. Anecdotal  records mention Utah forays by William Becknell and Etienne Provost of  Taos in 1823–1824, and a British Hudson Bay Company brigade led by  Peter Skene Ogden arrived to the north in 1825.19 Legendary American  trapper Jedediah Smith came a year later and probably even visited Castle  </page> <page sequence="8"> 12 Castle Valley Corridor Valley. As he recorded in his journal:   . . .having learned that the valley was verry barren and Rocky I did not ven- ture into it. The country is here extremely rough little appearance of Indi- ans and game quite scarce a few Mt Sheep and Antelope. after traveling in  this direction 2 days the country looked so unpromising that I determined  to strike westward to a low place in the Mountain and cross over.20 Other trappers known to have been nearby included James Ohio and Syl- vester Pattie in 1828; William Wolfskill, Ewing Young, and William Huddart  (or Heddest), who trapped and ran pack trains, and William (or Julian)  Pope and Isaac Slover, who brought their Mexican wives and children over  the Old Spanish Trail in 1837. At the same time, mountain men Antoine  Robidoux and Dennis Julien ran a trading post to the northeast on the  Green River, leaving names scrawled on rocks: near future town of Green  River, “D. Julien, Mai 1836”; farther north, on the Roan Cliffs, “A. Robidoux,  1837,” and “Julien” again by Ivie Creek, west of Castle Valley.21 All of these adventurers had arrived in lands now controlled by Mex- ico, which had won independence from Spain in 1821. Free of Spanish  mercantilism, Mexico revamped its trade policies and opted for direct  trade between New Mexico and California. The fi rst two offi cial Mexican  trade caravans rolled along the Old Spanish Trail in 1830 and 1831, the  wooden wheels of their caretas creaking through the valley’s vastness. The  Utes reacted to this increasing traffi c through their lands by demanding  tribute, so Mexican traders formed ever larger and better-armed caravans  in an attempt to travel unmolested. Undaunted, Utes decided to get prized  Mexican horses at their source. By the 1830s, Utes began riding through  Castle Valley all the way to California. In cooperation with mountain men  Thomas “Pegleg” Smith and the African American James Beckwourth  (who knew the route), Ute leader Wakara (also known as Walker) and  his band of Tumpanawach Utes raided all along the Old Spanish Trail.22 By the 1840s, Utes appeared at ranchos near San Bernardino, California,  “with bells and gaudy trappings,” painted faces, “buckskin shirts, leggings,  and moccasins, beautifully marked with beads and porcupine quills [and]  with sometimes a single feather in their hair.”23 Reaching San Bernardino  itself in 1845, Wakara, with forty of his men and their families, traded  peacefully. Then, suddenly, the men rode whooping into the local herds,  swirling red and blue blankets over their heads, cutting out hundreds of  animals. Galloping north over California’s Cajon Pass, they drove the herd  east across the Mojave Desert, riding hundreds of miles more until they  crossed the Wasatch Plateau and entered Castle Valley. No one would fol- low them there. Inevitably, some of the horses escaped and, instinctively  fi nding good water, spread out in the San Rafael Swell and foaled future  generations. Meanwhile, Ute raids in California became so frequent that  </page> <page sequence="9"> Passing Through, 1776–1869 13 the route through the Mojave and over Cajon Pass became locally known  as Walker’s Trail.24 Outside events soon pushed a new breed of men through Castle Valley.  Just three years after Wakara’s fi rst daring raid, in 1848, Orville C. Pratt,  former lawyer and politician, became the fi rst United States offi cial to re- cord his impressions of the area. Following government orders, he went  west to Santa Fe and then took the Old Spanish Trail to California for a  confi dential meeting with the United States Consul in Monterey.25 Escorted  by sixteen experienced guides who provided basic security, Pratt (much  given to exclamations) noted on September 21, 1848, “The country con- tinues . . . sandy, hilly &amp; utterly barren. Water is also scarce, &amp; if there is no  mineral wealth in these mountains I can hardly conceive of what earthly  use a large proportion of this country was designed for!” Two days later bad  weather stopped his party on Ivie Creek, with “a terrifi c hail storm . . . [and  hail] as large as hens eggs!”26 Pratt then passed out of Castle Valley up over  the Wasatch Plateau and on toward California, suffering worn-out boots,  blistered, feet, and a body “alive with vermin!”27 But at Rancho Cucamonga  on October 23, he cheered at “the fi rst news of the discovery of gold. . . .  It seems incredible. . . . But, they insist here it is true.”28 Like thousands  of others he headed north, following the stories fi rst noted in the Janu- ary 1848 entry of former Mormon Battalion member Azariah Smith: “This  week, Mon. the 24th [date inserted later] Mr. Marshall found some pieces  of (as we all suppose) Gold. . . .”29 How did Mormon Battalion veterans get to Sutter’s Mill? Put briefl y,  they had fi rst walked all the way from Iowa to California in 1846–1847 to  fi ght Mexico for the United States. Meanwhile, their friends, neighbors,  and families were fl eeing westward to escape the very country for which  they fought. A fuller explanation involves the religious tempest of America’s  early nineteenth century. The LDS Church itself grew out of the great Prot- estant revival known as the Second Great Awakening, which swept western  New York’s Burned-Over District, home of young Vermont native Joseph  Smith.30 Smith’s revelations in the 1820s led to publication of the Book of  Mormon in 1830, and the foundation of the church he headed as both  President and living Prophet.31 Considering themselves “the chosen” over  their gentile (non-Mormon) neighbors, Mormons heeded Smith’s preach- ing, including the directive that “whosoever belongeth to my church need  not fear. . . . But . . .they who do not fear me, neither keep my command- ments . . . it is they that I will disturb, and cause to tremble and shake  to the center.”32 The animosity expressed here met its equal in their non- Mormon neighbors, spawning violence on both sides. The Saints, outnum- bered, fl ed westward—fi rst to Ohio’s Western Reserve, then to Missouri,  then to Nauvoo, Illinois. As historian Klaus Hansen observed, “By 1844 . . .  it had become all too obvious that Mormonism, because of its fundamental  antipluralist nature, would come into confl ict with a pluralistic American </page> <page sequence="10"> 14 Castle Valley Corridor society.”33 (Decades later, exactly the same tension would forever make  Castle Valley distinctive within Mormon Utah.) When an angry mob soon  killed Joseph Smith and his brother Hiram at the jail in Carthage, Illinois,  they exacerbated the split and created lasting martyrs for millennial Mor- monism. Despite a host of uncertainties, most of Smith’s former adherents  decided to follow the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the second layer  of LDS Church authority, and its president, Smith’s fellow Vermonter,  Brigham Young.34 In May 1845, the Smiths’ accused murderers were ac- quitted, and the Mormons no longer felt safe in Illinois.35 While tensions escalated, LDS leaders studied travelers’ reports of  the West, including California.36 The October 1845 general conference  (a semi-annual meeting to which all church members are invited) unani- mously voted to move westward—but where?37 A few reconnoitering par- ties set out: Sam Brannan slipped out of New York Harbor with a few vol- unteer Mormon families on February 4, 1846, on the ship Brooklyn, “with  a fl ag hoisted bearing as a blind the word ‘Oregon.’”38 He later insisted,  “The plans of the Mormon Church. . . . embraced an overland journey of  the main body under the leadership of President Brigham Young, whose  ultimate destination was announced to be California, . . . [following] the  voyage of a smaller number of an advance corps [Brannan’s group] by  the way of Cape Horn to Upper California.”39 Another expedition, the  so-called Mississippi Saints, got as far west as Pueblo, Colorado.40 Seem- ingly independently, Mormon Thomas Rhoades also headed overland, al- legedly “en route to the hunting grounds of California.”41 He may have  been hunting, all right, but not for furry animals. According to his family  history, “Thomas was made captain [in a typical LDS organization] over  a group of families.”42 His group of about forty people included his wife,  Elizabeth Foster Rhoades; their fourteen surviving children, some with  spouses, offspring, and in-laws; Mormon widow Lavina Murphy and her  seven children, two sons-in-law, and three grandchildren, a party guaran- teed to scare the animals. The family traveled part way in the company of  the infamous Donner Party, preceding them over the Sierra and into the  Sacramento Valley in 1846 after allegedly scouting the way west for the  LDS Church.43 By the time the Brannan and Rhoades parties arrived in California,  the international situation had deteriorated. On May 13, 1846, the United  States declared war on Mexico. American victory was a foregone conclu- sion. No longer could Mexican territory, specifi cally California, be a safe  haven for the Saints, but the main body of the faithful still had to move west- ward, away from the states and their anti-Mormon powers. Therefore, in  1846, LDS leaders issued a church call for 500 men who would fi ght for the  United States in the Mormon Battalion and donate their enlistment money  to pay for the church’s travel westward. The Battalion members marched all  the way to California, cutting a new road and observing the territory along  </page> <page sequence="11"> Passing Through, 1776–1869 15 the way.44 They sensibly avoided the Old Spanish Trail and Castle Valley in  preference for a southern route. The Battalion mustered out at San Diego on July 16, 1847. The men  scattered, some reenlisting, others heading over the Sierra to fi nd their  families until they received orders to return to California so they would  not come east empty-handed. Some sought work at Sutter’s Fort, including  journal-keeper Azariah Smith and shoemaker Orlando Mead, who would  later help colonize Castle Valley.45 American emigrants had begun gather- ing near the fort, so Swiss entrepreneur Johan Sutter decided to construct a  sawmill to provide planks for houses, preferred by the Americans over tradi- tional California adobes. He sent his carpenter, John Marshall, east on the  American River (aptly named) with eight former Battalion members and a  contingent of Indians under the supervision of Peter and Elizabeth Wimmer.46 In short order, in the brand new millrace, the men discovered gold. The timing was perfect. Fighting between the United States and Mexico  had ceased, and the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo was signed in February  1848, before the golden secret leaked out. In April, Kit Carson galloped  east along the Castle Valley corridor, carrying Sam Brannan’s April 1, 1848, California Star in his saddlebags which announced the gold discovery to all  the world.47 Soon an estimated fi fty thousand souls wandered the Mother  Lode. Families were the rule in the mines, including the Rhoades brothers,  who had lost but one brother-in-law in the war against Mexico. Unfortu- nately, matriarch Elizabeth Foster Rhoades had then succumbed to illness  and was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere near Benecia, when the  man who promised to erect a marker absconded with the money Rhoades  had given him for the purpose. She left behind a host of children, includ- ing eleven-year old Caleb, future Castle Valley colonizer.48 Members of the  Rhoades family joined Battalion members (including Orlando Mead) some  twenty-fi ve miles down river from Sutter’s mill on a huge, unclaimed sand- bar, soon known as the fabulously rich Mormon Island, one of the rich- est placer (loose gold) deposits in world history.49 In one week alone the  Rhoadeses amassed $17,000. Their total take has never been recorded.50 While Americans fought Mexicans, the LDS Church under Brigham  Young had established themselves in the Salt Lake Basin in 1847. In the fall  of 1848, Young commanded the California Saints to “gather to Zion” and  bring their gold to the LDS Church.51 Thomas Rhoades, accompanied by  Caleb, a younger sister, and two grandchildren, became the richest Mormon  to comply.52 When Thomas reached Utah, he deposited $10,826 in the  gold dust accounts maintained by Brigham Young, leaving a remainder  of $6,174 for himself.53 In exchange for the sacks of gold, one of which  allegedly weighed sixty pounds, Young “allowed him to withdraw from the  tithing offi ce all the food supplies necessary. He also received a herd of  cattle in consideration for the gold dust” and subsequently married fi ve  wives in polygamy.54 President Young also made a cautionary example of  </page> <page sequence="12"> 16 Castle Valley Corridor him in 1850, referring to “Father Rhoades” as “the wealthiest man who  came from the [California] mines . . . with $17,000, [but] could he buy  the possessions I had made in one year? It will not begin to do it. . . . and  again, look at the widows that have been made, and see the bones that lie  bleaching and scattered over the prairies.”55 Nonetheless, Brigham Young  wished to control California under reliable LDS authorities, having broken  with Sam Brannan, the original leader of the Saints there. Mormon wagon  trains rolled westward in 1849.56 That November 3 another train, organized  by two merchants from Missouri, hired some Mormon drivers, including  Edwin Pettit, his brother-in-law, David Seely, and David’s younger brother,  Justus Wellington Seely, father of future Castle Valley colonizers, Orange,  Sarah, and Justus Wellington II. On this particular trip, Orange and Sarah  were left behind in Salt Lake with their mother, Clarissa Jane Wilcox Seely,  who delivered Justus Wellington II (or Wink) during his father’s absence.57 Thus, Castle Valley’s main pioneer leaders—Caleb Rhoades and Orange  Seely—were together at the Salt Lake fort that winter, though no one has  recorded if they met.  Even before the wagon trains set out, LDS authorities had formulated  a new Utah government. In the spring of 1849, they created the state  of Deseret, headed by the same men who controlled the LDS Church,  a genuine theocracy. On paper at least, Deseret embraced an area from  western Colorado into northwestern New Mexico, to Arizona north of  the Gila River, California east of the Sierra and south of the Tehachapis,  as well as parts of Oregon, Idaho, and Wyoming. The U.S. Congress, on  the other hand, established in 1850 the territory of Utah, encompassing a  much smaller area: all of present-day Utah, western Colorado, and most of  Nevada. These dual governments began a contest over who governed, how  much territory, and for what purposes. The rivalry between national and  theocratic authority would develop into an overt LDS American contest  that would affect Castle Valley settlement more than two decades later.58 To make matters worse, in 1852 the LDS Church publicly announced  plural marriage (one man, several wives) as a tenet of its faith. Although  practiced in private for probably two decades, this public announcement  doomed the Saints’ repeated requests for statehood. Nonetheless, they  tried: by memorial in 1852, 1853, 1854, and, fi nally, with a constitutional  convention in 1856–1857.59 In the other states of the Union, plural mar- riage constituted bigamy, a criminal offense. But since states regulated mar- riage, admitting Utah to the Union would protect this “peculiar institution.”  Consequently, Congress had no intention of granting Utah statehood until  its leaders outlawed polygamy, an unlikely event in light of Utah’s theo- cratic government, also anathema to America at large. Thus, battle lines  became drawn around these two, interlocking issues.  While politicians fretted briefl y about the Mormons, the whole nation  thrilled to the excitement of California gold. Hundreds of thousands of  </page> <page sequence="13"> Passing Through, 1776–1869 17 foreigners raced to the gold fi elds: men (and a few women) from Mexico  and Chile; Ireland and Australia; Russia, China, France, and Great Britain.  Americans from the East went, too—and had to sail around the Horn (three  months) or ride muleback across the Central American isthmus (quicker,  but malarial) or take a wagon train across the country (four to six months).  Not only did foreigners pose a threat to U.S. control, but the nation needed  California gold to coin money in those pre-paper days. The country need- ed a railroad. Congress heartily agreed, but the precise route across the  continent became a political fi restorm. Every powerful American politician  wanted the eastern terminus in his own state or section, so his constituents  could be nearest the gold arriving at the end of the line.60 One of the loudest promoters of his favorite route was Senator Thomas  Hart Benton of Missouri, the father-in-law of explorer John C. Fremont.  Benton supported building along a line that ran directly west from St. Louis  (in his home state, of course) to San Francisco Bay—which took it right  through the Castle Valley corridor.61 At a St. Louis railroad convention in  1849, Senator Benton eloquently proclaimed: Let us beseech the national legislature to build a great road upon the great  national line which unites Europe and Asia—the line which will fi nd on  our continent the Bay of San Francisco at one end, St. Louis in the middle,  the National metropolis [Washington, D.C.] and great commercial empo- rium at the other end. In case anyone missed his point he concluded, “There is the East—there is  India.”62 Suddenly, Castle Valley—located, by chance, at roughly the same  latitude as St. Louis and Sacramento—was on a line that would girdle the  world. This route, of course, existed only in Senator Benton’s imagination  until proper surveys could be made. Even then, actual construction began  only after the Civil War had eliminated from Congress the powerful South- ern bloc, who favored a New Orleans terminus. In the meantime, several  men jockeyed for positions on the all-important survey parties, now that  science, not politics, would allegedly decide the route. On March 2, 1853, Congress fi nally passed a Pacifi c Railroad Bill to  fund speedy railroad surveys, with reports due—in dizzying haste—by  January 1854. Among the four routes under study, Senator Benton particu- larly championed that along the 38th parallel, and favored his son-in-law  as the head of the expedition. Instead, the nod went to Lt. John Williams Gunnison who had previously served in Utah in the 1850 Stansbury expedi- tion, which mapped the Great Salt Lake. Fremont, who had had his own  western experiences, attracted private fi nancial backers.63 Another govern- ment expedition under the direction of E. F. Beale, newly-appointed Su- perintendent of Indian Affairs for California (to deal with other problems  caused by the fl ood of gold-seekers), set off fi rst along the 38th parallel  </page> <page sequence="14"> 18 Castle Valley Corridor route in July 1853. Beale’s party, all traveling horseback, simply followed  the well-worn Old Spanish Trail through Castle Valley. His diarist and artist, Gwin Harris Heap, left a succinct description: “The trail led us over low  hills much cut up by dry and rocky ravines, and on our right were sand- stone bluffs. Vegetation was scanty, principally dwarf cedars, artemisia, and  cactus, and occasionally patches of gramma grass. We found no water from  camp to camp.”64 Gunnison’s more elaborate expedition included experts  to make scientifi c observations and lots of equipment. Hauling their sup- plies in wagons, his men had to cut a wider road clear across the continent.  Dr. James Schiel, the party’s physician, looked west at Castle Valley in early October 1853, just before they crossed the Green River. He pronounced it  “a wild and unproductive country . . . [where nothing is] likely to diminish  the gloom of this view.”65 After crossing the river, they veered off the Old  Spanish Trail and headed north, seeking watering spots for their teams.  They reportedly reached the Price River near the present site of Welling- ton, then turned southwest to meet the original route again near Hunting- ton Creek, creating the northern route, or the Gunnison cut-off, of the Old  Spanish Trail.66 Exploring as they went, some men proffered “specimens of  coal . . . from the hills near the camp,” according to the expedition’s chroni- cler, Lt. E. G. Beckwith. “Capt. Gunnison and Dr. Schiel . . . [differed] in  opinion as to its quality.”67 That mineral, then so drab compared to Califor- nia gold, would eventually become Castle Valley’s main economic support. The Gunnison party pressed on across this inhospitable terrain, fearing  Indian attacks.68 The Utes had reason for hostility. They had been trading  with New Mexicans, Californians, and mountain men for decades, some of  them following the seasonal route that took them from Utah to California  and back. Recently, Mormon colonists had taken choice lands, especially  near Utah Lake, northwest of Castle Valley. To support themselves, the Utes  aggressively pursued more trade, offering the most readily-available com- modity: slaves. The disapproving Saints then tried to stamp out the sale of  humans (although they encouraged the indenture of Indian children to  suitable Mormons). In 1851 and 1852, judicial and legislative actions ef- fectively cut off New Mexicans from the Utes, strangling the Ute market for  slaves.69 Each band then sought its own economic solution. The Northern  Utes—the Tumpanawach—hardened their stance toward interlopers. In  July 1853, near Utah Lake, a Mormon killed a Ute and wounded two oth- ers in an altercation over trade. This event sparked the Walker War (named  for Wakara) and sparked a series of Indian raids on whites that lasted until  May 1854.70 According to a recent study, Wakara’s “limited goals in the se- ries of raids he directed . . . were simply to obtain Mormon cattle to feed his  people and to force the Mormons into perpetually purchasing his Paiute  captives.”71 The Southern Utes (including the Weeminuche), meanwhile,  stayed peaceful. Schiel noted the very friendly Indians at their camp on the  Green River.72 He called them “a cheerful tribe. . . . A piece of bread with  </page> <page sequence="15"> Passing Through, 1776–1869 19 some bacon made them dance with delight.” The joy over food was under- standable, considering that, as he noted, they lived “in an absolutely sterile  country. There could be no thought of any subsistence by the hunt, for  one can travel for weeks without fi nding any game besides a pair of lonely  jackdaws [ravens], or a few contented lizards, which seem to represent the  animal life here. It is a country where, according to the statement of a fa- mous mountaineer, Kit Carson, ‘not a wolf could make a living.’”73 West of  the Wasatch Plateau, the Pahvant, San Pitch, and other Utes were also be- ing driven to hunger and desperation by Mormons who had taken up their  traditional hunting lands, killed game, and replaced camping sites with  farms.74 There, the legacy of mounting Ute displacement, coupled with  American hostility, broke upon the Gunnison Party. Just before Gunnison’s  arrival, in the fractious fall of 1853, a California-bound emigrant company  had refused food to hungry, ragged Utes and had tried to disarm them.  When one Ute struggled and wounded an American, the emigrants fi red  indiscriminately on the Indians, killing several, including Mareer, an old  chief. The emigrant train left immediately, fearing retaliation.75 The un- knowing Gunnison party was the next group of whites to come through the  area. On October 6, 1853, angry Utes, including Mareer’s son, killed Gun- nison and seven of his men in revenge.76 The expedition’s second-in-com- mand, Lieutenant Beckwith, completed the survey, but Gunnison’s death  prompted a rumor of Mormon involvement—helping to prevent annexa- tion of Deseret to the United States.  Meanwhile, only a week or two before Gunnison’s murder, back in  Missouri, John Fremont had belatedly launched his own attempt to map  Benton’s pet railroad route to the West. To illustrate his forthcoming re- port, he engaged the services of a young, Jewish artist and photographer,  Solomon Nunes Carvalho, whose reminiscences give the best view of this  expedition. They started out so late that, by the time they reached the  snowy lands by the Colorado River, they were killing their horses for food  and taking an oath against cannibalism. Struggling further west, before  crossing the Green, Carvalho noted “Capt. Gunnison’s wagon trail was still  plainly visible,” although they chose not to use it. The Utes in the vicinity  traded them grass seed, their only remaining food, and Carvalho (who had  already eaten his pony) parted with virtually everything but his daguerreo- type boxes in trade. He concluded that he owed his subsequent survival to  “the sustaining properties of this cereal.” Once across the Green, the city- bred Carvalho lagged behind with a badly frozen foot in a “desert waste  of eternal snow.” Prepared to die but revived by memories of his wife and  children, he painfully caught up with the group, who went on to complete  their journey.77 Later, back in Washington, Gunnison’s survey, despite the  political maneuvers of Beale and Fremont, offi cially put to rest Benton’s  unrealistic image of “a great central path to the Pacifi c.”78 Castle Valley  would not be the chosen corridor from the East Coast to India until the  </page> <page sequence="16"> 20 Castle Valley Corridor late twentieth century, with the completion of Interstate Highway 70, far  too late to pacify Benton.  Meanwhile, this parade of federal surveyors put the Saints on notice  that their protective isolation would soon end. Before the gentile jugger- naut arrived, Mormons had to hold by colonization as much of Deseret as  possible.79 Consequently, in 1851 Brigham Young sent out San Bernardi- no colonists, a group of families headed by twenty men including David  and Wellington Seely. Future Castle Valley colonizer Orange Seely, then  an eight-year-old, later remembered planting “Olive trees and grapes for  Ordinance purposes. I saw the town of San Bernardino surveyed and lots  drawn.” His family built the fi rst sawmill in the nearby mountains, and David Seely took over the colony’s leadership from Apostle Charles C.  Rich—all good examples of pioneering for future Castle Valley colonizers  Orange, Sarah, and Wink.80 While San Bernardino Saints built homes from planks cut by the newly- erected sawmill, another Mormon group headed toward what is now south- eastern Utah. Called to found one of fi ve Indian missions established be- tween 1854–1856, their selection signaled a change in LDS Indian policy  generated by the end of the Walker War. Forty-one male missionaries gath- ered in the spring of 1855, including John Lowry, Jr., whose family would  later have a major impact on Utah’s Indian relations and on Castle Valley.  In May, the party crossed the Wasatch Plateau, through Joe’s Valley and  down Cottonwood Canyon to the Castle Valley fl oor, following a Ute guide.  They found ancient Indian rock art and “stone coal” (Castle Valley’s future  wealth) near the mouth of Cottonwood Canyon; located sandstone pockets  over a hundred feet below their trail through the San Rafael Swell and pain- fully drew up water, quart by quart for their stock; crossed Gunnison’s trail,  and made their way as best they could along the “Spanish trail . . . [travel- ing] over a good country for a road without water,” a poor compliment  indeed.81 Building a stone fort, the Elk Mountain Mission, near the site  of present-day Moab, the missionaries enjoyed some initial successes until,  after fi ve months, several local Utes turned murderously on them, driving  the survivors back to the settlements. Thus ended this fi rst offi cial Mormon  foray across Castle Valley, doing nothing to expand Zion nor to improve  impressions of the area.82 While the Saints spread out, the federal government also intensifi ed its  attempt to control this distant territory with a host of new appointees in 1855. A new federal surveyor-general attempted to fi nalize land titles by U.S. law,  while the Saints feared dispossession. LDS bishops allocated Utah lands to  their followers by drawing lots for townsites and farming fi elds, holding wa- ters and forests in common under the direction of powerful church leaders.  While Mormons saw this process as benefi ting the Saints’s general welfare,  non-Mormons, shut out entirely, regarded this system as a monopolistic,  theocratic impediment to American free enterprise.83 As America pushed  </page> <page sequence="17"> Passing Through, 1776–1869 21 westward, this potential confl ict festered, unresolved by confl icting judicial  systems. Federal judges tried fruitlessly to establish their authority as church  members avoided their courts in favor of local, probate courts staffed en- tirely by Saints. A series of natural disasters in 1855–1856 helped prompt  the LDS Church to launch the Reformation, in which Saints consecrated all  worldly goods (especially land) to Brigham Young as trustee-in-trust. While  greater America recoiled at this new evidence of an un-American theocracy  loose in Utah, the Reformation’s other aspects—the view of Adam as a god,  rebaptism for all Saints, and a reaffi rmation of the holiness of polygamy— did nothing to calm their fears. As charismatic LDS Apostle Jedediah Grant  avidly preached blood atonement—the spilling of guilty blood to the point  of murder—fearful federal offi cials fl ed the territory.84 Concurrently, John C. Fremont, running for President in 1856 on the  Republican ticket (a brand new party) promised to stamp out the “dual rel- ics of barbarism, slavery and polygamy.” Slavery remained respectable, espe- cially in the South, a district particularly hostile to Mormon polygamists as  shown by the 1857 murder there of beloved Apostle Parley P. Pratt. He had  just married another plural wife (his twelfth) who had left her estranged  husband but had not divorced him. The aggrieved man killed Pratt, spawn- ing a Mormon outcry for blood atonement.85 Nationally, when Democrat  James Buchanan won the Presidency, he co-opted Fremont’s rhetoric  against the more politically acceptable target of polygamy and launched  the bloodless Utah War that sent federal troops into Utah in 1857–1858.86 The Saints completely abandoned their San Bernardino colony, a move- ment begun before the army’s approach.87 Under these tense conditions,  on September 11, 1857, Mormons led the massacre of approximately one  hundred California-bound travelers at the southern Utah grazing ground  called Mountain Meadows.88 Twenty years later, John D. Lee died by fi ring  squad as the scapegoat for this atrocity, while his son, George, joined the  outlaw element in Castle Valley, as later events would reveal. Meanwhile, the  well-disciplined U.S. Army took up residence in the Salt Lake area for the  next three years, bringing an end to the fervor of the Reformation.89 This series of events had a direct effect on a future Castle Valley leader.  As the San Bernardino colony broke up, most of the Seely family left in a  wagon train on December 24, 1857. They departed without Mary Pettit  Seely and her children, except for eldest son, David, who had chosen to  accompany his father, David, Sr., back to Utah. As son David later reported:  “She said that she had walked as far as she intended to walk when she came  to California, having come from Long Island, to Illinois, to Utah, and then  to California”—even farther than the Mormon Battalion.90 The return trip  was especially exciting for David’s cousins, children Orange, Sarah, Wink,  and their four other siblings. When the group camped near the site of  the Mountain Meadows Massacre, the boys found the remains of some of  the slaughtered. “The graves had been shallow, and the wild animals had  </page> <page sequence="18"> 22 Castle Valley Corridor dug up the bodies. One of the boys took a skeleton and thrust it into the  wagon opening, and terrifi ed the girls. Another boy found a gold watch.”91 The Seely train had a dangerously dry crossing, but their wagons rolled  into Pleasant Grove, Sanpete County, in April 1858.92 When they arrived  in Utah in the fading light of the Reformation, Brigham Young probably  counseled David, Sr., to enter polygamy, since Mormon commitment to  plural marriage had intensifi ed throughout the 1850s as objections to it  grew.93 At any rate, as son David reported, “father and Brigham Young had  a heated argument, and fi nally Brigham Young told David Seeley [Sr.] to  go back to California.”94 In later years, David, Sr.’s brother, Justus Welling- ton, who stayed in Utah, would, like Thomas Rhoades, also take plural  wives, forever committing him to a life in Mormon Zion.95 All the children  brought back from a California childhood would thus be on hand when  Castle Valley needed colonizers. The Reformation had also brought changes in Indian-white relations  through the consecration movement, in which the faithful dedicated all pos- sessions to Brigham Young as LDS Church trustee-in-trust. Sanpete County,  the Seelys’ new home, recorded 197 land deeds of consecration, includ- ing one from Ute chief Walker’s brother and successor, Aropeen (Arapeen,  Arapine) who had converted to Mormonism. Since the Utes did not recog- nize private property, Aropeen deeded all of his tribe’s holdings: the “por- tion of land and country known as Sanpete County together with all timber  and material on the same” as well as enumerated livestock, guns, and tools  to Young.96 The LDS Church also commanded that Justus Wellington Seely  and one of his brothers give the Utes their farm at Indianola, Sanpete Coun- ty, in exchange.97 Perhaps this mutual church involvement helped foster the  bond which grew between the Seelys and the Utes, which would become so  obvious when both groups later moved to (or through) Castle Valley.  Before anyone took further notice of the Castle Valley corridor, how- ever, the whole nation had to weather the Civil War. With the South out  of Congress in the short-lived Confederacy, the remnant U.S. Congress in  1862 passed three acts of tremendous signifi cance to the West: the Home- stead Act, the fi rst Pacifi c Railroad Bill (followed by another in 1864), and  the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act. The fi rst law allowed a claimant to obtain 160 acres for only the $10 fi ling fee, if he (or she, in the case of a widow) lived  on the land for fi ve years and made specifi ed improvements. The second  provided federal fi nding and generous land grants to corporations building  a transcontinental railroad. The last statute outlawed what it called bigamy  (including polygamy), disincorporated the LDS Church as an organization  that supported plural marriage, and limited the holdings of any charitable  organization (meaning, the LDS Church) to $50,000 in real property.98 However, the Morrill Act proved unenforceable because Mormons consis- tently fi lled both grand and petit juries in Utah. The government ignored  its defects, preoccupied with war.  </page> <page sequence="19"> Passing Through, 1776–1869 23 Fighting on eastern battlefi elds had drawn Union soldiers out of Utah,  where they had been garrisoned since 1858. All over the West, natives took  the opportunity of the departing blue-coats to attack interlopers on their  lands. President Lincoln, short of troops, fi rst asked the Mormons to guard  the mails before assigning antagonistic Colonel Patrick Edward Connor  and the California Volunteers to guard Utah. Connor established Camp  (later Fort) Douglas on the bench east of Salt Lake City and spent most of  his efforts killing Indians, including approximately 250 Shoshoni on Bear  River, and harrying Utes in the mountains just north of Castle Valley.99 After  1868, three years after the war ended, the Utes were increasingly confi ned  to reservations by federal troops, who now took the side of land-hungry  Saints. According to a recent study, “Inviting the army to take charge of  checking raids and pushing Indians onto reservations opened a new era for  Mormon expansion.”100 Spreading Mormon settlements had already destroyed Ute lands in San- pete County, and Utes retaliated by capturing Mormon stock, driving the  captured animals eastward into Castle Valley. Tensions exploded in April  1865 as Ute-speaking John Lowry, one of the former Elk Mountain mis- sionaries, got into a serious tussle with Black Hawk and with Jake Arapeen,  a son of the man who had consecrated the tribe’s lands to the LDS Church.  Within twenty-four hours, Black Hawk’s Utes were driving off Mormon cat- tle and killing all the herders they found, the beginning of the Black Hawk  War.101 Orange Seely took command of a Sanpete cavalry unit, pursuing the  Utes and their stolen stock into Castle Valley all the way to the Green River.  Finding no Indians there, they retraced their steps as far as Cottonwood  Creek, seriously short of provisions. Seely wrote, “We go[t] as far as [pres- ent-day] Castle Dale and . . . were soon met with provisions at the head of  Rock Canyon. After this it did not take long before I reach[ed] home tired  and happy to get back.102 The provisions that saved them came from mule  packers carrying some strong-smelling, homemade cheese. According to a  later local history, “The Indians were coming and when they smelled the  cheese they went away and did not dare to come near.”103 Cheese, of course, was not a permanent deterrent. Soldiers were. The  Black Hawk War dribbled to an end with a treaty in 1872, but Ute raid- ers continued driving livestock to New Mexican markets, this time from  Sanpete County rather than California, pursued by Mormons down the  Castle Valley corridor. Increasingly, the Utes were joined by Navajo, Paiute,  Apache, Hopi, Shoshoni, and white rustlers as the resistance grew from  Brown’s Hole, Wyoming, into Arizona and New Mexico. To counteract this  growing lawlessness, soldiers came back throughout the West. Some en- tered Castle Valley following the Old Spanish Trail westward from Colorado  to the Green River crossing (where the Seely party had abandoned pursuit),  then across the Castle Valley plains to the north, following the Price (then  called the White) River. As the men proceeded upstream, they discovered  </page> <page sequence="20"> 24 Castle Valley Corridor that the Price River Canyon was too steep to be a practicable pass. They  returned to the valley and retraced their steps eastward to the fi rst passable  canyon cutting north into the heights, now called Soldier Canyon—the fi - nal route of the Midland Trail. Somewhere in this vicinity, several of their  party died and were buried in an unmarked grave. The area is now called  Soldier Summit. The bodies have never been found.104 While the Civil War created the last major opportunity for Indian resis- tance, it more signifi cantly decided once and for all whether states or the  federal government would be supreme. The South, of course, preferred  state supremacy, as did the Mormons with Utah’s peculiar marriage prac- tices and theocratic government. But the North won. In the political cli- mate of the 1870s, when the full force of the national government sought  to control rebellious states, actions in Utah Territory gained the limelight.  Non-Mormons pushed for more rights and property. As a territory, Utah  remained (allegedly) entirely under federal legal control. Therefore, con- frontations could only increase until Utah could become one of the states  in the Union. It could never become a state, however, while its leaders em- braced theocracy and polygamy. This growing clash also played out on the personal level. For example,  non-Mormon Dr. J. King Robinson, taking advantage of Utah’s cloudy land  titles, tried to build a number of businesses in Salt Lake City. When Mor- mons disputed his claims to the mineral springs just north of Salt Lake  City, he hired attorney Robert N. Baskin—another non-Mormon arrival of  1865—to defend his claims. The stakes were high: if Robinson won his suit,  he would overturn most land titles in Utah.105 Baskin could do little to help  Robinson, however, when unidentifi ed hoodlums began intimidating the  doctor and wrecking his property. Called out one dark night allegedly to  see a patient, Robinson was shot and knifed to death, and his case died  with him. The murderers were never caught; Mormon lawlessness became  a national scandal, and Baskin, viewing the mutilated body of his dead cli- ent and friend, vowed to empower federal authorities to bring justice in  Utah.106 The Saints had just made a most dedicated enemy—at least until  the rise of riches in Castle Valley coal. A receptive Congress also reacted. As the Robinson murder and other  Utah violence gained national attention, Congress proposed the Wade Bill  of 1866 and the Cragin Bill of 1867 to limit severely the authority of the  LDS Church. Both bills failed.107 Infuriated, Baskin tried the local approach.  In 1869–1870 he helped organize Utah’s Liberal Party, which also attracted  General Patrick Edward Connor, an active participant in its convention. The  Liberals foundered on the rock of excommunicated Mormons who joined  the party but clung to their polygamous wives, a practice the Liberals op- posed. Nonetheless, they fi elded a slate of candidates, forcing devout Saints  to organize the People’s Party.108 LDS leaders had always insisted that more  than one political candidate contradicted the divinely inspired political </page> <page sequence="21"> Passing Through, 1776–1869 25 order. Righteous Saints exercised their freedom by unanimously sustain- ing their leaders’ decisions and by voting by acclamation for the proffered candidates. Or, as the Deseret News later put it, “One policy, one ticket, one  ballot for all. ‘Whatever is more or less than this cometh of evil.’”109 In  adopting a party system, the Saints slowly swung toward the American main- stream. By this time, the Mormons’ separate Zion faced a host of other new  pressures as well. Most important, in the post-war years two mighty railroads  swung toward Utah as hammers rang on steel across the Sierra Nevada and  on the cold, harsh plains of the Midwest. California’s Central Pacifi c (CP)  struggled eastward; the Union Pacifi c (UP) nosed westward, and the nation  waited expectantly for the fulfi llment of its Manifest Destiny. LDS leaders,  recognizing that geographic barriers were about to fall, in 1867 created the  School of the Prophets, a communal endeavor based on earlier models such  as the Law of Consecration and Stewardship of 1831 and the Mormon Ref- ormation of 1856–1857.110 The School began shaping economic policy by  directing Mormon involvement in the Union Pacifi c Railroad and fostering  cooperative industries to build farm machinery, wagons, and furniture,to  spin silk, weave wool, and to construct local branch railroads. Most impor- tant, in 1868 its leaders founded Zions Cooperative Mercantile Institution  (ZCMI) to handle wholesaling and to manage “foreign” imports.111 One  division developed strategies to preserve Mormon land claims. Another  touted ways to bring LDS converts to Zion to counteract the anticipated  wave of non-Mormon voters.112 In direct contrast to the Mormons’ threatened view of the transconti- nental, the rest of the nation celebrated its promise. As political jockeying  delayed the driving of the Golden Spike to unite the two lines, cities all over  America readied for celebration. Early in May 1869, telegraphers in New  York, Washington, Chicago, New Orleans, and a host of other cities waited  eagerly for news coming through the Western Union’s Omaha offi ce. The  nation, now wired in one huge electrical circuit, seemed to exhale with  one breath as a lone telegrapher at Promontory, Utah, tapped out, “Done.”  Fire alarms rang, church bells thundered, cannons boomed, and parades  formed spontaneously (the one in Chicago stretching seven miles long).  The event had all the joy and patriotism of a universally-favored war, with- out the fears of oncoming suffering, death, and destruction. Back in Utah,  Brigham Young did not attend the festivities.113 The Union Pacifi c continued maneuvering for economic advantage af- ter it entered Utah in 1869. In 1872, as the UP moved toward acquisition  of the Mormon-built Utah Central Railroad between Salt Lake City and the  transcontinental to the north, Brigham Young worked out an arrangement to  benefi t his church. The UP was allowed to buy up the Utah Central through  controlling its stock, leading to a railroad stranglehold on Salt Lake City and  a monopoly on the coal trade (so important for home heating and industry)  </page> <page sequence="22"> 26 Castle Valley Corridor Cowboys continued to round up wild horses on the San Rafael Swell for three quarters of a  century, seeking the herds among Castle Valley’s fantastic rock formations and rare watering  holes. Courtesy of Emery County Archives. from the UP mines in Wyoming. The UP soon acquired other Utah rail- roads, monopolizing access to growing hard rock mines but guaranteeing its Mormon partners a powerful advocate in Washington.114 Cementing the  relationship, John Sharp, who had represented Brigham Young at the Gold- en Spike ceremony and who had helped found local railroads, gained a posi- tion on the UP board in 1875, which he held to the end of this life.115 Meanwhile, as offi cials drove the Golden Spike home, Utah came un- der study by one of America’s greatest explorers, the one-armed Civil War  veteran John Wesley Powell. He led two exploration parties in 1869 and  1871 down previously uncharted waterways from Green River, Wyoming,  through the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, fl oating along Castle Valley’s  eastern fl ank. For once, viewed from the river, the area’s beauty triumphed  over its aridness: the “long narrow valley with mesas and buttes . . . [reach- ing to] a stupendous line of cliffs 2,000 or 3,000 feet high . . . of many  colors. . . . called the Book Cliffs.”116 He and his men left copious records  noting Ute camps, desolate canyons, azure mountains and occasional wild- life. Some of his fi ndings, published in 1879 as Report on the Lands of the Arid  Region of the United States, noted: “The largest body of arable land within the  drainage basin of the San Rafael is in Castle Valley, a long, narrow depres- sion lying between the eastern escarpment of the Wasatch Plateau and the  San Rafael Swell. . . . No permanent settlements have been made in the val- ley, but it is used as a winter herding ground for stock owned by the settlers  in other portions of Utah.”117 </page> <page sequence="23"> Passing Through, 1776–1869 27 By the time Powell’s report issued, some of its comments were out- of-date. Human impact had transformed Castle Valley in the eight-year  interim between Powell’s last exploration and his published report. Fed- eral surveyors had completed mapping most of the Castle Valley corridor;  Brigham Young had issued his last settlement call to populate it a week  before he died, and clusters of settlers had begun wresting homes from its  inhospitable lands. More signifi cantly for the future of this natural passage- way, the juggernaut of industry, embodied in a newly-chartered railroad,  was on its way. Reluctant partners of church and state, communitarian and  capitalistic, old and new, had begun their fi nal dance within this “last fron- tier.” </page> </plain_text>
