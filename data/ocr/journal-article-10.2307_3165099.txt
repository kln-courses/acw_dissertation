<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pierre Leroux: A Democratic Religion for a New World JACK BAKUNIN In the first part of the nineteenth century, Frenchmen had to adjust their world view to the ideological issues raised by the Revolution and to the economic problems that came with the development of industrial society. At issue was the extent to which traditional institutions could adjust to a rapidly changing world. At that time literate Frenchmen felt that they were living in an ideological crisis. Many asked themselves whether Christianity could survive and attempt to resolve the problems of the new world. Such a question had great relevance in an era during which the discussion of social and political issues was felt by most educated Europeans to have a religious foundation. Either the Roman Catholic Church would have to take renewed stock of itself and learn how to deal with the prob- lems of the new era, or a new religion would have to be constructed to resolve the early nineteenth-century ideological crisis.1 Many Catholic thinkers tried to meet this challenge. Robert Felicite de La- mennais, Pierre-Simon Ballanche, Philippe-Joseph Buchez and Alphonse de La- martine are only a few of the more well known Catholics who sought to have the church adjust its outlook to the needs of a postrevolutionary industrial world. Lamennais called on the church to cease defending the secular interests of its aristocratic allies, to ally itself with the rising democratic tide and in so doing to reassert its influence over the popular consciousness.2 Ballanche demanded in 1828 that the Christian ideal of equality pass from the religious to the civil sphere. He accused conservatives, who denied the existence of social progress and who were committed to social and political institutions inherited from the Middle Ages, of compromising Christianity.3 Buchez claimed that the Revolution had been the final consequence of a civilization that had flowed directly out of the Gospel. It was from Jesus that the Revolution had taken its ideals of equality and fraternity. Indeed, the Revolution had been a rebellion against the abandonment of Chris- tian egalitarianism by the Catholic church.4 Lamartine insisted on the contem- porary relevance of Christianity.

They believed they were living in an era comparable to that of the fall of pagan civilization and the rise of Christianity. A host of religious prophets announced themselves as the founders of the religion of the next epoch.7 Many social reformers felt that the only way to cope with the political and economic problems of the early nineteenth century was to organize a new religion. Henri de Saint-Simon in 1825 called for the formation of a "new Christianity" which would be devoted to "the speediest possible amelioration of the condition of the poorest class."8 After Saint-Simon's death in 1825 his follow- ers organized a new church to preach his gospel. In the wake of the July Revolu- tion the Saint-Simonians became a flourishing movement which helped popularize a radical program of social reform. During the two decades of the July monarchy the advocacy of a root and branch transformation of the economy was often tied to the call for the organization of a new religion to replace a Christianity that had outlived its usefulness. Etienne Cabet, Constantin Pecquer and Pierre Leroux were among the social reformers of this era who insisted on the irrelevance of Christianity to the modern world.9 It was Leroux, the former Saint-Simonian, who made socialism into a dem- ocratic creed, who argued most systematically that Christianity was outmoded and that humanity could not resolve the political and economic problems of the early nine- teenth century without organizing a new democratic religion.10 D. G. Charlton, in his study of secular religions in France, calls Leroux "perhaps the most widely revered social thinker of his day."'l Alexander Herzen and Guiseppe Mazzini both had occasion to refer to Leroux as the best mind in contemporary France.12 George Sand was his ardent disciple from 1838 to 1848, during which time she helped popularize his religious ideals in her novels.13 In a major contemporary account of socialist theorists, Leroux and Saint Augustine were called the two greatest theologians who had ever lived, and it was intimated that perhaps Leroux was the greater.14 Leroux edited a series of socialist journals from 1831 to 1848. 5.

Leroux was a prolific writer. His articles and books show an im- pressive grasp of philosophical and historical issues and were for that reason highly regarded by the literate public. Like other social reformers under the July monarchy who called for the re- placement of Christianity by a new religion, Leroux had the deepest regard for the contribution of the early Christian church to the growth of western civiliza- tion. It is only historical distance that today makes it seem paradoxical that around 1840 many persons who saw Christ as the precursor of modern democratic move- ments and who looked to the Gospels for lessons in egalitarianism did not believe Christianity would survive the nineteenth century. Leroux considered Jesus a great social reformer whose teaching had created a movement that placed the idea of human equality in the center of western man's spiritual inheritance. The early Christians, he maintained, had dreamed of an egalitarian world in which men would treat one another with brotherly love.15 The first Christians did not hold the su- perstitious beliefs that Leroux felt had later become part of Catholic doctrine in the Middle Ages. Their religious views were synthesis of the most advanced philosophical speculation of the pagan world.16 Nevertheless, Leroux insisted that mankind could neither return to a pristine Christianity nor develop out of the Christian faith a modern egalitarian creed.'7 He asserted that, unlike the liberal thinkers of the Enlightenment, he felt no hostility towards Christianity. Rather he considered it "the last form in which our West has lived spiritually, morally and socially." But Christianity was as irrelevant to the solution of contemporary Eu- ropean problems as were the scientific theories of the past or the republics of antiquity.18 Leroux believed that before European man could move on to create the new religious synthesis that alone could resolve the economic and political problems of the nineteenth century, he had to have an accurate grasp of the contribution of Christianity to western civilization. Like many Frenchmen, he was influenced by German thinking on the progressive character of religious thought. In the eigh- teenth century Gotthold Lessing had argued in The Education of Mankind that Christianity had been instrumental in the gradual religious education of western man. Lessing's work had been translated into French by the Saint-Simonian 15.

The concern is with how that view persuaded this prominent early nineteenth-century social and religious reformer that Christianity should be re- placed by a new democratic religion. 18.

Moreover, Leroux was deeply affected by a general early nineteenth-century interest exhibited by Europeans in oriental religion. Most orien- talists viewed religion as the central determining factor in any civilization. In 1830 many of those engaged in the study of oriental religion expected Christianity to be replaced by a more comprehensive creed which could be formulated through a study of the lost meaning of the myths of oriental and western religions. It was an accepted tenet among orientalists that Judaism and Christianity had developed out of material provided by Indian religion. Leroux gleaned most of his knowledge of oriental religion from a French translation of the first two volumes of the monu- mental work of Georges Frederic Creuzer. From Creuzer he derived the view that the religions successively adopted by different peoples were progressive forms of an eternal truth. In 1832 Leroux referred to a contemporary renaissance of oriental studies and insisted on the oriental roots of the Bible.19 Despite Leroux's appropriation of many of the religious ideas put into cir- culation by German thinkers such as Lessing and Creuzer, he shaped this material under the inspiration of his relationships with French liberals and republicans, with the Saint-Simonians and with eighteenth-century French liberal thought. It is here that we should look for the direct origin of Leroux's religious views. Le- roux approached religion with the heady optimism of an early nineteenth-century French faith in progress and in the possibility of rapidly curing all social ills. Under the Restoration monarchy Leroux joined the republican conspirators of the Carbonari. In 1824, several years after the abortive uprising of the French Carbonari was suppressed, he helped found the Globe, a liberal journal in whose pages religious controversies had a prominent place. Paul Franqois Dubois, the editor of the Globe, reflected the views of the liberal generation who gave the Globe a then unprecedented circulation of 10,000 when in 1818 he voiced the hope "that the old cry of religion should mix with the cry of liberty" and asserted that the more man "attaches himself to God, the more he feels the dignity of his being and the better he can defend it." In an article that Charles de Remusat, one of the editors, later referred to as "the Globe's declaration of principles", Theodore Jouffroy argued that Christianity had long outlived its usefulness to western man and that soon it would be replaced by a new religion which would teach the great moral, political and religious truths destined to govern the world in the coming era. Jouffroy's views were well received by the idealistic youth of the Restoration who although scornful of contemporary Catholicism felt a deep need for religious faith. As a socialist Leroux later cited Jouffroy's article as the point of departure for his religious faith.20 19.

Leroux, who had shared the Globe's zealous espousal of economic liberalism and who had hailed free trade as the key to bring- ing on an era of international cooperation, now expressed disillusionment with the July regime's unwillingness to take economic measures to aid the poor barricades fighters who had brought it into existence. Six months after the July revolution Leroux handed the Globe over to the Saint-Simonian socialists and joined their re- ligious crusade. In November 1831, again disillusioned, he left the Saint-Simonians out of dissatisfaction with their authoritarian program for the direction of all of man's activities by a theocratic hierarchy culminating in a new pope. Now he sought to combine the commitment to individual freedom expressed in the liberal- ism of the Globe with the equally important commitment to social reform that brought him into the Saint-Simonians.21 Leroux formulated his social religion under the influence of eighteenth- century liberal and republican ideas with which he had long been intimately familiar. In the Restoration Globe he wrote that a new civilization was arising in the nine- teenth century and patterning itself on the ideal of "infinite perfectibility" first expressed by Turgot a century earlier. He argued that the Revolution of 1789 had resulted from an explosion of philosophical ideas demanding an almost un- limited reform of humanity.22 Writing in 1833 as a socialist philosopher Leroux contended that the Enlightenment and the French Revolution reflected "immense unfulfilled desires" of modern man which could be realized only by a social trans- formation and the organization of a new egalitarian religion.23 A key to Leroux's religious outlook can be found in the hope he voiced in the preface to his most notable book that the thought of Rousseau might be reconciled with that of Vol- taire, that the demands of religious feeling not trespass on man's dignity as a ra- tional free creature.24 After he broke with the Saint-Simonians Leroux came to believe that modern European philosophy from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment had been un- consciously developing a new religious sensibility. The philosophes had been prevented by their hatred of Christianity from realizing that their reforming ef- forts must culminate in a new religion. Leroux wanted to initiate a general dis- cussion in the republican press of the religious doctrines that should take the place of Christianity and preside over the foundation of an egalitarian order. Through such a discussion he hoped Europeans could reach a religious con- sensus and democratically found a new religion.25 21.

" 61</page><page sequence="6">CHURCH HISTORY Although he argued that Christianity must be replaced by a new religion, Leroux's acceptance of the early nineteenth-century belief in the progressive nature of religious history convinced him that not only would the new religion be in- debted to Christianity, but many of its beliefs and practices would be ex-ten- sions and amplifications of those of Christianity, especially of the early Chris- tain church. He argued that Christianity had begun as an egalitarian creed ex- pressing the grievances of the poor against the rich and powerful of the earth. The Gospel of Saint Matthew, he contended, provides the best rendition of this aspect of Jesus' message. Matthew, a man of the people, paints Jesus as the fierce and menacing enemy of kings and priests and of the rich. He reserves endless curses and the fires of hell for the upper classes.26 Leroux tells us that Jesus' egalitarian message was not a personal inspira- tion of the founder of Christianity. Jesus received his religious and social doc- trines from the Essenes, one of the three Jewish sects.27 The Essenes helped ef- fect the transition from Judaism to Christianity. Their contribution, wrote Le- roux, had been ignored by both Jewish and Christian historians. The Jews could not appreciate the work of the Essenes because they were convinced that Moses had left a perfect legacy. The Christians failed to understand the origins of their own religion because their contempt for the Jews made it inconceivable to them that Christianity could stem from a Jewish sect.28 Jesus, claimed Leroux, had been raised in an Essene monastic community on the Dead Sea. He had learned his aversion for riches from living among the Es- senes, who held all their goods in common and assigned their leaders the task of distributing property on the basis of individual need. Other Essene attitudes also influenced Jesus and the first Christians. The Essenes had a distaste for married life, which they regarded as being stained with voluptuousness. Unconcerned with man's perishable body, which they viewed as only a prison, the Essenes be- lieved that the soul was immortal and would move on after death to heaven or hell depending upon how a man conducted himself in this life. Considering philo- sophical studies unnecessary for a virtuous life, they expressed themselves in parables.29 Leroux contended that Jesus had become contemptuous of the monastic isola- tion of Essenes. An Essene considered himself soiled if a Pharisee or a Sad- ducee even touched his garment. The Pharisees, Leroux tells us, were the educated upper classes and the priesthood of Israel; the Saducees were the common people. Jesus preached an Essene doctrine to the Pharisees and the Sadducees. His first disciples were mostly poor and ignorant Sadducees who could understand his parables only with great difficulty.30 The first Christians, Leroux believed, were less deeply mired in superstition than the Christians of recent centuries. Neither Jesus nor his immediate follow- ers looked upon him as a God or as the Son of God in the sense later under- 26. Leroux, De l'humanitg, 2:792-794. 27. Leroux, Dc l'Vgalite, pp. 175-177. Leroux gleaned his material on the Jews of this period from the contemporary accounts of Flavius Josephus, Pliny the Elder and l'hilo of Alexandria. Josephus was a Jewish priest in Jerusalem in the first eentury A.D. Philo of Alexandria, a Hellenized Jew of the same period, sought to reconcile the Torah and Platonic philosophy by allegorical interpretation of the Bible. Pliny the Elder, a Ro- man writer of the same era, put together huge works that are full of invaluable infor- mation for students of the period. 28. Ibid. 29.

None of the four evangelists made Jesus into a person of God. Although Jesus probably believed himself ordained by God to carry out a miraculous transformation of the world, he did not present himself as a God or as teaching a new doctrine. He referred to himself repeatedly as only fulfilling the legacy of Moses and the Jewish prophets.31 The evangelists viewed Jesus as a person ordained to carry out the palin- genesis, or the destruction and renewal of the world that the ancient astrological systems predicted was close at hand. The Jews had learned from their prophets to expect a Messiah to rally their people into a new kingdom. The most religious Jews believed that the political revolution returning the Jews to control over their homeland would be combined with a psychological revolution-a radical change in human nature, a renewal of love and of charity. The philosophies of Plato, Zeno, Socrates and Pythagorus led their most advanced followers to expect a transformation of the human spirit. Among the Jews the common peo- ple awaited the end of the world, the separation of the good and the wicked and the reign of God. Throughout the Roman Empire there was a widespread ex- pectation that soon the world would end by fire. Moreover, powerful threads of resurrectionist thought permeated Christianity until Saint Augustine.32 Leroux maintained that Jesus was an ecstatic who had come to believe him- self consecrated by God to preside over the coming palingenesis. In his opinion the Jewish prophets, the great religious teachers of the East, Pythagorus, Socrates, all of Jesus' Apostles, as well as almost all Christian Saints had been ecstatics. Under a state of ectasy men lose their sense of reality. As an ecstatic, Jesus had been able to inspire an enthusiasm among the people that allowed him to perform his miraculous cures. It was not surprising that the fervor of his followers per- suaded him that he was chosen by God to direct a transformation of the world. Leroux asked, "What great man didn't count a little too much on his star?" Jesus and his followers were subject to mutual self-deceptions as they constructed a new religion out of the building blocks then available to humanity. Leroux in- sisted that his view of Jesus did not deny the role of Providence in history and was not irreligious. He believed that God actively intervenes at every stage of human history using mortals as the instruments for the progressive amelioration of man's condition on earth.33 The evangelists differed in the picture they painted of Jesus. For Matthew, the Sadducee, Jesus was the hand of God-a maker of miracles who came to ef- fect a revolution conceived largely in physical and political terms. Matthew's Jesus struck down the rich and well born and ended popular misery; Jesus was the apostle of equality and fraternity, the greatest of revolutionaries. Mark's Gospel was shaped by the religious conceptions of the Essenes, and in keeping with Essene teachings Jesus takes on a more spiritual quality. Luke, the Pharisee and friend of Paul, saw Jesus as most especially occupied in effecting a transition from the Jewish to the Christian priesthood. John, the fourth evangelist, was a philosopher who knew Plato better than the Bible and the Jewish prophets. He had the most sophisticated view of Jesus. As the Christian Platonist he sought the essence of the man who taught mankind its unity and its obligations of charity, fraternity, 31. Leroux, De l'humanite, pp. 873-932. 32.

PIERRE LEROUX 63</page><page sequence="8">CHURCH HISTORY equality and mutual love. This essence, which John identified with the teachings of Jesus, had existed before manifesting itself in the life of the Saviour. It was the eternal creative principle of God. John combined the Platonic doctrine of the Logos with the Essene conception of the moral life and with the general expecta- tion in the Roman world of an earthly transformation. He too believed in the Second Coming of Jesus and in the end of the world. But he envisaged the dyna- mic of the coming transformation as an internal force within all men, the Logos or the Word, that manifested itself in all history.34 Leroux found in John's conception of the Word the idea of the immanence of God in all men, the basis for a reconciliation between religion and philosophy in the nineteenth century. John had erred in identifying Jesus too completely with the Word, but the evangelist was describing the divine element in Jesus rather than making Jesus divine. John saw the Word as a light that illuminated every man coming into the world. He mistakenly obscured Jesus' human traits; but he believed God immanent in a different manner in all men. With John's concep- tion Jesus could be accepted by philosophers as the representative of the Di- vinity to men of his epoch. Jesus would then become an historical person who should "be loved but not have incense burned before him" and who could be "ven- erated without being worshipped." Since all men were divine incarnations of dif- ferent characters, the limitations of Jesus and the errors that he like any other prophet committed could be recognized by religious men. Both religion and phi- losophy could recognize Jesus as a link in the chain of God's progressive revela- tion to humanity through the course of history. Because of the Christian adapta- tion of Plato's doctrine of the Logos, Christians for eighteen centuries had been able to teach humanity the relative truth that the ideal glimpsed by Plato had appeared on earth in the person of Jesus. Properly expanded, Jesus' doctrine could be accepted in the nineteenth century in the sense that all men "are sons of God and the Divine Ideal can become incarnate in all men."35 Philosophers in the nineteenth century would recognize the contribution of Christianity in paving the way for the development of scientific rationality and democratic values in the West. Leroux held that Christianity had prepared the West for the philosophy of Descartes, the discoveries of Galileo and Columbus and for the liberating revolutions of the eighteenth century. He wrote, But after Jesus the West no longer knew the anthropomorphism of God. The very mysteries of Christianity as they penetrated into the intellect clothed in symbols have radically destroyed for ever the adoration of man by man and consequently all forms of despotism.. . . Man, that is to say each man, no longer recognizes any superior but divine and human reason.36 It was not only the egalitarian message of the early Christians and their doc- trine of the Logos that men in the nineteenth century could learn from in study- ing the beginnings of Christianity. The early church had a democratic structure. Deacons, priests and bishops were chosen by assemblies of the clergy and the people. Christian doctrines were formulated and developed by a series of repre- sentative assemblies of the whole church from the Council of Nicaea in 325 to the Council of Constantinople in 869. Nicaea's three hundred bishops from all the imperial provinces "were a true Constituent Assembly, a true Convention that triumphant Christianity sent to represent it and make its laws." Behind 34.

The councils constituted a "general reunion of the people."37 Leroux believed that in its beginnings Christianity had been a faith con- sistent with man's dignity as an autonomous rational creature. Christianity's early characteristics as well as the transformation it had undergone after several cen- turies can be seen, argued Leroux, in the evolution of the sacrament of baptism. In the first centuries grown men and women had been baptized after undergoing several years of instruction as catechumens in the new religion. With original sin not an accepted Christian doctrine until the fifth century, the notion of baptism as a removal of the stain of original sin was absent from the primitive church. Baptism in the first centuries was the sign of the conversion to a doctrine rather than of spiritual purification. The catechumen was interrogated on his faith before being plunged into the baptismal bath. Baptism was not an absolution but a second birth. As the catechumen passed through the water he was regenerated by the spirit of God. Upon leaving the bath he underwent a ceremonial confirmation and then proceeded for the first time to the Eucharist.38 Penance, contended Leroux, was another admirable practice of the early church that became corrupted over the centuries. The Christians of the primi- tive church, occupied with their own self-purification, had confessed to one an- other. Only neophytes and persons who had abandoned the faith and wished to return to the church had to confess directly to a priest. Members of the Chris- tian community were autonomous responsible individuals who were not dependent upon the magical intervention of a priesthood claiming to serve as the inter- mediary man and God.39 Leroux affirmed, These first centuries were centuries of religious liberty when Christians con- sidered one another brothers and equals, and when it never occurred to any- one that a priest was a being belonging to a superior class and whose words had a special power of absolving.40 When Christianity became an established church under Constantine, penance and confession became rituals that could take place only under the authority of the priesthood. No longer did man confess freely before his equals. The church assumed the right to absolve all crimes, and it "embraced all men under a sort of general suspicion." Christians had to place themselves before a superior judge and be absolved in order to be considered innocent. Under such a system a Chris- tian could with justice tell the priest, "What right have you to interrogate me? Have I committed some crime?"41 The change from confession among equals to confession to a priest completely altered the nature of the rite. For the first Christians penance had been a long process of moral reform. Once a priest was empowered to act as a divine agent and declare an individual absolved, penance faded away. Leroux maintained, 37. Leroux, De I'origine democratique du christianisme, pp. 1, 9, 11-14, 28-34, 39-40, 66-67. 38.

God acting thus must not, like an ignorant doctor, fail to achieve a cure. It was therefore agreed that the curative action occurred instantly and completely as a product of the priest's words: I absolve you.42 Although theologically penance and contrition remained essential to absolu- tion, confession tended to overshadow repentance. Innumerable evils ensued. Men appeared to be innocent once they confessed. It seemed reasonable to believe that if the priest operated under divine authority, the magnitude of the crime he absolved was not a key factor. Individual responsibility could survive only with great dif- ficulty under such a practice. Confession also facilitated the rise of clerical tyr- anny. The Protestants later accused the papacy of creating the practice of con- fession to a priest in order to "enslave the faithful to the clergy."43 Leroux believed that a fundamental reason for the demise of democracy in the church was the barbarian invasions. The barbarians were crude warriors who could not be trusted to run the church democratically. They could not be con- verted to Christianity through a long intellectual education followed by baptism. Nor could they be expected to confess fraternally to one another. Infant baptism and private confession to a priest were the only rituals by which they could be assimilated into the Christian community. The barbarians had to be declared Christians without their understanding the new religion and then ruled by a sacerdotal class which subjected them to regular confession in order to keep their violence within some bounds.44 Until the barbarian inundation, wrote Leroux, the Christians had not focused their hopes for salvation on an afterlife separate from this earth. Instead they awaited the Messianic epoch, the Second Coming of Christ, in which the world would soon be transformed. Leroux insisted that all Christians of the first cen- turies had been expecting such an earthly transformation. Christianity had been born in a rebellion against the brutal internecine strife of the ancient world and had presented an ideal of human brotherhood to bind men in living communion after the existing society was destroyed by God. Leroux summarized the dream of the early Christians: "Destroy the regime of castes and constitute a society of equals."45 In the first centuries the monks without property came to symbolize this dream. Leroux admired sensitive, educated persons like Saint Basil who took up the monastic life in order to find a refuge from the decadence of the Roman world. Only in their monastic communities could they have the tranquility to construct a moral and religious life. Aiming at moral perfection Basil felt that an austere, solitary life, independent of public affairs, property, family and friends was a suit- able means of governing his passions and directing himself towards his goal. Un- like later theologians, he did not praise austerity in itself, and unlike many other monks he did not like to punish himself. Basil was an advocate of disciplined communal living and an opponent of the isolated existence pursued by many anchorites. He hoped that the happy and virtuous life of the monastic communi- ties would have a moral impact on the world outside. Like the majority of early 42. Ibid., p. 756. 43. Ibid., p. 757. 44.

Holding such a view the monks tried to resemble angels as much as possible. Leroux contended that with the triumph of the doctrine of original sin a century after Basil the monastic com- munities came to have a different atmosphere. No longer were the monks trying to achieve an angelic perfection in a communal life separate from the rest of society. They were in flight from a world they considered given over to the devil. Leroux stressed the difference between the two monasticisms: "For Saint Basil asceticism is an aspiration towards the state of being of a pure and virtuous angel rather than a terror of partaking of the nature of the evil angel by touch- ing the world which is his pasture."46 The fall of the Roman empire gave Christianity a new face, putting an end to the hopes of the Christians of the first centuries that the world would soon be reconstituted on a just basis. Saint Augustine, who was born in a tranquil em- pire under Constantine and who died when the barbarians were triumphant, marked the end of this Christian Messianism. Leroux outlined the basis of Saint Au- gustine's thought: Saint Augustine represented the fifth century becoming Christian along with all the suffering of that conversion; he represented philosophy, confounded by the evil that flooded the earth, renouncing the earth and placing all hope in heaven; he represented antiquity collapsing and seeking to have its most ad- vanced thought reborn in another form.47 Finding the Roman world falling to pieces, Augustine taught that all earthly concerns are contrary to the religious life unless they are directed to the service of God. He formulated the Christian doctrine of man as a helpless creature com- pletely dependent on God. In the Confessions Augustine went so far as to ask God for strength to love Him. Although Leroux recognized that Saint Paul had already outlined the doctrine of original sin, he claimed that Augustine, moved by the horrible conditions of the fifth century, gave that doctrine its precise formulation. Leroux expressed horror at Augustine's demonstration of "the evil in the child, the sin in the stammering child." Augustine, by sacrificing all his impressive talents and virtues to the service of God, had exercised a tremendous impact on Western man. He had been able to refute effectively for Europeans of subsequent centuries the notion that man could effectively pursue his ideals within the framework of family and society. A Manichean for nine years, all of his Chris- tian works had as their basis a Manichean sense of the evil character of the ma- terial world. Leroux found appalling Augustine's idea of a life single-mindedly directed to the service of God. He wrote with regard to the Confessions, It was not only his love for women that he bitterly censured, he went so far as to stigmatize the faithful love he had had over a fifteen year period for a woman: that love for a woman was evil; the care he gave to his studies, to art was evil; his admiration of Homer and of Virgil was evil; to take pleasure in the songs of poets, to be moved by acting in the theater was evil. Thus Racine, when he was moved by the same feelings, tearfully reproached himself for his tragedies as if they were a sin, and retired for twenty years from the theater as if it were an abode of Satan.48 Leroux argued that almost all clerical abuses in medieval times could be 46.

While Saint Augustine carried out the latter task, Saint Athanasius devoted himself to the former. Leroux believed that the divinity of Jesus was not an accepted Christian doctrine until the Council of Nicaea in the early fourth century decreed that Jesus was a person of God. He maintained that the church for the first three centuries had tended to view the founder of Christianity through Arian eyes as a human being performing a di- vine mission. During and after the Council of Nicaea Athanasius met vigorous church opposition to the doctrine he sponsored.49 Leroux argued that almost all clerical abuses in the Middle Ages could be traced to this change in the Christian view of Jesus. Once Jesus was transformed from an inspired prophet into a God he became "the only Lord that one reason- ably could obey, he and his visible Church, his Church proceeding from him and recognizing only him above it." With Jesus deified the church inevitably claimed overweening powers. The doctrine of Jesus as a person of God created an un- bridgeable gap between Jesus and the rest of mankind. With such a view of Jesus Christianity could not be considered the product of the social and intellectual en- deavors of humanity at a certain stage of its history. It was a creed bestowed by God on helpless creatures who passively accepted it. Leroux contended that such a view of the formation of religions was contrary to a democratic faith, which must allow a certain spontaneous creativity to humanity in its development, Demo- crats should recognize Jesus as a human product of mankind's historical evolu- tion. Like other men but to a much greater extent Jesus had within him a divine- ly placed aspiration to realize the destiny God had set for mankind. The belief that humanity made its own history under the inspiration of a divine aspiration incarnate in different degrees in all men could provide the ideological underpinning of republicanism. If humanity did not possess that characteristic, then it was reasonable to view men as clay to be molded by a theocratic hierarchy claiming to be carrying out the mission assigned to it by the founder of Christianity. If Jesus' relation to the rest of humanity were analagous to that of a king and his subjects, then all the theocratic abuses of Catholicism were unavoidable. What would a king be without ministers and without a government? What would Jesus Christ-person of God, eternal Word, unceasingly occupying him- self with humanity-be without a Church, without priests, without authority, and proceeding ineffectually? The Church as conceived by Gregory VII was the necessary consequence of the deification of Jesus.50 Leroux believed that the work of Augustine and Athanasius had helped crystallize Christianity into its final and fully developed form. In the fourth and fifth centuries the Christian social and religious outlook that ruled the western world for the twelve centuries from the fall of Rome to the Enlightenment came into being. This world view consisted of a Christian rejection of the natural world. Leroux outlined it succinctly as: "The earth, given over to evil, was con- sidered a place of trial, and as the vestibule to a heaven where the evil would be compensated for." He argued that the career of Christianity after the fifth cen- tury was an extended commentary on the Augustinian and Athanasian synthesis.

A priest, unlike the man in the world around him, had neither family, property, children nor heirs. He belonged to God alone. Christianity after the fifth cen- tury could no longer develop; it could never extricate itself from the doctrines that formed its mold.61 The sixteenth-century Protestant movement reflected the weaknesses of Chris- tianity. The Protestants hoped to return to a primitive Christianity shorn of theocratic abuses of power. They failed to recognize, however, that those abuses were products of Christian doctrines which they did not question and to which in some cases they gave new emphasis. Luther used the Augustinian notion of man as a creature who is helpless in effecting his salvation as an ideological weapon againt Catholic practices like indulgences. The Protestants had a naive view of the Gospels, believing the very text to be divine and expecting all men of good faith to read the same meaning into it. Leroux maintained that both the Old and the New Testament are poetic books, "full of miracles, full of errors; and that these errors do not in our view destroy their relative holiness." The divinity of Christ, the character of the Trinity and the nature of man were not clearly defined in Christian doctrines before the general councils. The decisions of the first four general councils are as integral a part of Christianity as the four Gos- pels. Leroux argued that the Protestant movement reflected lay society's repudia- tion of Christian asceticism and its desire to control its own religious affairs. This ambition, however, could be realized only in the nineteenth century when Eu- ropeans would organize a post-Christian religion.52 A religion like Christianity could not adapt to the modem world. Only a new religious creed devised in the nineteenth century would allow man to avert the human ravages of industrialism by putting into practice the egalitarian and liberal vision of the French Revolution. Although Leroux referred to Jesus as the greatest economist and to the Gospels as the source of true economic science, although he believed that all the major figures in the history of Christianity had opposed the capitalist spirit, he insisted that Christianity's otherworldly abandon- ment of society in devotion to God and in search of a heavenly salvation had warped Christian ideals of human brotherhood. Christianity had taught men "to consider this life as a valley of tears, with all creatures worthy of contempt, while God alone deserved our love." The Christian had only charity as a bond between himself and his fellow men. Christian charity, however, was disfigured by being a product of a religion that placed little value on human and earthly concerns in themselves. When Christian charity moved a man to serve his fellows, he acted out a sense of obligation to God. The Christian could feel pity, commiseration or compassion for fellow creatures who exist only to be objects of charity in the eyes of God. He could not feel friendship or love for other men."3 51.

Leroux taught that as a finite creature man cannot love God di- rectly, but only through His image implanted in all men. Men must joyfully em- brace their earthly condition in order to feel love for God both within themselves and in communion with their fellows. He gave this outline of the doctrine of hu- man solidarity: Love God in yourself and in others; which is the same thing as: love your- self through the God in others; or as: love others through the God in your- self. Do not separate God, yourself, and other creatures. God does not mani- fest Himself outside of the world, and your life is not separate from that of other creatures." Leroux's attitude towards Christianity and Christian history forms a con- sistent thread that is interwoven with his prescription for a new religion for nine- teenth-century man. He attacked Christian otherworldliness in order to call for a religion that bound men together to work for earth-bound ideals and presided over a reform of the European social structure. He underlined the humanity of Jesus, the democracy of the primitive church and the role of church councils in formulating Christian doctrine in order to persuade contemporary Europeans that religions are founded by men and that they too could organize a new democratic religion. That the early Christians held beliefs and engaged in rituals which did not offend man's rationality or his autonomy as a free creature was evidence that religion and superstition were not necessarily identical; that modern man need not surrender his freedom and dignity when he founded a new religion reflecting the needs of a democratic and an industrial world. Despite his rejection of Christianity, the ceremonies that Leroux suggested for his new religion were modifications of Christian rituals. For example, he made benedictions an integral part of the new religion. Modern man, who depends on science to control nature, would not participate in rituals blessing fountains, rivers, houses, pieces of farm land or various animals. Benedictions would be valuable, however, if they were limited in their use to relationships between people either in their personal lives or in civil and religious ceremonies. A son could bless his father for giving him a decent upbringing or a father could bestow his blessing on a worthy son. Benedictions were appropriate to give spiritual consecration to marriage, treaties, laws, celebrations, mourning and to entrance into a profession. Such benedictions had a real efficacy. A blessing was more than a wish; it in- volved a real grant of emotional strength to another person. Under the religion of the future benedictions would be employed to make possible "a transfusion of hope and courage from ourselves to those we hold dear."55 There would be no priests under the new religion to whom men would con- fess. But Leroux felt that the practice of mutual confession among equals could be of great value. It was natural for a man to want to reveal to his fellows both his positive and his negative feelings about himself. Confession would remain a means by which people could purge themselves of guilt. Leroux feared, however, that his ideal of man as an autonomous responsible creature would be threatened if individuals felt obliged to reveal all their innermost thoughts regularly to others, whether or not the recipient of their confidences was clothed with priestly au- thority. He wrote, 54. Leroux, Da l'humanit6, 1:207-212. 55. Pierre Loroux, " B6nEdiction," Encydlopdie noumelle, 2:562-564. 70</page><page sequence="15">PIERRE LEROUX Each instant our lives reveal to us our weakness and our imperfection. Every day, every hour, even for the most virtuous, the memory of some transgression assails us. Is there an absolute necessity for us to reveal to other men every- thing for which our conscience reproaches us? But what would become of our personality if we were thereby forced at every instant to destroy it by having other consciences penetrate our own? Do you say that by ourselves we are in- capable of finding the resources to overcome morally our offense? But that would be saying that we are obliged constantly to draw our strength from out- side sources.56 Leroux believed that it was possible in many cases to confess faults to oneself and to purge oneself privately. Confession was a personal duty when a man had wounded another's honor and could repair the damage only by announcing pub- licly his error. Although any person could benefit by disclosing his evil thoughts and actions to others, unless he were convicted of some crime, confession must re- main a voluntary and informal process if his freedom were to be preserved."7 Leroux felt that defendants in criminal proceedings could be persuaded to confess their crimes if they were convinced that the sentences imposed on them would be designed solely to rehabilitate them. Unless criminals received such treatment, the penal system would be totally ineffective. Leroux observed, Penal justice condemns a man to ten years on the galleys; at the end of ten years this man is legally absolved. The law says so and it is even admitted in principle that no one has the right to reproach this culprit, who has atoned for his crime: but we ask whether this man is truly absolved? Perhaps he is more guilty at the end of ten years on the galleys than on the day you condemned him. When his sentence was pronounced who took charge of him? who recorded his repentance during the trial? who followed him to prison? who took care equitably to moderate his sentence ?8 Leroux never weakened his insistence that a new religion be organized to replace a Christianity that could not meet the problems of the modern world. He not only believed Christian religious doctrines to be obsolete, but maintained that the church had irretrievably abandoned its religious mission by allying itself for the past several centuries with European monarchs and nobles and sharing their power and privileges. Nevertheless, he felt friendly toward men like Lamennais who sought a reformation of Christianity. Leroux wrote that between himself and Christian reformers like Lamennais there were no "immense differences." Lamen- nais erred in his belief that Christianity could be reformed and directed toward democratic social amelioration. When Lamennais published his Paroles d'un croyant, joining the party of radical reformers, Leroux predicted that he would be able to rally few to his ideals in a church whose members would view his doc- trines only as "a heresy and a utopia." But in publishing a "Marseillaise of Christianity" Lamennais had helped reveal the true sense of the cross-that Jesus was "the brother of all proletarians, of all the unfortunate."59 Leroux was no more successful in organizing a new religion to spearhead the replacement of capitalism by an egalitarian order than was Lamennais in con- verting Catholicism to a program of democratic reform. But both men had a wide impact on European republican thought and movements in the 1830s and the 56. Leroux, EncyclopEdie nouvelle, 3:755. 57. Ibid., pp. 755, 767. 58. Ibid., pp. 762-765. 59.

Like the Catholic social reformers who did not leave the church, they found their hopes dashed to pieces in the watershed of the upheavals of 1848. In the wake of 1848 revolutions the church for several decades strongly repudiated the notion of democratic social and political reform. The revolutions of 1848 also demonstrated that religious reformers like Leroux, Lamennais and the editors of the Catholic journal L'Ere Nouvelle were powerless to protect the lower classes from the brutal force at the disposal of the ruling powers. Leroux had preached a pacifist program of religious reform. His plans of social amelioration were part of a movement that the historian Gaston Isambert has called "socialism founded on the fraternity and the union of classes."60 After 1848 many socialists would have as their watchwords class struggle and violent revolution. It was just this even- tuality that men like Leroux sought to avoid by embracing the religious obliga- tion "to write for the slaves against their masters, for the weak against the strong, for those that suffer on earth against those who profit from existing inequality."61 60.
