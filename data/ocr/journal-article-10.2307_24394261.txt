<plain_text><page sequence="1">Polity and Ecology in Formative Period Coastal Oaxaca. Arthur A. Joyce, ed. Boulder: University Press of Colorado, 2013,392 pp., 22 black-and-white photographs. $75.00, cloth. The art of the edited volume is fraught with many perils from the volume's inception to its final publication, although the reader is only ever aware of the problems in the final product. Often, the final collection runs to one of two extremes: excessively repetitive, with each chapter recapitulating the basic premise of the volume and repeating what is being said in other chapters, or the opposite—too little connection between the chapters, with each chapter standing too much in theoretical or thematic isolation. Joyce's collection avoids both of these extremes and presents us with a masterful selection of interdisciplinary approaches to the human environments of Formative period coastal Oaxaca. The individual chapters support one another without either being repetitive or standing in isolation and, 1 would say, present us with the first volume that truly addresses the human ecology of Oaxaca. Joyce (Chapter 1) begins with a concise yet informative review of the preceding half century of archaeological work in the lower Rio Verde (very helpful to those not familiar with the region) and, in what has become a hallmark for Joyce which should be more widely emulated, a review of his own theoretical approach to the issues addressed in the volume. The following two chapters (Chapter 2, by Goman, Joyce, and Mueller, and Chapter 3, by Mueller, Joyce, Borejsza, and Goman) examine the changing physical environment in relation to human settlement patterns and agriculture from paleoecological and geomorphological perspectives, respectively. Chapter 4, by Barber, Joyce, Mayes, Aguilar, and Butler, begins the exploration of the social dimension of landscape change by detailing changing patterns in the negotiation of social relations as reflected in changing burial practices from the Late to Terminal Formative periods. Chapter 5, by Joyce, Levine, and Barber, examines how the construction of the acropolis at Rio Viejo (the principal site in the region during the Late/ Terminal Formative) played a role in place making—the materialization of power relations and corporate identity in the landscape—in the regional polity of the Terminal Formative lower Rio Verde. Chapter 6, by Barber, describes the development and maintenance of regional political structures, and the processes by which they were negotiated, throughout Journal of Anthropological Research, vol. 70, 2014</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 475 the regional settlement hierarchy of the Late Formative lower Rio Verde polity. Chapter 7, by Workinger, convincingly questions widely held assumptions about the primacy of Monte Alban and the Zapotec state in the socioeconomic and political development of the lower Rio Verde. Chapter 8, by Levine, continues this theme with a review of ceramic evidence for the influence of the Zapotec state in the development of the lower Rio Verde polity. Chapter 9, by Hepp and Joyce, analyzes the iconography of ceramic figurines and other anthropomorphic and zoomorphic ceramic artifacts for both their temporal and, more importantly, their social significance. Chapter 10, by Pool, concludes the volume by putting the development of social complexity in the lower Rio Verde in the broader context of Mid to Late Formative Mesoamerica. In his foreword to the volume, Zeitlin describes Polity and Ecology in Formative Period Coastal Oaxaca as a continuation of the tradition of wide-ranging interdisciplinary research first pioneered in Mesoamerica by Richard MacNeish in the early 1960s. Indeed, if the volume weren't so cohesive in its treatment of the themes of emerging social complexity and human ecology, its interdisciplinarity might seem eclectic. More importantly, Joyce et al. bring a fresh theoretical approach to the subject. While MacNeish's approach to human ecology might be described as processual-ecological, Joyce et al. add what can be described as a social-symbolic approach. They do not ignore the landscape as a physical entity, but to them it is more than an essentially static substrate upon which external prime-movers provoke top-down, elite-initiated human responses which may or may not in tum provoke environmental change. They also view the landscape as a dynamic system in which natural processes and human actions respond to one another and in which social groups negotiate the relations of power and economy in a landscape filled with social meaning. Polity and Ecology in Formative Period Coastal Oaxaca presents a multifaceted description of the emergence of a regional polity in a "peripheral" region, where even the landscape itself is in part the product of human activity. Although ultimately short-lived, the polity centered at Rio Viejo emerged as a result of local social and ecological processes rather than conquest by or even interaction with the Zapotec state and Monte Alban, and each chapter convincingly builds on this theme.
