MEIGHAN ABSTRACT Elaborate rock paintings from several rock shelters in the central part of Baja California are reported and described. The paintings are assigned to the Comondu[ culture on the basis of artifacts found in the shelters, one of which yielded a radiocarbon date of A.D. 1435 + 80. The paintings apparently served as hunting magic. The complexity of the rock art and the wealth of sites and paintings suggest a somewhat more advanced culture than reported by the Spanish. N MARCH and April, 1962, I accompanied an expedition to study and record a series of newly discovered rock shelters in the central part of Baja California. The shelters contain an extensive series of elaborate paintings, and this report summarizes the findings and attempts to place the paintings in a chronological and cul- tural framework. SITES The sites reported here are between 27 and 28? North in the exceedingly rugged topography of the interior mountains of central Baja Califor- nia. All of the sites are in narrow interior can- yons at the southern end of the Sierra de San Borjas (Figs. 1, 2). The nearest community of any size is Santa Rosalia, 95 km. to the south- east. The Gulf of California is 35 km. to the east, but the drainage in the site area is all toward the Pacific Coast, the closest point of which is at Laguna San Ignacio, some 100 km. to the south. Because of the topography, local informants say that it is easier to go to the Pacific shore than to the Gulf of California from the region of the sites. Travel time to the Pacific is said to be three to four days on foot. A total of nine sites was recorded, of which four were visited on the ground and recorded in detail, and the others were photographed from a helicopter. The sites are all large rock shelters measuring from 200 to over 600 ft. across the mouth. All are not true caves, although they are protected enough to contain perishable artifacts. One site has a spring and large palm trees inside the shelter; all others are along ledges from 200 to 500 ft. above the canyon floors. The four sites visited are all in sandstone conglomerate, which has weathered in hori- zontal ledges so that the cave floors are level or only slightly sloping. The sites recorded photographically from the air are not discussed here in detail, although all of them were seen to contain large paintings of the type recorded in the other sites discussed below. The four sites visited on the ground are briefly described as follows (artifacts are listed in Table 1): Gardner Cave. This, the largest and most impressive of the sites (Fig. 2) studied, was found by the Erle Stan- ley Gardner party on a helicopter exploration in early 1962 (Gardner 1962a, 1962b). The site is 150 ft. above a stream in a canyon with various local names, but known in this immediate region as Arroyo San Nicolas, after a village location not found on any map. Slightly above the area of the site, in the headwaters of this arroyo system, the name is Arroyo Salsipuedes; about 10 mi. (estimated) down the system, from the village of San Pablo, the canyon is called Arroyo San Pablo. This whole system is apparently in the headwaters of the Arroyo Pinami, a large drainage indicated on most maps. Diguet (1895) lists two sites in the vicinity of San Pablo, but they are in the wrong direction to be identified with this site, which is north of San Pablo rather than south. The site is 10 to 50 ft. wide and over 500 ft. long and contains over 136 painted figures (Table 2; Figs. 4-8, 11, 12, 14-17). While properly a rock shelter, the south- ern end has a weathered pocket a few feet high and 35 ft. deep with paintings on the roof; the term "cave" can therefore be applied to the site, which is really a large rock shelter with a small cave inside it (Fig. 2). Flechas Cave. This is across the arroyo from Gardner Cave, about 1500 ft. to the northwest, and visible from Gardner Cave at a slightly higher elevation. It is a large overhanging shelter (150 by 50 ft). A ledge of rock forms a cave that is 3 to 4 ft. high and about 35 ft. deep. Paintings are mostly at the mouth of the shelter, but some are inside on the roof of the shallow cave portion. A total of 74 painted figures was recorded (Table 3; Figs. 9, 13). Among the most prominent is a group of three human figures with arrows painted across their bodies. This was the only such occurrence seen and gives rise to the name of the site. Palmarito. This site, which is across from the village of San Francisco, was visited and named by Diguet and first published by him in 1895. It is a rock shelter (50 by 299 ft.) that is perched high on the cliff and may be reached by a path from the top. Diguet has published a drawing of the principal figures. We recorded a total of only nine major figures, but this is only a small part of those present (Table 4). Damage by weathering and a small amount of vandalism makes this site the poorest seen in terms of preservation of the paintings. The site is easily identifed, however, because of a life-size central drawing of a large cat (called a puma by Diguet), the only such drawing seen. Pajaro Negro. This site is named for its prominent bird paintings in black and consists of a shelter (40 by 300 ft.) on a ledge some 500 ft. above the Arroyo 372</page><page sequence="2">MEIGHAN] ROCK PAINTINGS IN BAJA CALIFORNIA 373 A ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~,~~~ f~ 41&amp; 4D ' ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~ W ~~ ~~ .. 4. ++. -~~A FioG 1. Canyons of the Sierra San Borja in which the painted caves of Baja California are found. Soledad, a narrow tributary of the Arroyo San Nicolas. It can be reached by following narrow ledges from Gardner Cave and doing some climbing. A total of 31 figures was recorded (Table 5; Fig. 10); some are weathered and eroded. All of these sites proved to have an insignifi- cant amount of midden deposit, averaging only a few inches of dry dust on small areas of the bedrock floor. Only in crevices between fallen rocks was there greater depth of material. In such narrow crevices (usually only a few inches wide) and in small pockets under fallen rocks were up to 24 in. of grass, twigs, dust, and pack- rat debris. A collection of objects comprising 139 catalog entries was recovered from such crevices and from the surfaces of the sites; with a few exceptions, everything was found in the largest shelter (Gardner Cave). The rocky talus slopes at the mouths of the sites had an abun- dance of chipping debris and coarse stone tools, but no diagnostic artifacts were found on the slopes. The physical situation of the sites is disappointing, since collections of this kind can offer little or no stratigraphic information, and the sites hold no promise for an excavation pro- gram. However, the limited collection obtained from Gardner Cave provided a fair cultural pic- ture of the inhabitants and yielded material for a radiocarbon date. ETHNOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND The aboriginal language of the central part of the Baja California peninsula has been identi- fied by Massey (1949: 274, 293-5) as Peninsular Yuman, and the immediate area of the sites is considered to belong to the language or dialect called Ignacieno. The latter term is derived from the Spanish mission of San Ignacio, founded in 1728. Mission Santa Gertrudis was founded to the north in 1751. The sites are about halfway between these missions, in territory assigned to Mission Santa Gertrudis (Aschmann 1959, Map 9). It is probable that the surviving Indians in the region were taken to Santa Gertrudis, which had a maximum population of 1730 Indians in 1762 (Aschmann: 147). The tribal name Cochimi has been applied to the inhabitants of this area. Although some-</page><page sequence="3">374 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY VOL. 31, No. 3, 1966 TABLE 1.

Most of the archaeological occupation of the painted rock shelters is prior in time to the historic Cochimi, although there is no reason to doubt that these Indians were the direct descendants of the people who made the cave paintings. The archaeological complex represented by the distinctive artifacts of the later cultures of the region (down to historic times) has been called the Comondu2 culture by Massey (1961a: 420; see Massey 1947 for general summary of Baja California archaeology). The painted caves are clearly a part of this culture, and the list of elements characteristic of Comondui culture must be broadened to include elaborate rock paintings as diagnostic elements of this occupation. The paintings, added to artifacts of some sophistication for hunting peoples, indi- cate a surprisingly rich and developed culture for this part of the world, which has long been</page><page sequence="4">MEIGHAN] ROCK PAINTINGS IN BAJA CALIFORNIA 375 TABLE 1.

Although numerous in the sites and on talus slopes, only a few specimens were collected. Most are very crude. Chipping debris is common, particularly on slopes in front of the sites. 3 One from Palmarito. 4 One from Pajaro Negro. Shalloxv bedrock mortars occur in two sites, but no pestles were found. 3 This pottery is similar to two sherds from a shell mound at Bahia de Los Angeles (Massey and Osborne 1961). Description: Fired in uncontrolled oxidizing atmosphere at relatively low temperatures. Exterior surfaces brown to black; core color black. No carbon streak. Crumbling fracture. Interiors scraped and fairly smoeth; exteriors rough and unsmoothed suggesting a bowl form. Tem- per is grass and a very small amount of angular quartz fragments (3-4 per sq. cm.). Sherd thickness, 5 to 9 mm. 6 Scapula saws are common in the West and occur in relatively late sites in California. 7 One from Flechas Cave. s One of these is notched at the tip for securing a stone point of small size. One point from the site fits this notch very well. 9 This is a compound hook made of a piece of palm wood tied with cordage to a cactus spine. 10 The segments of cane are cut at one or both ends. They vary from 2.9 to 25.5 cm. in length and .3 to 1.4 cm. in diameter. The smallest may be unornameinted cane beads; the largest parts of cane arrow shafts. A cut-cane fragment of size similar to the larger of these pieces was found in position bound to a hardwood foreshaft with sinew. No fragments show burning at the ends. 1 Designs on beads are painted with a pitchlike substance. 12 The basketry is in two pieces, one 6 x 2 cm., the other 4.5 x 8 cm. Both are probably from the same vessel which, although coarse, is very strong and could have been used as a water bottle or carrying basket. Description of manufacture: Coiled, one-rod founda- tion split by stitches. Split stitch, except for pattern which is simple noninterlocking stitch. Slant of stitch is up to the right. Ten warps and 12 wefts per 10 cm. Weft material looks like bark peeled from twigs. There is a diagonal pattern of unsplit stitches, two stitches wide, probably a different color originally. Four bits of yucca fiber cordage remain embedded in stitches (overhand knot in one) and probably represent a carrying cord of some kind. 13 Fourteen of these pieces are of palm frond with overhand or square knots. These tied strips were probably used for carrying bundles of firewood, basketry materials, and the like. considered a cul-de-sac containing only the most simple and primitive of men. The Spanish re- corders saw little in the Baja California Indians that seemed admirable and, even allowing for the prejudiced outlook of the Spanish priests, it is difficult to reconcile the contempt of the Spanish with the picture revealed by the archae- ology. Perhaps the contrast with the Indian civilizations of mainland Mexico served to en- hance the simplicity of the Comondu' hunting peoples. It is also apparent that the peak of Comondu[ development was reached hundreds of years before the Spanish arrival, so that the Cochimi missionized by the Spanish represented a watered-down and struggling survival group rather than the culture at its most successful and richest level. Whatever the explanation, it is clear that the native peoples of Baja Califor- nia must be seen as somewhat more complex and specialized than our former knowledge would indicate.</page><page sequence="5">376 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [VOL. 31, No. 3, 1966 TABLE 2.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND The painted caves of Baja California have been known to exist since the days of the Span- ish missionaries, but with one exception the sites have not been scientifically studied in any detail. The exception is the site of San Borjita (also published as San Borjitas, San Borgita, San Borgitas) about 120 km. south and east of the area considered in this report. San Borjita is dis- cussed and illustrated by Diguet (1895, 1899), Davis (1949), Jordan (1950), Dahlgren and Romero (1951), and Dahlgren de Jordan (1954). An early Spanish account referring specifi- cally to the area here described is that of Clavi- gero: But attending to the few traces of antiquity which had persisted there, it is easy to be persuaded that that vast peninsula was previously inhabited by people less barbarous than those met by the Spanish, because the Jesuits, in the last years that they were there, discovered in the mountains situated between 27 and 28 degrees of latitude various large caves hollowed in the living rock and in them pictures of decently dressed men and women, and different species of animals. These paint- ings, although crude, show the objects distinctly. The colors that served for them are clearly seen to have been made from mineral earths which are found in the region of the volcano of Las Virgenes. The missionaries most admired the fact that those colors should have remained permanent in the stone through many centuries without being damaged by either air or water. Not feeling those pictures and dress to belong to the savage and brutalized nations which inhabited California when the Spanish arrived there, they doubtless belong to another ancient nation, although we cannot say which it was. The Cali- fornians unanimously affirm that it was a nation of giants who came from the north. I do not pretend to know what credit I would give to this tradition, but certainly there can be no doubt that there formerly lived there some men of disproportionate height, as is deduced from various human bones exhumed by the mission- aries. Although the California Indians have been asked the meanings of the paintings, rays, and characters, they could not attain any satisfactory reason. The most that</page><page sequence="6">MEIGHAN ] ROCK PAINTINGS IN BAJA CALIFORNIA 377 I&amp;A. 7. j F : i g . . .. k z W ~~~~~~~~~A 4w,Or~~~~~~~- FIG. 2. Vicinity of Gardner Cave, a portion of which can be seen at upper right. has been found out is that [the paintings] are of their ancestors and that those of today are completely ignorant of the meaning [Clavigero 1852: 21, translation mine. As the Jesuits were expelled in 1768, this account pre- sumably refers to observations made in the 1760's, but not published until 1789, since Clavigero did not write his history of Baja California until some years after his return to Italy.] The earliest archaeological work was done by Diguet (1895, 1899), a French explorer who did an extensive study of the area of central Baja California and briefly mentions over 30 sites (some of these are pecked petroglyphs, and only about eight of the sites mentioned contain paint- ings of the kind reported here - the survey covered a much larger area than that treated in this report). Diguet's site descriptions are very sketchy, and it is not possible to identify them in relation to the present work except for one site (called Palmarito by Diguet). He does not give illustrations of the other sites discussed here, although he was in the area. Some may have been seen in addition to Palmarito, and it is likely that he was told about others but did not visit them. There is no reason to believe that the few sites shown on his generalized sketch map of the area are the same as those visited by the writer, with the exception of Pal- marito as noted. It is clear that there are dozens of sites of this kind in the gorges of this moun- tain range, and until more detailed maps are available it will not be possible to establish site locations from generalized sketch maps. Even the Mexican topographic map (Santa Rosalia quadrangle) is far too generalized to show site locations with any precision. It seems most unlikely that Diguet ever visited Gardner Cave, Flechas Cave, or Pajaro Negro, since his discussion and plates emphasize the sites of San Borjita and Palmarito, although Gardner Cave is much larger and contains al- most twice as many elaborate paintings. Had Diguet seen this great overhanging shelter with its rows of large painted figures, it is hard to be- lieve that he would have ignored it in his pub- lished descriptions. Except for the reconnaissance reported by Diguet, there are no published accounts of the archaeology in the immediate vicinity of the painted rock shelters. The nearest excavation is that published by Massey and Osborne (1961) on a collection made in 1887 from a rock shelter at Bahia de Los Angeles on the Gulf of Cali- fornia over 100 km. to the north. This is an important site for comparative purposes and yielded several specimens comparable to those of the painted shelters. AGE OF SITES AND PAINTINGS The general artifact assemblage contains noth- ing that indicates real antiquity; for example, there are no large points and no atlatls or pic- tures of them. On the contrary, the presence of arrow parts and small, finely chipped points is enough to demonstrate a relatively late occupa- 4 -* .-.- FIG. 3.

These were probably in- tended to be red and black figures, but for some reason the black color was never applied. tion in this marginal region. The spearthrower persisted in use in Baja California until recent times (Massey 1961b). At the late end of the time scale are three clues to intermittent use of the shelters in the protohistoric and historic periods. These are from Gardner Cave. (1) Four crosses painted in yellow (Fig. 17). Isolated from the rest of the paintings and done on a surface freshly revealed by a rock fall, the bright appearance of the crosses, their location, and the use of yellow paint (relatively uncommon in other figures) suggest that the crosses are later in time than the other paintings in the site. These Christian crosses, all in a group, must have been painted by a relatively recent visitor, either a mis- sionized Indian or perhaps even one of the Jesuit priests, since Clavigero states specifically that such painted caves were discovered by the Jesuits. (2) An iron knife-blade was found in one of the rock crevices (Fig. 19 d). Although shaped like a modern knife, the specimen shows the cutting edge to be the straight side rather than the curved edge. This is ob- viously post-Spanish but could date from the Mission period. Consag (in Aschmann 1959: 29) reported in 1951 that the Indians as far north as 300, well north of the sites here mentioned, had metal knives obtained by barter from the south. Hence the Indians of Gardner Cave clearly had iron objects some years prior to the entrance of the missionaries. (3) Nine small sherds of pottery, all from the same plain brown vessel, were found on the surface of Gard- ner Cave. Since this is on the southern limits of pottery distribution in Baja California, it was thought at first that the sherds might be derived from Spanish-period manufacture rather than aboriginal pottery. However, analysis of the pottery showed it to be tempered with grass; and it is therefore more likely of aboriginal origin, possibly an example of stimulus diffusion resulting from familiarity with pottery made farther north. In either case, the indicated age for pottery in this region is very late. Nothing of recent Mexican origin was found in any of the sites. The items mentioned above apparently represent casual visits to the shelters after the main occupation of the region had ended. They do not date the paintings and are not part of the cultural assemblage revealed by the rest of the artifacts. It is noteworthy that, with one exception (Palmarito), the sites visited showed no vandalism, pothunting, or marking of the paintings with initials. There must be remarkably little visiting of these sites even today by the rather sparse population of the region. To date the paintings, a careful search was made for pieces of painted wall that might have fallen away and been buried in debris contain- ing some organic specimens that could be dated by radiocarbon.

This row of human figures is superimposed over animal paint- ings, including that of a deer, which is barely visible in the picture. The human figures are bisected vertically and are half red, half black. Average height 2 m painted surface were found in and on the shel- ter deposits, but unfortunately the shallowness of the sites precluded any reliable stratigraphic association. The next best thing was to date the period of habitation. Through the courtesy of Gordon Fergusson of the radiocarbon laboratory at UCLA, the following sample was dated: UCLA 200-A. Wooden artifacts (one battered wood- en peg [Fig. 24], two cut and roughly pointed fragments of palm wood) from rock crevices in large rock shelter (Gardner Cave) in central Baja California (Latitude 27038' N, Longitude 112?58' W). The cave contains over 135 large painted figures of humans and animals, the human figures averaging 5 to 8 ft. in height and done in red, black, and white. The paintings are pre- Spanish and hence prior to about A.D. 1700. The sam- ple date may apply to the paintings since the date shows when the rock shelter was inhabited by man. However, the deposit is shallow and unstratified; and there have no doubt been intermittent visits by recent peoples. The artifacts are presumed to be associated with the period of the rock paintings, but this cannot be proved. Guess date for the paintings: 500 to 1000 years before the present, based on missionary accounts and cultural level revealed by the artifacts. Collected and submitted April, 1962, by C. Meighan. Age: 530+80 years. This single date places the occupation of Gardner Cave between A.D. 1352 and 1512. Such a date is in agreement with the general pattern of artifacts found and also agrees with the Spanish report of the 1760's (Clavigero's observation) that the Indians knew nothing of the paintings but attributed them to an earlier people. As indicated in the sample description, even though the date is valid for the occupation of the shelter, it does not supply a direct date for the paintings. On the assumption that the paint- ings were done at the same time the shelters were occupied (and there is no reason to think otherwise), I believe that the radiocarbon date is a true indicator of the age of the paintings. TrHE PAINTINGS Since publication of the paintings at the site of San Borjita, Baja California has been known to have rock paintings remarkable for their size and elaboration. The new caves considerably expand the knowledge of this aboriginal art by increasing the number of known sites and add- ing many previously unknown figures, as well as providing new insights into the use and meaning of the paintings. San Borjita, a large cavern with some 70 figures painted on the roof, has only two rather nondescript animal figures (Dahlgren and Ro- mero 1951). This scene of a large number of human figures, some transfixed with arrows, has been not too implausibly interpreted as a battle scene, although actual representation of conflict (one man shooting at another, for example) is not seen. However, northern sites reported here must find their primary significance in hunting magic, since these sites show dozens of well-done animal paintings along with human figures of a style identical to that at San Borjita. In the four caves visited, a total of 250 indi- vidual figures was recorded, predominantly of humans, deer, mountain sheep, rabbits, birds, and fish. Very few nonrepresentational draw- ings, such as geometric figures, are present. Since most of the figures are life-size or larger, this is a remarkable assemblage of rock paintings and FIG. 5.

Beyond the 250 paintings in these four caves, at least nine additional caves are known to contain paintings of the same sort, and these are in a strip of rugged mountains some 80 mi. in length. Some of the latter were found and photographed from helicopters. Others have been reported to me since. Diguet mentions some 30 sites, but not all of these have paintings. Some of Diguet's sites are quite small and may not represent the same culture or period as the 13 shelters known to have paintings of the same style. While the largest sites have probably been discovered, be- ing readily visible from a helicopter, it is likely that many more smaller shelters contain such paintings. From scattered pieces of information it appears that there may well be over 100 undescribed sites of this kind. Obviously, the activity of rock painting played an important role in the lives of the people in this mountain- ous area. The basic colors used in the paintings were black, white, and red, with yellow considerably less frequent. Black is presumably derived from charcoal. The other colors are, as Clavigero says, "mineral earths." Samples of unused pig- ments from the shelters indicate that the colors are derived from the following materials: white: solidified volcanic ash (looks like chalk in color and appearance). brick red: crushed lava of a variety which has powdery red material in the pores of the spongy rock. orange red: red ocher. purple: unidentified volcanic material from an outcrop a few miles away. yellow: yellow ocher (?); source not found. White was used mostly for outlines and could be used directly like a piece of chalk. The other colors must have been ground to a powder and mixed with some sort of binder before applica- tion to the walls. Several bedrock mortars found in the cave floors may have been used for grind- ing pigment, although none of those seen showed any traces of color (Fig. 3). No brushes or other devices for applying paint were found, and it is not known whether such objects were used or whether paint was applied directly with the hands. The latter possibility seems unlikely in view of the large size and rela- tively narrow lines on some of the figures. No handprints or dots made with fingertips were seen. In beginning a painting, an outline was first drawn, usually in white but sometimes in black. Several outline figures were found which had not been filled in with color. The practice of outlining first, particularly when the chalklike volcanic ash was used, no doubt had a great effect on the standardization of the figures as well as the accuracy of the animal representa- tions, since corrections could easily be made before the paint was applied. However, several outline drawings of rabbits show a sure hand with no indications of mistakes or corrections (Fig. 13). FiG. 6.

When both colors were used, figures with a vertical axis (mostly human but also including at least three fish and several birds) were bisected ver- tically, with one side painted solid black and the other solid red; the whole figure was usually outlined clearly in white.

These figures look like men wearing trousers and are doubtless the source of Clavigero's description (previously given) of "decently dressed men and women.") Figures with a horizontal axis (deer, moun- tain sheep, and rabbits; Figs. 7-12) are usually bisected horizontally with either black or red on top. Mountain sheep in two colors usually show both horns, one of which is black, the other red. Again, there are several minor varia- tions in the general pattern.

Although it is not visible in the picture, this deer is superimposed by a small human figure, the legs of which may be seen below the deer's midsection, and by a black eagle whose head projects above the deer's back. The eagle was painted last and is much fresher in appearance than the other figures. or imbedded in them. Nearly all the arrows are done in white or black; these range from reason- ably recognizable drawings showing a point at one end and feathers at the other to simple lines up to 6 ft. long. Usually there is one for each animal, and the arrow is shown projecting upward from the back. It seems likely that most of the animals were shown with arrows at one time, although they are not clearly evident in more than about 25% of the animal figures today. The arrows done in white are often a mere chalk line, inconspicuous at best on the light rock and prone to weathering because they were drawn with dry pigment rather than painted. Furthermore, arrows are usually indis- tinguishable in the many cases of superposition, since they are often completely obliterated by overpainting. It is significant that at least three of the un- finished outline figures of rabbits (two in white and one in black) show arrows embedded in the back. The arrows were in the same color and were made at the same time as the outline (Fig. 13). This shows that the arrow was an essential part of the picture and not an afterthought. It appears that the arrows were always done at the same time the animal was drawn and that the picture was not intended to be mere- ly an animal in nature but an animal struck by a hunter's arrow. However, the concept was not universal; even allowing for the disappear- ance or obliteration of many arrows, it looks as if some of the animals were never associated with arrows. The association of arrows with human figures is less common and differs in significant ways from the association of arrows with animals. Human figures associated with arrows are fairly numerous at San Borjita (eight examples are illustrated by Dahlgren and Romero 1951). Yet this is only about 10% of the figures at San Borjita, and the sites reported here show an even smaller frequency of such representation. In the present survey, only three human figures (of 102 recorded) are associated with arrows, and these are all life-size figures, solid red in color, and occur together in a small area of Flechas Cave. All of these are shown with black arrows across the body. Furthermore, human figures usually have multiple arrows (from three to ten in number), whereas the animals usually have only one arrow. It seems clear that, while the arrows were integral parts of many animal pictures, they were not integral parts of the human pictures, but were applied later to a limited number of figures. This does not seem to represent warfare between groups; witchcraft or black magic may be the most ' . ...... t . O . .? . . . ..d . ....

Life-sized rabbit (in black), Gardner Cave. plausible explanation for the few human figures showing arrows in association. As with the Paleolithic cave paintings ol Europe, it appears that the act of making the painting was more important than the finished product, since there is much superposition ir which one drawing is nearly obliterated by an- other, in spite of abundant unused wall space where the new paintings could go. Up to foui layers of paintings were observed; there are prob- ably more than this in some places, but the ear- liest paintings could not be discerned when an area had been painted over several times. The act of painting also included an element of hazard. The highest figures are 30 ft. or more above the shelter floor and in some cases are painted so far out on a projecting roof that the picture overlies a drop of several hundred feet to the valley floor. In some cases, the pictures are placed in what appear to be the most diffi- cult and dangerous places possible. That this was intentional is shown by the abundance of unused accessible wall space. About half of the paintings could have been done by an artist standing on the shelter floor; the other half required something for the artist to stand on. The support was simple in most cases, including large boulders that had fallen from the cave roof or perhaps piles of smaller rocks. For the highest figures, however, some sort of scaffolding or ladder would have been essential. No such support now remains, but in terms of available material about the only possi- ble solution was dragging one or more palm logs into the cave. One such log could be easily notched to make an adequate ladder, but the task of getting it up the cliffs would require much effort by several men. STYLE There is an interesting difference between representations of men and animals. Men are always stylized front views of figures with hands upraised, while the animals are naturalistic pro- files done with great attention to accurate rend- ering of the head and with less careful but still realistic drawings of the bodies (there is empha- sis on plumpness). The legs of the animals are simply done although generally correct in pro- portion and attitude, but the feet of deer and other animals are sometimes depicted more like human hands than hooves. While animal bodies are always shown in profile, the heads of horned animals (deer and mountain sheep) often show both the horns in a three-quarter or front view. Human figures are not depicted with facial or sexual features, and the principal embellish- ments are head ornaments, mostly three- pronged. The few bird figures are an exception to the general style for animals, since they are shown with wings spread in a stilted "coat of arms" style rather than in more naturalistic profile. The birds (Figs. 14, 15) seem to postdate the bulk of the paintings, however, and they may not be part of the main artistic tradition. Especially noteworthy is the occurrence of several fish in the paintings and one "whale" some 15 ft. long. The representation of fishes is not common in North American rock art, al- though other painted examples are known in Baja California (Diguet, 1895; John Knowles, .,e.O ., . . FIG. 12.

The decorated surfaces have been divided into faces for purposes of description and tabu. lation. In some cases, notably at Gardner Cave, these faces are separated from one another by 100 ft. or more of undecorated wall space; in other cases, they represent simply rock planes adjacent to or grading into one another. Place- ment of the paintings on the faces seems to have been rather random; no "scenes" are distinguish- able, although in some cases it appears that sev- eral figures were done all at the same time. Up to eight men in a row, for example, are so similar in size, colors, and rendering as to indi- cate that they were all done by the same artist or by a group of artists at the same time. Among the animals, rabbits in particular are often done |!t k - w ;e k-~~.~- ,W-W FIG. 14. Eagles in red, black, and white, Gardner Cave. At right is one of the rare geometric elements (in yellow).

Animals are shown with arrows transfixing them, but no man is shown shooting an arrow. There is no scene that can be interpreted in action terms, such as "running," "chasing," "hunting," or "dancing." Nearly all animals are drawn life-size or slightly larger. Human figures are more variable in size, ranging from a few inches to over 10 ft. in height. The smaller figures appear to be late in time and seldom show superposition by other figures. The main period of painting character- istically sought life-size or larger human figures. The small ones (less than a foot in height) prob- ably represent a decline in the importance of TABLE 6.

The style is representational (less than 2% of figures are geometric or nonrepresentational; Fig. 16) and differs from much of North Ameri- can petroglyphic art, which tends toward geo- metric, nonrepresentational figures. The paint- ings include arrows, but there are no pictures of other man-made devices, such as bows or spear- throwers. There are no plants. Notable is the virtual absence of snakes and lizards, common in rock paintings and carvings of the West. No such figures were seen in the caves here re- ported, although Pepper (1964) illustrates a new site with elaborate serpent figure(s). PURPOSE OF THE PAINTINGS Several lines of reasoning support the conclu- sion that the paintings had a cultural meaning connected in some way with hunting magic. The emphasis on realistic, life-sized animals, often associated with arrows, is not unique to Baja California, but here it is a major feature of the paintings rather than a casual occurrence. The superposition of one painting over another, plus the effort to put paintings in high and hazardous places, suggests that the finished painting was not as important as the act of making the paint- ing. The general absence of purely decorative devices also indicates that aesthetic satisfaction was secondary to "standardized realism" in the mind of the artist. In all these features the Baja California paintings are comparable to the Upper Paleolithic cave paintings of Europe. Unlike the European paintings, those of Baja California include a large proportion of stylized human figures. These are represented in differ- FIG. 15. Eagles in black, Gardner Cave. These are superimposed on human and animal figures and are much fresher in appearance than those they cover. ent colors and many have simple headdresses, but, in contrast to the animal figures, there is no indication that the humans represent particular individuals or groups. At two places one can FIG. 16.

Four yellow crosses, Gardner Cave. These are isolated from other paintings and probably repre- sent a later period. Height of a, 45 cm. see from the canyon floor an imposing row of faceless, anonymous men with hands upraised. Only later does one become aware that these human figures are associated with, and often superimposed upon, paintings of animals. I be- lieve that this anonymous style and the evidence of superposition support the conjecture that the human figures represent the dominance of man over the animals and that their meaning, like the occurrence of arrows imbedded in the ani- mals, lies in the realm of creating or controlling by magic the animal life necessary to the exist- ence of the hunter. A record of 55 superpositions (Table 6) shows that men are painted over animal figures 20 times while the reverse occurs only ten times. Since there are more animal than human figures, a chance arrangement of superposition would result in 31 cases of animal superposition over humans, three times as many as observed. Fur- thermore, the ten observed cases are misleading because several are part of multiple layers of painting where animals superimposed on men have still other human figures on top of both. Finally, in field recording, even trivial super- positions (such as the tip of a foot over a large figure) were noted and counted the same as other superpositions of a full figure over another figure. The original recording of superpositions was done for purposes of studying the sequence of paintings rather than their meaning, and as a result the available data are not clear enough to justify statistical analysis. It is noteworthy, however, that the superposition of human over animal figures is at least three and possibly as much as five or six times more prevalent than would be expected by chance. This does not mean that animals are never present in the uppermost painting, but it does suggest that the artist believed that human figures should be painted along with the animals and that men were dominant over the animals. We cannot know whether the idea was an overt part of the painting tradition or whether it was an un- conscious wish-fulfillment in the minds of the painters.

Straight side of knife blade is the cutting edge. paintings are not patterned clearly enough to indicate a verbalized set of rules taught to each generation, yet there is enough patterning to indicate that psychological, if not cultural, fac- tors were at work. Levine offers some trial interpretations of Upper Paleolithic art, almost all of which can be applied to the Baja California cave paintings and some with even more force than they hold for the European paintings. For example, he says that "The anthropomorphic figures, as a general class of art, express the affiliation be- tween men and other living creatures and, as well, the personification of nature" (Levine 1957: 961). In the Baja California caves, the observations given above suggest a similar notion which I would verbalize as "the spirit of man dominant over the creatures of nature." This may have been overt in the culture of the paint- ers, that is, stated by the elders, or it may have been covert - an idea not verbalized or taught. Levine also discusses perspective tordue or twisted nersnective- the nractice of renresenting the horns of animals otherwise drawn in profile as turned around full face to the viewer. This has been mentioned above as common for the Baja California horned animals (deer and mountain sheep). Levine believes that this styl- istic feature is a reflection of the hunter-artist's preoccupation with the horns of the animal - the dangerous part, so far as a hunter with feeble weapons is concerned. This argument is convincing and could well apply to the Baja California paintings. However, in the latter there are numerous instances of twisted per- spective in representations of rabbits, the two nondangerous ears of which are nearly always shown in profile drawings. The ears of deer are likewise shown in several instances. This type of portrayal could arise from two sources. First, in viewing an animal in nature one seldom sees it in true profile; if one can see a rabbit at all, he can usually see both ears even though all the legs may not be visible. Hence the representa- tion of both ears or both horns may be simply an attempt at realism. Secondly, as noted above, the painters of the Baja California animals ap- pear to have given more attention to the heads of animals, drawing these more carefully and with more detail than the bodies or legs. Paint- ings may have been started by drawing all the head features first. To be sure, this interest in the head and its features provides some support for Levine's suggestion. COMPARISONS WITH NORTH AMERICAN ROCK PAINTINGS The Baja California paintings seem to be unique in North America, and I have found nothing closely comparable.

Cut sections from ribs of palm fronds, Gardner Cave. Bend area of Texas. However, the recent de- tailed study of many of these paintings by Geb- hard (1960) shows that the differences are far more striking than the similarities. The Texas paintings show numerous spearthrowers and depict men holding spearthrowers and bows. The Texas caves usually have more human figures than animals. Gebhard's recent survey of the sites in the Diablo region lists numerous representations of snakes but only one rabbit painting. In all these features of content, the Texas sites differ from those reported here, and in addition there are many features of style which show the Baja California cave painting to be an independent development. A complete comparative analysis is not attempted here, al- though Gebhard's study, one of the few which provides an actual count of the different ele- ments in the various sites, permits comparison of many points of content and style. For the rest of North America, most other areas in which paintings are found are seen immediately to be quite different from the Baja California cave paintings because of the latters' concentration on human and animal figures 5 CM. FIG. 22. Drawing of cut cane beads shown in Fig. 23e. The three beads are decorated with encircling lines. rather than on the geometric elements so com- mon in other North American sites. A pre- ponderance of large drawings, with men and animals done life-size, also appears to be quite rare and, in the way done in Baja California, unique. Because of the geographic isolation of Baja California, it would be remarkable if there was evidence of any real diffusion of artistic tradi- tions in pre-Columbian times. The persistence of spearthrowers on the peninsula, the absence of pottery in much of the area, and the general- ized hunting and gathering cultures throughout are among many indicators of a relict area iso- lated culturally as well as geographically. Al- most the only feasible source of influence would be southern California, where elaborate rock paintings are found in the Chumash area around Santa Barbara. These, however, are almost completely unlike the Baja California rock paintings. SEQUENCE OF PAINTING STYLES AND ELEMENTS In surveying the caves here reported, records were made of superpositions of figures (Table 6) and colors (Table 7), and a careful search was conducted to see if sequent periods of paint- ing could be determined. In general, this was not productive, and the basic aspects of style and H~~~~~~~~ 0. ... ...... FIG. 23.

This in turn suggests a relatively short period of time during which the art flourished - a few genera- tions or at most two centuries. T'he only -exceptions to this generalization seem to lie in the paintings of birds ("eagles") and the very small human figures (6 to 12 in. in height, usually solid red in color but otherwise similar in form and attitude to the larger human figures). It appears that the birds and little human figures fall at the end of the painting tradition when the paintings no longer retained their earlier strong connotations of hunting magic. This looks very much like a "decline" or 'cultural disruption,' possible reasons for which are offered in the conclusion. ARTIFACTS The objects recovered from the painted rock shelters are summarized in Table 1 and accom- panying notes. The more diagnostic specimens are shown in the accompanying illustrations. Unmodified marine shells are identified in Table 8. The artifacts are in the Mexican National Museum. The collection has two principal values for the present study. The first is chronological. Wooden items have provided a radiocarbon date, and the collection as a whole also permits some estimate of the time depth of the occupation. Secondly, the collection is relevant for the cultural context of the paintings, since it shows the general culture of the people who presumably made the paintings. Although the collection is very limited in size and scope, it represents just about all the excavation possible in the caves visited. Despite these limitations, this collection will have to serve for tentative conclusions, some of which will no doubt be altered in the future when a larger artifact sample can be recovered. The chronological evidence of the radiocarbon date, indicating an age of a few hundred years for the occupa- tion of the sites, has been previously discussed. The date is consistent with the archaeological culture, since all of the artifacts found appear to belong to the Comondu assemblage, which is of historic and late prehistoric age. Characteristic artifacts in the collection described here, which are also present in the protohistoric-historic sites reported by Massey and Osborne (1961) at Bahia de Los Angeles, include rare sherds of plain pottery with fiber temper, bone awls of standard form, tubular stone pipes, compound arrow parts with wooden tips (sharpened foreshafts), bundles of straightened cactus spines (viz- naga) bound with cordage, common 2-ply, Z-twist cord- age, square-knot netting, and a possible bull-roarer frag- ment. In addition to these similarities, quite numerous in view of the small collections being compared, the present collection contains other items identified as of Comondiu affiliation (Massey 1961a: 420). These include coiled basketry, compound pitahaya hook for collecting cactus fruits, and wooden arrow foreshaft notched for a small stone point. Since there is nothing that indicates an older cultural stratum or a previous occupation of the sites, the conclusion must be that the cave art falls within the past several hundred years and is part of the Comondu' culture. 5~~~~~ FIG. 25.

CONCLUSION From the evidence available, a brief historical reconstruction may be attempted. At an un- known time, certainly more than several hun- dred years ago, the Peninsular Yumans occu- pied the northern half of Baja California, where they pursued their life way of hunting and gathering with considerable success. At least initially, this cultural group was by no means as tenuous and impoverished as much of the Western Desert culture appears to have been. * . ...... .. . | .~ . .... ..: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.. . . . .... .. ... :. . ... 1 .. .. .... .....

However, as time passed, the living got harder for reasons we cannot yet discern. Perhaps the general desiccation of the Desert West had its effects on the game; perhaps overhunting had depleted the resources; perhaps other causes also played a part. Whatever the initial stimulus, an increas- ing amount of cultural effort went into improving the game supply through the sorcery of rock paintings. Beginning perhaps 600 years ago, this cultural effort produced in a few generations hundreds and probably thousands of large paintings, dominated by arrow- impaled game animals and anonymous human figures that were frequently superimposed. Alas, the magic did not prevail; the game disappeared, and the paintings were abandoned some two hundred years before the Spanish entered the region. By the time of the Spanish missionization, the population was probably smaller and the culture poorer than it had been for hundreds of years, although the surviving Indians continued the tech- nological and cultural traditions of their ancestors. An alternative explanation for the decline of rock painting may lie in the disruption of Indian culture from disease epidemics. Baja California was visited by Ulloa in 1539, Cabrillo in 1542 (several locations on west coast), and Vizcaino in 1602. It is well known that European diseases spread much faster than the Europeans them- selves and that many Indian populations were decimated by disease long before the first Euro- pean explorer or missionary reached them. This probability is specifically noted for Baja Cali- fornia by Aschmann (1959: 29). A radiocatbon date of A.D. 1432 for one of the rock-painting sites suggests that the final collapse of the cave- painting tradition was rather close to the first possible exposure of the Indians to the Spanish. While this area was not missionized until the 1700's, prior introduction of European diseases could well have taken a heavy toll and severely disrupted the Indian culture by this time. This is of course a wholly unprovable speculation at</page><page sequence="20">MEIGHAN] ROCK PAINTINGS IN BAJA CALIFORNIA 391 TABLE 8.

The newly studied painted caves are impor- tant because they show the existence of a rela- tively specialized hunting people over several hundred square miles of a little-known corner of the world. San Borjita, the first of the painted caves to be described, has been appreciated for its elaborate paintings but has been largely re- garded as an isolated instance rather than a feature common to many people over a wide area. Although Diguet's pioneering work men- tions several sites of this type, his observations have not been appreciated because of inade- quate publication of the paintings. The present study confirms and amplifies previous work by documenting the fact that there is not one large cave of specialized "ceremonial" nature, but many large rock shelters bearing paintings in the same style and occurring through at least 100 miles of mountain range. It is clear that this art represents a tribal group that occupied sev- eral hundred square miles and possessed an elaborate art and ritual pattern which was a fundamental part of everyday life. Acknowledgments. It is a pleasure to express my gratitude to Erle Stanley Gardner, who discovered the caves reported here and who organized and financed the expedition which made the present study possible. Others of the Gardner party were particularly helpful in gathering the data for this study, and special mention must be made of Sam Hicks, who helped me compile a sketch map of the complex drainage system. Gardner has published two popular accounts of the project re- ported here (Gardner 1962a, 1962b). The photographs accompanying his articles are the first published record of the sites he describes, which are further analyzed in this report. Our government permit for the exploration of the sites was obtained through the good offices of Roman Pifia Chan, Department of Prehispanic Monuments, Na- tional Institute of Anthropology and History, Mexico City. The unfailing cooperation and support of the Re- public of Mexico is here gratefully acknowledged. My colleagues have also been helpful in many ways. I am indebted to Gordon Fergusson for assistance in obtaining the radiocarbon date, to Joseph Murdoch for identification of pigment samples, and to LouElla R. Saul for identification of unmodified marine shells. Fin- ally, H. B. Nicholson, my co-worker in several ventures in Mexican archaeology, was kind enough to carry the entire collection with him to Mexico and deliver it in person to the proper authorities. FIG. 27.
