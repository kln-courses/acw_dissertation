<plain_text><page sequence="1">Accounting for Evil - Justification or Explanation? A Response to Eliot Deutsch Gwen Griffith-Dickson Director, Lokahi Foundation, and Visiting Professor, Kings' College, University of London I am both grateful and gratified that Professor Deutsch has taken the time not only to read what was intended as an undergraduate teaching text, but also to comment on it with characteristic thoughtful ness and perspicacity. Deutsch has put his finger unerringly on a muddled point in contemporary dis- cussions of the problem of evil. As in everyday discourse, there is potential ambigu- ity about the seemingly innocuous English word 'understand/ which in colloquial speech is equivocal, indicating either cognitive mastery or an empathy verging on implicit agreement or consent: It's all right, I understand/ Intending the one pro- vokes reactions directed at the other; comprehending the significance of evil and suffering in our existence is treated as if it somehow 'justifies' evil states of affairs. For example, Mesle has written that if good comes from evil, that means evil is really good, and to say, as many religious people do, that all things ultimately work toward the good is to say that nothing is really evil.1 More subtly, a commentator such as Terence Tilley can argue that the act of theodicy, understood as 'justifying evil,' is in fact evil itself.2 Deutsch is unusual in teasing apart these senses in his neatly framed dichotomy: evil needs to be understood, but it cannot be justified. Let me immediately and briefly answer Deutsch's question on my own view about 'understanding' and 'justifying' evil. Any evil act can be understood - yes, any, if we have the courage, the wisdom, and the empathetic imagination - even the most unspeakable atrocity. But none of it, perhaps, is or ever should be justifi- able. Not even the smallest act of petty spite. Contemporary writing on the problem of evil in Western philosophy of religion is full of good impulses; but it is like walking on a narrow mountain trail: one slip and you've overbalanced in a way that can take everything down with you. Here is my attempt to clarify some of the issues that form the foundation for Deutsch's ques- tion and our shared response. We also share a commitment to seeing the contribu- tions of Eastern philosophy recognized and taken up in Western seminar rooms, to the profit of reflection on the issues themselves. Some suffering or 'evil' is not evil in an absolute sense, as signifying moral viciousness. It causes real distress, but is bound up in the nature of things, a universe 578 Philosophy East &amp; West Volume 58, Number 4 October 2008 578-582 Â© 2008 by University of Hawai'i Press</page><page sequence="2">in which it is not possible for every desire of every individual to be granted, not least because our respective needs and desires conflict with others'. In that sense, it can be important to acknowledge that not all that we bemoan - or which in a polemical context can be taken as a 'disproof of the existence of God, for example - is morally evil and incompatible with the reality of religious beliefs. This is something that Western students can learn from Indian reflections on maya, for example, and the role played by our perception. Nevertheless there is (I submit) 'evil' found in human action that is not reducible to purely subjective stances. In no way is genocide or any other atrocity merely a matter of personal taste and perspective. It is no contradiction that in the relevant Indian systems, belief in the subjectivity of perceptions of evil as embodied in the concept of maya is held simultaneously with sufficient belief in the objectivity of merit and demerit that makes karma operationally possible. The way is open, then, to the believer in an omnibenevolent deity or ultimate reality to see all things, good and evil, as an 'offering/ or an opportunity. What I mean is this: it challenges us for our response. And how we respond, what we do, both reveals who we are and makes us who we are, who we become. However, if the believer, or the theodicizing philosopher, wants to maintain that 'good comes from evil/ this concept must be understood correctly if it is not to fall apart into morally uncomfortable corollaries. For my own taste, any assertion that good can come from evil must never be decoupled from a vivid sense of our own moral responsibility. It seems vital to me to maintain that there is no guarantee what- soever that good will come from any evil committed by human beings, that there is no metaphysical law, some wondrous principle in the universe, that good will come out of evil if you just sit back and see your glass as half full until someone fills it up for you. Rather, one who maintains that good can, on occasion, come from evil ought to insist that good will come from evil only if we make it do so. The only way to be sure that good comes from evil is to ensure that it does. Ultimately the practical, operational response should be the only answer to the philosopher's prob- lem of evil. That is why the atheist who argues against the existence of God by starting from the existence of evil misses the point - but so does the believer - if they try to find an answer to the conundrum purely in the logic of things. If there is an omnibenevolent and omnipotent Deity or Ultimate Reality that is concerned with human moral de- velopment, why should he or she have willed there to be a merely logical solution to evil that works on paper without action on our part? Presumably a God of goodness and compassion who wills the same virtues for us does not want such a thing, that is, an answer to a philosophically vexing problem that will pointlessly satisfy the intel- lect with no need for us to take action to eliminate the evils in our communities. The point is not to resolve the tension with a logical remedy; the problem must be insol- uble and the tension must remain to drive us to a practical response. The spiritual response is not to prove QED that good comes from evil, but to set ourselves to the task of finding ways of bringing good outcomes from the evil actions of ourselves and others. Gwen Griffith-Dickson 579</page><page sequence="3">Some have sought to construct a theodicy on the belief that the good will out- weigh the evil in the end, predicated on the belief in redemption. I prefer instead to insist, as before, that there is no guarantee that the good outweighs the evil in the end, and God or we are justified in that way. Not only that, but I don't know how you could measure it even to make the comparison. How do you weigh the evil act, and how do you measure the good that follows in spite of it? I have no idea. I have no reason to think that the good we can sometimes make out of an evil action is any greater than the evil itself. I only know that away from the logic and the paper, in painful reality the alternative is worse: to allow evil to prosper, while we collapse, defeated by it. I would maintain that this is not tantamount to saying 'evil is really good/ or that it undesirably ascribes positive value to evil. To be inspired to acts of goodness in order to overcome evil confers no intrinsic value on the evil; if it could be said that evil acquires thereby a purely instrumental goodness I think it is nevertheless clear that goodness attaches to the response, not to the evil that is overcome by it. The goodness of human compassion is not, as it were, transitive. But what if it were? Would that not be an even more exciting outcome for the spiritual person: that the transformational power of human compassion in the face of evil is such that its good- ness can, in fact, be 'transitive' - that evil acts can, ultimately, be transformed by the goodness that meets them as a response? In our discussions of the problem, I wish we could leave behind the language of bookkeeping, could stop thinking that it all has to work out on some metaphysical spreadsheet, so that faith is justified if you can calculate that the total of good is larger than the total of evil. Meanwhile we could also leave behind the language of the boardroom, as if you could perform a cost-benefit analysis of human history racked up against the goodness of God in order to calculate whether or not the latter exists. So why has it become this way? It seems to me that the Western debate has been derailed by the polemical context it has acquired - or perhaps always had. The problem of evil has become the Verdun of philosophy of religion, a battleground endlessly fought over by atheists and 'theists' because it is the vital piece of territory to allow them domination in the war. Thus, a debate that is centuries old is given new life not only by the professionals but by new-atheist arrivistes to religious debates who appear to think that this is a new and decisive refutation of the super- stitions they hate. What this means, however, is that such polemics and histrionics have over- shadowed something more important: nonaggressive discussion and open-minded analysis, which could so easily encompass cooperating 'theists/ agnostics, and athe- ists, together seeking wisdom to understand what 'evil' is, its impact on our lives, and the many responses we could make. Instead, it has distorted the debate with the need to seek proof or defend faith - justification in the worst sense instead of explanation. If such cooperation seems too Utopian to contemplate, at least we could over- come one divide among philosophers, which is the East-West one. This was, as 580 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="4">Deutsch indicates, one of the aspirations of the book he has so kindly reviewed. One of the reasons for doing philosophy of religion cross-culturally is not to be fair, or politically (or philosophically) correct, or 'multicultural/ It is because it enriches the discipline and the understanding of issues to consider the full range of human reflection, rather than let our thinking be dictated to by random geographical cir- cumstances. This particular debate is one that would benefit particularly by an injec- tion from Indian philosophy, not least because it is not structured in the same theistic frame that has become ossified in Western arguments on evil. What could the Indian religions contribute? A richer understanding of human 'freedom' is one starting point. Western debates have suffered by restriction to dis- cussions of 'free will' as the only framework in which discussions of our freedom or lack of freedom can take place. Those religions with a doctrine of karma, on the other hand, throw powerful light on how far freedom is not some entitlement that we are born with, but rather an achievement if and when it occurs. (The present author discusses this further in the work reviewed, and rather more in Human and Divine [Duckworth, 2000].) The concept of God that is in operation can also be enlarged by widening the number of religious traditions that are allowed to take part in the debates on the problem of evil. One thing strikes me as curious in the theodicial debate: although it purports to consider the concept of God - indeed, hinges on God's attributes, goodness versus power - it remains peculiarly unquestioning on a central point, namely how the action and involvement of God in human history is conceived. An incompatibility between omnibenevolence and omnipotence (or God's existence itself) only arises if God is a being who intervenes in a hands-on way to avert the effects of evil human action. The classic challenge- 'If God was all-good and all- powerful He would not permit evil'- transparently presupposes that God is a being who permits, or doesn't. Few apart from the process theologians have sought a reso- lution to the problem by challenging this anthropomorphic and controlling concep- tion of the divine. But the way remains open even to comparatively 'conventional' Thomists, for example, as well as (historically) to those like Ibn Sina, to maintain that God is not a deus ex machina, and God's power is not to be conceived in terms of hands-on, rolled-up-sleeves action to stop the skidding cars of drunk drivers or the movement of troops by superpowers. A God who sustains all in being without med- dling in the day-to-day actions of those beings ('meticulous providence,' to give it a more dignified title) is one who leaves the consequences of these actions intact so as never to reduce our moral responsibility by minimizing the impact of our own moral choices. Might that not be a more plausible conception of greater moral goodness than a being who constantly subverts our moral agency by tidying up after our wick- edness, like an overprotective parent who never allows her child to suffer the conse- quences of his own irresponsibility? Such a conception meets the challenge of theo- dicy in a different way, and is not a concept of deity alien to some of the theistic strands of Indian religions. There does seem to be a persistent theme in these reflections: human moral re- sponsibility. And to make a confession: sometimes the tone in Western philosophical Gwen Griffith-Dickson 581</page><page sequence="5">arguments approaches what the psychologist Martin Seligman dubbed 'learned help- lessness/ The problems are too large for us; it should be down to God. Why is God not stepping up to sort it out for us? "Possibly because he doesn't exist" is the easiest answer. But for the believer, the insolubility of the problem on paper, in logic, ought to be seen as God's answer: "Don't try to justify me, justify yourselves. Why do you allow evil? 'Justify' yourselves not in argument but in action." Notes 1 - C. R. Mesle, John Hick's Theodicy: A Process Humanist Critique (London: Mac- millan, 1991); see pp. 22, 39. 2 - T. W.
