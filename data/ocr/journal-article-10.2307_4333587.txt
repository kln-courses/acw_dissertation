<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Crowe Ransom THE CONCRETE UNIVERSAL: OBSERVATIONS ON THE UNDERSTANDING OF POETRY II. M AY TITLE employs a famous working-phrase of Hegel's, and in the first of these papers I made some lay obser- vations about that philosopher's understanding of poetry. But Hegel's thought is a special development of Kant's, and the fact is that I am obliged to think of Kant as my own mentor. Kant is closer to modern criticism than Hegel is! So I shall talk of Kant's understanding of poetry, and at even greater length. But perhaps a small apologia is in order, perhaps it is already over- due,-for bringinig philosophy into the literary discussion. I don't know how it is possible to (leny to the literary critic the advantagcs of philosoply; I suppose we have fears that he, or his audience, will be unequal to them. But doesn't he try for a radical and decisive understanding of poetry? I could believe that he should be deniedl if I thought it must follow that, having once got into philosophy, he would never get out again. This would mean that resiliency had gone for some reason from his working consciousness, that the fateful time hadl come when the usual succession of its moods and interests must break down; which would be distressing if it did not seem arbitrary. Probably the critic's ordinary job is to interpret the poem in common language that is not philosophical, and does not stray far from the literary text. We think of him as trying to induce the right public reception of the poem when he has come straight</page><page sequence="2">384 CONCRETE UNIVERSAL from his own experience of it. And we think his performance will be a little barbarous if some of the warmth of the object does not carry over into his presentation, and even some of the graces of its language. The reading of technical philosophy is the critic's home work. It should be fruitful of radical and decisive ideas-if his mind is strong enough to take them. But can he afford to immerse his mind in the stiff and graceless language? He will be safe if his passion for his art is incorruptible. Indeed, the whole intention is to save him from unconscious errors, like some cheapening of the poem's effect, or some wretched exclusions that he might feel inclined to make within its meaning,-which would be like having the lie within his soul, more killing than jargon, if we must compare one evil with another. The philosophical under- standing of poetry as we have it now is almost entirely a thing that has been achieved by the moderns; Concrete Universal is one of its key phrases. But even here the philosophers do not speak with one voice; as doubtless they never will. It is the critic's privilege to have a mind of his own when caught in the disagree- ments among the doctors. And he has at least one enormous advantage over the philosophers: he is intimate, and it must be very rare if they are intimate, with the immediate pulsing fact which is his poem. He doesn't promise to accept a philosophical disposition of his poem which seems not to have very much to do with the felt reality of the thing. Must he then assume the burden of being a critic of philosophy as well as literature? But the added labor does not mean the doubling of his burden. His single role is still the understanding of poetry, and while this is made surer and firmer it is really being made easier. I suppose we can scarcely say that philosophy as a part of the critical discipline is according to Arnold, or according to Eliot. It is according to Richards, and it is according to Coleridge. I find it pleasant to believe that the special revival of Coleridge in our time, in our language, signifies that critics direct their</page><page sequence="3">JOHN CROWE RANSOM 385 thought again to the heroic time when Augustan poetry, with its intricate surfaces and its abhorrence of passion, had played itself out finally, and was being succeeded by the fresh concert of the Romantics; when the poets themselves were amateurs of philosophy, and aware of the late or even the living philosophers of their art. The new philosophy was German. Schiller was its best spokesman in Germany among the poets and critics, and Coleridge, though scarcely Schiller's equal in speculative force, was his counterpart in English. The great philosophical name, of course, was that of Kant. We are still under the domination of an aesthetic humanism which we must call either Kantian or post-Kantian. And when we plunge into the first-rate sequence of poets which includes Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, Keats, we at once take the impression that they are purposeful, dedicated, even programmatic, to a degree hardly equaled by another set of individual poets living in a single age. They had a common preoccupation with a certain understanding of poetry, and they had got it partly from the literary critics, but more and more it tended to go back to Kant, or to those critics who had assimilated their own views to Kant's. Now it will be said that they had also a preoccupation with political freedom, and the politics of revolution. But this one was not so leading. Perhaps it is more intense than the other preoccupation in Byron, but the case is just reversed in Keats; and both preoccupations are strong in Shelley. At any rate, as we proceed we come much too soon, for our mood, to Tennyson, and feel a cooling-off of our spirits; the epoch must have gone already, for here the succession passes once more to the nondescript, the poet who has received many gifts from the Muses but must take a long time deciding what had best be done with them,-and there won't be anything par- ticularly philosophical in his decision when he makes it. A little later we come to Browning, and Browning has a great deal of the Romantic philosophy in his equipment. Whether he borrows or originates it I do not know, though the former</page><page sequence="4">386 CONCRETE UNIVERSAL seems the more likely; but at any rate there has been the break already, and we do not associate him with the movement. Then there is the third Victorian poet, Mattlhew Arnold, about whom we shall always have very mixed feelings. His be- ginnings may inspire us to fancy that Keats has come to life again. But there is quickly a breakdown, the Keatsian strain is stifled, as Arnold proceeds to argue himself out of the Romantic move- ment. The effect is to convert the author of "The Strayed Reveller," and of the Callicles part of "Empedocles," into an in- tellectual poet, or an academic poet; though lhe may still indulge himself occasionally in some nostalgic echo of his early self. Arnold criticized the Romantics because they "did not know enough"; in England they had then no proper "current of ideas" to nourish them. Let us say simply, Nobody knows enough; or hardly anybody. Let that be the ample blanket which will cover the Romantics; but it must cover Arnold too; he did not fail to acquaint himself with the German literary critics, but he did not take them in their Kantian phase. When he talks about poetry we know that Kant's firm understanding of it has never reached him, or at least that it has never touched him. The physical death of Keats at an early age is painful to us, but worse, perhaps, is the death of the poet in the living Arnold, and I for one, on the present occasion, will not be consoled by thinking of the value of the public man who emerged from the ruin. I am ready to agree that Arnold was the happiest of all the rhetoricians in our language who have dedicated themselves to the public cause; that is to say, the most engaging schoolmaster who ever teased and scolded his bad pupils into bothering about "the best that has been thought and uttered in the world." But Arnold was not con- genitally interested in the radical and decisive thought of the philosophers. CONCRETE UNIVERSAL is a useful term for systematic philos- ophy. Hegel hit upon it, but Kant might easily have used it, and I</page><page sequence="5">JOHN CROWE RANSOM 387 think he would have explained scrupulously the difference if he should have used it for two different kinds of occasion. Let us re- turn to the vernacular to clear up this term, if we think that the critic may feel a little bewildered by the jargon, but that it allows of being translated into something more commonplace with which he is bound to be familiar. A Universal in Hegel's favorite sense is any idea in the mind which proposes a little universe, or organ- ized working combination of parts, where there is a whole and single effect to be produced, and the heterogeneous parts must perform their several duties faithfully in order to bring it about. Thus the formula of a chemical reaction; the recipe for a dish; the blue-print of a machine; or even, to the extent in which it is practicable, Newman's "idea of a university." It becomes a Con- crete Universal when it has been materialized and is actually working. The Universal by itself is the design as it exists in the understanding, and if we ask what is the Concrete by itself we must say, I imagine, that it is the objective element in which the Universal in all its parts is to be materialized. Nevertheless, when we read Kant and Hegel, it must occur to us that there appear to be two kinds of Concrete Universal which are radically distinct. First, as the easier one by far for us to follow, there is the Concrete Universal as we find it exempli- fied a thousand times in the operations of applied science. We do not there raise a question which has agitated many recent literary critics when they think of a poem as a Concrete Universal: whether the Concrete or working Universal realizes in precise measure the blue-print, the Universal in the mind, or whether there is more Concreteness than is actually needed. Science means to have its Concrete Universal just right, and has it so; and the crucial factor in getting it right would perhaps be the determina- tion of the scientist, if he does not find the right parts already existing in the state of nature, to alter the materials he does find, prepare them, till they become right; compound them or purify them, grow them or manufacture them, fit them to size and</page><page sequence="6">388 CONCRETE UNIVERSAL shape, and so on; in the Universal as designed there are specifica- tions which they must meet. So the parts of the finished Concrete Universal do have their blue-print perfection, perhaps as follows: Not one necessary part missing; nor one unnecessary part show- ing; nor a part showing which is either excessive or deficient in its action even though some one might be (by the carelessness of the designer, or the stubbornness of the material), and still not fail to do its work after a fashion. If we insist that engines and scientific processes are never perfect, and as a matter of fact are continually being improved upon, the answer is that at any rate they are perfectible; and in particular that the scientists are free to make any possible use of nature to obtain the specified parts, and are not to be deterred by any sentimental regard for nature. But it is odd that literary critics should claim, so many of them (they would be banking heavily on Aristotle the ancient critic), that this same rigorous organization obtains within a poem; that the Universal or logical plan of the poem is borne out perfectly in the sensuous detail which puts it into action; and that this Concrete is used up so completely in the service of the Universal that there is no remainder. I believe this notion could not have occurred to either Kant or Hegel, because of one radical consideration which must have seemed to them too obvious to dwell upon. A poem has a rather wide and indefinite purpose, as compared with a scientific or practical operation. Kant offered a new version of the essential human history behind a poem, and Hegel ac- cepted it without any particular question. Speaking broadly, we are given to saying that applied science attends busily to our explicit appetitive or organic needs, and a scientific Universal is a workable concept seen in that perspective. Now the Universal of the poem is a moral Universal. There is difficulty enough, as we are well aware, when we try to locate the common moral im- pulse in the animal perspective of human nature, and many</page><page sequence="7">JOHN CROWE RANSOM 389 humanists follow Kant in saying that it is a "higher" impulse and requires us ultimately to posit a Supreme Being and an eternal Moral Order, if we mean to find a steady perspective in which to regard it objectively. That is, the understanding of common morality takes some metaphysical speculation to ac- complish; or, if that is not everywhere accepted, at the least it requires of whatever thinker a far more radical and imaginative psychology and anthropology than existed in Kant's time. All the same, the moral Universal often enough is perfectly explicit; that is, when we are in a situation where we see our duty clearly, and do it without question. That is morality in action, and Kant has treated it firmly in his Critique of Practical Reason, second of the big books in his trilogy. In a moral action we treat other per- sons as ends, not means; and if we propose to confer material benefits upon them we shall have to treat nature as a means and not an end, precisely as the scientists or other practical people do in working their Universals. And there might conceivably be a poetry aiming simply at our moral improvement, representing the most exemplary be- haviors in or(ler to move us to like behaviors. Doubtless there actually is such a poetry; but Kant despises it if he notices it, and Hegel after him. A little less disreputable (less absurdly simple) would be a kind of poetry given to representing moral situations where it is difficult not so much to do one's duty, as to know just which among the several possibilities is the duty one must do; exemplary in its practical judgments, in the nicety of its distinc- tion among the moral ideas. Here we come close to Hegel's weak- ness and, by the same token, to Hegel's strength. But still this is not poetry as Kant conceives it consistently, or as Hegel conceives it ideally. The moral Universal whose Concrete embodiment is a poem is different in its technique from that moral Universal, or from any other practicable Universal, which exacts from nature its prescribed parts and goes to work with them. Its object in a poem</page><page sequence="8">390 CONCRETE UNIVERSAL is surely "reflective," but since that is a weak word let us say it is metaphysical, as we must construe it; it is of an elemental im- portance which we feel profoundly even if we do not easily identify it. But we may start with the technical distinction, which is this: the moral Universal of the poem does not use nature as a means but as an end; it goes out into nature not as a predatory conquerer and despoiler but as an inquirer, to look at nature as nature naturally is, and see what its own reception there may be. The moral Universal takes a journey into nature, so to speak, and the Concrete element is an area of nature existing in its natural conformations as these are given, and discovered, not a Concrete element which it means to ransack for materials which are to be exacted of nature. It is for this reason that it seems idle for literary critics to raise the question whether, within the traversed region of nature, the unpredictable and highly particular detail of the local "manifold of sense" is going to enter precisely and without remainder into the formal Universal. That is too much to expect. We shall be glad to settle for much less than that. The sort of hospitality offered to our moral Universal by the Concrete of the natural world will need to be convincing, if it is to do us any goocd, but on the other hand the Universal is a mannerly and modest sort of tourist. I shall have to go into that topic by stages; it is not an easy topic; it is Kant's topic, and he makes it very clear in principle, but does not offer many case-histories for the benefit of the weak laity's understanding of poetry. Let me clear up my feeling with regard to Hegel, in order to continue the better with Kant. There is a temperamental dif- ference between Kant and Hegel. I think of Hegel as a benign yet extremely aggressive spirit to whom we have to attribute at last an intention as ambitious and simple as the following: to push the moral Universal like any other common Universal out into the objective world, where it is to enforce its presence, and in doing so to make that world over, even if only a little at a time; it will amount finally (in a "power age" like ours) to a</page><page sequence="9">JOHN CROWE RANSOM 391 reformation of nature, as when it takes the form of substituting modern urban life for the old agrarian life. Up to a certain point the new world will be the natural one, so long as its forms may seem suited to our primitive moral feeling. And poetry will record its happiest moments. But under the speed-up of the Universals, the moral pressure grows so brisk and demanding that the natural world simply becomes humanized, socialized, and made over, a pure convenience which in its own right is quite disregarded. There will be an endless evolution in the complexity of human society, in its manners and ideals, its institutions and states, and this is one way to make the best of our curious existence; it is a very muscular way. There will be no poetry at this stage, because no honor can be wasted on nature. Poetry has already had its day, says Hegel. He speaks with a proud can(lor of the beauty which vanished with thie classical arts (when even deities were anthropomorphic and could be sculptured from living models), and of that modern phase which he calls Romantic art, and in which nature appears only as atomized and re-combined into forms which the moral Universal contrives for it. I offer some samplings of his temper:1 In the Romantic, therefore, we have two worlds. The one is the spiritual realm, which is complete in itself-the soul, which finds its reconciliation within itself, and which now for the first time bends around the otherwise rectilinear repetition of genesis, destruction and renewal, to the true circle, to return-into-self, to the genuine Phoenix- life of the spirit. The other is the realm of the external, as such, which, shut out from a firmly cohering unity with the spirit, now becomes a wholly empirical actuality, respecting whose form the soul is un- concerned. . . Here . . . has vanished that ideal beauty which fhas sought to] replace its imperfect development by the blooming beauty of existence. Romantic Art no longer has for its aim this free vitality of actual 1. Translated by W. M. Bryant from the Lectures in Aesthetics, in the recent Philos- ophy of Hegel, edited by Carl J. Friedrich. Modern Library.</page><page sequence="10">392 CONCRETE UNIVERSAL existence, in its infinite caliness and subnaergence of the soul in the corporeal, nor even this life, as such, in its most precise significance, but turns its back upon this highest phase of beauty. Indeed, it inter- weaves its inner being with the accidentality of external organization, and allows unrestricted play room to the marked characteristics of the ugly.... Thus though the soul is still destined to p1ass through the world, it no longer pursues merely worldly aims and undertakings. Rather, it has for its essential purpose and endeavor the inner struggle of man within himself, and his reconciliation with God, and brings into repre- sentation only personality and its conservation, together with applianices for the accomplishment of this end.... Hegel is already at the point of abandoning nature, for the sake of realizing the modern society. But it is clear to him-he is in that degree still a Kantian-that this means the abandonment of poetry and art. He is the prototype of all "moderns" who work at the organization of society. His position is little different from that of the "social" school of literary critics who hold on to prose fiction as an art while (virtually) abandoning poetry. My own feeling would be that in spite of the pressures of modern urban society, Hegel's example is not obligatory upon critics and artists; and that it is a very real question whether there is an art or a fiction whichi has no poetry in it. If I read Kant correctly, his is the more poetic soul, and the greater piety. I have come to think of him as the most radical and ultimate spokesman for poetry that we have had. We must ap- prove his philosophical background. It was a British philosopher who woke him from his "dogmatic slumber," and conditioned him to the sort of intellectual scruple with which an empirical thinker faces the facts of life and of nature. The immediate con- sequence was one which lasted a painful while: the grim convic- tion that we must divide our effort between two sundered worlds, the free moral world which is wholly inner, and the natural world which is external but determinate and mechanical. (We</page><page sequence="11">JOHN CROWE RANSOM 393 know about the mechanical universe which Newton and his suc- cessors had furnished by Kant's time.) But finally he made the epoch-making discovery which seemed to bridge the abyss be- tween them. To put this as simply as I can. There is no specific, singled-out event in nature which the understanding cannot re- gard as altogether externally caused. But nature when we look hard refuses to be specific and single; it is everywhere itself, a dense "manifold of sense," a tissue of events whose effects are massive and intricate beyond the grasp of the understanding. It is Kant's monumental achievement to have discerned how it is that nature nevertheless sometimes appears beautiful. These are the times when, preoccupied with our own freedom and purpose, we find that nature likewise seems free and purposive. To be sure, Kant will not allow us to say that nature's purpose is the same as ours, or that we quite understand it; we cannot claim, for example, that it is a moral purpose; but at least it seems sympa- thetic with our moral purpose. And the happiest consequences follow. The human kingdom and the natural kingdom appear like free and harmonious powers, collaborating with each other in dignity and peace; and in the sequel the poetic imagination is able to set up memorials of art which bear witness to their con- cord. Or if we require a bourgeois figure: we do not have to feel still that the natural world is our alien habitation, for now it is our home. Or it is "our element." So it is not as if we had been deposited in a world in which we could not live with dignity unless we should build us a city and immure ourselves in a society. Kant cites readily an instance or so of natural beauty. In a garden the foliage or the blossoms of the plants will answer in- sofar as the general profile is concerned to the gardener's geo- metrical Universal, yet their configuration in its profuse detail is much too intricate, and spontaneous-looking to account for, and implies energies not used up by the Universal. It is as if the plants obeyed the law of their placement only to exhibit their own free- dom beneath it the more luxuriantly. We have learned to think</page><page sequence="12">394 CONCRETE UNIVERSAL that this is just the right condition in which they will manifest their grace, or their beauty. And Kant has supplied the paradigm of natural beauty. (Was there anticipation of this paradigm? Not quite, I think, on philosophical grounds.) Nature seems to have no inclination to reject or even to resent the human Uni- versal, for now obtains the condition of "freedom under the law," and its consequence of beauty. In these or similar terms the paradigm is recited nearly everywhere. If this is natural beauty, what is poetry? Kant's view is simple, and for all except the new "symbolist" critics who desire for poetry a "creativity" upon which there are to be no limits, it will be adequate: Poetry is the representation of natural beauty. The spectacular faculty of Imagination is its agent. Kant calls it the faculty of presentation, and says it is equivalent in the poet to Genius. The play between the understanding with its moral Universal on the one hand, and on the other hand Imagination presenting the purposive Concrete of nature, is unpredictable and inexhaustible. Coleridge, at least by the time of the Bio- graphia Litereria, made a sort of official English version of Kant's view, and critics are familiar with it. No statement is more studied than the sudden and enormous sentence at the bottom of Chapter XIV (in lieu of a great deal of promised text) in which the under- standing and the imagination are paired ten times or so; the one which begins: "This power [Imagination], first put in action by the will and understanding and retained under their irremissive, though gentle and unnoticed, control (laxis etertur habenis) reveals itself in the balance or reconciliation of opposite or dis- cordant qualities....." But I do not think it can be sai(d that Cole- ridge explains the purpose of the pairings. The understanding is possessed by its own universal and lacks language to utter it; the imagination supplies it, in fact over-supplies it, with a natural or metaphorical expression. Kant hammered many times on the right way to construe the complex experience of beauty. He did not develop all the</page><page sequence="13">JOHN CROWE RANSOM 395 implications, nor provide systematic illustration. I will have to quote a small English poem which makes nature purposive with an almost excessive clarity, and indeed carries a tag of identifica- tion so pointed as to be embarrassing: The year's at the spring And day's at the morn; Morning's at seven; The hill-side's dew-pearled; The lark's on the wing; The snail's on the thorn: God's in his heaven- All's right with the world. Little Pippa sings this song in passing, and a pair of guilty lovers recall their lost innocence and take to quarreling, like Adam and Eve after their Fall. Pippa's Universal is a feeling of joy, intense but diffused over every act and thought. (She is innocent, and this is her holiday from the silk mills.) She spends three lines dating the occasion very precisely, as Wordsworth might have identified his moment of illumination by way of his note-book, or even in the poem itself. Then come three details which con- stitute the Concrete: the hillside, the lark, the snail. A poem can- not and need not list all the details of the "manifold," only enough, and in variety startling enough, to make a fair sampling. We are given to understand that everything is joyful like Pippa, that all nature is animate(1 in the morning light. And that would be the poem; except that she must conclude by putting in her theological Universal, in which she has been well instructed: the world rejoices because Pippa's Godl is now its God too, and he is in his heaven or(dering all. Kant would not have approved her tag. He was solicitous that the flowering of nature should not be subjected to the moral and theological Universals; for it could easily be that these are peculiar to the human understanding. It might be self-deception if we had wanted to discover that nature was moral and then</page><page sequence="14">396 CONCRETE UNIVERSAL proceeded to discover it. The nature-lover who studies actual nature, and the poet who imagines nature, must be on their guard against this possibility. The veteran critics of poetry today need no prompting to be on their guard. Here is a passage in which the poet does not impose human responsibility upon nature quite so complacently. Shakespeare lived before the Romantics built up their great volume of busi- ness with nature, and in Cymbeline we observe his royal boys (who have been reared in the lap of nature, housed in a cave) as they stand by the grave of Fidele and improvize a funeral service. One of them says: With fairest flowers While summer lasts and I live here, Fidele, I'll sweeten thy sad grave; thou shalt not lack The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor The azured harebell, like thy veins, no, nor The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander, Outsweetened not thy breath: the ruddock would, With charitable bill,C-O bill! sore-shaming Those rich-left heirs, that let their fathers lie Without a monument,-bring thee all this; Yea, and furred moss besides, when flowers are none, To winter-ground thy corse. This is so handsome that we think, and perhaps we are not wrong, that Shakespeare has lent his own feeling to it. The flowers are gathered by human hands, and they resemble Fidele only in exterior features, not spiritually. But the speaker adds that if he were not bringing them, the red-breast (or ruddock) would; which mght be crucial except that this sort of thing may be according to the folklore of red-breasts. (I find a small evidence in the new Standard Dictionary of Folklore.) It is an enticing idea all the same, for the poet goes on into an aside over the bird's "charitable bill" and offers the apostrophe beginning "O bill!"</page><page sequence="15">JOHN CROWE RANSOM 397 It is a mawkish moment of danger. But the other prince, the practical younger one, saves the situation when he scolds his brother for the speech: Prithee, have done, And do not play in wench-like words with that Which is so serious. And Shakespeare has put up his guard, his decent Kantian reservation. It would be wrong to give the impression that in a poem, necessarily, the intellectual Universal has always disappeared from sight and now exists only in the Concrete. It is my impression that as often as not a poem will recite its two versions, side by side. Thus Portia, commending mercy, explains that mercy does not come by compulsion but spontaneously or by grace: its quality is "not strained," or, as we would say, "unconstrained." That is the moral Universal. Then comes the poetic consummation. As if this abstract talk of the Universal might not be quite intelligible, she adds, "It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven / Upon the place beneath." And in the following passage the poet Yeats, who likes to show the strain of his intellectual ideas, looks hard at his metaphor or Concrete before he accepts it for his Universal: Some moralist or mythological poet Compares the solitary soul to a swan; I am satisfied with that, Satisfied if a troubled mirror show it, Before that brief gleam of its life be gone, An image of its state: The wings half spread for flight, The breast thrust out in pride, Whether to play or to ride Those winds that clamor of approaching night. But it may be quite otherwise. By a tour de force which for more reasons than one we are apt to call "metaphysical," the Universal</page><page sequence="16">398 CONCRETE UNIVERSAL of a poem may be wholly translated into a natural image, or a series of them, and never expressed in the abstract language of the understanding at all; as in that Shakespearian sonnet whiclh begins the first of three images with "That time of year thou mayst in me behold." Probably it is normal, when the Universal receives a meta- phorical or natural image, for the Universal to come first; tenor precedes vehicle, as we say it today. But we must observe that this order may be reversed. A natural object or conformation strikes our attention because it seems significant of more than mechanical effect, and we proceed to equate it metaphorically with the appropriate human Universal. In this case we start with nature and humanize it; in the other case we started with the human Universal and naturalized it. How, for example, shall the modern poet explain his depression over the late evening that has not even the dignity of a sunset sky? It is "spread out against the sky / Like a patient etherized upon the table"; as if it might not survive the operation. Kant himself observes that the poem may begin at either end of the process. He quotes "a certain poet" observing the sunrise and then moralizing it: The sun arose As calm from virtue springs. Here the observer was not satisfied with noting for the calendar, or the meteorological record, the fact that the sun rose clear, but elected to find, in Kant's words, that it "diffuses in the mind a multitude of sublime and restful feelings and a boundless prospect of a joyful future, to which no expression measured by a definite concept [i.e., keeping to the tenor] completely attains." Marvell combines with his sophistication or worldliness an extravagant love of gardens and nature. He often begins a meta- phor with a natural object, and sometimes humanizes it almost absurdly. But his guard is up, too, and his tone is therefore apt to be waggish. Thus his Mower addresses the Glowworms in</page><page sequence="17">JOHN CROWE RANSOM 399 one poem: Ye living lamps, by whose dear light The nightingale does sit so late, And studying all the summer night Her matchless songs does meditate; Ye country comets, that portend No war nor prince's funeral, Shining unto no higher end Than to presage the grass's fall. His famous "Garden" poem has burlesque moments along with its proper beauties; he pretends to picture the Garden as his pre- ferred and adequate element, supplying him with natural satis- factions which are of the same kind as those he could have had in the human society: No white nor red was ever seen So amorous as this lovely green. Fond lovers, cruel as their flame, Cut in these trees their mistress' name: Little, alas, they know, or heed, Hov far these beauties hers exceed! Fair trees, wheresoe'er your barks I wound No name shall but your own be found. And he is quite direct and not metaphorical in "Bermudas" where the colonists sing of the kindness of the natural element with which God has provided them: He gave us this eternal spring, Which here enamels everything; And sends the fowls to us in care, On daily visits through the air. He hangs in shades the orange bright, Like golden lamps in a green night. And does in the pomgranates close Jewels more rich than Ormus shows.</page><page sequence="18">400 CONCRETE UNIVERSAL He makes the figs our mouths to meet; And throws the melons at our feet. But apples plants of such a price, No tree could ever bear them twice. With cedars, chosen by his hand, From Lebanon, he stores the land, And makes the hollow seas that roar, Proclaim the ambergris on shore. He cast (of which we rather boast) The gospel's pearl upon our coast. And in these rocks for us did frame A temple, where to sound his name. The category for the Universal here would be that of literal re- ligious faith. The purpose of nature is identified completely with the purposes of Providence; and this naivete is justified dramat- ically, since the pious colonists are made to row their boat to the beat of the hymn, but it does not square with the canon. Wallace Stevens has written a poem expressly under the title of "The Motive for Metaphor," and Kant, I think, would have accepted it as a stylized but competent variation upon his own view: You like it under the trees in autumn, Because everything is half dead. The Wind moves like a cripple among the leaves And repeats words without meaning. In the same way, you were happy in spring, With the half colors of quarter-things, The slightly brighter sky, the melting clouds, The single bird, the obscure moon- The obscure moon lighting an obscure world Of things that would never be quite expressed, Where you yourself were never quite yourself And did not want nor have to be.</page><page sequence="19">JOHN CROWE RANSOM 401 Desiring the exhilaration of changes: The motive for metaphor, shrinking from The weight of primary noon, The A B C of being, The ruddy temper, the hammer Of red and blue, the hard sound- Steel against intimation-the sharp flash, The vital, arrogant, fatal, dominant X. That is to say, I think, something like the following. You like metaphor in the autumn, because you cannot express yourself, except to say that the wind cannot express itself, either. You like it in the spring, because instead of trying to express what you feel then, you can speak of how the obscure moon lights an obscure world. You like it because it is exhilarating, and alternative to the dreary searching of your own mind for the meaning of your state. [There must be many a moral Universal seeking its poetry though it is no better than a moral feeling; so much of the moral life turns on feeling, and on half-successful reflection, and can scarcely ever be satisfied except with a poetic expression or its homely equivalent.] The moral Universal is intolerably harsh and simple, when you phrase it, not equal to what you want it to mean, and in fact it is the "vital, arrogant, fatal, dominant X"; it is inexpressive, like the sign of an unknown quantity. So much more visible, more audible, more tangible, better focussed for observation, are the behaviors of nature which the poet can draw upon because they are expressive. This poem makes an important remark in a very casual manner, and many of us will already pos- sess a notion, as I imagine, that no poet has written more verse about the understanding of poetry than Stevens has done, unless it was Wordsworth. If it had not been Richard Blackmur who wrote recently about Stevens as a poet not only dandiacal but unphilosophical, I should have boggled at both ascriptions, and thought that Blackmur's own guard was down, most unaccount-</page><page sequence="20">402 CONCRETE UNIVERSAL ably. But it was Blackmur, and Blackmur as a critic is so far from having an impediment in his speech that he excels other critics in the plenitude of his contexts, so that I dare say there are in- timations in the one on Stevens which amount to proper quali- fications; or amount partly to them. The fullest quotation of verse in Kant's own writing seems to be the one from the poem by Frederick the Great written in French: "Sur les vaines terreurs de la mort et les frayeurs d'une autre vie." Although Kant translated the verse into German for his own text, our English editor and translator supplies it in the original language:2 Oui, finissons sans trouble et mourons sans regrets, En laissant l'univers comble de nos bienfaits. Ainsi l'astre du jour au bout de sa carriere Repand sur l'horizon une douce lumiere; Et les derniers rayons qu'il darde dans les airs, Sont les derniers soupirs qu'il donne 'a l'univers. The King at the end of his full life is metaphorically represented by the sun taking a last look round upon the world he has illuminated before he goes down. That is all, but the sun's moment is a rich one. Kant comments that here the great King . . . quickens his rational Idea of a cosmopolitan dis- position at the end of life by an attribute which the Imagination (in remembering all the pleasures of a beautiful summer day that are recalled at its close by a serene evening) associates with that represen- tation, and which excites a number of sensations and secondary repre- sentations for which no expression is found. No expression is found in the tenor for the sensations and sec- ondary representations, which therefore are assigned to the ve- hicle to express. Is it that no expression can be found in the tenor, that the language of feeling is too dumb, too poor, to allow of 2. Kant's Critiquie of ItJdgment, translated and edited by J. H. Bernard.

And if it is so, then Kant in effect is saying precisely what Mr. Cleanth Brooks as a modern critic has been saying to his own public over and over: that "there is no other way" for language to express what it wants to express witlhout having recourse to metaphor; without going to the concrete of nature for its analogy. I cannot think that Kant would have re- pudliated his imnplication, but that he would hiave stated it with his usual boldness-if he could have foreseen the difficult pass- ages, and the imnpasses, which the subsequent course of literary criticism would encounter, and the need of developing his own principles to cover many possibilities. THE UNDERSTANDING of poetry which I have attributed to Kant in these notes is less than the whole of that philosopher's deliverance; but I think I have indicated the burden of it. I have venture(d to furnish him with a word which perhaps will describe in our time, and for our critics, the way of the imagination in giving objective or Concrete existence to the homeless moral Uni- versal. The word is metaphor, and Kant makes no particular use of it. He has not supplied poetic studies detailed enough, or in number enough, to have fixed on it for his regular word. But it would seem a decisive word for his understanding of poetry; it gives us the sense of nature accepting the Universal readily into its infinite system, and lending to it what metaphysical sanction is possible. Many critics of our time, starting let us say with Richards and coming on now at least to Professor Wimsatt, have uttered bold ideas about metaphor, and I have not gone far beyond some of them. To say "metaphor" tirelessly, with brutal repetition, is one militant way of defending nature as the element to which the Universal is referred, and therefore the element to which poetry has to look. I think the defenders of poetry would not mind say- ing that they are not prepared to abandon nature, because that would be the abandonment of metaphor, which in turn would</page><page sequence="22">404 CONCRETE UNIVERSAL mean the abandonment of poetry; which, when they have weighed it, would be a serious abridgment of the range of human experience. The alternative to sticking by nature and poetry is to follow Hegel's view that the moderns are now so far advanced with their perfectly specific and practicable Universals, their faith in these is so sure, and the conduct of them fulfills so completely the range of our demands, that nothing remains for the human spirit but to put all its strength into society and politics. My critics are scarcely going to agree with that. But critics are notoriously impressionistic, as perhaps it is their business to be; and every day I have a new sense of the wide spread of that Hegelian type of modernity. I can liken myself modestly to Arnold in the respect that, though I am not an in- spector of schools, I have done a long turn as a schoolmaster of poetry, and even acquired some professional anecdotes of my own. The latest one is not ten days old. A former pupil, after spending several years in business employment, came to me to say that he wished now to go on to a graduate school for further studies in literature; and to ask if I might tell him at what university he might find teachers whose interest was concentrated upon modern fiction, therefore upon the social sensibility. As for the teachers of poetry, who abound in the universities, he explained that in his business life he had been so impressed with his social respon- sibility that he could not longer bear to read works in that old- fashioned art. And though I was shocked by his apostasy, I was not so shocked but that I was able with a straight face to tell him what he wanted to know, so far as my information permitted. I assured him with all sincerity that the masters of morality now- adays were indeed the sociologists, who understood the moral pressures of modern society, and that among the ablest sociolo- gists, and even among the most learned sociologists, were many literary critics whose professional occupation was with fiction. I have also had experiences showing how a certain practical kind of religiosity, like practical morality when it possesses us,</page><page sequence="23">JOHN CROWE RANSOM 405 is capable of getting in between the soul and its reception of poetry and literature. This is when the soul is a timid soul and prefers the security of dogma to the dreadful facts of life and the pusillanimous dialectic by which poetry deals with them. But I do not wish to recite these experiences; they are not pretty stories and even the humor of them is painful. I remark that the poet's theology is metaphorical, and the poet knows it is metaphorical, and insists like Keats in holding by a rule of Negative Capa- bility,-which is not a Kantian phrase, but sounds like one, and might have been one if Kant, once more, had elaborated his views further than he did. By this rule a theological representation is in terms of our understanding of this world, and though it is hope- ful it is far from determining about any other world. And if people are young enough and adventurous enough to go to col- lege, they ought not to cheat themselves of those beautiful yet mortal representations offered them in literature. To go only a little further. What is, characteristically, the religious faith of a poet? Or, if strictly speaking he has nothing quite orthodox to show under that head, what is the sort of faith which he does have? The faith of Kant the philosopher was formed on intellectual grounds, it was other-worldly yet of ex- treme Protestant severity, quite declining to let the imagination of this world give it a form. I should say that we might call the poet's piety a "natural" piety, his gift being for finding the natural world not merely mechanical but hospitable to the moral Uni- versals. In literature this piety is recorded perhaps in that later mood of Wordsworth's, arrived at during the years between the other-worldly opening of the "Ode on Intimations of Immortal- ity" and its more modest and slightly sad conclusion. But, regard- less of what might have been Kant's professional feelings, I would like to borrow here from another philosopher. The poet's faith, I should say, is that this is "the best of all possible worlds"; in- asmuch as it is not possible for imagination to acquaint us with any other world. It is a horrid as well as a beautiful world, but</page><page sequence="24">406 CONCRETE UNIVERSAL without the horror we should never focus the beauty; without death there would be no relish for life; without danger, no courage; without savagery, no gentleness; and without the back- ground of our frequent ignominy, no human dignity and pride. (These are excellent and rather Hegelian commonplaces.) Words- worth at the beginning of his Ode advanced the ancient doctrine of metempsychosis, without remarking that there is provided traditionally, betwixt the residence of the soul in one world an(d its residence in another world, a Lethean bath to bring forget- fulness of that nature which the soul has just lived with; in order that it may adapt to whatever nature may be next in order. MOST OF KANT's understanding of poetry-if we except the middle section of the work wlhich is concerned with the sublime -is devoted to that high moment in which we sudldenly perceive what we may call the Epiphany of Beauty. It uses up the whole of a poetry, with the Universals of the min(d deploying against the natural metaphors, and then our recognition of the conse- quence, to create this show. Kant's understanding therefore chooses to regard poetry as a single and powerful though com- plicated action; and that is the kin(d of view which is deeply coveted by the modern critics. It is a complete view-except for one reservation which is anticlimactic, and a little embarrassing, and after all not exactly trifling. Kant's description is of a poetic phrase, or passage, or of a short poem; it is the description of a lyrical effect-if we can divorce that term from the idlea of music, which does not come under Kant's notice as essential-or of a moment of illumina- tion; it is the soul of poetry caught brieflv, but completely andl characteristically. And yet-what are we to say about long poems? about philos- ophical poems, or epics, or poetic narratives, or poetic dramas? It cannot often be that the action focuses upon a single meta- phorical or metaphysical moment. The chances are, overwhelm-</page><page sequence="25">JOHN CROWE RANSOM 407 ingly, that the moral Universal in such cases is a considerable and organized sequence of intellectual ideas, or of historical events, embodied for action and working themselves out; or, it is just possible, not clearly embodied, and only talking themselves out; and the best we can hope for, as Kantians, is that there are many happy metaphorical transformations, or little poetries, in the course of the poem, and perhaps a conclusion suited to the faith of a poet. This order of poetry will be much more put together, or synthetic, than the lyric, and more capable, indeed more de- manding, of being separated by analysis into its primary parts. A different thing. And a different story for critics, though not altogether. With poetry of this sort I have sometimes been at pains to defend the right of the intellectuals (the moralists or religionists) to isolate the ideas and discuss them on their intellectual merits; inasmuch as the ideas are surely in the poetry; and ideas demand discussion by intellectuals, the very best intellectuals who will offer. This is a poetry that can be taken apart. And yet if it is really a poetry it cannot be hurt; and Kantians can come back to the whole poetry and see what is poetical about it.
