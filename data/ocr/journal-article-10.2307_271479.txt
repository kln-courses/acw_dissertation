<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Literature of Race and Culture "TEMPLE OF THE FIRE BAPTIZED" Go TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN. By James Baldwin. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1953. 303 pp. $3.50. James Baldwin has written a very fine first novel. It is a story by a Negro, about Negroes, set in a predominantly Negro environment; and yet it is not essentially a "Negro" novel. Herein lies Mr. Baldwin's signal achievement. The plot, related in a series of superbly articulated flash- backs, is not grounded on race relations nor on the sociology of the Negro. The author is not intent on analyzing the social dilemma of certain spe- cific Negro characters, but he is intent on analyzing the spiritual dilemma of certain people who happen, in this instance, to be Negroes. The principal characters in the novel are the Grimeses - Gabriel, the preacher father; Elizabeth, his careworn, sorrow-ridden wife; John, her bastard son; and Florence, Gabriel's unbendingly dignified sister. The plot is concerned with the effects of a highly surcharged emotional religion on the dreams, aspirations, values, and experiences of these characters. And this religion which fills the book and activates the plot is just as important as any character in the book. It is a quintessential, fire-and-brimstone Protestantism - ascetic, sin-laden, emotionally and musically rich, and colorfully anthropomorphic. It is the religion of the unlettered masses in several sections of Protestant America - the religion of the impoverished rural South, and the religion of the slum-ridden urban North. Mr. Baldwin so describes the reactions of his characters to this religion that no one character's reaction ever becomes a socially con- ditioned reaction to a socially conditioned "Negro" religion. The con- flicts which sear the soul of each character are conflicts which are con- cerned with ethical values and patterns of conduct, and these are pre- eminently the concern of religion, whatever the color of a man's skin. Mr. Baldwin never forgets this fact, and this is the great merit of his work. His is essentially a religious novel. Hence, there is no mockery in his description of the almost Dionysian revelry of the "Saints" of the "Temple of the Fire Baptized" - no mockery of their songs and of their wordless religious ecstasy in their storefront church, no mockery of their emotional gyrations before the altar of deliverance. Mr. Baldwin's message to sophisticated, skeptical, utilitarian America is that such a religion is part of the American scene and that it merits quiet acceptance, not patronizing tolerance. Inevitably, in a religious novel, character becomes more important than either plot or setting. This is true of Go Tell It on the Mountain. Although the reader knows that the action takes place either in Harlem 326</page><page sequence="2">THE LITERATURE OF RACE AND CULTURE or in the deep South, the setting is never particularized to any great extent. The author quite justifiably concentrates on character analysis- through introspective flashbacks, through passages of sharply authentic dialogue, and through his own objective comments. The crowning point of the novel undoubtedly is John Grimes' mystical experience on his fourteenth birthday. This incident occurs after the reader has been given a full account of the life and experiences of the other three principal characters - Gabriel and Elizabeth Grimes, and John's Aunt Florence. Their past lives, seen in retrospect, have been filled with sin, cruelty, deceit, and hypocrisy; but John's mystical experience, described in a powerfully poetic prose, furnishes a beautiful climax to the action of the novel. When John Grimes sees the Lord and envisions the marriage of light and darkness, the misery and folly of his elders are forgotten. The storm of their lives is over, and the reader sees the blue sky of the young man's mystical affirmation. James Baldwin, I repeat, has written a very fine first novel. Richard K. Barksdale North Carolina College at Durham KISSES OF DEFEAT AND DEATH THE VIOLENT WEDDING. By Robert Lowry. Garden City, N. Y.: Doubleday &amp; Co., 1953. 255 pp. $3.00. WATCH NIGHT. By Walter B. Lowrey. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1953. 269 pp. $3.50. The discriminating reader will wish to avoid the natural tendency to confuse these novels and their authors with one another. Both treat of an affair - more of the flesh than the spirit - between a colored man and a white woman, but Robert Lowry's The Violent Wedding is a surface rendition in much the manner of Mickey Spillane, while Walter B. Low- rey's Watch Night is a serious undertaking and a noteworthy achievement. The Violent Wedding concerns a lithe Negro middleweight, too ob- viously drawn from life, and the white artist who picks him up at a time when she is at loose ends emotionally and professionally. Laine Brendan tires of Baby James, as she has tired of other men she has picked up, just when his casual interest turns into a compelling need. She rejects him, as she has rejected most other things, and finds release from her un- welcome pregnancy and her quite pointless life in an overdose of sleeping tablets. Floored but not knocked out, Baby goes on to win the champion- ship. Lowry's sparse prose style seems to spring as much from naivete as from a decision to follow a vogue. (Why, in this enlightened age, he insists on "Chinamen" instead of Chinese and affects "negro" without the initial capital is hard to guess.) As in his earlier Find Me in Fire, his rendition of motivation is frequently inadequate. 327</page></plain_text>
