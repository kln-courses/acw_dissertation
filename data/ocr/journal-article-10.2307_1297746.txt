Brower, 3: 212 AN EDITOR REMINISCES More than a few times we encountered substandard manuscripts that bore the name of a distinguished professor as coauthor. We could only surmise that the professor was in the habit of sticking his name on everything that came under his jurisdiction and that he had had little or nothing else to do with the dubious manuscript. To my way of thinking this is a questionable policy at best. In other cases a young author would state, under acknowledgments, that he thanked the eminent Professor Boondogle for "critical reading of the manuscript," when it was obvious that Professor Boondogle had either never bothered to look at it, or that he had lapsed into hopeless senility. Excerpted from "An Editor Reminisces" by Norman H. Boke, University of Oklahoma, on his retirement as editor of the American Journal of Botany.
