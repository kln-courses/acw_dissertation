The building, 24 m in diameter, had f been erected on a 2-m base, as were the for tress walls. The outer walls were punctuated by arrow-shaped loopholes, and on the north a massive oval entrance was adjoined by a tower. Inside the temple, a series of walls divided it into segmental rooms surrounding a central rec tangular hall. During the last phase of construc tion, after the fire, a wall divided the hall into two rooms. (A similar contemporary building, better preserved, was excavated at the Giaur 3 settlement, which is also situated in left-bank Khwarazm, about 60 km southwest of Kalali gir 2.) Access to the round temple apparently was restricted to a limited circle of people, since it was reached through a system of narrow pas sages leading to a small formal eyvan. The eyvan and adjacent rooms differed from the others in that they contained animal bones. The rooms also contained tandour-type hearths used to bake bread, indicating that ritual feasts might have taken place there. Approximately forty rooms surrounding the ν / round building, probably used for temple house keeping and ritual storage, were uncovered. At the foot of the walls of the building, west of the entrance tower, a passage was formed by a string of narrow, corridor-like rooms into which doors from a second row of rooms, situated along the fortress wall, opened. Economizing on space and building materials resulted in the wide use of frame construction, even in this section of the sibly it was designed for the preparation of ritual complex.
