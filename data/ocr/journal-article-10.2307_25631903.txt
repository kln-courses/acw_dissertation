<plain_text><page sequence="1">The ALA Choices OUTSTANDING REFERENCE SOURCES: A 1990 selection of recent titles A compilation of distinguished reference works selected by the Reference Sources Committee of the ALA Reference and Adult Services Division edited by Sarah B. Watstein THE PLETHORA OF REFER ence sources examined yearly by reference librarians results, inevi tably and increasingly, in frustra tion. Compilers of these sources all believe they can make a difference! Distinguishing titles from their re spective complements, if any, re quires that reference librarians review the source's authority, scope, utility, and format. Distin guishing one competing title from another also requires asking several questions. Which sources fill bib liographic gaps in our reference collections? Which sources really break new ground? Which sources are truly unique? How expertly does the book in one's hand fulfill its purpose and meet its goal? The Reference Sources Commit tee hereby goes on record to say that reference publishing is indeed alive and well. Members examined approximately 800 titles in their as signed areas. Identifying trends in reference publishing is a bit like Lewis Car roll's description of hunting the snark?both endeavors lead to fu tility and near insanity. Steadying oneself among the dizzying array of choices to satisfy the require ments of users who need to consult reference resources, one might identify trends by the number of recently published reference tools for literary criti cism, by the range of new and unusual at lases, by the dazzling selection of sports resources, or the continuing output of ref erence books on the Bible. Taking a deep breath, one might also identify trends by children, sages, and gray-haired philosophers?all of whom are far better employed making mud-pies. The remainder of this article focuses on sorting out those outstanding reference sources that best serve the needs of our us ers, be they general readers in small and medium-sized public libraries or students, faculty, and staff in small and medium-sized academic li braries. Selection criteria The committee's Policy and Pro cedure Manual governs both the work of the committee and the preparation of the annual list of outstanding reference sources. A section of this Manual, "Selection Criteria for the RASD Reference Sources Committee," provides for including both print and nonprint reference sources, such as micro forms, online databases, and opti cal media. The "Selection Criteria" address the conventional definition of a ref erence source?stated in part as "usually comprehensive in scope, condensed in treatment, and ar ranged on some special plan to fa cilitate the ready and accurate finding of information... "*?and the audience for whom the list is prepared. The criteria provide guidelines for when to include an nuals, yearbooks, new printings of Essays, photos, and charts punctuate this dictionary of en tries on the ailing environment. Sarah B. Watstein is an associate professor and acting chief librarian at Hunter College, CUNY Library. Prior to assuming the "acting" post, she headed the library's reference divi sion. Watstein's publications include, with Mar tin Kesselman, End-User Searching in Libraries (American Library Association, 1988) and the forthcoming Women and AIDS; A Sourcebook Documenting the Undocumented (Oryx, 1990). the large number of recently published ref erence books on a particular topic such as AIDS; drugs, alcohol and addictions; fax; rock and roll; women; and Vietnam. One can only wonder if there is reason behind the fact that a rash of similar reference books appears in the same year. Perhaps it is best to leave the hunting of the snark to encyclopedias, new editions, new volumes of incomplete sets whose publication be gan in earlier years, and spin-offs. The "Se lection Criteria" also provide guidelines for *From Isadore Gilbert Mudge's introduc tion to the 6th edition of Guide to Reference Books (American Library Association, 1936).

Notable omissions Notable titles that have been omitted fall into three categories, as follows. First, some important recent titles have been omitted from the 1990 list because they are new editions of old standards. Ex amples of such "new" "old chestnuts" in clude: The Broadcast Communications Dictionary, 3d ed.; the Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock and Soul; the 9th edition of The Co lumbia Granger's Index to Poetry; The Great Song Thesaurus, 2d ed.; the 9th edition of Halliweirs Filmgoer's Companion; Hand book of American Popular Culture; McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms, 4th ed.; The New Every man Dictionary of Music, the Oxford Com panion to Classical Literature, 2d ed.; Roget's II: The New Thesaurus; and the 13th edition of The Readers Advisor. Second, long-standing reference sources that have proven their utility in our refer ence departments and that have changed significantly or benefited from admirable updating include: The Canadian Encyclope dia, 2d ed.; the Continuum Dictionary of Women's Biography; Music Reference and Research Materials: An Annotated Bibliogra phy, 4th ed.; The New Electronic Encyclope dia; and Ulrich's International Periodicals Directory, 1988-89: Now Including Irregular Serials &amp; Annuals. Third, several recent titles whose publi cation marks the continuation or com pletion of a major set also warrant recognition. Examples include: American Historical Images on File; Dictionary of American Biography: Supplement Eight, 1966-1970; the Dictionary of the Middle Ages, v. 12; Encyclopedia of American Busi ness History and Biography: Railroads in the Nineteenth Century; European Writers: The Twentieth Century, v. 8-9; Find That Tune: An Index to Rock, Folk-Rock, Disco &amp; Soul in Collections, v. 2; The Historical Atlas of Political Parties in the United States Con gress, 1789-1989; Oxford Illustrated Encyclo pedia, volumes 3 and 4: and Population Information in Twentieth Century Census Volumes: 1950-1980. As a final prefatory remark to the 1990 list, it is important to note several sources that promise to be major research tools. Examples include: Cities of the United States; Compton's Multimedia Encyclope dia; the Magill Survey of Science series (The Space Exploration Series is currently avail able); Opera Annual: U.S. 1984-85; and Pe 412 AMERICAN LIBRARIES MAY 1990</page><page sequence="3">nodical Source Index, 1847-1985 (only v. 1-4 are available to date). A profile of 19901s list The 1990 list is almost equally strong in culture and civilization, humanities and the arts, and sciences and medicine. General works and titles in the social sciences are less strong, but only slightly so. The 36-title 1990 list is 10 titles larger than each of the previous two years. The committee believes these selections constitute essential additions for small and medium-sized public or aca demic libraries. Twenty-one nonprint refer ence sources were seriously con sidered. None, however, met the committee's three requirements: fulfilling criteria used to select sources for inclusion in the an nual list; general availability to small and medium-sized public and academic libraries; and unique availability in nonprint format or accessibility to infor mation otherwise unavailable. The 1990 list does not include any microforms, online data bases, or optical media. The 1990 list includes 15 titles from 1989 and 21 titles from 1988. The "Selection Criteria" advise that items included should have been published in the year under consideration, while nonetheless recognizing that items from the previous year can be treated in subse quent lists. Our criteria allow the list to be timely, to reflect publishing realities and id iosyncracies, and to complement commit tee work flow and deadlines.

General Reference Books for Adults: Au thoritative Evaluations of Encyclopedias, At lases, and Dictionaries, edited by Marion Sader, 614p. New York: R.R. Bowker, 1988 (0-8352-2393-0), $69.95. General Reference Books for Adults serves to give lengthy authoritative evalua tions of over 200 important reference sources from such classics as the Encyclo paedia Britannica to some of the new CD ROM products on the market. Sources are arranged into four categories: encyclope dias, world atlases, dictionaries, and word books. More is attempted here than a mere linear evaluation: a general introduction serves to provide a history of reference books; and essays introducing the various types of reference sources provide an over view of each genre, with useful pointers on weighing the advantages and disadvantages of similar sources. Sections are consistently organized, facilitating comparison between like sources. The inclusion of facsimile pages and statistical data help gives author ity to the descriptive commentary. This is a well-planned book and will serve not only those librarians who are interested in devel oping their own collections but also indi viduals who need advice on which sources are best for their personal needs. This is recommended as a superb collection build ing tool. International Encyclopedia of Communica tions, 4 vols., editor-in-chief Erik Barnow. l,913p. Oxford and New York: Oxford Uni versisty Press, 1989 (0-19-504994-2 set), $350. This four-volume set is indispensable for all reference collections embracing the field of communications science. Over six years in the making, this combined effort of hundreds of international scholars is not only one of the most significant publica tions of the year, it is also one of the most attractive. Beautifully printed, artistically designed, and superbly illustrated, this au thoritative encyclopedia offers in-depth analyses of all aspects of communication from advertising and politics to folklore and theater. It seeks to bring to light what is meant by the term "communications revolution" by giving emphasis to the inter play between human communication and human society throughout history. The ap proximately 500 signed articles are ar ranged alphabetically; a select bibliography of significant studies follows each article. Cross references are prevalent. A solid in dex and a separate topical guide improve the overall usefulness of the set. The Inter national Encyclopedia of Communications is truly a magnificent work. The Sports Address Book, edited by Scott Callis, 294p. New York: Pocket, 1988 (0 671-64771-7), $6.95, pap. Do you want to write to your favorite tennis star?

This source is essential for most academic, public, and school libraries. Walter Breens Complete Encyclopedia of 414 AMERICAN LIBRARIES MAY 1990</page><page sequence="5">U.S. and Colonial Coins, by Walter Breen. 754p. New York: Doubleday, 1988 (0-385 14207-2), $75. Breen is considered the foremost U.S. coin historian. His new encyclopedia will undoubtedly become the foremost refer ence work on U.S. and colonial coins. It provides exhaustive coverage (over 7,800 entries) of American coins, from 1616 to the modern day. For each coin, the author gives mint, designer, physical specifications and grading standards, as well as historical circumstances of issue and level of rarity, if applicable. He does not generally give price information as prices change rapidly, but he does occasionally give an auction price. The reproductions are excellent and sources are given for each. Introductory es says precede each chapter. A glossary at the end of the work explains terms and is followed by an extensive bibliography and explanation of abbreviations and typo graphic conventions. Two indexes, names and subjects, provide access. This encyclo pedia is a remarkable reference source and certain to become a classic. Science and Medicine The American Medical Association Encyclope dia of Medicine, edited by Charles B. Clay man. l,184p. New York: Random House, 1989 (0-394-56528), $39.95. An up-to-date, auth oritative medical guide is essential for every li brary, and this new dic tionary of diseases, symptoms, procedures, and medications is ap propriate for both the layperson and the stu dent. The more than 5,000 alphabetically ar ranged entries vary in length from one line to three pages and are ac companied by over 2,200 two-color illus trations. A thorough index and good cross references make this an easy-to-use guide for quick medical explana tions. The reasonable price should make it attractive to libraries everywhere. American Nursing: A Biographical Dictio nary, edited by Vern L. Bullough, Olga Maranjian Church, and Alice P. Stein. 358p. New York: Garland, 1988 (0-8240 8540-X), $60. One of the first biographical guides to the nursing profession, this volume pro vides much-needed historical information about 177 nurses, most born before 1890. Each subject is described in a formalized two-page signed entry, noting contribu tions to the profession, personal history, and a bibliography if applicable. Because the essays reveal something of what it was like to be a working woman during the rapid social changes of the time, American Nursing will be of interest not only to the nursing profession, but also to historians of labor, women, science, and medicine. Astnovs Chronology of Science and Discov ery, by Isaac Asimov. 768p. New York: Harper and Row, 1989 (006015612-0), $29.95. A number of excellent chronologies have been published recently in the science field. Asimov's offers an important twist: Along with accurate accessible information on landmark scientific events, the author has placed these achievements in the con text of concurrent social, political, and cul tural events. Included in an "In Addition" section at the end of each year's entry or entries, this information enhances the re searcher's understanding of a particular scientific breakthrough, demonstrating not only the positive effects the advance or dis covery had on our world but the reverse as well. Also included is a quick reference timetable of over 4,000 years of discovery and an excellent index. Eminently readable prose, ease of use, and proper placing of an event in historical context add up to a much-used reference source for both stu dents and library staff. Atlas of Dog Breeds of the World, by Bon nie Wilcox and Chris Walkowicz. 912p. Neptune City, N.J.: T.F.H. Publications, 1989 (0-86622-930-2), $100. A dog-lover's delight, this is an impres sive compilation of the history and devel opment of some 400 breeds of dog, whether recognized by the American Ken nel Club or not. Lengthy descriptions note each breed's personality, size, coat type, and origin in a breezy, informal style. Ref erence librarians will appreciate the inclu sion of many obscure breeds, and the excellent, large-color photographs of both puppies and adult dogs, sometimes several of a single breed. This is a wonderful vol ume which will prove immediately useful to reference librarians and will encourage browsing by just about everyone. A Dictionary of Ethology, by Klaus Immel mann and Colin Beer. 336p. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1989 (0 674-20506-5), $35. Ethology, the scientific study of animal behavior, is a relatively young discipline. However, it has al ready developed a vast array of technical terms which, if worth while synthesis is to take place, need pre cise and explicit defi nition. A Dictionary of Ethology by Klaus Immelmann and Colin Beer is designed with this purpose in mind. Based on three predecessor volumes written in German by Immelmann alone, this new English language dictionary is both larger and more comprehensive than the previous versions. Over 600 terms are ar ranged alphabetically and supplied with nu merous cross refer ences. Terms range from the familiar "imprinting" to the more technical "indi MRI scanners provide a three-dimensional image such as the damaged shoulder joint pic tured in The American Medical Association Encyclopedia of Medicine (Random House).

Just what is that strange-looking red, white, and black fish with yellow spots swimming about in your marine aquar ium? At long last, the salt-water equivalent to Dr. Axelrods Atlas of Freshwater Fishes is here to provide the answer. This welcome addition to both reference and circulating shelves is designed as a pictorial aid to fish identification. Included are over 4,000 photographs, 560 colorplates, and an aquaristic section on marine fish aquarium maintenance. Drs.

This handbook examines the major ecological issues, in each case explaining the problem and what could be?and what is being? done. The major part of the book is a dic tionary of entries on everything environmental from "acceptable daily in take (ADI)" to "zero population growth." Well-written and easily understandable, the articles are enhanced by excellent charts and graphs and cross-references. In addi tion, six essays discuss more thoroughly such important concerns as drinking water, acid rain, and James Lovelock's theory of earth as Gaia, a living system.

New Amsterdam Books, 1988 (0 0941533-40-9), $35. Short entries on terms used in the the ater, not on the dramatists and their plays. The topics covered range from costumes and character types to varieties of stages (thrust), technical stage terms (ghost glide), acting terms, dramatic structure, forms of drama, and the ideas of important theo rists (the magic if).

Ganzl s Book of Musical Theatre, by Kurt Ganzl and Andrew Lamb. l,353p. New York: Schir mer, 1989 (0-02-871941-7), $75. Ganzl does for operetta, comic opera, and musicals what Kobbe (1987) does for operas. Detailed synopses of plot (including place ment of songs) follow details of first productions and a list of characters. Entries are arranged by country (Great Britain, France, United States, Austria Germany-Hungary, Spain) and then chronologically. An essay on the history of musical theater in each geographic area opens each section. The time period covered spans "The Beggar's Opera" (1728) to "The Phantom of the Opera" (1987). Each musical fits one of these criteria: is likely to be produced, is of historical sig nificance, or is a favorite of the authors (and deserving of more recognition). Pictures from pro ductions add interest, and a selec tive discography and indexes of titles, authors, composers, lyri cists, and of song titles increase the reference value. Ganzl supple ments and updates two light op era books from 1962 (Lubbock and Ewen). New Grove Dictionary of Jazz, 2 vols., edited by Barry Kernfeld, l,400p. New York: Grove's Dic tionaries of Music, 1988 (0 935859-39-X), $350. While narrow in scope, this dictionary is broad in its ap proach to jazz. The two-volume set contains 4,500 entries. Most of these entries are biographies of iazz performers, composers, and arrangers. The remaining entries cover styles and periods of jazz, definitions of terms (often illustrated by musical nota tion), theory, instruments, films, record la bels, jazz clubs, and festivals. An extensive bibliography and discography add to the value of this definitive work. Grove's, long distinguished for music reference works, has successfully produced an academic study of an enduring component of the music world.
