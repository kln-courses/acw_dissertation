<plain_text><page sequence="1">Henry J. C. Gibson. Dundee Royal Infirmary, 1798-1948. The Story of the Old Infirmary with a Short Account of More Recent Years. Dundee: William Kidd &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1949. 71 pp. 111. A voluntary dispensary was first organised in Dundee in 1735 - but nothing remains to be remembered of this service, until 1782 when a fresh subscription was opened. It was in this year that medical attendants were re-appointed by a dis- pensary committee to visit the sick poor in their own homes. This committee 1 In the Introduction, Professor Meyer-Abich contrasts the static science of antiquity with the dynamic mechanics of the 16th- 17th centuries and tries to show Goethe's synthesis of these two approaches, a synthesis which he considers significant for modern biology. These typological schemes seem somewhat forced. For instance: What is the criterium for the " true " Greeks (pp. 12 f. and 19) ? How can Goethe represent a dynamic renaissance of ancient science " (p. 34) if lack of dynamics is supposed to be one of the main characteristics of ancient science? 3 For instance: ". . . alle künftige Naturwissenschaft wird von Ganzheiten handeln und dadurch holistisch sein oder sie wird überhaupt nicht sein" (p. 36). Is the "rein plastische Freude (of the " Bildungstrieb ") am Gestalten und Umgestalten, ohne deren Wirksamkeit die Mannigfaltigkeit der organismischen Natur bestimmt (sie!) nicht verständlich sein könnte" (p. 293) more than an anthropomorphism? In fairness to the author it has, however, to be said that for more detailed discussion of łifs views he refers to his book, Naturphilosophie auf neuen Wegen, Stuttgart, 1948, Hippokrates- Verlag.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 403 merged in 1793 with the Infirmary committee, when the latter was engaged in drawing up a constitution for a hospital and - unsuccessfully - persuading the Town Council to present a site. The final result was a two-storey building offer- ing accommodation for 56 patients. There is some interesting detail about the nursing staff, the three forms of diet, expenditure and the attending medical staff (for practical purposes almost entirely, until 1836, consisting of surgeons). The report for 1841/42 shows out of 401 patients 323 cured, 40 relieved, 7 continuing as out-patients and 8 dead, with an average stay at hospital of 30 days. The number of operations performed was 49, including removal of cancerous growth in various regions and amputations of leg, thigh, and forearm - with not a single fatal issue. In this connection the help and encouragement given by James Syme to the staff at Dundee Infirmary should be remembered. The report for 1847/48 reflects the problems which fevers presented to the hospital authorities - necessitating expansion. Out of a total of 3697 patients treated, there were 1264 with "Typhus" (fatal in 205 cases) and 1840 with " Epidemic Fever " (with 30 deaths) as against 234 medical and 296 surgical cases. A much heavier toll was exacted by cholera (1832 and 1849) - 173 dying out of 304 admitted as in-patients. Even after the new infirmary was opened in 1855, fever patients were distributed through the common wards with tragic effects from time to time, as in the year 1863-64, when three successive medical superintendents and a matron died of typhus fever. The well illustrated book (containing portraits of Dr. John Crichton, the lithotomist, 1772- 1860; presidents, benefactors, and staff past and present) is full of factual and parochial information. This will prove one of the many invaluable sources for the general medical historian and encourage an attempt at integrating it with the economic, sociological, and medical standards of the late XVIIIth and XlXth centuries.
