<plain_text><page sequence="1">C.B. Muthamma The right to be different The Indian mental and spiritual make-up is akin to a great virgin forest, where everything belongs and in which the concept of a weed, as a redundant species, would be incon gruous. India can, arguably, claim that it has every racial type in the world and every religion as well. It also has an enormous diversity of languages, cultures and ethnicities, in addition to categories like caste and tribe. All these have co-existed for centuries, with an instinctive philosophy of live and let-live, accepting diversity as the natural order of things. There have been aberrations, of course, to be expected in a history stretching over centuries and millennia, and where large num bers of people are involved. But the mainstream of India's conscious ness is a belief which, moreover, has been put into practice, that diversity is normal, uniformity is not. The world does not have only one kind of tree or one kind of animal, or indeed one form of life or non-life. It is not logical that human beings should be of only one race or colour or religion or philosophy. If that is so, it is equally illogical to hold it against someone that they are different from oneself in any of these respects. In our own times, the Indian Constitution declares that there shall be no dis crimination against any citizen on the grounds of race, colour, caste, creed, sex, or whatever else. It came naturally to the makers of the Constitution to put this in, given the traditions of this country. It is often said that Hinduism has a long history of tolerance. This is misleading on two counts. To begin with, 'Hinduism' is a label given by outsiders to the entire range of beliefs and philosophy of the subcon 97</page><page sequence="2">98 / India International Centre Quarterly tinent and its way of life, particularly its Dharma, a comprehensive term which has no equivalent in English, and is not translatable as religion. It is only a non-Indian who can wonder whether Gandhiji was a religious person who strayed into politics or a politician who was religious. In the Indian tradition there is no contradiction. There was, naturally, no divide between religious and secular life. But the term Hinduism has been used as equivalent to a religious belief. It was, however, never a single set of beliefs or a credo. It was not founded by any single thinker. It was the cumulative wisdom of an entire people, and its generations of thinkers and sages, exploring the intellectual, spiritual and material world without constraint. Even in our own times, a person bearing the 'Hindu' label has little difficulty in going to the places of worship of other religions. A Hindu can be a theist, a monotheist, a polytheist, or an atheist. He believes what he personally finds capable of believing. The concept of heresy did not exist. It was, and is, a no-holds-barred intellectual and spiritual search for ultimate truth. It is not laid down that a seeker should go to the temple or even pray. The priests are not entitled to tell a person what to believe. They only perform given rituals on request, and get paid for the service. Given this background, the notion of 'tolerance' too is misleading. Tolerance implies a stance, in which one sees oneself as the norm, and judges others according to that norm, reserving the right to accept or reject them. But that is not the case here. In the Indian tradition of acceptance of diversity, the essential motive force is inclusiveness, not exclusiveness. This inclusiveness transcends human boundaries, seeing humanity not as above and outside the rest of creation, but as part of and integral to it, and as having no existence separate from it. The rest of creation was not perceived as having been put there for the benefit of mankind, to be conquered, subjugated and exploited. The Indian world-view has a deep reverence for nature and sees everything as being imbued with divinity Birds and beasts were held sacred to this or that deity and until recently, it would have been difficult to per suade a farmer to willingly kill a monkey or a rat on the grounds that they were a threat to his crops. To him the monkey was Hanuman, and the rat was the vaahana that carried Lord Ganesha. And Ganesha himself had an elephant head. Deities were depicted in many non human forms and divinity was not constrained to anthropomorphic</page><page sequence="3">C.B. Muthamma / 99 manifestations only. Trees and plants, rivers and mountains, are also sacred in themselves or in association to a deity. Some modern en vironmentalists argued for conservation in terms of the benefit or loss—usually economic—to the human being. Not all see human and non-human entities in creation as being bound together by a sense of an intangible parallel world, where divisions are impossible—a sense, one could say, of spiritual ecology. Modern environmentalism has a long way to go to reach that state of deep belief where the human being identifies with the rest of the universe. To see life primarily in anthropocentric terms is a limiting factor. In this world-view, everything is up for conquest and exploitation, and possibly for destruction. It is a self-defeating philosophy, and unvi able. Awareness of consequences is growing today even as we begin to see signs of extinction of living species and the irreversible destruc tion of resources. As corrollary to this creed it follows that not only is nature fair game for conquest and exploitation but also is the Other. This Other can be other countries, or other peoples, especially those perceived as different from oneself on the count of race, nationality, language, belief and so on. In the Indian tradition and belief, propounded by India's sages (but not necessarily followed by most people), there is only one thing to conquer—the self, the Ego. The world-view of this tradition offered unbounded intellectual and spiritual horizons, and freedom to seek wider and deeper comprehension. One remembers a poem by Rupert Brooke, entitled Heaven. In it, a fish dreams of heaven, which to it is a place with the slimiest slime and the fattest flies, and God is the biggest fish of all. Peoples and cultures that deny diversity as a premise of existence are doomed to a similarly limited vision of life. Monoculture never had a place in India, whether in human, material, cultural, intellectual, or spiritual terms. Therefore, India's democracy is not simply a matter of a written constitution, but essen tially embedded in a way of living and thinking. One not only accepts that the Other is different but accepts his right to be different and positively welcomes the difference. It creates a world which is safe for diversity, the enriching factor that guarantees the sanity of both, individual and society. Communities that have broken off from this mainstream Indian ethos, have difficulty with democracy. Constitu tions can be written, but inclusiveness cannot be brought about by</page><page sequence="4">100 / India International Centre Quarterly legislation. The other face of uniformity is intolerance as the phenomenon of Apartheid has demonstrated. Modern India, however, has a problem today. It seeks to emulate countries that have achieved prosperity through conquest and the industrial civilisation. Their success came from the ability to dominate the world, its peoples and its resources, and this success has been sought to be perpetuated by tireless upgrading of means and methods along a linear notion of progress. Ever-increasing production and ever-growing consumption constitute the norm. Inevitably, the scale of mass-production has also yielded mass-produced human beings— all wearing the same clothes, using the same gadgets, eating the same foods, speaking the same language, thinking the same thoughts, and above all, chasing the same values—the values of consumerism. Within these brave new societies individual human identities, varieties of cultures, rich and beautiful languages with their distinctive ethos and accumulated stores of wisdom, are as much at risk as the flora and fauna that have been weeded out. Would it be possible to reconcile the intangibles that make life meaningful with the material progress which all societies desire? The great industrialist, J.R.D. Tata, was once asked about India becoming a great economic power. Tata's reply was that he did not want India to be a great economic power, but to be a happy country. If India is to save itself, and hopefully, some of the world, from the tyranny of homogenisation it is this precious heritage of diversity that it must preserve—diversity on all planes: human, material, cul tural, intellectual and spiritual; a diversity that is the guarantor of sanity, of humanity and of creativity. □</page></plain_text>
