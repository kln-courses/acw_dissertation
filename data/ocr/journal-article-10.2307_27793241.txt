Sites Explored Sites included in this summary are listed according to the new unitary authority boundaries introduced in 1996. 1. WALES By EVAN M. CHAPMAN CARDIFF (1) Cardiff Castle (ST 1807 7659): (a) a deposit dated to the first half of the second century was revealed during hand excavation for a sign c. 10 m to the south of the north gate of the rebuilt third-century fort, (b) Elements of the Roman west wall were recorded during repairs to the Ladies' Walk.1 CARMARTHENSHIRE (1) Llandeilo, Dineftvr Park (SN 607 224): sherds of Roman pottery and tegulae found close to the spring-source of a stream, on the western boundary of the Deer Park, suggested the presence of a substantial Roman building nearby. Geophysical survey of the area identified a variety of potentially significant features, several of which were investigated. Although the site of a possible Roman building was identified, its excavation was hampered by a substantial depth of colluvium and a continuous stream of groundwater. A small investigation below the maximum practical depth of excavation did, however, expose the top of a probable in-situ deposit of Roman-period demolition debris, including charcoal and tegulae fragments. The location of the building, in what would then have been a relatively steep-sided stream valley, is unusual, and may suggest that the building was located at the stream source specifically for ritual purposes. The Roman pottery assemblage demonstrates that this building was not used at the same time as the nearby Roman fort, but was established soon after the fort's closure in the second century and continued in use into the third/fourth centuries. The building is clearly, therefore, not a bath house associated with the fort.2 GWYNEDD (1) Gwanas-fawr (SH 7711 1645): aerial photography discovered a rectangular earthwork (NPRN 406840) 4.5 km south-east of Dolgellau. Initially thought to be an early fort, the earthwork has now been tested by ground survey, magnetometry and trial excavation, both in the interior and across the inner bank on the east side, and found to be a Roman camp (fig. 2). The enclosure is rectangular in shape, with rounded corners, enclosing an internal area of 1.74 ha (141 m east-west by 124 m north-south). It is defined by a double bank with a median ditch and has four entrances ? those on the east and west centrally-placed and those on the north and south slightly to the west of centre, indicating that the camp faced west. The inner bank was c. 3.5 m wide with an inner and outer turf revetment and a mixed infill of soil, stone and dumped turfs. Although not examined, the outer bank is of slighter character and appears to be a counterscarp. Along the western side, the rampart only partly survives along the line of a recently 1 Excavation by Mr R. Dunning, recording of wall by Ms A.

(Crown Copyright RCAHMW) dug drainage ditch, bounded by a former hedge bank and a recent plantation of deciduous trees. The northern rampart and north-east angle of the site have been lost to cultivation and were only confirmed by magnetometry; a steep scarp edge about 20 m into this field suggests the former position of the destroyed rampart. The fact that the magnetometry survey failed to provide any proof of permanent internal structures, and that the enclosure is defined by a much slighter rampart than that of an auxiliary fort, suggests the site is most* likely to have been a small temporary camp, probably dating to the period of the Flavian conquest in the A.D. 70s; however,</page><page sequence="4">222 ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2008 the surviving entrance gaps show no sign of the characteristic devices for protecting the gates, namely a clavicula or a titulum? MONMOUTHSHIRE (1) Caerwent (Venta Silurum) (ST 469 905): geophysical surveys within and outside the walls of Caerwent. (a) Magnetometry and resistivity across the north-eastern part of the walled area extended over almost 2 ha, covering most of Insulae II, IV and V. The results revealed all of the buildings known from the excavations at the beginning of the twentieth century, including the elliptical 'amphitheatre', and confirmed that the areas in between these structures appear to be free of masonry buildings. The survey showed, however, that the orientation of the town grid differs slightly from the published plan, presumably a consequence of an original surveying or drafting error, (b) A second survey was conducted beyond the West Gate. Here, an area of c. 3 ha, from the main road southwards to beyond the Nedern Brook, was surveyed using magnetometry alone. The results revealed extensive activity extending c. 140 m away from the line of the road, including a regular arrangement of ditched enclosures, possible masonry buildings and areas of burning.4 NEWPORT (1) Caerleon (Isca): (a) Priory Field (ST 33930 90410): excavations were conducted on the site of a large courtyard building, provisionally identified as a horreum, or warehouse, on the dextral side of the praetentura at the front of the fortress.5 The 25 m by 20 m trench was positioned over the southern half of the building's western front range, including its main entrance from the open yard area between it and the three large military granaries close to the porta princip?lis dextra. The excavations revealed the remains of the building's external walls, all of which had been robbed down to their foundations. The lower courses of three internal walls, that divided this side of the building into equal-sized rooms, were also located, as were the latest flagstone floors of two of these rooms. The final surface of the main entrance also consisted of flagstones, possibly reused from the internal courtyard; these were laid after some major structural alterations to this part of the building. At least two buildings were constructed over the remains of the demolished or collapsed military building and the yard immediately in front of it. Drystone or earth-bonded walls without foundations had been built directly on top of the undulating pre-existing surfaces to form narrow rectangular buildings, apparently built up against the front wall of the earlier warehouse. The remnants of a poorly-constructed opus signinum surface in one of these buildings supports a late Roman date for their construction. These Roman or post-Roman phases were sealed by buildings and other features that indicate the agricultural nature of occupation in this part of Caerleon in the medieval period. Roman ceramic material was predominantly late, with the majority belonging to the period between the late third and mid-fourth centuries. The coin assemblage includes numerous Constantinian types and closes with issues of the House of Valentinian.6 3 First recognised from the air by B. Jones, a pilot from Welshpool Airport, and photographed by T. Driver of RCAHMW. Earthwork survey of the above-ground remains by RCAHMW; geophysical survey by D.

The site is across the River Usk from Caerleon, in an area rich in Roman remains, especially burials and cremations. Three trial-trenches were excavated in the footprint of the proposed new development and one small trench against the street frontage. The Roman archaeology in these trenches consisted of the remains of a stone building which was partly robbed during the medieval period, some roughly constructed drains and associated coarse paving. The Roman pottery covered a wide date range from the second to the fourth century but no close dating for any of the contexts was obtained. The drains are important for the materials used in their construction: the fragments of at least two ceramic altar bases and two or more ceramic sacrificial altar tables (mensae).1 A group of bones was found in the shallow fill below a large curved capstone of the drain. All the bones were of sheep, or goat, and comprised a partly scorched and fragmented skull, three juvenile lower mandibles, two older upper mandibles, and a fragment of a goat horn-core. This group was probably in position when the large capstone was put in place. Another trench revealed the only building remains found on the site: two walls, associated with a Roman occupation context, but which had been robbed during the fourteenth century or later.8 (c) Bulmore Road (ST 5650 9136): excavations and a watching-brief conducted during drainage improvements. To the east of Great Bulmore, excavation identified substantial boundary walls of the early second century; on the south side of this enclosure was a small stone shrine overlying a grave containing a stone burial cist. A stone surface, a wall and a furnace were recorded during a watching-brief beneath the modern road. The structures had fallen into disrepair by the mid second century and stone was taken to be reused elsewhere. The watching-brief also recorded a sequence of Roman and later road construction layers within Great Bulmore. Adjacent excavations demonstrated that a sequence of Roman buildings fronted the road on the north side from the early to mid-second century. Initially there was a timber building with evidence for frequent floor repairs. It was severely affected by fire and the foundation was subsequently replaced in stone. The building had been demolished by the mid-third century and no later Roman evidence was present.9 POWYS (1) Llwyn y Brain, Caersws 1 (SO 041 926): geophysical survey within the fort (fig. 3).10 The post-holes of the East Gate show it to be twin-portalled with flanking six-post towers. Within the fort, drains and foundation trenches for timber buildings are defined by some very weak anomalies. Strong thermoremnant responses represent ovens, hearths and probably pits, particularly in the praetentura. To the west of the South Gate and to the rear of the rampart on the south and north, the strong responses plausibly represent burning upon the decommissioning of the fort. The via praetoria, via princip?lis and via decumana are defined by drains ? the via praetoria deviating somewhat from the axis of the fort. Little can be resolved within the latera praetorii other than the faint outlines of the principia, measuring c. 35 m by 30 m. To its south, linear features, probably of more than one phase, define elements of a building, or buildings, which appears not to be a granary. 7 Reported on in Britannia 39 (2008), 266-72. 8 Work by S.

Caersws 1 (Llwyn y Brain): gradiometer survey - grey-scale plot. (Survey by D. Hopewell, R. Hankinson andJ. Burman) In the northern division of the praetentura, close to the via praetoria, are traces of a probable barrack, 8-10 m wide, and possibly 60 m long, arranged per strigas. However, there are also traces of a building with at least four room divisions fronting the via princip?lis which would necessarily reduce its length to c. 54 m. The southern portion of the praetentura shows faint traces of three buildings, at least one of which may be interpreted as a barrack. In the northern division of the retentura there are faint traces of rectangular buildings. To the west of the via quintana are two buildings, 10 m wide and at least 20 m long, seemingly aligned per scamna. In the north-west corner are traces of at least three other buildings and what appear to be two rows of ovens (or kilns) running parallel to the defences. The large number of thermoremnant responses in this area seems to be typical of industrial areas, possibly indicative of a later re-use of this part of the fort. In the southern portion of the retentura there are hints of a building aligned per scamna, with a row of hearths or pits defining its frontage, or that of another building flanking the via quintana}1 SWANSEA ( 1 ) Penmaen, Church Hill (SS 536 898): trial excavation and topographic survey was undertaken 11 Survey, commissioned by Dr J.L.

Davies sent information.</page><page sequence="7">f. hunter 225 on this sub-circular enclosure associated with Roman pottery and tile. The section through the bank showed that it incorporated Roman pottery and tile in its make-up, but its form suggests that it is more likely to have been early medieval. In the area to the south of the enclosure a wall of coursed rubble was revealed, with a cobbled surface on its west side. The wall appears to have been inserted into a layer of rubble, and there were traces of a possible wall underlying the cobbled surface. Traces of a cobbled surface were also found within the enclosure. The pottery suggests that the main period of occupation was in the second century, with slight indications of third/fourth-century activity. The general utilitarian nature of the pottery assemblage and the paucity of metal finds are at variance with the building materials recovered from the site, which include box-tiles, opus signinum, painted plaster and tesserae.12 vale of glamorgan (1) Sully: two coin hoards, buried in pottery vessels c. 3 m apart, were found by metal detection in pasture ? buried in pits cut into the subsoil, with no other obvious archaeological context. Hoard 1, in a local greyware jar: 490 radiates and 1,876 nummi, terminus post quern a.d. 318. Hoard 2, in a Black Burnished ware jar: 14 radiates and 3,534 nummi, terminus post quern a.d. 319-320.13 2. SCOTLAND By FRASER HUNTER NORTH OF THE ANTONINE WALL moray (1) Clarkly Hill (NJ 13 67): two scattered coin hoards, one of denarii (ending in the late second century) and one of sestertii and dupondii (the latest coin so far being of Antoninus Pius), were recovered by metal-detecting.14 Limited excavation points to an Iron Age settlement site; other finds include Roman brooches15 and a range of indigenous material culture.16 angus (1) Stracathro (NO 617 657): magnetometer survey17 revealed details of the fort and annexe (fig. 4).18 At least two ditches are present on the fort's east side; internal detail is indistinct, but includes much of the street system, lines of anomalies from buildings in the retentura, and hints of central-range buildings. The south-west corner is notably magnetically rich, while the annexe shows relatively little sign of activity, although there are some magnetic hotspots. 12 The work, funded by Cadw, was directed by Dr E.M.

The lack of any retentura may imply a non-standard layout, but it has more plausibly been lost to erosion, with the supposed southern rampart being a much later earthwork. (2) Strageath (NN 898 180): geophysical survey21 was extended to the west and south of the fort. Subsequent targeted excavation located the approach road from the west, in good condition; two square flagstones beside it could represent sculpture bases.

This puts the Wall a few metres north of the Ordnance Survey line, matching earlier work in the vicinity.27 north lanarkshire (1) Dullatur, The Lane (NS 7452 7668): evaluations28 in two small areas of the temporary camp29 found no evidence of internal structures. east dunbartonshire (1) Cadder (NS 618 726): small-scale evaluation30 c. 80 m east of the fort, to test whether the bath-house noted in the 1930s31 had survived subsequent poorly-recorded quarrying was inconclusive. No clearly pre-modern levels were located, and oral testament records extensive disturbance in the area. (2) New Kilpatrick (NS 556 723): the two sections of Wall base long exposed in the cemetery were cleaned and recorded in detail.32 (3) Castlehill (NS 525 727): geophysical and topographic survey33 revealed the fort's slightly trapezoidal form, tapering to the south. The east and west gates were located, along with a second ditch north of the Wall to provide additional protection. Some traces of internal features were recovered, but no clear sign of the putative fortlet in the north-west corner.34 Further survey is planned.

The middle was inaccessible, but the caldarium at the west end preserved some stumps of stone pilae. A room to the north is the latrine, with a robbed-out drain (not a later ditch, as previously suspected) running through it. Structural materials include wall plaster, opus signinum, lightweight concrete, and roof tiles (stone and ceramic), while a reused voussoir among the stonework hints at an earlier bath on the site. The latrine had been partly dismantled and reused for iron-working in the Roman period, and the whole structure was heavily robbed in the medieval period, (b) (NT 026 807): field-walking37 over the area of the fort and annexe recovered a range of pottery. CITY OF EDINBURGH (1) Newbridge, 2A Kirkliston Road (NT 1231 7285): excavation38 revealed stretches of cobbled road and associated quarry pits immediately east of the river Almond. The best-preserved stretch, some 6.9 m wide between kerbs, ran east-west; an underlying earlier phase was aligned south west-north-east. An Iron Age pot sherd incorporated in the make-up supports a Roman date.

More limited work in the granary and eastern gateway largely confirmed earlier results, (b) (NT 192 769): magnetometry42 clarified earlier geophysical results,43 supporting the likely annexe ditch line along the raised beach; magnetic anomalies within this area may represent industrial activity. (3) Danderhall, Edmonstone House (NT 3015 6955): evaluation44 located remains of a road running approximately south-east-north-west on a plateau above the current A68 Old Dalkeith Road. It comprised several phases of kerbed cobbled surface, c. 5.0 m wide within shallow flanking ditches. No dating evidence was recovered; it may be a version of or spur from Dere Street, but could be post-Roman.45 MIDLOTHIAN ( 1 ) Glencorse (NT 2332 6271 ): evaluation46 of a possible large fortlet known from cropmarks47 located the truncated remains of a single V-shaped ditch (1-1.8 m wide, up to 0.6 m deep) on three sides, enclosing an area 65 m wide; the fourth side lay outside the development area. Limited trenching in the interior found no structural remains, perhaps due to the evident truncation. There were no finds, but the identification remains feasible. EAST LOTHIAN (1) Inveresk, 3 Smeaton Grove (NT 3495 7150): ditches located in an evaluation48 south-east of the fort are probably further components of the Roman-period field-system known in the area.49 SCOTTISH BORDERS (1) Dun Law, Dere Street (NT 46454 56616): a well-preserved section of Dere Street was excavated50 in advance of road-building. The Roman road was supported on a raft of brushwood to cross a peat-filled palaeochannel; over the deepest area, a regular lattice of thicker branches was used instead. An intermittent gully lay on its east side. Only the foundations (heavy cobbling in sand) of the agger survived, up to 0.5 m thick and 7.5 m wide; the former gravel and sand surface was noted as extensive erosion washes in the surrounding peat. Repairs post-dating erosion of its surface indicate long use; the absence of other road lines suggests this remained the preferred route for centuries.51 41 For previous work on these structures, see A. and V.

ENGLAND 3. HADRIAN'S WALL By PETE WILSON SOUTH TYNESIDE ( 1 ) South Shields fort (Arbeia, NZ 365 679): excavation was completed in the area immediately south of Granaries C15-16. The construction levels of the mid-Antonine (Period 4) fort wall, rampart and intervallum were removed to reveal the pre-fort ground surface.55 This consisted of a grey turf horizon up to 250 mm deep in which occurred a number of circular mounds, up to 1 m in diameter and 0.20 m high. It is not known how these mounds were formed. There was no sign of cultivation in this surface. Presumably it had existed contemporaneously with the pre stone fort, Hadrianic or early Antonine (Period 3), metalled surface (a possible parade-ground?) excavated immediately to the south-east.56 A number of pits and post-holes had been cut through the turf horizon before the construction of the stone fort, but these formed no overall pattern. These were the earliest Roman features on this part of the site. Beneath the turf horizon was a 150 mm-thick layer of orange windblown sand. Below this was encountered cord-rig cultivation, part of the same system encountered 40 m to the south-east and contemporary with, or earlier than, a mid-Iron Age roundhouse excavated there.57 Following the completion of excavation in this area, it is intended to consolidate and display the remains of a third-century barrack (belonging to the larger, third-century fort) which was the best-preserved structure in this area.58 52 Work by A.

A trench east of the Hall uncovered the well-preserved remains of the Roman Military Way. The road was seen to lie slightly north of the line projected on the modern Ordnance Survey map but on a similar alignment, and was formed of smooth but irregularly shaped and sized stone slabs, blocks and cobbles. Although the south flank of the roadway within the trench had been disturbed, the northern edge survived and was formed of substantial kerbstones. To the north a possible roadside gully or ditch was seen, but not excavated as it lay outside the development area. The variability recorded in the four road exposures described above may perhaps be accounted for by factors of erosion and partial resurfacing, the latest occurrences of which may date to the post-Roman period, perhaps as recently as the eighteenth century. The more substantial cobble surfacing recorded at Walwick may have been a response to the sloping topography which would have rendered a less substantial surface vulnerable to slippage, or may be a factor of the greater availability of local raw materials ? in this case perhaps sourced from the nearby river Tyne, or local outcrops.62 (2) Vindolanda (NY 768 663): (a) excavation in Area concentrated on the south-west part of the vicus.63 Two separate phases of Roman activity were examined. In the later second century the area appeared to have had an industrial use. Extensive amounts of burnt material and waste were recovered from at least one timber-framed building, which had also contained several large hearths. The main focus of the excavation was on stone-built features that overlay these workshops, associated with the main vicus of the early third-century stone fort. A network of cobbled roads was identified, one of which led away from the south-west of the site towards 'Kingcairn' hill. A small industrial workshop had flanked the south side of this road, with a potential cemetery situated on its northern side. It is anticipated that work will continue in this area in 2009 to further establish the scale, date range, and number of potential burials. 59 Excavations by The Archaeological Practice Ltd and Alan Williams Archaeology.

A notable feature was the heavy accumulation of coins (over 300) on the via princip?lis on the north side and on stretches of the intervallum roads nearby ? the majority being of mid fourth-century date and later. A comprehensive environmental sampling programme will provide valuable information about the goods once kept in the buildings. Notable finds included two fragments of RIB 1705, the dedication to Caracalla found in the adjacent principia in 1933, and a small fragment of bronze from either a calendar or a water-clock, featuring the month of September.65 CUMBRIA (1) Carlisle, land off Burgh Road (NY 37423 56202): archaeological excavation identified part of a large ditch believed to form the western and southern sides of a rectilinear enclosure, together with a complex of smaller ditches.66 Based on the dimensions of the western and southern sides, it is estimated that the enclosure measured c. 35 m north-south by c. 30 m east-west (externally). The ditch forming the enclosure measured c. 3.6 m in width by up to c. 1.4 m in depth, and had the classic V-shaped profile generally associated with Roman military installations. Most of the interior lay outside the area of investigation. The ditch was of a size and design to have served a defensive function and the enclosed area was similar in size to those associated with watch-towers and smaller fortlets elsewhere in Roman Britain. The location of this site, on a low ridge overlooking the low-lying ground to the north of Hadrian's Wall, would also have been appropriate to such a function. The complex of smaller ditches probably represents evidence of land management dating to the Roman period. The random layout of the ditches suggests that they may not be contemporary.67 (2) Walltown, King Arthur s Well (NY 6806 6664): excavation in advance of footpath work associated with the Hadrian's Wall Path National Trail revealed the remains of a rectangular, stone-built structure immediately adjacent to the south face of the Wall at King Arthur's Well, in the nick close to Walltown Farm (Wall Mile 44). The structure was aligned perpendicular to the Wall, and was approximately 5 m wide and over 5 m long, with a central hearth and walls of unmortared whinstone. Preliminary analysis of the associated pottery indicates a mid- to late second-century date for the entire assemblage; an intaglio was also recovered. Radiocarbon determinations for two samples of burnt animal bone and charcoal from the central hearth are currently awaited.68 (3) Knockupworth Farm (NY 3720 5680): excavations on the line of the Wall were carried out in advance of the construction of a new road bridge over the River Eden (Wall Mile 67). Probable evidence for the Turf Wall, together with remains of the Stone Wall and the Vallum, were recorded. The Turf Wall had been slighted prior to construction of the Stone Wall, which had been built directly on top of its predecessor. The Stone Wall proved to be poorly preserved, for the most part only the rubble core remaining, together with some of the southern facing stones, to a maximum height of two courses. The north face had been completely eroded, and it seems likely that much of the masonry had fallen down the steep river bank in antiquity. The Vallum ditch was largely obscured by the remains of the Carlisle and Silloth Railway. Sections were excavated through the ditch and the north mound, and organic deposits were found towards 65 Mr R. Birley sent information. 66 Work by M. Kiry for CFA Archaeology Ltd. 67 Miss S.

NORTHERN COUNTIES By PETE WILSON NORTHUMBERLAND (1) Knaresdale with Kirkhaugh, Whitley Castle (lEpiacum, NY 6949 4868): detailed landscape survey and geophysical survey of the fort.70 The earthwork analysis and geophysical survey have considerably advanced our understanding of the fort and its surroundings. The location was almost certainly chosen to control production and shipment of lead from the Alston ore-fields, evidence for which has been assembled from a number of sources. Although an earlier, timber-built phase could not be identified, there are indications that the first stone-built fort of the early second century supplanted a pre-existing boundary or enclosure. The fort's curious lozenge shape is the adaptation of a standard military plan to match the shape and topographical advantages of the knoll. Thus, in a slanted fashion, it was able to accommodate a maximum of six barracks (or similar ranges) to the rear of the principia and four to the front, within a space of c. 1.2 ha. Extramural settlement has been recorded to the north of the fort, and an absence of features over a swathe of level ground to the south has been tentatively interpreted as a parade ground. Suggestions have also been made concerning the location of a mithraeum and other temples evident from historic collections of altars and statuary.71 DURHAM (1) Bowes (Lavatris), Holme Lea (NY 9905 1305): an excavation was carried out on the south side of Bowes main street in March 2008 in advance of proposed residential development.72 The area is known from previous work to have been occupied by civilian settlement east of the fort73 and the site lies about 50 m out from the ditch belonging to the defences and about the same distance north of the road emanating from the east gate. Elements of a masonry building equipped with a flagged floor were found on the east part of the site; this was provisionally dated to the third century. Poorly-surviving remains of gullies and/or building footings and a possible pit in the south-east corner indicate probable remains of earlier Roman occupation. Traces of one or more timber buildings were found on the west part of the site associated with large quantities of late first- and second-century pottery. An amphora fragment bore a crude inscription. This investigation is the first to reveal substantial and well-preserved remains of buildings outside the fort apart from the extramural bath-house. It is also significant in suggesting continuous activity on the site of the vicus from the late first century to fourth century A.D.74 69 Excavation for Birse Civils Limited was supervised for Oxford Archaeology North by P.

There were plentiful indications of masonry strip-buildings to both sides of the road within the area surveyed. (3) Sedgefield, East Park (NZ 3505 2894): further geophysical survey and excavation76 on this 'ladder-style' settlement ? currently unique in the North East.77 The geophysical survey was continued into the Show Field, between East Park and the village. This not only showed that the Roman settlement extended onto this area, but also clarified understanding of the settlement as a whole. Ditched and fenced enclosures lie on both sides of the main north-south Roman road, known in modern times as Cade's Road. Previous work suggested that these probably contained small household units, with some industrial activity taking place, such as pottery manufacture. To the east side of the road, the settlement widens out. In the centre of this area is a large, relatively open space surrounded by rectilinear enclosures. This area is accessed by smaller roads leading in from various directions and was presumably public space. In the north-west corner of this area is a small isolated enclosure, investigated in 2006, which contained a single building believed to have had a public function. Excavation in the rest of this area revealed a series of palisades which would have demarcated or defended the crest of a small hill on the western edge of the Show Field. The palisades belong to a previous layout of the settlement, before the dominant layout of enclosures visible in the geophysical survey. north yorkshire (1) Brough with St Giles: in excess of 136 base-metal radiates ranging in date from Valerian (a.D. 253-60) to Tetricus II (a.D. 273-4), found while metal detecting.78 (2) Filey: 75 silver siliquae (Constantius II and Julian Caesar (a.D. 355-60) to Honorius and Arcadius (a.D. 395-402)), 10 nummi (Valentinian I (to a.D. 375) to Eugenius and Arcadius (to a.D. 395)) and a pot sherd, found while metal-detecting.79 (3) Levisham: 20 nummi of the House of Valentinian and 6 stray Roman coins ranging from a.D. 138 to a.D. 222, found while metal-detecting.80 (4) Marton cum Grafton (SE 42 63):81 excavation of a moderate to high status Romano British burial, originally reported by a metal-detector, near Aldborough (Isurium Brigantum).

The fact that the grave cuts had been neatly and squarely cut into the back-filled ditch suggests that the earlier ditch earthwork still had some form of relative visibility in the local landscape prior to the internment of the bodies. Due to the nature of the post-deposition burial environment, consisting of sands and sandy silts, very little of the two skeletons survived but the recovery of coffin nails indicated that both bodies were buried in coffins. Both graves had a single pottery vessel placed at the foot end of the grave cut. Elsewhere within Block H a Roman period land surface was partially excavated containing a mixed assemblage of Romano-British pottery.

Residual sherds of second-century pottery were found.87 (d) Waggon and Horses Public House, 19 Lawrence Street (SE 6118 5139): excavation of two trenches revealed a sequence of deposits from Roman to modern date. Roman material uncovered may have belonged to a yard surface adjacent to a major Roman road on the south east side of York (Margary 2e).88 (e) Heslington East (SE 641 509): excavation of a Roman masonry building, measuring c. 5 m by 8 m and containing a small hypocaust system and opus signinum floor at one end, along with associated pebble surfaces and post-holes. A few metres from this building lay a human burial of an adult male who was suffering from spinal tuberculosis when he died. To the north was a series of ditches and pits, and to the west a substantial rectangular cobbled foundation, measuring c. 5 m by 6.8 m, for a structure of unknown function. The coin and pottery evidence, together with radiocarbon dating of the skeleton, all suggest that the site was occupied in the third and fourth centuries a.d.

The completion of the work demonstrated two pre-building phases: the first part of a 'ladder' settlement of Iron Age date, the second a series of enclosure ditches containing second century midden material. The Roman stone building had four phases; initially rectangular, subsidence led to the eastern wall being moved back to produce a winged corridor plan and in the third phase the main range was further narrowed ? at this time the main southern room was decorated with painted plaster and had a fireplace with a chimney stack. In the final phase, dating to the early fourth century, the pavilions were demolished and an iron-smelting furnace was established in the main room.94 LANCASHIRE (1) Lancaster, St Marys Priory Vicarage (SD 4733 6196): a watching-brief during works to a nineteenth-century boundary wall within the interior of the superimposed first/second-century and fourth-century Roman forts;95 this was located c. 4 m east of 1928-9 'Area 8',96 and c. 15 m south-west of a trench excavated in 1969,97 in both of which the Roman structures were poorly understood. Nineteenth-century levelling deposits behind the wall overlay the north-west corner of a substantial medieval ? or perhaps partly Roman ? earthwork visible in the vicarage garden. At the bottom of the excavations two parallel, short fragments of wall-robber trench, 1.1m apart, were revealed. These were orientated due north-south and probably therefore belonged to the Benedictine Priory of St Mary rather than the Roman forts, but the identity of the building to which they belonged could not be determined. Disarticulated human remains and residual Roman and medieval sherds were recovered from both the nineteenth-century fills and the robber trenches. (2) Poulton-le-Fylde, Garstang Road East (SD 35973 39286): several ditches and structural remains containing fragments of Romano-British pottery were identified during a watching-brief that monitored topsoil-stripping in a field to the east of Poulton-le-Fylde. Detailed excavation carried out subsequently revealed the remains of an enclosed settlement that was defined by at least two rectilinear ditched enclosures, with further ditches extending beyond the limits of excavation. Ring-gullies and post-holes within each of the enclosures represented the remains of two roundhouses with outer diameters measuring approximately 12 m and 7.9 m. Both roundhouses featured opposing double entrances that were aligned ENE-WSW, although the specific construction styles differed. Roman pottery, including sherds of mortaria, was recovered from features associated with the larger roundhouse, and also from the enclosure ditches. Domestic activity was further suggested by fragments of quernstones that were recovered from the site, whilst a group of stone-lined pits containing fragments of metal-working residues might indicate craft-working activity. A probable entrance to the settlement was revealed on the western side of the site. This consisted of a metalled trackway that was flanked by ditches and led to a gap within one of the enclosure ditches. The presence of four post-holes within the entranceway, and further post-holes within one of the backfilled ditches, suggested that the modification of these ditches might have been associated with the construction of a timber gateway.98 93 For previous work and plan see Britannia 29 (2008), 287-9. 94 Excavations by R.

Some of the ditches were up to 2 m wide and over 1 m deep and it is possible that they represent land boundaries defining the southern extent of the Roman civil settlement. Possible Roman-period timber structures were exposed, as well as many pits containing Roman pottery and domestic debris, some of substantial dimensions that may represent gravel extraction or refuse disposal. One pit produced an altar (see pp. 314-15) which sealed a decorated samian bowl of the second half of the second century A.D. The bulk of the pottery was of second to early third-century date, with small quantities of earlier and later material. STOCKPORT (1) Mellor, Old Vicarage (NGR SJ 9818 8890): community excavations of a hilltop settlement have been carried out since 1998.100 This is a multi-period site with continuous occupation from Late Bronze Age until probable closure in the late fourth century A.D. Romano-British activity centres in and around a Middle Iron Age ditched enclosure which was substantially re-modelled during the first to second centuries A.D. There is evidence for roundhouses, internal enclosures, and some craft specialisation. The artefacts suggest that the occupants exploited cross-Pennine trade links.101 WIGAN (1) Wigan (Coccium), Millgate (SD 58356 05569): excavation in advance of development in the centre of Wigan, some 70 m to the north-west of the Roman bath-house excavated in 2005,102 and incorporating the site of excavations carried out during the 1980s.103 The fragmentary remains of a probable timber structure and a few associated features were succeeded by a metalled surface, with a probable timber barrack-block on its northern side belonging to the second half of the first century. Its excavated ground plan suggests that it may have been a barrack-block of conventional early Roman type. A brief abandonment was succeeded by numerous post-holes and/or small pits, probably indicating structures in the area which were associated with pottery of the late first or early second century. Whilst the post-holes presumably indicated the presence of one or more structures on the site at this time, no coherent pattern could be discerned. Of this date were several hearths, with associated pebble and stone surfaces and concentrations of metal-working debris, as well as pottery wasters suggesting ceramic production locally.

Two cremation burials, probably of the same period, were recovered from the southern part of the site. The 'ladder' enclosure system, which is dated to the third and fourth centuries a.d., was 150 m long by 35 m wide and was divided into several sub-enclosures. There was a triangular annexe on the eastern side. Access to the annexe and the 'ladder' enclosure system appears to have been from the east. There was no clear evidence for habitation within the enclosure or annexe, although the pottery, glass and building material suggest that there was a building nearby.133 (2) 'South Northamptonshire': a base silver radiate and three plated denarii, deposited c. a.d. 260.

The eastern area contained a series of subdivided, square or sub-rectangular, enclosures covering a total area of c. 3 ha. Numerous pits and several ponds were revealed, although no buildings have yet been identified; however, some of the smaller gullies may have had a structural function. A large pottery assemblage consisted mostly of shell tempered pottery, in a coarse, oxidised fabric, broadly datable to the second to fourth centuries. The site is almost certain to have been involved with pottery production; fragments of kiln furniture were recovered, although no kilns were identified. The western settlement did include a small pottery kiln. The enclosures here covered an area of c. 2 ha, and had a less regular layout. Fewer pits were present, but a number of post-holes were revealed, along with several gullies that may have had a structural function. A smaller but still substantial amount of pottery was recovered, along with other types of domestic refuse. bedfordshire (1) Biddenham: (a) land west of Bedford development, Site 1 (TL 0272 4921): open area excavation of a single farmstead was undertaken (fig. 9).136 It comprised a system of rectangular ditched enclosures extending over 4 ha adjacent to the River Great Ouse, comparable to the three others known from previous investigations within the Biddenham Loop.137 The major difference from the previously investigated farmsteads was the absence of evidence for an origin in the late pre-Roman Iron Age.

They comprised parallel ditches, but no metalling survived. The trackways and the major boundary respected elements of the prehistoric landscape, e.g. late Neolithic/early Bronze Age monuments, middle Bronze Age fields, and a late Bronze Age/early Iron Age pit alignment. Prior to the recent investigations it had been thought that the extensive field-system, revealed by non-intrusive survey, originated in the Romano-British period.144 It is now clear that it actually originated in the middle Bronze Age and remained in use throughout the Iron Age and Romano-British period. In addition to a handful of burials of this period, an isolated bustum burial was also identified on the western side of the Loop (TL 0182 4836). It comprised a rectangular pit with burnt sides; its lower fill contained abundant cremated human bone, charcoal and nearly one hundred nails. Two complete pottery vessels were recovered from the burial: a large, locally manufactured jar and a smaller Nene Valley beaker dated to the fourth century. Similar burials have been found at The Lea, Denham, Bucks.145 (2) Kempston, land west of Bedford development, Sites 15 and 20 (TL 1700 4730): the system of bedding trenches reported previously146 was found to extend over an area of 70 m by 50 m. Four arrays of trenches were identified, all on the same south-west-north-east alignment and all containing trenches c. 31 m long and consistently 4.5 m apart. The nearest known contemporary settlement is over 300 m away, centred on Kempston Church End.147 The trenches were similar to ones found nearby on Bedford Western Bypass Sites 10148 and 13,149 although they do not appear to be part of the same extensive system. They are thought to be associated with the grow ing of vines or fruit hedges.150 HERTFORDSHIRE (1) Bishop's Stortford, Whittington Way (TL 4850 1900): an evaluation was targeted on the results of a previous geophysical survey. The results of the trenching revealed a Bronze Age ring-ditch, which had been reused in the Romano-British period. Extensive remains of a Romano-British farmstead and associated agricultural activity, possibly a vineyard, were also recovered on the western side of the site. A Roman enclosure, which may have had its origins in the Bronze Age, was sampled on the northern side of the site. To the west of this enclosure were further remains of Roman enclosures, and possible structures. A number of cremation burials 141 A.P.

Some the ditches revealed join Roman period ditches uncovered in a previous phase of fieldwork. A large silty spread was recorded, into which further ditches and probable clay quarry pits were cut. Over a hundred Roman coins were recovered by metal detector from the silt spread. Roman pottery was recovered from the ditches and pits. The pits were cut by later ditches, possibly drainage ditches associated with the Roman road, Akeman Street, that runs adjacent to the site. Two badly degraded skeletons of possible Roman date were uncovered.152 (2) Cold Brayfield, Brayfield Estate (SP 93369 52140): the earliest phase of activity was represented by Roman-period ditches. Fired-clay kiln furniture and debris were recovered from one of the ditches. Pottery suggested a third-century date. A group of pits and a second complex of ditches, which were higher in the stratigraphie sequence, dated to the third or fourth century.153 (3) High Wycombe, RAF High Wycombe (SU 834 787): two sherds of black-burnished ware and a sandy grey ware found in a tree-throw hole suggest Roman-period activity in the vicinity.154 (4) Shabbington, The Willows, Mill Road (SP 66552 06843): a watching-brief revealed late Iron Age to early Roman and second- to fourth-century activity in the form of drainage and boundary ditches with some pits Environmental remains show evidence of a very similar agricultural economy to that of the farming settlements of the gravel terraces of the Upper Thames Valley.155 (5) Winslow (south of): a hoard of 17 gold staters and 9 silver units, issues of Cunobelin, dep osited early first century A.D.156 MILTON KEYNES (1) Brooklands (SP 907 397): further excavation157 in advance of housing development revealed ditches assigned to the early Roman period on stratigraphie grounds. The landscape was remodelled, probably in the early second century, with the addition of three new enclosures and a track or droveway. A triangular corn-drier, made of roughly shaped limestone blocks with up to four courses surviving, was recorded in one of the enclosures.

This remained in use for some time, and was remodelled on several occasions. Pottery and finds assemblages suggest that, between the second and fourth centuries, the site was in agricultural use, managed from a nearby settlement. Environmental evidence suggests that pastoral farming of cattle and sheep was taking place in the Roman period. An isolated, undated female inhumation burial may be of late Roman date. Evidence of early Saxon activity on the site consists of two pits containing several sherds of Saxon pottery. (3) Milton Keynes: a hoard of 1,456 Constantinian/Magnentian nummi ending with 'fallen horseman' imitations, c. A.D. 355. The hoard appears to have been in a jar of pink grogged ware.160 (4) Newport Pagnell, Willen Road (S? 8750 4230): following an evaluation in 2005, excav ations were undertaken in 2006 and 2008 on an extensive prehistoric and Roman site between Willen Road, the Ml and the A422, in advance of gravel extraction.161 The southern part of the site contained a Bronze Age ring-ditch. North-west of the ring-ditch was part of an extensive Iron Age and Roman settlement, comprising a number of ditched enclosures, a large pond and a cremation cemetery. The settlement, which extended beneath the motorway embankment, originated in the early to middle Iron Age and continued into the late fourth century A.D. At least three circular huts were identified, although no occupation horizons or floor surfaces survived. A number of smaller, roughly rectangular stone features were also recorded. Their function has not yet been established, but similar features excavated at Bancroft, Milton Keynes, were associated with smithing or metalworking. Occasional quernstone fragments and animal bones suggest a mixed agrarian economy, and the range of finds is typical of a native Romano-British settlement. OXFORDSHIRE (1) Abingdon, Old Goal (SU 4984 9694): two phases of work were carried out, involving hand excavation within mechanically-excavated trenches, to identify the level at which Roman features and deposits survived compared to those found in earlier investigations and to assess the impact of recent activity on any surviving remains.

At least two gravel surfaces and traces of a later, but poorly preserved, limestone surface were seen. A sub-rectangular pit cut into the western edge of the road produced large quantities of late Roman finds and a couple of possible Anglo-Saxon sherds. Both the fill of the pit and the road surfaces were in part overlain by deposits including redeposited Roman building material ? flint, limestone, and brick and tile. These spreads were probably of middle Saxon date, although the great majority of the associated finds were late Roman. Notable amongst these was a belt buckle of Hawkes type IB; earlier finds included part of the head of a small bronze figurine, an intaglio, a spout from a rare ring-formed multiple lamp, and four fragments of roller-stamped box-flue tile, (b) Land adjacent to 86 High Street (SU 5772 9461): an evaluation recorded a mid-third-century ditch and two pits of possible late Roman date. These were cut into alluvium which contained a flint flake.166 (4) Kirtlington, Gossway Fields (SP 4985 1970): excavation on land north of Gossway Fields revealed residual first-century Roman pottery, indicating some activity of that date in the vicinity. A cremation burial was possibly of early Roman date. The earliest recognisable phase of activity was represented by a Roman ditch system defining fields of roughly similar size. The ditches were in use from the second century A.D. and were re-cut thereafter up to the fourth century. Several shallow gullies within the fields appeared to form a pattern of north-south and east-west alignments, alternating from field to field, and probably relate to agricultural practices. Towards the end of the third century or early in the fourth century one of the fields was made narrower. Pits, possibly for refuse disposal, were dug in the separated-off area to the east. The area of pits was then expanded to the west and a well was dug, while a building was erected to the east over the original area of pits. Only part of the building, which had stone foundations and a flagged floor, was revealed, so it is not clear if this was an isolated structure or part of a larger complex such as a villa. Imported pottery formed only a small percentage of the site assemblage. The latter contained a high proportion of oxidised coarse wares, including probable wasters, suggesting very local production perhaps intended specifically to supply a small nucleated settlement close to the junction of Akeman Street and the north-south Roman road from Oxford to Kings Sutton.167 (5) Letcombe Regis, Letcombe Laboratories (SU 3797 8634): a complex system of Roman ditches dating from the second to fourth centuries was investigated during excavation on part of the site of the former agricultural laboratories at Letcombe Regis. A second-century, rectilinear field-system was perhaps remodelled in the later part of the century and again at times in the third to early fourth centuries. The area appears to have gone out of agricultural use in the fourth century, possibly because of soil degradation over years of cultivation.168 (6) Mapledurham: a hoard of 6 AE sestertii and 2 AE dupondii/asses to c.

Within the enclosures were numerous pits, comparable to those already recorded in immediately adjacent areas, and occasional cremation and inhumation burials were placed adjacent to some of the ditches. Structural evidence remained elusive. Important finds from this area included a small stone figure of a female deity (head missing) of a recognisable Cotswold type, a small uninscribed stone altar, and the feet of a fired clay Venus figurine ? further additions to the body of religious objects already recovered from this site. One of the fourth-century pits produced, amongst much other material, the top of an elaborately decorated pottery face flagon and part of a well-preserved small basket, apparently woven from grasses. Much of the area of Tar Farm 5 was completely devoid of archaeological features, lying beyond the limit of Roman settlement. At its south-eastern margin, however, the line of the WNW-ESE Roman road was again encountered, some 300 m south-east of the most easterly part of Tar Farm 4. The road was defined by ditches c. 20 m apart but had no metalling, in contrast to the situation further west. A single row of regular rectilinear enclosures, also defined by ditches, was laid out on the northern side of the road. Parts of four such enclosures, each roughly 40 m wide and 50 m deep, were examined. Very few internal features were present (pits were notably absent) and these enclosures probably represented paddocks. There were no corresponding features south of the line of the Roman road, closer to the river. (9) Standlake, Malthouse Farmhouse (SP 3833 0334): six evaluation trenches totalling 79.6 m in length revealed ditches, pits and post-holes of Roman date.174 (10) Wendlebury, Alchester Roman town (SP 57652035): further geophysical survey was carried out for Planned Approach Ltd and a LIDAR survey commissioned by English Heritage.175 The gradiometer survey identified a main feature composed of a series of ditches enclosing a rectangular area. These ditches are characteristic of a Roman fort, especially as they suggest a double-ditched enclosure. The LIDAR survey shows the internal area of the enclosure to be slightly higher terrain. The enclosure is bisected by two parallel ditches running north-south across it.

Whether it is earlier, contemporary with, or later than the vexillation fort is unknown. The positioning of this fort is far more defensively-minded than the western fort. The river forms a natural protective barrier on two sides. It guards the ford on Akeman Street and a possible one on a projected line of the known road to the north, roughly where the railway now crosses the river. 6.

Two carefully-deposited pig skulls and feet, in close proximity to a scatter of Roman coins, were also found at the top of the eastern part of the ditch.180 (4) Eye area: a hoard of 1 gold quarter stater, 22 silver units and 1 bronze unit, all East Anglian types, dated early to mid-first century A.D.181 (5) Hoxne: 2 AR clipped siliquae of A.D. 378/9-388 and A.D. 395-402, addenda to the main hoard of A.D. 408.182 (6) Ixworth, Dover Farm (TL 94 69): a magnetometer and topographic survey were carried out as training for students on the Scheduled site of a Roman villa, first identified in 1849 and 177 Found by Mr V.

Several linear features form part of an early system on a very different alignment to the modern road and field boundaries. Adjacent to and aligned with these are indications of rubble spreads, but no coherent building plans.183 (7) Mildenhall, land adjacent the Smoke House Inn, Beck Row (TL 69 77; MNL 598): a 1.4 ha excavation in advance of housing development identified widespread evidence of Late Iron Age and Roman rural settlement and agriculture.184 The area lies immediately to the south of the site of a second/third-century timber aisled building interpreted as a malt-house185 and forms part of a wider landscape of known multi-period activity on the edge of the fens. Networks of ditches forming a variety of enclosure systems and field boundaries have been identified, together with a dense scatter of large pits which were possibly used for grain storage. One possible timber building was indicated by a line of post-holes. The finds assemblage includes pottery up to the third century, coins and brooches. (8) Near Saxmundham: 1 solidus and 59 siliquae (many fragmentary), addenda to an earlier find.186 The total now stands at 4 gold solidi and 117 silver clipped siliquae to A.D. 402. All the siliquae were heavily clipped (clipping factor 3-4) and few could be closely identified.187 (9) Near Wickham Market (DLL 013): a hoard comprising 788 Iron Age gold coins was found associated with the base of a wheel-thrown pot.188 Subsequently a small area was stripped of topsoil to examine the archaeological context. Further coins were retrieved from the ploughsoil, bringing the total number to 840, of which the vast majority were Icenian types plus five South Ferriby staters from the tribal area of the Corieltauvi. The excavation showed that the hoard had been buried in a small pit adjacent to a ditch of similar early first-century A.D. date. A later ditch contained Roman as well as residual Iron Age pottery sherds. The hoard is highly significant as it is the largest hoard of Iron Age gold coins discovered since the Whaddon Chase (Bucks.) hoard in 1849.189 (10) Near Woodbridge: a hoard of 8 solidi deposited c.

This latter was a Valentinianic SECVRITAS REIPVBLICAE type. (4) Colchester (Camulo dunum): (a) East HUI House, High Street (TM 001 252): the site lies in Insula 31/32 of the Roman town. Test pitting and trenching in 2007-8194 revealed the robbed walls and floors of at least two Roman buildings (presumably town-houses). A large (but residual) group of unused Roman stone tesserae may indicate the proximity of a workshop involved in the construction or repair of mosaic floors. The metalled street on the south edge of Insula 31/32 was exposed in three places, necessitating a slight alteration of its projected alignment. Its northern edge now aligns precisely with medieval Bastion 1 on the external face of the Roman town wall, (b) 10 William's Walk (TL 9971 2535): this site is in Insula 13 of the Roman town, to the south of the site of the Roman theatre. Evaluation trenching identified a small area of compacted gravel which is in the correct position to be the north-south Roman street between Insulae 12 and 13.195 (c) 21 St Peter's Street (TL 99595 25531): evaluation and excavation (2005-8)196 on this waterlogged site has exposed three wooden Roman drains, all north-south aligned and at a right angle to the north wall of the Roman town. The best-preserved drain was 11.5 m long, and consisted of two adjoining sections, each consisting of a base plank and two opposing upright planks either side held apart by wooden struts. A plank partially covered the drain, supported by evenly-spaced wooden struts connected to the upright planks by dovetail joints. Dendrochronological dating suggests an earliest construction date of A.D. 62. The drain was covered by a layer of septaria blocks and a mortary construction layer, both of which may be contemporary with the (later) construction of the Roman town wall. Two other wooden drains of the same construction and alignment were found 10.5 m to the east of the above (on the other side of a gravel 'road' surface). The direction of the 'road' surface, the location of the drains and the absence of the town wall in the vicinity of the drain suggest that there may have been a previously unknown gateway through the Roman town wall. Excavation to confirm this was not viable because of safety considerations. Two features cut into the western side of the gravel surface held large, well-preserved wooden posts angled upwards at roughly 45 degrees (pointing north away from the town) and held in place by packing stones. These features may have been defensive spikes (lilia). (d) 37 Oaks Drive (TL 9882 2517): the site is a short distance south of the Late Iron Age and early Roman site of Sheepen in the oppidum of Camulodunum. A watching brief revealed a Roman sand quarry.197 (e) Central Clinic, High Street (TM 0002 2532): the site lies in Insulae 15/23 and 24 of the Roman town, and partially within a Scheduled Ancient Monument (Essex SAM no. 1).

However, fragments of ditches indicate that there was a co-axial Roman farmed landscape here, aligned south-west to north-east, and possibly including an enclosure. The recovery of over 11 kg of Roman brick and tile indicates the likely presence of a Roman building in the enclosure.199 (g) Colchester Institute, Sheepen Road (centred TL 9880 2552): this site lies on the fringes of the Late Iron Age and early Roman Sheepen site in the oppidum of Camulodunum. Work in 2008 identified further areas of Late Iron Age and early Roman industrial activity and occupation, principally in the form of ditches and pits.200 Plentiful finds include pottery, a glass jar with a face of Bacchus, a set of gaming counters, pillar-moulded glass bowl fragments, and, perhaps of the greatest interest, a complete wooden paddle found in a pre-Flavian ditch. (5) Stansted Airport: (a) Mil widening scheme and airport access (TL 470 000-TL 520 230): an assemblage of Roman ceramic building material and pottery, recovered during fieldwalking,201 was largely undiagnostic. Concentrations were recorded at Little Hallingbury, Harlow Tye and Fiddlers Hamlet, corresponding with areas where Roman features and finds have been found previously, (b) Ryanair hangar (TL 540 222): excavation202 uncovered an enclosure dated to the middle to late Iron Age. This was abandoned by the time a roundhouse was built, probably during the first century A.D. A feature that had been cut into the backfilled enclosure ditch contained a large amount of charcoal and may have been industrial in use, possibly a kiln or oven. Gullies and ditches also uncovered represent field boundaries or livestock enclosures. The pottery suggests that activity at the site ceased during the second century, probably by c. A.D. 130.

(2) Princes and Bartlett Houses, 6-12 Basinghall Street, 93-95 Gresham Street EC2 (TQ 32570 81310): excavation and a watching-brief206 revealed a natural channel running across the site from west to east, which had been canalised during the early Roman period (mid-first century A.D.). This was then backfilled and an alternative channel cut further to the north. This appears to be related to drainage of the Roman amphitheatre to the west. There was a timber drain in the base of the cut and a later drain in another later re-cut (late first century A.D.). Other Roman activity was represented by a small area of early to mid-second-century clay-and-timber building stratigraphy and pits, two of which contained high quality decorated samian vessels. The later Roman period was also represented on the site, with third- and fourth-century ditches running north-south along the eastern side of the site, interpreted as later drainage of the amphitheatre area, and more pitting. (3) Cannon Place, EC4 (TQ 32620 80850): excavation and watching-brief work were carried out on part of the Scheduled Ancient Monument known as the 'Roman Governor's Palace'. The scheduling of the area was the result of the interpretation of archaeological observations made up to 1972 synthesised by Marsden.207 The central argument of the article is that: 'During the Flavian period, perhaps under the governorship of Agr?cola, the hillside was terraced for the construction of an enormous official palatial residence containing a large ornamental garden and several reception rooms of monumental proportions. It is concluded that this was probably the residence of the Roman Governor of Britain, built at a time when Londinium was, as a deliberate act of policy, enlarged and modified to become the capital city of the province of Britain. ' Following previous work in 2004, this phase of the Cannon Street Station redevelopment included excavation and/or monitoring of eleven new pile caps within the station's viaduct arches.208 Six of these areas were extensions of trial pits excavated in the 2004 evaluation. In addition, four trenches were excavated for new drain sump pits. The watching-brief monitored and recorded a series of 'starter pits' and other investigative trenches excavated on the east side of Dowgate Hill for the insertion of a series of king posts along the west side of the viaduct. Truncated, in-situ, natural London Clay, ranging in height from 3.5 to 4.15 m OD was observed in deep trenches towards the north end of Dowgate Hill and in a car park area beneath the station. Elsewhere, in-situ natural alluvial clay was recorded within the viaduct towards the west site limit at 5.19 m OD. In the central and east areas, in-situ natural sands ranged in height from 4.63 to 5.58 m OD. All Roman masonry has provisionally been dated to the first or second century. Extended excavation of areas previously visited in 2004 increased exposure of first-century internal brickearth partition walls as well as substantial first- and second-century masonry walls/ foundations. Whether the masonry all relates to the 'Governor's Palace' is unclear, but it seems likely that structural remains located towards the east site limit are associated with buildings interpreted by Marsden as lying within the 'Garden Court'.

Both walls had a width of c. 2 m. One section formed the south-west corner of the Hall, the other section extended from and to the west of the Hall and corresponds with a separate fragment of masonry previously recorded by Marsden (Wall 42A). Further west, fragments of two adjacent wall foundations, also c. 2 m wide, may represent an apsidal 'chamber', mirroring foundations of a structure Marsden recorded east of the Hall (Room 44). All surviving Roman and medieval masonry has been preserved in situ, sealed within a geotextile skin below a layer of sand. Work is due to continue in 2009. (4) Crosby Square (The Pinnacle), EC2 (TQ 33150 81270, 33133 81214, 33135 81239, 33150 81270): following work in 2007, three further phases of excavation and a watching-brief were carried out.209 In the first, excavation for the foundations of a service diversion gantry revealed a Roman opus signinum floor cut by medieval graves relating to the cemetery of St Helen Bishopsgate. The second phase of excavation, at 4 Crosby Square, revealed natural brickearth sealed by Roman dumped deposits. Over these was a series of Roman clay-and-timber buildings, the earliest of which were provisionally dated to the first century A.D. Along the eastern limit of the area, a mud brick wall was found with white wall plaster and a plain white, fine tessellated border. In the north-west corner of this area, cutting the clay-and-timber building, was a sunken Roman plunge pool, constructed from brick with a thick opus signinum floor and rendering on the internal faces. These features were cut by pits of late Roman or medieval date beneath a later, undated, dumping. A watching-brief undertaken on a trench for a secant wall on the east side of Crosby Square, was followed by an excavation. This revealed natural brickearth beneath the fragmented remains of Roman clay-and-timber buildings. These had been cut by a series of late Roman or medieval pits, which in turn were sealed by yard surfaces and walls of late medieval date. A small excavation on a sewer drop shaft at the junction of Great St Helens and Crosby Square revealed natural brickearth sealed by a thick Roman dumped deposit. Over this was a north south-aligned Roman internal wall with opus signinum floors on either side which appeared to have been destroyed in a fire and the foundation robbed, leaving only part of the eastern plaster face remaining. Demolition material sealed the remains of the building and over this was a later Roman opus signinum floor, probably the same floor found in the gantry trench immediately to the east, and similarly cut by medieval burials. (5) 20 Fenchurch Street, SEI (TQ 3308 8088): the first of three planned phases of excavation was undertaken on the south and central parts of the site.210 The second phase in the south east corner is ongoing. Although truncation by modern and Victorian basements was severe, substantial deposits remained across the site. Natural sandy gravel was capped in places by brickearth. Early Roman occupation on site consisted of surfaces, post-pits, beam slots and other structural evidence from the first and second centuries, although these were somewhat fragmentary due to later truncation. A line of large structural post-holes on the north side of the site, early in the sequence, indicated the presence of a first-century building. Some of these features may belong to the first-century fort found to the east at Plantation Place. In the centre of the site three sides of a late Roman cellar were found. It measured 5 m by 7 m and was over 2.5 m deep, the eastern extent being beyond the edge of the excavation. Most of the masonry had been robbed out after its disuse but the substantial ragstone foundations 209 Work by K. Pitt, Museum of London Archaeology, for The Pinnacle No. 1 Ltd (CYQ05). V.

To the north the wall was dug deeply into the natural slope, forming a terrace behind it. The ceiling had been supported by a large square column base built of Roman bricks. It was floored with mortar directly onto the natural sands. Later, part of the cellar was divided off by a thin partition wall between the column and the south edge. A second mortar floor may have been associated with this phase. In addition to an abundance of pottery, finds from the site included items of jewellery, a quantity of Roman painted wall-plaster, and a glass sherd with the letter 'A' inscribed on it. (6) 78-87 Fenchurch Street, EC3 (TQ 33480 81070): evaluation comprising the excavation of six trenches and two auger hole transects was undertaken within the existing basements on the site.211 In one trench, natural sand and gravel was cut by a probable Roman quarry pit containing a series of backfilled deposits. The secondary fills were redeposited terrace gravels which may have been used to fill and consolidate the ground, but could also represent a continually-renewed metalled surface. These were truncated by modern concrete. A trench in the south of the site, revealed natural gravels overlain by redeposited brickearth possibly representing fill or slumping from Roman quarrying. A third trench, on the east side of the site, contained natural brickearth over gravels, cut by a possible Roman pit. (7) Drop shaft outside 6-10 Foster Lane, EC2 (TQ 32180 81300): the excavation of a single drop shaft was monitored.212 A large north-south-aligned brick drain of possible nineteenth century date was observed beneath a gravel surface which was sealed by a deposit containing fragments of opus signinum, Roman pottery, oyster shell and animal bone. The layers above this were obscured by shoring. (8) 36-41 Gracechurch Street, EC3 (TQ 3292 8089): following work in 2007, a limited area excavation revealed a sequence of Roman clay-and-timber buildings cut through by medieval cess pits.213 The Roman sequence was horizontally truncated at 12.4 m OD or below and later Roman finds were recovered from secondary (medieval) contexts. The Roman remains are consequently limited to the first and possibly the early second century. Archaeological monitoring of construction activity also revealed an eighteenth-century well and a collection of material including ancient timber, Roman roof tile, and a brass object with classical decoration, possibly of Roman or eighteenth- to nineteenth-century date. This material was recovered from piling operations 6 m below basement depth and considered to be from a secondary twentieth century context. (9) 8-13 Lime Street, EC3 (TQ 33130 81020): following work in 2007, a watching-brief was carried out on groundworks during a piling programme within the basement.214 Natural brickearth was cut by backfilled Roman pits at the very northern end of the site, but no other features were observed.

Above these were a Roman masonry-lined well, which had been partly robbed out, a deep Roman pit containing substantial amphorae, and the remains of a number of clay-and timber buildings (including a carbonised beam or sole-plate with a lead base). These structures would have fronted a substantial Roman road running along the east side of the later Forum. (11) Mariner House, Crutched Friars, EC1 (TQ 33443 80865): excavation216 followed work carried out in 2006. The earliest features recorded were of late Roman date, mainly consisting of pits and ditches which have been heavily truncated by later activity, leaving only the bases visible in the natural brickearth and gravel. An east-west-aligned, V-shaped ditch recorded in a number of trenches in the north-west corner of the site, and a similar east-west-aligned ditch located further to the south, may represent property or field boundaries. Several pits containing Roman pottery were observed in the northern area of the site. These respect the line of the nearby ditch, suggesting that they were contemporary with it. On the east side of the site was a square feature, probably a well, which contained a number of complete Roman vessels, including black burnished ware pots, part of an amphora, a 'face jar', and a bowl with a maker's stamp. Traces of more substantial structures were tentatively identified in the western part of the site, including a robbed-out north-south-aligned masonry wall. However, the overall impression is that the site lay in open ground during the Roman period. (12) Piercy House, 7-9 Copthall Avenue, EC2 (TQ 3276 8141): following work in 2007, a watching-brief was carried out on the excavation of new drains in the basement car park.217 A dark silty layer containing pottery of Roman date was sealed by modern made-ground and concrete. (13) Riverbank House, Upper Thames Street, EC4 (TQ 32730 80670): excavation218 revealed the remains of the riverside wall which was built in the mid- to late third century A.D. to link up with the earlier city wall of Roman London. It consisted of a mortared flint core faced with ragstone and occasional tile levelling courses. The foundations comprised large timber piles with a chalk raft overlain by a single course of large blocks. The highest survival was at 2.70 m OD and the wall survived to a height of 1.40 m. Its full width was not seen. A single timber pile was recovered and may provide an accurate date for the construction of the wall, which at present is thought to have been built c. A.D. 270. Following recording, the face of the wall was protected by a permanent steel plate and backfilled with sand where appropriate. Several new piles were also relocated to avoid any damage to the river wall.

Grimes, working on behalf of the Roman and Medieval London Excavation Council in 1952-54, discovered the third-century Roman Temple of Mithras.219 Evaluation entailed the excavation of thirteen trial pits within the shallower basements across the site, and followed on from an earlier phase of works in 2005, in which three trial pits had been excavated. The most important discovery during the original evaluation was that part of the foundation of the north aisle 'sleeper' 216 Work by A.

That any remains of the temple survived was remarkable, as it had been thought that the building had been completely dismantled and the stone and tile reused in the reconstruction of the Temple of Mithras ? built later on a podium facing Queen Victoria Street on the north side of Bucklersbury House. The largest of the most recent evaluation trial pits220 was located to determine whether the south walls of the Temple of Mithras survived to a similar level as the north aisle wall in the adjoining trial pit. Despite the high level of truncation across the western half of the trench, the deposits to the east were well preserved and the remains of both the south aisle and the external wall of the temple were uncovered. Interestingly, the external wall had a timber shuttering to its south face, and was much more shallowly-founded than the aisle wall to the north. The base of the deeper aisle wall was defined 1 m lower, and it is assumed that the foundation was strengthened as it constituted one of the main load-bearing walls of the building; this supported an internal colonnade along the side of the sunken nave. It was known from the original work in the 1950s that the temple had been constructed on unstable reclaimed ground on the east bank of the Walbrook ? with the result that the building had been affected by subsidence and required repair and modification. The reasons for this were evident in the exposed face of the trial pit, which provided a sectional view of a large number of highly organic and originally waterlogged reclamation dumps on which the temple had been constructed. As well as revealing the foundations for the east end of the Temple of Mithras, part of a Roman clay-and-timber building was defined further south, occupying a similar position on reclaimed ground on the east bank of the Walbrook. The structure was composed of a substantial brickearth clay wall based on a timber baseplate supported on driven timber piles, with a number of internal floor and occupation deposits defined on either side of the wall. The Roman sequences recorded in the other trial pits included waterlogged fills and dumps in, or on the margins of, the Walbrook channel, two inter-cutting plank- and tile-lined drains cut into the reclamation dumps on the west bank of the Walbrook, and a decayed box-lined well. ENFIELD (1) 57 Leighton Road, Bush Hill Park (TQ 3400 9550): sample excavation failed to find any Roman material here just north of the southern boundary of the Roman settlement.221 (2) 61 Leighton Road, Bush Hill Park (TQ 3399 9551): sample excavation,222 following the discovery of Roman finds in minor building work near the southern boundary of the Roman settlement, identified a later plough-disturbed soil incorporating much Roman pottery and a single pit. The area appeared to have been used as a rubbish dump in the second and (to a lesser extent) third and fourth centuries. Together with work on backlog sites at 53 and 51 Leighton Road (where there was evidence for a western ditched boundary to the settlement flanked by a gravel path and areas of rubbish dumping, including furnace material and slag, and where a complete millefiori brooch was a notable find), it appears that some areas along a minor stream forming the southern boundary of the settlement were used from the second century as rubbish dumps, but activity may have decreased in the third and fourth centuries, perhaps due to settlement shrinkage. 220 Work by I.

The earlier road was flanked by a ditch and later by a fence. Evidence for occupation on the south-east side of the road clearly represented part of a linear settlement that, as previous excavations have shown, extended alongside the road into what is now the centre of Brentford. The evidence included the remains of two substantial timber buildings. These had burnt down and their earthen floors were covered with charcoal and burnt wall daub. Outside the buildings were bread ovens, hearths, pits, gravel surfaces and a possible cremation burial. Further investigation was undertaken of a large palaeochannel, probably a former branch of the River Thames, recorded on the south-east side of the site during evaluation in 2004. A trench revealed part of the profile of the channel, which was filled with a sequence of fine-grained sediments. No artefacts were recovered from these deposits during the excavation, but during the evaluation Roman pottery and a coin of Valentinian I or Valens dated to A.D. 364-78 was found in an upper fill. The lower channel fills are as yet undated, but included thin layers of peat/organic matter that might be datable by radiocarbon assay. Successive Roman field-systems, clearly delineated by ditches and gullies, lay between the settlement and the channel. The ditches defined individual fields and a track, possibly a droveway, running down from the settlement to the channel. A skeleton lay in one ditch and a crouched burial lay in a small grave next to another ditch. Most artefacts, especially metal objects, were found within the settlement, although some were recovered from field ditches. The finds included a large quantity of pottery, fragments of tile and burnt daub, 120 coins, two bronze finger-rings, brooches, tweezers and other toilet instruments, a stylus, lead discs, iron rings, blades and hooks, pieces of shale bracelets, quernstones and whetstones. ISLINGTON (1) Land to rear of 23 Goswell Road, EC1 (TQ 32043 82077): evaluation revealed no in-situ Roman remains. Three redeposited fragments of Roman pottery and tile were recovered.224 LEWISHAM (1) Honor Oak Park Sports Ground, Brockley Rise, SE4 (TQ 36505 74248): geotechnical pits and boreholes were monitored prior to redevelopment of the site. Around the Pavilion, deposits had been disturbed during its construction and made-ground was recorded in several pits, though one pit in this area contained gravel deposits approximately on a predicted alignment of the Roman road from London to Lewes (Margary 14). Geophysical survey then concentrated on the west side of the site and on the Roman road alignment.225 Two anomalies, potentially associated with the road, were identified. During a third phase of work, 17 evaluation trenches were excavated, including four to establish whether remains of the Roman road were present and 223 Work by R.

Three revealed areas of stiff, dark grey clay on which gravel layers were deposited almost exactly on the predicted road alignment. The fourth, furthest to the south, demonstrated that the road metalling had been truncated by the levelling of sports pitches where the road rose up a natural slope. A section placed where the survival of the road was greatest suggested the presence of a camber on either side. No other archaeological features associated with the road were identified. MERTON ( 1 ) Morden Park Baths, London Road, SM4 (TQ 24949 67476): two evaluation trenches on the western and eastern side of the baths revealed only natural London Clay and modern material.226 No evidence was seen for Stane Street, the Roman road believed to run close to the site. NEWHAM (1) Warton House, 150 High Street, Stratford, E15 (TQ 38350 83720): excavation at the north end of the site subsequent to evaluation revealed natural gravels cut by Roman quarry pits.227 (2) Work Package 6, Planning Delivery Zone 6, Olympic, Paralympic and Legacy Transform ations Planning Applications, El5 (TQ 3771 8496): natural floodplain gravels were recorded at the base of evaluation trenches, overlain in one trench by a possible later Roman consolidation deposit, and later alluvial sediments.228 (3) PDZ1 Olympic, Paralympic and Legacy Transformations Planning Applications: Trench PDZ1.12 Carpenters Road, Newham, El5 (TQ 3812 8417): excavations on the site designated PDZ 1.12 revealed several phases of archaeological activity that spans the periods from the later middle to late Bronze Age through to the Roman period and beyond.229 The site was located on a low gravel terrace that was probably dry land during much its history, perhaps a gravel island, associated with the braided river channels of the Lea Valley. A ditch system of middle Iron Age date was partly truncated by a substantial ditch containing small amounts of Roman material. This ditch had at least two phases of re-cutting, and two flexed inhumation burials nearby are believed to be associated with it, although neither contained grave goods. One was adjacent to the Roman ditch system and was oriented east-west, while the second was adjacent to the middle Iron Age ditch system and was aligned north-south. The location of the second burial suggests that the middle Iron Age ditch was still recognised as a boundary during the Roman period SOUTHWARK (1 ) 218-224 Borough High Street, SEI (TQ 32378 79717): a single evaluation trench revealed natural gravels overlain by alluvial silt containing residual Roman material.230 (2) Globe Academy, Deverell Street, SEI (TQ 32665 79070): excavation of a former nineteenth 226 Work by H.

The sand was cut by a pit containing Roman pottery, including a mortarium stamped SOLLUSF, a product of the potter Sollus, active in the Verulamium region c. A.D. 70-100. (4) London Bridge Tower (The Shard), 32 London Bridge Street, SEI (TQ 32895 80110): an evaluation was carried out under the service ramp of the former London Bridge Hotel.233 Natural brickearth was recorded beneath a peaty layer, probably indicating that the area was originally a floodplain or marsh. The peaty layer was sealed by a sequence of dumped layers, the earliest of which contained a substantial quantity of Roman building material of first- to third-century date. This included fragments of box-flue tiles, suggesting that a demolished Roman building (possibly a bath-house or a building of some status) may have been located near the area of development.

Part of the Roman city wall was then exposed when the modern building on the site was demolished.239 The exposed section of north-south-aligned Roman wall was 8.3 m long, a maximum of 2.5 m high, and in good condition, although it had sustained some ancient damage at the northern end where there were signs of possible rebuilding. A standing structure survey was carried out, including elevation drawing and photographic record. WESTMINSTER (1) 7-5 Dryden Street, WC2 (TQ 30360 81160): ten geotechnical test pits located at basement level were monitored, revealing cut features of probable Saxon date, containing animal bone and residual fragments of Roman tile.240 (2) St Martin-in-the-Fields Church, Trafalgar Square, WC2 (TQ 30084 80524): following work in 2006, an excavation was carried out in Area 7, north of the National Schools building in the north-east corner of the site, while a simultaneous watching-brief was undertaken in Area 8, within the eastern basement of the building.241 The earliest activity recorded dated to the time of the Roman Conquest. This took the form of a structure at the eastern end of Area 7, laid out on a north-east-south-west alignment and consisting of two slots which were truncated by the construction cut for the National Schools building. The western edge of one slot was on the same line as a north-south cut, and may have been a later re-build of the same property, even though it was on a different alignment. The slots probably held timber beams, since no masonry was found. Due to its prominent position, this structure may have had a military function, although it could also represent a late Iron Age/early Roman farm. These features were sealed by an homogeneous layer dating to the second half of the fourth century which also sealed the backfill of a quarry pit at the eastern end of Area 7. There may have been further Roman remains in the central part of Area 7, but these would have been destroyed by extensive Saxon pitting. Cutting the fourth-century layer was a large circular feature, probably a Saxon well, servicing buildings on either side of it. The remains of a ragstone and tile wall or post pad were recorded to the west of the well, while the remains of a second possible wall, made from ragstone and chalk, and possibly aligned north-south, survived to the west of the central 'open area' in the middle. This had been laid over the backfill of a Saxon ditch, suggesting that the Saxons had reused Roman building material to construct their wall, as masonry is not normally associated with Saxon construction in Lundenwic. 238 Work by A.

The present summary contains the revised dating and interpretation of the site.</page><page sequence="48">266 ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2008 Three phases of possible Roman activity were recorded at the western end of Area 7. The earliest was represented by a supine, east-west-aligned burial cut into the natural brickearth. Only the lower arms and upper legs had survived, in poor condition. The backfill of the burial was sealed by a brickearth surface which showed signs of weathering and evidence for roots, suggesting that the area had been abandoned or left open to the elements. This was truncated by a group of stake-holes and post-holes thought to be associated with a later mud-brick oven which represented the latest phase of possible Roman activity at the western end of Area 7. Several deposits of debris from this feature were recorded and are still being assessed. To the west, a separate room or property contemporary with the oven was represented by mortar scars, a beamslot and post-holes. The remains of another room/building were present further to the west and included a probable beamslot and a fragment of floor. The oven had been truncated by the remains of an east-west beamslot, from which pottery of sixth-century date was recovered. To the west, and apparently contemporary, was another early two-room Saxon building, represented by a north-south-aligned beamslot and a possible east-west brickearth sill (which would have supported a wall) between two fragments of brickearth floor. Sealing the rooms were two further phases of Saxon building. The central section of Area 7 produced a series of large pits containing Roman, Saxon and medieval pottery. These appeared to be rubbish pits and related to an external/open area of land between the eastern and western areas of construction. Saxon pits were also recorded during the watching-brief in Area 8. Refined dating from the burials excavated in Area 4 (in 2006) suggests a group of Late Roman inhumations in the vicinity of the sarcophagus. As well as the discovery of the early Roman structure in Area 7, therefore, evidence now points to the possibility of a Late Roman sacred site or small settlement on the site, which the Saxons appeared to respect and maintain as a religious place. In addition, there is evidence for continuity from the Roman period into the Saxon, in a settlement area (Area 7) to the north-east of the burials.242 8. SOUTH-WESTERN COUNTIES By PAUL BOOTH GLOUCESTERSHIRE (1) Bourton on the Water, Sycamore House, Lansdown (SP 1644 2092): a watching-brief recorded a post-hole of Roman or earlier date, thirteen features dating to the Roman period, two undated walls, and a limestone well likely to be post-medieval in date.243 The Roman features represent at least two phases of settlement activity. Several ditches and a possible industrial feature were dated to the second century A.D., whilst evidence for a building, surviving as three walls and a surface, was of third/fourth-century date. (2) Cirencester (Corinium Dobunnorum): (a) Corn Hall, Market Place (SP 0238 0198): excavation occurred inside the Corn Hall which lies immediately to the north-east of the projected line of Ermin Street within Insula XXIII of the Roman town.244 Construction works required the archaeological excavation of an area 12 m by 11 m to a level which lay within 242 Work by A.

A depth of c. 1.5 m of archaeological deposits above natural accordingly remained largely unexcavated; the exception to this being four pits, each 2 m square, which were dug to natural to take the foundations for a mezzanine floor. One of these pits was within the main excavation area, while the other three lay to the south-east of it. Natural gravels were covered by a clay relict ground surface, which was cut through by several quarry pits. The ground surface was overlain by consolidation deposits which produced pottery consistent with a date in the first or early second century a.d. Above these a stone building was constructed, one wall of which survived to a height of 24 courses. Little of the plan of this structure can be determined as it remained largely unexcavated, nor is it clear whether there was a preceding timber phase. The most likely interpretation is that the walls formed part of a range of shops which lay behind a portico flanking the north-east side of Ermin Street. Only the rear wall of the portico lay within the excavation area, and this had been extensively robbed. Successive surfaces built up within the portico during the second and third centuries, presumably in response to the rising level of Ermin Street caused by resurfacing. Within the shops successive floor levels were found, one associated with an oven, although only small upstands of stratigraphy had survived medieval stone robbing and pit digging. At some point in the third or fourth century the building was demolished and replaced by a structure on a new layout. This extended for a distance of 11.25 m behind the portico, the walls being founded on rough rubble footings. The portico wall was also rebuilt in cruder work. The front wall of the portico may also have been reconstructed at this time, as the foundations for a masonry pier, 0.7 m by 1 m, were dug through earlier surfaces within the portico. It is conceivable that this relates to a slight narrowing in the width of the portico, an original stylobate wall (which must have lain just outside the excavation area) perhaps being replaced by a series of individual piers which supported an arcade. Only one pier fell within the excavation area. (b) Tar Barrows (SP 031 025): geophysical surveys around the monuments known as Tar Barrows, located some 500 m north-east of Cirencester, have revealed the remains of an extensive settlement outside the walls of Corinium. During 2007 and 2008 extensive magnetometer surveys examined an area of approximately 16 ha around the eastern barrow, while a ground resistivity survey was conducted over slightly less than 5 ha of the same area. Tar Barrows are thought to date to the later Iron Age or early Roman periods, although Reece noted recently in this journal that their presence on the hillside overlooking the River Churn might explain the deviations of the Fosse Way and Ermin Street from their intended alignments.245 The magnetometer survey results (fig. 12) indicate a complex pattern of ditched tracks and enclosures, many of which appear to contain square and rectangular masonry structures. The barrow itself is located within a square enclosure and it is thought that the monument is one of the settlement's earliest features. At least four other ditched enclosures, each containing a rectangular stone building, extend to the south-west and north-east of Tar Barrow (the most southerly of these is open on its south-western side). A trackway along the western side of this row of enclosures is on the same alignment as the Fosse Way as it approaches Corinium from the high ground to the north-east. Another trackway at right angles to the first would appear to connect the Tar Barrows complex with the Fosse Way. The area to the south-east and east of the main barrow is more open and contains numerous small stone-built structures that seem to be arranged in rows. A series of ditched enclosures runs along the side of the Fosse Way, at least two of which are packed with pits. A very large ditched enclosure, some 75 m by 54 m, lies to the north-east of the occupied area. This is sub-divided into smaller internal enclosures, again containing stone structures, some of which are apparently 245 Britannia 34 (2003), 276-80.</page><page sequence="50">268 ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2008 FIG. 12.

The newly discovered settlement at Tar Barrows covers an area of approximately 350 m by at least 200 m. The north-east to south-west alignment suggests that it post-dates the Fosse Way and the original settlement at Cirencester, though it is possible that the barrow itself, which appears to have become the main focus of later activity, predates the arrival of the Roman army and its surveyors. The small square and rectangular stone structures arranged around the barrow would seem to be too small for domestic buildings and it is Suggested that these are mausolea set within funerary enclosures. The pits that produced high magnetic readings are tentatively</page><page sequence="51">PAUL BOOTH 269 interpreted as cremation burials set within more communal funerary enclosures that lined the western side of the Fosse Way as it neared the Verulamium Gate of Corinium.246 (c) Kings hill North (SP 0365 0250): excavation revealed a grave containing an inhumation aligned east-west, with the head to the east. The skeleton was of a mature adult male aged 35-45 and was supine and extended. The hindquarters of a sheep or goat had been placed beside the skull. No finds were recovered to give any indication of date but it is suggested from the burial rite that it is Iron Age or Roman. A series of pits also belongs to the late Iron Age or early Roman period. One pit contained a seemingly deliberately-positioned quernstone.247 (3) Dymock, Kyrleside, High Street (SO 6998 3112): excavation to the rear of the property revealed Roman features consisting of pits and post-holes, with pottery dating predominantly to the first century A.D. Evidence for smelting was found, with some pits containing large amounts of slag and also some crucible fragments.248 (4) Frocester, Frocester Court villa (SO 785 029): excavation between 1995 and 2008, combined with some geophysical survey work, has added much to the history of the development of the site.249 The origin of a major land boundary and a trackway are now dated to the late Neolithic period. These survived as landscape features that probably determined the location of the middle Iron Age farmstead and the extent of its field-system. In the Roman period the farm continued to develop and the field-system was replaced by larger paddocks, mostly within the area enclosed by a major extension of the south-east perimeter. In the second century A.D. a threshing-floor of mortared stones was constructed in the bottom of a large gravel pit dug in this part of the site. The pit was eventually fenced off and was backfilled with debris and domestic rubbish, much of it from site clearance associated with the erection of the third-century villa. This dump was partly covered by a roundhouse and an adjoining approach road that predated a small courtyard with wing walls, part of a semi-monumental arched estate entrance. A post-built industrial structure situated close to the south-east perimeter ditches housed a group of T-shaped kilns and circular and elongated furnaces or ovens. It was destroyed by fire and was replaced by a similar but less well-preserved complex alongside the north-east boundary. These are interpreted as early and late fourth-century maltings. A post-Roman, part sill-beam based structure was associated with the collapse of the entrance-courtyard wall, and traces of features of two similar periods of occupation were identified near the north-east boundary. All predated the medieval ridge and furrow, as did a small outlying group of inhumation burials, one of which returned a radiocarbon date of eighth- to ninth-century. The excavation has now ended.

The pottery dates spanned the Roman period, but there was a particular emphasis on the Late Roman period. (8) Winchcombe, Greet Road (SP 0246 2920): excavation in advance of housing construction recorded evidence of Iron Age, Roman and post-medieval activity.254 Iron Age settlement was concentrated in the northern portion of the site. Roman settlement was also focused in the northern portion of the site and was represented by possible enclosures and linear features, dating to the first century a.D. Some of these reflected the alignments of Iron Age features, suggesting a continuation of use from the Iron Age into the early Roman period. A second phase of Roman activity was represented by the build-up of a ploughsoil or terrace deposit which overlay the earlier Roman ditches in this area, indicating a period of abandonment or withdrawal. The area was resettled later in the Roman period when a stone building, associated with high status finds, perhaps suggesting a military connection, was constructed on the terrace. Only the south-east corner of this building was exposed during excavation, although at least two phases of construction were identified, indicating that it had been extended at least once before being abandoned by the early second century a.D. somerset (1) Bath (Aquae Sulis): (a) Gainsborough Building, Beau Street (ST 7496 6460): excavation occurred on the site of Roman hot baths which were partially recorded by J.T.

To judge from his plan, there were at least two successive buildings, the earlier of unknown function, the later clearly a baths utilising water from the nearby Hot Bath spring.255 A series of large, flat, stone blocks was exposed immediately to the east of an apsidal bath recorded by Irving. They appeared to form three steps leading down, but from their finish and size seem fairly clearly to be the result of the robbing of very large blocks from a massive masonry structure not unlike the large, solid ashlar buttresses in the Temple Precinct of Sulis Minerva. Overlying the 'steps' was clay levelling into which was cut a stone culvert and two walls. The culvert ran north-west to south-east and utilised the lowest course of the 'steps' as its base. The walls of the culvert did not display any signs of the staining which would be expected if it had transported hot spa water. It may have supplied or drained cold water from the apsidal bath. The culvert was cut through by an east-west wall which can probably be correlated with one recorded by Irving. A fragment of floor surface survived to the south of this wall. A wall parallel to, but immediately south of the former cut though this floor level and so is presumably a replacement. Two north south walls, 3 m apart, defined a probable corridor. Immediately to the east of this room was a large room, with a smaller room added to the west. A succession of floors was found within the large room. Through the top of the latest of these floors was cut a stone-lined, rectangular pit which contained a coin hoard. The hoard was lifted as a block and probably contains in the order of 1,500 coins. It will be excavated and conserved in Bath Museum. Preliminary examination of about 260 coins which became detached from the block suggests that the hoard was closed in the a.D. 260s. The large room was sub-divided at some date by the insertion of at least two partition walls, while a north-south wall associated with a stone flagged floor is even later still. A thick deposit of demolition debris overlay the clay levelling in a second area. Cut into this was a north-east to south-west-aligned stone culvert, which, in turn, was truncated by a later wall. 253 Work by H. Meara, Oxford Archaeology, for Newbridge Construction Ltd. E.

Those quarries with good ceramic dating are clearly late Saxon/early medieval in date. The overwhelmingly negative evidence tends to support the suggestions of earlier researchers that there was no road running directly south out of the core of the civic and religious centre ofAquae Sulis and no southern gate in the Roman wall. (2) Kingsdon, Glenda Spooner Farm, Brincil Hill Lane (ST 51051 25791): a geophysical survey and evaluation were conducted along the line and either side of a Roman road.258 The Roman road was bisected by three trenches, where it was seen to survive in varying degrees of preservation. The road itself was heavily truncated, with only the lowest courses of its rubble sub-base left. In some places, even this had been heavily disturbed and dispersed with fragments of ceramic field drain mixed amongst the stones. Some fields displayed stone on the surface on the line of the road. No trace of an agger was seen under this stone layer. The southern roadside ditch survived in places and there appeared to be traces of a northern ditch as well.

It has been assumed to turn towards the south-west at Up Loders and to run past Bridport towards Chideock. Evidence has been found to indicate that the Roman road ran on a more northerly course which would avoid a block of high ground north of Chideock and follow an easier and more direct course towards Axminster. A 5 m-wide stony strip observed running north of west across an arable field at Boarsbarrow Farm between the above grid references is probably the remains of the road.

A new section was excavated through the north-south ditch (Clarke's F12) which formed the original eastern boundary of the cemetery. Dating from the graves excavated through the ditch fills suggests that the cemetery expanded across the boundary in the A.D. 350s. Furthermore, burials were identified in an area previously thought to lie outside the bounds of the cemetery to the east. The burials in this area may well be amongst the latest in the cemetery, possibly even dating to the fifth century. Numerous grave goods were recovered during the excavations, including pottery and glass vessels, personal ornaments (crossbow brooches, buckles, bracelets, finger-rings, beads etc.), antler combs, coins, and hobnails from shoes. Some of these are unusual objects, with some most closely paralleled on the Continent. Two graves in particular contained grave goods unlikely to have originated in Britain.277 ISLE OF WIGHT (1) Carisbrooke: a hoard of 28 AE dupondii/asses to A.D. 167. 271 Work by H.

Four were too worn to be fully identified; one coin appears to have a bust and may have been of Imperial date. (2) Barcombe, Church Field (TQ 4190 1425): in 2008 a new research and training project was started in Church Field, which is adjacent to Dunstalls Field, the site of the Barcombe Roman villa which was excavated between 2001 and 2007.284 Previously, field walking, geophysics and test-pitting had indicated the presence of a Roman-period building with a hypocaust. In 2008 excavations revealed a large Roman bath-house, measuring some 20 m long by 6 m wide and aligned approximately north-east to south-west. At the northern end of the complex is a praefurnium with walls of mortared flints. The south-western side of this room had a tile base some 1.2 m wide set into flint masonry. This tile base would have been used for either a hot bath or a steam tank/boiler. To the west of the tile base was the caldarium which had a projecting apsidal hot bath on its south-eastern side. At the apex of this semi-circular structure was a tile lined drain running south-eastwards towards a large drainage ditch which is orientated parallel to the longitudinal axis of the baths. The ditch was in-filled with large quantities of rubble, both tiles and flints. The ditch may have discharged into the stream which forms the south-western side of Church Field. To the south-west of the caldarium was the tepidarium and on its western side this still contains part of the mortar base of the room, with some of the hypocaust pilae columns represented by the bottommost tiles in situ. In addition there are also traces of an in-situ covered channel (perhaps a drain) formed of imbrex tiles. Other parts of the floor in this room had been cut through by a large feature, possibly a ditch which served a postulated and smaller second-phase bath-house to the south-west. At the north-west corner of the bath complex is an area of curved mortar which may represent steps into another (?cold) bath. Further west still, and on the same alignment as the flint-walled rooms described above, were a number of walls with 279 Excavation by Pre-Construct Archaeology in 2006 (see Britannia 39 (2008), 329 for the site).

These walls may belong to the postulated second-phase baths. The source of the water needed for both phases of baths is likely to have been a spring/s to the north/north-east of the excavations. Provisional dating for the baths spans the second to fourth centuries, but in contrast to the broadly contemporary villa site in Dunstalls Field, the baths appear to have been demolished/robbed in Roman rather than medieval and/or post-medieval times. It is not known how the baths related to the nearby villa. Perhaps they were part of the villa complex, or possibly the wider villa-estate? Alternatively they may have belonged to an unrelated neighbouring settlement, perhaps one located on or near the site of St Mary's church. Nearby, on Culver Farm, Rob Wallace continued a programme of survey and excavations in order to establish the routes of two Roman roads.285 SURREY (1) Ashtead, Ashtead Common villa and tileworks (centred at TQ 1775 6017): excavation was completed in the area near the centre of the 'front' of the villa.286 Evidence was found for a number of robbed-out walls and other features that make it possible to suggest some phasing for the building, and better understand the previously published evidence. An area with a rammed chalk floor may be part of a structure earlier than the villa, as already suggested by A.W.G. Lowther.287 The foundations for the original front wall were also located, with associated stub walls of flint and (mostly) tile, in the area of Lowther's postulated 'porch'. There was no evidence for the latter in the form previously suggested. A small apsed feature was later added in this area, but still as part of an early phase. The corridor floor as recorded in the 1920s can be seen to be part of a later phase, probably associated with construction of the tile gutters around the building, which themselves must be later. Probably at the same time the level of the villa was substantially raised, using building demolition material, presumably in an attempt to deal with the unpleasantness of the site when wet. The two main early and late periods may relate to phases revealed in a new section of the ditch running close to the rear of the building near the junction of Rooms 10 and 8; a small area of the latter's tessellated pavement was also uncovered, surrounded by robbed-out walls. In its second main phase the ditch was probably re?ut and rapidly backfilled with rubble to act as a linear soakaway for the bath-block attached to the villa. The wall junction found by John Hampton and others in the 1960s to the north-east of the villa288 was relocated and studied in more detail. The walls had clearly been built in sections and there were two related tile-built features of (currently) unknown purpose. No dating material was found except for the tiles in these features and built into the walls, and there was little sign of occupation material of any kind. It remains unclear if this was simply the corner of an enclosure wall or part of a building, possibly related to the tileworks known to exist close by to the east. Further magnetometer and topographical surveys by Archaeology South-East have located possible kiln sites in this area which it is intended to test in 2009 and later. The results of environmental sampling carried out some years ago in one of the quarry pits have now been analysed by Professor Martyn Waller of Kingston University, who has also obtained a 285 Work by D.

This matches well with other dating evidence for the overall site that indicates occupation and activity mostly across the second century. Work on gathering and recording all known finds from the site is continuing and good progress has been made with study of the ceramic building material. Significant finds from the excavation included a bronze cockerel, probably part of a set on a stand with a figure of Mercury and other relevant animals, and stratified pottery, including substantial parts of three vessels that had apparently been smashed in situ. These were in an area with other rubbish and it is therefore unlikely that they were ritual deposits, but they seem to predate the villa building whose construction can therefore be tentatively dated to around the end of the first century A.D. or early in the second. KENT (1) Bigbury and South Blean (centred at TR 1170 5750 and TR 0660 5640 to 0975 5635): a walkover survey of the known hillfort of Bigbury Camp, 3 km west of Canterbury, prior to proposed tree clearance within the known earthworks, clarified some details of the recorded earthworks and re-assessed the extent of the earthworks within and beyond the Scheduled Ancient Monument.289 Since recognition as a hillfort in the late nineteenth century, this site has been damaged by small-scale quarrying but has been the subject of three major archaeological investigations.290 In the present study, contour survey of the putative eastern entrance suggested that one of the more prominent earthworks here related to a presumed post-Roman hollow way but that the outermost earthworks returned to link with the north-eastern corner of the previously identified hillfort annexe, rather than with what is a recent drain at the base of the northern hillside. To the south and south-west, the line of Parish Road, now the Centenary Walk, Canterbury, may represent an extensive outer work, visible as denuded multiple earthworks below Bigbury Wood (TR 1175 5705). Slighter earthworks within the hillfort annexe and to the west probably represent recent wood banks. In the South Blean, 2 to 6 km to the south-west of the camp and west of Chartham Hatch village, an extensive series of earthworks was identified within woodland. Substantial but much denuded earthworks, sometimes forming multiple parallel banks and ditches, were traced following the contours of a ridge overlooking the Stour to the south. Although undated, these features appeared to predate a system of wood banks and the line of a medieval or post-medieval trackway heading towards Chartham Hatch. Traces of a small hilltop enclosure, pit complexes and possible field terraces along the southern hillside were also identified in an area where traces of early iron-working are known. If indeed of early date and associated with Bigbury Camp, these earthworks may form part of an extensive territorial oppidum extending along the high ground to link with the hillfort on the spur overlooking the early Stour crossing. (2) Birchington, Monkton Road Farm, Seamark Road (TR 28551 66910): continued excavat ions ahead of a 90 hectare greenhouse development uncovered a further seventeen cremation burials, some positioned alongside a partially metalled trackway.

Several small pits, drainage gullies and a large rectangular pit appeared to be associated with the building. Ditches representing possible field-systems and the various cremation burials, either isolated or strung along trackways, suggest the presence of a substantial settlement, perhaps in the area of a widespread cropmark complex to the north-east of the site.292 (3) Canterbury (Durovernum Cantiacorum): (a) Best Lane (TR 1486 5793): evaluation prior to the extension of the Beaney Institute revealed evidence for a Roman building situated immediately north of the line of a major street.293 Road or yard surfaces were capped by floors for a building. Building materials included roof- and flue-tile, opus signinum and tesserae.294 (b) St Mildreds Tannery: the ongoing watching-brief on a major residential development concentrated on the central part of the site (TR 1450 5770). Further evidence was found for a large building south-west of Roman Watling Street and for a smaller one facing it across a back street flanked by a wide leat. A substantial flint and tile wall apparently closing off the riverward end of this street was partially dismantled. What was probably a Roman clay floor was exposed in a test pit south-east of the river (TR 145 8 5 7 61).295 (c) 19 Wincheap (TR 14439 57250): excavation prior to redevelopment revealed a number of early pits containing domestic refuse. A timber structure was represented by five post-holes and a beamslot, over which a series of clay floors showed signs of successive repairs indicative of a long period of use. East of the structure a sequence of metalled surfaces, which extended beyond the limit of the excavation, may have been the remains of an open yard associated with the timber building.296 (d) Ryde Street, St Dunstans (TR 14207 58246): a single evaluation trench cut prior to house construction revealed early Roman activity in the form of gravel metallings for a yard or street, and perhaps evidence for quarrying of the same date. Redeposited brickearth, perhaps indicating quarrying, was cut by a Late Roman cremation burial, comprising a cinerary urn with two accompanying pottery vessels and fragmentary iron nails possibly representing pyre goods. The cremation is the latest Roman burial thus far recorded in Canterbury and is located further east than the previously recorded extent of the London Road cemetery.297 (e) Old Dover Road (TR 15725 56590): evaluation prior to development at St Lawrence Cricket Ground revealed an unurned cremation burial, some 40 m south-west of the road frontage. The Old Dover Road follows the projected alignment of the Roman road from the town's Ridingate towards Dover.298 (4) Deal, Deal Waterworks, off St Richards Road(TR3645 5090, centred): excavations ahead of a new housing development revealed a number of ditches relating to a rectilinear field-system.299 Further traces of this system had been previously recorded on the adjacent Dossett Court site.300 The pottery indicates that the ditches date to the first and second centuries.

Insufficient was exposed to add significantly to the known plan of the fort but it appeared that the Roman walls represented several separate phases of work.301 (6) East Farleigh, Oaklands, Lower Road (TQ 7280 5350): further excavations on the previously reported villa site302 have confirmed the size of Building 3 as 8 m by 28 m. The building is believed to be a store-building or granary. Some walls remain to a height of 1.2 m. An internal division wall and possible ovens were located on the last day of excavation in 2008. A fifth building, 13 m wide with a 2.4 m entrance with semi-circular reveals, has been located. Work continues.303 (7) Eastry, Farthingate (TR 3130 5470): casual fieldwalking to the south-east of Eastry parish church revealed a scatter of Roman pottery and roof-tile fragments on a hill-slope overlooking a small stream.304 The pottery ranges in date from the first to the fourth centuries A.D. and the finds suggest the presence of a previously unknown settlement, conceivably a villa. The site lies downhill from the medieval manor house of Eastry Court, believed to overlie an Anglo-Saxon royal palace. Excavations at the manor house in 2007 failed to locate any certainly Roman features or Anglo-Saxon remains.

Approximately 0.6 m deep, the feature contained several extensive fills, most of which consisted of a well-rotted, peat-like material, almost certainly formed from generations of reeds growing in a wet environment. The relatively high proportion of Roman finds retrieved and preliminary post-excavation assessment have resulted in tentative interpretation of the feature as a water tank.306 (b) Land at Wingfield Bank (TQ 6222 7257): an excavation followed an evaluation carried out in 2007.307 A natural hollow was revealed in the northern part of the site. The hollow was enclosed by a ditch containing Iron Age and early Roman pottery. These features were overlain by alluvial silts from which a Late Iron Age gold coin was recovered. A building identified by two beamslots was observed to the west of the hollow. Two Roman ditches lay either side of the structure; the one to the west contained a large quantity of first- to second-century pottery. Similarly-aligned ditches were also observed to the east of the site. A possible Roman cellar was recorded. A beamslot, two post-holes and several stake-holes were revealed at the base of the feature.308 301 Work by . Parf?tt and . Corke, Canterbury Archaeological Trust. Information sent by K.

Finds Reported under the Portable Antiquities Scheme By SALLY WORRELL INTRODUCTION The Portable Antiquities Scheme was established in 1997 as an initiative to record archaeological objects found by the public and was extended to the whole of England and Wales in 2003.1 Surveys of Roman period finds recorded by the PAS have been published in Britannia annually since 2004. This sixth report gives a brief overview of find types and their distribution, followed by descriptions of significant individual artefacts and assemblages recorded by the Finds Liaison Officers. OVERVIEW 48,212 artefacts were recorded on the PAS database in 2008, 23,973 (49.7 per cent) of which are Roman in date. As before, this figure includes those finds to which a date has been attributed that spans the late Iron Age and early Roman period. The 2008 data include 3,495 pot sherds, 25 glass vessel fragments, 6 quernstone fragments, 89 tile and architectural fragments, and 14,608 coins and other metallic objects (as well as 5,738 coins included in the Treasure process). The total number of non-Treasure metallic objects recorded is very similar to that from 2007 (14,833). Objects that qualify as treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996 are published in the Treasure Annual Report by the British Museum and are excluded from this survey (with the exception of a hoard of Late Iron Age copper-alloy vessels and the gold crescent-shaped pendant amulet (Nos 1-3 and 28, below)). Table 1 shows the number of Roman non-ceramic artefacts recorded on the PAS database by county and grouped by PAS region. For convenience of presentation and to enable comparison with other dataseis, the Roman non-ceramic artefacts have been subdivided according to function, based on the scheme proposed by Crummy, with some modifications.2 As in previous years, the 2008 data include only a small quantity of the many artefacts recorded from Norfolk, although all records from that county have been entered onto the Norfolk Historic Environment Record. As in all previous years, coins are the most common artefact reported; the 11,478 single coin finds recorded this year account for 78.57 per cent of all metallic finds.3 Again there is some variability between counties in the percentage of all finds accounted for by coins. In 23 counties more than 100 coins were recorded. Coins comprise on average 80.4 per cent of finds in these counties, but the proportion varies from 60.3 per cent in Wiltshire to 90.5 per cent in Cambridgeshire. Leaving aside the atypical data reported for 2006, the increase since 2003 in the percentage of coins recorded by the Scheme noted in last year's report has continued. The percentage reported this year (11,478 coins; 78.57 per cent of finds) is slightly higher than in 2007 (11,343; 76.7 per cent), with significant increases in the number of coins recorded in East 1 S.

This reflects the continuing success of the initiative to record large assemblages of Roman coins known as 'grots' found by detectorists, as referred to in last year's report. Overall, the number of coins documented on the PAS database, almost all of which will have been found on rural sites,</page><page sequence="66">284 ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2008 is considerably more than double the number recorded from rural and temple sites in Reece's study in 1991.4 A doctorate currently in progress has identified 458 groups where more than 20 coins have been recorded by PAS within the same parish.5 The quantities of artefacts recorded in other categories remain broadly comparable to those previously reported, but with a decrease in the proportion accounted for by religious (F) and miscellaneous objects (L). Brooches account for 11.2 per cent of all finds recorded and other items of personal adornment 3 per cent. In both these categories, there are again high numbers from Lincolnshire and Suffolk. In the thirteen counties with large samples of brooches (&gt;40), the proportion of total finds accounted for by them varies from 5.5 per cent in Hertfordshire to 35.1 per cent in Norfolk. Many of the sixteen counties where more than ten other items of personal adornment have been recorded also have high numbers of brooches. The proportion of other items of personal adornment varies between 1.5 per cent in Cambridgeshire and 11.8 per cent in Norfolk. As ever, there is substantial variation between counties and regions in the quantity of artefacts recorded and the variation documented this year closely follows that observed in previous reports. Only small numbers of metal objects have been recorded in much of Wales and in several northern and western English counties and much higher quantities in eastern English counties, especially in Lincolnshire, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, East Yorkshire and Leicestershire. The number of artefacts, both coins and others, recorded from East and North Yorkshire and Cheshire, and to a lesser extent from West Yorkshire, has substantially increased in 2008. Nevertheless, while the number of Roman period finds recorded for individual counties may fluctuate, depending on particular circumstances, such as the reporting of significant groups of material or collections, the regional dimension in the quantities and types of artefact reported to the PAS is now firmly established. This is true in general terms as well as in points of detail. For example, the distribution of button-and-loop fasteners reported in 2008 occurs predominantly in North, East and West Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, a pattern noted in last year's report, which examined all such finds reported to the PAS since 1997.6 The ancient and contemporary factors responsible for these distribution patterns ? including the production, circulation and deposition of metal objects in the past, and subsequent land-use, contemporary agricultural regimes and detecting patterns ? now require further exploration.7 ARTEFACT DESCRIPTIONS The entries below set out some highlights of the past year's discoveries recorded by the Finds Liaison Officers.8 Fuller details of the objects recorded by the PAS can be obtained from the Scheme's central office,9 and there are full descriptions of finds on the PAS website: www.finds. org.uk.

Follow-up archaeological investigation of the findspot established that all four artefacts were deposited into the same bog or lake edge context, probably with votive intent. The tankard was deposited possibly, though not demonstrably, at a similar time to the vessels. Since it was not a directly associated object, it was deemed not to be Treasure. Further research into the landscape and environmental context of the hoard and tankard is planned. (1) A virtually complete copper-alloy, lathe-finished bowl of shallow, squat form with a rounded base. It has a low girth, upright neck and everted rim, which is decorated with incised circular grooves and wavy lines, set in low relief. A copper-alloy cast escutcheon, with a ring for hanging and storage, is attached by a shank which perforates the vertical rim. The decorative escutcheon is lobed and winged with insets containing a red 'sealing wax' glass. Some damage is evident, caused by differential erosion in the ground and minor denting during retrieval. The vessel is 99.5 mm high, the internal rim diameter is 174 mm, and the maximum diameter of the body is 220 mm. The object weighs 356.5 g. (2) A virtually complete lathe-finished, copper-alloy bowl of identical form to No. 1. It is decorated with incised circular grooves and infilling 'ladder' work. The escutcheon, secured at the rim with an internal washer, is similar in form to that on No. 1 and has a central bi-concave 'toggle' motif defined by lateral incised margins. The bowl is damaged through differential erosion and recent denting: there is a long gash around the girth. The vessel is 86.5 mm high, the internal rim diameter is 164 mm, and the maximum diameter of the body is 205 mm. The object weighs 243.1 g. (3) A complete copper-alloy wine-strainer with a round-bottomed body with a rounded lip and a wide flange. The flange has a raised outer rim. The base of the bowl is decorated with a perforated pattern in a circle of approximately 100 mm diameter. A triskele design with circular flourishes at the end of each limb is defined by the absence of perforations, while the surrounding perforated spaces are made up of three arched trumpet motifs, each occupying 120 degrees of the circular design. The strainer has a simple looped escutcheon with a suspension-ring, attached to the underside of the flange. The flange is slightly nicked, dented and scratched. The object is 113 mm high, the internal rim diameter is 131 mm, the width of the flange is 23.5-25 mm, and the external diameter of the flange is 179 mm. The object weighs 223.3 g. (4) A virtually complete, wooden, stave-built tankard with sheet copper-alloy fittings and a cast copper-alloy handle. The vessel has a near-vertical profile with a simple rim and a flat raised base, which has been slotted into grooves in the six staves. Two wide and continuous circular bands of sheet copper-alloy surround the outer circumference of the tankard and an overturned narrow strip of copper-alloy forms the rim. The cast handle is plain with a continuous C-shaped back and T-shaped lateral plates attached to the body by two pairs of bronze rivets with slightly 10 The geographical sequence here follows that set out in the 'Roman Britain in 20xx.

The tankard has suffered some cracking, damage and shrinkage during the drying out process. The vessel is 150 mm high, the internal rim diameter is 150 mm, the base diameter is 166 mm, the staves are about 11.5 mm thick, and the handle is 78 mm long. The two bowls may be identified as of the Southern British 'Rose Ash' type, a Late Iron Age/native form which has been dated to between c. 50 B.c. and A.D. 50. The escutcheons are of Late La T?ne style with lip and wing mouldings which echo a wider mid-first-century A.D. development also seen on horse and chariot equipment. The red 'sealing wax' glass is of Iron Age tradition. However, the lathe finishing and circular grooves on these vessels suggest manufacture in the mid-first century A.D. The wine-strainer is one of a small known group with broad flanges and without handles.13 By virtue of their association elsewhere with trullei, dippers, oar-handled 13 D.

However, this example is decorated with a native or 'Celtic' triskele design and is fitted with a suspension-ring indicating it forms part of a set with the Iron Age bowls. A date of manufacture between c. A.D. 40 and A.D. 60 is proposed for the strainer, while the hoard of bowls and strainer is thought to have been deposited c. A.D. 50-75. The tankard is a native form of vessel used for communal drinking of beer or cider and is especially prevalent across western Britain. It is one of only six known complete surviving tankards from Britain and Ireland. Its plain handle and form ally it with examples of Class V tankards.14 The existing parallels are thought to span the mid-first to fourth centuries A.D. However a close parallel for the tankard handle comes from a well at the Roman fort of Loughor, Swansea, for which the depositional context is thought to date to the early to mid-second century A.D., suggesting that this form of tankard was made and in circulation c. A.D. 50-150. The tankard (not Treasure) has been acquired by the National Museum of Wales which also hopes to acquire the bowls and strainer. 14 J.X.W.P.

The central cruciform component has a domed boss and traces of white-metal coating between three sub rectangular strap attachments with scrolled terminals, each containing a copper-alloy pin. One damaged copper-alloy junction loop survives. A rectangular, ridged panel is located above a hinge which holds an incomplete harness pendant of tear-drop form. While numerous pieces of military harness are known from the first and early second centuries, few later examples have been recorded. Prior to the Antonine period, the loops of phalerae were concealed. The change to placing loops around the edge of the phalera, as in this example, is also seen on a phalera with junction loops from Newstead, Scottish Borders.16 More recently many artefacts of Late Iron Age to Roman date, including numerous Roman military fittings (harness-strap fittings, pendants and decorative mounts) have been recovered from outside the Roman fort of Brecon Gaer at Yscir, Powys.

The body of the pan is convex and one side has sustained some damage; the rim has been pushed in, no trace of a handle now survives, and the base is missing. The body is decorated with an enamelled chequerboard pattern of four rows and thirty-three columns of square cells. Although the enamel does not survive in all the cells, it is clear that each row and column had alternating red, dark blue, turquoise/pale blue, and yellow squares. Diagonal lines of the same-coloured cells recur, but there are insufficient columns for this pattern to be fully repeated. Much of the light green patina has worn off the inside of the bowl and on the exterior of the rim. The bowl is 38 mm high, has a distorted external rim diameter varying between 51.5 mm and 92.5 mm, the thickness of the rim is 1.8-2.6 mm, and the base diameter is 58 mm. The vessel weighs 112.6 g.

Each half contains traces of what appears to be solder on the internal surfaces at the head and tail. The fish has a triangular lateral fin on each side and a small, triangular dorsal fin decorated with finely incised lines. The base is flat and the incomplete tail is mostly missing on one side. The surviving side of the tail curves strongly upwards, terminating in a rounded end, but the tail fin is missing. Situated below the fish's gill, the base has a rectangular fitting (12 mm long, 9 mm wide, 1.5 mm thick) which projects from the right side. Close to the centre of the fitting are three raised square mouldings set within a slight recess beneath the fish. There are contiguous mouldings on the other half of the fish but there is no sign of a similar projection on the left side. The eyes are represented by a central dot of blue enamel surrounded by a ring of black enamel. The gills and mouth are also depicted in black enamel and the body and tail are decorated with three or four rows of wide crescent (half-moon) cells filled with green enamel. The fish is 67 mm long, a maximum of 12 mm wide, and weighs 10.06 g and 9.5 g. It has not been possible to find a direct parallel for this object, but its decoration is similar to that on Romano-British enamelled vessels of K?nzl's neo-Celtic style group,40 as seen on the flask with crescent and elongated triangle cells in red and blue enamel from Catterick.

Enamelled brooches sometimes take the form of a fish, but none has close similarities to this example. This fish may be a gudgeon or other bottom-feeder, but other identifications cannot be excluded: the flex in the tail might, for example, be intended to represent a leaping movement. The function of the fitting is uncertain. Three-dimensional handles depicting dolphins, attached to vessels at the mouth and tail and also decorated with enamel motifs, are known from Verulamium and from Ambleteuse, Pas-de-Calais (a two-handled vessel), but this object could not have served this function.42 Although not contemporary, a similar fish, rendered in three dimensions and identified as a rainbow trout or salmonoid, was associated with the hanging bowl from the Sutton Hoo ship burial and connected to an escutcheon at the base of the bowl by a pedestal.43 (14) Wellingore (LLN-2BE126) (fig. 8).44 An incomplete copper-alloy, phallic type amulet in the form of a hand with the fingers clenched and the thumb thrust between the index and middle finger making the mano fica gesture. The sides of the hand are decorated with longitudinal grooves. The hand projects from one end of a straight-sided fitting with a semi-circular perforation which curves down at the broken end. When complete the perforation would have been circular and a phallus would have adorned the other terminal. The object is 42 mm long, 20 mm wide, and 6 mm thick. An amulet similar to this example was found at 9 Blake Street, York.45 Other examples of this form of phallic amulet are known from military contexts in Britain and on the Continent, including two complete copper-alloy amulets from Vienne and Lyon.46 Both the representation of the mano fica gesture and the phallus are apotropaic in function.

The creature has a sharply curving 'hooked' beak, with no sign of nostrils, and pointed ear-tufts. A moulding extends from the beak and passes below the eye to the ear. A raised oval panel on the griffin's head runs from between the ear-tufts down the back of the neck to a point and is decorated with four longitudinal cells depicting feathers. Near the base of the panel, the feathers are inlaid with pale enamel, either white or yellow. Below the griffin's neck the mount tapers and two moulded ridges form a triangular cell on each side of a sub-rectangular cell. No traces of enamel or other possible settings survive. The reverse of the mount is concave. It measures 42 mm high, 28.9 mm wide, 24.5 mm deep, and weighs 24.8 g. No close parallel for this object is known, but a copper-alloy fitting probably from a metal vessel, decorated with a griffin's head, occurs in the high-status burial at Lexden, Colchester.49 Griffin iconography is rare on Roman artefacts from Britain, but examples include a vehicle mount representing the foreparts of a griffin from Trawscoed, Merionethshire,50 and later Roman razor handles.51 colour fig. 7.

The solid head is disproportionate in size to the body. The large eyes are almond-shaped with small raised pupils and clearly defined eyelids. Beneath the broad nose, the simple mouth is represented by a short, horizontal line. The full hair is swept over the ears to the nape of the neck and is defined by incised curving lines which extend back from the high forehead. The beard is full, close-cropped, and in places defined by stippling. The moustache is long and drooping. The small flat ears have little definition other than the prominent outer frame. Both incomplete arms are raised, with the right arm crooked. There are incised chevrons on the lower arm. The torso is rectangular and the front has cast decoration which may represent armour or clothing, although abrasion has removed much detail. The base is relatively flat with a sub-rectangular socket, which is 22.8 mm long, 4.6-6 mm wide, and 8.5-10 mm deep. This socket provides the means for fixing the figure as a mount. Its style suggests that the object dates from the Tetrarchie period (A.D. 293-313), when very short hair and beard were more common, as seen on the porphyry bust of Galerius in Cairo.53 It has not been possible to find a close parallel for this object, although the portrait has some similarities with the bronze figurine depicting a late second- or third-century cuirassed emperor, also with almond-shaped eyes, allegedly from England, and a bust which might portray a usurper emperor of the late third century.54 Figurai vehicle fittings with a rectangular-socketed base are known from Cologne and this object perhaps served a similar function.55 colour fig. 8.

The upper body and head are bent back at the shoulders; the legs are truncated but widely splayed as if straddling a horse. The lower body is naked and the hips very wide. The V-shaped line across them indicates the crotch and the buttocks and prominent labia are also emphasised. The waist is narrow and there are slight indications of breasts. The reverse surface of the upper body is covered with a grid of incised horizontal and vertical lines suggesting scale armour, while the vertical lines on the lower body may represent the pleats of a military tunic. A curved line represents a collar and the sleeves are wide and appear to end at the elbow. The right arm extends outwards and is bent at the elbow; it ends in a large fist that is likely to have held a weapon. The left arm is truncated. The head is disproportionately small and the face, though worn, appears feminine.

The mouths are represented by a short horizontal line, and there is slight wear on the rounded muzzles. The skirt is scalloped in shape and is decorated with four pairs of incised lines extending from the moulding. Its edges are notched to give a regular patterned edge, which is considerably worn in places. It is likely that each corner would have terminated in a rounded knop: traces of two survive. Beneath the skirt a mass of iron corrosion obscures the detail of the missing mount for attachment. The object is 46.5 mm high, 35.1 mm wide, 4 mm thick, and weighs 54 g. The form of the Cholesbury fitting is difficult to parallel. The hoop's small internal diameter (11 mm) suggests that this object is unlikely to have been used as a rein-guide. However it is very likely that it functioned as a harness-fitting to secure a leather strap. Other similarly-sized objects, with loops with internal diameters ranging from 12 to 19.8 mm, and presumably of a comparable function, have been recorded by PAS from North Thoresby, Lines.

Its weight suggests a highly-leaded copper-alloy, as indeed does the colour of the metal on a scuffed area on the figurine's back. The quality of the piece, of competent though not excellent workmanship, may suggest that it is a product of a Romano-British workshop. Other large figurines of Mars include examples from the Foss Dyke, Lines., Barkway, Herts., and Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.67 A fragment measuring 62 mm in length and consisting of only the helmet crest from a large figurine of Mars (or Minerva) was found in Kirtling, Cambs.

For example, fourteen figurines, generally less than 100 mm high, have been recorded by the PAS between October 1997 and June 2009.

It comprises a five-sided front plate with a triangular terminal at its apex. There is a perforation in the outer foil of the terminal, and one smaller perforation and one incomplete blind hole in the two remaining foils. Both sides of the plate have been cut down in antiquity. The elaborate, chip-carved, geometric decoration comprises, on the (originally) rectangular half of the plate, two rectangular panels containing running scrolls between what remains of four square panels, each of which contains a swastika. The triangular section of the plate has a central panel containing a rosette, within small, sub triangular geometric panels and bordering lines of punched dots. There are twin rivet-holes at the worn, straight outer edge with transverse notches. One rivet-hole contains a copper-alloy rivet that retains a fragment of the triangular back-plate on the reverse. Part of the terminal of the back-plate, now separated from the other fragment, remains attached by solder to the reverse of the front-plate. FIG. 14. Caistor St Edmund, furniture legs (No. 21).

The figurine is 32 mm long, 6.8 mm wide, 21.5 mm tall; the base measures 16.3 mm long and 8.6 mm wide; the object weighs 13.5 g. The snout is flat-ended and upturned ? a feature more reminiscent of a domesticated pig than a wild boar ? as also seen on figurines from Hounslow, the Gower peninsula, Muntham Court, W Sussex, Chesters, Aldborough, Colchester, and Camerton ? the last being stylistically the closest to this figurine.79 The short tusks are prominent and incised lines represent the eyes and hair. The sub-rectangular ears are upright with a small depression at the front. On the stylised dorsal crest, the bristles are indicated by slightly curved, incised lines which slope forwards. The poorly modelled tail is similar in style to that on the Iron Age boar figurine from Woodingdean, E Sussex.80 The fore legs are angled slightly backwards and the hind legs are bent with a slight casting flaw between them. The hooves are cast directly onto the base, which is worn and damaged around the edges. Unusually, the udder is clearly shown beneath the belly and this is the first example depicting a female wild boar.

The 'Celtic' cap of hair is moulded and incised lines show the hair converging at the back, before splaying out below. The eyes are pointed ovals and the mouth a simple horizontal line; most of the nose has been lost to corrosion. On both surfaces a deep V-shape incision below the head defines the bust. The dolphin heads are equally well-moulded, with the upper 'lips' curling up and adjoining the human head. There are drilled holes in the lower parts of both jaws and punched ring-and-dot motifs for the eyes. As with the human head, the dolphins are decorated on both sides, which is an atypical feature since the reverse of most Type II buckles is flat and undecorated. The dolphins' bodies are decorated by incised lines and punched crescent-and-dot stamps ? the latter on the front surface only. It has been suggested that the crescent-and-dot stamps might represent scale armour on the shoulders of a soldier, rather than forming part of the dolphins' bodies.88 Protruding at right angles from the side of the frame are two perforated circular lugs retaining traces of the corroded iron axis bar which would have held the pin, now missing.

He took RSOT to the find spot where the landowner has now cemented it into a patch of crazy paving, incidentally breaking it into three pieces. The village has no Roman associations, but is only c. 1.5 km SSE of the find-spot of the Wool tombstone (Britannia 31 (2000), 433, No. 2 = RIB III, 3046). 3 The diagonal break in the first line suggests that the previous letter was A, which is inherently probable, but there is no sign of the incision. Flavia is much the most likely name, but Octavia is also possible. If not the wife of Marcus, she was his daughter (filia, perhaps abbreviated), but the spacing would be less neat. ?

The surface is somewhat pitted and worn, and the triangular mark to the left of is probably casual damage. 5 The lettering cannot be dated closely but is c. A.D. 100/150.

A centurion called T(itus) Flavius T(iti) f(ilius) Pup(iena tribu) Rufus is already attested for Legion II Augusta (CIL xi 20 (Ravenna) = ILS 2082), but can hardly be the primus pilus since there is no mention of the primipilate, and this centurionate is only the third of four.

It is unlike the Chesters aqueduct inscription (RIB 1463, c. 180), but has affinities with RIB 1049 (Chester-Ie-Street, 216) and 1060 (South Shields, 222), which suggest a text beginning with the name and titles of the emperor who 'provided water' (aquam induxit) 'for the use' (usibus) of the cohort 'under the charge' (curante) of a legate, and ending perhaps with a consular date. The emperor's name and titles have been lost in the space above line 1, so the surviving text comes from the bottom half of the slab(?). It is unclear whether its whole width was preserved: despite the virtual continuity between lines 2 and 3, it looks too narrow, especially as VSIBVS has probably been lost before 2, and DVXIT before 5. The ligatured et in 5 suggests a consular date, but the only possibility seems to be Lupo et Maximo (232), which is not very close to Dugdale's transcript.

A dedication de(ae) H..., to a goddess with an aspirated, un-Roman name, is just possible but unlikely; the lettering is too remote from 'Veteres', despite this deity's frequency at Vindolanda, and the many ways of spelling its name which include initial and the feminine gender. Perhaps therefore deis maternis, despite there being no explicit instance of this dedication.

G, not C, for the praenomen G(aius) is unusual, but for another example from Chester see RIB 539. The nomen is not necessarily Valerius, but it must have been short, since line 2 begins with the cognomen, and would have been preceded by the patronymic in the formal nomenclature of a legionary. Valerius, often abbreviated to VAL, is frequent in northern Italy and Gallia Narbonensis, and is typical of legionaries in the early Principate: there are many British examples, including RIB 478, 479, 480, 539, 540, 541 and 542 from Chester. The cognomen Pudens is also frequent, examples including the legionary L(ucius) Valerius Pud[ens] at Chester (RIB 542). Line 3 is incomplete, but entirely consistent with MACEIA, which is apparently a slip for MAECIA, Maecia (tribu). The voting-tribe should properly follow the patronymic, but is sometimes found in delayed position: British examples include RIB 539 from Chester. In this graffito, however, it seems to have been added as an afterthought or correction, no doubt to emphasise that the writer was a full Roman citizen with voting-rights at Rome.</page><page sequence="105">R.S.O.

Inscribed lead tablet consisting of a rectangular strip with the lower end rounded, 60 by 103 mm, cut from sheet lead c. 1 mm thick, found before 1901.27 One side was first inscribed with a fine point, then the text was hidden by attaching the tablet to something with two pins of which only the pierced holes remain. Subsequently these pins were withdrawn, and the tablet was folded upon itself twice, leaving the text visible. This consists of seven lines of clumsy New Roman Cursive letters fourth-century in date, inscribed line by line in reverse sequence from right to left.28 The height of these letters is irregular, and increases line by line; in 3 and 4 they have been damaged by the fold, and their forms are most clearly defined in 6 and 7.29 fig. 12.

However, the regularity of the right margin, and the indenting of lines 2 and 7, confirm that he wrote from right to left. He seems also to have lapsed occasionally into rightward sequence, NVS in 1 and TI in 2, unless he was actually attempting anagrams. 29 , and V are difficult to distinguish, since they consist of downstrokes (minims) linked by weak diagonals.

Letters restored or supplied are in brackets. See further, next note. 32 Commentary line by line (reading from right to left): 1. The first letter has a long descender but is apparently N. The name Nimincillus is not attested. The second name, Quintinus (compare RIB 349, etc.), was reversed ineptly or deliberately written as an anagram. 2. The third letter has been damaged by the pin-hole, but what survives resembles V rather than N; perhaps V was repeated in error. The name Iunctinus is not attested, but is likely to be luncinus (compare RIB II.6, 2494.136 with note) with hyper-correction of the process seen in RIB 369, defuntus for defunctus. It is followed by DCILLINAE, apparently a matronymic with O omitted in error: identification by mother's name is preferred in some magical texts; see Tab. Sulis 30, 1 (with note). However, it is possible that a nominative Docillina was intended, E being a mistake for O. Docillina (for Docilina) is one of a group of names derived from Docilis which hides the Celtic name-element found in Docca; it occurs at Uley (Britannia 20 (1989), 329, No. 3) and in RIB II.2, 2417.34. 3. The fourth letter is O repeated in error, not the expected G. The name is probably followed by another in anagram form, but surface-stresses due to folding make the reading uncertain. 4. This line is also badly damaged by surface-stresses, and the reading is uncertain. The concluding VE may be taken with the next line as eu(m), the antecedent of qui, since eum qui involaverit is formulaic (see Tab. Sulis 10, 44 and 61; Britannia 22 (1991), 293, No. 1). The omission of the unsounded ?m is trivial (compare mala(m)), and the author may not have known or anticipated that the verb det would require the dative. 5. The second letter was written as N, but V is required by Q and has apparently been supplied below, invalaverit is a variant of the formulaic verb involare which is also found at Uley (Britannia 21 (1998), 439, No. 1 with 441, note to line 4) and Pagans Hill (Britannia 15 (1984), 339, No. 7).</page><page sequence="107">R.S.O.

A septisonium (properly septizonium or septizodium) was apparently a monumental fa?ade incorporating statues of the seven planetary deities who gave their names to the days of the week. Septimius Severus' septizodium in Rome is the best known example, but others are attested in Lambaesis (CIL viii 2657 - ILS 5626), Africa Proconsularis {CIL viii 14372 = ILS 5076) and Sicily {AE 1964, 182).

The difficulties are discussed in detail by RSOT in his contribution to the final report.

DVL is for duicia, literally 'sweet (things)', and must be equivalent to the defrutum of the Soissons dipinto, also found as DEF in dipinti on South-Spanish amphorae (Haltern 70) which contained olives in syrup.

The same abbreviation is found on a samian sherd from Mumrills (RIB II.7, 2501.60). Underneath, within the foot ring, a previous graffito has apparently been erased. 55 The praenomen Titus is quite often used on its own as a cognomen.

The second A has a third, vertical stroke, but the others do not; and the third could even be read from a different angle as T, especially since it is followed by faint marks which might be two letters, although they are probably casual. LL resembles the initial II, but the strokes extend slightly at the foot. C cannot be read as G, unless the second stroke was omitted in error. Greek halli- often occurs in compounds ('beautiful'), but Calliusla as a personal name is very rare, and apparently used only as a nomen. Hermatis, one of several names derived from Hermes, is also rare.</page><page sequence="118">336 ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2008 33. Ibid. (fig. 29).

Some drawings are omitted here, as well as three Dressel 20 graffiti made before firing, since they comprise two letters or less; seven samian graffiti as being non-literate marks of identification (intersecting lines, including two stylised 'palm branches'); and a coarseware graffito of less than two certain letters. Thirteen stilus-tablet fragments were also found, but only five were inscribed; apart from isolated letters, only one word could be recognized (see No. 35). 58 is twice the height of , as S is of E, but a continuous text was apparently intended. There is no Latin form noxies, but perhaps the writer conflated the adjective noxius with the participle noce(n)s, both meaning 'harmful'. The object is certainly not a label inscribed with name(s) or quantity, and the use of lead, the piercing, and the enigmatic text, all suggest malevolent intent.</page><page sequence="119">R.S.O.

'(Product) of Sextius Servandus.'60 59 The lower position of actum suggests that it was added separately, perhaps to mark the execution of a legal document (a contract, loan note, etc.). Actum is usually followed by a note of place and date, but not here. Three intersecting lines have been scored to the left. If they covered the whole document, such crossings-out would indicate its subsequent cancellation. 60 In (i), V and A, although now damaged, were evidently ligatured. In (ii) the second S is preceded by an indistinct mark, perhaps casual damage caused by the hot iron.

The third letter, if indeed P, is differently formed from in (ii). The two graffiti are thus by different hands. 62 The full loop of is not certain and the letter might be E, but visually this is less likely. R is also incomplete, but the only other possibility is the rare letter K. The termination -ACVM indicates a place-name, and if preceded by CAPRI-, one derived from the nomen Caprins, the name of the estate-owner presumably. This is Latin, but well attested in Gaul, where it 'concealed' the Celtic element *gabro-s ('goat'). The place-name Capriacum is not anciently attested, but many place-names in France are thought to be derived from it, the most attractive identification being Gevrey-Chambertin (d?p. C?te d'Or) in Burgundy, Gibriacus in 630 and Gebriacus in 858, when its vineyards were already well known: see A. Dauzat and Ch. Rostaing, Dictionnaire ?tymologique des noms de lieu en France (2nd edn., 1978), s.v. Gabriac. 63 Apparently the numeral '9' scored over (as if to delete it), preceded by a reversed C; the other barrel-head (No. 37) includes something similar. Perhaps a batch-number, or to identify the barrel within the shipload. 64 The sequence CVXIS is not possible as a single numeral of capacity, but visually CV and XIS are on slightly different alignments, so they can be taken as two numerals. The contents were evidently thought to be valuable, for such a large total to be noted so precisely. The introduction to RIB II.4, 2442, notes two barrels from Silchester approximately 889 and 930 litres in capacity, and another from London of c. 1050 litres.</page><page sequence="121">R.S.O.

Shallow traces of a branded stamp: DD DD 65 Not an abbreviated name, like many branded stamps (see below, n. 67), but likely to be a Greek name ending in -RAS, probably one of the small group in -agoras such as Hermagoras. 66 The long sinuous line which cuts the I of Sertienses must belong to another graffito, now lost; it is perhaps the top of S, s(emis), in a note of quantity like (iv) on the other barrel-head (No. 36). To the right of Sertienses is apparently a reversed C, followed by V. Perhaps a numerical notation, '5', like (iii) in No. 36. The dolium was a very large earthenware storage jar used for the fermentation and maturing of wine, so the reference here is not to the barrel itself, but to the origin of the wine; in modern terms, to the 'vat' or 'vintage', vetus ('old'), variously abbreviated, is often used in dipinti to qualify wine and other products, and means that they had been allowed to mature before being exported. A likely parallel is the graffito on a small barrel-head from Vindolanda read as DOLVLI in E. Birley, R. Birley and A. Birley, Vindolanda Research Reports, New Series II: The Early Wooden Forts. Reports on the Auxiliaries, the writing tablets, inscriptions, brands and graffiti (1993), 85 (but not illustrated). The addition of a single diagonal stroke to each of the last two letters, whether it has been lost or only overlooked, would make the reading into DOL VET. It was accompanied by 'further graffiti elsewhere'. Sertienses would be the inhabitants of a place-name in Sert- . There is no sure identification, but a possibility is Sers (d?p. Charente) in Aquitaine, derived from serta ('garlands') by Dauzat and Rostaing (see n. 62 above) who cite Sertorovilla (852) and in sertis (923). Sers is c. 15 km south-east of Angoul?me, and thus within the modern appellation of 'Cognac' for the spirit distilled from the local Vin de Charente. 67 For other examples from London of barrel staves branded with the initials of tria nomina, see RIB II.4, 2442.12-14. 68 See previous note.

Rhodes, 'Inscriptions on leather waste from Roman London', Britannia 18 (1987), 173-81. They consist of abbreviated personal names, especially the initials of tria nomina; for other examples from London, see RIB II.4, 2445.13, 29 and 33. 70 This reading, or rather its restoration and expansion, is not certain since dipinti from Gauloise 1 for comparison are unknown, according to F. Laubenheimer, La production des amphores en Gaule Narbonnaise (1985), 399. But compare the dipinti found on a related amphora-type, Gauloise 4 (ibid., 399-403), better published as A. Desbat, R. Lequ?ment, . Liou, 'Inscriptions peintes sur amphores: Lyon et Saint-Romain-en-Gal', Archaeonautica 7 (1987), 141-66. One (LI) in particular reads: AMIN | VET VSIB | IVLI ADIVTORIS, Amin(eum) vet (us) usib(us) Itili Adiutoris. The initial V of VET is of exaggerated form unlike that of VSIB, but resembles V here in lines 1 and 2, which is evidently a notation either for v(etus), Old (wine)', or v(inum), 'wine', if not both. The type of wine, often sp?cifie on Gauloise 4 (Amin(eum), Mas(sicum), etc.), is not stated. There is then a space, between lines 2 and 3. The beginning of 3 is lost, but the uninscribed space further to the left shows that there was no room for the name of a freedman incorporating [L]IB, so read [VS]IB, usib(us), a term explained by Liou (above), who compares CIL xv 4807, usibus cellari Severi, and CIL i 2583 (etc.), v(initm) r(ubriim) in usus Coeliae Proculae, for which Mommsen cites Digest 33, 9, 4, 2 to show that a producer of oil or wine might retain for his own use (usus) a 'reserve' (penus) distinct from his commercial stock. In dipinti, this reference to personal 'use' should be taken to refer to the producer like the termpenuarium (frompenus, see for example RIB II.6, 2492.11), in the sense of his guarantee of quality to the consumer. If the numeral '80' refers to sextarii [43.76 litres], it seems rather large for Gauloise 1, but '60' is found in Gauloise 4 dipinti.</page><page sequence="123">R.S.O. TOMLIN 341 fig. 36.

The last three letters are apparently the numeral '16', but this would be difficult as a note of capacity since the capacity of Dressel 20 amphoras is noted in modii (usually six, seven or eight) and sextarii (of which there were sixteen to the modius).

Since F is excluded by the sequence of letters, it must be E or H. Visually, E is more likely than H. Since the sequence -ARTE- is hardly ever found within a name, A is probably the initial letter, of a name derived from that of the Greek goddess Artemis.

However, it is not a reversed text, and there are no evident anagrams or encipherment. Since the letter-forms are literate, it cannot be a pseudo inscription either.

A downstroke survives from a line above, probably S. In the bottom line, only the upper half of the letters survives: after LS there is a downstroke appropriate to I or perhaps V, and a horizontal stroke appropriate to R or T.

RIB follows Machell, who copied from Dugdale but made mistakes in doing so. Although Machell implies that it was a statue and transcribes the inscription as SANCTO DEO BELATVCADRO, the corresponsion is close enough to identify his stone with Dugdale's. 133 Dugdale uses the the contemporary convention of a suprascript horizontal stroke indicating abbreviation to mark two ligatures, AN and VM. There are many variations in the god's name, but this is the first instance of Belatucatrus. Dugdale is unlikely to have made a mistake for Belatucairus (compare RIB IIA, 1784 and 2056), since he read it correctly in RIB IIA. On the other hand, Machell's Belatucadrus is only a 'correction' derived from the predominant form.

On the west end is this inscription ... LEG: II... AUG F, this taken by the farmer a little time since from the foundations of a square fort to the south of the wall.
