<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Cross of Hosea. By H. WHEELER RoBIN- SON. Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1949. 64 pages. $1.50. This is a posthumous study, edited by Ernest A. Payne, in three chapters: The Marriage of Hosea, The Inwardness of Sin, and The Vic- tory of Grace. The book does not contribute much that is new concerning Hosea. The tradi- tional view with regard to his marriage is accepted, with a significant modification in interpreting "wife of whoredom" (1:2). Gomer was apparently a pure woman when he was wedded to her, but in the course of married life it became apparent that she was possessed of an innate tendency toward harlotry. This finally found its full expression. Hosea is exalted at the expense of his predecessor Amos, and among subsequent prophets closest affin- ities are found in Jeremiah (pp. 14, 19, 40). The book is written in typical English style, with frequent reference to relevant passages in English literature, particularly Shakespeare. The more significant elements are found in the theological contributions, for this is pri- marily a theological treatment of the writings of Hosea. The main theme of the book is the sinfulness of man, and this presentation might be called a trilogy of essays on sin. Stress is placed on the fact that God suffers, and is a "burden bearer," and that Hosea was first to conceive this. Professor Robinson insists that the "suffering of God" must be as real to us as "the love of God" (p. 24). This suffering of God frequently eventuates in a divine joy which apparently can be achieved in no other way (p. 25). By contrast with the general attempt to emancipate ourselves from anthropomorph- ism, Professor Robinson conceives of "the higher anthropomorphism" which stresses the fundamental likeness "between the human and divine personality" (pp. 20-21). The study comes to a climax in its special attention to the cross of Hosea in comparison with the cross of Christ (p. 51). ROLLAND E. WOLFE Western Reserve University</page></plain_text>
