<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK DEPARTMENT in better perspective if a careful study were made of "Old Americans" to deter- mine just how European they are. It would be found that though they are re- moved several generations from Europe, they are actually European-Americans, cul- turally speaking. Many of their sayings, beliefs, philosophies, superstitions, cultural misconceptions, moral standards, and cus- toms are still European in part. The only difference between them and "others" is a matter of degree. America asks of the re- cent arrival something that first arrivals have not accomplished. Some of the data in this book were col- lected by people trained not in sociology but in other fields. Social phenomena are complex, quite as complex as the phenom- ena in other fields. It takes just as much training to do sociological research as it does to do research in astronomy, geology, or any other science. If this is not true, why maintain our large Departments of Sociology? People needed to be put to work during the depression, but why should sociology give its critics concrete evidence to establish their belief that anyone is qual- ified to study and interpret social relation- ships and human nature? L. GUY BROWN Oberlin College HARVARD TERCENTENARY PUBLICATION. Factors Determining Human Behavior. Pp. vii, 168. Cambridge, Mass.: Har- vard University Press, 1937. $2.50. This admirable and stimulating little vol- ume attempts to present the basic struc- tural, psychological, and, to some extent, cultural properties which condition or im- pel human conduct. It is a symposium to which each specialist presents the ultimate distillation of his matured views, simplified and generalized for the educated layman. Moreover, its essential aim is to make a contribution to the general synthesis of the data of various disciplines which bear on man, and to focus the results of diverse but significantly related sciences upon the task of interpreting the behavior of the individ- ual and the social institutions under which he lives. To this end, and in the following order, Adrian treats the nervous system; Collip, the hormones; Piaget, the intellec- tual evolution from childhood to adult life; J ung, the psychological factors determining human bellavior (too heavily freighted for my taste with improbable hypotheses and literary metaphors of his particular cult of psychoanalysis, offered as established facts); Janet, psychological strength and weakness in mental diseases; Carnap, logic (one of the most urbane and skillful of the collection); Lowell, an example from evi- dence of history (an analogy to show, by way of the evolution of the English parlia- mentary system, that, in the universal process of functional adaptation, institu- tions, like organisms, may assume forms not originally intended); and, finally, Mal- inowski, culture as a determinant of be- havior. The contributions of Lowell and Mali- nowski, since they emphasize rather heav- ily the institutional aspect, would seem to some rather incongruous with the rest of the miscellany, which is essentially con- cerned with the individual. In my opin- ion this is not a defect, and more would have been better, since I consider social factors to be more potent in shaping the individual psychologically than are the in- nate structural endowments and instincts with which he starts life. These latter are but an amorphous hint, with infinite possi- bilities depending upon the social environ- ment to a major degree. Functions so presumably innate as intelligence are now known to be subject to vitamins and cul- tural conditions. It might be suggested that the funda- mental viewpoint of the editors involves the fallacious nineteenth-century assump- tion that as the parts are logically primary, they must necessarily be so empirically. This view has determined the policy of organization and order of material. While no such intention may have been active, nevertheless this progression from the smaller unit to the larger whole implies a repudiation, or at least a disregard, of the principle of syncretism which has led to so much productive work in Gestalt psychol- ogy and in anthropology. Genetically and psychologically the cultural matrix is pri- mary, and the individual is to be derived from it, and not it from the individual. It would be strange not to notice that 263</page><page sequence="2">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY some of the symposiasts had not listened very attentively to each other. Carnap, the logician, quite properly admonishes us against confusing fancies and wishes with data and legitimate inferences; nevertheless, Malinowski, setting out to demonstrate the existence of a "science of culture," neglects this caution, and before long is launched on a polemic in behalf of the kind of social institutions he prefers. With his principal thesis that culture as a dynamic reality is subject to determinism and emerges from the mode of life, there can be only the heartiest assent, although the stress on this commonly conceded point resembles the flogging of a dead horse. But elsewhere one is chilled by the ease with which his distaste for machines leads him to regard them as anthropomorphic monsters. He remains quite impervious to the possibility that not the machine, but the uses to which it is put, as in war, and the mode of eco- nomic control to which it is subjected, may be monstrous. Moreover, he so conducts a triumphant polemic, with Briffault as his unacknowledged antagonist, on behalf of his theory of the family, as to leave the im- pression that The Mothers had never been written. It is also disturbing to find him resorting to threadbare pseudo-psychologi- cal banalities in support of the grim tradi- tion of economic competition. These excursions make one more aware of his lim- itations as a psychologist than of his very distinguished accomplishments as an an- thropologist. But these defects in an oth- erwise admirably vigorous and engaging paper do not mar the general tone of amity which should mark such a celebration and its Festschrift. Man considered retrospectively is well clone throughout the book as a whole. But there is a hesitation to estimate, in terms of the already discernible features of society, what the future conduct of man is likely to become. To me it is regrettable that the Harvard authorities did not see fit to suggest this as part of the assignment of the symposiasts. An excellent oppor- tunity to make this hazardous but lauda- ble venture has been overlooked here. If nothing more, some Harvard alumni would have been grateful no end to know how future Doctors of Public Service and of In- dustrial Coordination, which Harvard will undoubtedly turn out in great numbers during the next three hundred years, will regard our Masters of Business Administra- tion who have but little comprehension of the social implications of business. Will they regard us with the same patronage as we sometimes show toward the founders of Harvard, whose only concern was to insure a supply of ministers? ELLIS FREEMlIAN Sarasota, Florida SARTON, GEORGE. The History of Science and the New IHumanism. Pp. xx, 196. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1937. $2.00. Here is an excellent little book which combines the enthusiasm of the scientist with the background of the historian. Those who have followed Dr. Sarton's work in compending a biographical bibliog- raphy of the history of science from as far back as we can know, will welcome this bit of work, which is, as it were, an apology for the former. The principal thesis is that the scientist needs to be more "human" and the humanist to be more scientific. Humanism and science should not follow different trails, as they have been wont to do. If all progress is really based on science, then the humanist's principal prob- lem is to humanize science, and this is best done by a history of the way in which the needs of man have driven him to science in order to meet them. Practically speak- ing, no student of a science should continue his studies without a history of his particu- lar problem, and such a history would be- come intelligible only as a particular exam- ple of notions common to all science. For the philosopher, this thesis seems rather worn. No student of philosophy would ever dream of doing constructive work on a problem without having thor- oughly reviewed its history. Even though he is fully aware that a certain problem has never had a satisfactory answer, he is no less aware that without realizing the causes of failure, he can make no progress in its solution. But it would seem that this is not the case with the average scientist. Indeed, he seems to be almost entirely un- aware of one age in the history of science, 264</page></plain_text>
