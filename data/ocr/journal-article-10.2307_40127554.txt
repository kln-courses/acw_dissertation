<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sigitas Geda, Magician and Minstrel By RIMVYDAS SILBAJORIS The Lithuanians like to say that theirs is a land of song. The country's ancient folklore heritage transmits both its mythology and its sense of beauty in a great variety of songs, but it has not passed down to us a single coherent epic narrative. There has always been a strong lyrical strain also in the tradition of written literature, where the genre of poetry quite often dominated both drama and prose. Therefore, no one has been astonished to see that even in the present period of Soviet occupation the poets have come to the forefront after 1956, when, due to Krushchev's "thaw," it again became possible to create authentic art with some small degree of freedom. In the first few years, poets like Algimantas Baltakis, Vladas Mozuriunas, Justinas Marcinkevicius, and particularly the Lenin prize winner Eduardas Miezelaitis, started to shift their poetic language away from the leaden tongue of Stalinist propaganda toward experimentation with form and style, and toward individual themes which stood apart from the "collective will of the masses." These writers were soon joined by younger talents, among them Janina Degutyte, Judita Vaiciunaite, Albinas Bernotas and others, who took a further step toward more sophisticated poetry, being particu- larly anxious to achieve a true correspondence between their art and their own personal integrity. In the context of the Soviet state, this inward movement toward sincerity and truth produced an appearance of alienation from the official values imposed upon society by the regime. One such value, the so-called "proletarian internationalism," which in practice translates as Russification of the various small Soviet nationalities, stood in particularly sharp conflict with the intimate world of national identity which these Lithuanian poets discovered while seeking their own individual voice. The result was that in remaining true to their art, they also became the spokesmen of their people's resistance to Soviet pressures.</page><page sequence="2">702 BOOKS ABROAD This new role had its effect on both the form and the content of their poetry. The search for an authentic Lithuanian poetic idiom led to the wellsprings of folk art; the basic structures of metaphorical expression in folk songs and legends pointed to an underlying all-but-forgoten dimension of ancient native myth. The poets found that the image of their country in its present situation could be articulated most pro- foundly when encoded in the terms of this mythology. Unprecedented urbanization and industrial development also challenged poets to find new verbal structures which would withstand these pressures and preserve national identity in the changing face of Lith- uania. Judita Vaiciunaite, and particularly the young and highly talented poet Tomas Venclova, met this challenge successfully and produced highly complex, intellectual and sophisicated poetry fully capable of expanding the dimensions of the national spirit to receive the "body and pressure" of the modern age. Sigitas Geda can best be understood in the context of this new Lithuanian poetry. He is both Arcadian and modern, mythological and intellectual, and most of all pro- foundly Lithuanian in his espousal of the nature-oriented native poetic tradition and in his practice of confronting the new challenges to the national cultural identity. The complex balances and juxtapositions of all these elements in Geda's work constitute one aspect of his special, personal quality as a poet. Even more important is the peculiar tilt of his imagination, a tendency to visualize people, landscapes and even thoughts and feelings in the shapes and colors of a world which a child might see before he learns the true correspondences between things and their properties, or else, in the world of a magician's vision which sees beyond appearances to other, unheard-of laws that truly govern the relationship among all things in the universe. In his first book, Pedos (Footprints, 1966), Lithuania appears to Geda all "red and green and hump- backed like a crab," where he was "born one day / when the hedgehogs mowed the hay," and where, "in primeval water," stand "brown reeds, / Smelling of forefathers' bodies." In this land, the sparrows look like buds, the bird nests "float loosely in the sky," and the trees and bushes "stand like weeping little mannikins." The last poem in this collection fairly summarizes Geda's vision of his land: I walked out into Lithuania. There were birds, women and wind. All the cows walked towards day, And a large - brown - meadowlark Fluttered and flapped in the wind. Long wings and whisking rivers, And all the women - butterflies, My eyes grew over with grass, And from the very depths of the grass Animals turned red. Was I there or wasn't I, Or did I dream a clay dream? (Translated by Jonas Zdanys) Such poetry has the dreamlike naivete of a mythmaker, but Geda is not actually creat-</page><page sequence="3">SILBAJORIS 703 ing a mythology in the sense of ascribing anthropomorphic qualities to natural phe- nomena so they could act out human conflicts and harmonies among themselves. What he does is to name his own feelings as things in nature in an effort to recognize some hidden kinship between the individual consciousness and the surrounding universe. When a meadowlark grows beyond measure and becomes identical with the wind, it acquires the quality of a mythical being. Geda's imagination, however, conceives this only as a hyperbolical statement expressing the poet's joy at the wide and windy spaces of his land. The type of poetic perception which permits the special logic of grass grow- ing out of one's own eyes creates the basis of conceiving oneself as one of the "limbs" of the total body of life, interchangeable with and of the same essence as any other. Geda considers his state of being, these "dreams of clay," to be a peculiarly Lithuanian quality of life, and he celebrates it in his art. The skyward movement of the imagina- tion - the gigantic soaring wings of the meadowlark - juxtaposed to the organic, ele- mental feeling of consciousness growing out of the earth describes the parameters of Geda's poetic universe in his first book. He realizes such opposition in several different images. In one poem, for instance, we find a yellow butterfly which "covered the forest with its wing"; there too the poet's fatherland "flutters in open spaces like a flag" and, most importantly, the Lithuanian painter Ciurlionis is "walking between the earth and sky." Ciurlionis (1875-1911) often painted deeply symbolic, semi-abstract landscapes which had the look of a pensive fairy tale. Some of Geda's poetry has a certain affinity with Ciurlionis, but there is also another element in it, a certain coarse-grained cheer- fulness, a naive peasant primitivism combined with a restless, loving vagabond spirit. Geda's imagination, tilting toward mythological perceptions and toward the blending of man and nature, sought a different human figure to be placed between earth and heaven, one which could bring together myth and love in a rough simplicity of heart. Such a man is eulogized in Geda's second book of verse, Strazdas (1967; see BA 43:3, pp. 479-80) . Antanas Strazdas is the name of a Lithuanian poet-priest who lived and wrote in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. His reputation was not always the best; some accused him of unorthodox social behavior, and even of an uncertain alle- giance to celibacy, but his greatest virtue, a warm, sunny love for the poor peasants on the land, outshone all his "sins." This identification with the lower classes, plus his rather casual attitude toward the demands of his priestly calling caused Strazdas diffi- culties with the church authorities and put upon him the mark of a suspicious maverick who might even be insane. Just such a person was close to Geda's heart, and in his poetic vision Geda transformed him into a mythical man-bird, covering the poor, enslaved countryside with the great green shadow of his wings of love. As Geda describes it, the moment of transformation comes at the confluence of three forces: the magic hidden in the microcosm of grass and shady hollows under the trees, the song of a thrush (the name "Strazdas" means "thrush" in Lithuanian) and a sharp pang of pity for the plain folk, a pity which is metaphorically conveyed through the bird's song. From this moment on, the priest-bird-poet Strazdas travels across the land, speaking, consoling, singing, spreading his love, both earthly and divine. Con- tinuing and transforming in himself the images of the previous book: the meadowlark, the flag, Strazdas rises over the horizon like some mystical farmer-demigod:</page><page sequence="4">704 BOOKS ABROAD Those bumblebees humming, This might of the ages, Over tumbledown villages Eternity glows. Come, twilight, unfold, Show me ages gone by - With his wings spread aloft Strazdas tills Lithuania. There are lambs in the meadows. Rivers flowing. The hills. In the sky, wondrously, Blooming sun, flowering god. The surface texture of Geda's verse in this book is very plain, reminiscent of the simplicity and of a certain emotionally very expressive "awkwardness" of line in the old Lithuanian roadside carvings of religious figures. The subtlety and depth of the message this language contains can be perceived only when we understand what lives behind the seeming naivete of Geda's imagery. Thus, in the poem above, the juxta- position of bumblebees and the "might of the ages" may strike one at first as a rather amateurish attempt at encompassing both microcosm and macrocosm in two brief lines. The key to the image, however, lies in the quality of the emotional associations which these two expressions possess in Lithuanian. "The might of the ages" is not an ele- vated, Biblical locution; it is rather a common turn of speech among simple folk, de- noting a person's sense of humility and awe in the presence of some overwhelming power. Consequently, the unprepossessing "bumblebees" - a term which carries lyrical and bucolic associations in Lithuanian poetry- begins to signify such a person in itself, becomes a symbol of the quintessential Lithuanian peasant from the days of serfdom, gathering the honey of his humble labor through the endless flow of generations. Against such a background, the figure of Strazdas, continuing the image of the bee in the flight of another, mythical figure, expands and soars upward to confront the eternity of time with the poetic force of love. The basic trend of Geda's imagery in Strazdas is toward the unification of man and nature in an effort to describe in poetic terms the over-all continuum of life. Strazdas himself, mythical and real, together with the long-suffering Lithuanian serfs and with every living thing on the land they till for themselves and for their alien masters, become but different facets, configurations, in that continuum. Such a view of life con- stitutes an underlying premise in all of Geda's poetry. It is developed in a much more sophisticated manner, in poetic language of great complexity, in his next book, 26 rudens ir vasaros giesmes (26 Songs of Autumn and Summer; see BA 47*3, p. 597), published in 1972. Here the plain verbal fabric of the earlier books is replaced with a rich tapestry of words describing many shades of feeling and subtle variations in shapes and colors. The topic throughout is nature rather than a particular person, or even a particular country. Nevertheless, in this book Geda is much more than a mere painter of landscapes. He drives on to the very edge of death in his attempt to penetrate deep into the mystery of life, perceived as the mystery of an individual consciousness. This is not a philosophical quest, but rather a movement through various stages and aspects</page><page sequence="5">SILBAJORIS 705 of awareness toward some deep level of identity with all living things in a dimension of being where ordinary reality acquires the cast of myth, and where death itself, with- out losing its unfathomable finality, nevertheless becomes an intimate attribute of the continuum of life. In essence, it is a striving for some special knowledge - a knowledge which can give control over a person's own awareness that he exists (ordinarily, we are quite helpless before this overwhelming fact) and thus can give control over both the secret of life and the secret of death. Geda is striving toward the dimension of magic; in this way he follows the original, primeval impulse of all art. Imitating the seer, the magician, in his chosen medium of poetry, Geda operates, as the magician does, with a series of substitutions which comprise a special code - a verbal universe wherein resides the secret of mastery by the imagination over inert reality, that is, the vicarious experience of creation. Geda's substitutions are those of natural phenomena - plants, inanimate objects, landscapes, visions of the sea - for vari- ous nuances of emotion, for differing shapes of thought. As all these things acquire their new functions, as they become the outlines of the poet's mind, they are subjected to a great pressure of metaphorization which forces them to "give up" some of their natural integrity, to share their properties with other things, to the point where they seem to "run together," to blend into new sets of patterns, governed by new laws of imagery which permit the fusion of the author's own consciousness, his "soul," with the general design. At this level of transformation it becomes possible, even natural, that a mythical figure should emerge from the landscape, as if it were a new configura- tion of the existing elements- a "Mute One of the Plants," or a "Bull out of the Sea"- the transfigured essence of the poet himself, his image as the Magician. As an example of some of the things Geda strives for in this book, we may look at the following poem: Sixth Song You enchant, bluebottle's abyss that none will let my soul enter: sand lips, a plant like fire You hold in darkness, nestle in your palms, lilac earth . . . In an animal's print there is a green spirit, - she casts spells, the ocean bottom's frothy, - he sees and renews, and with a blue Voice a pigeon speaks, - sometimes a man . . . The girl turns her thin beak toward a fluttering snail . . . I hear a timid swallow pant . . .</page><page sequence="6">706 BOOKS ABROAD The ocean's masked bottom draws near: the world, - just one, and the spirit - imperceptible . . . An oval - his red embrace . . . You're born, and moonlight's white strength envelops you, until you return again to a young month, to a wide ocean isle . . . She grows and spreads. None know this thing's secret . . . {Translated from the Lithuanian by Jonas Zdanys) Space does not permit an analysis of this poem, but we may note both the tendency of all phenomena to blend into one another (hands and earth, grass and "green spirit," bird and girl) and the consistent lines of imagery, holding firm through the trans- figurations, curving toward the ultimate mystery of being, which is an oval shape (earth's orbit, bird's egg, smooth pebbles of the sea, givers of birth to man, bird and girl) that burns in the sun and is cast over by the pale light of the magic moon. It strikes the reader that Geda is not a symbolist in the conventional sense- his images (like the blue voice of the pigeon) are based not on the presumption of some hidden mystical correspondences, but rather on visual effects (the color of the bird, the blue - oval? - vault of the sky) enriched and transformed by an inner sense of recognition of the unity of all things, of which the poem is the voice. In a recent cycle of poems called "The Blossoms of the Night," Geda returns to a central human figure, in some ways reminiscent of the Lithuanian vagabond-priest Strazdas. The subtitle of this group of poems is "Seven Dedications to Francois Villon." The fifteenth-century scholar of the University of Paris, a wandering minstrel, thief, lover and companion of gallow-birds had in him just the combination of poetic fancy, rebellion, human sympathy and sorrow, despondency and sarcasm which appeals to Geda's restless, essentially romantic, heart. It appears that the lonely magician of "26 Songs" considers himself a member of human society, yet because of his poetic gift, he belongs to the fraternity of the condemned. Nevertheless, these seven dedications to Villon remain far enough removed from their subject to escape the maudlin nostalgia and the fallacy of a close personal identification. Geda understands that, at least in one crucial respect - that of intimate relationship with nature - he is a far different man from Villon. A non-Lithuanian reader who looks at Lithuanian literature may find in this difference another confirmation of the Arcadian nature of its poetry which, like a screen, filters and modifies even the latest troubled urban complexities which have finally reached this nation. In this cycle Geda remains the same poet of nature, of subtle shifts of mood and perception mirrored upon the green face of the earth, as he was in the preceding book. All he does is to choose from Villon's life and poetry a number of specific themes, images and biographical experiences which he then incorporates into a</page><page sequence="7">SILBAJORIS 707 poetic design entirely his own. There is, for instance, a poem called "The Eating of the Chicken" which refers directly to the time Villon supposedly spent with "la grosse Margot," an innkeeper-prostitute, as her accomplice and disgusted lover. In Geda's poem the relationship between the two is interpreted as a kind of cannibalism, where the sexual act turns into a sarcastic orgy of drunken gluttony. Another poem, "The Song of the Time of Pestilence," points to Villon's travels across the plague-ravaged France of his day, but the specific imagery soon transforms the landscape into rural Lithuania. Other references are more remote, more completely assimilated into Geda's own poetic universe. Villon's unhappy love, Catherine de Vausselles - his "chiere rose"- becomes a black rose, an image of death and love in the first of Geda's poems; the famous line "mais ou sont les neiges d'antan" from "Ballade des dames du temps jadis" finds a faint echo in the same poem as an image of sand and snow (these two are closely re- lated in Geda's poetic transformations), and the gallows song "Ballade des Pendus" moves like a shadow through several of the dedications, dwelling a while longer in Geda's refrain, "kiss the skull and fear not death," in the poem called "Seven-Line Stanzas on Mute Perdition." Still further removed from direct connection with Villon, but faithful to his spirit, as well as to Geda's own, is the nostalgic, pensive mood of the poems, the intimate relation between death and love, youth and oblivion, lyrical beauty and an occasional grotesque Rabelaisian merriment. Perhaps the general feeling of the poems can be perceived in the following stanzas from the first dedication: Fate will again be kind to me: I'll find her stretched out on sand, - the darkest rose, because September's snows, because my snow palace is a frame of dust; I brought myself a skull and a rose and fell asleep on searocks, because black flames began to devour the joy and happiness of passed days, clear existence . . . Fate will again be kind to me: There, you and the sea, sleeping in sand, and a black bird stiffened on your breasts, and trees' poison, and a road song fading as earth's pilgrims pass; I lifted the skull, filled it with dark poison, yearning for evening's cup, great nights, there above old Rome the blossom of my love will glow, clear existence . . . (Translated from the Lithuanian by Jonas Zdanys) It was said before that Geda seeks control of the consciousness of being in the manner of a magician. But perhaps "control" is not the right word, although neither is "magic." The special mystery woven into Geda's rich, medieval gobelin of words, the key to all images, all transformations of men and things into myth, the ultimate spring of inspiration is simply love.
