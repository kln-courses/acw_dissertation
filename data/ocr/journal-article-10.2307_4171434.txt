<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Cycle of Gandhara HE ruined shells of monasteries on the savage, hilly terrain over Peshawar, the mountainous stupas seen in the defiles of the Khyber Pass and rising from the dusty plain of Jelalabad, Taxila, the ancient city south of the black banks of the Indus at Attock, and the gutted rock-cut temples at Bamiyan under the Hindu Kush- these are only some of the sources of the sculpture of Gandhara which flourished nearly two thousand years ago in northwestern Pakistan and Afghanistan. The term Gandhara art was first loosely applied to describe the sculpture in a provincial Graeco-Roman style that was first discovered in the ruins of Buddhist establishments centered around modern Peshawar. The haphazard excavations begun more than a century ago in what is today northwestern Pakistan filled whole galleries of the British Museum and its counterparts in British India with an enormous quantity of slate carvings that upon discovery were joyfully recognized as reflections of the Hellenic taste in the territories of the Raj. The famous collection at Lahore, the "House of Wonders," formed the dramatic setting for a chapter in Kipling's Kim. Although a hundred years ago the art of Gandhara was at first excessively praised by the pioneers of Indian archaeology as an illustration of classical art in the Orient, the chauvinistic critics of our own century dismissed the entire school as an unwel- come intrusion of debased Western taste into the sacred stream of Indian art. A more sober evaluation somewhere between these extremes would point out that although unquestionably much of Gandhara sculpture is oppressively ugly and dull, the finer pieces reveal very much the same hieratic transformation of classical art that we admire in Early Christian and Byzantine sculpture. At the same time this strange hybrid combination of Western and Indian ideals made a number of contributions of immeasurable value to the iconography of Buddhist art and its later stylistic development over all of Asia. Although the province of Gandhara, known to the ancients and once a satrapy of the Achaemenid empire, was limited geographically to the region of southern Afghanistan below Jelalabad, the Swat and Buner Valleys, and the territory south and east of Peshawar to the Indus and Taxila, the name Gandhara is used to describe the school of Indo-Roman art which flourished in the terrain extending from Taxila in the Punjab to include all of northwestern Pakistan, the Kabul Valley, and northern Afghanistan between the Hindu Kush and the Oxus. The Gandhara school of art, perhaps beginning under the Indo-Parthian rulers of the first century A.D., was the specific creation of the Indo-Scythian or Kushan dynasty, which ruled a great empire II4</page><page sequence="2">extending roughly from the Aral Sea to the Indus in the first centuries of the Christian era. Although, as revealed by their coinage and inscriptions, the religion of the Kushan emperors was evidently a syncretic combination of elements drawn from Graeco-Roman, Iranian, and Indian sources, these sovereigns, notably the famous Kanishka, were fervent patrons of Buddhism. The cosmopolitan nature of Kushan society accounts at once for the synthetic character of their religious attachments and the Western aspects of Gandhara art. Although future excavations may reveal a connection between the origins of this school and the lost art of Hellenistic Bactria, all the evidence available at the moment seems to point to the conclusion that this school of art, literally invented for Buddhist usage under the Kushans, was brought into being as the direct result of the relationships - economic, diplomatic, and artistic - between the rulers of the great Kushan dynasty and their Roman counter- parts, Augustus and his successors. More than one embassy from the Kushans reached the court of Augustus. The Indo-Scythian emperors based their gold coinage on the Roman aureus, and on an issue of Kujula Kadphises appears a likeness of Octavian himself.' The trade between India and the Roman world from the first century on- ward moved both by overland and maritime routes.2 The commerce by sea grew enormously by the exploitation of the monsoon winds under Claudius, and Roman trading stations were established on both the west and east coasts of India.3 As dramatically revealed by the artifacts of every description found in the treasure of Begram, Alexandria was the principal source for the export of luxury goods to India and Central Asia.4 As will be related below, there is reason to believe that this Graeco-Roman capital strongly influenced certain aspects of the style and technique of Gandhara sculpture as well. Together with its exchange of material wealth be- tween Rome and the Kushan empire, there is every reason to believe that craftsmen trained in the pagan workshops of the Mediterranean had a part in the formation of the Gandhara school. The resemblance between the types and techniques of Gandhara and Roman sculpture are often so close that it must be assumed that, at least in the beginnings of the school, the craftsmen who decorated the monastic establishments in the hills of Peshawar were either journeymen sculptors from the Roman empire itself or artisans who had had some direct contact with prototypes in the Roman world. There is nothing comparable in all of art history to this wholesale imposition of a foreign style on a native school - unlike the intrusion of European elements into Mughal art or the Western influence on Japanese artists in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries which were very quickly assimilated into the indigenous tradi- tions. In Gandhara the way had been prepared for this invasion of Western techniques and ideas through the creation of a climate of Greek taste in Asia by the Hellenistic Bactrian culture of Alexander's successors and by the later Indo-Greek kings who were finally displaced by the Kushans in the first century B.C. There are only sparse indications of the existence of any Buddhist art in Gandhara before the advent of the Indo-Scythians, so that in a way this Indo-Roman school filled an artistic void. It was suddenly and rapidly brought into being by the Kushans as part of their intensive patronage of Buddhism which began at least as early as the reign of Kanishka.s If Gandhara art was obviously created to please the taste of a population sympathetic II5</page><page sequence="3">to Graeco-Roman ideals, it cannot be answered categorically whether this was an inheritance from the earlier Graeco-Bactrian tradition in Afghanistan or the result of close ties with the Roman cultural orbit. This small-scale imitation of Roman grandeur must also have appeared as a suitable background for the royal Kushan patrons and the Buddhist clergy. It must be borne in mind that, except possibly for the colossi at Bamiyan which belong to a relatively late period, everything in Gand- hara art is on a small scale. Even in the largest stOpas and viharas the overall effect was achieved by the superficial application of many relatively small statues and reliefs, so that the result was not markedly different from the accumulation of many little figures and panels in the decoration of the earlier stupas of Saiichi and Bharhut.6 The reliefs and statues of Gandhara are carved in a variety of stones available in northwestern Pakistan and Afghanistan. These include blue, grey, and green schist, phyllite, limestone, and soapstone. These carvings formed the revetment of stOpas and viharas in the countless religious establishments both north and south of the Khyber Pass. Many of the reliefs were regularly employed to decorate the risers of i. Standing Buddha. Black slate. Gandhara, 2nd century A.D. H. 74 inches.

Originally the stone was provided with a polychrome decoration, and one piece from Taxila in the Karachi Museum retains traces of an application of gold leaf.7 Except for those early examples which reveal an unmistakable classical touch, probably through the intervention of Western craftsmen, the majority of Gandhara stone sculptures are marked by a dull mediocrity of carving, dry and mechanical in execution. They give the impression, both by their numbers and style, of a mass production, in which the stonecutters hacked out carvings based on earlier models or copybooks without the least understanding of, or sensitivity for what they were producing. THE examples of Gandhara sculpture in the Museum's collection furnish us with a rather complete survey, stylistic as well as chronological, of the development of this Indo-Roman school by the way in which these carvings faithfully reflect styles of art in Rome and the eastern provinces of the empire from the first century A.D. through the Severid period. The later history of the Gandhara school is marked, however, by the gradual absorption of the imported classical ideals into a native Indian idiom. Gandhara sculpture illustrates a process repeated many times in the history of art, whereby preexisting types and techniques were adopted for the creation of new forms without regard for the context of the prototype. A case in point is the Buddha image. Without entering into a discussion of the endless polemic regarding the priority of the Roman or Indian prototype, it can be stated that the earliest Gandhara images were made presumably during the reign of Kanishka and, like the first repre- sentations of Christ in human shape, were based on a variety of forms already in II7</page><page sequence="5">4. &amp; 5. Head of a Buddha. Micaceous slate. Gandhara, 2nd century A.D. or later. H. 9s/ inches. Gift of Mr. Denmtian W. Ross. 19.802 existence in the repertory of pagan art of the Mediterranean world. The example in the Museum's collection (Fig. i), most likely a fragment of a large relief, is a typical early example of the Buddha image in Gandhara. The youthful countenance, crowned by wavy locks, shows an obvious resemblance to the Apollo type of Late Hellenistic art (Fig. 2)8, and the robe, arranged in voluminous folds clearly revealing the form and movement of the body, is used to depict the sanghati in the style of the weighty drapery of Roman sculpture of the early Imperial period (Fig. 3).9 As has been stated many times before, the Buddha was first represented in human form in response to a devotional need, just as in Early Christian art the image of Christ re- placed his earlier portrayal in symbolical form.10 Mahayana Buddhism flourished in Gandhara as it did in Andhradesa, perhaps even as early as the second century of our era, but the decoration of the viharas of the Northwest Frontier appears to have been dedicated largely to Hinayana ideals. Although even at this time Buddha was prob- ably conceived as a divinized being, it is still the mortal Sakyamuni who is repre- sented both in statues and in the countless relief sculptures devoted to episodes from his life and earlier incarnations. Since many of the sculptors active in Gandhara from the second century onward were Indian, it was inevitable that, although instructed to work in the imported classical style, they intuitively introduced elements of Indian technique and iconog- II8</page><page sequence="6">6.

Gift of the Estate of Dana Estes. 10.76 raphy, a circumstance which eventually led to the absorption of Gandhara art into the mainstream of Indian sculpture. It was this late, and essentially Indianized, and even abstract type of Buddha and Bodhisattva image that spread eastward over Central Asia to China." The head of Buddha in the Museum collection (Figs. 4 &amp; 5) is an illustration of this process. Although it retains reminiscences of the classical style, it demonstrates the Indianization of an original Apollonian type. In a typically Indian way there is an emphasis on the spheroidal mass of the head. The face, like the later masks of Buddha in the Gupta period,12 is composed of smooth, uninter- rupted surfaces, a treatment that automatically imposed an abstract, rather than humanistic beauty on the conception. The hair, defined by a web of lines incised on the surface, still suggests an original Graeco-Roman convention, but the decorative formalization and the revelation of the usnisa as a recognizable cranial protuberance are more Indian than classic. It is not surprising either that the rather cold and dry impression created by this head may remind us of Palmyrene sculpture (Fig. 6).13 This is a parallel in India of the same fusion of Oriental and classic elements that produced the spiritualized grave portraits of Zenobia's capital. Another autonomous creation of the Gandhara school was the Bodhisattva image, represented by a magnificent example in the Museum collection (Fig. 7). Although occasional representations of the divine Bodhisattvas of the Mahayana pantheon II9</page><page sequence="7">7. Bodhisattva. Slate. Gandhara, 2nd century A.D. H. 43 inches.

Francis Bartlett Collection. 23.1 have been found, the great majority of Bodhisattva statues from Gandhara are to be identified simply as representations of Siddhartha, the Buddha as prince before his Enlightenment, and Maitreya, the Buddha of the future. The Bodhisattvas are in- variably represented as rajahs wearing the turban and dhoti and bedecked with a splendid harness of necklaces and bangles. Their majestic formal bearing and rich ornamentation served to give the impression of a royal presence in symbolical form. The portrait-like character of some of these images suggests the possibility that, just as it was the custom in Cambodia in later centuries, these figures may be re- garded as portrayals of earthly princes embodied in the guise of their heavenly counterparts.I4 The style of these Gandhara Bodhisattva statues, as illustrated by the present I20</page><page sequence="8">example, is a strange pastiche of Indian and foreign elements. Like many Gandhara Buddha images, their rigid frontality suggests Iranian Parthian antecedents. Various parts of the costume relate to Western models, so that, for example, the universal convention present in our statue of representing the skirt in a series of stiff swallow- tail folds repeats a favored device of the Roman archaistic style (Fig. 8).I5 At the same time the reduction of the individual folds to sharp ridges suggests the formalized ab- straction of the classical garment in the sculpture of Palmyra. The completely realistic representation of details ofjewelry had been anticipated in the earlier Indian schools, but at the same time this technique reminds us of the precise description of orna- ments in the sculpture of Palmyra.I6 The head of this Bodhisattva, like the Buddha type, is reminiscent of the Graeco-Roman Apollo, and in the present example the krobylos or topknot duplicates the familiar coiffure of the Apollo Belvedere (Fig. 2).I7 From the point of view of anatomical modeling, even the best Gandhara Bodhi- sattvas display a completely inorganic combination of the parts of the body that is neither Indian nor Graeco-Roman, lacking the fullness of the Indian ideal and the supple articulation of the Hellenic style. The bodies of the Gandhara Bodhisattvas strike us as formalized effigies rather than living organisms with a suggestion of the same hieratic abstraction of the human frame that appears in Roman provincial sculpture and is the ultimate source of the patternized, rather than humanistic, treatment of man in medieval art. It is true of all Gandhara sculpture that only in the occasional pagan figures in reliefs, of which the sculptor was either a Westerner or had a direct classical model before him, do we find representations of the human body as a truly organically articulated body comparable to the classical ideal. There was obviously no direct prototype in classical art for the Bodhisattva figures, so that they are invariably a mixture of classical details overlaid on the earlier Indian formula for the representa- tion of yakshas and devas.I8 In the field of relief sculpture the art of Gandhara presents a succession of styles and techniques which are faithful reflections of successive stages in the evolution of relief carving in the Roman empire. The earliest Gandhara reliefs, especially those devoted to pagan themes, are local variants of the style of the Augustan and Flavian periods, in which the figures in the friezes are isolated against a plain background in what is an ultimate reflection of the relief style of the great period of Greece.I9 The Antonine revival of the Hellenistic style, with its deep pictorial undercutting and wildly dynamic expression of movement and pathos, makes its appearance in the complex Gandhara carvings of the mid-second century.20 In their formulation of the sculptural representations of the Buddha's life story the sculptors of Gandhara abandoned the earlier mode of continuous narration in favor of the Roman method of narrative sculpture in which a separate panel is dedicated to each episode of the hero's life. Whereas in the early Classic art of India, as in the carvings of Bharhut and SanchT, espisodes from the Buddha story were represented in haphazard fashion and with only a symbolical indication of Sakyamuni's presence, in the reliefs of Gandhara we encounter for the first time a regular iconography for all the major events. The Gandhara sculptors in devising this systematic pictorial narrative per- formed very much the same service as Giotto did at Assisi in providing and codifying 121</page><page sequence="9">9.

Certain GandhMra reliefs, like the ornamented door jambs in our collection (Figs. 9 &amp; io), show the un- mistakable introduction of a Roman technique that evolved in the period of the Severids in which the figures in their enframement are so deeply undercut as to give the impression of a reticulated screen of ornament, j'ust as may be seen in the second and third century carvings at Baalbek and Leptis Magna (Fig. i i). A favorite motif, beautifully illustrated in our panel, is the inhabited vine (Fig. 0).2 1 The spiraling vine pattern, sometimes filled with bird and animal forms and generally issuing from the mouth of a makara, had a long history as an emblem of vegetative creation in early Indian art,2 but this design is quite separate from the type of ornament evolved in Rome in which the grape tendrils form a series of medallions for the accommoda- tion of human and animal figures. In the example in the Boston Museum the roundels are filled with Dionysian scenes, the exact import of which in a Buddhist setting is rather difficult to explain. It is possible that they are present as symbolic references to bacchic elements in the cult of the yaksha Kuvera .23 The outer border of the panel in the Museum collection combining dogtooth, bead and reel, and an imbricated laurel and wreath motif has many close parallels in the decorative sculpture of Palmyra of the second and third centuries2 ThIahe r crigothvInad its peopled medallions suggest the work of a j'ourneyman craftsman who combined a number of motifs from a copybook.

Originally advertised as having been found at Tash Kurgan in western Turkestan,26 these and other pieces from a collection originally formed by Andre Malraux were in actuality acquired from clandestine excavations in the Peshawar area.27 The most famous examples of Gandhara stucco were excavated more than forty years ago at Hadda in Afghanistan by the Delegation archeologique francaise en Afghanistan,28 but there is no reason to conclude that every fragment of lime plaster must be attributed automatically to this site. The sculpture in the same material found around Peshawar and as far south as Taxila represents an identical technique and style, and much of it is aesthetically comparable to the best of the Hadda finds.29 It is a curious fact that never in the thousands of fragments of Gandhara stone sculpture do we find what could be called the revelation of a humanistic attitude in the sense of the artist's evident aesthetic reaction to human beauty and its presenta- tion as something physically lovely which at the same time reveals inner depths of spiritual expression. This is not the case, however, in the stucco sculptures found at Taxila and northward in the Oxus region. The origins of stucco sculpture go back to the Hellenistic art of Alexandria where the medium was first employed as a cheap substitute for marble. Certain heads of the Roman period from Sabratha in North Africa are almost exact facsimiles of Gandhara types and techniques.30 Lime plaster was introduced to Gandhara as early as the first century A.D. at Taxila and was used for architectural decoration concurrently with stone carving throughout the life span of the Gandhara school.3, Although stone sculpture admittedly became rare in the third century and later, there is no reason to suppose that stucco abruptly replaced carving in slate. The technique of decoration in stucco or substitutes for lime plaster, such as unbaked clay or terracotta, spread eastward through Central Asia and was ultimately introduced to China in the fifth century or even earlier.32 Many of the heads of minor divinities, barbarians, ascetics, soldiers of Mara's army, and yakshas, reveal not only a consummate beauty in the modeling of the face as an organic unity, but also as a revealing mask of inner emotions - grief, pity, anger, and wonder - so varied and so expressive that they appear almost like forecasts of LeBrun's repertory of the passions revealed by the human countenance.33 One must either conclude that these works were made by a different or perhaps more Western- ized artisan or that the malleable nature of the medium made possible a kind of beauty and freedom unattainable in the usual carving in slate. The presentation of the human mask as a dial registering inner emotional states was an innovation of the sculptors of the fourth century B.C. and the Hellenistic period. The dynamic turbu- lence of the school of Pergamum climaxed by the famous Laocoon enjoyed a re- vival during the Antonine period, as seen primarily in the tragic masks of dying barbarians in the battle sarcophagi of the second century A.D.34 Many of the stucco heads both from Hadda and northwestern Pakistan seem to indicate a transference of this revived Hellenistic pathos to the Gandhara school, and it is evident that the 125</page><page sequence="13">i5. Bodhisattva Maitreya. Stucco. Northwest Pakistan, 3rd century A.D. or later. H. 8 Y inches. Helen and Alice Colburn Fund. 31.367 evocative expressiveness of faces in scenes of the Nirvana or the onslaught of Mara must have been congenial to a society that conceived its religious ideals in humanistic terms. The head of a devati in the Museum collection (Fig. I3) is a perfect example of these Gandhara bozzetti. This head is a wonderful illustration of the freshness of execution and completely freehand modeling both in the pictorial working of the ringlets and in the sensitive rendering of the softness of the parted lips and chin. It is possible that some parts of the face, like the eyes and brows, more sharply defined and Indian in shape, were made with a mould. Like so many of the heads of minor divinities and attendants not affected by the conventions governing the Buddha head, this devata expresses a kind of radiant ecstasy that has reminded some critics of the spiritual realism of Gothic art (Fig. I4).3s Stucco pieces like this, separated from their original context and with no certain provenience, are extremely difficult to date. This beautiful head, like the better examples from Hadda and Taxila, might I26</page><page sequence="14">very well be dated as early as the second or third century A.D., and, as has been sug- gested, is possibly a contemporary reflection of the Antonine baroque. A second stucco fragment in this collection (Fig. I5), and originally part of the so-called Tash Kurgan finds, is a partial lunette or niche representing the Bodhi- sattva Maitreya and two attendants.36 Like other compositions of similar shape, the group when complete was probably enclosed in a heavy semicircular enframement or chaitya arch such as appears in an example in the Fogg Museum Collection (Fig. i6).37 The scene in Fig. 15 represents the Buddhist Messiah in the Tushita Heaven, his abode until his descent to become the Buddha of the next world cycle. Maitreya is shown seated in European fashion, presumably on a low throne with his legs crossed at the ankles, a posture that became established for him in Gandhara stone sculpture38 and continued as a standard feature of the Maitreya iconography in Chinese sculpture of the Six Dynasties period.39 Since Maitreya will be born as a Brahmin, he wears the topknot orjata-inukuta and holds the water bottle or kundika as attributes of his caste. His costume, comprising heavy ear pendents, torque, 16. Birth of Buddha. Northwest Pakistan, 3rd century A.D. or later. The Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University. I27</page><page sequence="15">bracelets, and a variation of the Buddhist robe, is appropriately a combination of the attributes of Buddha and Bodhisattva. The articulation of the figures of Maitreya and his companions and the soft modeling of the bodies under the diaphanous robes are reminiscent of Graeco-Roman technique, and at the same time the heavy fullness of faces and the sharp, stylized treatment of the brows and eyes seems to anticipate the Indian ideal of Buddhist sculpture in the Gupta period. If we bracket the so-called Gandhara school between the earliest and most classical carvings of about A.D. 100 and the final mannerist phase of the style in the seventh century sculpture and painting of Bamiyan and Fondukistan,40 its florescence as a homogeneous style embraces half a millennium of Indian and Central Asian history, an extraordinary longevity exceeding the life span of any other school or period of Oriental art. For Hellenophiles the art of Gandhara is an extraordinary illustration of the per- sistence and vitality of classical forms in an alien land and the universal adaptability of these ideals to native idioms. As has often been pointed out, although the iconog- raphy of Gandhira art is perforce Indian, the language of its expression is a dialect of Roman provincial art. Granted that this humanistic style was perhaps inappropriate to express the essentially mystical nature of Buddhism, the fact remains that such contributions as the anthropomorphic representation of Buddha and the sculptural narrative of his life affected the entire later course of religious art in Asia.
