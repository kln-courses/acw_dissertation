<plain_text><page sequence="1">MULTIPLES &amp; OBJECTS &amp; BOOKS Nayland Blake, Headlight (1993), a lamp signed and numbered by the artist on the inside lip of the base in an edition of 100 with 12 artist's proofs. Each lamp is 19x10x4-1/2 in. and was fabricated at New City Editions in Venice, California. The base of the light is an upturned and weighted aluminum cup in spun gold. The shade, suspended on a wire frame, is corrugated translucent paper with two flaps like locks of hair or rabbit ears and two crosses like eyes, slit and stamped on the verso in red. Such multiple references to decapitated heads, puppets, and masks are typically Blake, but Headlight's elegant design is less so. "When they approached me about doing a functional piece," he remem bers, "I thought of the classic Modernist design forms. Bauhaus designs, Noguchi, are really what I enjoy most. A lot of contem porary design is just problem solving. One of the quirks of history is that Minimalism tried to bring functional design into artmak ing, but history is more complicated than that. It's not just primary form but a host of other references. This piece refers not only to classic design but to anthropomorphism, religious iconograpy, the inexhaustible flexi bility of appearance." The light cast is also lovely. Price: prepublication $425. Pub lished by Petra Holtzman Multiples, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Squeak Carnwath, Reasons &amp; Secrets (1993), an accordion-bound book in two volumes with chemise signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 30 with ten artist's proofs. Each llx8-3/4-in. book unfolds to 10-3/4x68 in. and was printed on Rives BFK paper at Magnolia Editions in Oakland. The binding is by Pris cilla Spider of BookLab in Austin. The eight panels of the first volume, Reasons to Wake Up in the Morning present four of the artist's poems from her sketchbooks, including the title poem, which lists her reasons to wake up— breakfast, love, thought, sex, among them; the eight panels of the second cover one poem, There Are Secrets. The two volumes can function as a book, a sculpture, or a pair of prints. Col lagraph plates were inked à la poupée and more color and the text added with lithography. A computer font was made from her handwriting to guide her lettering the plates by hand. Not too surprisingly, Carnwath's childlike imagery and words work well in a book. Price: $2,600. Copublished by Magnolia Editions, Oakland, and Pacific Editions, San Francisco. Roberta Delaney, I Wake Alone (1993), a portfolio of five black and white lithographs with six sheets of text signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 15. Each lithograph is 23-3/4x20 in. and was printed on Rives BFK paper by the artist at Wheaton College in Nor ton, Massachusetts. The type was set on Rives BKF and vellum at Firefly Press in Somerville, Massachusetts. Delaney is a printmaker drawn to the book form, finding the concept of sequences much like stages in making a print. She is comfortable, too, combining words and images. "The text, like a title, clarifies by artic ulating what I am experiencing emotionally as a visual artist," she says. The portfolio text is a translation by Shirley Hazzard of "I Wake Alone" by the Italian poet Camillo Sbarbaro. Delaney had already started work on two of the prints when she read the poem in The New Yorker. "The tone of the prints corresponded to the poem in their starkness and scale," and she did three more in the same dark vein. The poem was printed once in black on the opaque Rives and then repeated in five translucent overlays, mostly in gray, with fragments in black creating patterns of type. These patterns play against Delaney's bold markings, creating a dialogue between two lonely voices. Separat ing the two to see, the viewer joins in. Price: $1,200.

Each book is a different weight and size and was painted with tempera and bound, one by one, with cotton fabric, string or rope, and stamped with various num bers by the artist at his studio in New York. The series recently carpeted a gallery floor at John Gibson Gallery like "a social body, parts, real parts, of a huge abstraction," says the artist, "a space where reflection can take place." All books were completely black, a color Pellegrin values for its presence; the tempera and bindings pre vent opening pages. The installation referred to not treading on culture, as Pellegrin explains: "Historically the book holds and carries on knowledge. . . .Our age has lost any ambition for knowledge, developing the flatness of our cultural landscape.... We must be aware that knowledge is the only way for the emancipation of human kind." The venerable QF at the Gro lier Club would never take Pellegrin's bandaged book to bed, but he and the artist share essential values. Price: $500 each; books can be pur chased in any number and placed anywhere. Published by the artist, New York. Available at John Gibson Gallery, New York Robert Wilson &amp; Osip Mandelstam, Draft Notes for "A Conversation on Dante" (1993), a boxed book with 15 double-page lithographs and eight double-page texts signed and numbered by the artist in an edi tion of 90 with 20 artist's proofs. Each litho graph is 20-3/8x29-1/2 in. and was printed on Arches paper at Atelier Franck Bordas in Paris. The letterpress was set on vellum by Geuze, the covers made of paper by Phoenix, and the wood box by Profilex in Amsterdam. Concept and design are by Rik Gadella. The texts are 36 fragments from the 1933 essay on Dante by the Russian poet/philosopher Osip Mandelstam, translated by Paul Schmidt, who also contributes an afterword: " 'What exactly is an image?' Mandelstam begins. 'An instrument for metamorphosis,' he answers. The set of images in this book pro vide a metamorphosis indeed: the transfor mation of Mandelstam's vision into Robert Wilson's. Mandelstam heard his vision, while Wilson sees his, yet the remarkable thing here is the congruence of these two per ceptions of Dante." Dividing the fragments like four acts, Wilson's sequence begins as a solid horizontal band that almost crosses the folio, changes to bands of gestural markings, breaks into separate rectangles, and ends streaked with various light effects. "So in the complex stratifications of this book, poet's mouth and artist's hand, Dante's tongue and Mandelstam's ear, Wilson's hand and our eyes, all as one become tower, and river, and thunderstorm, illuminated in flashes of lightning." Schmidt's rhetoric sound a bit much? Not really. Wilson delivers, as always, with dramatic concentration, using the form of a book like a storyboard. Price: $5,000. Published by Picaron Editions, Paris, Amsterdam, New York. Available in New York through Marcel Sitcoske.</page></plain_text>
