<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE IDENTITY OF ROMAN GERASA: AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL APPROACH* David Kennedy A. INTRODUCTION Certainly Delhi is unimaginably antique ... Tombs of emperors stand beside traffic junctions, forgotten fortresses command suburbs, the titles of lost dynasties are woven into the vernacular, if only as street names. One of the oldest and deadest places I know ... is the crumbled fortress-capital of Tughluqabad in the city's southern outskirts. For a single decade it was a place of terrific consequence, for nearly seven centuries since it has been a grey wasteland of piled stones and ruined alleyways ... inhabited only by the disagreeable monkeys which are the familiars of Delhi ... (adapted from Jan Morris, Among the Cities, London ['Mrs Gupta never rang. Delhi, 1975']). Fergus Millar's thesis for the Roman Near East argues—largely on the basis of written, especially epigraphic, evidence—that it became rapidly and thoroughly imbued with Graeco Roman culture. He has also considered at least some of the material culture of the region and interpreted that, too, as evidence for the widespread adoption of essentially Classical forms in art, architecture, town planning, and much else.1 Inevitably, even on the central area of interpretation, the language, there has been dissension,2 and archaeologists have yet more reservations about his treatment of the physical remains.3 Millar focused on language and epigraphy not least because the corpus of evidence is reasonably large and it is accessible; conversely, whatever one feels about his interpretation of the archaeological evidence, it required a fortitude few archaeologists would muster to have gone beyond the written evidence at all. Publication for the material culture is vast and enticing in its very range and quantity. On the other hand, it is often what Collingwood, writing of an analogous situation for Roman Britain in 1930, described as bulky, inaccessible because of its technical form, and 'repulsively unintelligible'. The researcher working on the Roman Near East will soon discover—as Collingwood did for Britain—that applying the material evidence is difficult because for so many aspects 'elementary and simple ideas were just what no one seemed previously to have worked out' .4 This is not an indictment of archaeologists of the Roman Near East. The region is large, evidence is abundant, and high standards of analysis and publication impose obstacles and delay. Moreover, there have been attempts to go beyond cataloguing and site publication to offer interpretative essays.5 Much remains to be done, and * I am grateful to Philip Freeman and David Graf who commented on earlier versions of this text and offered valuable suggestions.

Kennedy an analysis of the material culture comparable to the thoroughness of Millar's for the written evidence is not in sight. The present essay is intended to explore, through focusing largely on a single city, the potential of archaeological evidence for revealing the identity of one of these great symbols of Classical civilization everywhere. In selecting the archaeological evidence and an archaeological approach, the aim is to explore a category of evidence which is relatively underused. Moreover, it may offer insights on a level quite different from what we may expect from written sources. The latter retain an important place and provide evidence of a kind which might not otherwise be detectable easily, if at all. A notable example from epigraphy for Gerasa is that for the surprising frequency with which officials of the provincial government were recorded there. Isaac saw the six inscriptions naming procurators of the province of Arabia as evidence for Gerasa— rather than Bostra—as the financial centre of Arabia.6 Likewise, 70 years of fieldwork have failed to reveal any structure which implied a permanent garrison, yet inscriptions record an auxiliary regiment there in the 1st century ad.7 Each category of evidence has its place; ideally one will carry out a holistic study but here the concern is almost solely with the archaeological evidence. The subject Gerasa was one of the cities of the Decapolis, several of which lay in what is now northern Jordan, in the angle between the Jordan and Yarmuk rivers. Here one encounters also Philadelphia (modern Amman), Capitolias, Adraha, Gadara, and Pella, and—opposite Pella but west of the river Jordan—Scythopolis. Although only just over 100 km Straight Line Distance (SLD) from Caesarea on the Mediterranean, Gerasa is very much an inland city. It lay in a region of some of the greatest cities of the Roman world but in imperial terms it was one of the most distant points from Rome itself. Gerasa, though relatively small, is a magnificent example of a city of the Roman Near East (fig. 1). It spreads over some 85 ha with a planned layout encircled by walls; two kilometres . of colonnaded streets, temples dedicated to Artemis, Zeus, and other Classical deities, two theatres, and a hippodrome attest to the cultural aspirations of the population. The modern traveller, approaching along roads still marked in places by Roman milestones, first glimpses the town through the opening of a Roman monumental arch; scores of Corinthian columns symbolize the Graeco-Roman language of the architecture, and the hundreds of inscriptions are overwhelmingly in Greek. Plainly it has much in common with numerous other cities of the Roman Near East where many of these same features are repeatedly encountered. The overall impression is of a sameness to the urban centres and we may reasonably suppose the ancient traveller would have found comfort in familiar elements. In that respect the cities support the thesis of Fergus Millar that the Roman Near East, rapidly and very thoroughly, lost its principal indigenous characteristics and became widely and deeply imbued with a regional variant of the Graeco-Roman culture found around the entire Mediterranean in the Early Roman period. And yet, Gerasa was no mere clone and the cities of the Roman Near East were neither dull nor endlessly familiar. It is not just that the surrounding Syrian Desert made Palmyra very different from Apamea or that the novelty of location set Petra apart from its neighbours. In numerous and cumulatively significant ways, each of the cities of the region had its own 6 Β. Isaac, The Limits of Empire. The Roman Army in the East (rev. ed. 1993) 345-6. See now P.-L.

Gerasa offers particular opportunities both through the quality and extent of its survival and because the great excavations there in the 1920s and 30s have continued ever since and culminated in the 1980s in the major programme of international collaboration there, some of which continues still (1998). The outcome, despite much yet unpublished, is a large corpus of evidence for both the town and its territory.8 Moreover, and essential for comparative purposes, there has been significant if lesser research at three of its principal neighbours: Gadara, Pella, and Philadelphia.9 The purpose of this paper is to move towards an archaeological identity for Gerasa and to define what made it different.10 Approaching the evidence The inspiration for this essay lies in the work of the great historian Fernand Braudel. The annaliste approach in archaeology associated with his name may seem rather passé in the post-modern maelstrom of competing ideologies in archaeology. However, the recent stimulating application of annalisme to an important project in Italy underscores the enduring value of the approach." Two themes are at the forefront of much of Braudel's writing: the dominating influence of structures in determining the character and course of history and yet the astonishing diversity within the resulting cultures when examined in detail. In 1949 in his magisterial study of the Mediterranean world in the age of Philip II of Spain—described by one reviewer as 'an archaeology of the Mediterranean'—Braudel argued that events and the actions of individuals in history were often no more, as he put it, than eddies on the surface of a slow-moving, unstoppable ocean. In contrast to this feeble short-term of mere events, medium term structures were far more powerful—those such as the great man-made trends in history and what he called mentalités, the world view evolved by societies. Most powerful of all, however, were the millennial structures—geography and environment—forming, con 8 The literature is increasingly voluminous. Still the best by far is the work edited by Kraeling (op. cit. η. 7). The brief but delightful book by R. Khouri, Jerash.

Finally there is the theme which Braudel developed a generation later in his final major study when he had turned from the broad world of the Mediterranean to what, for him, was the relatively constricted canvas of France alone. The results are best presented in his own opening comment to the first volume of his L'identité de la France: Pour commencer, le plus simple est de présenter les choses telles qu'on les voit, telles qu'elles se dessinent au premier abord, j'allais dire au premier coup d'œuil. A cette observation liminaire, nous reconnaissons sans tarder que l'unité de la France s'efface. On croyait la saisir d'entrée de jeu, elle nous fuit; cent, mille Frances sont en place, jadis, hier, aujourd'hui. Acceptons cette vérité, cette profusion, cette insistance à laquelle il n'est ni désagréable, ni même trop dangereux de céder. 14 Three major themes are signalled out for a Braudelian approach to seeking an identity for Gerasa. First, we must define Gerasa in terms of the millennial structures, geography and environment, of the sub-region; define it too in terms of the city and its territory and its immediate neighbours. Second, the impact on Gerasa of its own past—the evidence for features of earlier, sometimes distant actions which, enduringly, 'altered the earth'.15 Finally, while acknowledging the unifying effect on modern France of roads, canals, and newspapers and the significant erosion of regionalism and the multiplicity of local dialects, Braudel remained almost startled by how much diversity there yet remained beneath a mounting sameness over wide areas. Here, too, Millar's thesis of seeming widespread uniformity in language and culture may be set against the possibility of continuing and significant local identities imposed by the place and by the weight of the past. Not just numerous contemporary identities but communities which evolved new identities over long periods of time. B. REGIONAL CONTEXT The geography and environment of Gerasa Beyond the walls and cemeteries of Gerasa lay a varied landscape, environment, and climate. By the time Roman rule was extended to this region, the landscape had already been extensively domesticated by millennia of human activity. All around were the traces of that intervention and Roman Gerasa and the Roman Empire were to make their impact too. This was a world, however, in which the human constructs of society and culture—even beneath the bold confident exteriors of Classical civilization—were still profoundly influenced by, and vulnerable to, natural forces. We must first define the structures of the world of Gerasa and consider their impact. 12 F.

Kennedy The three principal features of the region are the wide deep trough of the Jordan river extending southwards as Lake Tiberias, the Dead Sea, then the Wadi Arabah; second, the highlands which rise steeply east of this trough to a plateau; finally, the arid zone which slopes away gently eastwards from the plateau as first steppe then desert (fig. 2).16 Two major lateral features define the region further. In the north, the Yarmuk is the major tributary of the Jordan (fig. 3). Although its branches drain a broad and relatively shallow basin east of Lake Tiberias the river is long, flows through a deep and narrow cut, and has always been a formidable obstacle. The Wadi Mujib in the south is a much smaller tributary but its broad and deep canyon still represents a major natural boundary. The intervening plateau between these two is marked by numerous lateral tributaries but principally by the Wadi Zerqa which is a perennial water course as far as the modern town of Zerqa and divides the plateau into two parts: the northern Belqa and the highlands of Ajlun. Gerasa lies in the latter. The landscape and climate of the highlands of Ajlun are very varied (fig. 2; cf. fig. 8). In the far north, for example, Gadara (the modern village of Umm Qeis) is perched on a 300 m high plateau overlooking the Yarmuk and Lake Tiberias.17 Although its principal farm lands lay on the plateau to the south and east, its outlook was, literally and dramatically, west and north-west over the Jordan valley, the extensive lake, and towards Palestine. Further south, Pella (Tabaqat Fahl) was located just 4 km east of the Jordan but 50 m below sea level in the irrigable but humid conditions of the valley. Philadelphia (Amman), lying south of the Wadi Zerqa in the Northern Belqa, at 800 m is the highest of these cities, but on the fringe of the desert and exposed to its desiccating climate. Only 80 km separate Gadara and Philadelphia, the most widely separated of this group, yet each place in its own way is quite distinctive. Gerasa between them is different again. It lies at c.500 m in an area still forested to some extent with oak and pine and enjoys a Mediterranean climate of warm dry summers and mild wet winters. From the point of view of human exploitation, the defining features are soils and water. Gerasa lies in the heart of a zone of Red Mediterranean Soils which give way about 10 km to the east to the Yellow Mediterranean Soils of the steppe (fig. 4:1). The soil type is significant—the red support cereals but are especially well-suited to the cultivation of vegetables and fruits; the yellow are more suitable for cereals and stock-grazing.18 While fertile soils are fundamental to cultivation, equally vital is water (fig. 3). The defining feature of the Jerash region is the Wadi Zerqa, the Biblical Jabbok. It is fed by several important perennial tributaries and numerous seasonal streams. Gerasa was founded on one of the former, the Wadi Jerash, which the Greek colonists called the Chrysorhoas, the golden river. In addition, there are still frequent and abundant springs at Gerasa and on the hill slopes all around. In the immediate vicinity of Gerasa the land is high and hilly, but the level of precipitation is what differentiates it from Amman, 300 m higher and only a little further east (fig. 4: 2). Modern Jerash receives between 300 and 400 mm annually, and this increases steeply within a short distance as the land rises westwards into the Ajlun Highlands. Ajlun itself, only 15 km to the north-west but 500 m higher than Jerash, receives over 600 mm annually. Jerash lies 16 Especially useful for a concise and authoritative description of the physical geography of the region is the Palestine and Transjordan volume in the (British) Admiralty Naval Intelligence Handbook series. Cf. F. Bender, The Geology of Jordan (transi, of German 1969 edition, 1981). For climate see the recent Jordanian publication (Atlas 1984). 17 An impression of the local physical geography of Gerasa, Gadara, Pella, and Philadelphia may be seen to some extent in the delightful oblique aerial views of J. Taylor, High Above Jordan (1989) 12-17, 20-1, 24-5. 18 Bender op. cit. 187-9; cp. J. W. Hanbury-Tenison, AAJ 31, 1987, 130.</page><page sequence="7">The Identity of Roman Gerasa 45 Figure 2.

It is very different from that at Amman 36 km to the south. In agricultural terms Jerash lies firmly within the attractive 350-500 mm dry farming zone of northern Jordan; Amman lies within the next band and close to the edge of the water-deficit region (fig. 4: 4). Jerash is 30 km from the very arid zone and separated from it by hills which offered many opportunities for settlement and cultivation. Here, graphically, one can see the force of the recent observation that Jerash enjoys a Mediterranean environment while Amman lies on the edge of the desert and</page><page sequence="9">The Identity of Roman Gerasa 47 A = Red Mediterranean Soils Β = Red Med Soils, deeply developed C = Yellow Mediterranean Soils D = Yellow Soils Regosols Ε = Gray Desert Soils F = Saline Soils G = Sal Soils Gypist Sediments H = Rendzins v.

These factors have long been true, there having been no significant climatic changes during the Holocene. Time now to turn to determining what parts of this landscape belonged to Gerasa and defining that territory relative to its neighbours. 19 Northedge op. cit. (no. 9) 20. He notes that al-Muqaddasi observed in the 10th cent, that Amman lay 'on the border of the steppe'.</page><page sequence="10">48 D. Kennedy The territory of Gerasa The town presided over a territory whose extent and character would have influenced the identity of the urban and rural population. In his survey of the Decapolis towns, Bietenhard published a map setting out the boundaries of Gerasa and its neighbours (fig. 5).20 Some lines are no more than suggestions, not least that which placed the eastern boundary of these Decapolis cities well east of the town—roughly along a north south line through modern Mafraq and c.20 km east of Amman. On the authority of the statement of Eusebius in the early 4th century that the boundary between Gerasa and Philadelphia lay on the river Jabbok,21 Bietenhard placed the southern line along the Wadi Zerqa where it runs roughly east/west in a deep valley about 8 km south of Gerasa. On the west the line is located where the Decapolis had a shared boundary with the Peraea, the eastern part of Palestine which is known to have spanned the Jordan valley and reached up onto the Jordanian plateau. Finally, Bietenhard places the boundary with Pella on an oblique line running south-west to north-east. This is a large territory and it includes an extensive area of steppe on the east with all that implies for the character of the polis as a whole. Recent fieldwork together with some older finds in this area may now permit us to define the boundaries with more confidence. What emerges is not only a territory notably more limited, but the placing of the boundaries is of interest when viewed in terms of the geography and environment. First is the remarkable fieldwork by Jacques Seigne of the Institut Français d'Archéologie du Proche-Orient in Amman. In the course of fieldwork around Jerash, Seigne was led to a few places where one could read the Greek letters ΠΟΓΕ incised on rock outcrops.22 He sought others in similar locations and finally traced 10 such inscriptions. In places they were numerous enough to suggest a linear pattern and he also identified stretches of man-made embankment along parts of the same alignment. He expands the letters as Po(lis) Ge(rasa) and is surely correct in seeing them as the boundary markers of Gerasa for at least one point in its history. The pattern (fig. 6) shows they ran along a watershed and, where that was unclear or possibly as a more visible marker, a bank was provided.23 Many more markers may yet be found giving the potential for defining the entire territory of Gerasa.

Seigne in: Syria (forthcoming). 23 No traces of the banks noted by Seigne are detect able on any of the air photographs of the region. It would probably require photographs taken when low sun cast shadows behind the earthworks.</page><page sequence="11">The Identity of Roman Gerasa 49 There are three notable features of the pattern. First, in the direction of Philadelphia the markers lie some distance south of the Jabbok/ W. Zerqa. Second, in the north they are much closer to Gerasa than Bietenhard had proposed for the boundary. Finally, on the east they do not even reach the steppe much less far out into it. None has yet been traced on the west. The date of the boundary markers is unknown—Seigne suggests the early 2nd century ad—and we cannot tell to what extent they represent the long-term boundary over the course of several centuries. The second source of evidence is founded on the old suggestion that the distances recorded on milestones may be a guide to territorial boundaries. Some roads have milestones with numerals ascending in sequence for mile after mile but then Figure 6. Inscribed boundary markers and changing to a sequence which descends ancient embankments around Jerash towards the next destination. The point of (after Seigne forthcoming). change has been explained as marking the territorial boundary between the two cities.24 Three of the four major Roman roads radiating from Gerasa have milestones with such a change in numbering. (a) The road to Philadelphia has been clarified considerably only recently.25 The discovery of a milestone recording 12 M.P from Gerasa followed by one a mile later with 15 from Philadelphia suggests the boundary between the two cities lay here. That place is almost exactly where Seigne has now also traced three of the boundary markers for Gerasa and stretches of embankment. In short, we may be confident than on this south side the territory of Gerasa extended for 12 M.P.—some 15/16 km—to and beyond the Wadi Zerqa. (b) For the road north to Adraha, Mittmann has shown that the road was in fact regarded as an indirect one between Bostra and Gerasa by way of Adraha along which distances south of the latter were counted from Bostra before changing to distances from Gerasa. At one milestation south of Adraha, the stone recorded the distance back to Bostra (44 M.P) and an additional numeral (20 M.P.) which reflected the distance back to Adraha as well (below). In general, however, Adraha seems to have been treated simply as a point along the route. Mittmann concluded that the point at which the change to numbering from Gerasa occurred was the northern boundary at that point of its territory. The place is uncertain—after the stone recording 44 M.P. from Bostra and 20 from Adraha a milestone was reported many years ago by Germer-Durand which recorded 10 M.P. from Gerasa but another from the same place bore a numeral counting still from Bostra. Next came one with 46 and 9 from Gerasa. The meaning is not clear—either the 10th milestation marked the boundary of the territory of Gerasa but they continued to give the distance from Bostra too, or, as Mittmann implies, the Figure 6. Inscribed boundary markers and ancient embankments around Jerash (after Seigne forthcoming). 24 A. Alt, ZDPV 68, 1951, 235-45. 25 A.-M. Rasson-Seigne-J. Seigne, AAJ 39, 1995, 193-210; cp. S.

Kennedy boundary with Gerasa had not yet been reached but they were now adding the mileage to the town anyway. Nature may be more helpful here. The tenth milestation lies beyond the lateral watershed north of Jerash. It would make more sense and harmonize more with the indicators of boundary traced by Seigne in this area to place the road boundary further south along this prominent watershed from Ain Janna to Qafqafa (fig. 7). (c) To the north-west there are several milestones from the Pella road but their original locations are unclear. What seems certain is that here too the numbering changed and at a point not quite halfway between the two. The most recent commentator located that point close to modern Ajlun.26 The mileages are probably 10 from Pella and 12 from Gerasa.27 The vicinity of Ajlun is a natural boundary between the lateral watershed north of Jerash (from Ain Janna through Qafqafa) and the longitudinal which marked the scarp leading down to the Jordan (fig. 7). The latter was also the boundary between the provinces of Arabia and Palaestina.28 (d) The direct road to Bostra is the least well-known of those from Gerasa. It is believed to run via Rihab past the ancient site of El-Fedein on the west side of modern Mafraq then onwards to join the Via Nova Traiana some 20 km north-east of Mafraq. Several milestones have been recorded on the road on this last stretch between Mafraq and the Via Nova; all are numbered from the point of junction with the Via Nova. On the long stretch between Gerasa and Mafraq where a change in direction for numbering is most likely there is only the report by Glueck of 'several broken Roman milestones' at Khatleh, c.5 km ENE of Jerash on the modern road.30 As we have seen however (above), Seigne found markers on this side of ο 1 Gerasa, and these imply that the boundary lay about 6 km east of Jerash. The mile indications, combined with the boundary markers and a reading of the natural boundaries in the landscape, combine to permit a more precise extent and shape for the territory of Gerasa. What emerges is a city with a territory far more circumscribed than one might expect—confined in fact between the Jebel Ajlun which forms a longitudinal watershed on the west, the Ain Janna-Qafqafa watershed on the north and the ridge just east of Jerash. Only in the south is the territory unexpectedly more extensive than supposed. Not only did Eusebius place the boundary between Gerasa and Philadelphia on the Wadi Zerqa, but that is what one might have expected.32 Plainly, however, the important natural features 26 Smith op. cit.

Dalman, ZDPV 31, 1908, 270-1, the milestations from Pella passed by Ba'un and Khirbet Mehna (near where he recorded that for X M. P. from Pella). Milestone [XI]I from Gerasa was recorded in the mosque at Ajlun. Reuse of tall milestones as columns in mosques is well-known in the vicinity where several of those on this Gerasa-Pella road were still visible in the disused mosque at Suf in 1974, shortly before which their inscriptions had been heavily defaced (Thomsen op. cit. 65-6). The milestone in the mosque at Ajlun could have been carried some distance, and while Ain Janna is on the natural route from Suf to Ba'un to the north-west, Ajlun lies off to the side. 29 Cf. now D. L. Kennedy, Levant 29, 1997, 74-6. 30 The alignment of the road itself east of Jerash is unknown. The modern road leaves from the south, then loops north, then south again to traverse the hills. The ancient road may have left from a supposed gate on the north-east but we might consider the possibility that it ran from the north gate up onto the watershed before turning east through Qafqafa towards Mafraq. The milestone fragments reported by N. Glueck, Explorations in Eastern Palestine, III. AASOR 18/19, 1939, 71 (cp. Mittmann op. cit. 163), imply it was following the modern road at least around Khatleh where he saw them. 31 Longer by the winding road which leads eastwards from Jerash. If milestones are ever traced in this area, one might expect the change from numbering from Gerasa to numbering down towards Bostra to come at or about 6M.P. 32 It may be argued that Eusebius was reporting what, by his time, was the boundary. It is not clear why such</page><page sequence="13">The Identity of Roman Gerasa 51 Figure 7. The boundaries of Gerasa: a suggested reconstruction. were less the water courses than the watersheds—in the south here, too, the location of the boundary lies on the watershed above the Zerqa before going down into the region of tributaries around Amman. The people of Gerasa—like those of at least some of their neighbours—had territorial horizons which extended to the hilly watersheds rather than the an adjustment would have taken place, however, and easier to explain Eusebius as doing no more than locating the boundary very loosely by reference to a familiar Biblical landmark, the Jabbok, rather than to the actual watershed boundary.</page><page sequence="14">52 D. Kennedy troughs of the major water courses. In a region in which water for man, animal, and crops was vital and the source of potential strife, it made sense to divide the resource in this way.33 The territory of Gerasa in context Ideally one would explore the relationship between Gerasa and its neighbours on every side and trace the ways in which each developed within its own distinctive context. There has now been some intensive survey in the wider region but so far none has taken place in the territory of Gerasa itself.34 Various efforts at recording have provided a great deal of information about individual sites and this is especially true of the region east of Gerasa. Focusing on this last, the area of steppe land, has the additional advantage of allowing us to consider Millar's claim that the common defining feature of all the regions of Roman Arabia was their proximity to, If and relationship with, the steppe and the desert beyond. As we have seen, Gerasan territory apparently ended just a few kilometres east of the city on a watershed which also, broadly, marks a transition from Red to Yellow Soils and to sharply declining rainfall. Declining but, as the modern maps illustrate (fig. 4), leaving a large triangle broadening as it runs north and pushing out into the steppe on either side of the present Syria-Jordan frontier. Today the region is marked by numerous villages and extensive agriculture but much of it is the product of deep-drilling for water which was beyond the technology of the ancient world. For a more useful insight on an earlier period with simple technology, there is now the important research by Martha Mundy on Late Ottoman land tenure registers.36 Mundy has shown there was until quite recently a marked difference on either side of a line beginning just east of Jerash between village-based cultivation on the west with olives and other fruits prominent alongside wheat, and the territory exploited on the east by a bedouin tribe, the Beni Hassan. In this tribal area there was extensive stock-raising with cereals virtually the only crop. More telling, land valuations there could differ by a factor of 10, and land ownership consisted of several small plots in widely separated areas, a sign of people adopting a risk-management strategy in a region of more marginal farming. But settled farming was possible and the security and stability of the 20th century permitted cultivation to be extended considerably, even before drilling. On Mundy's maps the dividing line between the village-based socio-economic regime on the west, and the tribal, shared semi-pastoralism to the east, corresponds closely to the broad position of the 300-mm rainfall isohyet east of Jerash and of the eastern boundary of the territory of Jerash itself as just defined.37 We should no longer view Gerasa as a city already incorporating extensive steppe lands in its boundaries and directly responsible for a semi-pastoral population. Quite the reverse—its eastern boundary ended very much where the truly Mediterranean climate and vegetation of the Jebel Ajlun changed to that of the steppe, and the steep hills and narrow valleys west of Jerash became the lower hills, wider valleys, and steppe lands to the east. Springs remain abundant to the east, but the crucial factor is the decline in precipitation—still adequate for 33 The precise boundary between the Peraea of Palaestina and Arabia may be located more precisely by adopting the same criteria. East of the Jordan the natural boundary of the Peraea would have been on the scarp and included all the headwaters of the wadis running down into the Jordan. The Yarmuk and Zerqa would be more problematic, of course. The boundary of the Peraea in the north certainly struck further inland and included the first large group of southern tributaries of the Yarmuk and all the high ground from Jerash north through Irbid. Further south, the Wadi Zerqa may likewise have drawn the boundary further east to include some of its lower tributaries. 34 There has been some non-intensive survey in recent years by J. Sapin within the 'Jerash Basin' but it remains unpublished. 35 Millar op. cit. (η. 1)387. 36 M.

Unlike the Ajlun Highlands, one does not encounter in the steppe extensive groves of olives and vines which appear only in the cottage gardens around villages. It was apparently here, on the natural boundary of the territory of Gerasa with the steppe just a few kilometres to the east, that the city was most closely exposed to neighbouring influences. The only city in that direction is Bostra, and the boundary markers located by Seigne suggest its territory extended to within a few kilometres of the walls of Gerasa. Support for the territorial division here comes from mosaic inscriptions of the 6/7th century which quite clearly show that the small town of Rihab in this region between Gerasa and Mafraq belonged to the diocese of Bostra rather than either the closer Gerasa or even Philadelphia.38 Before ad 106 this region—including Bostra—had belonged to the developing Nabataean kingdom. In the 2nd and 1st centuries bc Hellenistic Gerasa, looking east over this steppe landscape, encountered Nabataeans ruling from their heartlands far to the south in Moab and for whom the steppe here was a corridor to their new lands in the fertile Hauran (fig. 7). Physical traces of the Nabataeans in this early period are rare and settlements are few and small. The primary use of the land was probably for grazing with cultivation limited to a few modest areas. The main lines of what followed can be inferred from the growing evidence from a variety of sites. First was the burgeoning presence of Nabataeans at Gerasa itself and in other Decapolis cities: pottery, coins, inscriptions, temples dedicated to their gods can all be dated to the Roman period of the 1st centuries bc and ad.40 Further east, the Nabataean route through the steppe to the Hauran was probably the line adopted for the later Roman highway, the Via Nova Traiana. Certainly Nabataean material has been found at several sites along its course best known for their remains of the Roman period. In the Hauran, the new Nabataean city of Bostra was flourishing by the late 1st century ad and chosen by the Romans, after their annexation of the Nabataean kingdom in 106, as the base for their legionary garrison and capital of the new province of Arabia. In short, if the people of Hellenistic Gerasa had seen only a thinly peopled landscape to their east, that was much changed by the time Rome annexed the region. Under Roman rule the steppe lands were opened up still further with new roads—not just the great Via Nova Traiana, but others linking the area to Gerasa and other Decapolis cities and, later, new roads to its east across not just steppe but into the desert beyond. The steppe was settled yet more extensively. Sites are of all kinds, but especially striking and characteristic of a region in which the sole city, Bostra, was far to the north-east, were the villages, several of which were in reality small towns. They are best known from the Late Roman period with their stone-built houses, upper storeys, tall towers, churches, reservoirs, and cisterns. Several of those nearest the major routes included caravanserais and forts.41 38 A. Alt, ZDPV 68, 1951, 235-45; M. Piccirillo, AAJ 24, 1980,153-6. 39 R. Wenning, Die Nabatâer.

Kennedy These are Late Roman, but if the 4th-6th centuries are the most visible at such sites we can hardly doubt this was the culmination of generations of development during earlier Roman centuries. In short, there was a dramatic change in the character of the steppe lands east of Gerasa. Within its own territory sites seem to have increased in number and size. The character of steppe lands was transformed by settlement, creating a broad world of villages stretching two or three days' journey eastward. Unlike Philadelphia where settlement on the east was relatively limited, Gerasa was steadily cushioned from the world of nomads and the desert, its own identity altering in the process. C. THE WEIGHT OF HISTORY The altered earth Millar has argued that the Roman Near East suffered from 'historical amnesia'. It may well be true that in the early Roman period there was little depth to their cultural history—the Early Iron Age and Persian periods were seemingly marked by very thin settlement and ended in disruption which might well have created a rupture in knowledge.42 But echoes of a more distant past and a pre-Greek culture may have lingered in various ways. In the landscape of Gerasa and its neighbours, archaeologists have traced the artefacts of many periods. In the immediately pre-Classical period the vicinity of Gerasa was thinly settled; throughout northern Jordan—including at Jerash—sites of the Persian period are rare, and Hellenistic sites, if more numerous, are still uncommon, especially for the 3rd century bc.43 Oral tradition might well have preserved a memory of that period but it went largely unmarked in the archaeological record: there were no Iron Age towns, no public monuments, and such settlements as we know of were small and widely spaced. The population of Roman Gerasa both urban and rural may well have seen their identity as in part that of descendants of Greek pioneers in a thinly settled land and in large part a new population with limited links to a barely visible Iron Age.44 Not so the Bronze Age. As elsewhere in the region and throughout the Near East, the Bronze Age is second only to the Classical period in terms of numbers and size of pre-20th century settlements. The scattered evidence is instructive. Hanbury-Tenison, for example, deliberately selected sites for her survey which were known to be Bronze Age, the period of her particular interest. Nevertheless, more than half her sites (34 of-59) were also, she noted, occupied in the Roman/Byzantine period two millennia later.45 These later settlements were often directly over or alongside their Bronze Age predecessors. Beyond the settlements lay the extensive traces of ancient cemeteries, older still than the Bronze Age remains. This entire region of northern Jordan is notable for the large numbers of dolmens still visible on the hill slopes and dated to the Chalcolithic and later. In the Jerash area, Glueck reported concentrations north-east of Jerash around the village of Qafqafa,46 and many others are noted by him and by Hanbury-Tenison elsewhere around Jerash.47 They remain still highly visible landmarks (pi. 3: 1) even after extensive damage and destruction in the last generation; they were far more evident half a century ago when Glueck worked in this area and would have been yet more striking elements of the Roman landscape two thousand years the Via Nova. West of the Roman highway, Rihab (above) is the best-known of several villages in the region to reveal Roman-period occupation (e. g., N. Glueck, Explorations in Eastern Palestine, VI. A AS OR 25-28, [1988] 79-96). 42 W. Zwickel, Eisenzeitliche Ortslagen: Ostjordanland (1990). 43 Cp. R. H.

The people of Roman Gerasa, both urban and rural, would have been conscious of living amidst the numerous and significant traces of a distant past. We know they belong 1000-2000 years before the foundation of Hellenistic Gerasa but, like the modern bedouin with the ancient remains in the desert to the east, the people of ancient Gerasa may have thought of these features vaguely as 'The Works of the Old Men' with no concept of when and who. Nor can we know how the Roman inhabitants of the area thought of these remains beneath and around their farms and villages, and studding their fields. What is certain is that these earlier builders had 'altered the earth',48 and some of that alteration endured and remains prominent still. In the Aegean, Bronze Age tombs were frequently reused in the Classical period and this has been explained as a conscious move by later people to establish their ownership of the landscape by identifying with the people who built the ancient tombs.49 The evidence is slight for any such parallel in the Near East, but in the Hauran we know that some of the tumuli—which probably originally covered all the hundreds of dolmens there— were reused for burials in the Roman period.50 It remains true, moreover, that both pastoralists of the steppe and agriculturalists of the highlands had a vested interest in recognizing—if not venerating—these ancient traces and laying claim to them. In northern Jordan the past was highly visible and its weight, perhaps unconsciously, was part of the identity of the population of Roman Gerasa. At Gerasa itself, there was ancient settlement on or around the site from early prehistory, Bronze Age settlement in the SW around the Oval Piazza, and Iron Age in the same area. Hellenistic settlement seems to have begun in the early 2nd century bc with the foundation of a town officially named Antioch-on-the-Chrysorhoas, probably surrounding a fort.51 A century later it came under Roman rule, assigned to the newly created province of Syria in 63 BC. In ad 106 it was detached from Syria when the Nabataean kingdom was annexed and the province of Arabia formed. It remained under Roman rule for six centuries longer until the entire region fell to the Islamic armies. During the subsequent centuries it declined and by the 12th century it was long deserted and remained so until the foundation of a Circassian colony there in the 19th century. The implication of the name, 'Antioch on the Chrysorhoas which is Gerasa', is of significance.52 The Greek name—presumably the 'official' one—is often recorded but the persistence of 'Gerasa', even in formal inscriptions of the élite such as that on the arch,53 implies an attachment to and importance of the older, presumably Semitic, name (whatever its meaning).54 This pre-Hellenic past could never have been unimportant to them. The magnificent and huge bulk of the Classical Temple of Zeus dominated, but it may have developed over an older native cult place.55 However, too little is known of the less monumental structures in the city. For example, just south of the Temple of Artemis, the later church of St Theodore was found to have obliterated a cemetery associated with what the excavators identified as a heroon, a temple-tomb they named Temple C. Tomb and cemetery were lost to sight when the city expanded and this area was developed.56 48 Cp. above and n. 15. 49 Cp. R. Osborne, Greece in the Making, 1200-479 B. C. (1996) 103-4, 364. 50 A.

Kraeling, BASOR 83,</page><page sequence="18">56 D. Kennedy At the moment when Roman rule was imposed on Gerasa the town already had a significant urban history and may already have claimed a Macedonian foundation. When Constantine the Great ruled, the principal public architecture of Gerasa was already two centuries old and there would have been structures which would have been survivors of the early town of two centuries earlier still. In the 5th and 6th centuries when the major churches were being constructed with their fine mosaic floors, the great pagan temples of the town were ancient structures, some in ruins, remodelledOr overbuilt, the town itself perhaps much shrunken. The very success of the Gerasans in developing a town so rapidly, its layout and public buildings, gave them a substantial identity both general and specific. The former is clearly that of a Hellenic town of the Graeco-Roman Near East with many of the expected features and structures. In detail, however, it soon becomes apparent that geography, history, resources, and choice influenced much that one may still see. Individually such features may not seem particularly significant; collectively they are what gave Gerasa its distinctive character, making it a different town from its neighbours Philadelphia or Pella or Bostra, much less towns more distant. The form of the town Nothing certain is known of the Hellenistic fortifications.57 They undoubtedly existed and would certainly have encircled a relatively modest area. For the first century and half of Roman rule it was probably these Hellenistic defences which defined the shape, extent, and location of the town and influenced its scope for growth. The preferred location for them is in the south-west of the later Roman town, the area around the Oval Piazza and the hills on either side.58 There is little to be gained by speculation, but one new piece of evidence is worth noting. An old air photograph of 1926 shows the distinct outline of two walls outside the south-west corner of the Roman town (pi. 2). They are less clear than the walls of the town and, although they have not yet been traced on the ground, they are constructed on what proved to be a higher hill than any of those inside the town on the west side.59 There is at least one other explanation (below), but the first is that we may here be looking at part of the walls of the Hellenistic citadel, a feature that would have been considerably more notable in Roman times. The same photograph shows the extent and distinctive shape of the city as defined by the familiar and well-preserved outline of the Roman city walls. Although never seen from this striking perspective by the ancient population, in their original condition they would nevertheless have been a highly visible expression of the ambitions and self-image of the population. They encompass no less than 85 ha. Despite the river running through the middle, 1941, 7-14 reaffirmed his earlier view (Fisher-Kraeling apud Kraeling op. cit. [η. 7] 139-48) for an orientalized Greek heroôn. Whatever the nature of this small structure, it remains true that in this vicinity were found dedications naming the deity Pakidas and the Arabian God (Welles apud Kraeling op. cit. (η. 7) 383-6 nos. 17-22). 57 D. Graf, Aram 4, 1992, 1-48 offers a valuable survey of the evidence for the Hellenistic period, concluding that the Decapolis towns were mainly 'fortified villages garrisoned by Greeks and Macedonians' and 'devoid of any of the basic political institutions and civic organizations of the traditional classical Greek city' (34). 58 Graves of the 1st cent, bc and 1st cent, ad were found beneath the later Temple C and Church of St Theodore. They are believed to be part of a larger cemetery which might have extended to beneath the later Temple of Artemis (Kraeling op. cit. 292-3). The implication is that the northern edge of the Late Hellenistic town stopped south of this place. 59 Parts of this buried wall can be detected with difficulty on the 1953 air photographs of Jerash. In 1997, the hill was quite thickly scattered with houses including several of some substance. No trace of the wall was visible in a brief investigation but what appears to be a rock-cut tomb entrance was noted on the south slope. A systematic search is a desideratum.</page><page sequence="19">The Identity of Roman Gerasa 57 the result was not—as one might have expected—an elongated ribbon development, but a polygonal shape roughly as long as broad, extending far up the hills on either side. With the exception of one stretch on the west (which deserves explanation), the wall consists of straight stretches, is punctuated by at least five gates60 and marked all around by at least 101 square towers projecting at regular intervals of 17-22 m. The circuit has till recently commonly been dated to the Flavian period largely on the basis of an inscription found at the North-West Gate61 on the voussoir blocks of a flat lintel.62 The 1st century ad certainly witnessed the major construction work on the Temple of Zeus and the adjacent South Theatre, and the walls have been viewed in the context of this immense effort and the parallel laying out of the town on a grid system (but see below) which conflicts with this area inside the South Gate where the old town seems to have lain. As an expression of civic pride in the very early Roman period these walls would be a remarkable key to the identity of Gerasa. Moreover, they have been seen as part of a process of civic embellishment in the Flavian period.63 The immense circuit of Palmyra has been assigned to this period,64 as have now also the 1.7 km-long walls of Gadara.65 Although the proposal is superficially attractive, the evidence is problematic. At Gerasa the date depends almost entirely on a single inscription attributed to the North-West Gate; at Gadara the publication is recent and brief, and the date imprecise;66 at Palmyra, the walls dated to this period cannot be traced for a full circuit and may never have been completed. Now, on the basis of the extensive excavation of the 1980s, the Flavian date for the walls of Gerasa has been challenged. Seigne has argued persuasively from some detailed observations on the walls, that the visible circuit cannot be pre-Diocletianic and was probably the work of the late 3rd/early 4th century following extensive destruction in the town in the late 3rd century.67 Prior to that, the town was largely open. He presents an image of a city developing around the Oval Piazza and focused on the Temple of Zeus. Development thereafter was linear along the west side, and when development took place in the early 2nd century with an arch erected under Trajan (the later North Gate)68 and two more under Hadrian (the South Gate and Arch of Hadrian), the extension intended was to draw the town out to the south. In Seigne's view, the move northwards only occurred when the massive new Temple of Artemis was constructed in the mid-2nd century and set up a rivalry between supporters of Zeus and the city's patron goddess.69 Development east of the Wadi Jerash only began in earnest in the 3rd century, and it was not till the walls were built c.300 that the form we see emerged. There is much in this of great interest, and it is in any case a bold attempt to bring order to scattered and difficult data and break with the view of Kraeling half a century ago. Nevertheless, it remains problematic in places. The newly identified walls on the hill SW of the Temple of Zeus (above) require explanation and Seigne himself reports evidence of a 60 North and South Gates, South-West and North-West Gates where the North and South Decumani intersect it, and the fifth recently identified at the south-east where the South Decumanus would arrive, if extended (R. Parapetti, Mesopotamia 18/19, 1983-1984, 39). We may suppose a NE gate was provided, perhaps where a substantial road passed through as long ago as 1926. This last would probably have been the original road to Bostra via El-Fedein (above). 61 Kraeling op. cit. 398 no. 50. 62 Cp. G. W.

Kennedy simple wall preceding the monumental South Gate.70 If the city wall at Gadara proves to be 1st century that too will make an early date at Gerasa possible (cf. below, Discussion). Finally, there is the recent observation made at Jerash after some clearance along the western wall. It was noted that dumps of pottery had been placed against the wall in one place and that this included material dated to the late 2nd/early 3rd century. In short, the pottery implies a date earlier than the late 2nd century ad for the wall.71 Closer inspection of the walls reveals two features of significance. First, the character of the walls, even without reference to the gate inscription referred to earlier, has been viewed as probably of the kind intended to be 'as much for decoration and prestige as a defence'.72 They are relatively modest in thickness (3 m) and the towers are only c.6 m square. The overall circuit of c.3.45 km is ambitiously lengthy if a serious defence was intended. Second, the area enclosed is also very extensive; perhaps excessively so. Without detailed survey over the entire interior of the walled area, little more than suggestive points and impressions are available. On the east side of the Wadi Jerash there has never been much evidence for the extent and nature of the structures there. Early photographs taken by Corporal Phillips in 1867 when Jerash was visited by the Palestine Exploration Fund expedition of Captain Warren, reveal little evidence of much there in contrast to the west side. It is commonly thought this area was the domestic counterpart to the monumental centre on the west. One might wonder, however, at the settlement of so steep a region when the western side was still not fully occupied. The latter is implied in the apparent absence of major structures along the area just within the western wall and from the proliferation of churches in precisely that area in later centuries—perhaps making use of areas never previously fully developed. The walls of Jerash may imply an extent and grandeur which is misleading; part η*1 of an early imperial surge in building activity and ambitious plans in the region. Extensive as this circuit is, it seems not to have been the peak of ambition. A further phase of expansion has long been inferred from the arch constructed in the early 2nd century. At either end of this structure there is projecting masonry and at an upper level there is an opening to allow passage through the monument which is only intelligible if intended to link with a wall on either side. The wall was evidently not built—at least on either side of the arch. However, the traces of wall on the old air photograph already discussed (pi. 2) may be raised here as an alternative occasion for their construction. The two stretches of wall may be traced along a line of c.750 m (290 and 460 m for the two stretches). They cannot be seen to link up with the later visible city wall nor do they extend as far as the arch, although the alignment of the lateral stretch would, if extended, carry through to very close to it. As we have seen, these might represent vestiges of an earlier separate fortress commanding the town nearby. With only two sides visible, however, it might equally be part of the wider fortification of the town and, presumably, later than the main circuit.74 Even without this new evidence, it seems clear that a southern extension of the town was intended even if never completed. No trace has been noted on the air photographs east of the arch but a conjectural 70 J. Seigne in: JAP I (1986) 52 fig. 9. 71 I am grateful to Ina Kehrberg for this information. 72 S. Gregory, Roman Military Architecture on the Eastern Frontier, I (1995) 67. 73 Cf. the immense wall circuit of Palmyra (Bowersock art. cit. [η. 62] 135-7) and the Roman walls of Gadara, 1.7 km long, have recently been assigned to the mid-1st cent, ad (Hoffman art. cit. [η. 65] 513). If correct, these dates suggest that the wall at Gerasa might go back to the 1st century, even though the now visible remains are later. 74 It might be argued that the main wall circuit is the outcome of abandoning an earlier, more ambitious circuit, excluding now the hippodrome and the industrial area. That seems precluded, however, by the date for the Arch (period of Hadrian) and of the South Gate (see below).</page><page sequence="21">The Identity of Roman Gerasa 59 line is shown in plate 2. Once again, such an extension has to be seen in the context of the massive building work on the monumental heart of the town where the great Temple of Artemis was going up and work was in progress on the associated structures. Furthermore, it was now, too, that the circus was begun. As noted below, the early 2nd century was when milestones were erected along at least two of the four major highways between Gerasa and its neighbours. Finally, there is the question of the orientation of the town. The north/south alignment of the river suggests the direction for the main thoroughfare but not inevitably so: an east/west street could have been as long and grand as the cardo. We may note, too, that of the five known gates it was the North and South Gates which were monumentalized; there is nothing especially notable about the North-West Gate, and that on the east—from which the road to Bostra began—has never stood out, although that stretch of wall was, till recently, quite well preserved. The triumphal arch was placed astride the road on the south. The implication of this physical evidence is that the orientation of the town was towards neighbours to north and south rather than east or west. And of those, Philadelphia to the south may have been viewed as the more important. An aspect of orientation relates to the suggested development of .the region between Gerasa and Bostra. As links with Roman Bostra developed after ad 106, traffic arriving at Gerasa on the bank opposite the town may have given an impetus to development there. Certainly, little is datable from that area before the 3rd century.76 Colonnaded streets The identity of a town may be conditioned, too, by its layout. Gerasa was, after various developments and extensions, a planned town with broad colonnaded streets in a rectilinear pattern. The pattern was broken sharply by the river which created an internal division into two broadly equal parts. Only two bridges have been identified. There are hints of the ancient layout in the eastern part but there is uncertainty as to whether it was aligned with that on the 11 west or on a different grid. Although a broadly rectangular and rectilinear layout may seem unexceptional, in fact Gerasa may in this respect have been at variance with what we know of most of its neighbours. In some instances there is too little evidence to be certain but in others the overall pattern is clear. There is no evidence for an extensive rectilinear layout at Philadelphia, Pella, Gadara, Capitolias, Dium, Abila, or even across the Jordan at Scythopolis. The hills and valleys prevented more than local pockets of order. The people of Gerasa were almost alone in a wide region in living in an extensively orthogonal city. But is there more to it? Seigne has argued recently that we are misled by superficial appearance into seeing a Classical layout and compound the error by the modern designation of the principal axes as the decumanus and cardo. Rather, he argues, the 'decumanus' was the monumentalization of an ancient oriental processional way leading south to the Temple of Zeus. Later, in the second half of the 2nd century ad or after, the Temple of Artemis was monumentalized and a processional way to it established.78 75 The earliest datable milestones from each of these roads may be suggestive: Pella (112), Philadelphia (112—but one Trajanic stone employs the term refecit, implying an earlier date for the original construction), Adraha/Bostra (121), and Bostra (214). Pella would have been linked by road to Gerasa sooner than Adraha and Bostra simply because it had been Roman and presumably already had a road connection. Bostra and Adraha involved travel through regions only recently brought under Roman control. 76 Seigne art. cit. (η. 51) 332 and η. 9; 339 and η. 52; 341 and nn. 58 and 60. 77 R. Parapetti.

Kennedy The visitor to Jerash is impressed by the lengthy colonnades along both the main thoroughfare and the two main cross streets. Abundant shade would have been desirable and the extensive porticoes would have been a striking feature of the town. But again, all may not have been as it seems. Recent analysis, noting the survival in many places of the architrave connecting the columns, has drawn attention to the absence of the expected frieze and cornice.79 This was not, however, a mere façade with columns set against the wall of the building and connected to it by ressauts as at the Library of Hadrian at Athens or the Severan basilica at Leptis Magna.79® The pedestrian walkway behind the columns is present but may never have been roofed; if so, as Parapetti suggests, it may have been covered by awnings or matting, creating the impression more of a colourful bazaar. The impression would have been rather different from the Classical canon. Here, too, ambitious plans may have ended in a permanently unfinished appearance.80 The arch Just beyond the south-east corner of the hippodrome lay an arch (pi. 3: 2), a structure Wheeler called 'a symbol of Empire' and viewed as an 'eloquent and powerful expression of period-mentality'.81 Many arches had no utilitarian function—even those set into walls were open passageways rather than functioning gates. Most were utilitarian only within the context of aesthetics and symbolism. They might—Wheeler again—be regarded as 'monstrous toys'. The role of arches as inviting, open entrances at intersections and astride the internal thoroughfares of towns is well-established. Those which lay outside the town astride the highway approaching a major gate are usually distinguished not as civic arches but 'imperial "triumphal"—usually honorary or commemorative'.82 Some were designed to signal the significance of the space beyond, and that may be what we should see at Jerash. Although the inscription on this arch is problematic,83 it certainly supports this definition, as it states that 'the city of Antioch-on-the-Chrysorhoas, formerly Gerasa, (has erected) this arch with triumph from (funds supplied by) the will of Flavius Agrippa'. The arch is notable, matching in height (c.21 m) the Arch of Constantine in Rome, the tallest known.84 The location of the triumphal arch also suggests that this southern road was the most important in the life of the town, linking it to its neighbour, Philadelphia, 36 km away. That is by no means obvious—the highway to Pella, Scythopolis, and the Mediterranean might have been thought more important for a city looking towards the heartland of the world in which it stood. The role of such arches, however, should be viewed rather from the perspective of the arriving traveller. The monumental free-standing arch was a symbol of Roman urban architecture and at Gerasa the Hadrianic date of the text is surely to be linked in some way 79 Parapetti art. cit. (η. 60) 66-9. 79a W. L. MacDonald, The Architecture of the Roman Empire, II: An Urban Appraisal (1986) 201-2. 80 Another feature reported at Jerash seems to be an error. At Palmyra almost every column along the main colonnaded street bore a bracket on which once stood a bronze statue. The practice is paralleled elsewhere in the East at Pompeiopolis and Diocaesarea in Cilicia, at Apamea-on-the-Orontes, at Dura Europos, and at Hatra in Mesopotamia. The origin of the practice is unknown; however, it is clearly eastern, possibly Mesopotamian—certainly north Syrian, and unexpected so far to the south of all other known examples. This 'vulgar outrage', as L. Woolley called them, is reported, too, at Gerasa but recent inspection found no examples. It seems that early observors misinterpreted the brackets which undoubtedly exist on some columns of the decumanus. These, however, project not into the street but laterally and, as the reconstructions make clear, were to support the beams of the entablature where there were differences in height along the street. 81 R.

Kennedy with the actual visit of Hadrian in 128/9.85 Such arches were intended also to mark an approach and provide a vista which altered as one came closer and was confronted with a larger view. In this instance, the traveller looked through a strikingly large Roman monument towards the very similar South Gate about 450 m away (pi. 3: 2).86 The left side of the route between arch and gate was paralleled for much of its length—the angle of view would probably have made it seem more—by the tall external east wall of the circus pierced along its length by a succession of openings, the whole in the attractive honey-coloured stone of the region (cf. fig. 8). Arch, circus, and gate are characteristically Roman in concept even if the decoration and inscription (invisible to the arriving traveller) of the arch were Greek and the circus used for Greek-style games (see below). One might guess at a milestone here, too,87 and those were not just Roman in concept but largely in Latin, the surviving examples monumental in design, standing c.2 m high. Even when it ceased to have an aesthetic function the arch remained, an enduring and permanent reminder etched into the landscape, greeting the traveller from the south for the next five centuries and still today an arresting introduction to the city beyond. The hippodrome/circus Plainly the town offered considerable scope for entertainment, which may in some respects have made it a regional centre, attracting spectators from beyond its own territory. Theatres were common in the Decapolis cities, several, like Gerasa, having two. The South and North Theatres at Gerasa provided seating for some 3000 and 1600 respectively and the small so called Festival Theatre at Birketein just north of the city added yet more. The hippodrome could seat 16,000. All these structures belong to the Early Roman period and are essentially Roman in design. The hippodrome is the smallest (306 m external length) yet found anywhere in the entire empire. The design includes such Roman features as the towers beside the starting gates—a western feature only securely paralleled in the East at Antioch but giving an oo # overall impression of 'a miniature of a western circus'. On the other hand, the function seems to have been non-Roman. In place of the characteristic layout required for Roman-style racing whose four factions required 12 gates, there are only ten at Gerasa. The conclusion is that this was a Roman circus but adapted for Greek-style racing in which teams were entered by professional organizations rather than factions.89 For a time Gerasa could boast the means for hosting chariot racing. There were other circuses in the region but none is known at its nearest major neighbours of the Decapolis, Pella and Philadelphia. Although the circus figures prominently in the visible remains and on the plans of the town, it functioned for only a brief period. Recent excavation has placed construction extending across the second half of the 2nd century and not completed until perhaps the early 3rd. The excavators noted, however, that part of the south-west seating collapsed in the 3rd century or earlier,90 limiting the scope for racing. By the late 3rd/early 4th century the entire area had been given over to manufacture and dumping of waste material.91 In short, chariot racing at Gerasa was not at all what it might superficially seem to 85 The basis of the early 2nd-cent. date assigned to the South Gate is precisely its similarity to the Arch of Hadrian. 86 On the same orientation and possibly just to be glimpsed, was the Temple of Artemis (Parapetti loc. cit. [η. 77]) but it was probably only beginning to be built in the period after Hadrian's visit. 87 Rasson-Seigne-Seigne op. cit. (η. 25) 197. 88 J. H. Humphrey, Roman Circuses.

The building was a circus rather than hippodrome but its use was Greek rather than Roman, in a structure which seems to have been poorly engineered and soon sagged and collapsed never to be repaired. It was very small and it had only a short life. The period during which Gerasa could boast of this functioning symbol of its Romanitas was brief. The remains may allow us also to see another aspect of the inhabitants conducting themselves in a fashion attested widely in the Greek cities of the East. The hippodrome lies just south of the South Gate but its limited length was deliberate; there was ample space (c.450 m) between the gate and the monumental arch which had been built before the circus was begun. Arch, circus, and South Gate form a striking series of monuments even today as one approaches from the direction of Philadelphia. To achieve it, parts of the cemetery outside the South Gate, including monumental tombs, had to be demolished and partially over-built.92 An almost identical arrangement can be viewed at another Decapolis city. Gadara (modern Umm Qeis) lies 100 km to the NNW. Although less well-preserved than Gerasa, Gadara also boasted two theatres and many important public buildings. Recent excavations have revealed that on the west side of the town, where the main road to Tiberias struck off across an open and level plateau before making the steep descent into the Jordan Valley, extensive work was carried out. A monumental West Gate was succeeded 350 m further west by a free-standing monumental arch. Between the two has been traced the northern part of what appears to be a hippodrome. Little of the last has been excavated but the surviving section was 283 m in length. Dating evidence is slim for any of these features. The arch has been assigned to around ad 200. Individually, arches and extra-mural circuses are not uncommon but the combination of the two and the layout alongside a road from what was probably the principal gate in each instance is striking. The arches are not at all alike and that at Gadara may be later; the dimensions of the Gadara hippodrome as reconstructed would be some 293 m for the arena alone, compared with 244 m at Gerasa. Gadara seems here to be engaged in an attempt at peer polity interaction, imitating and outdoing its southern neighbour. It was apparently unsuccessful: excavations have now concluded that the northern section was never completed and no southern section ever begun.94 Although the site is well preserved and extensively explored, no amphitheatre has ever been identified at Gerasa. Amphitheatres were, of course, rare in the East and, until recently, none was known in the southern Near East beyond the river Jordan.943 Now there is one reported at Bostra.95 That need occasion no surprise in what was a major legionary centre. Elsewhere in the region, however, it is likely that the gladiatorial and wild beast shows of the amphitheatre were staged in other settings. No written source specifically points to such activities at Gerasa. However, the physical remains of the circus show that it underwent modification which involved cutting off the northern third with a curving wall roughly mirroring the existing curving north end of the structure (pi. 2). It has been interpreted as intended for polo but one might more naturally view it in the same light as the similar alterations to stadia in Asia Minor where part was employed for gladiatorial fights.96 More 1991, 237-50; id, AJA 97, 1993, 498-500; 99, 1995, 524-5; id. loc. cit.

Kennedy importantly, the recent extensive excavations at Scythopolis (Bet Shean), just across the Jordan from Pella, have revealed an early 3rd-century structure which is almost identical in design—a rectangle with rounded ends. It is explicitly identified by the excavators as an amphitheatre but one whose form 'indicates that it was originally planned as a hippodrome' 97 Further south at Neapolis in Palestine is an even closer parallel in the nearly identical layout of circus-with amphitheatre built into one end.97a More recently still, at Caesarea Maritima where literary sources claimed Herod the Great constructed an amphitheatre, it now seems clear the term was used loosely to indicate an open place with seating around it— apparently the 'stadium' recently excavated, a 'multi-purpose entertainment building'.98 D. AN ENDURING DIVERSITY Geography and environment made Gerasa a distinctive place—a well-watered garden town, enjoying a relatively mild Mediterranean climate and set amidst the remnants of more ancient pine and oak forests. All around were hills, those on the west rising quite sharply to the dominating peak of the region at Ajlun before falling over a thousand metres to the floor of the Jordan valley. It was to the hills, too, that the population of Roman Gerasa looked for the political boundaries of their community, marked by the major watersheds. Their immediate world was a limited one, their political boundaries little more than half a day distant; on the east perhaps only an hour away. Seven centuries of Roman rule brought notable changes. The landscape became more intensively settled and exploited and all-weather roads were built. In Gerasa itself, the small Hellenistic town west of the river was developed into a new town, several times larger and stretching north and south well beyond the original nucleus. In time it extended across the river and, later still, it was defined by walls to symbolize its autonomy, advertise its ambitions, regulate access, and mark out the line between urban and rural life, the living and the dead. The visible walls may have proved over-ambitious but the hints on the south side suggest development might once have been more ambitious still. The arch there was certainly one of the tallest ever built and its location may imply the link with Philadelphia as the most important. The combination of arch, circus, and remodelled South Gate point to a conscious effort to create an impressive urban vista. The form is largely Roman in design if details are Greek. The visitor approaching Gerasa in the early 3rd century would be confronted by an impressive triumphal arch, whose opening invited passage to what lay beyond. From the arch itself the viewer then confronted a striking vista: the long wall of the circus drawing the eye for half a kilometre to the South Gate, similar in design to the arch. Above but to the left of the South Gate was the striking temple and precinct of Zeus, set obliquely on an eminence. More distant but directly above the South Gate and on the same alignment as arch, road, and gate, the massive Temple of Artemis, 'one of the major monuments of Roman religious architecture in the Near East',99 was under way in the 2nd century. But all was not as it seemed. The arch itself had been designed for a different purpose. The circus was a curiously modest addition to a space for which it had not been intended, it was slow in completion and soon collapsed, in part through shoddy design and building. Though 97 G.

Once again, however, it may be that, as suggested for other eastern centres, circuses could be used for athletic contests and vice versa. 97a For illustrations of the Neapolis and Skythopolis amphitheatres see Weiss art. cit. 41. 98 Y.

That, too, was seemingly short lived and by the late 3rd century what had been designed as a component in a grandiose scheme for urban development was turned over to the dirt, smoke, and smells of pottery production and leather-working. Opposite the circus, monumental tombs had been demolished as part of the plan but the area seems never to have been redeveloped. In practical terms the southern extension of the town had failed and extra-mural industry had taken over. The townspeople lived with that failure for the next three centuries—the grandeur advertised by the arch proved on closer inspection to be rather seedy. The identity of a community is a product not just of what went on within its boundaries but the character of its neighbours, how those changed, and the nature and extent of interaction (fig. 8). On the level of the long-term structures one can see notable differences. Philadelphia, 300 m higher but on the edge of the steppe, was never far from the desert, even after settlement expanded eastwards. The Wadi Amman is seldom more than a modest stream. The town probably looked north-west to Gerasa and—increasingly and after the Via Nova Traiana was built and studded with forts and growing villages—north to Bostra. Gadara was at a far lower level than Gerasa, close to one of the great inland lakes of the Near East and perched above the junction of two of its major rivers. Climatic conditions were merely semi arid but it was hot in contrast to Gerasa. Below sea level, conditions at Pella were fully arid and hot, but it lay in a fertile locality, only 40 minutes from the Jordan. Even without the provincial boundary which placed Pella and Gadara in Palaestina, both of those places were likely by location to look towards the lands west of the Jordan and the Mediterranean beyond. Bostra was distant and looked more to the great cereal-growing lands of the Hauran than the constricted but rich and varied soils of its western neighbours. Its administrative role, large military component, great territorial extent, and the numerous and large well-built villages made Bostra a distinctive place. The places looked different. Not just the different urban form where the ribbon development of Gadara contrasts with, ultimately, the 'square' outline of Gerasa. The people of Philadelphia lived amidst the gleaming pale yellow stone of the vicinity, those of Gerasa the rich honey-coloured local rock; in sharp contrast the people of Gadara and Bostra were surrounded by the gloomy black basalt from which they built (fig. 8). What they built for themselves varied too: the small circus at Gerasa was short-lived and easily eclipsed by that of Bostra; but none has ever been found at Philadelphia, Scythopolis settled for a small and unusual amphitheatre which Gerasa later emulated; and Gadara began work on a large circus but abandoned it before even a single side was complete. These were towns with shared ambitions beyond their resources but the outcomes were different. As for the one area of interaction explored, it is probable Gerasa experienced a significant alteration in its relationship with its eastern neighbour and perhaps even witnessed eastwards orientation in its view of its world. The steady transformation of a deep belt of land east of Gerasa from semi-pastoralism to one strewn with large agricultural villages can hardly have failed to impact on it. If its Decapolis neighbours with their planned layouts and civic amenities remained the group with which Gerasans preferred to identify, the world of villages on their east was immediate, prosperous, part of their administrative region and lay between them and the provincial centre at Bostra. They shared the Greek language and, later, Christianity, but they were very different in other respects: an economy largely devoted to cereals and stock-raising, a necessary pre-occupation with harvesting and storing water, tall houses built with little timber and flat roofed,100 people more overtly Semitic even in name 100 There is uncertainty about the character of housing at Gerasa.

Kennedy according to the numerous inscriptions, the significance of a native Nabataean origin, and the prominence of the military in their past and present. This was a region with its own identity and if it was beyond the formal boundaries of Gerasa it was very much part of their everyday world. Of all the factors working to shape and develop Gerasa's evolving identity over the several centuries of Roman rule, there were probably few more important than the extent and nature of the changes which took place in these steppe lands. E. DISCUSSION Researching this paper revealed both the strengths and limitations of what is currently known of the material culture of Gerasa and what we may infer from it. The most obvious weakness is that so much that is visible is inadequately recorded and analysed and so much of what is recorded is unpublished. Of the former, perhaps the most remarkable is that so little is known of the entire east side of the town.101 More generally, the extensive and well-preserved walls, 1 (Y) · · reported on by Seigne, should be systematically examined and recorded. Beyond the walls, the acknowledged potential of mortuary archaeology will remain limited while we lack even a map of the known cemeteries much less any systematic recording.103 The urgency of both these features is sharpened by the activities of bulldozers around and just beyond the walls. Of known and recorded material one thinks primarily of the immense quantities of artefactual evidence—the 6 million sherds recovered from the hippodrome may stand as a proxy for smaller but still abundant collections of pottery, glass, metalwork, coins, and much else.104 Beyond the town, there is a desperate need for survey. Ideally one would aim to record everything within the relatively limited territory of the city as above defined. Much could be achieved relatively cheaply by aerial survey and systematic analysis of the many existing air photographs.105 More important, however, would be an intensive survey.106 Recent similar work in northern Jordan along the Wadi Yabis and Zerqa107 and now that in progress around Pella reaffirm the significant transformation that can occur in our view of great towns like north-east of the town but even in Gerasa itself they are far less evident than one would expect by comparison with urban sites elsewhere and may be concentrated in the vicinity of public buildings. 101 Arguably it is on the east that future exploration should focus to salvage what may be revealed around and beneath the houses of modern Jerash. Seigne loc. cit. (η. 51) reports having kept a watching brief on development in the modern town of Jerash east of the W. Jerash over several years. His comments there are trenchant and underscore the need for such work on a systematic basis. See also the notice of unpublished discoveries made north of the East Baths (Gatier loc. cit.

A sample will illustrate how archaeology can be at the forefront of such inquiry. Inevitably most of what has been most fully published relates to the monumental parts of the town. As one recent reviewer put it, however, 'architectural history should be more than the counting of columns and the measuring of stylobates ... [architectural historians too seldom] relate their monuments properly to a wider context'.110 The major thoroughfares of Gerasa would benefit from an analysis which placed them within a regional context of urban streets and identified and explained the differences. The recent work by Segal on the theatres of the region helpfully defines them all as Roman rather than Greek and explains the probability of their being used primarily for the popular but often licentious mime rather than the great plays of Classical Athens.111 Segal, too, notes the evidence for the adaptation of some for water 11 ^ theatre. More might be done here to clarify and explain the numerous differences and their varying structural history. More prosaically, it would be of immense benefit in developing an identity or identities for Roman Gerasa to be able to investigate houses at various dates—their orientation, shape, layout, decoration, amenities, economy, and what may be inferred from these about the society, its tastes and inspirations, and how they compare with those of earlier and contemporary communities.113 No analysis exists of the economy of Gerasa. Rostovtzeff famously characterized it as a 'Caravan City',114 but that now seems exaggerated as scholars recognize the overwhelming role of agriculture in the life of most cities. There has been little discussion of the implications of the archaeological evidence for the economic life of any of the Decapolis cities.115 Anecdotal evidence for linen-weavers, potters, tanners, and glass workers offers slight insight.116 Pottery can help through, for example, systematic identification of sources of amphorae: was wine (and oil and fish sauce) imported and from where; and to what extent did geography inhibit or direct trade? How did that compare with 117 118 neighbouring cities? Despite the recent excavation of the macellum, even the domestic economy is largely blank. There are no analyses of food refuse available from the extensive recent excavations. Yet, what people ate and how is a guide to culture and it would be instructive to be able to identify the types and range of cooking and table wares at different dates. 108 P.

She observes that the same pattern may be true of other Decapolis cities. Local production of such an item implies limited trade in the finished product if not in the raw materials (vitreous sand or raw glass). 118 A. Uscatescu-M.

Much less well known are the more private beliefs of the community. Now the question has been posed as to whether the Temple of Zeus stood where a more ancient divinity had been worshipped.119 Beyond that remarkably little can be said about belief at the level of popular culture. The unusual discovery of a large number of terracotta statuettes from a potter's workshop half a century ago is surely one aspect of this and it would be instructive to determine the role of such items and place them in the context of both Classical culture and • 1 9Π ancient Near Eastern tradition. An interesting recent discovery has been of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vases of the late 6th century. They represent a continuation—or revival in the Classical period—of the production (now wheel-made) of an older Near Eastern tradition, the human figures having a distinctly oriental flavour as found also on a fresco at Abila and on Jerash bowls.121 We may never know if Gerasa was as marked in its public places by phallic symbols as was Pompeii (and presumably other Roman cities), but we should be able to learn more about rural shrines. Beliefs include taboos and here again a systematic analysis of what is known of the art of Gerasa could be illuminating. For example, Patrich has argued recently for the extensive persistence of a ban on human representation in art in the Nabataean realm and that may explain the contrast between the tombstones of Gerasa (and the region) which bear epitaphs only and those of northern Syria 1 ΛΛ and Asia Minor where figures and even family scenes were popular. Likewise, the animal bone assemblage might reveal the presence or absence of a dietary taboo. These are all practical and attainable studies which, in the absence of direct evidence for such other 1 Λ-1 defining features of identity as local tastes in music, dance, humour, and even much relating to popular art, can and should be pursued. The evidence is fragmentary and the burden on those who have the expertise to publish everything from monumental architecture to ceramics is immense. Those of us who are 'users' of such reports may be able to help by posing the questions we want such studies to answer. Much of what contributed to defining the identity of a community at any point in its life will never be known or the subject only of conjecture. Sadly we lack the impressions of the acute Hadrian. Would he have found Gerasa a place with its own distinct characteristics—not just the material aspects of the city but of smell, colour, and sound; the prominence or otherwise of women and children in public; the appearance of its people, their favoured costume, how they groomed their hair, and what perfumes they preferred; their accents, choice of vocabulary, mannerisms; concepts of honour and rank; how they celebrated births, coming of age, and marriage; attitudes towards sex and how, emotionally, they dealt with death; their treatment of slaves and animals; and how these had changed and developed since the 2nd century ... and were to alter again in subsequent generations? We should not underestimate the force of such characteristics in creating an identity. Goody has revealed the significance of the role of flowers in societies, reminding us of the potential of even a seemingly unlikely feature of culture—one, moreover, about which archaeology could offer some insights.124 119 J. Seigne-F. Braemer, DossAParis 1987, 57. 120 J. H. Iliffe, QDAP 11, 1945, 1-26. Ina Kehrberg (pers. comm.) reports further fragments of statuettes and moulds from recent excavations at Gerasa. We may look forward to significant developments as the statuettes from Gadara are the subject of a PhD thesis by Nadine Riedl of the German Protestant Institute at Amman. 121 E. de Montlivaut, DossAParis 1987, 54. 122 J. Patrich, The Formation of Nabataean Art. Prohibition of a Graven Image Among the Nabateans (1995). 123 What actually went on in the theatres of the region is largely inferred from what is known to have been popular more widely and from the strictures of Jewish and Christian writers about what they regarded as immoral (Segal op. cit [n. Ill] 12-15). 124 J. Goody, The Culture of Flowers (1993).</page><page sequence="31">The Identity of Roman Gerasa 69 Like Morns' Delhi, Roman Gerasa was a place of great antiquity, predating the Hellenistic foundation then creating its own monuments, some then forgotten but a lingering and defining part of the evolving identities of the city as it passed through colonization, the imposition of Roman rule, monumentalization, the introduction of Christianity, and the Muslim takeover. No less significant were the less dramatic, largely unseen developments which archaeology has the potential to illuminate. More than most ancient sites, Gerasa and its hinterland is a place where questions may be answered. From the outset, however, it is necessary to remind oneself of the likelihood that the place was different in many small ways from its neighbours. Moreover, despite the seeming familiarity of much one encounters, it would have been a profoundly alien place to readers of this discussion. Wiseman's recent cautionary observation about the 'insidious' nature of inferences from features that are too familiar was applied to the city of Rome itself but is a suitable point on which to conclude: Studying ancient Rome should be like visiting some teeming capital in a dangerous and ill-governed foreign country; nothing can be relied on, most of what you see is squalid, sinister or unintelligible, and you are disproportionately grateful when you find something you can recognise as familiar.125 125 T.
