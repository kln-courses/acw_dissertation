<plain_text><page sequence="1">Henri Poincar?, Wissenschaft und Hypothese. Autorisierte deutsche Ausgabe mit erl?uternden Anmerkungen. Von F. und L. Lindenmnn. Leipsic : B. G. Teubner. 1904. Professor Ferdinand Lindemann, one of the leading mathematicians of Germany, has undertaken the laudable task of translating a series of essays written by his French colleague, Prof. Henri Poincar?, and Mrs. Lindemann,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS. 613 the translator's wife, has done so much of the literary labor of the work that her name also appears on the title-page. Poincar?'s position in the philosophy of mathematics is in its main out lines well known to mathematicians and perhaps also to those of our readers who have studied the essays which he contributed to The Monist, but we offer here a r?sum? in quotations, methodically compiled by Professor Linde mann, which covers almost the entire field and affords a bird's-eye view of Professor Poincar?'s position as regards the foundation of geometry and arithmetic and the definition of mechanics. Professor Lindemann selects the following passages from Poincar? as specially characteristic :1 " Our understanding has a direct conception of the power of mind (which implies the conviction that an infinite repetition of the same procedure can be imagined), and experience can he only an opportunity to make use of it and to become conscious of it." (Page 13.) This is good Kantian doctrine according to which experience is not the main source of our knowledge. But let us proceed in our quotations : "The geometrical axioms are neither synthetic judgments a priori nor experimental facts. They are determinations based upon general consent, which is to say, they are concealed definitions. Geometry is not a science of experience, though experience guides us in the proposition of axioms. Experi ence does not decide which geometry is the right one but which is the most convenient one. It is just as irrational to investigate whether the fundamental principles of geometry are true or false as it would be to ask whether the metric systems be wrong or false." (Pages 51, 73, and 138.) Next in order are three quotations on physics and mechanics : " The law of gravitation which in some special cases has been proved by experience can be boldly universalised, because we know that in all cases experience can neither prove nor disprove it." (Page 99.) " The principle of action and reaction being equal cannot be regarded as. an experimental law but only as a definition." (Page 102.) " Experience can serve as a basis for the principles of mechanics but it can never contradict them." (Page 107.) " The principles of mechanics are based on consent and are concealed definitions. They are derived from experimental laws. These laws are, as it were, presented as principles, for our understanding attributes to them absolute validity." (Page 140.) Without taking exception to Poincar?'s statements as to the validity of a universalisation of gravitation, we wonder at the argument which he adduces in its favor. That experience can neither prove nor disprove a generalisation, is no sufficient reason to make us bold. Further, that experience can never 1 The pages in parentheses refer to Professor Lindemann's translation.</page><page sequence="3">6i4 THE MONIST. contradict the principles of mechanics is exactly the crux of the main problem. Finally, we must express our doubt as to the propriety of two terms, viz., " consent " and " definition." Both are employed by Poincar? and occur in the last quoted passage. It is not a mere " consent " if the physicist claims an absolute validity for his principles of mechanics, and mathematical axioms are more than " definitions " ; they are definitions, the formulation of which is inevitably forced upon the mathematician. Their inevitableness is their most significant feature. After this digression we revert to Poincar? : " If one wants to regard the principle of the conservation of energy in its sweeping universality and apply it to the universe, one sees it as it were volatilised and nothing remains except the sentence : ' There is a something that remains constant.'" (Page 134.) "Experiment is the sole source of truth." (Page 142.) This statement must be understood so as not to contradict previous propo sitions savoring of Kantian apriorism. It means simply that experiment is the sole method of extending our knowledge of facts, for Poincar? adds that experiment must be improved. Something has to be added. He says : " Mathematical physics has the duty to guide generalisation so as to increase the efficiency of science." (Page 144.) " Each generalisation presupposses to a certain extent the faith in the unity and simplicity of nature." " But " adds he, " it is not sure that nature is simple." (Page 152.) We conclude this summary of Poincar?'s views with three more passages : " The purpose of mathematical science is not to explain the true nature of things. Her sole aim is to interconnect physical laws with which experience makes us acquainted, but which cannot be expressed without the assistance of mathematics." (Page 212.) " We care little whether ether really exists. It is essential, however, that everything happens as if it existed and that this hypothesis is convenient for an explanation of phenomena." (Page 212.) " The goal which it is possible for science to attain is a cognition of things in their interrelations. Outside of these relations there is no cognisable reality." (Page xiii.) Professor Lindemann adds in characterisation of Poincar?'s standpoint : " The reader will notice that we have thus returned to Kant's proposition, according to which the understanding does not derive laws from nature but prescribes them to nature and that the highest legislator of nature lies in ourselves, i. e., in our understanding or, as Goethe expresses it : ' Everything transient is but a simile,'?a simile which refers to the same thought if one is conscious of the relativity of all knowledge. All such universal propositions</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS. 615 are possessed of a high subjective significance, for they satisfy in a certain sense our need of a completion of inquiry and cognition. For the empirical inquirer, however, there is no such completion. Every general proposition needs according to him a continued investigation under the guidance of experi ence, and to him it is valid only so long as he finds himself in agreement with experience, whether we have to deal with a universal necessity of our mind or with a special doctrine of the exact sciences." * * * " Even those who do share the purely empirical standpoint " adds Professor Lindemann, " will feel the need of pursuing the leading principles throughout all the intricate paths of the exact sciences, and they will gladly accept the guidance of the author (Poincar?) in order to temporarily remove the exuberant vines of detail and to gain an outlook upon the interstices between the firm tree trunks of experience for the sake of orientation. The apparent ease with which our author attains his aim is the main cause that will prove attractive; it did so at least with me. " We must not lay main stress upon the results gained in the present work but upon the method of treatment, and the method which has been pursued by M. Poincar? is the one which during the last decades has led to satisfactory results in the field of the foundations of geometry and arithmetic. It consists in replacing an hypothesis, admissible according to our experience, when its relation to other theories is to be investigated, by an assumption which would satisfy our logical thought without agreeing with experience. In this way we are enabled to make the mutual dependence of the different hypotheses or axioms conceptually evident." Professor Lindemann has not only selected essays which allow us to understand Poincar?'s thought as a systematic whole, but has also added to them explanations and notes and in addition furnished literary references for a further study of the several questions. Considering the difficulties of the translation in which Mrs. Lindemann has been a faithful helpmeet to her husband, we must acknowledge that the work could scarcely be surpassed. The work reads as if it had originally been written in German. The subject-matter of the work is discussed in four parts: L, number and magnitude; II., space; III., "Kraft" (i. e., force or energy) ; IV., nature. The first part contains articles on the nature of mathematical and syllo gistic deduction, verification and proof, the elements of arithmetic, algebraic methods, recurrence, induction, mathematical construction, mathematical mag nitude and experience, the incommensurable, the physical, and the mathe matical continuum, measurable magnitude, the physical and the mathematical continuum of many dimensions. The second part discusses such subjects as the several non-Euclidean</page><page sequence="5">6i6 THE MONIST. geometries, those of Lobatchevski and of Riemann, that of curved space, and the fourth geometry, so called, and Lie's proposition. Further, geometrical space and space conception, the space of vision, the space of touch, and of motion, change of place, solid objects and geometry, the laws of homogeneity, the non-Euclidean world, the four-dimensional world, geometry and astronomy, law and relativity, the applicability of experiment, and a ventila tion of the question, " What is a point?" Among the articles treated in the third part are the following: the prin ciple of inertia, the law of acceleration, anthropomorphic mechanics, the school of the thread (referring to Andrade's method which implies the use of a thread), relative and absolute motion, the methods of Newton, energy and thermo-dynamics. The fourth part opens with a discussion of the significance of experiment and generalisation, the unity of nature, the use of hypothesis, the origin of mathematical physics, the theories of modern physics, physics and mechani calism, the present state of science, the calculus of probabilities, rouge et noir, the probability of causes, the theory of mistakes, etc., optics and electricity, Fresnel's and Maxwell's theories, the mechanical explanation of physical phenomena, electro-dynamics, Amp?re's and Helmholtz's theories and their difficulties, Maxwell's theories, Rowland's experiments, and Lorentz's theory. The annotations by Professor Lindemann are a valuable addition com prising ninety pages, almost one-third of the whole volume. The work is important for the student of mathematics and especially the philosophy of mathematics, for it summarises the life work of a prominent thinker along these lines.</page></plain_text>
