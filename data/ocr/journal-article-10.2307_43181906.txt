Max is the pet of a girl named Tori, and throughout the story she is a strong presence as she explains to Max much of the current state of knowledge about the red planet in language that will be understandable to young readers. Of course, the mission is a great success, and Max makes a key contribution. There are many wonderful aspects to this book. It works well on the level of a space adventure. Its brisk plot is enhanced both by Alan Okamoto's colorful illustrations and by clearly explained scientific information. At no time does author Jeffrey Bennett, an astrophysicist and former NASA scien- tist, talk down to his young audience. He presents abundant and accessible, factual material within the context of the plot. Bennett includes 22 "Big Kid Boxes" in the book. In these sections, the interested older reader (teacher) can learn about specific areas of interest, such as the history of animals in space, past and present robotic Mars missions, the reasons for the colors of the Martian sky, and the challenges that will be faced by humans embarking on an expedition that will probably occupy several years. There's also a box explaining that Max has clearly doglike behaviors (such as concentrating on a squirrel behind Tori's head as she patiently explains science to him), so the book avoids the trap of anthropomorphism. Max Goes To Mors will serve the elementary classroom both as a good story and as an astronomy reference. Cary Seidman Science teacher</page></plain_text>
