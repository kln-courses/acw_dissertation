<plain_text><page sequence="1">Our article on the Makonde (Vol. III, No. 1) has provoked more response than most essays we have run. Professor Lyndon Harries, who is currently the Chairman of African Languages and Literature at the University of Wiscon- sin, has spent many years in East Africa as a missionary. He is now recognized as a major authority on Swahili and other aspects of East African linguistics. His response to Mrs. Shore-Bos' article adds another scholarly dimension to the study of these gifted people. My own interest in the subject of the Makonde derives first from my residence in Southern Tanzania, five of the ten years on the Makonde Plateau itself. While living along the Rovuma River I wrote a grammar of Mozambique Ma- konde, published by the University of Witwatersrand Press, besides writing a detailed account of the initiation rites of the Tanzanian Makonde, published by the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute. I have frequently visited the Tanzanian Ma- konde since ceasing to be a more perma- nent resident in 1945, and my most re- cent visit was in 1968. In that year I was given special permission by the Tanza- nian government to visit the restricted area. Mrs. Shore-Bos fails to make clear that the Tanzanian and the Mozam- bique Makonde who live on the Ma- konde Plateau are separated not only geographically by the Rovuma River Valley but sociologically by differences of ethnicity, culture and even of lan- guage. They are distinct peoples who share the name Makonde because they live on the divided plateau of that name. The Tanzanian Makonde call their neighbors by a name derived from the Makonde verb kuviha, to be angry, and although this is not a complimentary designation it is used by many Mozam- bique Makonde of themselves. The Mozambique Makonde are easily recognizable and differentiated from the Tanzanian Makonde by their heavy tat- too markings. Significantly the Makonde from Mozambique do not cross the river to live on the plateau in Tanzania, but they prefer to migrate to the Tanzanian plain-country. Only the Mozambique Makonde carve in wood. Both tribes, for they are separate tribes, make masks of a different kind. The Tanzanian Ma- konde make helmet masks which are worn by the stilt-dancers as part of their costume. The Mozambique Makonde have a more sophisticated mask, much more elaborate, worn by the dancer who represents a spirit in the dance known generally along the Rovuma as unyago, Continued on page 7 we very much regret... that our experiment in publishing African Arts/Arts d'Afrique as a bilingual magazine, serving both English-speaking and French-speaking Africa, must come to an end. It has been apparent for some time that too few of our readers are bilingual for this difficult and costly process of double language printing to be justified. Beginning with the summer issue, the magazine will be published only in, English, and will be known simply as African Arts. We shall continue to make every effort to reflect the arts of the French-speaking peoples of Africa, and translation may even allow the articles from these areas to be more widely read. Those who wish to may apply for a refund of the unexpired portion of their subscriptions. But we desperately need a large readership in this period when support for the arts in American universities is disastrously low, and we trust that most subscribers will continue to aid in our important work. nous regrettons vivement... que notre experience de publier African Arts/Arts d'Afrique en deux langues, pour servir Afrique anglophone et Afrique francophone doive se terminer. II est devenu evident que trop peu de nos lecteurs sont bilingues pour que ce proc6de de tirage difficile et coOteux en deux langues soit justifi6. D6s notre numero de 1'ete la revue ne sera publie qu'en anglais et portera le titre African Arts. Nous ferons touts les efforts pour continuer a reflechir les arts de I'Afrique francophone. Les articles traduits de frangais pourront ainsi avoir un public plus grand. Nous rembourserons la part non expiree des abonnements pour ceux qui le veulent.

The dance as performed by the Makonde is not directly associated with the rites. Although I witnessed this dance performed by Mozambique Ma- kondes on several occasions, I could dis- cover no special significance other than that it was performed for enjoyment. The masked figure emerging from the bush represented a very friendly spirit, and there was no similarity with other African dances in which an evil spirit is eventually overcome and banished again to the bush. Mrs. Shore-Bos' remarks about the fierceness and power of the Makonde are wide of the mark. To say that "as far north as Kenya, in the Congo and Ma- lawi, and throughout Tanzania, they are held in awe by other tribes" is pure fiction. They have migrated in great numbers to the Tanzanian side of the Rovuma and have always lived happily and peacefully with people of other tribes, like the Makua and the Yao. Cer- tainly the Makonde themselves would deny Mrs. Shore-Bos' statement that this reputation for ferocity was encouraged by the Makonde themselves. If they were bypassed by the slave-raiders this was not from any fear the Swahili slave- traders had of them, but because the very thick bush on the plateau discour- aged armed raiding. The tradition among the Tanzanian Makonde is that they came to the plateau for protection against tribal warfare on the plain, not because they sought a suitable base for making war. And as for the Mozambique participation in the present struggle, it seems clear that the forays made from the plateau on behalf of Frelimo are di- rected by non-Makondes. Amongst the officers of Frelimo whom I met in Dar es Salaam in 1968 not one was a Ma- konde. They were all Makuas, which is what I would expect. Mrs. Shore-Bos' description of Ma- konde art on p. 49 would not be recog- nized or understood by the sculptors, but I realize that she has a right to give her own interpretation. My criticisms are more germane to the historical de- velopment of Makonde sculpture. She is inaccurate about the historical impact of the missions on the development of Makonde sculpture. What is her evi- dence for stating that the missions frowned upon "the paganism and idol- atry" of this art? Or that "the carvings were destroyed; the values and beliefs were subject to attack, sometimes direct and fierce, sometimes subtle and more devious, undermining the artist's confi- dence in his vision of the world"... etc.? Mrs. Shore-Bos does not tell us Continued on page 68 7</page><page sequence="3">Continued from page 7 which values or beliefs relating to the sculpture were attacked by the missions. The truth is-and I can claim to know the truth about this since I was one of the few missionaries in the Rovuma Val- ley at a time when the sculptures were first appearing in Tanzania-that at the Catholic cathedrals in Ndanda and Pera- miho the Fathers encouraged this in- digenous art by commissioning works for what was meant to be an African cathedral. But there was never any "mass production for mass sale." The picture Mrs. Shore-Bos paints of mass production and commercialism due to the nefarious plans of the missionaries is quite false. The commercialism came much later and was encouraged not least by the acquisitive habits of young scholars from American universities. The Mozambique Makonde had gen- erally much more initiative than the Makonde of Tanzania. They travelled much more readily to places like Dar es Salaam, Tanga and even Nairobi, and it was there that they learned the com- mercial potentialities of their art. I know of no valuable collections of Makonde art in any of the churches of Southern Tanzania in spite of Mrs. Shore-Bos' statement to the contrary. The art has been commercialized in recent years be- cause of the intervention of entrepre- neurs. In this connection the entrepre- neurs have been able to influence the sculptors to introduce foreign motifs. My friend Mr. Geoffrey Heald, who has been engaged in leprosy work along the Rovuma for many years, told me re- cently that he has known at least two Indian businessmen who came expressly to sculptors in the Rovuma Valley to direct their work. The composite figures now so common in Makonde sculpture sold in Dar es Salaam have recognizable Indian influence. There were no such composite figures in the earlier work, though the sculptors knew how to repre- sent more than one figure out of a block of wood. The composite figures I mean are those intertwined figures which are so reminiscent of what one might see in an Indian temple. The Makonde sculptors copy from one another, hence the spread of this par- ticular style which, unless they know better, will be commented on by art critics as revealing what Mrs. Shore-Bos calls "surrealistic types reminiscent of the paintings of a grotesque and violent The Throwing Knives shown in our last issue (Volume III, Number 2) are all from the collections of the Museum of Ethnic Arts, University of California, Los Angeles. world" Mozambique Makonde carvings have traditionally been realistic and hu- manistic, but never, until their Indian friends came along for commercial pur- poses, grotesque and violent. Also, it would be difficult to identify today any style of Makonde sculpture which is at- tributable to what Mrs. Shore-Bos calls colonial influence. In colonial davs Ma- konde sculptors made figures of admin- istrative officers, but anyone who has seen one would agree that the adminis- trative officer represented could hardly be held responsible for what was an extension of the traditional art, a wav for the Makonde artist to get his own back and to satirize the administration. Makonde artists have not been influ- enced, as Mrs. Shore-Bos says, bv the art of the Upper Nile, the Cameroons, the Congo, Indonesia, Asia or the Middle East. With no evidence of any contact with these peoples, how could there have been anv such influence? The Mo- zambique Makonde are excellent sculp- tors, but I am sure your readers would agree that we should not spoil their con- tribution bv misrepresenting it to the world. Lyndon Harries Madison, Wisconsin Professor Harries remarks upon the in- fluence of Indian design on recent Ma- konde sculpture. This observation lends an extra interest to Mr. Peera's descrip- tion of the part he played in encourag- ing certain Makonde carvers during the early stages of their work. Mr. Peera's gallery on Independence Avenue in Dar es Salaam is well known to both visitors and collectors. He has been involved in this field for several years and his remarks add a further in- teresting dimension to our understand- ing of this area of the African arts. The tradition of wood carving has been with the Makonde people for a considerable period. Their skill in this area has long been passed from genera- tion to generation. Early known works included dance masks, stools and statu- ettes in traditional style. Towards the beginning of the twentieth century, trad- ers from Mozambique started commis- sioning particular types of Makonde pieces to be made in quantities. As the Makonde artists came north to take ad- vantage of these new-found opportuni- ties, their representational carvings reached the southern coast of Tanzania where they grew into a successful com- mercial enterprise. This development proved highly significant, as it encour- aged the carving skill among a wider segment of the tribe. Perhaps, we could not have written the story that follows, had the carvers remained only a hand- ful, busying themselves solely when there was a ceremony to serve. By a fluke of fate, the emergence of the modern Makonde art so prevalent today occurred in our enterprise in Dar es Salaam. Early in 1953, a man came to the shop and asked if there was a job he could have. I said there was none, but on second thought asked if he could do beadwork. He replied that he did not know beadwork, but could carve. I had not seen any of his tribesmen's carvings, and I told him so. However, he remained politely emphatic as to his skill. Conse- quently, though still unsure, I told him to come the next day. Upon his arrival, I gave him a small piece of wood from which he produced a bust in a couple of hours sitting in our yard. It was a small but clean piece of work. I was impressed and asked if he would carve for us were we to provide him with wood. He agreed, and promptly set to work. His early pieces were a man smoking a pipe and a woman kneeling with a baby, all representational pieces which he had been making in his village in Mozambique and later in the south of Tanzania. This skilled worker, Manguli Istiwawo, gave attention to detail and finish. We started giving him larger pieces of wood, and he met the challenge. Group figures of dancers and acrobats emerged. It was a happy association, and we were get- ting pieces that we had never seen be- fore. Apparently satisfied with our re- sponse to his work, after some six weeks, Istiwawo suggested bringing a friend of his, who was also a sculptor, to the shop. Swaya came the following day, and proved to be a fine artist. After a few days, he in turn introduced us to his friend, Jawawila. Soon word began to spread among members of the tribe who worked as farm labourers and watchmen around Dar es Salaam, that "Peela" (the "r" becomes an "1" with the Makonde) pro- vided wood and bought everything the artist produced. In a few months we had eighteen artists with us, each of whom secured his place by carving the by now standard figure of the smoker. The different artists brought their indi- vidual talents, and we began to discern their work. Pieces with movement and life were more interesting and were fa- voured. However, the artists were com- pletely free to carve whatever they chose. We believe that this freedom brought out the latent urge of the artist to ex- press himself. Dancers, fighters, hunting scenes, woodcutters, women doing house- hold chores - all these emerged. We con- tinued building up a large assortment, and found that artists from Mtwara in southern Tanzania were coming to work with us. Many a time we would find new faces in the carving yard. Manguli as- sured us that they were apprentices, and though a bit skeptical, we allowed them 68</page><page sequence="4">to work. Today, some of those same ap- prentices are master sculptors. One of the artists, Samaki, came from Moeda in northern Mozambique, having worked for some time in Mtwara before moving to Dar es Salaam. He brought a few pieces of his work to show us. There was a certain stiffness, but this was usual in the beginning stages. How- ever, his work continued to be disap- pointingly stiff and expressionless, and this was indeed unusual. All attempts to bring a sense of freedom into his work failed. Eventually, it became necessary to tell him that if he were not able to do better, I could not continue to buy his work, and suggested that perhaps it would be better for him to leave work- ing as a sculptor. I had hit at Samaki's pride. He was a strong personality and respected among his friends. A couple of weeks later, he came with his usual work, but among them was a very inter- esting and unusual piece. The head was a round ball with two holes for eyes and a hole for a mouth. The body was bulbous with two thin legs on a round base. Several weeks later, when I spoke of the piece to him, Samaki maintained that he had not made the piece and had no knowledge of it. He was apparently trying to guage my eagerness. Presently satisfied, he asked if I meant the "She- tani" figure. This was a new name to me, and I asked him to carve more ex- amples. His personality now started to emerge, and he worked faster and more freely. In a week he had brought four pieces, and each was an exciting study in form. On the shelves of the shop, Ja- wawila noticed these pieces, and asked if I bought Shetani pieces. I told him of my interest and shortly thereafter he brought in a gruesome figure with one eye, one large ear, half a face, with the other half all scales of a snake, one arm, and one leg, carrying a calabash. This was Yoka, a figure of Makonde folklore, half snake and half human. This led to an exciting development, as other artists started to make their own versions. The age of the spirit sculpture had now commenced. Many of the art- ists revelled in the new-found freedom the spirit sculptures gave them. The technique was less severe, and some art- ists were making a piece a day, where a representational piece took three or four days. New concepts were constantly experimented with. Pieces utilising the effect of the bark and the black of ebony (mpingo) started in these days, as did the pillar structure. Faulty wood was no longer thrown away. It challenged the artists' imagination, and we received some fascinating pieces. Our apprentices began to create the spirit figures with new gusto. The discipline of the life- figures was strict; the spirit concept could have tremendous power even 17th-I8th Century ' 00 ;; Height 16 in. Pr;iie andsn AMdernuart Meo Spso c.

Love, tenderness, the excitement of aroused passions found their way subtly into the pieces. Very slowly but markedly we began to notice that the artist was using the abstractness of the spirit medium to ex- press his thoughts and feelings, or com- ment on his personal experiences. One of the earliest pieces I remember in this genre was a mutilated face of a spirit holding a telephone. I remarked to the artist that a Makonde figure with a tele- phone did not look right. The artist said he would not make such pieces again, but was clearly very angry. He told me of the telephone linesmen who sat op- posite his hut, continuously ringing the telephone the whole day in order to im- press the artist's wife. This was the cause of his anger. We also began to notice how an art- ist's change of mood, or upsets in his personal life deeply affected his creativ- ity. Sculpting had become a labour of love and part of his being. We found that the wood also deter- mined an artist's response, and we had instances where the artist had to get his own logs to be able to convey concepts to his satisfaction. One artist spent sev- eral months in the ebony forest picking out fossilized ebony branches with mul- tiple spikes to use in expressing his mes- sage. Individuality in the stream of art was important, and we encouraged it. The master carver and those who had a strong personality developed and per- fected their own styles. The artists never had any formal training other than the direct instructions from the master; and they did not need any. It was incredible to watch an apprentice who had been a clove-picker within a few weeks come up with excitingly individual work and go on to become an important artist. As the artists worked, some would develop a theme, continue with it for many months, and having exhausted it, move on. Today, the Makonde artists carry on their fascinating work. From a very small beginning, their art has now entered the world stage. International exposure will demand greater effort to bring out only the finest work, which must compete with the creations of some of the world's best artists. The golden age of Makonde art has just begun. I am confident that those artists who have created monu- mental works and are enjoying the lib- erty of constant experimentation as they evolve new concepts and reach new heights, will continue to bring to the art world joy and fascination for a long time to come. Mohammed Peera Dar es Salaam The following comments by the distin- guished South African artist and critic, Walter Battiss, offer one further inter- pretation of this intriguing and contro- versial art. Makonde sculpture has within recent years developed into one of Africa's most surprising new arts. It has an un- usual combination of zoomorphic and anthropomorphic forms, based not only on folklore and religious myths but on the creative imagination of highly indi- vidual and uninhibited artists. The African art of the past that at- tracted Picasso, Braque, Matisse and Pechstein gave 20th century art a primi- tive twist that still persists in certain areas. Recently I sent photographs of Makonde sculpture through Daniel Henri-Kahnweiler to Picasso who showed a lively interest in the new shapes. It is obvious that the new aes- thetic of the 20th century has led to a deeper understanding and appreciation of African art. The old aesthetic based on classical Greek and Roman art could hardly be used to measure or evaluate the very unusual qualities of African art so often described by puzzled anthro- pologists (rather than art critics) as bar- baric, crude, distorted and erotic. q?;, ^^fd^ ' We're new!

The value of African art is its abso- lute honesty in revealing even in excess the physical aspects of men, animals and mythical creatures. These elongations and distortions of limbs, breasts and genitals house the ancestral spirits of the tribes and the powers that animate them. Sex, unlike that in European Christian art, has no shame but is a manifestation of power. The Makonde usually prefer to live in small groups away from other tribes and have acquired an undeserved reputa- tion for fierceness and unfriendliness. Their isolation on the remote Makonde Plateau has protected their art from foreign influences longer than anywhere else along the East African coast. In such rare isolation little is known of their reputed secret societies. How much now remains of traditional sculpture used in puberty rites is difficult to tell, for today the Makonde Plateau is an area disturbed by Frelimo guerrillas. Art is a very important part of Ma- konde culture, and many artists in the vicinity of Dar-es-Salaam have been tempted to carve for the tourist market. Fortunately some of these artists take absolutely no notice of traditional art or tourist demands and strike out along their own original lines. Others produce surprising new forms of art stemming from very personal uninhibited interpre- tations of traditional forms, such as the enormous ears, the rabbit teeth, the physical malformations they have ob- served for themselves. Makonde sculptors do not sign their works. Styles and subjects separate the best from a great deal of anonymous art. For instance, the fish seldom appears in Makonde sculpture, but there is a carv- ing of a fish-spirit 28 inches high by Samaki, one of the greatest of Makonde sculptors, whose name in Swahili means fish. The serpent-spirit is an important Makonde subject, often shown in unison with women. From it have come the abstract curves and coils of much Ma- konde sculpture. Carvings representing the magician or sorcerer are common. An important aspect of Makonde sculpture is its lack of monotonous repe- tition. New subject matter is constantly being absorbed. Personal styles make for great variations in the technique. One is constantly surprised by the dar- ing of the sculptor, for this absolute confidence in his talent produces works of unusual rhythm and beauty. A few years ago I discovered three remarkable carvings in the Ivy Collec- tion in Pretoria. I was told they came from Makondeland and the name on a label said "Samaki' These works were so astonishingly different from the Ma- konde carvings for the tourist trade that I had seen before that I took every op- 70 II</page><page sequence="6">portunity to come in to look at them. Ultimately I came to possess them, and to show them to other artists who had never seen Makonde art of such remark- able vitality before. For all of us it was an important new discovery. Walter Battiss University of South Africa Observations sur Mbundu On ne peut que feliciter Marie-Louise Bastin pour son remarquable article sur l'art des Ovimbundu (Mbundu) Vol. II, No. 4). La grande specialiste de l'art Chokwe etait certainement la plus qua- lifiee pour une telle etude. Nous ne vou- lons pas revenir ici sur ses remarques stylistiques, interessantes et fort judi- cieuses; nous aimerions seulement reve- nir sur l'interpretation des statuettes comparees ici 'a Inakulu et Nana ya- kama. Au cours de ces demieres annees nous avons particulierement etudie les nombreuses questions liees a la royaute en Angola; aussi ce probleme ne manque pas de nous interesser. D'autre part nous avons visite a plusieurs reprises, mais toutefois apres le passage de Verly, la grande et belle residence royale de Ekumba. de la tribu des Chiaka d'olu proviennent certaines des statuettes presentees. Bien que nous ayons deja visite des dizaines de chefferies et villages royaux parmi les Ovimbundu et les ethnies voisines, nous n'avons que fort rarement rencontre des statuettes de representa- tions humaines et jamais semblables a celles que presente Marie-Louise Bastin; c'est pourquoi ces exemplaires nous sem- blent d'autant plus interessants. Pour pouvoir donner une explication certaine de ces figurines il serait evidemment necessaire de connaitre exactement l'en- droit, peut-etre la hutte, ou elles ont ete trouvees; il faudrait aussi recevoir de la part des dignitaires du village, une ex- plication circonstanciee, ce que n'etait pas chose facile pour Verly qui ne con- naissait pas la langue, et dependait de traducteurs et d'interpretes. Bastin fait allusion au coffre ochihuti qui, si nous comprenons bien, contenait les batons sacres, mais pas les sculptures. Personnellement, nous avouons avoir de la peine 'a voir dans ces statuettes, representations feminines, les deux fem- mes ci-dessus mentionnees. La remarque que ces "statuettes portent les traces oranges et luisantes des onctions 'a l'huile de palme periodiquement faites" (p. 34) les place dans le domaine culturel. Voici brievement ce qui nous semble etre une explication possible du sens de ces figu- rines.
