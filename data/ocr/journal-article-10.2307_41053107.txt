It is structured around four themes: language, intelligence, symbolism, and social learning. It includes reference to recent work in other disciplines that is either having, or likely to have, considerable impact on archaeological thought. The evolution of mind is a highly contentious subject, plagued by problems of definition and lacking an explicit methodology. This paper argues that the two most positive trends of recent work have been greater attempts at interdisciplinary studies and the integration of the study of cognition with that of hominid lifestyles. KEY WORDS: Palaeolithic archaeology; evolution; language; intelligence; social learning; sym- bolism; the Mind. INTRODUCTION During the last five years the study of the human mind has regained respectability as a science. In comparison with the 1960s and 1970s, there has been a veritable flood of books concerning the mind, particularly with regard to the evolution of language and consciousness (e.g., Calvin, 1990; Corballis, 1992a; Dennett, 1992; Donald, 1991; Humphrey, 1984, 1992; Jackendoff, 1987; Penrose, 1989; Searle, 1992). While archaeologists have not neglected the mental characteristics of early hominids (e.g., Gowlett, 1984; Isaac, 1986; Wynn, 1979, 1981), this renewed concern with the evo- lution of mind has also been reflected in archaeology. Similarly, in closely related disciplines there has been substantial development of research re- 1 Department of Archaeology, University of Reading, Whiteknights, P.O.

Studies of cognitive pathologies, such as aphasia and apraxia, are also making a substantial contribution to our un- derstanding of the evolution of mind (e.g., Donald, 1991; Kempler, 1993), while a subdiscipline of 'evolutionary psychology' has recently emerged (e.g., Barkow et al, 1992). This paper reviews recent archaeological work concerning four issues: the evolution of language, intelligence, visual symbolism, and social learn- ing. It is inevitable that some reference must also be made to studies in psychology, biological anthropology and primatology since the study of mind demands an interdisciplinary approach. But the focus of this paper is with the drawing of inferences about the evolution of mind from the material residues of past behavior rather than from hominid fossils, living primates, or the modern mind. THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE Most people acknowledge that language is a uniquely human capacity; indeed it has been suggested that there can be neither culture nor mind without language (Davidson and Noble, 1989, 1993) The extent to which we attribute linguistic capacities to apes and other nonhuman species de- pends, of course, on how we define language- about which there has been limited agreement (e.g., Ingold, 1993a). But in spite of several decades of language experiments (Parker and Gibson, 1990; Savage-Rumbaugh, 1986), no ape has acquired the two features that characterize human language: a vast lexicon of many thousands of words and a series of complex gram- matical rules. The capacity for language is also widely acknowledged as having a genetic basis, and linguistic behavior is most appropriately char- acterized as an instinct, an ability that is developed rather than learned (Pinker, 1994; Pinker and Bloom, 1990). Noam Chomsky recognized that all languages share the same structure, which he termed the "universal grammar" (e.g., Chomsky, 1972). As a uniquely human capacity, but one that is part of our biological constitution, the capacity for language must have arisen after the phylogenetic divergence of hominids from the apes, between 8 and 5 million years ago. It is likely, therefore, that the evolution of the capacity for language occurred during the time frame of the archae- ological record.</page><page sequence="3">Palaeolithic Archaeology and the Evolution of Mind 307 The challenge facing archaeologists is to develop criteria for how a linguistic capacity can be recognized in a Palaeolithic archaeological record dominated by stone tools and the waste from their manufacture. The fea- sibility of directly inferring language from technology is likely to depend upon the relationship of language to other cognitive processes. If the same cognitive processes are used in generating utterances as in generating stone tools, as has been argued by Holloway (1969, 1981), then as technology reaches a complexity equivalent to that of modern humans we can safely assume that language does likewise. On this basis, language would be im- plied by the appearance of later Acheulian technology, which involved long and complex knapping sequences (Gowlett, 1984). Similarly, the presence of a series of discrete artifact types might be thought to imply linguistic categories (Dibble, 1989). If, on the other hand, language and technology rely on independent cognitive processes, any direct inference about linguistic capacity from tech- nology will be impossible. In light of arguments in psycholingusitics, such as by Chomsky (1972) and Fodor (1983), this appears to be the case: lan- guage derives from highly modularized cognitive processes, which are spe- cific to language alone. It has been noted that people who have lost their capacity for language due to cognitive pathologies, often remain unim- paired with regard to their capacity for fine motor control (Donald, 1991). However, the presence of a linguistic capacity ought to be evident from indirect evidence in the archaeological record. Modern behavior is so fun- damentally structured by language that its appearance ought to be marked by a new set of behaviors evident as much in the spatial patterning of ar- tifacts, at scales ranging from within-site to global distributions, as in the nature of those artifacts themselves. This has led several archaeologists to argue that fully modern language is a very late evolutionary event, appearing at ca. 6O-40 kyr and funda- mentally related to the transition from the Middle to the Upper Palaeolithic (e.g., Davidson, 1991; Davidson and Noble, 1989; Mellars, 1991; Whallon, 1989). Davidson and Noble (1989; Davidson, 1991), stressing the symbolic aspect of language, have argued that its origin lies in iconic gesture, for this allowed people to recognize that an arbitrary symbol can be used to refer to a distant event. They suggest that the colonization of Australia (ca. 60-50 kyr), requiring the manufacture of boats and crossing of exten- sive waters, is the earliest indirect evidence for a linguistic capacity (David- son and Noble, 1992). In a similar vein, Whallon (1989) has suggested that fully modern language was critical for the colonization of arid environ- ments, such as Siberia at ca. 50 kyr, for it was only with language that the extensive social alliance networks, essential for survival in such marginal environments, could have been maintained.</page><page sequence="4">308 Mithen At a smaller spatial scale, the absence of intrasite spatial patterning of artifacts and features that imply "conversation groups" on pre-Upper Palaeolithic sites, such as discrete scatters of knapping and butchery debris clustered around a hearth, may indeed suggest that the degree of conver- sation was markedly limited prior to 60-40,000 bp. This has been stressed by Gamble (Stringer and Gamble, 1993), who contrasts the type of pat- terning found on undisturbed activity surfaces at early Palaeolithic sites such as Boxgrove and Mastricht Belvédère and those at Upper Palaeolithic sites such as Pincevent and Etiolles. At the latter one can readily recon- struct activities focused around a hearth in spatial patterns that suggest intense social interaction mediated by conversation. At the early Palaeo- lithic sites, however, activities appear to be spatially distributed with little regard for each other implying that conversation between individuals was limited, if not absent. It might be argued that rather than not having any- thing to say, early Palaeolithic hominids lacked the capacity to say it. If these arguments for a late evolution of language are correct, they raise the issue of the nature of language prior to ca. 50 kyr. We must expect this to have been substantially more developed than the vocalizations of mod- ern apes, partly in light of the behavioral achievements of these hominids, such as colonization of northern latitudes and partly because language must have an evolutionary history. Moreover, when the endocasts of hominids are examined, we find a development of those areas that are thought to be related to language stretching as far back as H.habilis (e.g., Calvin, 1983; Falk, 1980; Holloway and de la Coste-Lareymondie, 1982; Tobias, 1987, 1991). One possibility for the nature of "proto-language" is that it was prin- cipally gestural in nature (Corballis, 1992a, 1992b). Indeed, it has long been argued that the origins of language lies in gesture, and it is clear from modern sign languages, that speech is merely one particular manifestation of the linguistic capacity (Donald, 1991; Goldwin-Meadow, 1993; Kendon, 1993). As such, proto-language may have involved all the elements of spo- ken language but, simply, have been gestural rather than spoken. There has been a considerable amount of recent literature devoted to this issue (e.g., Armstrong et al., 1994; Burling, 1993; Milo and Quiatt, 1993), al- though the archaeological implications remain largely unexplored. Corballis (1992b) argues that at the transition to the Upper Palaeolithic, there is a change in mode of language from gesture to speech, thus freeing the hands for the technical and artistic developments that occur during the Upper Palaeolithic. While this idea appears to be unfairly dismissive of the tech- nological achievements of the Middle Palaeolithic, Lieberman (1991, 1992) has argued that Neanderthals could only produce a very restrictive range of vocal sounds due to the relative positions of the larynx and windpipe. Human speech is dependent upon an angled vocal tract with a larynx de-</page><page sequence="5">Palaeolithic Archaeology and the Evolution of Mind 309 scended into the neck, which appears to be unique to Homo sapiens sapiens. The discovery of a Neanderthal hyoid bone (Arensburg et al., 1989) has been used to argue, contra Lieberman, that there are no limits on Nean- derthal speech (Arensburg et ai, 1990; Bar-Yosef et ai, 1992), a view still challenged by Lieberman (1993). Even if Lieberman is correct, it is unlikely that extensive vocalization did not play a substantial role in the proto-language of archaic humans. It is clear that the vocalizations of monkeys and apes are intentional and es- sential to their social interactions with conspecifics (e.g., Cheney and Sey- farth, 1990). In this regard there has been an alternative body of thought to those arguing that human spoken language is a recent and sudden de- velopment (e.g., Burling, 1993; Foley, 1991; Parker and Gibson, 1979; Savagh-Rumbaugh and Rumbaugh, 1993; Wynn, 1991). This views language as having evolved gradually during the Pleistocene, with its roots stretching much further back in time than the Middle/Upper Palaeolithic transition, and showing significant continuities with the vocalizations of nonhuman pri- mates. Indeed, although no ape can be said to possess language, recent experiments have claimed continuities between ape vocalizations and hu- man language, such as innate grammatical skills (e.g., Greenfield and Sav- age-Rumbaugh, 1990; Savagh-Rumbaugh and Rumbaugh, 1993). The most impressive work in this regard has been in biological anthro- pology by Dunbar (1993; Aiello and Dunbar, 1993), who explored the re- lationships between brain size (as measured by the size of the neocortex), group size, and the mechanisms used to maintain group cohesion. Dunbar (1992) demonstrated a significant relationship between neocortex size and group size among extant primates, which can be used to predict the mean group size for extinct hominids by using their estimated neocortex size from fossil endocasts. For modern humans a mean group size of 148 is predicted, for which support is claimed in a range of ethnographic and sociological data. Dunbar (1991) has also shown that among primates there is a signifi- cant relationship between group size and social grooming, which he argues is a means of maintaining group cohesion. From these relationships Aiello and Dunbar were able to predict that modern and archaic humans (including Neanderthals) would have had to have spent at least 30-45% of their daily time budgets in grooming to maintain their large groups, which they argue is unfeasible (20% is the maximum observed among living primates). Con- sequently, they argue that enhanced verbal communication evolved to act as an additional/alternative means of social bonding to maintain group co- hesion. In support of this argument, Dunbar (1993) has noted that so much of our modern communication is "gossip"- talk about the social relations of others, and suggests that this is a natural consequence of the evolutionary roots of language as a means to facilitate living in large groups.</page><page sequence="6">310 Mithen This evolutionary model suggests that by ca. 250 kyr years ago hominid group size had become so large that language with a significant social con- tent would have been essential. Moreover, the symbolic element of lan- guage is seen as evolving gradually as a means to increase the efficiency of language. As a model it has many advantages over the notion that lan- guage appeared suddenly at the Middle/Upper Palaeolithic transition, no- tably the embedding of language into an evolutionary ecological context, the identification of specific selective pressures, and its compatibility with recent work in related fields [e.g., linguistics (Pinker and Bloom, 1990)]. But it remains highly speculative, especially with regard to hominid group size during the Middle Pleistocene. THE EVOLUTION OF INTELLIGENCE The notion of intelligence is as difficult to define as language, or in- deed the mind itself (Ingold, 1993a; Parker and Baars, 1990). This review must start with the work of Thomas Wynn, who attempted to infer the evolution of intelligence from the morphology of stone artifacts by adopting the Piagetian scheme of mental development and the notion that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny (Wynn, 1979, 1981). While this work is relatively well discussed in Palaeolithic studies (e.g., Duff et al, 1992), it requires réévaluation due to changing notions of intelligence. The Piagetian view of fully developed/evolved intelligence is that it is constituted by a small set of general purpose learning mechanisms. This view has been challenged in the cognitive sciences during the last decade by a shift to a "domain specific" view of intelligence and a modular view of the mind (e.g., Cos- mides and Tooby, 1987; Fodor, 1983; Gardner, 1983; Hirschfeld and Gel- man, 1994; Tooby and Cosmides, 1989). This in turn has been reflected in the later work of Wynn (1993) and recent interpretations of the Palaeolithic record by Robson-Brown (1993) and Mithen (1994a) and is likely to have a large impact on the development of cognitive archaeology. Thomas Wynn and Piagetian Structuralism During the later 1970s and early 1980s Thomas Wynn introduced the use of the Piagetian scheme of mental development into archaeology, adopting an explicit position that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny (Wynn, 1979, 1981). Piaget's scheme proposed a sequence of mental stages begin- ning with the "innate" reflex actions of the newborn and ending with the hypothetical reasoning of the adult. In its simplest form, Piaget proposed</page><page sequence="7">Palaeolithic Archaeology and the Evolution of Mind 311 four sequential periods of intellectual development between infancy and adolescence: sensorimotor intelligence (birth-2years), preoperational intel- ligence (2-6/7 years), operational intelligence (6/7-11/12 years), and formal operational intelligence after the age of 12. Each of these were divided into a number of stages and complicated by the introduction of concepts such as décalage to account for the time lags in the attainment of particular cognitive levels in different domains. This model was constructed to de- scribe the cognitive development of the child. The extent to which it is also appropriate for describing and comparing the mature cognitive abilities of living nonhuman primates and extinct hominids, i.e., whether ontogeny re- capitulates phylogeny, is a matter of considerable controversy (e.g., Gibson, 1990; Gould, 1977; Lock, 1993; Parker and Gibson, 1979). Wynn argued that each Piagetian stage involved the development of a specific set of spatial concepts and explored the evidence for these in Palaeolithic technology. Oldowan tools, he argued, only required the very limited spatial concepts found in preoperational intelligence, while the ad- vanced spatial concepts of operational intelligence were necessary to manu- facture late Acheulian bifaces (Wynn, 1979, 1981). As such, Wynn proposed a scenario for the evolution of human intelligence. Wynn's work has been widely praised for not only bringing the issue of cognition into the archaeological literature but for providing a coherent methodology for inferring cognitive capacities from stone artifacts and link- ing archaeology to the cognitive sciences (e.g., Duff et al, 1992). Yet its value hinges on whether we accept the Piagetian scheme as an appropriate framework for hominid cognitive evolution. The recapitulist position has always been open to criticism, but the problems have become more pertinent as cognitive archaeology and cog- nitive ethology have become more open to critical discussion (e.g., An- tinucci, 1990; Fragaszy, 1990). Perhaps the most significant weakness is the anthropocentric bias when this developmental framework, derived from a study of modern humans, is used to measure the intelligence of other spe- cies. This often results in other species not only appearing different, but also inferior to modern humans. Their minds appear as watered down ver- sions of the human mind, somehow anticipating its evolution by their ex- istence. A related problem is that the Piagetian approach characterizes cognitive development as a gradual progression to that of the mature in- dividual. Yet the mind of the developing organism is never simply an un- derdeveloped version of the adult, but one that suits the immature organism for its specific way of life. Similarly, the minds of early hominids ought to be regarded as adaptations for their particular lifestyle. This re- lates to a further, and perhaps the most critical, weakness of a Piagetian approach in archaeology: there is no connection between a Piagetian de-</page><page sequence="8">312 Mithen scription/analysis of a species cognition and the adaptive challenges that have shaped, and continue to shape, that animal's thought and behavior. The Piagetian approach fails to provide an adequate framework why dif- ferent species should reach different levels of cognitive development, or to be more advanced in some aspects of cognition rather than others. These problems with the Piagetian approach, becoming more apparent as cognitive archaeology develops, must mold our views of Wynn's work. Inferring that Oldwan hominids had preoperational intelligence in contrast to the operational intelligence of H. erectus is ultimately of little conse- quence for understanding the archaeological record and the course of cog- nitive evolution. The implications of such levels of intelligence for aspects of behavior such as foraging and social interaction have not been- and probably cannot be- defined. Consequently, as cognitive archaeology de- velops the utility of a Piagetian approach appears less evident, although one must acknowledge the major contribution Wynn's work has made to Palaeolithic studies and the emergence of a cognitive archaeology. As we will see below, Wynn himself has moved to a less ambitious, but more re- warding, position by focusing on specific cognitive traits, rather than the intellect as a whole. Mental Modularity and Domain-Specific Intelligence A modular view of the mind and the notion of domain-specific intel- ligence has become increasingly prevalent in the cognitive sciences during the last decade. This has been most thoroughly explored in the recent vol- ume edited by Hirschfeld and Gelman (1994). It largely originates in the work of Chomsky (1972) and Fodor (1983), who characterized the language capacity as a suite of discrete psychological processes, separate ("encapsu- lated") from other "modules" such as vision. Fodor (1983) argued that mental modularity applied to perception alone (within which he included language). Cognition, which he felt could be vaguely defined only as "thought" or "problem solving," was characterized by a small set of general purpose psychological processes claimed to be unamenable to scientific ex- amination. In contrast, Gardner (1983) disregarded any distinction between cognition and perception and suggested that the mind should be viewed as a set of "multiple intelligences." He proposed six domains of intelligence, each ultimately based on their own neural circuits: linguistic, musical, per- sonal, logical-mathematical, spatial, and bodily-kinesthetic. Advanced ca- pacities in any ooe of these domains would not necessarily imply similar abilities in any other domain.</page><page sequence="9">Palaeolithic Archaeology and the Evolution of Mind 313 A different perspective on domain-specific intelligence has arisen in the study of nonhuman primates and human evolution. Here a distinction has been drawn between "social" and "nonsocial" intelligence. This derives largely from the seminal 1976 paper by Humphrey on the "social function of intellect" and has been developed by characterizing social intelligence of primates as Machiavellian in character (Byrne and Whiten, 1988). Social intelligence refers to abilities at "mind reading," deception, and alliance formation. As such, this has been contrasted with nonsocial intelligence- interaction with the physical world and members of other animal species. Vervet monkeys appear to have far greater cognitive abilities in the social rather than nonsocial domains (Cheney and Seyfarth, 1990). For instance they appear to be able to rank members of their group according to status, but unable to rank the amount of water in a series of containers, even though the task appears equivalent. A more extreme modular view of the mind has been proposed by Cos- mides and Tooby (1987; Tooby and Cosmides, 1989). Rather than dealing with domains of thought and behavior, they argue that the mind is com- posed of a multitude of highly specialized psychological processes that they term "Darwinian algorithms." They argue that these algorithms evolved during the Pleistocene in response to the selective pressures faced by Pa- laeolithic hunter-gatherers. For instance, they argue that there are specific algorithms for "cheeter detection" in social transaction, as this would have been critical in social processes such food sharing and alliance formation (Cosmides, 1989). They embed this approach to the mind in evolutionary theory, arguing that a highly modular and domain-specific intellect, rather than a generalized intelligence, is the most likely consequence of the known processes of biological evolution, specifically natural selection. As yet there has been limited application of this domain-specific per- spective on the mind, but its significance can be seen in the work of Thomas Wynn. In his earlier work (as discussed above), he was prepared to consider the evolution of intelligence as a single monolithic entity. But in his most recent work (Wynn, 1989, 1993) he adopts a more modest- but more re- warding-approach, focusing on more narrowly defined abilities, notably spatial thought. Consequently, while he uses stone tools to contrast the spatial cognition of H. habilis and H. erectus, he hesitates at drawing infer- ences about other cognitive domains. Robson-Brown (1993) has also focused on spatial intelligence as in- ferred from stone tools and explicitly adopted a modular perspective. She identified a series of specific cognitive processes involved in spatial intel- ligence, such as mental rotation, element recognition, and visual attention, and explored whether these could be inferred in lithic artifacts from Zhouk- oudian. These were choppers and scrapers, lacking the symmetry of bifaces</page><page sequence="10">314 Mithen upon which Wynn's Piagetian approaches relied. Robson-Brown claimed that a constellation of cognitive traits relating to spatial intelligence can nevertheless be inferred from these artifacts, defining a form of spatial in- telligence for Asian H. erectus that contrasts with that of modern apes and modern humans. I have proposed a more ambitious use of the domain-specific view of intelligence by suggesting that this holds the key to understanding the Mid- dle/Upper Palaeolithic transition (Mithen, 1994a). This drew on the work of Rozin (1976; Rozin and Schull, 1988), who suggested that the course of hominid cognitive evolution involved a trend away from a domain-specific to a more generalized form of intelligence, in which cognitive processes that had evolved for specific tasks within specific domains (Darwinian al- gorithms in Cosmides and Tooby's terminology) are now shared across do- mains. I suggested that this transition from a domain-specific to a generalized intelligence may indeed underlie the behavioral changes that mark the start of the Upper Palaeolithic. The Lower and Middle Palaeo- lithic records suggest that by 40 kya essentially modern forms of intelligence had evolved in the domains of technology, social interaction, and natural history (Mithen, 1994b). For instance, Acheulian or Levallois technology appears to involve as complex a series of cognitive processes as that of the Upper Palaeolithic. This has become particularly apparent from the refit- ting of cores from Middle Palaeolithic sites, demonstrating the under- standing of fracture mechanics and the use of planned sequences of removals by premodern hominids (e.g., at Mastricht Belvédère, Roebroeks, 1988). Moreover, there are numerous cases of "Upper Palaeolithic" blade industries firmly embedded within Middle Palaeolithic sequences (Ronen, 1992). Similarly, to have survived in northern glaciated landscapes early humans must have utilized an advanced "natural history" intelligence in terms of "reading" the environment for signs of prey and predators and understanding the annual changes in their natural world. With regard to social intelligence, this is also likely to be equivalent to that of modern humans in light of its apparent early evolution in the hominoid line (Byrne and Whiten, 1992). From this basis, I have argued that the cognitive changes at the tran- sition mark a substantial increase in the "accessibility" between domains and that this can account for many of the behavioral changes at that time. The clearest example is the use of social intelligence to "think" about the nonsocial world, manifest in anthropomorphism as seen is some of the ear- liest Palaeolithic art [e.g., the mammoth ivory man/lion figure from Ho- hlenstein-Stadel (Marshack, 1990)]. This attribution of human mental states to nonhuman animals is ubiquitous among modern hunter-gatherers and plays a major role in their effectiveness as foragers (Mithen, 1990, pp. 76-</page><page sequence="11">Palaeolithic Archaeology and the Evolution of Mind 315 77). Similarly, there is no clear separation between tool and social behav- ior/thought among modern (but preindustrialized) humans (Ingold, 1993b; Reynolds, 1993). The issue of domain-specific intelligence remains highly controversial with many terms and notions ill defined. Yet its appears to be making a major contribution in our understanding of human minds (Barkow et al., 1992; Hirschfeld and Gelman, 1994) and those of nonhuman primates (e.g., Byrne and Whiten, 1988; Cheney and Seyfarth, 1990). Similarly, the modu- lar perspectives on the early human mind remain contentious but offer a fresh approach to the evolution of the mind and are seeking an effective interaction between archaeology and the cognitive sciences. Perhaps the most promising future application of a domain-specific approach will con- cern the earliest modern humans in the Levant. The Qafzeh and Skhúl hominids, dating to ca, 100 kyr (Grün and Stringer, 1991), are associated with a Mousterian technology that appears to be essentially the same as that of the Neanderthals from Tabún and Kebara (Bar-Yosef, 1989). Yet it is evident from contrasts in the postcranial skeleton (Aiello, 1993; Trinkaus, 1992) that the behavior of the modern humans and Neanderthals differed, although it remains unclear in what precise ways. This has also become evident from the analysis of wear patterns on projectile points and the sea- sonality of large game kills (Lieberman and Shea, 1994). Such behavioral differences may have been unreflected in the production of stone tools due to a relatively high degree of domain-specific thought, resulting in a poor correlation between technological and other forms of behavior. THE EVOLUTION OF VISUAL SYMBOLISM The ability to create, manipulate, and interpret visual symbols is a uni- versal feature of the human mind, and one that is often invoked when we wish to distinguish ourselves from other primates. Humans create art, apes do not, although they can be taught, or encouraged, to use symbols (Sav- age-Rumbaugh and Rumbaugh, 1993). Theoretically, an archaeological study of the evolution of visual symbolism ought to be less contentious than one of intelligence or language, for the presence of this capacity should be directly reflected in the archaeological record in the form of artifacts that are either shaped or marked to carry symbolic meanings. Yet during the last decade there has been as much disagreement about the evolution of visual symbolism as about other facets of the mind. A widespread view on the evolution of visual symbolism is that this is a feature of the Middle/Upper Palaeolithic transition (Mellars, 1973, 1989a; White, 1982). Indeed, it is partly in light of the appearance of the first art</page><page sequence="12">316 Mithen after 50 kya that the transition is thought to reflect a cognitive transition (Mellars, 1991). In 1987 Chase and Dibble reviewed the evidence for Mid- dle Palaeolithic symbolism, concluding that there were no artifacts that could not be explained by reference to either utilitarian factors or as un- intended by products of activities such as cutting plants or meat. As such, there is no unequivocal evidence for Middle Palaeolithic symbolism, al- though symbolic capacity may have been present but simply not expressed. Following this, further examples of possible symbolic artifacts have been published, notably "deliberate engravings" by H. erectus on bone from Bilz- ingsleben (Mania and Mania, 1988), and catalogues of these have been drawn together by Marshack (1990) and Bednarik (1992). There remains an absence of any iconic (representational) images, and the strongest can- didates for evidence of Middle Palaeolithic symbolism are those objects that may have been pierced. Yet their status as Middle Palaeolithic symbolic artifacts can be challenged on numerous grounds (Davidson, 1990, 1992; Chase and Dibble, 1992), and the most persuasive position remains that put forward by Chase and Dibble (1987). The evidence against the expression of a capacity for visual symbolism, and by implication the capacity itself, during the Middle Palaeolithic has been supported by noting the contrasts in the use of space with that found during the Upper Palaeolithic (Stringer and Gamble, 1993). Among behav- iorally modern humans space is often used in a symbolically meaningful manner. The lack of site structure during the Middle Palaeolithic, such as the rarity of features in clear spatial patterns, suggests that a symbolic use of space may have been absent during the Middle Palaeolithic. While the conventional position on the appearance of visual symbol- ism has not been overturned by the discovery of an unquestionable piece of pre-Upper Palaeolithic art (e.g., a figurine in a sealed, undisturbed Mid- dle Palaeolithic context), there have been several publications that have clarified the problems in the recognition of early symbolic behavior- and explored the possible biases against its recognition. Chase (1991) drew a very clear distinction between the imposition of style and of intentional symbolic meaning on artifacts, although he recognized that these may have the same manifest appearance in the archaeological record. Lindley and Clark (1990), arguing for a gradual evolution of a capacity for symbolism during the Palaeolithic, pointed to a pervasive bias in archaeological in- terpretation acting against finding evidence for early Palaeolithic symbol- ism. They emphasized the rarity of symbolic artifacts being directly associated with early modern humans, and see a rapid development of symbolic behavior only at 20 kya, relating to environmental rather than cognitive change. After 50 kya symbolic artifacts remain rarç, even totally absent, in the archaeological records from large parts of the world, notably</page><page sequence="13">Palaeolithic Archaeology and the Evolution of Mind 317 Asia. This is often explained by noting that symbolic behavior will be ex- pressed only in particular social, economic, and ecological contexts. Yet it may simply be these, rather than the capacity itself, that was absent during the Middle Palaeolithic. Duff et ai (1992) emphasize the need to take into account the coarse grain of the early Palaeolithic archaeological re- cord when evaluating the evidence for early symbolism and suggest that the criteria put forward by Chase (1991) for identifying symbolic behav- ior-repeated patterning in time and space- could never by met. Duff et al. (1992) extend Lindley and Clark's (1990) argument for a gradual evo- lution of symbolic behavior. The major criticism of this position is that a symbolic capacity cannot be simply switched on or off, up or down but is either totally absent or wholly pervasive (Stringer and Gamble, 1993; Wobst, 1977). This, however, seems analogous to the fallacious argument used by creationists against evolution- capacities, physiological traits, or species are adaptively useful only when present in their complete modern form, and therefore could not have gradually evolved- an argument shown to be false by Dawkins (1986). There has been limited work on explaining the appearance, or elabo- ration, of visual symbolism at the time of the transition to the Upper Pa- laeolithic. As noted above, Davidson and Noble (1989) have suggested that the evolution of depiction, language and visual symbolism are interrelated. Davis (1986) discussed the origin of image making, claiming that "image making originated in the discovery of the representational capacity of lines, marks and blots of color which need not, and often do not, have a repre- sentational status" (1986, p. 194). This is a truism- how could it have been otherwise? As Layton (1986) remarked, we need to develop hypotheses for what natural selection pressure or social function would favor the devel- opment of the necessary cognitive and manual skills: "Why should a blot be taken for a hole or a mark for a thing" (Layton, 1986, p. 205). I have suggested that the evolution of a capacity for visual symbolism is related to the trend away from a domain-specific to a generalized intelligence (Mithen, 1994a). The various elements of this capacity, such as intentional communication, the attribution of meaning, and the ability to categorize images, evolved early in human evolution, but they remained encapsulated until the cognitive processes within each domain became accessible to each other. For instance it is likely that attributing meaning to the trails and tracks of potential prey was an important element of natural history intel- ligence, whereas intentional communication between conspecifics was a critical feature of social intelligence. The practice of making and using vis- ual symbols requires both of these processes and could not have arisen until there was a significant degree of accessibility between social and natu- ral history intelligence. As Gibson (1990, 1993) has argued, the hierarchi-</page><page sequence="14">318 Mitben zation of cognition, in terms of new capacities being built by combining others at a lower level in a cognitive hierarchy, is likely to be an important feature of the evolution of mind. Middle Palaeolithic Burial and Symbolic Behavior In addition to engraved artifacts, burials have also been used as evi- dence for Middle Palaeolithic symbolism. The notion here is that the act of burial, or the grave itself, may have had symbolic meanings and that this may be identified by recognizing the intentional placing of grave goods, positioning of the body or graveside ritual (Duff et al, 1992). Gargett (1989) reassessed the evidence for Middle Palaeolithic burials and claimed that there was no case in which intentional burial could be demonstrated. Since then, the publication of the KMH2 Neanderthal from Kebara, ca. 60-65 kya (Bar-Yosef and Vandermeersch, 1991; Bar-Yosef et al., 1992) pro- vides an example of Middle Palaeolithic burial that is difficult to refute, particularly in light of the attention paid by the excavators to site formation processes. However, there is no necessary relationship between burial and symbolic behavior. Corpses may be placed in pits and covered with earth for hygienic reasons or to deter scavengers and have no symbolic meanings. As with engraved artifacts, there continues to be considerable disagreement about the existence and interpretation of Middle Palaeolithic burials (e.g., Belfer-Cohen and Hovers, 1992; Dibble and Chase, 1993; Stringer and Gamble, 1993). Although no agreement has been reached, many of the issues surrounding the problems of identifying intentional burial, especially with regard to the earlier Palaeolithic, have been clarified. Although Middle Palaeolithic hominids may not have been creating visual symbols in the form of either durable art objects or burials, this would not necessarily imply that they did not live in a mentally constructed world in which natural and artificial objects were invested with symbolic meaning. To address this issue archaeologists may benefit by drawing on theoretical perspectives developed in the social, rather than natural, sci- ences. This is indeed common practice among later prehistorians, but there are few attempts to use social and critical theory to facilitate interpretation of the Palaeolithic archaeological record. One notable attempt, however, has been by Byers (1994), who attempts to draw on "action theory" to explore the relationship between the emergence of symboling behavior and the Middle/Upper Palaeolithic transition. He concludes that Middle Palae- olithic hominids did indeed lack any symbolic dimension to their behavior and characterizes the transition as marking the start of rule-governed and goal-oriented human action. As the commentators on this paper noted, By-</page><page sequence="15">Palaeolithic Archaeology and the Evolution of Mind 319 ers proposal has several severe weaknesses, notably the mistaken assump- tion that all features of Middle Palaeolithic technological variability can be accounted for by Dibble's (1987) resharpening model for scrapers (Schlanger and d'Errico, 1994) and that the Middle/Upper Palaeolithic transition is indeed a discrete event involving a simultaneous change be- tween human anatomy and material culture (Straus, 1994). These valid criticisms emphasize the difficulties of integrating both complex theoretical concepts from critical theory and the complex date sets from the Palaeo- lithic archaeological record. THE EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL LEARNING The term "culture" normally implies behavior that is "learned" rather than under direct genetic control. While this distinction is ultimately false- both genes and learning contribute to every behavioral trait (Bateson, 1983)- the evolution of learning capacities is clearly a critical facet of the evolution of mind and underpins modern cultural behavior. Cosmides and Tooby (1989), adopting an extreme modularity position, argue against a generalized learning mechanism in favor of a multitude of learning mecha- nisms, each dedicated to specific types of activity. The more conventional position is for a generalized learning capacity, the selective pressure for which is likely to have been highly fluctuating and unpredictable environ- ments (see Mithen, 1990, pp. 21-51). During the last decade there has been a considerable growth of inter- est in the processes of learning, notably those that are described as social learning and seen as the basis for cultural transmission. Drawing on the work of Boyd and Richerson (1985), Shennan (1991) has made a powerful argument that the course of cultural development will be most effectively studied by focusing on cultural transmission in a Darwinian framework. In others words, we can improve our understanding of macroscale cultural change by developing that of the microscale processes of social learning. The processes of social learning have been a major issue of discussion and debate in nonhuman primate studies during the last decade, focussing on the extent and nature of imitation (Whiten, 1989). This debate has con- siderable implications for Palaeolithic archaeology. Few would deny that the direct imitation of observed behavior is a major process by which hu- mans become enculturated and is critical to cultural development (Meltzoff, 1988). A decade ago imitation had also been assumed to be the underlying mechanism by which cultural behaviors had spread through monkey and ape populations, such as the potato washing technique among Japanese macaques (Kawamura, 1959). This has now been questioned by a critical</page><page sequence="16">320 Mìthen analysis of existing data (e.g., Galef, 1976, 1988, 1990) and new experimen- tal studies (e.g., Fragaszy and Visalberghi, 1990; Tomasello, 1990; Tomasello et al., 1987, 1993; Visalberghi and Fragaszy, 1990). The conclusion from this work is that imitation is rare, if not absent, among ape and monkey populations. Other processes of social learning, such as social facilitation and stimulus enhancement, are now thought ade- quate to explain the spread of "cultural" behavior. These arguments have been partly countered, however, by noting that they rely on observation of primates in artificial laboratory contexts. Those who have made extensive and detailed observations in the wild are more prepared to accept that capacities for imitation exist among apes (e.g., McGrew, 1994). Moreover, Boesch (1993) has described what appears to be teaching of a juvenile chimpanzee by its mother of the most appropriate method to use stone tools for cracking nuts involving the juvenile imitating its mother's actions. Yet such active teaching appears extremely rare. Even if imitation and teaching are present among apes, they appear to be far less significant in the transmission of cultural behavior than in modern humans. Apes appear to have a "mental block" in the widespread utilization of these for acquiring knowledge about behavior such as tool use. As Tomasello (1990) notes, each generation of chimpanzee tool users appears to be struggling to reach the level of skill attained by the previous generation. The implications of such primate studies for the interpretation of early Palaeolithic technology may be profound. We must ask whether the tech- nological contrasts between chimpanzees and early hominids, the extent of which remains debated (Toth and Schick, 1993; Wynn and McGrew, 1989), can be accounted for simply by a development in social learning processes related to the imitation of motor actions, rather than any other cognitive development, such as a linguistic capacity, a symbolic capacity or a more developed technological intelligence. Lake (1994) has recently constructed a very powerful argument that searching for carcasses during the Plio-Pleis- tocene would have created a selective pressure for enhanced social learning capacities. Certainly by the time of Acheulian technology the standardization of bifaces suggests that imitation did indeed play a major role in the trans- mission of technical skills among certain K erectos and archaic H. sapiens populations. The complexity of biface technology may imply active teaching (Dennell, 1994), which is rare if not absent among apes (Boesch, 1993; Tomasello et al, 1993). But imitation as a means to acquire technological knowledge does not appear universal, as apparent in the pebble/flake/core industries of the Middle Pleistocene such as the Clactonian. Within these the lack of standardized artifact forms and the diversity of knapping tech- niques suggest a predominance of trial and error learning by individuals.</page><page sequence="17">Palaeolithic Archaeology and the Evolution of Mind 321 Consequently, just as with symbolism, or indeed any cognitive ability, ar- chaeologists must explore the social and ecological contexts in which it can be expressed. In this regard I have argued that there is an intimate con- nection among hominid group size, patterns of social learning, and tech- nology (Mithen, 1994c). In small groups the opportunities for social learning are limited, while the incentives for innovation are high. These should result in a technology with low levels of technical skill and high degrees of variability in artifact form and knapping methods. In contrast, when hominids are living in large group sizes, social learning plays a very important role in the acquisition of technical knowledge, and incentives for innovation should be low, resulting in standardized artifacts in terms of morphology and knapping procedures, but low degrees of variability in space and time. I suggest that this model fits the Lower Palaeolithic data from southeast England, where it appears that Acheulian assemblages were restricted to glacial environments (Wymer, 1988), during which hominid group size is expected to be relatively large, creating the social context for extensive social learning. Whatever the virtue of that particular model, it attempts to show how discussion of hominid cognition can be, and must be, fully integrated with an understanding of past environments and behavior. As with Aiello and Dunbar's (1993) work concerning language, hominid group size and social interaction emerges as a critical factor in cognitive evolution and expression. SUMMARY Any review of archaeological work concerning the evolution of mind must be highly subjective; the issues are complex and the terminology am- biguous-there are no generally agreed definitions for language, intelli- gence or learning. Similarly, there is considerable subjectivity in the organization of the material within a text- simply categorizing material un- der specific headings such as "language" or "intelligence" implies an a priori position concerning the structure of the mind. Neither can a review be ex- haustive, for almost any category of behavior can ultimately be related to mind. Even certain explicitly evolutionary cognitive issues that have been discussed in the recent archaeological literature have been excluded from this paper, including decision making (Mithen, 1990), emotions (Mithen, 1991), memory (Donald, 1991), notation (Marshack, 1993), and planning (Binford, 1989; Roebroeks et ai, 1988). Other aspects of the mind, such as consciousness, have also been avoided for, although they have been sub- stantially discussed during the last few years (e.g., Dennett, 1992; Hum-</page><page sequence="18">322 Mithen phrey, 1992), this has not been within the archaeological literature, and the archaeological implications of this work remain undiscussed. If archaeologists are showing a reluctance to address such aspects of cognition, and as a result bias their interpretations around a limited number of themes such as the evolution of language, so too do they remain rather fixated on the Middle/Upper Palaeolithic transition in Europe. This is also introducing substantial bias into our reconstruction of the evolution of mind. For instance, the greater extent of imposed form on stone tools is still taken to be a significant difference between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic, and one that indicates a significant change in cognition (e.g., Byers 1994; Mellars, 1989b, 1991), yet the imposition of form in the Lower Palaeolithic with regard to the manufacture of distinct handaxe types is ignored in such arguments. Similarly, the greater emphasis on blade tech- nology at the transition continues to be accorded major significance, with no discussion of the blade-dominated industries deeply embedded in the Middle Palaeolithic, such as the Pre-Aurigancian from Haua Fteah and the Amudian from the Near East (Ronen, 1992) other than noting that these are "rare and relatively isolated" (e.g., Mellars 1989b, p. 340). Indeed, these "Pre-Upper Palaeolithic" industries are presenting one of the biggest chal- lenges to a cognitive archaeology of the Palaeolithic. Moreover, there are other issues in the Palaeolithic that require addressing from a cognitive perspective. The redating of H. erectus in Java to 1.8 mya (Swisher et al, 1994) leaves the apparent absence of an archaeological record in Southeast Asia until after 40,000 BP (Bartstra and Basoeki, 1989) an even greater anomaly than it had previously appeared. Can the absence of any lithic assemblages from this period really be attributed to lack of discovery or the use of alternative, nonlithic raw materials? Or do we need to treat the manufacture of stone tools not as a universal but rather as a variable at- tribute of early hominids? If so what is the implication, if any, of this for the early hominid mind? The study of mind demands the collapse of conventional discipline boundaries. Even if the archaeological contribution to our understanding of the evolution of mind during the last 5 years has been limited, there has certainly been a very positive trend toward interdisciplinary work in recent literature (e.g., Gibson and Ingold, 1993). There is also a greater recognition that the study of mind cannot be divorced from other aspects of hominid lifestyles, and cognitive archaeology must be thoroughly inte- grated with studies of past subsistence and social behavior. This is particu- larly important for perhaps the greatest problem, common to each of the issues discussed in this paper, is that the lack of evidence for a cognitive capacity cannot be taken for the absence of that capacity; it may simply not have been expressed. Consequently we need a greater understanding</page><page sequence="19">Palaeolithic Archaeology and the Evolution of Mind 323 of the contexts in which cognitive capacities will be expressed, and this can be achieved only by integrating the study of mind with hominid lifestyles. And when doing this, it is essential that we view early hominids as unique species in themselves, with their own complete cognitive and behavioral repertoires. We should see them as neither "cognitively cranked-up" ver- sions of chimpanzees nor "cognitively watered-down" versions of modern humans. There is limited consensus within the literature on any of the issues addressed in this review. The bias of this reviewer is to favor those models and interpretations that stress the continuities between the human mind and those of other animals: the evolution of mind appears to have been a gradual and continuous process rather than the crossing of a series of cog- nitive rubicons. From the material in this review the following picture emerges: by the early part of the Middle Pleistocene, the nature and in- tensity of social learning appears to be very different to that seen in modern apes, and during the Middle Pleistocene the language faculty is likely to have gradually evolved with an ever increasing symbolic component. During these periods cognition appear to have been relatively domain specific as compared with modern humans but several domains, such as spatial and social intelligence, are likely to have been essentially modern in character. A trend toward a more generalized intelligence is likely to have began in the early part of the late Pleistocene, possibly relating to the increasing importance of language. Ultimately this becomes apparent in the archae- ological record by the start of the Upper Palaeolithic. But it is unlikely that a discrete cognitive rubicon was crossed at any one specific moment in time. As Straus (1994, p. 392) has recently stressed, the record of the transition from the Middle to the Upper Palaeolithic is "complex and sug- gests a fitful, staccato progression composed of elements of continuity and change." Nevertheless, by 40 kyr it is likely that a fully modern, generalized intelligence had evolved, although one still based on a modular architec- ture, and from this higher order cognitive capacities such as visual symbol- ism emerged.
