<plain_text><page sequence="1">650 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY discussed and form a very useful part of the book. His treatment of the problems of the word and sentence and that of categorizing in language is concise and reasonable though not as clear as Sapir's treatment of the same subject. Dr. Graft offers us no new classification of language according to struc- ture; in fact, he puts himself on record as being skeptical of structural clas- sifications chiefly, it appears, because language may vary in form and that, as he sees it, no such classification has succeeded in adequately allowing for such variations. Then, too, the criteria advanced by those who would classify language structurally-such as agglutination, inflection, fusion, etc.-are by no means sufficiently definitive; i.e., a language may have all three of these techniques. All these things are quite true, of course, but this merely makes structural classification more difficult, not impossible. And it cannot be denied, as Professor Graft himself admits, that formal classifications have been of value in the past and are likely to become more valuable as they become more definitive. Strangely enough, Professor Graft does not review Sapir's structural classification of language which some regard as the best so far advanced. In the last part of the book, the author has included a list of the lin- guistic stocks of the world and characterized each. The Indo-European family is best described, the others are characterized only briefly and, in some cases-particularly in the case of the American Indian languages- rather inaccurately. A map is appended showing the present distribution of linguistic stocks. Here, too, the American Indian groups are badly represented; neither their present distribution nor their former distri- bution can be inferred from the map. There is a very good Bibliography. HARRY HOIJER UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO Contributions to the History of Science. By L. C. KARPINSKI and J. G. WINTER. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1930. Pp. xi + 283. It is not possible, in a brief notice, to do more than indicate the con- tents of this volume. It contains two documents of considerable interest to students of the history of science. Mr. Karpinski's portion of the vol- ume contains (a) Robert of Chester's Latin version of Al Khowarizmi's treatise on algebra, Liber algebrae et almucabola, (b) an English version of the same, (c) eight introductory essays stating the significance of Al Kho- warizmi's treatise in the history of mathematics and describing the manu- script upon which the text is based. These historical essays can be read with profit by anyone interested in that period of the history of the sub-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 651 ject. Mr. Winter's portion of the book contains a translation of Nicolaus Steno's Prodromus and four introductory chapters on the life and work of that early "geologist." The book is splendidly illustrated with eleven plates. It reminds one somewhat of Dr. Singer's earlier Studies in the History and Method of Science, but its appeal, even among students of science history, is considerably restricted, owing to its more specialized subject matter. ALBUREY CASTELL UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA The Wisdom of the Body. By WALTER B. CANNON. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1932. Pp. xv +312. A superior distillate, for the educated layman, of modern investigations of the complex chemical and physical factors at work in the body of man and other animals, by a master in this field. In the healthy adult man these diverse forces lead to a dynamic equilibrium or relatively steady state (e.g., the blood pressure, blood volume, heart rate, body size, body weight, etc.), called by Dr. Cannon "homeostasis." The analysis of home- ostasis is the central theme, rendered somewhat anthropomorphic by a title borrowed from the late Professor Starling. The volume, as a whole, is a model in accuracy and lucidity. But the final chapter ("Relation of Biological to Social Homeostasis") is an anticlimax, an excursion into sociological speculation. Argument by analogy may have some merit, if the conclusions lead to experimental tests; otherwise it appears to the re- viewer an infantile pastime if not a nod. This danger of nodding, even on the part of our ablest scientists, when talking too persistently to laymen, crops out but seldom in the scientific chapters of this book. But the head- ing of the Bibliography list is so worded as to make the reader think that all the discoveries and generalizations in physiology of the last hundred years have been made in the author's laboratory in Boston. This is a nod, completely contradicted by the scientific chapters. A. J.
