<plain_text><page sequence="1">FOSTERING THE CUCKOO: EXETER BOOK RIDDLE 9 BY JENNIFER NEVILLE Riddles are generally thought to end once a solution has been found, but Exeter Book Riddle 9, although apparently straightforward and only twelve lines long, has more to offer than a disguised description of a cuckoo. The anthropomorphism that serves as the bird's disguise reveals social commentary regarding the practice of fostering, which may cast light on the hero's childhood in Beowulf. In addition, although the Exeter Book riddles do not demand spiritual or didactic readings, Riddle 9 may support an allegorical interpretation: cuckoo for devil, mother-bird for soul, nest for heart, and cuckoo-egg for sinful thought. Interpreting natural history allegorically has clear precedents, both within and without the Exeter Book, and the idea of continuing the interpretive process past an initial answer can be seen both to underlie the enigmata of the Anglo-Latin tradition and to play an important role in current understanding of the runic riddles of the Exeter Book. This essay thus argues that 'solving' Riddle 9 is only the starting point for interpretation; more than a solution, this text requires a different understanding of the riddle-genre itself. Is imagery in a riddle essentially disposable,'empty and of no importance' once a solution has been reached?1 Is a riddle merely a question with an answer,2 a means to an end? Or is solving a riddle not so much the end of a game as the start of a new one?3 My research leads me to support this latter view. In my discussion of Exeter Book Riddle 9, I aim to show two of the games that can be played not only during but also after its solution has been found: social commentary and spiritual allegory.

(Riddle 9)4 [In these days my father and mother gave me up for dead. There was no spirit in me yet and no life within. Then someone began to cover me with clothing; a very loyal kinswoman protected and cherished me, and she wrapped me with a protective garment, just as gener- ously as for her own children, until under that covering, in accordance with my nature, I was endowed with life amongst those unrelated to me. The protective ladys5 then fed me until I grew up and could set out on wider journeys. She had fewer dear sons and daughters because she did so.] Even today, despite increasingly urban environments, many recognise the para- sitic cuckoo within the anthropomorphic disguise offered by Exeter Book Riddle 9, for the riddle tells a well-known story, famous in the literary tradition both before and after the Anglo-Saxon period. Potential sources for Anglo-Saxon knowledge of this tradition include two Latin texts well documented in Anglo-Saxon England: Pliny's Historia naturalis, which cites Aristotle's earlier account, and Isidore's seventh-century encyclopaedia, the Etymologiae.6 These authors write fairly accurately about the parasitic behaviour of the cuckoo, and thus, even if they had not observed it themselves, those who heard the call might also have read or heard about the insidious, insalubrious lifestyle that lurked behind it, which has earned the cuckoo the epithets 'ever unkynde', 'mortherer', and 'reufullest glotoun' in Chaucer's Parliament ofFowls and 'nasty and subversive' in modern nature-writing.7 4 Text is taken from Bernard J.

Some cuckoo species do not care for their own chicks; instead, they lay their eggs one by one in the nests of other birds and leave foster-parents to feed and protect them. The cuckoo chick is often bigger than its 'brothers and sisters', and it often hatches first. These are not its only advantages, however: more significant is the fact that the cuckoo chick's call is invariably louder and more frequent than that of other nestlings. In fact, one cuckoo chick on its own makes as much noise as a whole brood of ordinary chicks and stimu- lates the same amount of feeding from parent birds.8 This vocal superiority allows the cuckoo chick to dominate the nest and claim the lion's share of the food. It may go further, however. Cuckoo chicks have been observed attempting to push other chicks out of the nest; parent birds finding their own chicks perched precariously on the edge sometimes mistake them for outsiders and eject them. As a result, once mature enough to fly away, the cuckoo chick may leave its foster- parents with smaller or fewer offspring of their own, or even none at all.9 Riddle 9 disguises this process beneath the common riddlic technique of anthropomorphism-ascribing human characteristics to non-human creatures or objects.10 In this case, anthropomorphism involves describing the mother bird as a woman caring for a human child by protecting, clothing, and feeding it. Birds are never mentioned, nor are any tell-tale characteristics such as feathers, beaks, nests, eggs or flight." We can probably assume that most members of an Anglo-Saxon audience, whether male or female, lay or clerical, free or enslaved, had heard cuckoos, because the cuckoo's distinctive cry is used as an apparently traditional marker of the imminent arrival of summer in three Old English poems-The Seafarer, The Husbands Message, and Guthlac.12 Knowing the cry of the cuckoo is not the same as Language and Literature, Variations, 5 (Bern, 2004), 95-114: 100, n. 13 and J.

(edd.), Handbook of the Birds of Europe, the Middle East and North Africa: The Birds of the Western Palearctic, vol. 4: Terns to Woodpeckers (Oxford, 1985), 409-14. 10 Anthromorphism, prosopopoeia, or personification in riddles is often simply assumed by commentators, but for discussion see, for example, E Tupper, Jr (ed.), The Riddles of the Exeter Book (Boston, New York, Chicago, and London, 1910), lxxxix-xci; M.

Orton,'The Technique of Object-Personification in The Dream of the Rood and a Comparison with the Old English Riddles' Leeds Studies in English, 11 (1980), 1-18. 11 The riddler's restraint here is not always matched by that of translators, who sometimes remove the ambiguity of the original language; see, for example, K. Crossley-Holland, trans., The Exeter Riddle Book (London, 1978), 29 and C. Williamson, trans., A Feast of Creatures: Anglo-Saxon Riddle-Songs (Philadelphia, 1982), 7. 12 The Seafarer 53-5; The Husband's Message 22-3; Guthlac A 743-4. Bitterli notes that the cuckoo also appears with a similar function in two Latin poems by Alcuin (100, n. 12).</page><page sequence="4">434 JENNIFER NEVILLE knowing its breeding habits, however, and it is worth noting that, amongst the other tell-tale characteristics that Riddle 9 does not include, we can list the cuckoo's call. This absence is notable, for in other Exeter Book riddles which pertain to birds-Riddle 7 (Swan), Riddle 8 (Nightingale), Riddle 24 (Jay), and Riddle 57 (arguably Swallows)13-voices figure prominently.14 Riddle 9 pointedly does not mention song or voice, even in a coded or anthropomorphised way. Without reference to its distinctive cry, the cuckoo might not have been so easy to identify-not from natural observation, at least, since the cuckoo is a very shy bird, often heard but rarely seen.15 The audience for Riddle 9 need not have included assiduous bird-watchers to recognise the cuckoo, however, for, as mentioned earlier, the cuckoo's natural history was a famous story. The otherwise puzzling paradox of death followed by life in the first two and a half lines is thus probably explained by reference to learned tradition: Isidore states that all birds are born twice, first as dead eggs, and then, after receiving life from the heat of the mother's body, as living birds.16 According to this understanding of the nature of birds, the egg left by the cuckoo really was deadne 'dead' (lb). Its lifelessness is stressed by the elaboration that there was neither feorh 'spirit' (2b) nor ealdor 'life' (3b) within it. It is only later, after the mother bird has incubated it, that the cuckoo becomes eacen gceste 'endowed with life' (8b), which is according to its gesceapu, its 'nature' (7b) as a bird. This transformation from inanimate foetus to animate bird seems to have been a favourite topic of riddlers, for it is exploited by Symphosius, Eusebius, the anonymous author(s) of the Bern riddles, and Alcuin.17 This recourse to the literary tradition suggests that there is more than natural science to be investigated here.18 Decoding the anthropomorphic disguise worn by the cuckoo is not the end of the story. Rather, it is the beginning Its association with the arrival of spring is well attested in later times, too; see Hardy, 47-52. 13 A. Welsh, 'Swallows Name Themselves: Exeter Book Riddle 55', American Notes and Queries, 3 (1990), 90-93. The solution 'swallows' is also accepted by Dietrich, Tupper, Mackie, Baum, and Williamson; other solutions include 'gnats' 'starlings', 'stormclouds', 'hailstones', 'raindrops', 'bees, 'midges' 'swifts', 'jackdaws, 'crows', 'musical notes' 'damned souls','demons' and 'house martins'; see Muir, vol. 2, p. 663 and D. K. Fry,'Exeter Book Riddle Solutions' Old English Newsletter, 15 (1981), 22-33. 14 In Riddle 7 (Swan), however, it is the feathers, not the bird, that sing. 15 W. George and B.

Thus, if we do not discard the supposedly disposable image when we 'solve' the riddle as 'cuckoo' the text can reveal social commentary. Focusing on the surface imagery reveals an idealised portrait of a mother caring for her children: the frifemceg 'protective woman' (9a) covers, dresses, and feeds her sons and daughters until they are able to travel more widely, to walk independently, to leave the home. This progression from protected helplessness to independence matches neatly with the depiction of child-raising in another Old English poem, The Fortunes ofMen: Ful oft buat gegonge6, mid godes meahtum, kaette wer ond wif in woruld cenna6 bearn mid gebyrdum ond mid bleom gyrwa6, tennak ond tatat, opaet seo tid cyme6, gegaeO gearrimum, hat ha geongan leomu, liffastan leoku, geloden weorka6. Ferga6 swa ond feka6 faeder ond modor, giefa6 ond gierwap. (Fortunes ofMen 1-8a)'9 [Very often through God's power it happens that a man and woman bring a child into the world through birth, and they adorn him with colours, cheer and cherish him, until the time comes, until it happens with the count of years, that the young limbs, infused with life, become fully grown. Thus the father and mother carry him and help him to walk, give him gifts and guide him.]20 Like the gnomic poem, Riddle 9 presents for acceptance and affirmation a role for women in society as well as considerable emphasis on the importance of family relations. This is moral regulation, promoting good behaviour through positive role models.21 This sunny picture, however, is revealed as a sinister nightmare by the final lines: the apparently laudable generosity of the good mother leads to the death of her own children, her swesra...suna ond dohtra 'dear sons and daughters' (llb-12a). Her virtue is thus not only complicit in the murder of her kin but the direct cause of it. This murder takes place in silence, without mention of motiva- tion or method; the text says nothing about deception, the commandeering of limited resources, or the ejection of competitors. Yet the gap is not entirely 19 Although I have not adopted his title for the poem ('The Fates of Mortals'), text is taken from Muir, Vol. 1, 244. 20 With Bradley, Crossley-Holland and Gordon I translate beam as 'child' although it could equally refer to 'children': see S. A. J. Bradley, trans., Anglo-Saxon Poetry (London, 1982), 341; K. Crossley-Holland, trans., The Anglo-Saxon World (Woodbridge, Suffolk, 1982), 304; and R. K. Gordon, trans., Anglo-Saxon Poetry (London, 1926), 318; but cf. T. A. Shippey, trans., Poems of Wisdom and Learning in Old English (Cambridge, 1976), 59. Although the gender of the child is not specified, I have assumed it to be male, since it seems most likely that him in 9a refers to the child ('to him') rather than the parents ('to them'). I also follow Bradley, Crossley-Holland, and Gordon rather than Shippey in interpreting mid bleom as a reference to coloured clothing rather than physical form. 21 M.

From the cuckoo's perspective, of course, the sequence of events is entirely positive. The poet's emotive use of swxesra...suna ond dohtra suggests, however, that a human audience might not share this perspective. Instead, the riddle can be seen to comment on the disruptive potential of fosterage. Fosterage is part of a very large social phenomenon with complex ramifications: the abandonment of children. Although poorly understood and documented in modern scholarship,22 abandoning one's own children and caring for others' chil- dren both appear to have been significant aspects of early medieval demographics across Europe.23 The reasons for giving up children varied considerably. A poor household, for example, might give up a child because it lacked sufficient resources to ensure its survival. A noble household might give up a child to reduce the number of heirs. Unwanted children could be sold into slavery, fostered by a family of higher or lower status, or given to a monastery, as Bede was.24 Fosterage was more than a method of dealing with unwanted children, however; it was also a method of creating useful relationships-a 'constructed kinship' which could form the basis of political alliances,25 and could prove more reliable than bonds between actual relatives.26 It could also be to the great benefit of the fosterling and serve as a form of education, particularly for noble boys.27 Even quite recently it was a common custom amongst the nobility to send sons and daughters to be raised in other courts. It has been argued that fosterage was 'integral to Anglo-Saxon childrearing practices'28 The most common type of fosterage was the employment of a nurse to serve as a foster-mother within the family home, but some children were raised outside it: King Alfred is said to have fostered some of his thegns' children in his own royal household, for example.29 This kind of external fostering is well 22 P.

Boswell, The Kindness ofStrangers: The Abandonment of Children in Western Europe from Late Antiquity to the Renaissance (London, 1988). Boswell refers to the cuckoo at 84 and Riddle 9 at 215.

I shall briefly address the last of these. As he looks back over his life before his fight with the dragon, Beowulf notes that he was a foster-child from the age of seven, and that King Hrethel held and protected him just as he did his own sons: Ic was syfanwintre, ka mec sinca baldor, freawine folca, aet minum fweder genam; heold mec ond hefde Hre6el cyning, geaf me sinc ond symbel, sibbe gemunde; nxes ic him to life la6ra owihte, beorn in burgum, konne his bearna hwylc, Herebeald ond Haecyn o66e Hygelac min. (Beowulf2428-34)33 ['I was seven years old when the master of treasure, the lordly friend of the people, received me from my father. King Hrethel protected and kept me and gave me treasure and feasts; he remembered this relationship. As a warrior in the enclosures, I was in no way more hated than any of his sons, Herebeald, Hae6cyn, and my Hygelac, as long as he lived?] The language here is positive, with particular emphasis on the affectionate nature of the relationship provided through litotes ('in no way more hated'= loved equally warmly),34 yet the ideas expressed are also strikingly like those at the heart of the riddle. Although there is no suggestion from this particular nestling 30 See, for example, the discussion in Parkes,'Celtic Fosterage'; P. Foote and D. M. Wilson, The Viking Achievement: The Society and Culture ofEarly Medieval Scandinavia (London, 1970), 116 and 422; and C. J. Itnyre,'The Emotional Universe of Medieval Icelandic Fathers and Sons' in C. J. Itnyre (ed.), Medieval Family Roles: A Book of Essays, Garland Medieval Casebooks, 15 (New York and London, 1996), 173-96. 31 These few are listed in Parkes,'Celtic Fosterage' 380; Parkes derives his material from F Roeder, Uber die Erziehung der vornehmen angelsiichsischen Jugend in fremden Hdusern (Halle, 1910), 10-20. Cf., however, D. Whitelock's denial of external fosterage in Anglo- Saxon England: see The Beginnings of English Society, 2nd edn, Pelican History of England, 2 (Harmondsworth, 1974), 94. 32 See, for example, Crawford, 125-6; Hirke, 126; Parkes, 'Celtic Fosterage', 380; R.

For detailed discussion of the pervasive use of litotes in Beowulf see R. Frank,</page><page sequence="8">438 JENNIFER NEVILLE that the system by which he was raised was anything other than positive, the riddle suggests problems that are relevant to this royal household, too. If the foster-son received as much as the true sons, resources were split four ways instead of three, and the resulting scarcity could have stimulated competition. We do not hear about such competition, yet, in the lines that immediately follow this glimpse of Beowulf's idyllic childhood, we hear that Herebeald died in an archery 'accident' at the hands of his brother Ha~cyn, that his foster-father, Hrethel, unable either to avenge or forgive, died of grief, and that Ha6cyn died in the interminable war against the Swedes. The fault may not lie with the foster- chick, but the protective fosterer possess progressively fewer dear sons until, ultimately, there are none. Then the fosterling-who is noticeably larger than everyone around him3s-rules the roost. Beowulf is not a cuckoo chick. He pushes no nestlings out of the nest. Even when invited, he only takes the throne when there is no one left from the direct line to hold it, and in his dying words he congratulates himself that he cannot be accused of mornbealo maga 'the murder of kin' (2742a).36 Yet the lengths that the poem goes to show the hero's loyalty to his foster-family perhaps indicate how unique he is in this respect, as in all others. In other royal or noble families, the presence of fosterlings might not have been so healthy, and the eventual departure of such nestlings might indeed have followed horrors that could be laconically summed up by the phrase,'They had fewer dear sons and daughters because they did so? The fictional account of Beowulf's childhood provides a useful context in which to view both the riddle's affirmation of the fostering role for parents and its presentation of the dangers that attend upon this respected institution. Indeed, the riddle provides an opportunity for an audience to entertain very grave doubts about this institution, doubts which are explicitly addressed else- where--for example, in the much fuller accounts of fosterage in Celtic, Old Icelandic, and Old Norse literature.37 In this case, the surface-image of the foster-parent inevitably gives way to the bird, but the scenario from the natural world presents its audience with a distorted but recognisable image of a human social situation, and that image can remain potent long after the riddle-game is over. That is, the story of the cuckoo is clearly different from human experience, and yet, at the same time, it is familiar, too. The partiality of the image from the 'The Incomparable Wryness of Old English Poetry', in J. Walmsley (ed.) Inside Old English: Essays in Honour ofBruce Mitchell (Oxford, 2006), 59-73. 35 The Danish coastguard notes Naefre ic maran geseah/eorla ofer eorfan 'I have never seen a bigger man on earth' (Beowulf247b-8a). 36 Beowulf's mention of family here creates additional connections with Riddle 9, as the riddle notes that the foster-mother is a mege 'kinswoman' (4a), even if the other nestlings are ungesibbum-that is, not directly related (8a). 37 Colin Ireland,'The Ambiguous Attitude Toward Fosterage in Early Irish Literature' in D.

As mentioned earlier, modern biology has attempted to fill in that gap by pointing to the cuckoo chick's vocal superiority: instinct makes the mother bird respond to the chick's demanding calls.40 Pliny filled the gap with parental pride: the mother bird delights in herself for having produced a chick of such great size and beauty and thus willingly abandons her own, apparently inferior chicks to death.41 Riddle 9, in contrast, marks the gap with y but makes no attempt to fill it. Such a yawning gap calls out for explanation and consequently may motivate yet another intepretation. Thus the riddle may signify not only a bird, not only the dangers of adoptive kinship, but also the Christian drama of damnation. That is, if we do not discard the supposedly disposable image when we 'solve' the riddle as 'cuckoo' and if we still do not discard it after we have contemplated its social commentary, the text can reveal yet another story, and yet another purpose: moral teaching.42 The second door opened by the successful guess of 'cuckoo' leads to an interpretive process sometimes considered characteristic of medieval thought: spiritual allegory, in which the material world is read to reveal 38 This rhetorical use of animals is discussed in K. Soper, What is Nature?: Culture, Politics and the Non-Human (Oxford, 1995), 82. Cf. C. Williamson, A Feast of Creatures: Anglo-Saxon Riddle-Songs (Philadelphia, 1982), 23-8 and J. E. Salisbury, The Beast Within: Animals in the Middle Ages (New York and London, 1994), 103-36. Salisbury argues, however, that this function for animals only arose in the twelfth century.

As is well known, the bestiary-tradition, based originally upon the Greek Physiologus, contains descriptions of animals that are interpreted morally and didactically.44 That is, the characteristics and activities of individual animals are shown to represent a system of spiritual truths and thus teach moral behaviour. The Bestiary was extremely popular in the later medieval period, and many beautifully illustrated manuscripts remain.45 The tradition was also extant earlier, as is confirmed within the Exeter Book itself, for it contains three chapters from the Physiologus: one on the panther, which represents Christ, one on the whale, which represents the devil, and one, unfortunately very fragmentary, on a bird, which has rather speculatively been identified as the partridge.46 The panther, whale, and putative partridge appear in the Exeter Book three poems before the Riddles begin, and they may be considered part of the context for the riddle on the Cuckoo. This point needs to be argued, not assumed, however, for few of the ninety-five (or so) riddles contained in the Exeter Book are commonly viewed as having spiritual, didactic solutions,47 and the bestiary-entries' explicit instructions to undertake allegorical interpretation are notably absent from the riddles.48 Indeed, it should be noted that I do not intend to argue that the allegorical interpretation that follows is the correct and final response to the riddle. Nevertheless, the model of interpreting a literal text allegorically to represent spiritual truths is well-established in 43 See, for example, Augustine's De doctrina Christiana 2.39; for discussion, see M. Irvine, The Making of Textual Culture: 'Grammatica'and Literary Theory, 350-1100 (Cambridge, 1994), 173-89. 44 C. Clair, Unnatural History: An Illustrated Bestiary (London, 1967), 12; M. J.

Although G. K. Jember has proposed a series of spiritual allegorical readings for other Exeter Book riddles, these solutions have not been generally accepted. See G. K.

Kitson goes so far as to suggest that the interpretive process associated with the Bestiary is antithetical to the riddles: see 'Swans and Geese in Old English Riddles', Anglo-Saxon Studies in Archaeology and History, 7 (1994), 79-84: 82, n. 11.</page><page sequence="11">FOSTERING THE CUCKOO: EXETER BOOK RIDDLE 9 441 Anglo-Saxon England49 and, more specifically, in the Exeter Book, not only in the three Physiologus-chapters, but also in the much longer translation of Lactantius' The Phoenix near the beginning of the manuscript.50 Thus, although the immediate riddling context does not encourage a spiritual, allegorical reading, the context of the Exeter Book does allow for a spiritual, didactic response to the yawning gap marked by fy. The story begins on fissum dagum 'in these days' (la). For a bird or a human foster-mother, this phrase is a simply a line- filling way of indicating the present time. In the context of a spiritual allegory of the cuckoo, however, Jissum 'these' is potentially more meaningful: it may hint that the days in question are issere leana dagum 'these loaned days' (Instructions for Christians 24b)5s of this earthly life, what The Seafarer describes as fis deade lif, Iene on londe 'this dead life, loaned on the land' (65-5).52 They may also refer more particularly to the end days, the endenyht- stan dagum fissere worulde 'last days of this world' which were, as Wulfstan assured his listeners, wel gehende 'very near'.53 In this context of last things and imminent final judgement, an allegorical interpretation of Riddle 9 can look through the famous story from natural history to find a moral tale that fills the gap in the text with the temptation of the devil. In such a reading, the adult cuckoo represents the devil, the mother-bird the soul, the nest the heart, and the egg a sinful thought. Before pursuing the text's narrative of damnation, however, it is worth noting some of the issues that surround my identification of bird, nest, and egg as soul, heart, and thought, for it is not self-evident that a soul should have a heart, or even that a soul should have thoughts. The complex relationship between mind, soul, and self in Anglo-Saxon literature has been discussed in detail by Godden, Low, Harbus, and Matto, amongst others.54 Their studies have shown that, despite some 49 Although he overstates his case, see, for example, B. E Huppe, Doctrine and Poetry: Augustine's Influence on Old English Poetry (New York, 1959). 50For discussion of the Old English poem's complex allegorical reading of Lactantius' poem, see, for example, J.

It is beyond the scope of this essay fully to explore this issue, but this well-documented ambiguity renders the idea of a soul possessing thoughts and a heart plausible, I believe. In fact it is possible to dispose of the problem simply by interpreting the mother-bird not as the soul but rather as Everyman (or Everywoman). I have nevertheless chosen to identify the bird as the soul because of the links between mind/heart/spirit and birds in both The Wanderer and The Seafarer, as well as the long-standing tradition of representing the soul visually as a bird.55 If this constellation of soul, heart, and thought be accepted, the story of damnation can be seen to follow a predictable plot-line. The mother-bird/soul busily goes about her earthly life and thus does not recognise the alien egg left in the nest of her heart by the devil. At the moment of insertion, the sinful thought is merely an abstraction and thus 'dead': it is the potential for sin, but it does not 'live' without the soul's consent. The soul's other thoughts, those proper to her as a divine spirit wedded to a body by God,56 are, for the moment, safe. The story goes on, however. The duped mother-bird of natural history begins to incubate the cuckoo egg along with her other eggs as if it were her own, cover- ing it with the warm, protective garment of her feathers. Allegorically, the inert thought brought into the heart by the devil is now embraced by the soul. The soul now calls the thought her own and believes that it originates in herself. As we have already seen, the warmth of the mother-bird's embrace, according to medieval ornithology, brings life to the lifeless egg in accordance with its nature. In the same way, the sinful thought, previously inert, now comes to life in accordance with its nature. The language used to describe this process reveals some of the ambiguity of eacen (8b) obscured by my initial translation. An egg may be simply 'endowed' with life, but a sinful thought could be 'enlarged; 'great' or, 73 (2001), 11-22; A.

That is, the previously harmless thought not only thrives amongst the soul's own virtuous thoughts; it also begins to exceed these thoughts or even fight against them. If this sinful thought is 'pregnant', worse is yet to come. The mother bird feeds the cuckoo chick until it is mature enough to leave the nest. The soul fosters the sinful thought until it is manifested outside the heart in sinful action itself. The result in both cases is tragic but understated. For the hapless bird, her laborious devotion yields fewer of her own offspring. 'Fewer' may be litotes for none, but the understatement goes further. Even if we accept 'fewer' at face value, the riddle is, as we have seen, silent about the tragic fate of the chicks that do not survive; we are not told of the wasting hunger or the fatal fall from the nest. This may not be 'Nature, red in tooth and claw's58 but it is not pretty. Similarly, for the soul that has not only embraced a sinful thought but also allowed it to escape the confines of its heart to become manifest in the world, the result is not only fewer virtuous thoughts but fewer good deeds, especially if the eacen 'pregnant' thought gives rise to one of the Deadly Sins, the ones that lead inevitably to further sins. The offspring that the soul should have produced-the good deeds that should have been recorded and judged at Doomsday59-are thus diminished. These deeds seem to be the offspring referred to by the soul addres- sing her dead body in Worcester Fragment G: Unker team is forloren, be wit scolden teman.

You should have been the father to our children and I their mother. We should have fostered children and brought them to Christ.] If this were not the soul speaking, these 'children' would probably indicate actual births, meant to swell the population of Christendom. Strictly speaking, however, the union of body and soul on its own cannot bear such fruit; another body and soul are required. In contrast, the ability to conceive good deeds requires no other partners and is only lost when soul and body are parted. In the case of the bird-soul, who is not yet dead, all is not lost: she may still conceive offspring in future. However, as in the late medieval morality play, Everyman, her Good Deeds 57 See DOE, s.v. eacen. 58 Alfred Lord Tennyson, In Memoriam A. H. H., LVI. 59 The accounting image of the book of good deeds and the book of sins is a common- place.

Once again, the laconic 'fewer sons and daughters' masks a very serious outcome: this time not merely suffering and death but the prospect of damnation. The obvious response to my analysis is: 'Why?' Why should a reader proceed to an allegorical reading-or even social commentary-from a simple riddle describing the natural world? The Physiologus provides one answer: because descriptions of the natural world do call for interpretation, especially moral ones.62 The Physiologus-partridge, for example, which exists, although only in fragmentary form, in the Exeter Book, imagines the bird as the devil and eggs as souls. The Latin text describes the drama of temptation and conversion as follows: Adeo autem fraudulenta, ut alter alterius ova diripiat. Verumptamen fraus fructum non habet. Nam dum pulli audiunt vocem proprie genitricis naturali quodam instinctu hanc que eos fovit relinqunt, et ad eam que eos genuit revertuntur. Huius exemplum imitatus est diabolus qui generationem eterni conditoris rapere contendit, et si quos insipientes et sensu proprii vigoris carentes aliquo modo poterit congregare, fovet illos illecebris corporalibus. Set ubi vox Christi audita fuerit ab eis, sumentes sibi alas spirituales provide evolant, et se Christo commendant.63 [Moreover, (the partridge) is so deceitful that one will snatch away the eggs of another. Yet the deception bears no fruit, for, when the chicks hear the voice of their own mother, through a natural instinct they abandon the one who fostered them and return to the one who bore them. The devil is an imitator of (the partridge's) example. He strives to seize the offspring of the eternal creator, and, if he should collect in some way fools who lack an understanding of their own strength, he fosters them with physical enticements. But when the voice of Christ has been heard by them, taking up their spiritual wings they prudently fly away and entrust themselves to Christ.] The partridge, a real bird living in the natural world, thus provides a visual model for the operation of the devil, using the same motif of hatchlings in nests, although in a set of relationships different from that proposed here for the allegory of the cuckoo. In the Physiologus, at least, natural history leads quite naturally to morality, and the movement from cuckoo to devil for which I argue here seems equivalent to the movement from partridge to devil. 61 Everyman 482-8; for text see Medieval Drama: An Anthology, ed.

Aldhelm, Eusebius, Tatwine, and Boniface all provide solutions as titles to their riddles. In such cases, the 'game' is clearly not to guess the answer, because the 'solution' is known even before the question. In fact, the text mystifies what is already known. A good example of such mystification is Aldhelm's 86th enigma: Aries Sum namque armatus rugosis cornibus horrens, Herbas arvorum buccis decerpo virentes, Et tamen astrifero procedens agmine stipor, Culmina caelorum quae scandunt celsa catervis. Turritas urbes capitis certamine quasso Oppida murorum prosternens arcibus altis. Induo mortales retorto stamine pepli; Littera quindecima praestat, quod pars domus adsto.64 [Inasmuch as I am shaggy and armed with ridged horns, I pluck the green plants of the fields with my mouth, and nevertheless as I travel I am attended by a starry band, which ascend the lofty summits of the heavens in throngs. I shatter towered cities with my head's combat, overthrowing walled towns with their tall fortresses. I dress mortals in a robe of twisted thread; the fifteenth letter shows that I am part of a house.] Here the simple Latin word aries 'ram' is approached in four different ways: bio- logical, astronomical, mechanical, and orthographical. The game is not to guess what a ram is but to explore what and how it means, and the answer, appropriately placed before the text that follows it, is merely the starting point. The Exeter Book riddles clearly differ from the Anglo-Latin riddles, in that they do not provide their own solutions. Yet there are exceptions to this generalisation: Riddle 47 practically reveals its solution in its first word (mo66e 'moth' the origin of the bookworm); Riddle 23 reverses and misspells its solution as its first word (agof -- boga 'bow'); and Riddles 19, 24, 42, 64 and 75 encode their solutions in runes in various ways. In each of these cases, the presentation of the answer is not the end of the process, for the worm's devouring of books in Riddle 47 must be understood in terms of metaphors of reading, agof in Riddle 23 must be both reversed (foga) and corrected (boga), and the runes must be decoded, rearranged, and interpreted.65 64 Text is taken from Aldhelm, Enigmata ex diversis rerum creaturis composita, in R. Ehwald (ed.), Aldhelmi Opera, Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Auctores Antiquissimi 15 (Berlin, 1919), 137. 65 See, for example, Williamson's argument that the decoded runic letters in Riddle 19 (hors, mon, wega, haofoc) are to be further interpreted to yield the solution 'ship' [The Old English Riddles of the Exeter Book (Chapel Hill, 1977), 186-7]; Mark Griffith's more elaborate interpretation ['Riddle 19 of the Exeter Book: SNAC, an Old English Acronym' Notes and Queries, 237 (1992), 15-16]; and Roberta Dewa's comments on these arguments ['The Runic Riddles of the Exeter Book: Language Games and Anglo-Saxon Scholarship', Nottingham Medieval Studies, 39 (1995), 26-36].</page><page sequence="16">446 JENNIFER NEVILLE Although most definitions of the riddle-genre posit a strictly limited, two-part structure (question and solution), Riddle 9, I believe, has at least four parts: question, solution, social commentary, and spiritual allegory. Perhaps, then, it is not a riddle at all. It is worth noting that Riddle 9 does not end with an explicit riddle-ending like saga hwaet ic hatte 'say what I am called'; it is only its position in the Exeter Book 'riddle collection' amongst texts that do possess this ending, that guarantees its genre.66 It may be more useful to think of it as an enigma:67 not a text that hides a secret for the purpose of maintaining power over its audience but rather one 'capable of simultaneous explanation on many different registers of meaning, all of which are equally valid, and... able to open up an intermediate space that is not necessarily bound to be filled'68 The game that it presents to its audience thus does not end with any 'solution' As we have seen, aspects of this game can be observed in other, related texts-in, for example, Aldhelm's Enigma 86 (Aries 'ram'), where the solution is the starting point for an exploration of how and what the word means, in the Physiologus, where natural imagery points beyond itself to moral truths, and in the runic riddles, where each text presents different types of encryption, requiring different levels and types of effort. Like these texts, Riddle 9 initiates a process of interpretation that continues past its solution. Recognising the cuckoo is merely the beginning of the story.
