In a general way, contradiction comprehends all propositions which may not be affirmed at the same time. Contradiction may also arise through the collision of two ideas in the same proposition. This principle is to be found in all the facts of intelligence, beliefs, judgments, ideas, reasonings, perceptions, and, no doubt, even sensations. The feelings also contain contradictions, although the affective life, like the intellectual life, tends toward the absence of contradiction in its own field. Again, the will and action in general are full of logical contradictions. When we enlarge our idea of contradiction to embrace that of opposition, it becomes indefinitely frequent, for reality is made up of, and only exists through, opposition and harmony. Each idea, each feeling, each psychic fact is a more or less complex organization and the elements which compose it, as well as the elements of these elements, are in states of harmony and of contradiction. When we see the generality of con- tradiction and its close connection with other forms of opposition, we see that perhaps logical contradiction has not the absolute value attributed to it by logicians. The impossibility of union for a common end, practical, affective, or purely intellectual, is what gives to contradiction its especial character. It is not the static nature of things, but their activity, their dynamic quality, their capacity for being combined into systems, that is of importance. An absolute contradiction represents a total inability of two propositions uniting for a common end. An absolute identity (A = A) is a useless truism. Let us suppose in its place a partial and abstract identity. This identity would mean that A' may be substituted for A in a given combination. Experience yields us innumerable instances of psychic elements and abstract qualities, which, without being identical, and resembling each other in very diverse ways, present certain analogies, and may be substituted one for the other, while 68o</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 68i preserving the general appearance of the systems in which they inhere. Like its opposite, discord, harmony results from the meeting of tendencies which at once oppose and accord, are partially identical and partially different. Absolute contradiction and absolute identity are the limits toward which we ascend and descend in our interpretation of reality. That there may be a real logical contradiction, it is necessary that the same quality be affirmed and denied of the same thing at the same time and in the same connection. Yet things or ideas are never so completely opposed that they may not be united in certain cases toward a common end. Even mathematics does not give us absolute identities or differences. We only conceive mathematical identity as absolute when we strip it of all that renders compared terms concrete. Among concrete facts we always have to do with phenomena sub- jected to changing conditions. In particular, biology, psychology, and the social sciences show us that it is not the principle of contradiction which teaches us about reality, but reality which teaches us concerning contra- dictions. Many of the dilemmas which we impose upon reality have no real meaning. The fact is that we know nothing which is absolutely contradic- tory. In the affective life, the apparently absolute contradictions are to be explained by diversity of occasions, the complexity of inclinations, and so forth. Thus, although there are no absolute contradictions in any depart- ments of our experience, there are latent contradictions of a relative character in all our ideas, beliefs, feelings, and acts. All the elements of which our nature is composed, in our state of incomplete harmony, all our desires, all our tendencies, are in a measure individualistic and hostile in some degree to each other. This is as true of our beliefs and our doctrines as of our feelings, passions, and appetities. There is a constant action and reaction between experience and speculation, old contradictions disappearing and new ones arising. The accord of ideas appears to be a sort of incidental attainment. For, at bottom, all ideas, feelings, judgments, and psychic states tend to con- tradict, simply because they exist. Their mutual existence means difference and the difference means opposition. If logic has for its aim the best system- atization of thought and the greatest intellectual profit, it must take cognizance of these partial contradictions which go to make up the relative state of har- mony in which we exist. This greatest intellectual profit itself demands certain contradictions. Otherwise, we could not think in a complex way. In fact, we could not think at all without some contradictions. This may seem opposed to the very definition of logic, but is a procedure essential to science, viz., in scientific hypotheses. Thus, a logic which is to be of the most value would demand, like our ethical practice, some sacrifices, or the acceptance of 'a little evil for a great good.' The rigorous logic which absolutely proscribes contradictions remains an ideal impossible to attain, like absolute contradiction itself, or like identity. The r6le of logic should be to regulate the conflicts of ideas and beliefs in such a way as to arrive at the greatest possible intellectual profit, but without attempting to suppress these conflicts completely. There seem to be two classes of permissible contradictions, the first comprising ideas</page><page sequence="3">682 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIX. belonging to quite different intellectual domains, the other concerning realms of knowledge as yet poorly organized, or in process of transformation. J. RAYMOND TUTTLE. Die Ideenlehre in modernem Gewande. OSKAR PROCHNOW. Ar. f. sys. Ph., XVI, I, PP- 1-13. The writer maintains that there is a fundamental similarity between Plato's doctrine of Ideas and the theories of Schopenhauer, of Johannes Reinke, and of E. von Hartmann. Plato teaches that the material world of sense-percep- tion is only the copy or image of an eternal, changeless, and immaterial world of reality, the world of Ideas. Ideas are the cause of phenomenal objects, yet they are not lost in their effects but are eternal. They must, therefore, be regarded as purpose no less than as cause,-they are final cause. The various objects of nature, the heavenly bodies, and the universe as a whole, are organisms whose parts function in harmony with each other and with the whole. The origin, growth, and decay of an object is due to an immanent dynamic principle called soul which represents the causality of the Idea and fashions the object according to form and measure. Numbers and mathe- matical figures constitute that which is essential and permanent in phenomena and are therefore to be classed intermediately between Ideas and the objects of sense-perception. Schopenhauer also regards the world as phenomenal, referring to it as the objectification of an eternal reality or thing-in-itself called will. Objects have a relative permanence only because they are mani- festations of that which is absolutely permanent. Plato's conception of the hierarchy of Ideas is revived in Schopenhauer's description of the various planes of nature or of the objectification of will. The philosophy of the latter is the more anthropomorphic, because he refers to the thing-in-itself back of all nature as will. Partly on this account, no doubt, the similarity of his philosophy of nature to Lamarckianism was overlooked until the recent rise of psychovitalism. Reinke speaks of dominants (Dominanten) which he de- scribes as the principles which give direction to the world energy; they are the causes of the specific forms of the various plants and animals,-the im- manent creative or formative principles that determine the characteristic growth and development of organisms. These dominants manifest themselves only through change and growth and yet they are not consumed in their effects nor do they perish with them, but they are permanent; although they are not conscious creative agents, they are more nearly analogous to intelli- gence than to energy, since they must be regarded as final ends or purposive energy. Thus, Reinke's theory of dominants is nothing other than a "mate- rialistic doctrine of ideas." The theory of von Hartmann is very similar to that of Reinke, the conception of dominants appearing under the term "Ober- kraifte." EDWARD L. SCHAUB.</page><page sequence="4">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 683 The Ego-Centric Predicament. RALPH BARTON PERRY J. of Ph., Psy., and Sci. Meth., VII, I, PP. 5-14. The article attempts to discover whether the ego-centric predicament does or does not constitute evidence for the theory of ontological idealism. Ontological idealism is expressed by the proposition: Everything (T) is defined by the complex, I know T. It is a theory to the effect that T stands in a cognitive relation to the ego and that this relation is indispensable to T. In attempting, however, to discover the precise nature of the modification of the object T, by the knowing ego, the difficulty arises that the ego can never be eliminated. It is impossible for one ever to find any instance of T out of this relation, nor can the problem be solved by defining and subtracting the cogni- tive relationship, for in so doing, this very relationship is established. This is the ego-centric predicament. Three theories have been advanced as to the modification of things by knowing them: the creative, the formative, and the identity theories. These, however, the author shows to be fallacious. He himself has not attempted to do more than show the usual fallacies centered around this conception. His conclusion is that in solving the problem of the modification of things by the mind, the method of analysis is the most prac- ticable. CORRINNE STEPHENSON. Realism as a Polemic and Program of Reform. RALPH BARTON PERRY. J. of Ph., Psy., and Sci. Meth., VII, I3, pp. 337-353; 14, PP. 365-379. The author attempts to summarize the articles of a realistic creed by means of a realistic critique. He discusses three topics: I. General philosophical errors defined on realistic grounds; II. The realistic critique of contemporary philosophy; III. The realistic program of reform. A general lack of logical form and rigor appears in materials and structure of philosophical systems and, because of this, certain complex fallacies have arisen. The fallacy of argument from the ego-centric predicament has become so commonplace as to be regarded as a self-evident truth. The impossibility of eliminating the knower without interrupting observation and of discovering what characters things possess when not known, gives rise both to errors of redundancy and of inference from agreement only. In the fallacy of pseudo-simplicity the method of analysis is in question. Exact procedure refuses to assert the simplicity of any concept until after analysis and thus so-called simple con- cepts, self-consciousness, will, activity, are found to require a complex existence in order to account for what is known about them. The fallacy of trans- cendent implication lies in the supposition that one can, by means of inference or implication, get a footing outside content and the refutation of this fallacy applies equally well to the earlier transcendent or the later transcendental dualism. To assume that a particular turn of any system belongs to such system exclusively is proven false empirically and has led to a fundamental difficulty in philosophy from Platonic universalism to modern particularism, the most common variety of which is found in naturalism. The speculative</page><page sequence="5">684 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIX. dogma, assuming an all-sufficient, all-general principle, has been the most prolific cause of verbal abuses in philosophy; it has also given rise to an unjust and confusing disparagement of positive knowledge. There has been a reliance on the suggestive rather than on the proper denotative or con- notative function of words, and an invention, by combinations of terms, of fictitious concepts, which have not been tested for consistency. For the purposes of the realistic critique of contemporary philosophy, the existing systems, excepting realism, are divided into naturalism, idealism, absolutism, and pragmatism. Realism can agree with naturalism in accepting the results of natural science but must deny that natural science is the only branch of knowledge. In this it agrees with idealism but considers the basal defect of the latter to be subjectivism and the assertion that consciousness is a universal condition of being. Absolutism is essentially the philosophy of the speculative dogma. Realism denies that logic affords any conception of a maximum of truth even defined on the grounds of universal relationship, and in this is in hearty sympathy with pragmatism. It also agrees with the pragmatic conception of truth, strictly and narrowly construed, but brings its charges against certain generalizations with which pragmatism is allied: "humanism" and "anti-intellectualism." The author is inclined to believe that the success of the realistic movement would involve its own disappearance as a propaganda and the appearance of one science of philosophy. The defects of philosophical procedure are not irremediable. The objects of philosophy are the fruit of analysis, its task is the correction of the categories of common sense, and the results must be based on an expert, critical judgment. The present situation affords an opportunity of adopting a more rigorous procedure and assuming a more systematic form. A scrupulous use of words and exact definitions would purge philosophy from many ambiguities and make for a technical vocabulary. Analysis, as a method of exact knowledge in general, and a due regard for logical form, would also clear away much of the confusion. Philosophy must deal with one problem at a time, if it is to obtain exact results; there must be explicit agreement as to the issues at stake. Otherwise tradition is the arbiter of philosophical disputes. Finally, philosophical re- search is to be separated both from the study of the history of philosophy and the interpretation of established belief. The history of philosophy has an indispensable place but not a higher dignity than a direct and independent analysis of special problems. There must be also a detached and theoretical examination of problems as well as an interpretation and reconstruction of common sense and religious belief. Knowledge must first be refined according to its own standards, then brought into circulation. CORRINNE STEPHENSON. The Futility of Absolutism. RALPH BARTON PERRY. Hibbert Journal, VIII, 3, pp. 62i-640. The three characteristic errors of absolutism are formalism, equivocation, and dogmatism. The author discusses Plato and Spinoza as typical absolutists</page><page sequence="6">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 685 of the pre-Kantian period. Formalism is the error which makes the concepts of the absolutist impossible to apply to concrete objects and events. To escape from this he is driven to equivocation. Either the truly general elements of experience are falsely regarded as sufficient to the complex objects in which they are found; or certain conceptions that are truly sufficient within limits, are rendered equivocal through being applied symbolically or analogically beyond those limits. Dogmatism must result in leaving the absolute a mere 'problematic conception.' The argument that all knowledge presupposes such an absolute principle is fallacious because it both uses and condemns limited knowledge. It is not at all necessary that the world should be governed by one purpose; it may be governed by many purposes which together make up a 'collective totality.' Idealists generally agree that Kant marks a new epoch in philosophy. They disagree, however, as to what he accomplished, some holding that it was the discovery of the category of 'syn- thetic unity,' others, the category of 'subjectivity.' If it was the former, it leads to the trivial conclusion that the world is an intelligible whole: if the latter, the new idealism falls into the same pit with pre-Kantian absolutism. Because of its formalism it is of no use to religion. It can only seem to be significant by resort to an equivocation of such words as 'thought,' 'will,' 'personality.' Idealism is left then to whatever satisfaction can be had by asserting the absolute as a purely 'problematic concept.' It can offer no justification for religion unless it be for a religion of renunciation. Even in that case it endeavors to teach the 'lesson of disillusionment' by means of fresh illusions.' HARVEY G. TOWNSEND. Le realisme du continue. J. DE GAULTIER. Rev. Ph., XXXV, i, pp. 39-64. Idealism declares that everything exists in relation and nothing apart from it. Objective and subjective, positive and negative, etc., are analytic terms and do not exist apart from the synthetic act of thought which sustains their relation. Realism may be described as any doctrine which attributes an independent existence to one or the other of these terms. The author has pre- viously shown that realism is one of the causes for the apparent impotency of metaphysics. He now wishes to point out how a solicitude for morality necessarily engenders the realistic hypotheses and how these are especially inspired by the conflict of antinomies. To do this, he proposes to show that M. Bergson, under the constraint of moral bias, seeks to escape the conflict of antinomies by choosing between continuity and discontinuity, and that neces- sity compels him to accord exclusive reality to one of the terms, but to look upon the other in a false perspective. Such a suppression of one of the terms results in leaving no place for knowledge. For the idealist, the end of all existence is the "production of phenomenal reality." Experience shows us that it is precisely the antinomies which bring this about. No reality is conceivable in pure space or time, continuity or discontinuity. The philo- sophical moralist, who looks upon the world as a 'vale of tears' but hopes for</page><page sequence="7">686 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIX. a better, postulates an evolution of the imperfect to the perfect. Not wishing to admit the opposition of continuous and discontinuous as self-conciliated in the genesis of phenomenal reality, and seeking beyond the phenomenal for a new reality, he identifies it either with the thesis or the antithesis. M. Renouvier and the principal neo-criticists have attributed to reality an entirely discontinuous nature. M. Bergson, on the contrary, considers it continuous. He looks upon space as the cause of the tendency of the mind to seek a begin- ning and a limit. It is because this notion of space has been read into time and quality that we have the conflict of antinomies. He declares the phenom- enal to be contaminated by the spatial illusion. To this he opposes a true reality from which he would eliminate all space perspective. In seeking to reconstruct the pure forms of quality and duration by eliminating the dis- continuous, he reduces both terms to the rank of the unreal and denies the possibility of knowledge. For he identifies this true reality with the act which makes knowledge possible and thus really suppresses the conditions of knowl- edge. The metaphysical result is a realism of action analogous to the realism of being which was conceived by Plotinus. Having pointed out that homo- geneity causes the antinomies, he exiles it and appeals to the continuous. But when compelled to introduce a principle of differentiation in order to make knowledge possible, he rejects the discontinuous only to call to his aid heterogeneity, which is (at least etymologically) not so antagonistic. Never- theless, the principle of differentiation, whatever its name, is the equivalent of discontinuity which he at first proposed to do without. The author has not attempted an exhaustive criticism of M. Bergson's philosophy. He has rather sought to show that any philosophy which wishes reality to be other than it is, must result in separating it from one of its conditioning elements. Thus separated, it is nil. HARVEY G. TOWNSEND. La metaphysiqgue de Hegel conside'ree d'un point de vue scientifique. FEDERICO ENRIQUEs. Rev. de. Met., XVIII, I, pp. 1-24. Enriques conceives metaphysics as a subjective representation which develops by antithesis alongside of the objective representation of scientific reality, and in this sense he regards metaphysics as an essential factor in scientific progress. To elucidate his view, he traces the conception of meta- physics in the philosophy of Hegel. The limitation of our schematic concepts, inadequate to represent reality, and their synthesis into ever more adequate concepts, characterize the general progress of science. The development of the implications of this idea that all is relative involves the development of the whole Hegelian philosophy. The speculative reason, in opposition to the intellect which operates in scientific constructions, is characterized precisely by the suppression of the process of abstraction and the rigid determination of objects on which all knowledge rests. Hegel conceives the associative progression which coordinates things in the notion as the affirmation of their unity, as the recognition of a quid commune. The dialectical progression</page><page sequence="8">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 687 virtually gives, in a glance, the whole infinite series of scientific progress. The author then discusses the technical elaboration of Hegel's dialectical method and the Absolute Idealism to which it leads. In regard to the religious implications of the method, and the relation of science to faith, Enriques points out that, just because science is virtually in conflict with faith, a philosophy which would be religion must include in itself science. The philos- ophy which would give a unitary view of life must contain in itself both the philosophy of nature and the philosophy of history. The writer indicates the inadequacies of Hegel's speculations in the philosophy of nature, and traces the notion of teleology in his philosophy of history, which he regards as defending the thesis: "The rational is real; the real is rational." Hegel's conception of society as an organic unity, and of the determinism which governs history, Enriques regards as being the foundation of an exact scientific notion of the matter. If the Hegelian method is freed from its extravagances, if the vanity of speculative knowledge in its opposition to science is recognized, if the Hegelian poem is reduced to its positive elements, it remains as the great encouraging faith in the value of ideas, which urges the will to progress. R. A. TSANOFF. Der idealistische Begriff des Subjekts. OSWALD WEIDENBACH. Kant-Studien, XV, I, pp. 152-i62. Empiricism and idealism are the two characteristic modes of interpreting Being in general. Taking its bearings from the strict laws of mathematics, idealism opposes the relativistic tendency which distinguished all empiricism and the uniformities of organic life with which it is mainly concerned. The idealistic insistence on the absoluteness of law ("fiat justitia pereat mundus") has tended to make empiricism the more popular of the two. Weidenbach proposes to discuss the difference between the two philosophical positions with respect to the Subject. Idealism advocates the claims of Being; empiricism, those of the Subject. Hence, for empiricism, probability and contingent association take the place of truth and law-conforming coherence. And in so far as we are concerned with Dasein, i. e., with Being as our Haben, empiricism is quite right. But Being itself, or the Idea as the totality of all possible phenomena, is reached only by overcoming all limits of finitude. The Idea is the presupposition of all Dasein, the condition of the possibility of all experience, and yet it is not an object of our world. It is experience that first makes multiplicity possible, by means of the singularities of phenomena: this is the only meaning of experience for idealism. But the standpoint of em- piricism is naturally that of singularity, and the notion of singularity or par- ticularity is what is commonly meant by the "Subject." Weidenbach dis- cusses in this connection the notion of personality; in conclusion he touches the subject on its religious side. The "Brother" bird and "Sister" sun of Francis of Assisi illustrate the conviction of the religious consciousness that in the essence of all Being there is an immanent unity pervading the apparent difference of the manifold.

Ar. f. G. Ph., XVI, 2, pp. I45- I83. Malebranche's inquiries into the mathematical and physical sciences first led him to his metaphysical speculations and formed the basis for them. Therefore the fundamentals on which his metaphysics rests are to be considered before the problems of metaphysics. Historically, these latter have been considered to the exclusion of his work concerning the fundamental and the methodological conceptions of science. Concerning truth and appearance he declares that one ought never to give entire consent except to propositions which appear so obviously true that one cannot reject them without feeling the secret reproaches of the reason. One should agree to the apparent when it signifies the copy of truth, but should not agree unconditionally until sub- jected to proof. Dogmatism as well as skepticism is to be avoided. Truth is unchangeable and eternal, the soul recognizes it only through a natural and necessary union with truth itself, that is, with God. Two kinds of truth are distinguished: the necessary, dependent on God's will, and the accidental, dependent on man. Among the former there are some unchangeable because of their nature and others because of the determination of God's will. All truths are nothing but relations, quantitative and qualitative. In every problem, one seeks only the knowledge of these relations, further divided into those of exact and incomplete cognition, to determine which, distinct ideas are necessary. Truths are real and intelligible relations of extension and completion, the former abstract, metaphysical truths; the latter unchangeable and necessary laws as well. The first are speculative, the second practical. In the inquiry for necessary relations lies the fundamental tendency of Male- branche's Idealism. Science is a system of judgments to be worked out from the source of consciousness itself. In its purest form it is mathematics which alone possesses changeless standards. Relation embraces not only relations between ideas but relations of relations, an infinite chain. Only unity and infinity are absolute. To recognize truth exactly, the relations must be recognized. Those of equality are known exactly but inequality requires a standard, a certain, determined part as a unity. Without the ideas of number and without a method of comparing them, that is, without arithmetic, it is impossible to advance in the knowledge of complex truths or of complex relations between quantities. The truths of number are the clearest; all other relations are recognized clearly only in so far as one can express them through these universal standards. Except by means of these we have no certain knowledge. In geometry the sensuous element enters, which does not aid in finding the relations. It only tells that something is present; it does not give the object. The figure with which the proof is concerned is that of pure thought, not of perception. The figures give the ideas their content, but the ideas explain and prove the truth of the science. The figure is correct in so far as it truly represents the idea, for the idea controls the figure. Geometry brings the relations of things to the mind's attention, but</page><page sequence="10">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 689 nature is concrete and it is always necessary to regard nature itself in order not to be led astray in mathematical calculations. The principles upon which calculations regarding nature are based are, after all, assumptions. Geometry begins with the simplest things in relation but its inadequacy lies in that it has no true means of reducing the ideas and the discovered relations. Algebra and analysis accomplish this. Algebra is defined as the science of the undetermined numbers. Analysis, the system of algebraic and arithmetical calculus, is, for Malebranche, the surest of all the sciences, the continuation of geometry, and thus too the universal science. In physics, Malebranche condemns the Scholastics as abstract and chimerical and considers Aristotle as the father of their philosophy. Regarding Aristotle he is wrong. The scholastic philosophy is abstract because the schoolmen were unable to give physical explanations of phenomena. To get from the scholastic to modern physics, a transitional step is necessary-the sense-qualities. These are subjective and by means of them we get our views of the physical world. For an explanation of this world, Malebranche is dependent upon Descartes. In biology, however, he advances beyond Descartes, recognizing that more than merely mechanical laws are necessary for organisms in which every part is both a means and an end. His fundamental conception of the development of the organism and of generations of organisms from the germ is later worked out in the Preformation Theory. CORRINNE STEPHENSON. The Pragmatism of Kant. A. C. MCGIFFERT. J. of Ph., Psy., and Sci. Meth., VII, 8, pp. 197-203. Considering Kant's emphasis on the doctrine of the postulates, it seems strange that pragmatists should disregard him. Though we cannot experi- ence supersensible realities, we can make them true by postulating them. We do not find them; we create them; and from a practical point of view, we are justified in acting as though they were real. Kant's emphasis upon the activity of the will in forming truth and the practical nature and practical test of the truth thus formed is genuinely pragmatic. The fundamental difference between Kant and the pragmatists is that the latter take the word experience in a broader sense. Kant too contends that the world is plastic and man gives it meaning and value. Phenomena are real, but reality is not simply what we find it, but what we make it. Unity is to be attained; it is not absolute, and refractory elements are to be overcome by the free, human will. God is one of many free, moral beings; to postulate Him, is to postulate will and power for the accomplishment of a certain definite purpose. Knowl- edge is impossible apart from experience. A priori forms and categories are given only in experience as its pre-conditions and the necessity which attaches to them is a necessity found in experience and valueless beyond it. As between the pragmatists of today and intellectualists of the type of Bradley or Royce, Kant belongs with the pragmatists.

Rauh, the psychologist, has been charged with impressionism, but this charge is less true of the content than of the form of his thought. In his early years he was an enthusiastic metaphysician and found in idealism the key to all philosophy. Liberty and determinism may both be moments of reality. Will must be manifested in action, and action is a part of the general tissue of phenomena. This view accords all to nature and mechanism and at the same time accepts liberty as more than provisional. At a time when evolution was less popular than now, Rauh began the application of it to the growth of human sensation. The essential unity of philosophy is to be attained by substituting for the notion of thought fixed by the contemplation of an eternal reality, that of thought which creates its own object following a self-imposed law. Rauh thought that feeling and emotion ought to find their place again in a moral system from which they had been banished by an arbitrary glorifica- tion of reason. For Kant the authority of reason seemed to consist in the universality of the propositions by which it expresses itself. Rauh shows that the rational character of a theoretical or practical certainty is independent of the extension that we attribute to its terms. In holding that laws of conduct cannot be deduced a priori from a theory of the world, Rauh rediscovers and at the same time transforms the Kantian doctrine of the autonomy of the practical reason. Moral certitude is decisive in the realm of action but does not tell us facts that we can learn from science. Of all classical thinkers, Pascal alone seized the immediate and special character of all primary truths. But we may ask: If in every order of thought immediate and special evidence is the criterion, what is the relation of the different types of certainty? This leads to the general problem of the nature of certainty. Rauh defines certitude by its genesis and shows that all truth, moral as well as intellectual, is dictated to thought by a self-imposed law. A priori truths are experimental certainties, capable of being achieved in time, but not to be made independent of their own proper development. Theory and practice can arise from the same activity, but one does not dominate the other. From the metaphysical interests of his earlier years, Rauh turned later to scientific psychology, although in doing so he had to overcome certain temperamental objections. He held, in contradiction to James, that the contents of mental life are not in a continuous flux, but show isolated states. There is room for both per- manence and change. Psychology should hold itself less to a literal imitation of natural science and develop a method suitable to its own material. Its end should be the discovery of relations of constant dependence between facts, whatever may be the qualitative differences of the facts. Therefore psycho- physical laws are possible. For even if mental states are not in themselves measurable, we may determine their presence or absence, their resemblance or difference. Psychology is justified in employing in at least part of its work the three great methods used in the analysis of nature-experimental, com- parative, and genetic. Two principal errors are to be avoided-that of forcing</page><page sequence="12">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 69i results into numerical or graphic form to the neglect of introspection, and that of concealing the impossibility of using the physical and biological methods, by a purely verbal confusion of these methods with others more simple and gross; psychology should limit itself to describing and relating. Fact for it has a value as fact and independent of its explanation. The use of the unconscious in psychological explanations has been looked upon as superstitious and metaphysical because it was confined to psychology. It is justified when the unconscious facts are seen to be organic. In common usage we do not deny a fact which is revealed only by its result. Rauh did not confine himself to any method. The multiplicity of explanations and methods seemed to result from the nature of things. The conscious man epitomizes nature, and therefore all types of law apply to him. HELEN M. CLARKE. Hasard ou liberte. E. BOUTROUX. Rev. de. Met., XVIII, 2, Pp. I37-I46. Science reduces the uniformities of nature to a few great laws derived from observation of facts. A fact has the character of contingency, and reason must ask: Does the concept of contingence bring back chance? Science eliminates chance a priori and by definition. But the complete reduction to quantitative terms which is the ideal of science does away with law and order by the substitution of a pure unity. In that case the given order of the uni- verse is itself chance. In the development of science the explanation of facts by human analogies gives place to explanation by facts of the same order. The latter method cannot be questioned as to its legitimacy, but it is not our only guide. We must refer to another authority, consciousness, which is defended against the charge of subjectivity by being developed, tested by tradition and guided by reason. The most original form of consciousness is that of existence and this cannot be detached from sensation. Conscious life is intelligence and intelligence is a demand for order. According to Aristotle, order is the rule imposed upon the free man, making him free and thus superior. It is the soul of evolution and the basis of the uniformity to which intelligence tends. Besides sensation and order, conscious life presents a third characteristic-that of perpetual novelty. The ego itself is a new creation every moment. It is from the conscious life that emanates the in- cessant flood of novelties which science presupposes but is not able to explain. The world, in its creation, is submitted to other laws than those of science- the laws of liberty-which are one with living intelligence. HELEN M. CLARKE. Post-Kantian Idealism and the Question of Moral Responsibility. J. W. SCOTT. Int. J. E., XX, 3, pp. 329-340. Idealistic thought of the early nineteenth century undertook the vindication of the spiritual rights of man, yet the idealism directly descended from it is accused of neglecting man's higher interests, especially religious and moral. The question arises: If the universe be what idealism allows, an unbroken</page><page sequence="13">692 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REbUE R. [VOL.

The ordinary man's cri- terion of freedom seems to be a possibility of choice. But if circumstances are exactly repeated, it is unthinkable that the same individual could choose differently. What then is the criterion which is used in determining what deserves praise or blame? A man is responsible for as much of an act as he does. But assuming scientific law, does any one ever really 'do' anything? Materialism would say no. To see where idealism differs is to see what its conception of a freedom consistent with natural law is. Idealism would hold that natural order is based on freedom. Kant showed that the laws of nature indicate the character of the mind. Their universal validity is proved by their source. They are the expression of the mind, because they are something which mind does. On this turns the whole idealistic conception of freedom. The free activity of mind is what makes the natural order possible. There is a difference of agent and product between the intelligent activity which is the source of the natural order and all action which falls within that order. Thus intelligent action is free, while natural changes are not. Human activity is what is free. The human being is the author of what issues from him even though it came from the world; for he is identified with the world. The sum of conditions which have made him what he is, is responsible for all his deeds, but not as so many conditions. They gather themselves up into a person before they do anything, and that person is the I. CORRINNE STEPHENSON. Can Pragmatism Furnish a Philosophical Basis for Theology? 0. C. MACIN- TOSH. Harvard Theol. Rev., III, I, Pp. I25-I35. In order to formulate an intelligent answer to this question, it is necessary first to offer some solution to the much-mooted problem, "What is pragma- tism?" Although asserting neither that all true judgments are useful, nor that all useful judgments are true, pragmatism merely demands that, in any crisis in which a judgment is necessitated, the most promising suggestion be taken as a working hypothesis and its truth tested by the way it works. The neces- sary-that is, what man really finds needful to believe in order to live as he ought-is true. Far from the welfare of the physical organism being the sole criterion, however, the physical life must be regarded as chiefly an instru- ment in the promotion of conscious life in its spiritual aspects. Furthermore, it is in social utility and necessity, as opposed to the merely individual, that truth is discovered. Religious knowledge must be integrated with other knowledge in the final philosophy. It seems fair to assume that, according to pragmatic principles, there is existential truth in our necessary mode of thinking of reality beyond experience as if it were immediately present to some experiencing subject. Pragmatic ontology, if a consistent system is sought for, must accept a spiritualistic conception of reality including but transcending all human experience. GEORGE T.

This article is the first of a series of six on the general subject of duty. Ac- cording to M. Moisant, duty is the subject both of the particular inquiries of applied ethics and of general or fundamental ethical questions. Ignoring the arguments of those who merely wish to destroy the idea of duty, the present discussion is concerned with the theory that the notion of duty may be re- placed by other less authoritative motives toward well-doing. The medieval Christian theory of duty based it upon the divine will. Kant bases duty rather upon the autonomy of the individual human reason. Determinist science, denying liberty, responsibility, and immortality, wishes to rid itself of all theological and metaphysical entanglements. Duty, holds Herbert Spencer, is to be replaced by altruism. Others suggest as substitutes the aesthetic charm of virtue, or the very love of the risk that is run in not knowing whether or not virtue will ultimately receive its reward. To the question as to whether the idea of duty is a superstition, M. Moisant gives a negative reply, supporting his position by appealing to contemporary secular writers, to contemporary morals, and to the simple logic of language. On the last point it is shown that the proposed optatives or persuasives do not replace an imperative. It is legitimate to question the authority of duty but a mis- take to try to replace it by substitutes instead of seeking its foundation. J. R. TUTTLE.</page></plain_text>
