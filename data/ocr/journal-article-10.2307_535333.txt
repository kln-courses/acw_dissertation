<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLOWN'S FUNCTION By LUCILE HOERR CHARLES Clowning is an exceedingly widespread phenomenon, appearing in all parts of the globe, apparently from very early times to the present, and giving every indication of continuing vigorously into the future. What are the con- stants and variables of clowning? What has the stage buffoon of the Chinese in common with the court fool of the Middle Ages in Europe; and with the stage fool in Elizabethan England, magnificently represented in Falstaff; and with the Badin in France, origin of our term badinage; and with the Spanish Bobo or Booby? How does the Narr and Hanswurst in Germany differ from the comic Vidusaka, stock character of the Hindu drama; or from the early Greek clowns depicted on Corinthian vases; or from the ancient Egyptian god Typhon, probably a deified clown, with his heavy, coarse face and protrusive tongue? What is the essential significance of Charlie Chaplin's spring dance amid the precision, power machinery of the factory, in the movie "Modern Times;" why does the audience howl with laughter when the factory worker suddenly runs amuck, pulls levers here and punches buttons there, causing jams, uproar, and explosions, while he skips lightly pirouetting over belts, pulleys and wheels until at last he flees, a fugitive from the police? What was the secret of Will Rogers' gifted fooling, enabling him during World War I, frequently with President Woodrow Wilson and other officials in the audience, to make acute political remarks which, in a more serious speaker, might easily have caused serious offense? Why was Grock ridiculous, with his slow, simple-minded business of trying to seat himself in a huge chair, and then in a tiny chair? The subject of clowning has invited the study and thought of many theatre historians and essayists, including especially for example, Willson Disher, whose pithy and suggestive "Clowns and Pantomimes"' brings together much unusual material; and Hermann Reich, whose monumental "Der Mimus"2 is a detailed history remarkably retaining zest and a sense of gaiety appropriate to the subject. On less grand a scale, W. A. Clouston,3 Enid Welsford,4 and Barbara Swain5 present thoughtful, comprehensive contributions; while specific areas in the history of clowns have received noteworthy treatment by Bruestle;" Haile;7 Busby;8 Gaedick;9 and numerous others.

Many anthropologists discuss clowns in their writings. For example, Ridge- way" discusses the origin of comedy in early Greece and Sicily; Bunzel offers much material on Zuni clowns;12 and Simmons"3 has secured unusual, first- hand reports of Hopi clowning. Julian Steward presents a comprehensive description of buffoons of the American Indian ;4" and J. J. Honigman proffers a brief interpretation of ritual clowns.15 A great number of anthropologists describe clowns in field reports. To a moderate extent psychologists have been interested in the general subject of humor and by implication in the function of clowns. Freud"6 analyzes humor with emphasis upon regression to childish pleasures. Maier"7 has advanced an analysis illustrating the Gestalt point of view; and Pidding- ton18 usefully summarizes various theories of humor from Plato on, and ad- vances his own, based upon the formula that the ludicrous is always anti- social and serves as compensation for conscious attitudes that are socially correct. Believing that comparative study of primitive clowns illuminates the general problem of the clown's function, the present writer herewith briefly summarizes a study based upon the Cross-Cultural Survey19 of the Institute of Human Relations, Yale University; and formulates a commentary in the light of the writer's understanding of analytical (Jungian) psychology, and years of practical experience in the professional and amateur theatre. Data on 136 representative, primitive cultures were available in the Cross-Cultural Survey. The reports on eighty cultures were found to contain no material on clowns, whereas the reports on fifty-six cultures contain relevant material. Elaborate clowning occurs in seventeen cultures, considerable clowning in twenty-three, and a small amount in sixteen cultures. Distribution of clown- ing among primitives appears to be fairly even, with Asia, Africa, Oceania, and North and South America all offering examples of high development; although these findings are very tentatively advanced, and as incidental to the main purpose of the investigation. 11 William Ridgeway, Dramas and Dramatic Dances of Non-European Races in Special Ref- erence to the Origin of Greek Tragedy; with an appendix on the origin of Greek comedy (New York, 1916). 12 Cf. especially R.

Even Russian officials who are present at these dances may be imitated with perfect license.20 The Ainu produce rain by a clown dog.21 Among the Chukchee, a favorite comic dance is called "The Boneless One," and is accompanied by violent jerking motions of the head and arms to pretend that the dancers have no bones at all.22 Joking is very popular among the Kurds, and every chief has a buffoon who is obliged to keep the company mirthful.23 The Hill-Marias are noted for lightheartedness, and for their willingness to burlesque themselves. A village headman, for instance, makes the entire camp roar with laughter over an imitation of his first, vain efforts to drive a pair of bullocks which pulled him wildly hither and thither.24 The Yakut derive amusement from the antics of persons suffering from emirak, a nervous disease of the North, which is manifested in an inclination to imitate loud or sudden noises and actions.25 "This disease sometimes takes such a form that the patients comply with the most absurd commands of anybody, and often become the puppets of naughty street arabs."28 During the devil-dances held in the summer at each lamasery among the Mongols, a gray-haired old man usually comes out at some point in the festivi- ties and, with many amusing capers, shoots off fire crackers, whilst the people shout with laughter.27 The Balinese puppet theatre, a highly developed in- stitution, features clowns who improvise freely. The clown Twalen is a ponderous black monster, with a pot-belly, of a great wit, and a magic air about him .... His rival, the wild-eyed, stiff-mustachioed red monster D6lam, with his little legs and enormous mouth, is a good match for him, and the constant fighting of the two creatures keeps the observers in hysterics.28 Many Buka children are excellent mimics, an accomplishment which is much appreciated by their audience, both children and adults. After the an- nual visit of inspection of the governor, the children re-enact the entire oc- casion, solemnly burlesquing the parade of villagers, and the slow formality of the governor; until dignity finally collapses in a mad scramble for bits of stick and pigs' teeth representing the governor's customary largess of tobacco and sweets.29 A somewhat similar bit of fooling is recorded among the Maori, where a line 20 A.

The Imigi, played by young men, pretend to run away and sometimes to attack the Spirits; or they make obscene gestures at women; all of which is considered vastly amusing by the onlookers.31 If men should quarrel during one of the ceremonies of the Murngin, a clown steps forth and begins to eat and fight absurdly, causing all to laugh, and creating an atmosphere in which no angry deeds can be committed. This clowning is a deliberate technique for preventing feuds.32 An Orokaiva clown is usually a man of character and social importance. His conventional costume is made of an extremely rough and ragged kind of bark cloth, and it covers him like a hooded cloak. By immersion in swamp mud it is dyed to an evil grey-black, and where it leaves his limbs exposed the actor may apply charcoal. Over his eyes, he wears a pair of half coco-nut shells, like huge goggles, which are pierced so that he may see through them .... His makeup is rendered more terrible or absurd by such things as boars' tusks for teeth and fringes of cassowary feathers for whiskers . . and if he is a male he wears very ostentatiously an imitation penis."a The costume of the clown in a Pukapukan play is similarly bizarre. The entire body is plastered with grey mud; and the actor is naked except for loin cloth, a turban of old fishing net, and weird mustaches of coconut husk fibre.34 The Tasmanians have gifted fools who are especially clever at lampooning individuals;35 and in Tonga, unofficial jesters devote themselves to amusing the chiefs. One Tongan jester is reported to have had himself trussed up like a pig and taken to a feast, on one hilarious occasion."3 In North America, a number of clown performances are recorded among the Creeks. The leader in a dance, for example, often improvises witticisms which are echoed and enlarged upon by a chorus. These episodes are not only in- tended for entertainment, but are connected also with Creek religious beliefs concerning procreation."3 A Maricopa clown wears a mask; dances violently, all by himself; and uses inverted speech, causing great merriment.38 The Omaha clown is described as a scapegoat who during the annual buffalo hunt assumes with a comical air 30 Edward Tregear, The Maori Race (Wanganui, 1905) 57. 31 Gunnar Landtman, The Kiwai Papuans of British New Guinea (London, 1927) 394. 32 W.

The clown is a significant political figure, for if he severely criticizes the chief, a new chief is chosen.40 Clowning appears among the Yurok, especially toward the end of the ceremonies associated with the building of the salmon dams, and with the salmon runs which are a climax also in the economic life of the people. The clowning includes an illicit elopement, the capsizing of a canoe, and capture of the bold villain of the piece amid jokes, mockery and invective.41 The Tupinamba of South America enjoy mass clowning. Their young bachelors dress up and dance from house to house all night long, singing and creating ridiculous pantomime.42 A grievance-clown, very similar to the early Greek lampooners, exists among the Witotos. While a dance is in progress, a man with a grievance, having donned an enormous, foolish hat so as to be sure of gaining attention, stations himself conspicuously and proceeds to air his complaint. The fol- lowing recitation is typical: There came a man this morning to our lodge- A man who took cassava from my woman. Cassava she gave him in exchange for two pines, For two pines she gave him much cassava. But where are the pines? Where are the pines he promised? Was this man a thief? This man who took cassava from my woman? Or the complaint may run, I came in with meat; The hungry man took my meat, But promised me bread, He gave me no bread, And my stomach is empty. The chief takes notice of the grievance, which will be adjusted, perhaps at the next tobacco palaver.43 The Ashanti of Africa are very fond of story-telling evenings, during which actors give lively impersonations. The stories usually contain jocular passages upon otherwise sacred matters, e.g. the sky-god, spirit ancestors, the chiefs, and sexual taboos. No one is permitted to take offense.44 With the Azande, on 39 Alice C. Fletcher, and Francis LaFlesche, The Omaha Tribe (Bureau of American Ethnology, Twenty-seventh Annual Report.

One of the most impres- sive is the dramatizing of mocking songs, accusing a misbehaving child, for example, of stealing milk or maize. The offense is gradually revealed in an im- promptu sketch with skillful climax. The misery of the culprit is intense, and is supposed to be salutary.4" The Tiv have highly developed beast epics, the animal characters of which, including Brer Rabbit, are often wits and rogues similar to clowns. The anthropomorphic nature of these animals is revealed in dramatic story- telling.47 The Wolof, who are also fond of fables, have in addition jesters or clowns, called griots. These griots are attached traditionally to certain fami- lies. They have unlimited critical license, and their only duty is to be droll.48 Among the most spectacular manifestations of clowns are the clown societies, which in some cultures appear as stable institutionalizations of the clown function. These societies form a climax of clown activity, and possibly also indicate a supreme psychological need. The clown societies of the various Pueblo Indians of North America are among the most highly organized.49 Among the Zuni, for example, organized groups of clowns take part in all katcina dances, and delight the beholders with their silly and obscene wit. The Koyemci, a society of masked clowns, are greatly feared for their super- natural powers; and the N6we-kwe clown society are highly regarded for their ability as medicine men, and for love magic.-" The relationship of the clowns to the fertility of man, beast and field, is evident in their games, many of which are plainly sexual. The Zuni clowns perform in many extraordinary ways; for example, Each man endeavors to excel his fellows in buffoonery and in eating repulsive things, such as bits of old blanket or splinters of wood. They bite off the heads of living mice and chew them, tear dogs limb from limb, eat the intestines and fight over the liver like hungry wolves. . . . The one who swallows the largest amount of filth with the greatest gusto is most commended by the fraternity and onlookers. A large bowl of urine is handed by a K6yemshi, who receives it from a woman on the housetop, to a man of the fraternity, who, after drinking a portion, pours the remainder over himself by turning the bowl over his head. Women run to the edge of the roof and empty bowls of urine over the Newekwe and K6yemshi.5s 45 P. M. Larken, An Account of the Zande (Sudan Notes and Records 9-Io: 85-134, 1926- 27) 86. 46 O. F.

The clowns were now upon their mettle .... Out of doors . .. they always made it a point of honor to eat the excrement of men and dogs.52 The elaborate organization, strict ritual combined with wildest improvisa- tion, and the intricate symbolism of the costumes and properties, are de- scribed in great detail by numerous writers and can be only barely suggested here. "The Koyemci occupy so important a place in the life and thought of the people that no paper about the pueblos fails to mention them.""3 Let us take one more example from the pueblos' clown activities, a play of the Taos fndians, presented informally by the Chifonetti or Delight Makers, and so well described by Bailey that the record is quoted here at length. In preparation, a forty-foot pole had been brought from the mountains and set up in the plaza between the two pueblos, and at our arrival a picturesque group of blanketed figures in orange, red, and green, stood at the foot of the pole looking up at an Indian in a red shirt, who was seated on a cross-bar near the top arranging the prizes for which the Chifonetti were to climb the pole-a string of watermelons, a great bag of bread with a long red streamer dangling from it, and the whole carcass of a sheep in its wool. The Chifonetti, with bodies and limbs fantastically banded with black and white, their faces, with their noses as centers, blackened in radiating lines or concentric circles, and their ears decorated with bristling bunches of corn husk, made a bizarre group. At first they went about playing pranks on the people, their fun being taken in great good part by all except one old woman, accidentally hit by a flying apple, who scolded them roundly, much to the amusement of the crowd. When tired of making sport of the onlookers, one of the Delight Makers walked up under the pole on which the sheep was hanging and made sheep tracks with his fingers in the dust. Then the acting began. Another of the band strolled by, and, discovering sheep tracks, began trailing the animal eagerly, looking everywhere until, glancing up, the dangling sheep caught his eye. Then with tiny straw bows and arrows, the actors began shooting at the sheep with great glee and horseplay. Afterwards, they went through a long performance pretending to climb the pole. When the first man slipped down, they put earth on the shaft, and when he had climbed part way up, the others dropped on all fours, acting the part of furious bulls, pawing, throwing up the earth, and bellowing to discourage the climber's descent. After this they went for a short ladder and one of the group, climbing it, raised his hands in mock dramatic manner toward the sheep and melons beyond his reach. All sorts of clownish play and a running fire of jokes followed, but finally a long ladder was brought and when a chain of men had reached the upper rungs of this and then mounted on each other's shoulders, the top man climbed a few feet and successfully reached the cross bars." For sheer silliness, simplicity, color, and charm, a more appealing little play can hardly be imagined. 52 John G.

Indeed, so widespread is the phenomenon that one feels justified in inquiring what aspect may exist in cultures where it is not re- corded; whether it may not have escaped the notice of some observers? Meanwhile, the following conclusions suggest themselves regarding the clown function: Apparently a clown is concerned always with something which is not quite proper; with something embarrassing, astonishing, shocking, but not too much so. This fact appears to be a constant at all times and in all places. A clown holds the licentious thing in his hands, psychologically speaking; he is objective at the same time that he has a most intimate and thoroughgoing relationship with the tabooed thing. He goes through a ritual of impersonation as if he were the outrageous thing itself or its personification; yet at the same time he knows, his audience knows, and both he and his audience know that the other knows, that he is not that thing. Very frequently he is one of the most honorable persons in the community. He is playing with fire; but he is not the fire. The moment he identifies himself with the fire he is no longer funny; that fine, delightful sense of balance and mastery is lost, and the clown becomes pathetic, ineffective, disgusting. What the successful clown does, with his impersonation, is so exquisitely balanced and withal so dynamic an experience, that he is indeed a delight- maker, as Pueblo Indians call him. We watch him, following his motions breathlessly while he builds through skillful suspense to a surprise climax. We lend him our active, imaginative attention: our hearts beat faster if he runs, we feel a sympathetic shock if he falls. We lend him our own powers; to a large extent we identify ourselves with him; we are going through the same experience imaginatively which he concretizes before our eyes. He is a priest, therefore, performing a rite both in his own and in our behalf. And what is this rite? It is the locating, naming, bringing to a head, and expressing of a psychological element which has been causing trouble in the unconscious; a renegade element, which for the sake of self-integration and further progress in personal living should be brought up to consciousness, released, to a certain extent experienced and consciously related to, and so assimilated into the personality of the beholder.6s Laughter is one of the purest and most spontaneous expressions of the sud- den happiness of release, of rebirth into consciousness and acceptance of an element needed for personal balance and progress. In his race-long effort to achieve his full stature, to become more conscious, to come to grips with his own real potentialities, mankind frequently has be- come too absorbed in fine and high flights of intellect and power, and has neg- lected the humdrum, humble, everyday, earthy side of life. Such neglect is true of very primitive man as well as of so-called civilized man. He pushes too hard in one direction or another. Yet this is good; for by such salient efforts, progress is made. And always, when he tends to go too far from his base, if 66 Cf. C. G. Jung, Psychological Types (New York, 1933) 563 ff.</page><page sequence="9">The Clown's Function 33 there is health in him the neglected functions will stir in his unconscious, just below the surface of consciousness; he is ready to feel tickled at those places; and when the gifted clown comes along and intuitively seizes upon these hidden elements in his audience and bodies them forth in dramatic play, his audience is held, led, released, and delighted. Once more, life is served. All actors perform a similar function; the clown's function is different be- cause he so fully retains his own personality at the same time that he acts out the outrageous, neglected, tabooed, proscribed element. He is himself; com- menting in word and pantomime good-naturedly and cleverly upon the very thing he is presenting; and everybody knows he is himself. Furthermore, he concentrates upon evoking the explosive pleasure in his audience which expresses itself in laughter. A skillful clown may at times play also upon the heartstrings of his observers and make them cry, or nearly cry; but he does so, in order to intensify through contrast the bright happiness of subsequent laughter. If he does not so subordinate the pathos to humor, then he is no longer a clown-comedian, but a tragedian, who uses his effects the other way around-also a releasing, ritual experience; but different; not funny. So we see that the earthy, neglected element in man must be restored to him; and this is the function of the clown, who not merely concentrates upon mudpies, or custard pies, but also cleverly comments upon the distance be- tween the acultural element and the prevailing, conscious custom; thus creat- ing a bridge from the one to the other through his own art and personality and his awareness of incongruity. The clown does everything exaggeratedly, both in order to symbolize the exaggerated size and quality characteristic of an element which is causing unconscious conflict; and also the better to emphasize and to hold up for clear understanding. These two functions amount in the end to the same thing, namely, that the clown performs an extraordinarily alive and immediate ritual of induction into the consciousness of his audience, of relatively neg- lected elements in the life of the individuals in the community. Earthiness, poverty, renegade irresponsibility, irreverence and license of all sorts-these are the constant elements in clowning. We may therefore expect Charlie Chaplin's spring dance in the factory to please an audience in the power age; Grock's slow motion to be amusing in a culture charac- terized by high speed; and his business with a simple chair to fill a need in folk surrounded by new, complicated machinery. The clown's appearance, actions, words all are expressive of his purpose. The dirty, bizarre, mud makeup is ap- parently a very widespread if not universal symbol. Our American circus clowns retain it as stylized white greasepaint looking like plaster; the Pueblo Indians cake themselves in mud from heat to foot; the Zuni even call one of their clown societies the Mudheads. Furthermore, and this fact is very significant, the mud used in Zuni comes from a Sacred Lake; or from the footprints of townspeople, a powerful love- charm. This is significant because it shows the close relation betweeen the profane and the sacred; shows the vitalizing, religious value of bringing a neglected element back into the conscious life of the people; demonstrates</page><page sequence="10">34 Journal of American Folklore the close kinship of Mudhead and Godhead. Anything which so much needs to be done, in order that life may be fully lived, becomes sacred in character. The devil is a necessary and most valuable god. Here then is the reason for the clown's many names and guises and close psychological cousins. He is Devil and Vice, as well as Demon, Goblin, and Knave. He merges often into a Churl, Boor, Rustic, Dupe, Dolt, Booby, Simpleton, Noodle, or Nut. He may function as a Fool, Jester, Buffoon, Comic; or Harlequin or Pierrot with a more romantic touch. He may be a Parasite, Scape-goat, Old Man or Old Woman; or an animal; or he may be the "Fool of Nature," and so complete the cycle back again to the Holy Grail and man's perennial quest. I see no reason for sharp lines of classification: humorous story, folktale, literature, joking relationship, cartoon, clown, all stem from the same basic human need; and the clown ritual function moves among these many forms with their infinite number of variations, taking shape and impetus from particular human beings, in a particular culture, with their particular expression of the universal need. Accordingly, the nature of a people or an individual will correlate with the nature of their humor and their clowns. What causes the Pukapukans to shriek with laughter may leave the European observer cold; or possibly may cause him also to shriek with laughter for the same or for a different reason. The patients of a mental hospital may laugh at things which do not amuse the doctors at all. But each to his own need. Granting the personal pattern, humor meets the same need still; and the clown serves everywhere as a high priest of the psychological ritual re-inducting the earthy, neglected functions.
