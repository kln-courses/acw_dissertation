We could then still conceive of someday metaphysical conception of being: that is, a separation developing an "anthropology of art" that would also be a of "matter" from logos. Nietzsche saw this process—in true "art of anthropology"—not in the rhetorical sense of which Greek consciousness would have "freed" itself an ars anthropologica, but, with imagination and rigor, in of its "early-Semitic" elements—as a transition away the more problematic and elusive one of anthropology as from forms of "impure thought" (a qualification he art. In so doing, we might be able to rekindle in the study borrowed from Eugen Dühring's Der Wert des Lebens of objects a form of that adaequatio rei et intellectus that [1865]). But it would seem that some of those very remains at the core of our gnoseological tradition, and to components are not unrelated to those from which the at least delay the (perhaps inevitable) disappearance of post-Mosaic Hebrew tradition also sought to "free" "languages of difference," in a world disguising pervasive itself (possibly at about the same time, if not earlier); uniformity under cover of proliferating confrontations. in this case, however, it did so in favor of the aniconic record of the Word of God—a sort of proto-historicizing * logos, which became The Book. The Book, too, is of course a thing endowed with "materiality." But it must Nietzsche insisted on the intrinsic "syncretism" of be said, in the comparative perspective chosen here, Greek archaic religion—in mythology and in cult. He that the materiality of theTorah is paradoxical and wasn't the first to do so but he did so systematically (in contradictory, because it is based on the immateriality his last Basel courses in the academic years 1875-1876 of the Word—the very one which Plato evokes (in one and 1876-1877).1 The Semitic components, Phoenician of his Letters) as (original) phone. And so, on the one and other, that he (and other philologists) brought hand we would have an ur-Semitic materialism, which into evidence appear irrefutable. But it is as though in the Middle East would "dematerialize" into Hebrew in Greece's "victory" over the Persian East, and in its (and later Islamic) iconoclasm, while on the other simultaneous transition to what we call the "classical," the "classical" physis/logos dialectic was introduced, Greek civilization had gradually "decanted" and a sort of re-materialization/conceptualization of the "distilled" its own origins by inventing a new kind of question of being, which would eventually nourish the cult—one of celebration, and of the representation of Western notion of the Incarnation and the dialectics the divine (and thus also of the human). As it did so, of the material/immaterial (as well as that of the personal/impersonal). In the Christian Middle Ages this tension brings about a new explosion/liberation of 1. F.

In the late medieval and early modern cult the separation of the material from its perception coincides with that between those who are allowed to handle it and those who are not. Intermediaries manage the distance that converts the object into an image, and so, conversely, the image calls for mediation (and distance, as in that of the Annunciation). The archaic fetish, on the contrary, is not an "image" to anyone handling it and acting through it—so that we might call it materia naturata. But it transmutes into an image for anyone asking that it be acted upon on their behalf: as Duchamp saw, it is intention that generates the "image." Something at least partially analogous also holds for the museum object that curators handle and present to their public. In the process, the object loses materiality and acquires imaginality: it becomes, that is, universal in a new universe of forms. It acquires a global character, in the sense that its range becomes coextensive with the world of all preserved images. Yet, despite the neutrality of these, there will also always be a need to return to the objectum itself—and to the res in question. The object, now reclassified, ordered, grouped according to different categories—historical, stylistic, technological, etc.—remains all the same strongly isolated in its new condition; but like other objects in the same condition it has in fact acquired a number, which, in spite of its "abstract" nature, aims to be unique and univocal. Once again, we have that ambiguity and "oscillation," in the museum context, between the abstractness—and so "non-materiality"—of the object and its irreducible concreteness.3 For Christianity, after two thousand years, it is still the Word that brings about the Incarnation, just as it transforms (or should we say transubstantiates?) the host 2. G. Agamben, "Le cose Stesse" [1984], in La Potenza del Pensiero (Vicenza, 2005). 3. The nature of this relationship between the "material," or the concrete, and its "image" has been one of the main implicit themes running through the history of this journal. (the bread and wine) into the Corpus Christi, which is also an image of ecclesia, the collective body of the faithful. In the transition from the bread and wine to the host, one image of materiality, or rather two, are lost in favor of a third, more abstract, one. Christ asks his disciples to remember him with a "communion" of bread and wine when they gather again, but only after his death—that is, when his flesh-and-blood presence, ostensibly, will no longer be at hand. It will be the "memory" of a presence, and an in-corporation (ingestion) of it, but by means of an interposed physical substance. The bread and wine do not resemble the body of Christ—they are analogous (allegorical) elements, but their materiality is, so to speak, formless. The host is more abstract, as a substance, than bread and wine, but has form—that is, it is more of an image. It is to this "abstract" form, solar in shape (there are square coins but not, to my knowledge, square hosts), that the Word confers the power of consubstantiality. The Word says "the body and blood of Christ" to the host and of the host, and by saying so (again, Plato's phonè) activates its transmutation (once more, logos and physis). Yet the words do not say, explicitly, "this is Jesus you are going to eat." (I was always struck, as a practicing Catholic adolescent, by the recommendation not to chew the Holy Host—that it should be "absorbed" as if through some sort of osmosis, more like a homeopathic remedy than food.) But these words also refer to the story of the circumstantial event of that original transmutation. We then have two Words: the one that recounts and the one that activates. Only the second stands for the (repeated, that is, ritualized) Word-of-Christ (and Christ-as-Logos). The story is like a framing of this original Word. The host itself is not reproduced: It is both one and infinite. What can be and is reproduced is the image of the host, which stands for that of the Body of Christ (as in the representations of St. Gregory's Mass). In the host, the materiality of the Body of Christ is at the same time affirmed and negated (or transcended). Once more, this oscillation between the material and the immaterial in the Eucharistie sacrifice (the "mystery" of any sacrificial transmutation) is not without certain at least formal analogies to that which characterizes the transmutation of the cult object into a "work of art"—and, conversely, of the work of art into an aesthetic cult object. In the offering (Qurbana, in the ancient Syrian tradition) of the host, it is the dead materiality of the body as votive object that is (trans-)substantiated as "sacrifice," the gage for a new, ever-reenacted Covenant. In other words, it is re-formed in a fragmented, "abstracted," and then communally shared (hence</page><page sequence="4">RES 65/66 2014/2015 W;.?

Thus the host is one more instance—if a "sublimated" one—in which the dead body, as the first (or original) fetish, is struck by taboo, leading to its trans-figuration into images we must avert our gaze from (that is, protect ourselves from, as at the raising of the host at Mass), but which can in turn "look at" and protect us. Seeing the dead body is seeing the invisible; somewhat like Robert Musil's "invisible" monument, it is an invisible that in turn looks back onto the visible—like those medieval angels I began with. But it is also the image of the Invisible (an image, and hence perforce visible) "looking" at the image of the visible. When "visible/invisible" angels finally disappear from Western art we approach the conception of Klee's disquieting, post-World War I Angelus Novus of 1920,4 (fig. 2) regarding whose gaze we may recall Benjamin's reading: "This storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress."5 But what especially interests me here is the fact that Klee's angel, in its "novelty," stares in our direction—that is, outside of the picture and no longer as part of some trans-figured reality within it. Here, it is the artist who sees all through the image, like a "new shaman," and pictures it: When the subject becomes image, the image in turn becomes object, and opus. We can speak of "matter" as of the subject (res) of a discourse, or a dictum—as in Ennius's (somewhat "wishful") Moribus antiquis res stat Romana virisque, which adorns the proscenium of the theatre-hall of the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America, at Columbia University, where RES's fifteenth and thirty third anniversaries were celebrated. And the thing— res—is also "what is being discussed," or debated, in between possibly contrasting takes. But "matter" is also the chemical substance of which a thing is made, its physicality, so that "material culture" is generally used to refer to the ensemble of the objects we use. Concretely, they can either be things we make (products) or any sort of "found objects": both can 4.

Zohn (New York, 2007), p. 258. "Progress" is, of course, both the banner and bane of the Aufklärung. become objects of consumption. In its already long history "culture" has shifted increasingly from the objet trouvé toward the product:, which in turn has fueled the market. But then an inflation of products (and of their markets) has brought the objet trouvé back into the limelight, in and out of the flea market: The product separated from its maker (which can either be "nature," or a machine) becomes a thing-of-the-thing (rei-res)—so that almost anything becomes as if found, separate from its origin. The study and care of (so-called) material culture must lead it back to the immateriality of thought from which, obscurely, it took origin—so that the objet trouvé might once again become an objet produit, and come alive again. The "archaic object" is no different from any other object that springs from productive thought: Its origin is just as obscure, and like any other object it becomes an objet trouvé (or a lost one) as soon as it is separated from its source. Not infrequently, bloody sacrifice, or "offering," to visible/invisible entities is associated with this "obscure" origin, as a token of its efficacy: But is it really a do ut des—an exchange—or more like a substitution (or replacement)? In basically homeostatic conceptions of the cosmos something must be "put back" for everything that is "taken away," but there is not necessarily any rigid boundary between different "states," or conditions, of being. At some point and in certain places, in the development of our (now almost "global") consciousness, we started to objectify "things." It was at this juncture that what we call matter was born, and, though objects are never truly alive, their animation was posited (and mediatically enacted), and they were even made to talk. Pinocchio is the talking object—and, characteristically, the compulsive liar—par excellence. The inert wood of his nose grows (as if alive) every time he tells a lie—as if his lies belied his materially inert nature. His wooden feet, however, do not grow back after they catch fire while he "sleeps": It is because they are inert that they must promptly be carved anew by his maker, the carpenter Geppetto (a diminutive of Joseph, the name of Christ's "father"). It/he is then a live object—an absurdity—just as Pinocchio's "death" is an impossible one, because he is made of wood and so cannot die (nor be "born again"). In the final version of the story, Pinocchio is resuscitated through a radical transformation of substance, or matter: wood becomes flesh. So, first Pinocchio acquired the word (verbum), then caro factum est (it became a he). In an eerily Christlike way, in acquiring human-like flesh,</page><page sequence="6">10 RES 65/66 2014/2015 the object-Pinocchio (which in its original state could "obscure" origin.

Among many, too John Hay, Joseph Koerner, and Sarah Brett-Smith) further numerous to be listed here, I would like to at least contributed to this shift and growth.

In sum, the contribution of an ever-wider circle of imaginative and hard-working colleagues—as guest coeditors of special issues, specialist reviewers, and contributors of stimulating editorials—has been essential to RES's continued and growing vitality over the years, and to its capacity to renew itself, to the point that it can be said that they actually are the journal. Some of them may take on an even more prominent editorial role as RES moves beyond the direct responsibility of its founders and original associates. Outreach While the "novelty" of RES was soon recognized and appreciated by many readers in a variety of areas and fields, it was difficult for some time to establish the journal as a "central" presence in the academic study of "art." My insistence, for many years, that we avoid thematic issues and stick with the original challenge of providing variety, heterogeneity, and juxtaposition, certainly did not help the diffusion of the periodical. Even today, when multidisciplinary pieties seem to have become everybody's banner, the acceptance of the juxtaposition of diverse scholarly and speculative endeavors remains a problem for the circulation of the journal, despite the keen attention that our now frequent thematic issues have received. Specialized libraries and research institutions, pressed to make hard choices in the allocation of their limited funds, all too often have tended to act as if RES, despite its high scholarly standing, might belong more fittingly "in that other library." Time-pressed scholars, on the other hand—with the exception of those who have a truly broad scholarly curiosity and a penchant for comparative studies (and some measure of eclecticism)—may have felt, at times, that the occasional important single contribution (or even special whole issue) in their main area of interest did not justify a subscription. While every single volume of RES has always been like a book, because of its academic-museum publication setting it was always hard to find ways to easily make single current and past issues available in bookstores or similar outlets. This difficulty persisted despite its attractiveness as an "aesthetic object" in itself, which has enhanced its popularity with artists, including, first of all, Dan Flavin, whose basic design for the journal, as executed by the Peabody's designer at the time, Richard Bartlett, I have followed to this day, but also CyTwombly, Donald Judd, Brice Marden, Francesco Clemente, Enzo Cucchi, Saint Clair Cemin, Ray Smith, Mel Bochner, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Claudio Parmiggiani, and others. Cambridge University Press acted as its worldwide distributor for about ten years, but for most of the rest of the time, the Peabody Museum's publications office handled the task as best it could. In recent years Harvard University Press valiantly took over that role, despite the fact that they do not distribute journals per se, so that RES has been offered as a special "yearbook" in their general catalogue.6 New options and possibilities are currently being explored. Support Harvard University, like most academic institutions, is generally not inclined to provide funding for "special projects"; rather, it uses new ventures to attract new resources. The case of RES is no exception. Outside financial support for the journal has been necessary throughout its history. Small private foundations and individuals with whom I had close connections generously helped for the first few years. Then, the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities (now the Getty Research Institute)—thanks to the suggestion of the architect and scholar Massimo Scolari and the enthusiastic interest of Kurt Forster, its director at the time—provided principal funding and became copublisher of RES for six years (1990-1996). More recently, the Fanny and Leo Koerner Charitable Trust (no longer extant) ensured most of our funding for ten years (with the addition of small contributions by the 6. The Peabody Museum Press has carefully overseen the final production and printing of RES all these years, often under difficult conditions, under different stewardship. Donna Dickerson has been there from the beginning, and in recent years Joan (Kate) O'Donnell has been its head, while Susan McNally and Glenna Collett have overseen production coordination and design, respectively. To all of them goes my deep gratitude. In RES's New York editorial office, several assistants have crucially helped me with the preparation of manuscripts for production: Rose Hauer, Rebecca Brimacombe, Cynthia Elmas, Kirsten Swenson, Nuit Banai, Natasha Kurchanova, and, presently, Shannon Wearing. Some of them have been able to successfully complete their doctorates while working at RES. My first child, Giandomenico, was born right at the time when I presented the original proposal for the journal to the Peabody Museum, and my daughter Aurora a few years later; their mother, the anthropologist Gobi Stromberg, has always been very supportive of the project. So too has, for well more than two decades, my present wife, the writer Gini Alhadeff (she, and Shannon Wearing, have helped me revise the form of this editorial). I could not have carried on my task for so long, through several crises and difficulties, without all their encouragement and understanding.</page><page sequence="10">14 RES 65/66 2014/2015 Pinewood Foundation), through a substantial grant to the Peabody Museum Press. After that, the Peabody Museum itself and the Harvard Art Museums, under the enlightened stewardship of William Fash (then director of the Peabody) and Thomas Lentz (director of the Harvard Art Museums), were able to join forces to fund our operations from within the university for a few years. The delayed effects of the financial crisis of 2008, causing a "restructuring" of the University's museums has brought an end to this arrangement, which I had considered the tangible fulfillment of the old dream long ago entertained of somehow integrating the study (and connoisseurship) of artifacts across disciplinary and institutional boundaries, at Harvard and beyond. We have been able to fulfill our commitments to the scholars featured in the present volume, thanks to generous, and serendipitous, private funding (notably from John Fisher, long ago a student at the Peabody Museum), but for the future new solutions will have to be found. Prospects I strongly believe that there is an important role still to be played by a truly multidisciplinary scholarly journal, open to the parallel presentation of different heuristic approaches in the comparative study of art objects, in the multifarious settings of their occurrences in space and time. I believe that the history of RES demonstrates that the breadth and even eclecticism that is required in editing such a journal is not tied to the idiosyncrasies of one or even a few personalities: It is a collective orientation that can continue to be successful with discriminating and sensitive guidance.</page></plain_text>
