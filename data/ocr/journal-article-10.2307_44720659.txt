Schutz Dept. of Industrial and Operations Engineering, The University of Michigan Richard G. Snyder Highway Safety Research Institute and Dept. of Anthropology, The University of Michigan THE PRESENT EASY ACCESS to digital computers has provided the technical capability to model human mobility quantitatively. This paper is the result of research directed toward developing an empirical prediction model of human tor- so mobility. Such a model was desired to assist in determining how people position their torsos when reaching out with their right arm to various fixed points in space. Past computerized man-models have treated the torso as either two or three solid links (1-3)*. This assumption has been necessary due to the dearth of quantitative data regarding torso mobility. The study reported here was designed to: 1 . Gather a complete set of 72 anthropometric dimensions on 28 young men, matched on stature and weight to the larger USAF Anthropometric Survey. *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of pa- per. 2. Develop a means to study the movement of specific torso surface markers in response to reaches with the right arm. 3. Develop a means to study the configuration pattern of the torso skeletal system in response to reaches with the right arm. 4. Develop empirical models which can predict the con- figuration of the bone and surface markers. The surface anthropometric dimensions of the subject and the reach target of the right arm (elbow) would be used as the independent (in- put) variables for the prediction models. It was also believed important to demonstrate the utility of such modeling to engineering design. To serve this end, a graphic output of the model was developed to illustrate how the various bone and surface markers of a seated person move as he reaches about his immediate environment. The following sections describe how the data and resulting prediction model were developed. ABSTRACT Empirical models are presented which predict the three- space position of the torso when responding to reaches with the right arm. Models were derived which specify torso posi- tion in terms of the spadai location of 10 surface markers. These markers were positioned over palpable skeletal points of the spine and shoulder girdle. The necessary data were ob- tained through photogrammetric procedures utilizing four orthogonal cameras. The independent (input) variables to these models are the coordinates of the reach target. A supple- mentary, slightly more accurate, set of models was also de- rived in which the set of independent variables was enlarged to include the anthropometric dimensions of the subject. The second, concurrent phase of the analysis resulted in the derivation of a set of models which describes the configuration of the internal, torso skeletal system. The vector distances and angles between external surface markers and internal bone articulations points can be calculated from these models. A radiographic procedure using orthogonal or oblique x-ray photographs was used to generate the required data. The rela- tive advantages of the present empirical models over the traditional heuristic, hard-link biomechanical models are dis- cussed. 24</page><page sequence="2">SUBJECT ANTHROPOMETRY AND SELECTION OF SUBJECTS The sample was selected from 100 undergraduate engineer- ing students at The University of Michigan. The initial selec- tion was based on stature, weight, and sitting height. From these data 28 men were chosen who matched in stature and weight the USAF Anthropometric Survey of 1967. A com- parison of the subjects stature is presented in Table 1. The University of Michigan sample compares very closely with the 1967 USAF population in the measures of weight and sitting height. The mean weight for the 28 subjects was 174.61 lb, comparing closely to the USAF mean weight of 173.60 lb. The University of Michigan sample had a mean sitting height of 93.1 1 cm, almost identical to the USAF mean sitting height of 93.18 cm. Seventy-two anthropometric dimensions were then taken on the 28 volunteers. To reduce measurement error and en- sure more accurate comparison with the 1967 USAF popula- tion, all measurements were made by the same investigator, utilizing the standardized techniques used by the Air Force Anthropology Branch in their 1967 study. Since anthropom- etrists may, and usually do, differ in technique somewhat, the initial training standardization session at Wright-Patterson AFB proved essential. The intercorrelation coefficients for the 72 dimensions were calculated. These coefficients provided a means to de- fine six functional groups similar to factor analysis. Each of these groups or subsets characterized a different major anthropometric attribute of torso mobility. Many variables which were not related to torso mobility (e.g., head circum- ference) were excluded from further analysis. By scanning the intercorrelation coefficients within each group, a single variable was defined to characterize the other variables in the group as follows: 1 . Standing Stature Group (18 dimensions) was represented by stature. 2. Sitting Height Group (4 dimensions) was represented by sitting height.

Trunk Circumference Group (2 dimensions) was repre- sented by chest circumference. 4. Upper Trunk Breadth Group (2 dimensions) was repre- sented by biacromial breadth. 5. Upper Arm Length Group (2 dimensions) was repre- sented by humeral length. 6. Weight was a separate variable. These six variables were later used to modify the bone and surface marker prediction models to account for individual anthropometric differences. This procedure is described in the next section. PHOTOGRAMMETRY PROCEDURE AND RESULTS Each subject was brought to the photogramme try labora- tory after being x-rayed. This provided the confirmation of the positions of the following surface markers relative to anatomically identifiable skeletal structures: Right acromion Left acromion Suprasternale Cj surface spine marker-cervicale T4 surface spine marker Tg surface spine marker Τ J 2 surface spine marker L2 surface spine marker L5 surface spine marker Right anterior superior illiac spine . He was instructed as to the procedure. Four cameras (three orthogonally placed at the side, front, and above, and one be- hind) were checked to assure that the first frame was posi- tioned, and each camera was focused. The subject was then positioned as described below. With the subject in position the experimenter triggered all four cameras simultaneously by an electronic shutter release. The films were then automati- cally indexed while the subject was instructed as to the posi- tion for the next photograph. The frame identification num- bers were changed, and the procedure was repeated until a total of 35 positions was recorded. The photographs in Figs. 1-4 depict a subject from the four orthogonal views in a sitting configuration. TORSO CONFIGURATIONS STUDIED - The positions each subject was asked to obtain were chosen to create vari- ous levels of torso strain. This was accomplished in the fol- lowing manner. Each subject, either seated or standing, was asked to reach out (forearm vertical) and touch a dull stylus target with the medial/posterior aspect of his elbow. To as- sure consistency with each subject, an inked dot was placed on each subject's elbow for reference. The target positions were selected to obtain a total of 70 different body configurations. For the sitting study they are: 45 Total points on elbow-reach envelope in Table 2, taken in combinations (i.e., 3 horizontal planes χ 5 transversal positions χ 3 reach envelope radii). 3 Vertical reaches (two up and one down). 48 Total sitting positions 25</page><page sequence="3">26 D.

The important thing to realize is that each subject performed 35 different right arm reaches. The end-point elbow positions were selected to assure that each subject performed 28 different reaches. Seven of these 28 posi- tions were then repeated (to give a total of 35 tests) so that an estimate of the inherent, within subject, variability could be computed. The assignment of tests to subjects was done statis- tically according to a balanced incomplete block design. This assured that all the tests were performed an equal number of times, but more important, this prevented any quadrant of the reach sphere from being dominated by the particular anthro- pometric characteristics of a few subjects. SUBJECTS USED IN PHOTOGRAMMETRY STUDY - Not all of the 28 measured subjects were included in the sub- sequent photogramme trie and x-ray studies. Because all the surface points on the body had to be clearly visualized by at least two of the four cameras there was a high probability of losing data. As it was, 15 of the subjects did supply adequate photographic data for the analysis. PHOTOGRAPH DATA REDUCTION - The location of each of the surface markers in each photograph was obtained by rear projection of each photograph onto a Datacoder, produced by the BBN Co., Los Angeles. By moving a cursor over the point of interest and activating the system, a punched-paper tape of the coordinates was prepared. The punched-paper tapes from the Datacoder were then analyzed by a special computer algorithm. This algorithm solves for the three space coordinates of each point by simul- taneously considering the two-dimensional locations of each point viewed from two orthogonal directions. The mean repeatability of the procedure and equipment has been found to be 0.4 in. The output of the computer algorithm is a listing of the three-dimensional (three-space) coordinates of both the 10 surface markers and the corresponding elbow target locations. Punched-card output was also provided for the development of prediction models, as described in the next subsection. PREDICTION MODEL DEVELOPMENT - The photogram- metric data of the surface markers previously listed for the trunk and shoulders was analyzed by developing linear and nonlinear least-squared error regressions of the coordinates of each j**1 surface marker (Xj, Yj, Zj) on each of the elbow co- ordinates (Xe, Ye, Ze), described in Table 2. This modeling does not include anthropometric variables, and hence it is re- ferred to as a General Model of the form: Xj = Fj (Xe,Ye,Ze) Yj = Fj(Xe,Ye,Ze) Zj = Fj(Xe&gt;Ye&gt;Ze) The functions Fj were estimated by stepwise regressions. To perform these regressions, each surface marker was considered initially to be empirically related to the elbow coordinates, elbow coordinates squared, and elbow coordinates cubed. Admissible variables in the final functions were determined from consideration of both the coefficient of determination, R^, and the standard error, Se. When either S0 fell below 0.75 in or the inclusion of an additional variable did not increase R by more than 1%, the stepwise iteration was terminated. Since the sample size exceeded 400 data points for each of Table 2 - Dimensions of Elbow Envelopes* Horizontal Distance from Centerline of Shoulder Joint (Resting) to Target (in) for Various Strain Conditions Maximum Extended Envelope for Two Percentile Male Height of Elbow Comfortable Medium Transversal Positional from Horizontal Target from Normal Extended Sagittal Plane, deg Plane Floor, in Envelope Envelope -45 0 +45 +90 +135 Upper Sitting 44.0 11.0 15.3 24.5 21.5 18.0 17.0 18.0 Standing 62.0 Normal Sitting 37.0 13.0 18.0 24.5 24.5 21.0 20.0 21.0 Standing 55.0 Lower Sitting 30.0 11.0 15.3 24.5 24.5 21.0 20.0 21.0 Standing 48.0 *The envelopes were obtained by checking both 2 and 98 percentile (stature) individuals' elbow excursions for the five transversal planes and three horizontal planes with conditions of "comfortable," "medium extension," and "maximum possible for 2 percentile individual."</page><page sequence="5">28 D. Β. CHAFFIN, ET AL. the regressions, the resulting General Model of Torso Mobility has prediction capability in the widest sense. In most cases, only a limited number of variables were significant in the re- gressions; thus the degrees of freedom of the model remained quite acceptable. A second predictive model was developed to include anthro- pometric variables. This model is referred to as the Anthro- pometric Model. Its development involved including the pre- viously described six anthropometric variables in either linear, squared, or cubed forms in the stepwise regressions. The re- sult of these regressions was a torso mobility prediction model which included significant anthropometry. The Anthro- pometric Model is of the form: Xj - FjPWe-Sj) Yj = FjťX^Z^j) Zj = FjPWeSj) where Sj represents the significant anthropometric variables. The selection of whether a specific anthropometric variable (or its transformation) adds any significant contribution to the prediction of torso configurations was decided by again in- specting both the coefficient of determinations and the stan- dard error estimation. If, in the process of the stepwise re- gression, the coefficient of determination became greater than 70%, an additional variable was not included if it only added 1% to the predicted variance in the surface point locations. Also, a variable was not included if the standard error of es- timation became less than 1 .5 in, which is approaching the average within-subject variability. If the standard error of es- timation was greater than 1 .5 in, and the coefficient of deter- mination was less than 70%, then variables were added until the increase in the coefficient of determination, averaged over the last three variables, was less than 0.5% per variable. MODEL RESULTS - The use of stepwise regressions with as many data points as were available from the photogrammetry study (at least 400 for each surface point) provided good es- timates (as discussed in the next subsection) of how each sur- face point moves as a function of the elbow positions. The results are prediction equations for the X, Y, and Z coordi- nates of each surface marker as the right elbow is positioned in various locations. The coordinates are all specified to the L5 surface marker (base of the spine) or to the seat reference point. An example of the prediction equation coefficients for the movement of the right acromion surface marker is pre- sented in Table 3. Graphical design data have also been pre- pared to illustrate the relative positions of the surface markers. Examples are presented in Figs. 5 and 6. Thirty-four such graphs have been prepared for reference, but even with this many it is a difficult if not impossible task to use them for design. Rather it is suggested that the prediction equations be used directly. At present, one such program has been written which can be executed on a small 8000 word memory com- puter. One result of 4his type of study is that the major anthro- pometric variable in seated torso mobilitity modeling is the sitting height. This particular variable has a directly propor- tional effect on the vertical height of the surface markers, and a secondary but significant effect on the horizontal move- ments of the surface markers. The other anthropometric vari- ables used in the stepwise regressions have much lesser effects on the positions of each torso surface marker for given elbow locations. PREDICTION MODEL ERROR ESTIMATES - There are two major components to the analysis of how well a predic- tion model estimates the value of a dependent variable (that is, the surface marker coordinates). The first component will be referred to as the inherent data variance; for the same set of independent conditions, there is some random variance in the dependent variable, due to a combination of nonrepeating un- controllable factors and basic measurement error. The second component for evaluation of a model is the variance in the data about the predicted values. This is often referred to as the "lack of fit variance," and it indicates the variability of the model over that inherent in the data. Usually, data are presented in one dimensional form, thus its variability is easily evaluated. The surface marker data are in three dimensions, however, and thus its variability is not along a single vector, but is in an infinite number of vectors radiating from its expected value. Fig. 7 illustrates this con- cept. By assuming that the data cluster in a sphere about the expected value or model prediction, statistics can be generated to convey the error of the prediction equations for each sur- face marker. The first statistic developed was the mean vector length_of the points from their expected value. This is desig- nated R. The second statistic is R plus the standard deviation οχ of the vector lengths. These two statistics convey the pre- diction model errors in terms of the radius of a sphere about the expected or predicted value for 50% of the data when Ř is used, or 80% when R + oJ. is referenced. Table 4 presents the values for each surface marker. The first column gives the inherent data variance- how much a given person changes his position for unknown reasons. This is the individual posi- tional repeatability. The second and third major columns de- scribe the errors for both the general model and the anthro- pometric model, respectively. By comparing the values of R in the table, it can be seen that the variability of the anthro- pometric model is two to three times larger than for the sub- jects alone. The variability of the general model is 2.5-3.5 times larger than the pure subject variability. From the engineering design viewpoint, however, the pre- diction accuracy of the model is well within the state-of-the- art. Though it is difficult to compare these project results with other human geometry prediction model results, some analogies will be attempted. The largest single problem in this regard is that existing computerized man-models have slightly different end objectives than this project. Two of the best developed computerized man-models are the results of the Boeing Co.'s Cockpit Geometry Evaluation Project (for JANAIR under ONR contract N000 14-68-0289 and NR213-</page><page sequence="6">HUMAN TORSO VOLITIONAL MOBILITY 29 065), and a University of Michigan Ph.D. thesis project com- pleted by Kilpatrick (1969) (for the MTM Association and the Western Electric Co., Inc.). Both of these efforts assume a linkage representation of the body (two-link torso), which is then oriented in space by both empirical and logic-based alge- braic functions of the hand positions relative to the seat (or pelvis). Tests of the prediction accuracies of these two models have been completed for specific tasks and subject groups (4 υ Spi Seated Side General Ye=10 ne General Model Seated Side View Ye=10 Xe="15 / Xe=15 ' , 4^- Xe=0 / j15 Xe=25 ' 4 Ί 1 Xe=3° 1 ' P-F ' '?5 V3° ' 1 τ8 m 1 ' ' X =30 ' 1 Y~- M,5Xe-2¿^- X =30 ' 1 V» 'i Xe=-15 fS.

In general, it appears that these models can predict the three-space coordinates of their defined shoulder and elbow joints to within a mean vector residual R of about 4 in. In both of these validations a full back support was present, as opposed to only the pelvic sup- port used in the present project. In addition, the validations of these other models did not include the extreme reaches for- ward or to the side and back which were utilized in this project. However, the prediction models developed in this project are based on an elbow position rather than hand positions. The elimination of the forearm and hand links in this project cer- tainly reduces the subjects' freedom of selection. Perhaps this is compensated for by the fact that the lack of a back support gave the subjects a greater degree of torso mobility than in the validations of the other two models by Boeing and Kilpatrick. / ' Spine / ' General Model Π U Seated U // Back View Λ f xe=1° ^ Λ Ζ of Spine"^^^ (inches) ' μ-^br: I I Z=25 Ye--1 5 Ye=0 I ~ Ι I.

Thus the variance in torso mobility which is not explained by the An- thropometric Model is probably related to a combination of such subtle individual differences as muscular development, neurological coordination (learning) of muscle actions, joint/ ligamentous structures, bone articulation geometries, and sur- face marker movements due to variable skin movements. This latter factor is discussed in the next section of the report. In general, though, subject anthropometry does not account for the noted differences in skeletal mobility. Thus, skin move- ments and resulting marker movements are not believed to be major contributors to the residual errors of the prediction models. Finally, one important practical aspect of the torso ge- ometry prediction models should be noted. The models contain 10 surface markers which describe the geometry of the torso, as opposed to the often-used two or three internal links. With a computer graphics capability, these prediction models could be used to depict a more human-like form on a CRT for design reference than the commonly used stick figures. To be capable of doing this, however, computer speed (program simplicity) is needed. The prediction model approach used in this project provides the fastest possible means to torso mo- bility determination. This technique could provide complete torso geometry predictions within 1 s, and with a minimum of computer memory.

RADIOGRAPHIC STUDY OF TORSO BONE CONFIGURATIONS One of the most difficult problems in the construction of human linkage representations (for example, computerized biokinematic models or anthropomorphic dummies) is the lack of data regarding how the joints move during various volitional elbow positions. This section describes how major articula- tions of the human torso are configured in relationship to the position of the body surface markers described in the pre- ceding sections. Specifically, this section presents the pro- cedure and results obtained from a systematic radiographic study of the skeletal forms of a group of persons maintaining a subset of the postures described in the previous section. The results are presented as both graphs and prediction equa- tions which describe the vector distances between various bone articulations and surface markers. Some general conclusions regarding human skeletal torso mobility are drawn from these results. RADIOGRAPHIC PROCEDURE - The first step in develop- ing the skeletal to surface relationships was to assure that a wide range of shoulder configurations would be obtained. This was accomplished by designing a fixture which would locate the right elbow in a set of predefined positions, much like that used for the photogrammetric studies. Table 5 - Bone Articulations that were Studied Description of bone to bone measurements made directly from radiographs. Acromio-clavicular Junction -Bilaterally located at the articulation of the acromion of the scapula and the acromial extremity of the clavicle. Sterno-clavicular Junction -Bilaterally located at the articulation of the lateral aspect of the clavicular notch of the manubrium with the sternal extremity of the clavicle. Proximal Head of the Humerus -The center of mass of the proximal (gleno-humeral) head of the humerus, as determined by the intersec- tion of lines drawn perpendicular to the shaft and at 90 deg across the head of the humerus in an anterior-posterior view of the subject's radiograph. Vertebral Interspaces-Located at the center of inter-vertebral discs and determined by the intersection of a perpendicular plane drawn through the center of the adjoining vertebral bodies, and a horizontal plane equally dividing the intervertebral space. 20 r- Z C5 3 9 I 4+4L^^^y.° ~~~ i ~~~ "/*'^2 · - BONE REF. ν. / 4- - SURFACE MARKER ! ν 14,·· Č3 CLAVICULAR / HUMERAL LINK 1 16 - PLAVICULAÄ LINK ■ 5 -κ- / . = "-v V~rie V* X X. / ' ν« Η LINKS FROM 17 ' &lt; 14 - SURFACE TO BONE ļ μ POINTS N.

For each position a set of one or two oblique or orthogonal x-rays were obtained. To restrict radiation exposure only seven 14 X 17 in x-rays were taken of each subject while main- taining the various torso positions. The x-rays were then read by comparing them to a standard set which had been marked to identify the bone articulations of interest. Table 5 de- scribes these. In total, 18 bone articulations were marked on each x-ray. Twenty-two of the original 28 subjects provided the x-ray data. Eighty-four different torso positions were studied. The data from the marked x-rays were scaled and read into a spe- cial computer program which developed the three-space coor- dinates of each point in a similar manner as was done for the photographs. The output of the program provided vector dis- tances between both adjacent bone articulations and bone-to- surface markers (Fig. 8). RADIOGRAPHIC MODELS - From the vector distances described in the preceding, statistical prediction models were developed. These regressed the bone-to-surface marker vectors onto the right elbow positions. Thus, for given elbow posi- tions the prediction models illustrated the movement of the major bone articulations under each surface marker. Both tabular and graphical data were developed. Figs. 9-1 1 illus- trate the mean vector distances when the right arm is held out in front of the body with the elbow horizontal to the shoulder. Such modeling provided specific dimensional data regarding relative bone to skin movements for specific right arm loca- tions. Some major results for the lumbar spine are: 1 . The vector distances (both from the surface -to-the-spinal interspaces and from vertebral interspace to interspace) did not significantly vary with the general inclination of the lum- bar spine from the vertical. 2. The vertebral column and the surface markers move con- sistently with the general lumbar spine. The regression slopes show that approximately 20% more mobility is contributed by the lower segments (L^/Sj to L3/L4 levels) than by the upper segments (L3/L4 to levels). 3.

This is particularly true for the L^ surface marker. Appar- ently, skin movement over the spine during lumbar flexion compensates for the angular changes of the vertebrae. The analysis of the thoracic spine x-rays indicated the fol- lowing general results: 1 . The distances between both assumed large links of the column, and surface to column links, remain constant with various degrees of flexion and extension. 2. The distances of the surface-to-surface vectors vary with the degree of flexion and extension, displaying that there is a separate movement of the skin over the three thoracic vertebra which were investigated.

CHAFFIN, ET AL. interspaces indicate that there is more movement relative to the column at the Tg level than at the or levels. Thus, the Tj2 and T4 markers would be better for determining the direction of the thoracic spine. 3. The highly consistent movement of the two vertebral links with the reference vector indicates that the thoracic spine moves as a unit. The analysis of the shoulder girdle x-rays provide the fol- lowing general results: 1. The distances for all the bone-to-bone vectors remain constant, regardless of the arm angle. 2. The lack of consistent directional movement in the hori- zontal plane of the two long vectors from the spine to the distal shoulder during arm horizontal movement combined with the very consistent movement of the clavical vector sug- gests that the subjects executed the movements by rotating the shoulder about a point closer to the sternum than the spine. Since the clavical forms a hard link for this rotation, it appears that the data are consistent with anatomical consid- erations. 3. The major objective of determining skin-to-bone move- ment was satisfied in that a large amount of consistent skin movement about the shoulder and upper thorax was docu- mented. 4. The one bone-to-surface vector distance that changed consistently with the arm angle was the vector from the pro- jected humeral head to the humeral surface marker. There is a tendency for this distance to become smaller as the right arm rotates back- towards +135 deg from the forward sagittal plane. Because the surface marker is on the arm, its direction relative to the projected head of the humerus is directly cor- related with the arm horizontal location. This skin movement is also displayed in the vector direction change from the acro- mioclavicular junction. In general, these results show that even when shoulder bone movement is not required for a large range of horizontal arm positions, consistent skin movement occurs at: 1 . The C7/T j level. 2. The acromion. 3. The humeral marker. SCALE: I 1 I INCH ^ ACROMION • · - c7 surf ; ^ ^ ^-~^^'C7/T, VERT. INTERSPACE ^ACROMIOCLAVICULAR JUNC. / /Numeral / Nx^s^SURF.

ILLUSTRATION OF USE OF COMBINED PHOTOGRAMMETRIC AND RADIOGRAPHIC DATA To illustrate one alternative linkage, the general model seated position was used to determine the torso surface marker locations in Fig. 12. The right elbow marker was assumed to be 20 in above, 10 in to the right, and 20 in in front of the L^ surface marker. The seat reference point was located with ref- erence to data relating it to the L^ surface marker. The inter- nal bone reference points were projected from the surface marker locations by referring to the data presented earlier in this section. The general head position was assumed to be in the normal resting position. The cervical neck data were de- veloped in a similar manner as described in the preceding, but the nasion point was used as a reference rather than the elbow. SUMMARY It is believed that the development of empirical prediction models of volitional body configurations is necessary based on two facts. First, from the practical standpoint, empirical models are computationally fast. This has been a major prob- lem with some hard link models which rely on complex numerical algorithms to position each link in space. Second, the ability to generate a hard linkage of other than the arms and legs is extremely difficult, due to the large degree of free- dom made possible by the many small bones and geometri- cally complex articulations that compose the torso, hands, and feet. Empirical modeling should not be the end goal, but it does permit a systematic statement of the data that de- scribe human volitional mobility. By applying the techniques described in this paper, it is believed that eventually enough consistent data will be gathered to construct efficient and ac- curate hard link models of the entire human body.

THE RESULTS from this study are a very significant contri- bution to the understanding of the configuration and mobility of the internal skeletal structure of the human. Although this study was directed at the ergonomie performance of a seated operator, it provides the best information of its type presently available for use in designing the torso linkages for automobile crash test dummies. Possibly more significant than the results presented in this paper is the development and validation of photogrammetric procedures which can be used in further anthropometric studies of human skeletal structure and mo- bility.</page></plain_text>
