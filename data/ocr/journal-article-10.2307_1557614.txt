GRAY SWEENEY Martin Johnson Heade's masterpiece Thun- derstorm over Narragansett Bay of 1868 has long been re- garded as one of the key works of Luminism, "an icon of American art" because of its exemplification of the style, as defined by modem scholars.' In actuality, Heade's spectacular painting of the approaching thunderstorm has less to do with ineffable metaphysical qualities of light, atmosphere, and silence than with the nineteenth- century belief that ships returning to shore before a storm were a metaphor for the stages of the life voyage. In fact, Heade's painting possesses surprising affinities with Thomas Cole's allegorical landscapes and relates directly to such well-known series as The Voyage of Life (1839-1840, and "". : ~ ~~~ ~ ~ ~ ????

Despite its nearly iconic standing today, Heade's work was one which did not elicit much admiration when it was first exhibited in 1868, when a critic described it as "a subject which shows a painful amount of labor with a corresponding feeling of hardness in color and exe- cution . . . it is to be regretted that so hard and chilling a painting as this should have been allowed to leave [Heade's] studio."2 Considering the great attention that has been paid to this work since its rediscovery in an antique shop in Larchmont, New York, in April 1943, it is curious that only a single newspaper reviewer noticed it in 1868 when 2</page><page sequence="2">? . . ? o . .-. rr-Tr Vt i HH At", -:7M?

DERSTORM OVER NARRAGANSETT BAY it was shown twice, first at the National Academy of Design and again later that year at the Brooklyn Art Association. The review indicates that in its day Heade's painting was considered far more complex and proble- matic than modern scholars have found it to be: M. J. Heade exhibits what is perhaps the most notice- able of all the pictures in the exhibition, which he has called "A Thunder Storm on Narraganset Bay. " Every one who has visited the Academy has observed this picture, and every one indulged in criticism upon it. The corner near which it is hung is always crowded, and it is really amusing to mingle with the throng and listen to the conflicting remarks which are made upon it. Criticism on the picture is really very difficult, especially if one takes it by detail, as there is not a single point which does not challenge comment. . . . The only point on which everybody agrees as to Mr. Heade's picture is that it is "very peculiar. "3 This unusual review calls our attention to an approach to the work which provides a key to unravelling the meaning of Heade's work for post-Civil War Americans: taking it detail by detail. In attempting to interpret Heade's painting scholars in the post-World War II era have emphasized what they perceived to be its formal affinities to Surrealism and Luminism, a "school" of American landscape painters 3</page><page sequence="3">first formulated in the late 1940s, though the word itself was actually coined by John I.H. Baur in a 1954 essay.4 The excitement generated by Heade's Thunderstorm over Narragansett Bay played a key role in bringing Heade into the mainstream of the twentieth-century rediscovery of nineteenth-century American landscape painting, and the painting's enshrinement in the canon of Luminism fol- lowed directly from Baur's critical pronouncement in 1954.5 Later scholars still stress the work's striking formal qualities but have also tried to grapple with its expressive meaning, showing a concern for psychological mood as well.6 By 1975 Heade's painting had come to be inter- preted by Theodore Stebbins, in his monograph on Heade, as the representation of one of nature's most terrible moments, "a taut portrayal of an eternal reality ... a painting of a supreme moment, the instant before an inevitable, desired yet feared, paroxysmal release."7 In a 1975 apergu, Roger B. Stein saw the work "as a secu- larized version of [Thomas] Cole's Old Age."' The mood of the painting was held to be one of "almost surreal foreboding ... in large part evoked by reflecting the dark- ness above in the water below, recalling Cole's comments about 'water governed by sky,' " as interpreted by Bar- bara Novak in 1980.' David C. Huntington observed that the spectator of Heade's picture "sees humanity engulfed in the strife of the elements and is offered no sure ref- uge."'o "Every detail is surrealistically clear," John Wil- merding pronounced in the 1987 edition of his American Marine Painting." Concentrating on their own formalist and/or existen- tialist concerns, none of the modern art historians who has written about the painting has attempted an in-depth analysis, considering it detail by detail as the anonymous Martin Johnson Heade, March 1860.

By examining the covert details and by relating Heade's picture to other contemporary works and concerns, it becomes possible to specify the precise qualities in the painting which so engaged the artist's contemporaries, yet have been so little understood today. I will show it possible to read the work without recourse to mid-twentieth-century formalist concepts of Luminism or modern notions about the conditions of human existence. Theodore Stebbins has shown that Thunderstorm over Narragansett Bay is a work unprecedented in Heade's oeuvre.'2 There are no preliminary studies for the paint- ing, either in oil or pencil, and in contrast to his frequent repetition of images (such as haystacks or humming- birds), there are only three other paintings which precede and resemble it. The first of these is The Coming Storm of 1859, followed by the Coastal Scene with Sinking Ship of 1863, and finally the famed Approaching Storm: Beach near Newport, circa 1867, often also cited as a canonical work of the Luminist sensibility. A later oil sketch on paper, Thunderstorm at the Shore, circa 1870, appears to be a plein-air rendering and only distantly and generically related to the meditated and carefully composed structure of Thunderstorm over Narragansett Bay." Furthermore, the large size of Thunderstorm over Narragansett Bay, thirty- two inches by fifty-four inches, is unusual for Heade, whose works were customarily executed in modest di- mensions. Thunderstorm over Narragansett Bay is dated 1868, nine years after Heade moved from Providence, Rhode Island, into quarters in the Tenth Street Studio Building, the center of the Hudson River School. Heade had been out- side the mainstream of New York artists until his move, and he was never to be accepted socially by Studio mem- bers in the years he lived there. In fact he enjoyed very little recognition by his peers during his lifetime. Ac- cording to Stebbins, Heade's personality was "lonely, shy, brusque, quarrelsome, and uncomfortable in the-society of others."'4 As Frederic Church's friend (and from 1866 the tenant of his commodious spaces in the Studio Build- ing), Heade was particularly disliked by Church's arch- rival Albert Bierstadt, who refused even to speak to him." In contrast to the attention lavished on Heade since 1943, at the prime of his career he received less than a page in Henry T. Tuckerman's Book of the Artists (1867), in this period the definitive accounting of the national school of American art. Cole, Durand, Bierstadt, and Church all received a chapter. For Tuckerman Heade's view of Approaching Storm: Beach near Newport was "clever and novel"--hardly high praise from the "American Vasari."'6 As Stebbins notes, Heade was the only important land- scape painter of his time who was not elected as "even an Associate Member of the National Academy of Design, and he was refused membership in the Century Asso- ciation."'7 There are no published references to him in the reminiscences of Worthington Whittredge, John Fer- guson Weir, or Benjamin Champney, and he was not 4</page><page sequence="4">~"''" *.?-ur ~,:ilEtilFZi: ~iiiiiiTiX ?????????-???? ??

Although Heade was a prolific artist who consistently sold his works, generally to middle- class patrons, typically he received very modest sums for his pictures when his contemporaries were selling theirs for far more. His reputation was so insignificant that when he left New York for Florida in 1883 he was entirely forgotten. Heade settled in St. Augustine at the age of sixty-four, and there at last he found a patron who ap- preciated his work, the railroad builder and tourism ty- coon Henry Morrison Flagler. How then is it possible to reconcile the discrepancy between Heade's enormous reputation today and his lack of it during his own lifetime; between the negative tone of the newspaper review of Thunderstorm over Narragan- sett Bay in 1868 and its acceptance since World War II as a key work in the canon of American landscape paint- ing?

Oil on canvas, 28 x 54V4 in. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, gift of Maxim Karolik for the M. and M. Karolik Collection of American Paintings, 1815-1865. The one significant exception to Heade's general lack of regard by the artistic community of New York was his long-standing friendship with the leading landscape painter of the Hudson River School, Frederic Edwin Church. In 1859-1860, when Heade was first listed as a resident of the Tenth Street Studio Building, Church had just opened his studio there. Heade's relationship with Church was a very unequal one, for Church was already established as America's most renowned landscape painter. In 1859 Church had just finished the acclaimed Heart of the Andes (now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art). Its celebrity and Church's urgings may have prompted Heade to make the first of three journeys to South America, probably in search of exotic subjects, with hopes of emulating Church's success with South American scenes. 18 Heade's letters to Church have been lost, but a body of correspondence from Church to Heade has survived.'9 The earliest is dated June 12, 1866, and in it Church tells Heade he can leave his paintings in Church's studio until Heade returns from Nicaragua. In another, on October 5, 1866, after Heade's return, Church says he will "get permission from Mr. Johnson to let my studio but mum at present."20 Apparently their landlord-tenant arrange- ment began at this time; Heade also appears to have acted Martin Johnson Heade, Thunderstorm at the Shore, ca. 1871.

In 1870 Church humorously told Heade "your brandy bottle shows signs of evaporating," and in another letter of the same year, filled with puns, he concludes by asking "do you use the contents of that devil John as a vehicle."2' In a particularly delightful letter illustrated by vignettes, Church rendered Heade's best hat after he had "been exercising in [his] extasy [sic] as [to] the news" that another artist, disliked by Church and Heade, had gotten rooms in the Studio Building. Next to a drawing of bottle labeled "whis" Church playfully writes "Now sleep in peace gentle stranger and dream no more of vile spirits and such. Now for the bad news - I expect to be in town on Saturday!!!!"22 This meant that Heade had to vacate the rooms while Church was in New York. The letters reflect a business relationship with decided advantages for Heade, and a friendship often expressed by solicitude for Heade's well-being. Although they do not prove Heade was an alcoholic, they do perhaps hint at a drinking problem, at least as perceived by the proper Mr. Church. Because of the long duration of the rela- tionship between the two artists, which lasted until Church's death in 1901, and their evident closeness, it is virtually certain that Heade would have learned about Thomas Cole through Church, who had studied with Cole in the 1840s. Heade also visited Church at Olana on a few occasions, and during one of these visits he and Church surely made the short trip across the Hudson River to Catskill, where Cole had lived and where his studio was still a mecca for American landscape painters of the period.23 In 1867, when Heade began work on Thunderstorm over Narragansett Bay, artists in New York, especially those at the Tenth Street Studio Building, looked back at the beginnings of the Hudson River School and recalled its founder. The twentieth anniversary of Cole's death was approaching, in February of 1868, and there was a strong renewal of interest in Cole's work beginning in the spring of 1867 and continuing into 1868. On April 6, 1867, The New York Evening Post carried a long article reviewing the development of the Hudson River School, "Art Remi- niscences. Cole's 'Cross and the World': Artists Life in New York." It contained the observation that "Cole's noblest series of pictures, the 'Cross and the World,' are, after so long a time, at the strong solicitation of his old friends, to be offered for sale by his family.'"24 Exactly who these "old friends" might have been is not precisely known, although one of the strongest candidates must be Church. He had done favors for Cole's impoverished family over the years, and his memorial To the Memory of Cole was painted only two months after Cole's death.25 Further, the article in the Evening Post concluded with the retrospective comment that "the death of Cole made a sad breach in the ranks of the artists who were then most prominent, but since that time landscape art has made a wonderful advance, until now we have a body of landscape painters who would do credit to any age or country."26 The interest in Cole culminated with the exhibition of the three large finished paintings of The Cross and the World in the winter exhibition of the National Academy in December of 1867, where they were listed as "for sale." They were described at length in the exhibition catalogue and were given a lengthy notice in The Evening Post, which observed that "it would be a piece of munificence worthy of some of our wealthy citizens to purchase them and present them to some institution in which they would be regarded as, in some sense, the property of the pub- lic."27 Heade exhibited two paintings in the same exhi- bition and would have seen the Cole works there. Shortly after, in the spring of 1868, he showed Thunderstorm over Narragansett Bay in the next Annual Exhibition at the Academy. Heade could not have escaped awareness of Cole's famous example or of his great influence on the development of the emerging national school of land- scape painting, centered in New York, which Heade sought to join. Cole's earlier series The Voyage of Life had also remained very popular with the public, after being widely repro- duced by the American Art-Union, and it continued to be important up to and during the period when Heade painted Thunderstorm over Narragansett Bay. The first ver- sion of the series remained on public exhibition in New York in the collection of the Reverend Gorham D. Abbott of the Abbott Collegiate Institute. In 1858 the series was the subject of controversy when a scathing review of John Smillie's engravings appeared in The Athenaeum maga- zine.28 A lengthy biographical sketch of Cole's life in The Crayon of 1860 observed that The Voyage of Life is "among the most popular of [Cole's] works ... which, through the engravings of Smillie, are most extensively known."29 Even as late as 1863 copies of Cole's series were sold in New York for over two thousand dollars.30 Despite the shift of taste away from allegorical painting, as Ruskinian tenets of naturalism and "truth to nature" increasingly prevailed, Cole's series entered the prestigious collection of John Taylor Johnson, probably some time in the early 1860s. Johnson's extensive collection was widely re- garded as one of the finest in New York, and was open to visitors during the winter season on Thursday after- noons. In 1874, as first president of the recently estab- lished Metropolitan Museum of Art, Johnson lent the Voyage of Life to the museum in a series of ongoing ex- hibitions. In 1876, after financial reverses, Johnson sold the series for 3100 dollars.31 In 1867, working under the influence of his friend Church, it is clear from the evidence in the works of art that Heade may have attempted to address the popularity of Cole's famous works, especially The Voyage of Life, whose overtly allegorical aspects he altered by creating a secularized conflation of the last two works in the series, Manhood and Old Age, simultaneously adding, in cer- tain key details, imagery related to Cole's last series, The Cross and the World, which he had so recently seen. The atmosphere and mood of Heade's Thunderstorm over Nar- ragansett Bay and Cole's Old Age are remarkably similar, both possessing a dark, somber light and a flat calmness of black waters over a still and silent ocean. 7</page><page sequence="7">Perhaps the disquieting mood that so many modern observers have perceived in Heade's painting consciously recalls sentiments similar to those described in Old Age: "Portentous Clouds are brooding over a vast and mid- night Ocean. A few barren rocks are seen through the gloom ... and the boat, shattered by storms . .. is seen gliding over the deep waters. . . . The world to Old Age, is destitute of interest. There is no longer any green thing upon it."32 To be sure, Heade's painting is not an overtly allegorical image like Cole's, but aside from the faint hints of green in the clumps of grass at left, there is nothing green or living in Heade's picture. The calm in the black water in both Heade's and Cole's paintings creates a time- suspended moment in which the spectator is brought face to face with the terrifying power of nature. It is the boats in the picture which are the most direct link to Cole's series, and they are a key to uncovering the meaning of Heade's work. Heade's vessels evoke as- sociations with the "storm-tossed boats" that Lorenz Eit- ner discussed more than three decades ago. "The image of the drifting boat, sometimes helplessly becalmed ... continued to be used until the end of the [nineteenth] century to spell out a moral or religious message con- cerning the fate of man."33 In Cole's Old Age the traveler's boat, symbol of his voyage through life, is becalmed on a darkened ocean like that of Heade's picture. The boats in Heade's picture suggest, by their position, the stages of the life voyage. At the center, one boat has beached and lowered its sails. A youth and a mature man in a red shirt make their way to shore carrying their oars, while a third figure, an older man, secures the boat's sails. Farther out, other boats are in various stages of lowering their sails and being rowed toward the safety of shore. The skeletal frame of the wrecked ship in the exact center of the foreground evokes associations remarkably similar to those prescribed in Ruskin's commentary "On Boats" which was extensively excerpted in The Crayon of 1856. For a wrecked ship, or shattered boat, is a noble sub- ject, while a ship in full sail, or a perfect boat, is an ignoble one; not merely because the one is, by reason of its ruin, more picturesque than the other, but be- cause it is a nobler act in man to meditate upon Fate as it conquers his works, than upon that work itself.34 The grim presence of the wrecked ship is a haunting reminder of the sea's terrible, wasting power. A symbolic correspondence is established between the ages of the three figures on the beach--an aged figure, a mature man, and a youth--and the skeletal wreck, the beached vessel, with its lowered sails, and the other returning sloops. The wreck is touched with flecks of red paint which are picked up and resonate with the red shirt of the figure above and with the red highlights on the distant boats. The parallel established between the places of the boats on the water and the ages of the figures on the shore creates a meditation on the stages of life and the transience and precariousness of man's worldly exis- tence."35 '21' ??Zl,. - , -'-1A .........I . ... ." . . . . . ...  Xi:'  i!i::: .... ,i,','!, ? .. .l. . .............". c? ,b'/ 64 -... 6A Jim AaA 4, 71-~' I UZ 'IN l / orYd.4; I! ,U ?;~ ??- ?? ?: ::: 50, .?.??? t~ 4' ::.C:ttT;; ;Nle Illustrated letter from Frederic Church to Martin J. Heade, November 25, 1879. Martin Johnson Heade Papers, Archives of American Art. 8</page><page sequence="8">Closely associated with this observation is a powerfully symbolic detail at the extreme left of the painting, filled with covert meaning. A sandy rise is covered with clumps of beach grass, and the decayed timbers of an old fence post emerge between the brown colored leaves to form a fallen cross. Encircling this decayed fence is a vine with red leaves. This form is not coincidental, for Heade's friend Church had often used the vine in combination with both manmade and natural crosses."36 For Heade's and Church's contemporaries the symbolism of the entwining vine would have spoken plainly of Christ's parable "I am the true vine" (John 15:1-17). In Cole's series The Cross and the World the cross, which is sometimes hidden, plays a cru- cial role as the symbol of salvation. Its function in Heade's work is an analogous one--a symbol of death and sal- vation-even if Heade's use of the symbols is more am- biguous than is Cole's. Beneath this natural cross of rotting timbers is another cross of minute size. This tiny but unmistakable cruciform is placed within the triangular intersection of the fallen fence posts above it. Just above the signature and directly below these crosses the earth appears disturbed. Its swell- ing form suggests a human body beneath the sands. The tiny cross, resting at the head of a figure buried in a sandy dune, must be the relic of a sailor's seaside grave, the victim of the shipwreck in the center of the composition. The rotten posts and rails with the red vine thus become explicable as a fallen fence once erected to set off this humble graveyard beside the waters, a memento of some earlier tragedy that the prudent voyagers returning to shore before the storm will avoid. Provocatively, Heade places the crosses directly below the storm-obscured church tower on the opposite shore, a discreet comment on the comparative efficacy of natural and conventional or or- ganized religion. On the shore at right a large curiously formed rock appears. Its shape and position recall a similar form shaped like an aged, drooping head or skull, in virtually the identical position in Cole's Old Age. Careful inspection of Heade's rock reveals that like Cole's grimacing specimen it also possesses an outline which suggests facial person- ification, and indeed there was a convention of repre- senting rocks as anthropomorphized human presences in the landscape." In the extreme right corner a tree limb has been thrown up on the beach by the tides. Its nat- uralized form recalls the writhing and gesticulating ar- boreal actors that occur in a similar position in Cole's Manhood. It seems particularly reminiscent of some of the twigs at the end of Cole's expressively shaped branches which, like the traveler in his storm-tossed boat, even- tually end their journey on the shores of the dark "Ocean of Eternity," as Cole called his black sea in Old Age. Comparisons with the last two paintings of Cole's Voy- age of Life do not end there, for the sky of Heade's painting contains symbols and passages which evoke both Man- hood and Old Age. Perhaps the most obvious of these are the presence of white sea birds flying above the shore and boats. Such birds may be read in the associationist conventions of the period as natural symbols of the host of angelic beings who come down from heaven to greet Thomas Cole, Manhood from The Voyage of Life, 1842.

National Gallery of Art, Ailsa Mellon Bruce Fund. the aged traveler in Cole's Old Age. Their symbolic as- sociation with angels is one long-sanctioned in western art and it is part of a repertoire of such devices frequently employed by Heade. The presence of just such a bird above the cruciform shape of the wrecked ship's mast in Hazy Sunrise at Sea, and similar birds in Approaching Storm: Beach near Newport, indicate that the artist was clearly aware of their role as symbols of divine presence, natural metaphors for guardian spirits. The most surprising aspect of Heade's painting is the sky. Evidently, in its own day what modern scholars have termed the luminist or surrealistic quality of light in the work was considered the most problematic aspect of Heade's picture. The critic in the Brooklyn Eagle had this perception: The sky effect is the only good point in the picture, but even this is marred by the introduction of the flash of lightning. . . . The worst feature however, is to be found in the light and shade, both of which are used in a very inexplicable manner. The whole of the light is, we imagine, supposed to be thrown from some spot in the direction of the right foreground, as the whole of the heavens, so far as seen in the canvas, are com- pletely covered by the dark, massed clouds. If this be so, the reflections cast by the vessels on the bay must be faulty, as they fall upon the waters as if the light were straight above them. The sails of these fishing vessels are also too white, so much indeed that they have quite a "staring" appearance." Long regarded by modern scholars as a principal source of sentiment in the picture, the "inexplicable" quality of Heade's sky and clouds reveals, in actuality, his intimate knowledge of Cole's series. The effect of light seen through sheets of rain resembles comparable effects in the distant sky of Manhood. In the dark lowering band of clouds stretching across the top of the picture are a group of lighter clouds formed to suggest malevolent presences, reminiscent of the three demon faces which appear in the clouds of Manhood. The most obvious of these faces personified in cloud vapor is directly above the lightning bolt which splits the sky. At left other clouds are pierced by holes and have suggestive profiles, heightening their associations with the demon forms of suicide, intemper- ance, and murder in Cole's picture. In Heade's painting these are not specific as they were for Cole, but rather generalized forms indicating the power of nature over human affairs, more subtle reminders of the precarious human condition. Having taken the argument to this point, it remains to return for a fresh look at some of Heade's other marines to ascertain if the concept of the storm-tossed boat is used consistently by the artist as a metaphor for the stages of life. The first painting by Heade in which the black water and dark clouds of Thunderstorm over Narragansett Bay appear is The Coming Storm, painted in 1859, almost a decade earlier. In this work the complex imagery of the 10</page><page sequence="10">1868 painting first begins to emerge. A young man with his dog sits on a broken plank on the shore of a large cove which offers safe harbor to the distant pulling boat and sloop that take refuge from the impending storm. A sense of time suspended before the storm's onslaught is established, and the blackness of the calm waters creates a disturbing mood similar to that in the later work. In several works of 1863 Heade developed the patterns of symbolic association that would reach fruition in the painting of 1868. In Coastal Scene with Sinking Ship, the image of a vessel perishing after a storm, with waves crashing on the curiously shaped rocks in the foreground and other ships at sea, also alludes to the idea of the wreck as a symbol of human fate. A related idea is further developed in Hazy Sunrise at Sea, where the cross-shaped wreck of a ship's mast, with a sea bird above it and other ships under full sail on the distant horizon, plays on the idea of mortality and immortality. The birds and cross would be central devices in the painting of 1868. Heade's The Stranded Boat of 1863, while not directly related to Thunderstorm over Narragansett Bay, presents, with its soli- tary vessel left dry by the receding tides, the single figure on the distant point of land above it, and the other vessels under sail on the horizon, a thoroughly understated vari- ation on the idea of the beached or wrecked vessel as a metaphor for life's journey. Around the same time Heade painted Thunderstorm over Narragansett Bay he painted Approaching Storm: Beach near Newport. Both works possess a similar dark and stormy atmosphere. But unlike Thunderstorm over Narragansett Bay, with its human activity, Approaching Storm: Beach near Newport is a solitary landscape destitute of figures. Only the presence of three tiny sloops with their "staring" white sails relieve the overpowering atmosphere of a landscape of eerie power, rendered with sharply defined form--a meditative moment of heightened insight ap- propriate to the calm before the storm. At left a sandy beach is dominated by rocky cliffs whose forms, like the rock forms in Thunderstorm over Narragansett Bay, are curiously formed. Unlike the "truth to nature" found in the rocks of contemporaries like John F. Kensett or Alfred Bricher, these rocks are given a strange, foreboding pres- ence. Heade who absorbed much of this convention from his friend Church, makes his own contribution here to the tradition of symbolic personification in ostensibly in- animate natural objects. The tallest rock is painted in such a way that a human profile is etched into its surface, positioned so that it stares directly up at the single bird. Again, the idea of natural forms as poetic metaphors for human presences and as representing the concept of a vitalistic nature is one which can be traced back through Church to Cole. Heade would certainly have had ample opportunity to study manifestations of the idea in The Voyage of Life which is full of such anthropomorphic per- sonification. Harbor View at Sunset of 1874 (now in a private col- lection) is the last of Heade's large scale expositions of the theme of the storm-tossed boat, and in it the concepts explored from the early Coming Storm through Thunder- storm over Narragansett Bay are used with particular ac- complishment and power. The painting is permeated with Church's influence and with more distant allusions to Cole, a carefully balanced composition in which Heade uses the same images - crosses made by the sun or formed by a wrecked ship's mast, vessels at various stages of their journeys - to create another symbolic portrayal of the voyage of life and a conventional prospect of immor- tality.39 It is the light in Harbor View at Sunset which is Martin Johnson Heade, Hazy Sunrise at Sea, 1863.

In reflecting on the meaning of Heade's work it is essential to remember that there was a cultural mind-set of mid-nineteenth-century viewers which disposed them to read meaning into nature, and hence into images of nature. The educated audience for Heade's paintings would have been more willing to believe that the natural world revealed great moral and spiritual lessons than most peo- ple today. The critic for the Brooklyn Eagle forcefully re- minds us of this habit of mind when he notes that every- one who saw Thunderstorm over Narragansett Bay in 1868 "indulged in criticism of it," that it elicited "conflicting remarks," and that it was a "very difficult" picture to interpret. Such unusual commentary provides us im- portant clues as to how the audience approached Heade's works. This documentation compels us to inquire if the meanings of such works are richer and more complex than may have been previously suspected by modem scholars, most of whom approached these "rediscovered" pictures from a formalist perspective, anxious to explain their relevance to modernist movements such as Surre- alism. If this is the case, is it not appropriate first to attempt to read them within the context of artistic, cultural, and religious values of their day before resorting to the at- tribution of unspecified surrealistic elements or the even more nebulous attributes of Luminism, formalist terms that are strictly creations of the present century? Undoubtedly, Heade's Thunderstorm over Narragansett Bay was as provocative and elusive in its ultimate sig- nificance for the artist's contemporaries as it may be to- day, but it is entirely reasonable to state that it also con- Martin Johnson Heade, detail from Thunderstorm over Narragansett Bay.

Perhaps the modernist sensibility which these earlier commentators sensed is due in some part to its singularly unrelieved tenor of pessimism. It is a depiction of a stormy landscape where the forbidding sentiment expressed in the sky and sea is without hope--without the proverbial "silver lin- ing" so much favored by mid-century American land- scape painters and their patrons and so satisfactorily de- livered by Cole.4 One might be tempted to ascribe this pessimistic view of the human condition to some proto- or pre-existential sensibility, but as I have demonstrated, a more plausible explanation may be found in Heade's imaginative involvement with Cole's great series and in the artist's difficult personality. Despite the various mean- ings attached to it by modem art historians, perhaps the only certain thing we can say about the painting, given the relatively sparse documentation that has survived, is that Heade's contemporaries found it odd, enigmatic, "very peculiar." J. GRAY SWEENEY is Professor of Nineteenth-Century Amer- ican Art in the School of Art at Arizona State University. He has published extensively on regional American art and curated numerous exhibitions. He is currently at work on a study of Thomas Cole's influence on mid-century landscape painters. NOTES 1.

Stebbins suggests that Heade may have seen Fitz Hugh Lane's Schooners before an Approaching Storm (1860, Collection J. D. Rockefeller IV), although Heade's work is far more chilling than Lane's realistic picture, and the role of the details is not applicable in Lane's painting. Stebbins also suggests that Courbet's Marine of the early 1840's may have been an influence, although the technique of Courbet's work is significantly different from Heade's. Stebbins does not offer any indication of how Heade might have encountered such works. Nonetheless, the iconographic motifs in both Lane and Courbet of the "storm-tossed boat" may be common to numerous works of the Romantic and realistic traditions in both American and ErTope, as Lorenz Eitner suggests (see note 33). 13.

In a letter of May 26, 1870 (Martin Johnson Heade papers, Archives of American Art, microfilm roll D5, frame 641), Church humorously remarked to Heade, "So Bierstadt won't speak to you - hey - why don't you draw him out. Ask him if he don't want to buy some butterflies." This comment related to Bierstadt's creation of painted butterflies, which he often presented to guests in his studio as souvenirs. 16. Henry T.

This collection of letters from Church to Heade is preserved in the Heade papers, Archives of American Art (microfilm roll D5, frames 621-721). The letters from Heade to Church have not survived because the great body of correspondence that Church is known to have ac- cumulated, as well as his copies of his own correspondence, were taken by Church's first biographer Charles Dudley Warner and have never been located. It is presumed that they were discarded after Warner's death. Obviously, this considerable void in documentation makes it difficult to precisely track Church's relationship with artists like Heade. 20. Letter from F. E.

Cropsey visited Cole's home and studio and reported in a letter to his wife, "After breakfast we were invited to the studio. . . . We entered; it seemed as if Mr Cole would be in in a few minutes for every thing remains as when he last left painting. ... Though the man has departed, yet he has left a spell behind him that is not broken, as you may sit there upon the sofa, and look upon his works, we will feel more than ever the devotion, genius and spirit of the man." See "'The brushes he painted with that last day are there ...'. Jasper F. Cropsey's Letter to His Wife, Describing Thomas Cole's Home and Studio, July, 1850," The American Art Journal XVI (Summer 1984): 78-82. Cole's studio remained open as a mecca for Hudson River School artists well into the 1870s, and many of the works he left behind were still in situ as late as the 1920s when they were finally sold off by his heirs. 24.

The article paid special attetion to Cole's three series. "Cole was a man of great religious sensibilities, which he showed in that beautiful series of pictures called the 'Voyage of Life.' In the last of these pictures he represented the old man, whom he has carried from childhood, watched over by his good angel, to presumptuous youth, flushed with hope; then through early manhood, surrounded by all the demons of destruction, down to old age; now entering the ocean of eternity, his oars of self reliance broken, his splendid bark shattered, sitting helpless and repentant when the good angel returns once more to open before his upward gaze the bright path to heaven."

Parry, The Art of Thomas Cole: Ambition and Imagination (Newark, Delaware: University of Delaware Press, 1988), p. 342-361. The large canvases of this famous series are lost, and only four of the five studies are extant. See Figure 295 in Parry's monograph for a reconstruction of the series, based on the existing works and photographs. The series was described in ex- tensive notes published in the catalogue for the Memorial Exhibition at Cole's death in 1848. 25. See J. Gray Sweeney, "Endued with Rare Genius: Frederic Edwin Church's To the Memory of Cole," Smithsonian Studies in American Art (Oxford University Press, Winter 1988): p. 45-71. Another leading candidate for one of the "old friends" must be John Falconer, an amateur artist and collector in Brooklyn, but while he may have assisted the family with practical matters, Church would possessed the social, political, and artistic connections to have attempted to add Cole's series to the then still-under-discussion Metropolitan Museum of Art. 26.

Lorenz Eitner, "The Open Window and the Storm-Tossed Boat: An Essay in the Iconography of Romanticism," The Art Bulletin 37 (December 1955): 281-290. Eitner points out that the metaphor of the storm-tossed boat is ancient and familiar. "Used to dramatize man's struggle against fate or against nature, or to point up the need for salvation, it occurs in poetry and painting with the frequency of a popular figure of speech. A typical expression of it is in this line from John Webster's White Devil, written about 1610: "My soul, like a ship in a black storm, is driven, I know not whither" (p. 287). Robert Rosenblum has also commented extensively on the persistence of the boat as a symbol of the life voyage in northern Romantic painting. See Robert Rosenblum, Modern Painting and the Northern Romantic Tradition (New York: Harper and Row, 1975).

"On Boats," The Crayon, November, 1856, p. 335. 35. The classic paradigm of this concept in European art is Casper David Friedrich's Stages of Life, 1835 (Museum der Bildenden Kunste, Leipzig). In this work the five ships and their relative positions and sizes, as well as the positions of their sails correspond to the positions and ages of the figures on the shore. There is no evidence that Friedrich was known in the United States during the mid-nineteenth century; nonetheless the affinities between his work and that of Cole and Heade are remarkable and provide useful insights into the presence of similar religious symbolism in American art of this period. 36. Church's use of this symbol of the vine-entwined cross first appears in To the Memory of Cole (1848, Des Moines [Iowa] Women's Club). It appears again in The Andes ofEcuador ( 1855, Reynolda House Museum), and in 1859 in Church's Heart of the Andes (Metropolitan Museum of Art). In 1863 Church included a tiny vine-covered cross in Chimborazo (Huntington Library and Gallery). The sources of this motif in Cole's The Cross in the Wilderness (1845, The Louvre) and in Home in the Woods (1847, Reynolda House Museum) have been discussed in my "Endued with Rare Genius." 37. J.
