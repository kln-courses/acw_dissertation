<plain_text><page sequence="1">Oedipal Gods and Moral Man by S. H. Posinsky, Ph.D. This paper discusses the ancestry of Zeus, as recorded by Hesiod. The various dimensions of the myth are analyzed, and several of its modern implications are pointed out. I Working a century ago with the data of classical myth ology, Bulfinch asked an already ancient question: "Whence came these stories? Have they a foundation in truth, or are they simply dreams of the imagination?" (1) In a sense, myths are the products both of truth and imagination. Their origins go back to the most remote antiquity, and their mean ings can vary with the orientations and purposes of the in terpreter. That myths have historic and symbolic meaning can no longer be doubted; yet they are not interchangeable with history or dreams. They are "historic" to the degree that they reveal aspects of the cultural past, and because they contain survivals of infancy (of the individual and the species). Since the historic value of specific myths varies and must be evaluated in the light of archaeological and other reconstructions, mythology records an evolutionary rather than a truly historic process, with some myths being "more historic" than others. The symbolic meaning of mythology has best been eluci dated by Abraham. (2) Using the psychoanalytic method of dream interpretation, Abraham has elicited the inner meaning of myths such as that of Prometheus, and of Bible stories like those of Moses and Samson. Abraham indicates that dreams 1. Thomas Bulfmch, Bulfinch's Mythology, Modem Library edn., New York, no date, p. 240.</page><page sequence="2">102 S. H. Posinsky, Ph.D. and myths are unconscious and symbolic wish-fulfillments which are common to the human race ; that both are survivals of infancy, in a phylogenetic and ontogenetic sense; and that both employ the processes of condensation, displace ment, and secondary elaboration. In this sense, therefore, any verifiable historic data within a myth are analogous to the residues of the day which enter into a dream. Nevertheless, myths and folktales, being socialized dreams and fantasies, are not completely identical with their individ ual counterparts. (3) Individual dreams and fantasies are quickly forgotten; while myths, even if they are putatively derived from dreams, (4) undergo a process of cultural selectivity and transmission. Unconscious strivings and con flicts are removed from the tenuous command of the ego and are projected onto the impersonal fabric of culture, where they can be observed objectively and abreactively, since the ego is no longer threatened. Part of this process consists of the transmutation of unconscious strivings into culturally meaningful terms; and part of it consists of the imposition of form, whether verbal or written, and again in cultural terms. Thus, in "making" myths, the "dreamer" is not only the child of a specific culture, but he is also imposing form and limits on raw unconscious data. Although this process of cultural selectivity and trans mission is not completely understood, a significant insight has been provided by Devereux. He suggests that some as pects of a culture — myths, ritual, etc. — may serve as an im personal ' ' cold storage " for a number of individual fantasies : These fantasies are too intensely laden with affect to be re pressed, but are also too ego dvstonie to be freely recognized as subjective and as pertaining to oneself.

(5) This formulation explains in part why moral (i.e., social) man represses his oedipal and preoedipal strivings, and regales himself and his fellows with the tricks or crimes of gods and heroes. (6) These culturally transmitted projections — and the mythopoesis which they reflect — have their contemporary counterparts in the undisguised sexuality and sadism of the comic book, movie, television, etc. Though grossly commer cialized, the popular arts appear to have abreactive value; but they also seek the lowest common denominator and may even encourage tendencies toward acting-out. This problem is still obscure, both in its theoretical and empirical aspects, and any possible clarification is inhibited by the manipulators of the mass media of entertainment. Greek mythology is not homologous to the commercial ized arts but it may share certain functional analogies. At any rate, it provides a valuable time-perspective and it is suf ficiently alien to allow some degree of objectivity. II One of the most fascinating myths of ancient Greece was systematized in the eighth century B. C. by Hesiod, who, to a considerable extent, with Homer, provided the classical Greeks with the substratum of their religious tradition. Con cerning the creation of the universe and the genealogy of the gods, Hesiod wrote in the Theogony: 5.

In the Judaeo-Christian tradition of modern western civilization, the positive and, negative traits of gods and heroes have been dichotomized: there are gods and heroes; devils and criminals. The unity of goodness and badness in the person of the deity or trickster-hero is an alien coneept.</page><page sequence="4">104 S. H. Posinsky, Ph.D. Verily at the first Chaos came to be, but next wide-bosomed Earth [Gaia] and Eros. . . . And Earth first bare starry Heaven [Uranus], to cover her on every side, and to be an ever-sure abiding place for the blessed gods. And she brought forth long Hills, graceful haunts of the goddess nymphs who dwell amongst the glens of the hills. She bare also the fruitless deep with his raging swell, Pontus .... But afterwards she lay with Heaven and bare deep-swirling Oceanus, Coeus and Crius, Theia and Rhea, Themis and Mnemosyne and gold crowned Phoebe and lovely Tethys. After them was born Cronos the wily, youngest and most terrible of her children, and he hated his lusty sire. . . . And Heaven used to hide them all away in a secret place of Earth so soon as each was born, and would not suffer them to come up into the light: and Heaven rejoiced in his evil doing. But vast Earth groaned within, being straitened, and she thought a crafty and an evil wile. Forthwith she made the element of grey flint and shaped a great sickle, and told her plans to her dear sons. And she spoke, cheering them, while she was vexed in her dear heart: "My children, gotten of a sinful father, if you will obey me, we should punish the vile outrage of your father; for he first thought of doing shameful things." So she said; but fear seized them all, and none of them ut tered a word. But great Cronos the wily took courage and answered his dear Mother: "Mother, I will undertake to do this deed, for I reverence not our father of evil name, for he first thought of doing shameful things." So he said: and vast Earth rejoiced greatly in spirit, and set and hid him in an ambush, and put in his hands a jagged sickle, and revealed to him the whole plot. And Heaven came, bringing on night and longing for love, and he lay upon Earth, spreading himself full upon her. Then the son from his ambush stretched forth his left hand and in his right took the great long sickle with jagged teeth, and swiftly lopped off his own father's members and cast them away to fall behind him. (7) Cronos, having castrated his father, and having separated his parents (Heaven and Earth), set himself up to reign over the universe. He married his sister Rhea, a second incarnation 7. Hesiod, Theogony, in The Homeric Hymns and Homerica, Loeb Classical Library, Heinemann, London, 1914, pp. 87-93.</page><page sequence="5">Oedipal Gods and Moral Man 105 of the Earth-Mother ; and she bore him many children : These great Cronos swallowed as each came forth from the womb to his mother's knees with this intent, that no other of the proud sons of Heaven should hold the kingly office amongst the deathless gods. For he learned from Earth and starry Heaven that he was destined to be overcome by his own son, strong though he was. Therefore he kept no blind out look, but watched and swallowed down his children: and un ceasing grief seized Rhea. But when she was about to bear Zeus, the father of the gods and men, then she besought her own dear parents, Earth and starry Heaven, to devise some plan with her that the birth of her dear child might be concealed, and that retribution might overtake great crafty Cronos for his own father and also for the children whom he had swallowed down. (8) Zeus was born of the union of Cronos and Rhea, and he was immediately hidden by his mother. When Cronos came to devour the newborn baby, Rhea followed the advice of her parents and gave Cronos ... a great stone wrapped in swaddling clothes. Then he took it in his hands and thrust it down into his belly: wretch ! he know not in his heart that in place of the stone his own son was left behind, unconquered and untroubled, and that he was soon to overcome him by force and might and drive him from his honours, himself to reign over the deathless gods. (9) Zeus married his sister Hera, who was also able to con ceive hermaphroditically in the tradition of the first Earth Mother. But Hera is not a fertility goddess (her androgynous quality is an inappropriate and anachronistic device to spare Zeus any responsibility for the birth of inferior or disloyal children), and she is closer to the modern stereotype of the jealous and nagging wife. Writing during the reign of Zeus, Hesiod censored the last portions of his narrative. The details of Cronos's destruc tion are politely omitted, but the implications are clear and follow the previous pattern. To conclude the poem, Hesiod 8. Hesiod, op. cit., p. 113. 9. Ibid., p. 115.</page><page sequence="6">106 S. H. Posinsky, Ph.D. sang the victory of Zeus, who established the Olympian Pan theon, divided the universe among the "departmental" gods, and inaugurated the "kingdom of man." The myth of Uranus, Cronos, and Zeus was, in the Greek world at least, the prototype of the Oedipus theme ; and it was interpreted in that light by Greek writers. Interestingly enough, this series of incestuous chain-reactions among the gods has a disguised repetition during the era of Zeus, when one of his sons, Hephaestus, goes to Hera's aid when Zeus is beating her — a milder reiteration of the previous themes. (10) Zeus is so angered by his son's interference that he hurls Hephaestus to earth, injuring his leg in a symbolic castration. (In the Homeric version, Hephaestus was born with this in jury, and androgynously, thus sparing Zeus any responsibility for the boy's imperfection and disloyalty.) Hephaestus does not attempt any retaliation, nor even a return to heaven ; and Hera is powerless to help him. Rather, he establishes himself as the busy god of fire and metallurgy, with workshops under the earth. He never becomes a menace to Zeus in the manner of Satan or Ahriman, or as Cronos and Zeus had been to their own fathers. With the final establish ment of the Pantheon, Zeus is supreme and eternal; and all efforts to dislodge him are unsuccessful. (11) The ancient Greeks recognized that chance and necessity play a part in human life, but they did not postulate a struggle 10. Even the theme of cannibalism or incorporation is repeated, when Zens swallows his wife. Cf. Arthur B. Cook, Zeus, three vols., Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1914-40. 11. Tityos, another son of Zeus, rapes his father's wife; he is punished by being stretched out and exposed to vultures who eat his liver. Prometheus, a titan akin to Cronos, is partially successful in thwarting Zeus and is punished in the manner of Tityos. Pro metheus's victory, however, is disguised and symbolic. Cf. Freud, "The Acquisition of Power over Fire" (1932), in Collected Papers, V, Hogarth Press, London, 1950. The hypothetical identity of Cronos and Prometheus is also sig nificant, for Cronos is both the castrator and the castrated. Cf. Géza Böheim, The Middle of the Sphinx, Hogarth Press, London, 1934, p. 268, f.n. 3.</page><page sequence="7">Oedipal Gods and Moral Man 107 on the divine level between good and evil, or between light and darkness, with the behavior of mortal men tipping one side or the other in this precarious balance. Real and dram atic as this conflict was to the Near Eastern mind, and still is in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, such a struggle would have impressed the more naturalistic and monistic Greeks as bad housekeeping on the part of the supreme deity. And even impersonal chance and necessity, like the lesser female fates and furies, do not oppose Zeus but man. Though they overlap the power of the Olympians, they appear to be pre-Hellenic deities, or vestiges of these, which have no significant relation to the true Princes of Darkness or to Anti-Christ. Although formally polytheistic, the sophisticated Weltan schauung of the Greeks was more naturalistic and monistic than the outlook possessed by the cruder, though monothe istic, cultures of the Near East. Shaped in an equally severe patriarchal society as the peoples of the Near East, the Greeks were apparently less infantile and more self-reliant — and considerably more narcissistic. At any rate, they were better equipped psychologically to handle the ambivalence which is so typically directed toward the deities and other parent figures. While the peoples of the Near East required evil (or fallen) gods on whom to project the negative aspects of this infantile ambivalence, the Greeks were apparently not troubled by the fact that Zeus the Savior could also be un justly and irrationally brutal, or merely lecherous, unstable, and silly. Ill The myth recorded by Hesiod is rich in meanings, and on many levels ; but it contains no historic data. Taking place at the dawn of time, it records no migrations, technological changes, or the like, which are sometimes echoed in myth ology. Nor are the precise origins of the myth completely clear. Gaia, Uranus, Rhea, and Cronos are elemental forces, though crudely anthropomorphized ; and they appear to represent the pre-Hellenic deities which were absorbed into the Olympian religion by the mobile herdsmen who raided</page><page sequence="8">108 S. H. Posinsky, Ph.D. and settled archaic Greece. Since there was an amalgamation of several religions, it would seem that the pre-anthropo morphic history of Zeus was either omitted completely or displaced to a later era (for example, Zeus as snake, as thun derbolt, and so on). (12) In the light of Hesiod's version of the creation of the universe and the genealogy of the gods, a diffusion of ideas from the Near East seems unlikely — especially in the absence of a first male authority who commands the universe into existence. In the Greek myth there is an original creation without edict or authority. Creation does not occur out of nothingness or the void, as in the Indo-European tradition; rather, there is an emphasis on the emergence of order and substance out of primal chaos. Just as Greek science, cosmolo gy, and Weltanschauung were evolutionary, atomistic, and "Polynesian," so is the clear conception of the priority of Chaos and Eros — in different terms, the polarity of aggres sion and love. (The contemporary significance of these con cepts derives from Freud's pioneering efforts ; but they are ba sically Polynesian and unwestern.) Equally clear are the ag gressive and erotic motivations underlying the several creations and transformations, and also the supreme position of the first Earth-Mother. A historical connection between pre-classical Greece and Polynesia is quite unlikely, if only because the latter culture is considerably more recent; but there are several further parallels which are of interest. Thus, Tylor, using the Maori mythology collected by Sir George Grey, describes how Tane mahuta forcibly separated his parents, Rangi (Heaven) and Papa (Earth), except that Tane-mahuta, the god of forests, is himself forcibly subdued by his fierce brother, Tawhiri ma-tea, the god of storms and winds, who drives everything before him and compels the Earth-Mother to conceal all her 12. For a discussion of the primitive and rational aspects of the Hesiodie cosmogony, see George Thomson, Studies in Ancient Greek Society, Vol. II: The First Philosophers, Lawrence and Wishart, London, 1955, pp. 148-55.</page><page sequence="9">Oedipal Gods and Moral Man 109 children from her son's anger. Tylor, unwilling even to guess about the origin of these concepts, compares them neverthe less to the forcible separation of Heaven and Earth in ancient Chinese mythology. But there is no evidence which can ex plain how these old Chinese or Polynesian myths could have been diffused into pre-classical Greece, to be retained in a relatively pure form despite the different influences from Europe and the Near East. Tylor points to similar Earth-Mothers and Sky-Fathers among the Peruvians, Caribs, Huron, Algonquin, and Co manche; and there is even a real homology between Zeus's ancestors and the Brahman Dyaushpitar ("Heaven-Father") and Prthivî Mâtar ("Earth-Mother"). In the latter case, of course, we are on safer ground, for Zeus had a namesake Dyaus in ancient India. (13) Nevertheless, the Greek myth, in all its aggressive and erotic force, seems nearer in spirit to Polynesian cosmology. Even the subsidiary theme of the engulfing monster is echoed in the death of Maui, (14) ex cept that the trickster-deity Maui is engulfed by a female ancestor in a modified oedipal situation, while the male titan of Greek mythology devours his own children (as Zeus swal lows his wife) in order to prevent another oedipal situation from developing. Tylor discusses "engulfing monsters" from a variety of cultures, and he concludes that they originate in the familiar spectacle of day and night, light and darkness. (15) Among these engulfing monsters he includes whales, wolves, and clocks ; the related ascents into the heavens and descents into the earth; the elaboration of anthropomorphic solar deities and heroes; and the formulation of myths in which the "death" and "rebirth" of the sun are equated with human death and resurrection. The phenomena which Tylor lumps together are not related to each other by any clear historical 13. Sir James G. Frazer, The Worship of Nature, Vol. I, Macmillan, London, 1926, p. 53. 14. 8. H.

Posinsky, Ph.D. connections over such a wide portion of the globe, nor do they manifest any structural homologies which would trace them to a common cultural ancestor. If it is even possible to deal with such a broad distribution of variant themes, we must first reduce the whole problem to its lowest common denominator, the strong unconscious fears and wishes which unite these myths. In this sense, natural phenomena, like cultural data and other residues of the day, may be assim ilated to unconscious conflicts and serve as a kind of screen memory in the interests of repression. (16) The engulfing monster could pass as a plausible Jungian archetype, with or without the sometimes related bull-roarer. But since Jung's concept of the collective racial unconscious is both the most comprehensive and the least satisfactory explanation of similar phenomena, where neither racial nor cultural connections can be demonstrated, it is safer to as sume that, apart from any verified evidence of diffusion, similar phenomena and processes have resulted in similar explanations, even if on vastly different cultural levels. These psychic similarities, in other words, derive from similar pre oedipal and oedipal conflicts, but are variantly colored by the culture in which they take verbal shape. IV As systematized by Hesiod, the Theogony is a mixture of elemental abstractions and observable natural phenomena, all held together by a progressively more human coherence and motivation. (As we shall note presently, it is also a mixture of pre-oedipal and oedipal fears and wishes which are finally "renounced" under the primacy of Zeus.) The poem begins as a creation myth, becomes a transformer tale, and then ends as "historical mythology" with the victory of Zeus and the establishment of the Olympian Pantheon. Restricting themselves only to literal details, and dis 15. Sir Edward B. Tylor, Primitive Culture, Vol. I, fifth ediu, John Murray, London, 1929, pp. 320-53. 16. Cf. Posinsky, op. cit.</page><page sequence="11">Oedipal Gods and Moral Man 111 regarding the psychic "archaeology" of the myth, the first modern interpreters, from Hegel to Bulfinch and Tylor, saw it in purely Aesopian or allegorical terms, although the more deliberate Hegel read into it a meaning which harmonized with his own philosophy. Philologists differ in their etymology of Cronos's name, but it has become traditional to equate it with time — which consumes everything which it has brought into being. Whether the traditional interpretations, limited to manifest details, are not a series of subjective and ex post facto ration alizations is in itself no small problem, especially since the subtle metaphysical and allegorical implications read into the myth by each new generation could hardly have been of conscious significance to amoral poets like Homer and Hesiod. Nor can we ignore the fact that both were self-conscious artists who chose their sources from various traditions in the interest of a new amalgamated whole. As allegory, the myth can be abstracted on a purely manifest level. The first primeval element introduced by Hesiod was Chaos, followed by Gaia (Earth-Mother) and Eros. Overcoming Chaos, Gaia and Eros created the hills, seas, and so on, all of them being elemental and amoral forces. With the birth of Uranus, these elemental forces and objects begin to achieve human traits. Uranus is not only the Sky-Father, from whom the cyclops, furies, and titans are descended, but he already possesses several exaggerated char acter traits: an abundant and uninhibited sexuality, and a consequent fear of his many children. Uranus hid his chil dren and robbed Earth of her fruit; and he was also some thing of a nuisance sexually, being, in Hesiod's words, con stantly upon Gaia and bringing with him prolonged darkness. To prevent the re-emergence of Chaos,. Gaia rebelled and plotted with Cronos to mutilate Uranus, and thus Heaven was separated from Earth, permitting again the operations of time and tide, day and night, warmth and cold, and the self regulating freedom of Earth's creative forces. The victory of Cronos (time) marks the beginning of a new era. The old seasons and cycles return (for day and night, according to</page><page sequence="12">112 S. H. Posinsky, Ph.D. Hesiod, were older than Uranus) ; but the new and dramatic factor of irreversibility enters the universe under the symbolic rule of time. Chaos had been averted by Gaia and Cronos, but only at the cost of a new despotism. Cronos was the reincarnation of his father on a slightly less elemental level; and, having learned from his unhappy father's experience, set himself to order, watch and destroy the creative and spontaneous forces of life as symbolized by the Earth-Mother. Cronos was ap propriately cannibalistic and he destroyed whatever he had brought into being, again bringing grief to the Earth-Mother. Cronos was an indiscriminate monster, and Rhea duped him with a swaddled stone; this permitted Zeus to survive and to grow strong, until the time came when he prevented time from devouring his own children. Saved by his mother's trick, Zeus ultimately established the immortality of the gods, pushed the cyclops and titans to the periphery of the world, and created mortal man in his own image. If Zeus was some times characterized as a sexual athlete, no doubt an inherited trait, he was also honored as the father and savior of man, as "Zeus the Preserver," with special libations to him for his victory over the blind forces of nature. This has been the traditional interpretation of the myth. Limited to manifest details, it must remain an allegory. But the myth has different levels of meaning, and it is in a sense an archaeological cross-section of the Greek mind. Compressed in a short poetic narrative are the religion and psychology of the Greeks, from the primitive and pre-animistic worship of elemental forces, through animism, toward the more rational and naturalistic outlook, fundamentally irreligious, which per meated high Greek philosophy. Insightful,, even if rigid, Hegel distorts the myth to fit it into his Christian-Prussian synthesis. Disapproving in no uncertain terms of the "various disgusting adventures" of Zeus, Hegel nevertheless sees the myth as a victory of male Spirit over female Nature, as an alliance of Spirit and Man against Nature and Woman:</page><page sequence="13">Oedipal Gods and Moral Man 113 This degradation of Nature is in the Greek mythology the turning point of the whole — expressed as the Wars of the Gods, the overthrow of the Titans by the race of Zeus. The transition from the Oriental to the Occidental Spirit is therein represented, for the Titans are the merely Physical — natural existences, from whose grasp sovereignty is wrested ... It must be further observed that the Greek gods are to be re garded as individualities — not abstractions, like ' ' Knowl edge, " " Unity, " " Time, " " Heaven, " " Necessity. ' ' Such abstractions do not form the substance of these divinities; they are no allegories, no abstract beings, to which various attributes are attached. . . . The gods are personalities, con crete individualities: an allegorical being has no qualities, but is itself one quality and no more. . . . While they have each an individual character, the Greek gods are also repre sented as human, and this anthropomorphism is charged as a defect. On the contrary, we may immediately rejoin, man as the Spiritual constitutes the element of truth in the Greek gods, which rendered them superior to all elemental deities, and all the mere abstractions of the One and Highest Being. (17) Hegel emphasizes the development of personality among the Greek gods; but, moving relentlessly toward the final superiority of the Christian religion, he picks and chooses among the "superior" aspects of the previous religions. If his words sound Hellenic or Nietzschean rather than Hegelian in their emphasis on the concrete individuality of the later Greek gods, it is because the authoritarian Hegel is working toward the demonstration that Christ the Man was superior to Zeus qua man, a proof which he could desmonstrate with out difficulty in a Christian culture. Despite Hegel's quali fied approval of Zeus as a step in the right direction, thus winning for Christianity the entire classical heritage, Hegel disapprovingly quotes these lines of Schiller as favoring Zeus (and atheism) rather than Christ: While the gods remained more human, The men were more divine. (18) 17. G. W. F. Hegel, The Philosophy of History, Willey, New York, 1900, pp. 246-48. 18. Hegel, op. cit., p. 248.</page><page sequence="14">114 S. H. Posinsky, Ph.D. Yet these words of Schiller are an incisive summary of the influence of mythology on the Greek mind, for the myths were not taken too seriously: they offered insight and freedom rather than religious and supra-human authority. Despite the long tradition which has falsified much of Greek philosophy and made Aristotle a lesser saint in the Christian Pantheon, the Greeks had no god-given religion in the Judaeo-Christian sense and they were surprisingly free of the Near Eastern burden of sin and guilt. They regarded "sin" as bad marksmanship, or as an imbalance in the psyche — a manifestation of personal shortcomings which could deprive the "sinner" of the highest intellectual and emotional development. Yet such shortcomings could not impair the cosmic balance. Religion was considered necessary as a form of social control; and Aristotle even suggested in the Politics that priests should be recruited from those who were too old for warfare or statecraft and too limited for philosophy. In brief, knowledge for the few, with Plato defining "dialectic," the highest form of education, as ' ' the discipline which will make them masters of the technique of asking and answering ques tions." (19) And for the many, indoctrination and obedience, an unquestioning education by precept, with the knowing few setting a good example for the unknowing many. Conceding the social necessity of religion, the Greeks looked to Homer and Hesiod for their political mythology. Conservative and traditional as this poetic mythology was, it nevertheless helped to liberate the Greek mind. The Greeks did not, as Hegel wrote, degrade Nature; they explored it. Unable to accept ancestor worship or a philosophy based on ancestral or supernatural dogma, they went back to nature and first causes. And the very humanity of the gods made human freedom easier, with morality being a logical rather than a supernatural necessity. 19. Plato, The Republic, Cornford translation, Oxford University Press, London, 1945, p. 255.</page><page sequence="15">Oedipal Gods and Moral Man 115 As Briffault has pointed out: No form of power or privilege in Greece ever moulded itself on the pattern of a superhuman ruler, of a god. The primitive magico-religious beliefs and rites of the Greek peoples were exactly similar to those of all other peoples. . . . The fund of magico-religious tradition was, in fact, the same in Greece as in Sumer, Babylon, or Judea. But what a universe of difference in the ultimate outcome! That immeasurable difference rests upon the circumstances that primal irrational ism in Greece never served as the foundation for constituted power, that authority was never founded upon it. . . . Olymp ian religion was not a religious faith. The Greek was scrupulous and punctilious concerning the official rites of the City's cult, about the honour and service of the City's gods. They were, much as the Roman's Dea Soma, the symbols, the banner of the Polis. Impiety towards the City gods was, by good citizens, felt to be horribly offensive in the same manner as an insult to the statue of Caesar was offensive to a Roman, or an insult to the Union Jack is offensive to an Englishman. Therein consisted the piety of the ordinary Greek citizen; but he was not religious in the sense which the epithet bears in our Oriental tradition. He was not reverent in his attitude toward the gods. ... In Greece no inevitable connection was ever apprehended between morality and religion. There were rites due to the gods and to the dead, but relations with the living were a matter of justice, not of divine command ment. ... It has been said that Homer was their Bible. That is precisely what it never was. They had no word of God, and therefore the word of man and the thought of man grew in power unfettered. (20) V It has been indicated above that the myth contains no historic data in the strict sense, and that the evolution from pre-oedipal to oedipal, and from pre-animistic to rational and naturalistic, is primarily psychic. Some cultural data may be abstracted from the myth; but it is not clear if the pattern delineated by Bachofen is valid in this instance. (21) Although 20. Robert Briffault, 'Rational Evolution, Maemillan, New York, 1930, pp. 63-65. Cf. Francis M. Cornford, From Religion to Philosophy, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1952.</page><page sequence="16">116 S. H. Posinsky, Ph.D. it has been suggested that the evolution revealed in the myth is psychic rather than cultural, the proponents of cultural evolution would hold that the myth sums up the early history — more correctly, the prehistory — of ancient Greece. In other words, the myth clearly depicts the transition from "matriarchy," democratic and agricultural, to the patriarchy of authoritarian and mobile herdsmen, until the two were finally fused in the hierarchical plough-culture from which the complex culture of the classical Greek cities emerged. Significantly, the power of the Earth-Mother declines during the myth, beginning with the androgynous Gaia, who can reproduce spontaneously and independently until she is weakened by her son and mate, Uranus. Rhea is even less powerful and less rebellious; reconciled to her fate, she is able to save Zeus only by a ruse, and at the suggestion of her parents. During this transition the patriarchal forces are at tempting to freeze the status quo, the victory over the Earth, Mothers ; and this was at last achieved by Zeus, whose wives and loves were many, and whose authority was unimpeachable and eternal. And it is in the cultural rather than the meta physical sense that Hegel's approach is valid, for the myth does represent a victory of form over substance, spirit over matter, order over fertility, male over female — in brief, a victory of property and aristocracy. The unilineal evolution postulated by Bachofen is de fient in method and proof. As indicated, myths similar to the one recorded by Hesiod may be found in many cultures ; some of these cultures are so simple that no cultural stratification or progression of the type postulated by Bachofen may be detected. It is suggested, again, that the evolution is psychic rather than cultural. On the other hand, and more empirical ly, the cultural development of Greece from the dim begin nings need not be formulated in terms of a necessary and pre-existing matriarchy but as the manifestation of a transi tion from kinship to political society, with the attendant de 21. J. J. Bachofen, Das Mutterrecht (1861), B. Schwabe, Basel, 1897.</page><page sequence="17">Oedipal Gods and Moral Man 117 velopment of private property, social stratification, money, trade, and so on. (22) Some cultural data, however, are contained in the myth, even if the unilineal evolution of Bachofen remains equivocal. Thus, Gaia and Rhea, although dehumanized and pushed back into the era before gods and men, appear to be evi dences of a prehistoric fertility cult. The last traces of these pre-Hellenic goddesses lingered on in the watered-down domestic and civic goddeses like the virginal Pallas Athene, in the fertility festivals of women which were burlesqued in the Thesmophoriazusae of Aristophanes, in the concept of the fates as women, and in the last remnants of the avenging female spirits, the Erinyes or furies, descendants of Gaia, who not only declined in power and number but were often described euphemistically as the kindly and gracious ones, the Eumenides. Even the figure of Eros, described by Hesiod as among the first of the elemental forces, became in classical times a minor figure in the Pantheon, a pink little cherub who threw darts of love and was apparently synonomous with the Roman Cupid. The change in the social status of women is brought to a historic culmination in the marital affairs of Zeus. The doings of Uranus and Cronos were relegated to a vague mythical past, or explained allegorically ; but the private life of Zeus was a contemporary fact. Brought by social necessity to a polite but tenuous 'monogamy," Zeus was per mitted to change and discard wives, to present different guises and tastes, and to carry on a series of lively affairs with lesser goddesses of the Pantheon and with mortal women. Hera is not even an echo of a primitive fertility goddess but a jealous and nagging shrew whom Zeus alternately ridicules or beats as he goes in search of extra-marital entertainment. In addition to changes in social organization, social attitudes, and religion, the myth offers some additional an thropological information. Thus, the "origin" of the flint 22. Cf. S. H. Posinsky, "Instincts, Culture, and Science," Psycho analytic Quarterly, Vol. XXVII, pp. 1-37, 1958.</page><page sequence="18">118 S. H. Posinsky, Ph.D. sickle is described, tying fertility rites to a dying god. Even in classical times the harvest was sacred to the memory of an archaic titan, Cronos; and a large symbolic sickle was used to recall the first purpose to which this implement had been put in the era before Zeus. The "history" of the flint knife was recalled even during a time of considerable metallurgical skill, and the continued use of the flint knife for ceremonial purposes and ritual slaughter indicates that these rites ante dated the development of metal. Several supplementary points remain. Zeus is in himself a trinity of divine king (father), mother, and victorious son. Christian commentators have generally denied him this di versity. If the mother role is disguised, it is revealed in the swallowing of his wife, with the incorporation being the quintessence of identification, and in his ability, hermaphro ditically, to give birth via his skull, which represents not only a displacement upward but an identification with the mother. Additional maternal qualities are supplied symboli cally by the sister-wives of Zeus, each of whom gives him a special quality or attribute. In the company of Themis, for example, he is personified as the giver of law and the pro tector of the social order. Cronos is called King in the literature (and wretch by Hesiod). Zeus is the first of the gods to be called Father. (23) Zeus and the Olympian Pantheon were probably brought to Greece by the invading pastoralists ; whereas Cronos was apparently a medicine-king of the matrilineal agriculturalists. Cronos derives his powers from his wife-mother, the Earth goddess, and he is the last of the matrilineal gods. Even after the establishment of the Pantheon, Cronos remained as a temporary king and year-god, who was honored during the harvest season, but without the orgiastic release which char acterized the Roman Saturnalia. A representative of fertility powers (i.e., of instinctual forces), Cronos, like his counter 23. The same term was applied to the Indian namesake of Zeus, Dyaus. Cf. Frazer, op. cit., p. 53.</page><page sequence="19">Oedipal Gods and Moral Man 119 part Saturn, would be symbolically unfettered during the harvest celebration. The culmination of the patrilineal victory is symbolically marked by those statues of Zeus in which he is regally seated and receiving a swaddled child from its mother. (24) A simil ar statue was erected to Cronos, except that he is veiled and is receiving a swaddled stone. On the other hand, the tradi tional concept of Uranus as Sky-Father is apparently late and rather incorrect. He is not an equal of Gaia; he is not an important feature of the creation process ; and his behavior appears transitional between the eras of androgynous fer tility and patriarchal order. An elemental abstraction, he was apparently fitted into the mythology and humanized to some degree by the poets. VI Psychoanalytically, despite the Victorian translation, the myth reads like a psychoanalyst's case book. The intensity of the incest patterns, both between siblings and among parents and children, heightens the conviction that these strong drives are an aspect of man's unconscious nature, and that such myths permit people to discuss in an objective and socially acceptable way those subjective desires which require re pression. Freud's instinct theory, and especially the polarity between aggression and Eros, has a strange counterpart in Hesiod, even if modern sociological psychiatry rejects this duality of the instincts. At any rate, Freud did restore Eros to his primeval position. Acquainted with the Cronos myth, Freud made only a passing if pointed reference to it: Cronos devours his children, as the wild boar devours the litter of the sow; Zeus emasculates his father and takes his place as ruler. (25) We may observe, in addition, that the pre-oedipal, omnipotent, 24. Cf. Jane E. Harrison, Themis, Cambridge University Press, Cam bridge, 1927.</page><page sequence="20">120 S. H. Posinsky, Ph.D. sexually undifferentiated, and androgynous mother fuses with the oedipally desirable but equally dangerous mother; that cannibalism and other body-destruction fantasies flow into castration anxieties ; that aggressive and erotic strivings are projected onto the parents and siblings; that there is a late recognition of the sexual role of the father and that this role is seen as consistently sadistic, being reinforced in this in stance by the projection of oral aggression onto the father, rather than the mother. (26) It is also clear that oedipal guilt is partially projected onto the mother, who is not only seductive but also directs the aggression against the lecherous father. As in a dream, identifications are faulty or non-existent; aggression and incest are projected onto dark parental forces, which are not completely human; and the dreamer (in this case, the listener) is offered the lesser pleasure of voyeurism (the primal scene) for the dangers of identification, partici pation, and retribution. Thus, the myth is free of intropuni tive reactions on the divine level, and yet so full of guilt and expiation on the human level, as in the Oedipus Rex of Sophocles. The gods in their incestuous strivings risk only the external reprisals which may be considered normal oc cupational hazards under the circumstances, while human be ings, who are driven along the same paths by a predestined and tragic logic (or illogic), must absolve their "errors" by self-punishment and death. If Hesiod's narrative provides less identification and guilt, it is also less awe-inspiring and cathartic than Oedipus Rex. (27) Interestingly enough, Hesiod's myth ends "happily" — much in the manner of children's tales. It is a narrative of 25. S. Freud, The Interpretation of Breams, in The Basic Writings, Modern Library edition, New York, p. 303. 26. The equation of child and stone is echoed in the pebble play of toddlers, in the delivery of stones by male shamans during a mock childbirth, and so on. Cf. Judith S. Kestenberg, "On the Development of Maternal Feelings in Early Childhood," in The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child, XI, International Universities Press, New York, p. 287.</page><page sequence="21">Oedipal Gods and Moral Man 121 "growing up." (28) Uncensored unconscious trends and desires (cannibalism, unbridled sexuality, castration, murder) run their course, to taper off with the growing up and primacy of Zeus. Although Zeus is true to his ancestry and is charac terized by aggressive and libidinal traits — that is, he is human, unlike the heroes, deities, and saints of our own tra dition — he represents a victory of the super-ego, if only the tentative victory marked by a weakening or working-out of oedipal desires. He is thus more "grown up" than his immediate ancestors, who represent instinctual forces which are not yet bridled by the super-ego. Marked by an intense acting-out, as in comic books, child ren's tales, and the like, Hesiod's poem closes with the typical "happy ending." In the more human version of the oedipal theme, recorded by Sophocles, the incestuous striv ings are partially disguised, man struggles against himself and his destiny, and the experience is strongly cathartic. VII There is another aspect of the myth which is significant, and that is the Greek attitude to this errant behavior among their highest deities, for the myth was well known to them and must seem to us a rather doubtful way of inculcating re ligion. Briffault has hedged somewhat by denying that the Olympian religion was a religion at all. It was certainly not an Oriental religion during the climactic period of Greek culture, but it was a religion nevertheless and there were sociopolitical forces which championed the traditional re ligion. Perhaps the absence of supernatural awe set up a vacuum 27. A critic of the Tyrone Guthrie production of Oedipus Bex contra dicts several thousand years of human experience and points out that the "situation is as improbable as can be written" and that "few will be able to make an emotional response to it": Archer Winsten, "^Reviewing Stand," New York Post, January 8, 1957, p. 31. 28.

Posinsky, Ph.D. which made for the easier diffusion into Greece of the Oriental mystery-religions; but these were more exclusive in their membership than the official religion of the state. The mys tery-religions, and even Plato belonged to one or more of these cults, did not compete with the traditional religion and at least in Greece conducted no soul-saving proselytism. More like secret societies, they were a supplement to the traditional religion. At any rate, the Greeks told the myths about Zeus and his ancestors with a wry humor; and numerous variants of these tales were passed along and recorded. On the basis of priority, it can be assumed that the stories of the oedipal gods inspired or made possible the free treatment of the oedipus theme on the human level. Nor was the latter always a tragic subject : there are many references in Greek comedies and satires to the theme of the old father who is severely beaten by his son — for the old man's further education, or as a retaliation for parental discipline in childhood. Such an incident is one of the high points of The Clouds, by Aristo phanes, where Socrates, teaching philosophy to a young was trel, educates him to the degree where he is able to beat his old father and at the same time prove the logical necessity for such behavior. That this parody of divine matters is in tentional can be verified by an actual reference to Zeus in the same play: "How then, if justice exists, was Zeus not put to death for having put his father in chains!" "Bah! this is enough to turn my stomach! A basin, quick!" (29) It is of interest that the question goes unanswered. Yet the bawdy private lives of the gods must seem strange (and re freshing) in comparison with our more infantile concern with the asexuality and "purity" of our heroes and deities. It is no small problem to decide whether Greek society 29. Aristophanes, The Clouds, in Oates and O'Neill, The Complete Greek Drama, Vol. II, Random House, New York, 1938, p. 577.</page><page sequence="23">Oedipal Gods and Moral Man 123 chose to tweak Zeus's nose publicly, or whether the political organization and social controls were strong enough for the classical Greeks to ignore the cohesive effects of a super natural religion. The intellectual gymnastics which beguiled the leisure class were, according to Plato, to be hidden from the bulk of the population behind a Spartan façade and a certain amount of dissimulation; and even the liberal Aristo phanes, in many ways a critic of Plato, agreed that the sophis tical selling and display of ideas were dangerous to Greek society. This double-entry system of moral bookkeeping was more scrupulously practised in the pre-Socratic era, when philosopher-poets sang mythos and the Pantheon publicly and reserved their more agnostic opinions for the private amusement of their wealthy patrons. In crude comparative terms, the Greek version of the Protestant Reformation made religion a private matter, al though, as with us, vestiges or symbols of the traditional religion were used to buttress state power and social relations. But, even as Hobbes, a bitter critic of the Roman Catholic religion, felt that the reformed churches were falling into an opposite error and fostering sedition through the commercially congenial separation of church and state, and the decline of religious mystery and awe, (30) so the conservative Plato stressed the necessity of rigid political controls and a censor ship of religion, myth, poetry, and the arts in the interest of social unity. In a sense, both men wanted a return to "divine" kingship for social reasons, whether in the person of a philoso pher-king or in the mythical concept of the absolutist state. A subtle psychologist and politician, and a champion of the vested-interests function of myth and religion, Plato read Hesiod's myth in ethico-political terms and he considered it unfit for the many, be they children or adults. Similarly, 30. Thomas Hobbes, Behemoth: "For after the Bible was translated into English every man, nay every boy and every wench that could read English, thought they spoke with God Almighty and under stood what he said. . . . Every man became a judge of religion and an interpreter of the Scriptures to himself."</page><page sequence="24">124 S. H. Posinsky, Ph.D. critics of the modern comic-books see them as conducive to acting-out, too revealing of parental behavior, and even too frightening for some adults whose repressions are weak. (31) Although Plato's letters and dialogues abound with quo tations from Homer and Hesiod, he put a damning criticism of both poets into the mouth of Socrates : "It seems, then, that our first business will be to supervise the making of fables and legends, rejecting all which are unsatisfactory; and we shall induce nurses and mothers to tell their children only those which we have approved, and to think more of moulding their souls with these stories than they do now of rubbing their limbs to make them strong and shapely. Most of the stories now in use must be discarded." "What kind do you means? . . . ." "The stories in Hesiod and Homer and the poets in general, who have at all times composed fictitious tales and told them to mankind." "Which kind are you thinking of, and what fault do you find in them?" "The worst of all faults, especially if the story is ugly and immoral — misrepresenting the nature of gods and heroes, like an artist whose picture is utterly unlike the object he sets out to draw." "That is certainly a serious fault; but give me an example." "A signal instance of false invention about the highest matters is that foul story, which Hesiod repeats, of the deeds of Uranus and the vengeance of Cronos; and then there is the tale of Cronos's doings and of his son's treatment of him. Even if such tales were true, I should not have sup posed that they should be lightly told to thoughtless young people. If they cannot be altogether suppressed, they should only be revealed in a mystery, to which access should be as far as possible restricted by requiring the sacrifice, not of a pig, but of some victim such as very few could afford." "It is true: those stories are objectionable." "Yes, and not to be repeated in our commonwealth, Adei mantus. We shall not tell a child that, if he commits the foulest crimes or goes to any length in punishing his father's misdeeds, he will be doing nothing out of the way, but only 31. Critics at the other end of the continuum regard such books as cathartic and healthful, and not conducive to acting-out.</page><page sequence="25">Oedipal Gods and Moral Man 125 what the first and greatest of the gods have done before him." (32) As in so many matters, Plato here allies himself with dis simulation, repression, and censorship. (33) VIII In conclusion, the various dimensions of a Greek myth have been analyzed. Like a dream, it reveals survivals of infancy, both of the individual and the race, and a large de gree of unconscious conflict and wish-fulfillment. Unlike a dream, however, a myth, being removed from the command of the ego, is abreactive and syntonic in function. Neverthe less, even myths touch off a social censorship by those who assume that erotic and aggressive strivings are inculcated, rather than channeled, from without. 32. Plato, op. cit., pp. 69-71. 33. A more homely opinion about the dangers of acting-out may be found in a reader's letter to the Liverpool Echo (reprinted in "This England," The New Statesman and Nation, London, Vol. LIII, No. 1350, January 26, 1957, p. 92). Criticizing a Punch and Judy stall, the writer points out: "It is noticeable that the loudest applause is when the policeman gets beaten over the head, so I feel sure that were this possible breeding ground for young criminals abolished it would be no great loss to the community."
