<plain_text><page sequence="1">Essay Three FOUR SCENES FOR POSING THE QUESTION OF MEANING Phenomenology, Form, Feeling-Body, and the Origins of Intersubjectivity To ask, "What is meaning?" is to invite general problems of self- reference. "What is meaning?" amounts to asking the meaning of meaning, presupposing thereby some of the answers one wishes to seek. The situation is not unlike the one opened by Heidegger when he asked what Being is. Strategies must be adopted when exploring the meaning of meaning that allow for the necessity of presupposing the form within which an answer will manifest as soon as the question of meaning is posed. When I first seriously attempted to explore the nature of meaning, I simply proceeded with a phenomenological analysis of meaningful action. I attempted to unveil the structures of meaningful acts as we experience them from the second, first, and third person positions. At some time during my work on this phenomenological project I realized that although I might be clarifying structures of meaningful acts through my phenomen- ological explorations, I was not answering the question of what meaning is. Certainly I was elucidating possible answers to the question, but I was also revealing new questions about meaning that cannot be answered through phenomenological modes of investigation. Therefore, when I completed a draft of my phenomenological study on meaningful acts, I became interested in the act itself of asking what meaning is. To question meaning is to act meaning- fully. My own phenomenological investigations made this abundantly clear. The question can be asked, moreover, in different ways. The question is only intelligible against some presupposed background structures, as all acts of meaning work through contrasts between foreground and background. I continued to write my manuscript, but this time I posed the</page><page sequence="2">Four Scenes 119 question of meaning against three distinctly different back- grounds. The results of my phenomenological investigations themselves had suggested alternate ways of posing the question of meaning. Three backgrounds, three additional ways in which to ask the question of what meaning is, captured my interest most strongly. Each background capable of making the question of meaning intelligible appears most immediately to me as an image cluster. The image clusters give sense and direction to the question. I adopted the word "scene" to represent the image cluster after reading Henry Staten's book on Wittgenstein and Derrida (1984), in which I found a good fit between Staten's conception of scene and my own experience of imagery when making sense of any meaningful acts. Phenomenological analysis itself is scene dependent, and my three additional investigations of meaning give a total of four scenes against which to pose the question of what meaning is. Hence the title of this essay, "Four Scenes for Posing the Question of Meaning." The essay is a condensation and partial reworking of my unpublished and unfinished book The Phenomenology of Meaningful Action. This essay has four main sections, each concerning one scene against which the question of meaning can be asked. The first scene is background to my phenomenological project. In this essay I have greatly shortened my larger work to present a mere sketch of meaningful acts from a phenomenological perspective. I do not actually investigate the background that makes my phenomenological explorations possible but rather concentrate on the phenomenological results. Portions of the background employed when doing phenomenol- ogy are revealed, sometimes implicitly, in later sections of the essay, when I discuss the relationship between my phenomenol- ogical sketch and my work within the other scenes. The next three scenes are investigated more as scenes in themselves. The nature of meaning is explored through them, but so is their very structure, partly through contrasts to the other scenes. I call the three additional scenes that are presented</page><page sequence="3">120 Essay Three subsequent to the phenomenological sketch "originary scenes" for reasons explained below. This essay should be regarded as a strategic investigation of meaning that is preliminary in nature. Because asking what meaning is amounts to asking the meaning of meaning, to presuppose from the start something of what one seeks, it is necessary to be very strategic in one's approach. I try to build arguments and descriptions along certain trajectories that can later be put into question as trajectories. A central feature of my strategy is to investigate meaning in four different ways, and to juxtapose each study with small sections of comparison and contrast introduced at appropriate moments. I say more about my general strategy in the overview. OVERVIEW A Phenomenological Sketch of Meaningful Acts My general strategy, then, consists of the following. First, I provide a rough sketch of meaningful action considered phenomenologically. I begin with our experience of receiving an impression of meaning from the act of another. Hence the second and third person positions will be taken initially as starting points. As the analysis proceeds, it becomes necessary to shift to the first person perspective and consider the experience of acting meaningfully. My larger work carefully addressed the epistem- ologica! issues raised by such a mode of inquiry and supplied much more detail about the nature of action than can be included here. For this essay I am constrained to merely present a series of selected statements without an explicit treatment of the epistemological framework from which they were derived. I can only hope these statements will appeal to the readers' own preunderstandings of action and meaning enough to regard them as plausible. Three Originary Scenes for Posing the Question of Meaning Second, from the phenomenological analysis three "originary scenes" against which to pose the question of meaning will be</page><page sequence="4">Four Scenes 121 indicated. Henry Staten used the term "scene" to indicate a meaning-imparting context, grasped holistically when a meaningful act is grasped: "A 'scene' as I am using the term might be as little as a phrase or as much as a whole culture" (Staten 1984:83) . "Originary" is a term from phenomenology that suggests a ground, foundation, or origin. The concept of an "originary scene," therefore, is that of an image cluster or image sequence capable of (1) illuminating the origin of some of the structures we discover through the phenomenological analysis of meaningful acts, and (2) casting the epistemological stance of phenomenology itself in a new light. Phenomenological analysis foregrounds description; originary scenes facilitate explanation. An originary scene is basically a paradigm in holistic form. It makes an image, an image cluster, or an image sequence foundational to a series of reflections that seek to illuminate, integrate, and explain features of experience. The experiences of concern here are those typical to meaningful action. Phenomenological analysis itself depends upon an originary scene but this dependence can only be revealed, given my chosen strategy and textual organization, after results from phenomenol- ogical analysis are presented. Moving from phenomenological analysis to the consideration of three originary scenes will help to reveal the ways in which phenomenology itself is scene- dependent. Phenomenology is not all that it claims to be; it is not simply a description of "what is." That is why the originary scenes discussed in this essay problematize the epistemology with which this essay begins. Hence the title of this essay numbers our scenes as four rather than three: the scene that underlies my phenomenological sketch and the three originary scenes un- covered by this sketch. In this essay, when I refer to "scene one," "scene two," and "scene three," I am referring to the originary scenes, in the order they appear, and not to the phenomenological sketch. "Scene one" refers to the scene of form and the flux, not to the phenomenology of meaningful acts.</page><page sequence="5">122 Essay Three Textual Syntax The three originary scenes follow the phenomenological analysis in such a manner as to generate insights into the nature of meaning given by the syntax of the four main sections of this chapter. That is, each scene explicitly explores issues that are only tacitly addressed by both the other scenes and the phenomenol- ogical analysis. Each scene is vulnerable through its dependence on a beginning, but each scene roughly addresses in an explicit way various factors necessarily implicit in the other scenes. The syntax involves moments of deconstruction, one scene often imploding the "originary" claims of the others. By moving through each scene in turn, a syntax is created that is rich with insights on the nature of meaning. One can thus picture the essay as a whole to be something like a circle of links, the connections between each link amounting to implosions. Spray from each implosion intersects with spray from the others, and insights are experienced at these intersections. Insights are guides to action and thought and may only serve originary, or foundational, purposes if one is willing to construct yet more scenes, knowing that they too could implode. The alert reader will consequently notice that the organization of this essay suggests a fifth scene, as it must: a scene I have just interpreted through the metaphors of the circle, chain links, and implosion. This is another image cluster; one that roughly determined the organization of my essay. But the idea is to understand this fifth scene as subject to the same deconstructive strategies used explicitly on the other four. Our fifth scene is not meant to be originary. Readers will understand more of this as they move through the pages ahead. Originary Scene One: Form and the Flux Each of the originary scenes I have chosen to consider appears to be at the bottom of certain discourses on meaning. One I have titled "form and the flux," which is an implicit scene in much work on the question of meaning when it is posed as a question of the relationship between a sign and its referent. The question of the relationship between a sign and its referent has generally been</page><page sequence="6">Four Scenes 123 approached through analyses of perception. Phenomenology, structuralism, and poststructuralism (as well as positivism and physicalism) have all developed their widely diverse arguments with a scene of form and the flux in the background. In the case of poststructuralist work, the "flux" (articulated in many diverse ways: "substance," "essence," etc.) is canceled. But poststruct- uralist work is nevertheless dependent on scene-one metaphorics in acknowledged, explicitly deconstructed, ways. Originary Scene Two: The Feeling-Body The next scene I consider is called "the feeling-body." This scene is more prominent in Eastern thought than in Western thought (Anandamurti 1968, 1978, 1987; Sinari 1974; Vahiduddin 1974). However, there is a contemporary literature on "embodied meaning" that presupposes scenes congruent to this one. Within phenomenology, the later work of Husserl (1970) and the writings of Merleau-Ponty (1962) both address certain portions of this scene. In ethnography, the work of Peter McLaren (1992, 1993) has been particularly insightful and promising. Thus, although this scene may appear to be the strangest of the three to most readers, that is partially because most readers will have been raised in Western cultures. Originary Scene Three: The Origin of Inter subjectivity The last scene I consider is "the origin of intersubjectivity." By intersubjectivity I am referring to prereflective structures that (1) take the existence of other subjects as a given, and (2) constitute experience through the process of position-taking with other subjects at various levels that begin with a primordial form of position-taking always already completed. Part of our sense experience of an object, for example, is the prereflective understanding that its objective features are available to other subjects much as they are to ourselves. Part of our experience of a feeling is the prereflective understanding that the feeling is not directly available to other subjects but must be indicated to them through body postures, gestures, or words. Objects and feelings are intersubjectively constituted.</page><page sequence="7">124 Essay Three Intersubjectivity is not the same as transsubjectivity. We can theoretically consider experiences that all subjects share, whether they realize that they do so or not. This would be transsubject- ivity. The transsubjective experiences need not be intersubjectively constituted. Intersubjectively constituted experiences, on the other hand, need not be transsubjective. Emotions and feelings are intersubjectively constituted as soon as they are recognized, because such recognition delivers their quality of being outside the direct access of others. Others may or may not experience identical or similar subjective states. Emotions and feelings may or may not be transsubjective, but they are intersubjective as soon as they are recognized. Intersubjectivity can be examined through the phenomenolog- ical investigation of everyday experiences of meaning but doing so continuously runs into "premonitored" action impeti that simply occur to actors in the stream of experience. That is, the impetus for a meaningful act will arise for an actor in an implicit, holistic, way, and is then either acted out or articulated into thought, or ignored for another impetus. The premonitored feature of many meaningful action impeti is an intersubjective feature; it is a part of the constitution of the actual impetus through the perspectives of a second or third person audience. If we phenomenologically examine such impeti, we discover the pregiven audience and a preanticipated set of possible responses, preconceptually understood when the impetus is understood. Meaningful action impeti, in other words, are for the most part intersubjectively constituted even before they are recognized. They are premonitored. We can ask from where such pre- understandings of audiences come, ask where the origins of intersubjective constitution might lie, but we must employ nonphenomenological modes of investigation to illuminate possible answers. The question of the origin of intersubjectivity introduces the frameworks of human ontogenesis and phylo- genesis. Both frameworks are incompatible with a strictly phenomenological method. Phenomenological strategies, moreover, depend on mental acts of recollection and reflection, which themselves appear to involve</page><page sequence="8">Four Scenes 125 preunderstood audiences if subjected to phenomenological examination. Hence for two reasons, one concerning the contents yielded by phenomenological analysis (the premonitored impetus to act) and one concerning the process of phenomenological investigation itself (the processes of audience-dependent recollect- ion and reflection), the question of meaning points toward an originary scene that is not given within the direct experience of meaningful acts. While I will treat scenes one and two as special modes of phenomenological and deconstructive investigation, I will treat scene three with an opposite sort of approach that begins with assumptions about a shared, objective world. Scene three will be limited, in this essay, to the phylogenesis of symbolic communication, ignoring important processes pertain- ing to ontogenesis. The phylogenetic scene will be sketched from two perspectives, one taking the work of George Herbert Mead (1967) as its point of departure and the other emphasizing small portions of Georg Hegel's (1967) philosophy. I rework portions of Mead's theory considerably, but attempt to present Hegel's work only for the sake of gleaning some of his important insights. A Model Finally, in my concluding section I will roughly and loosely bring things together into a model /sketch of meaningful action useful to social researchers. I have really made this last section of the essay a weak sort of gloss, referring readers to my book on critical ethnography (1996) for a tighter presentation that includes illustrations of its use and diagrams of its various components. On the one hand, this model of meaning is to be of use. I use it myself in qualitative research and teach students to use it. It lends itself to creative acts of meaning interpretation and does not prescribe procedures nor fix anything too permanently. It is a model, not a representation, of meaning. On the other hand, this model must itself be understood as an act of meaning. The model includes a self-conscious claim that it is not meant to be taken entirely at its face value. It is self-referring because it incorporates the essentially deconstructable features of</page><page sequence="9">126 Essay Three all acts of meaning within its body. It can be used to deconstruct itself, if that is what one wishes to do with it. I will suggest that the insights generated by this essay on meaning involve implicit understandings that no explicated model can fully capture and that may be used to argue against any effort to formulate a model. Yet the model itself helps to clarify the way in which the general category of "models of meaning" can be undermined, and simultaneously is useful for those whose work involves the inference and articulation of meanings. Thus, the model sketched out at the end of this chapter points both forward and backward. It is a sort of complex symbol for an implicit understanding of meaning that can be used to construct positive assertions about the nature of meaningful acts as well as to argue against any final certainty in one's conclusions. It is both highly useful and self-undermining, depending on the interests and concerns driving its appropriation. The final section of the essay, which roughly sketches out a model of meaning, is not at all meant to be an answer to the question of meaning. It does not synthesize the major arguments of this essay into a conclusion. It does not produce an end, fulfill a telos, tidy up loose strings. I emphasize this here, and will do so again at the beginning of that final section in the hope that no reader will take my final comments very seriously. What I take to be valuable in this essay is what occurs within its body. Recommended Reading Strategies This essay is very dense, and is sure to put some readers off rather quickly. I would therefore like to inform readers that my discussion of each scene can be read independently of the others. This is true, at least, minus the analyses at the end of each scene that compare the manner in which various issues appear within diverse scenes. Each major scene was written with a different style, and readers might find some of the major sections more readily intelligible than others.</page><page sequence="10">Four Scenes 127 A PHENOMENOLOGICAL SKETCH OF MEANINGFUL ACTION This section is a mere sketch of essential points that have been selected from many points that arise when considering meaningful action phenomenologically. As mentioned already, the epistemological issues associated with a phenomenological inquiry into meaningful action could not be explicitly addressed in this relatively short paper. The three scenes that follow this phenomenological exercise do illuminate epistemological issues begged here, but I do not always make this explicit. I begin the phenomenological exercise with what is common to a second and third person position with respect to a meaningful act, the positions in which one receives an impression of meaning from the act of another. I move into the first person position at an appropriate place in my list of points. 1. Meaning Is Prior to Objectivity : When observing a social inter- action or taking part in one, meaning is focal to the experience of a second or third person. Objective details of the act (what one sees, hears, possibly smells or tastes) are apperceived (ap-perceived, "perceived with," out of focus, analogous to peripheral vision in relation to the center of visual experience). Objective features of the situation are not foregrounded, they are not experienced "first" and then "decoded" for meaning. Rather, objective perceptions will only become foregrounded after the meaning of the act has been grasped, and then only if one has a purpose or project that requires such foregrounding. When one has such a project to pursue, objective factors are differentiated, via reflection, from a prior holistic experience as one set of components implicated by its meaning. If a neighbor greets you as you walk toward your car, you understand the situation holistically as a greeting. The identity of the neighbor as someone you know; the distance between you and the neighbor; the specific words used by your neighbor; the body</page><page sequence="11">128 Essay Three movements, facial expressions, and gestures of your neighbor; and all other objective characteristics of the situation are backgrounded within experience. 1.1 Perception Is Secondary to Understanding : Therefore, the question of sense perception and its relationship to meaning appears within a phenomenological analysis of meaningful acts as a second-order question. Indeed "sense perception" could be described as an effect of certain categories of internalized action, meaningful action that foregrounds an object pole in order to explicitly draw the attention of another to it. To "merely perceive" the objective features of a meaningful act addressed toward one, is but one way to internally communicate, internally act with meaning, toward an abstract audience. To explicitly notice that your neighbor has, say, thrust her arms up and out while greeting you is to internally act just after receiving her salutation. The internal act is a prediscursive form of "She has thrown out her arms" or "You have thrown out your arms." It is a communicatively structured act of noting features of the situation open to multiple access that could be allowed to evolve into a fully communicative act expressed toward a third person party or toward the woman herself. 2. Meaning Unifies the Act : Any meaningful act can be analyzed as a behavior and as such broken down into an indefinite number of sensory components, from the perspective of the second or third person. The sense perceptions of various body movements and vocalizations can be noted in this way. But these sensory components amount to part of the apperceived context of a single act. "Perceptual acts," internalized communicative acts that foreground sense experiences, can delimit apperceived sensual elements and make them thematic. But perceptual acts will either take place within a project of activity that deliberately ignores meaning as the meaningful acts of others take place, or just after meaning has been grasped through reflection. Without a project that insists on sense perception only, a meaningful act is experienced as a singularity. The singularity of the act comes</page><page sequence="12">Four Scenes 129 about through its meaning. Therefore, a meaningful act is constituted by its meaning. When your neighbor greets you with "Hello neighbor!" you experience this as a single act. Subsequent reflection could break this singularity into many discrete moments and components. But subsequent reflections are also meaningful acts with their own singular qualities. If you broke your neighbor's greeting into all its various objective components you would be engaged in a special project of some sort for some reason. If you were taking an ethnography class, for example, and were required to write down all the objective components of behaviors you encounter in your everyday life you would be engaged in a project of this kind. 2.1 An Act Has a Single Point : In the stream of action one is impressed by points made by the actors. Focal to the experience of another's meaningful act is the sense of a single overriding point. The meaning is the point from which the actor comes; where she is "coming from." As David McNeill says in his work on gesture, utterances and nonverbal speech acts move from a "primitive stage" of global, synthetic, and imagistic unity through several stages of delineation (1992:1, 20, and elsewhere). The "point" of an act is also its origin in a unitary, global, synthetically multi- dimensional meaning. McNeill uses the term "idea unit" in a similar way to my use of the term "point" (McNeill 1992:27). From the second person position, the "point" is usually grasped before any of its delineated details are explicitly understood. Even when a meaningful act is meant to have more than one meaning, as in a pun or a sarcastic remark, the multiple meanings derive from, and also deliver, a single point. The point in this case is the full pun or the full act of sarcasm. The greeting of your neighbor is experienced as having a single point. The best articulation of this point is the act itself within its full context. You could attempt to recreate it if someone asked what your neighbor's point was. You could recreate the act in its context as best you can, and see whether the one to whom you are explaining the act "gets it." But other methods of articulating the</page><page sequence="13">130 Essay Three point are always available. You can talk about the act in order to explain it to someone else; for example, "She was just being friendly, and didn't want to engage in a long talk with me." 3. The Single Point of an Act Bears Multiple Meanings : The single overriding point made by a meaningful act is holistic and implicit. It is what is first understood. One can appropriately respond to the act of another before one articulates the meaning of this other's act in either words or thought. If one does try to articulate the point of an act, one then engages in a new form of meaningful action: let's call this category of meaningful action articulation.1 And when one engages in this sort of activity, articulating the meaning of someone's act, one discovers a multitude of meanings that work together to deliver the overriding point. As said above, the most direct representation of your neighbor's greeting would be to recreate it in its full context. Articulating the meaning of the greeting as fully as possible in words, by talking about it, will delineate multiple meanings that were merely implicated by the point of the act. For example, if someone asked you to explain your neighbor's greeting you might say, "She wanted to be friendly, but not to engage in a long conversation. She seemed to suspect that I would wish to get to my car without much delay. She expected me to say 'Hi' back. She suspected that not to say 'Hello' to me would indicate that something was wrong, because we always greet each other like this outside our homes." All of these meanings, and many more, were implicated in this greeting. All such meanings are grasped at once, as the point of her act. The point of her act bore multiple meanings. 3.1 Moment-Totality, Component-Totality Relations : The multiple meanings of a single act are implicated by the overriding point 1 "Articulation" is used in this essay to refer to acts that make use of language in an effort to fully delimit meaning through a sequence of representations. "Expression," on the other hand, is used to refer to the acting out of an impetus. Expressive acts will generally contain ein articulated content that, however, is surrounded by implicit, nonarticulated, references.</page><page sequence="14">Four Scenes 131 that is experienced as a totality as well as a singularity. Each articulated meaning amounts to a "moment" or a "component," of this totality.2 The point of an act is constituted by an array of meanings. Various types of array are simultaneously involved in the constitution of meaning, and the arrays themselves could be discussed as "moments." We can examine arrays externally and internally. Externally, we can analyze a meaningful act in terms of differentiable components exhibited through the actor's behavior. Speech acts embody their meaning through the juxtaposition of the rather linear linguistic utterance with holistic, less linear, gesticulations that usually possess a more immediate relationship to the "point."3 All analyzable segments of the behavior that houses a meaningful act, such as the relationship between gesture and utterance and the relationship between semantic units, facial expression, and prosody, work together to bring about a singular impression of meaning from an array of moments and parts. Internal arrays are patterned moments and components that must be tacitly grasped in order to grasp the point of the act. These arrays structure the act's meaning rather than the behavior housing the act. There are intentions, allusions, values, norms, identities, role sets, and all sorts of structures that must be grasped simultaneously when understanding an act. 2 I will not make much of the difference between a "moment" and a "component" in this essay, but rather will just use both terms together to cover all the possibilities. A "moment" is an analytically derived aspect of meaning that depends upon the array of other moments for its special contribution or analytic sense. A "component" is an analytically derived aspect considered on its own, as if its contribution to the point of a meaningful act works externally. Usually a phenomenological analysis of meaningful acts will give us moments rather than components. But actors themselves can emphasize certain portions of a meaning array so as to give them some autonomy; to make them function as components more than moments. 3 The lack of any gesticulation in some meaningful acts usually contributes to the point of the act through the suppression of possible gesticulations. Both actor and those addressed or observing the act understand the lack of gesticulation as an absence that contributes to the meaning. The absence of gesticulation would generally work as a positive reference within the internal arrays that constitute the act's meaning.</page><page sequence="15">132 Essay Three External arrays, when analyzed, give clues to the internal arrays. Consider the following meaningful acts from your neighbor: a) She says "Hello" in a drab tone of voice without much body movement b) She says "Hello" loudly and with sharp, short, tones, hands on hips c) She says "Hello-ooo!" with arms outstretched. Each act has a different point and the difference between these various meanings could be explained after the fact and through analysis and reflection, partly by drawing attention to the different, objectively discernible, moment-totality relations, or component-totality relations involved. Saying "Hello" with hands on hips differs from saying "Hello" with hands flung outwards. The difference in the array of behavior houses a difference in array of meanings. The point of (a) could be, "I'm polite but don't much like you." The point of (b) could be, "I am angry with you; I expect some- thing from you." The point of (c) could be, "You don't seem to like me but I am friendly just the same, and I will not give up on you; you should be friendly to me too; I am not angry with you even though you don't treat me well." 3.2 Many Possible Moments and Components : There are always many ways to articulate a single impression of meaning received from the act of another. Grasping a single overriding point does not result in a single way of articulating the meaning of an act in words or gestures. Each articulation is an interpretation since each articulation casts the overriding point somewhat differently. Articulations never exhaust the point; they always seem partial.</page><page sequence="16">Four Scenes 133 If your neighbor greets you with "Hello guv'nor/' using inflections that reference sections of the British working class (when your neighbor is American) while tossing her head slightly from side to side, how would you articulate the point of her act? Perhaps: "She is being friendly and humorous. She is expressing affection. She doesn't expect me to engage in long conversation, but just laugh and say 'Hi' back." Okay, but is that all? "Well, also, she is referencing an interaction we had yesterday when I said, 'How's it going, Doc?', and she is expressing some intimacy, or a desire for a little intimacy between us." Anything else? "Well, yes, but it's hard to put into words. If I see her tomorrow and say, 'Hello, Doc' again, that would miss the point. I think that this is supposed to sort of close off something I started yesterday. Next time we meet, I should stop and talk with her a little. An invitation is involved. And there is more but I can't really articulate it all. I'm not even sure she would agree with me about all of what I've just said." The point of a meaningful act can be articulated in many ways, each of which is partial and each of which interprets. 4. Meaning as Forestructure : Each possible articulation one could produce to explain the meaningful act of another, however, may be roughly judged as adequate or inadequate. The overriding point of the act is a forestructure from which articulations may be made. A "forestructure" is a "sketch-in-advance" of the articula- tion; it is a pragmatic horizon that bounds possible articulations. The boundaries are not, however, explicit or distinct. They are like a horizon in that they recede if you try to pursue them or delineate them, for doing so amounts to trying to articulate the boundaries and this casts forth new forestructures. The relationship of forestructure to meaning is somewhat analogous to the relationship between a generative grammar and the infinite variety of sentences it makes possible.4 But we must 4 This relationship of forestructure to meaning is also analogous to the relationship of "rules of well formedness" to "strings" in number theory. See Hofstadter 1979:181-3.</page><page sequence="17">134 Essay Three take this similarity only as an analogy. For reasons presented below, meaning is in some senses identical to forestructure. Both the "rules" and the "content" constituting a meaningful act are claimed together and embodied in the act itself. To understand the greeting made by your neighbor is to have forestructures from which to act or think. The many various articulations you could formulate of the meaning of your neighbor's greeting are so many ways of filling in foresketches. When you do articulate the meaning of your neighbor's act, thereby interpreting it, you have some sense of how accurate your interpretation is. You probably would not interpret the greeting by saying: "She wants me to change my trousers," unless something within your personal history with this neighbor and something about your trousers, known to you, would suggest that interpretation. When you do attempt to give an accurate articulation of the point of her act you are able to tell roughly how close or far off you are: "She wants some intimacy in our relationship. Well, not exactly intimacy, but something like that." The point you have grasped provides you with forestructures that will guide your efforts to articulate the act's meaning and provide a sort of standard by which to judge the accuracy of your articulations. 5. Meaning and Uncertainty : The meaning of an act must be uncertain for two reasons: (1) it is uncertain in that it is a forestructure from which many interpretations are always possible, though bounded. It is implicit and only suggestive of modes of explication, not determinate of them. (2) Meaning is also uncertain because one is never sure one has the correct impression of the overriding point. Often one notes two or more possible points. Sometimes one feels subjectively certain that one understands the point of an act but then alters this impression when observing a subsequent act. Understanding a meaningful act is not a certain affair even though experiencing the act as a singularity suggests a single point. No articulation will capture or exhaust its point completely. Moreover, one is usually faced with several possible points.</page><page sequence="18">Four Scenes 135 So, to return to the example of your neighbor's greeting, it is quite possible that you would explain her act with something like the following: "She is expressing good intentions, and maybe also making a ploy for a little more intimacy between us. But maybe not. Perhaps she is just being friendly and is not seeking any greater familiarity between us. I am not absolutely sure." This explanation provides two different possible points. 6. Subjectivity and Uncertainty : The uncertainty that accompanies the understanding of meaningful acts is partially structured by subjectivity; by the condition that the actor has access to portions of her act to which the one addressed does not have access. The subjective state of the actor is indicated by her act of meaning and yet closed off from certain knowledge. This is generally understood prereflectively. It is often the main principle that generates the experience of several possible points to an act of meaning. Each possible point is distinguished from the others by possible experiences the actor might be having of her own act that are closed off from the direct access of the one acted toward. The subjective/objective distinction rests upon a distinction between privileged and shared access. Getting an impression of the meaning of an act includes getting an impression of the subjective experience of the actor. You might feel certain that your neighbor is expressing friendly feelings toward you but not be sure whether a bid for greater intimacy is part of the point or not. This gives us two possible points, both singular in nature but both analytically differentiated only by the question of how the actor is experiencing her own act. 6.1 Meaning as Impetus : Thus, the overriding point of an act includes an impression of the impetus that stirred the actor to act. The overriding point of the act of another amounts to a grasp of the "primitive form" of the act (McNeill 1992:33) as the first person experiences it prior to, and /or during, its external or internal "evolution" (McNeill 1992:40). The actor has access to the impetus of the act in ways that the observer does not. But an impetus to act is experienced from the first person position in an</page><page sequence="19">136 Essay Three implicit and holistic way. It is a fusion of motivating feelings and preconceptually grasped anticipations of the nature of the act and the consequences the act will bring about. Let's say someone asks you what your neighbor meant when she greeted you. The most direct way to get the meaning across is to find a similar impetus within yourself and act it out. If the person you are trying to explain the situation to shares as much context with your neighbor as you do, attempting to repeat the act would most closely capture the meaning by directly acquainting this person with the original act's impetus (as you grasped it). "What did she mean when she said 'Hello-ooo!'?" "She meant 'Hello-ooo!'" 6.2 An Impetus Is Not an Intention : The observer may note features of the impetus to act that the actor tried to suppress or was not conscious of, and convincingly point these out to the actor. An impetus is not the same as an intention. For example, one can act while feeling fear, tones of which are featured into the impetus and are noted by the observer but unacknowledged by the actor. In addition, one can act out an impetus that feels inappropriate to what one intends. An "intention" is a secondary structure: the result of internally monitoring an impetus to act, a result of its "internal evolution" (McNeill 1992:40). An intention seems to be the degree to which an actor invests herself in the impetus to act. Meaningful action impeti reference intentions but are not directly constituted by them. Intentions are like a learned language that is greatly malleable but never identical with what we call agency. The actor's intentions are referenced by acts as one portion of a set of claims. If your neighbor says "Hello" with sharp tones and hands on hips, you might believe something is wrong. You say back, "What's going on, Mary? Are you angry with me?" It is possible that she could then answer, "Oh, no! Sorry! I didn't intend to sound that way. I'm glad to see you but I am furious about a phone call I just received from my 'ex.'" The impetus of the act</page><page sequence="20">Four Scenes 137 was not the same as the actor's intention, and in this case portions of the impetus were actually at odds with the actor's intention. As another example, if your neighbor greeted you with "Hello guv'nor," you could ask her, "Are you bidding for a little more familiarity between us with your greeting?" An answer of "yes" or "no" would influence your interpretation of the original greeting by giving you more certainty about her own experience of her act. If she said "yes" or "no" you might decide that you have learned what her real intentions were in acting toward you. The real case, however, is probably that she has simply invested herself within one impetus as opposed to another. The intention is a claim carried by an impetus rather than a fact. Instead of saying "yes" or "no," for example, she might reply to your question with: "Well, I'm not sure. I did feel unusually warm toward you when I greeted you." The impetus of a meaningful act, as experienced by the actor, is not identical with the intention of the actor. An intention is a claim when considered from the second or third person positions, and it is an investment when considered from a primordial first person position. 7. Impetus as , Forestructure - Acts Interpret Their Own Point : An impetus to act is experienced by the first person, the actor, much as the forestructure of the impression of meaning is experienced by the one trying to articulate the point of an act, or to act back appropriately. It is a forestructure for the actor as well as for those addressed by, or observing, the act. An actor can experience an impetus to act just prior to acting, but only in an implicit, holistic, preconceptual, manner. Acting from the impetus is a way to interpret it; to fill in a foresketch. That is why we sometimes surprise ourselves during or just after acting, why we often feel more clear about the meaning of our impeti after acting from them. Acts interpret their point. Let's imagine that your neighbor says, "Hello guv'nor" with an imitated British working class accent and slight tossing of the head. You get the point as including friendliness, affection, and humor.</page><page sequence="21">138 Essay Three Now the analysis will shift from her act to your experience of your own act back. You experience an impetus to act back that has forestructures calling for a similar accent and a similar use of vernacular terms. You find yourself acting to fill in this foresketch but what comes out is "Toodle pop! I mean pipi Toodle pip!, ha ha." You surprise yourself first of all because the form "toodle [pip]" comes out, which is perhaps close enough to the form of the foresketch but a phrase alluding to the wrong British social class. You surprise yourself secondly because "pop" was actually spoken within the form instead of "pip." So you probably feel a little clumsy and awkward. The impetus was appropriate, but the explicit act was not, for two reasons (wrong social class referenced, and wrong word spoken). The impetus was a forestructure that you incorrectly filled in. 8. Meaning as Impeti to Act Again : Meaningful action impeti have the quality of forestructures. Impressions of the point of a meaningful act made by another also have the quality of fore- structures. This is no mere coincidence because the meaning one understands from the act of another appears to be an array of impeti for new acts. The impression of the point of an act made by another is an impetus cluster for new acts of our own. The forestructure of the impression of meaning is in some sort of relationship to the forestructure of the original act. From the third person position, the impression of meaning that an observed act yields is a set of impeti for articulating the point; talking about the meaning of the act. From the second person position the impression of meaning one receives from the act of another is usually an impetus to respond appropriately to the act; a forestructure of acting back toward the actor. All such impeti to act again have the quality of forestructures and therefore do not prescribe acts of response or acts of articulation in their details. They rather provide various horizons for acting again. Once you grasp the point of your neighbor's greeting, or decide on one of several possible points, you are in a position to act in three categorically different ways. You have forestructures on</page><page sequence="22">Four Scenes 139 hand to respond back to the neighbor, to talk about the greeting, and to imitate the greeting. Action impeti are on-hand. Your grasp of the point consists of impeti to act yourself. 8.1 Meaning as Acting Again within Three Modes : The impression of meaning received in either second or third person position allows for three categories of acting again. One can (1) repeat the act as the first person acted it, (2) respond to the act appropriately as the second person would usually do, (3) articulate the act in thought or words as a third person would do. From these three primary categories of "acting again," or understanding an act, come various secondary categories of acting again; for example, deliberately responding inappropriately. Your neighbor says "Hello." To grasp the point of this greeting is to understand the forestructures of imitating her act, respond- ing to her with something like "Hi," and telling someone else what she said and what it meant. All three modes are involved in grasping the point of the act. Your grasp of the act is an impetus cluster. You might not be able to fill in the various foresketches skillfully, but you understand their basic form. 9. Action Monitoring : As one acts meaningfully, one monitors the act from various perspectives: as the person addressed by the act might experience it and as various abstract or concrete, present or absent audiences might experience it. If your neighbor says "Hello" and you respond with "Hi," as you respond you gain impressions of your own act as others might experience it. As you say "Hi," in a friendly manner, you probably gain an impression of how your neighbor will experi- ence your returned greeting. You probably also gain a view of the act from the perspective of an uninvolved observer. When you said, "Toodle pop!" you probably realized that you had the wrong word while it was being uttered from your mouth. Your ability to monitor your act allowed you to experience it as others would, notice that the wrong word was used, and quickly act again to remedy the situation.</page><page sequence="23">140 Essay Three 9.1 Action Impetus Monitoring : The impetus to act meaningfully can also be monitored, without acting the impetus out. Action impeti: a) can be partially rehearsed in thought, instead of acted upon (activity proceeding from a first person perspective on the impetus, but in first person thought) b) can be partially considered in thought as it would impress the one addressed by the act (activity proceeding from a second person perspective on the impetus, but in first person thought), and c) can be partially considered in thought as it would appear to a general but absent audience (activity proceeding from a third person perspective on the impetus, but in first person thought). In other words, the impetus itself can be "monitored," considered within one's privileged realm of experience, from a first, second, and third person position, through a mental rehearsal. This can occur through an indefinite number of levels of explicitness. That is, the act can be rehearsed with all the words thought out, or with a few words thought out and images or feelings representing the rest of the act, or solely in terms of images and feelings. Your impetus to respond to the neighbor can be inwardly "rehearsed," so as to monitor its partial, internalized, expression. This can occur at very low levels of explicitness, in which some preanesthetic sensations and vague imagery emerge within your subjective realm of privileged access. It can also occur at fairly explicit levels in which the words you would use actually take form in thought - you might even subvocalize them. You could also adopt a third person perspective on your impetus, allowing it to be expressed as an observer would perceive it. And you could also adopt the second person position to imagine your act as the neighbor might experience it.</page><page sequence="24">Four Scenes 141 9.2 Monitoring as New Impeti Differentiated from an Original Impetus : Monitoring an act is not a process by which a free consciousness observes and considers an act, but rather the eruption of new impeti to act that are differentiated from an original impetus. Monitoring often begins while an impetus is in the process of being acted out or mentally rehearsed. As an impetus evolves into action, one can experience new impeti in relation to portions of the forestructure of the original impetus. These new impeti are often chained. One can, for example, experience the sort of impetus to act back that the person addressed by one's act may feel and then, in chained formation, experience an impetus to respond to that anticipated response (i.e., before one has completed one's act and thus before the person addressed has acted back). One can experience an impetus that corresponds to the remarks about your act that a nonaddressed observer might make, and then experience a chained impetus to act in relation to those virtual remarks. Thus one often experiences an impetus to act just after completing an action in order to forestall an anticipated misunderstanding, to receive anticipated affirmation, to support a portion of the forestructure against which an objection is expected. But all such new impeti differentiate from the original impetus in a preconceptual manner and prior to the articulation of such categories as "objection," "affirmation," "misunderstanding." Your neighbor says, "Hello!" in sharp, short, tones and with hands on hips. You respond with, "Well! hello!" in an equally angry manner. But as this comes forth you monitor it from a third person perspective that you commonly assume and with respect to which you usually construct your identity. Your response seems mean and totally lacking in high-mindedness from this perspective. So you immediately act again, as soon as your angry response is finished. You now say, "Oh, sorry Mary, I'm not really angry with you. Why are you angry with me?"</page><page sequence="25">142 Essay Three 9.3 Premonitored Action Impeti : A great many action impeti have a premonitored quality. They are constituted by the expected impressions they will make on the one addressed and on observers. Actual monitoring processes that take place during the course of expressing an act or during the course of a mental rehearsal clarify the premonitored moments of the original impetus. When your neighbor says, "Hello-ooo" and you respond by laughing and saying "Well, hello-ooo," it is as if you are acting out one part of a play. Your act has an audience already built into it. It is premonitored. Premonitored action impeti are related to the concept of "typifications" discussed in other sections of this essay. 10. Interactive Syntax and the Temporal Horizon : The impression of meaning one receives from the act of another depends in part on the action that has occurred just before, and the action that is expected to occur just after. Interactions possess a syntax. From the second and third person positions, the impression of meaning includes an impression of how the impetus is experienced by the actor in light of what occurred just prior to the act. The actor refers to prior action with the present act. The reference to prior action is part of the constitution of the act, part of its point. From the first person position, monitoring occurs with the eruption of new impeti that are temporally differentiated from the act in progress. A second act of clarification, for example, references the first act. Even a second act that seems to radically "change the subject" takes an important part of its meaning in relation to the act just completed. This amounts to a syntax of interaction, foreshadowed holistically as a temporal horizon to the act. The syntax of interaction is a syntax of "points" and is autonomous from other levels of syntax, such as the syntax characterizing languages; sign languages, and verbal language interspersed with language-like gestures, pantomimes, and emblems (McNeill 1992:37). The syntax of interaction itself involves moment-totality relationships: from the first person perspective, the point of a single act bears</page><page sequence="26">Four Scenes 143 relation to a "project" in which possible sequences of future acts are referenced holistically; from the second and third person positions an impression of meaning will include a holistic grasp of the "project" through which the actor constructed her particular act. Your neighbor says, "Hello guv'nor." You respond with "Toodle pop; I mean, toodle pip, ha ha." Your neighbor now says, "Ha ha, so what's new, friend?" The meaning or point of this last act is highly dependent on the temporal syntax. Your neighbor has made light of your unskilled response and changed the style of interaction, thereby communicating full acceptance and friendly intentions. References to the previous two acts are constituents of the third act. Your neighbor also indicates an expectation that you will respond again but probably within the new, nonhumorous, style she introduced. References to immediately past actions and to expected future actions partly constitute the point of her last act. A syntax of interaction is a constituent reference within the point of the meaningful act. The neighbor's project initially appeared to be that of a short series of humorous, affectionate interactions. It changed slightly with her last act, the project now being that of maintaining a short series of friendly and affectionate interactions but without the humorous style. 11. The Spatial Horizon of the Act : The impression of meaning one obtains from the act of another is also related to the physical and social surroundings within which the act takes place. Part of the impression of meaning is an impression of how the actor construes the act in relation to the physical setting in which it takes place. The spatial horizon of an act forms one realm of pragmatic reference, one region of the moments unified by the point of an act and a project of action. You can expect your neighbor to be aware of the fact that you are outside your home and moving toward your car. How your neighbor construes the spatial features of your interaction will be an important part of how you understand her. Her construal will either be referenced in her act or not. If she says, "Hi! Back to the</page><page sequence="27">144 Essay Three rat race I see," you could take it that she has noticed your movement toward the car. If she says, "Hi! What did you think of the President's speech?" while moving slowly toward you, you could assume that she is giving little significance to your movement toward the car. You might then place a hand on the car door while saying, "Gruesome! Catch you later." 12. The Impetus Prior to the Act : An impetus to act meaningfully can be experienced prior to acting it through, monitoring it, or thinking explicitly about it. One can become aware of several possible impeti to act, for example, and act on one impetus rather than its alternatives. One can become aware of an impetus to act meaningfully and of its alternatives, without monitoring it or contemplating it. One can become aware of an impetus to monitor an act in progress without allowing its expression. One can bring an impetus to act to the threshold of acting it out, without then crossing over that threshold into activity.5 You could experience an impetus to respond to your neighbor with "Hi," but feel in such a great hurry as to ignore this impetus and simply rush to the car. You could experience an impetus to justify your use of the word "pop" instead of "pip" by explaining that you had been thinking of soda pop just before the greeting. But instead of expressing this impetus, you inwardly monitor it from the second person position and experience it as unnecessary and too defensive, so you do not express it. You could experience an impetus to keep thinking about your response to the neighbor, so as to uncover more possible "points" readable from your act, but pull your attention back to concentrate on what your neighbor will do next. In all of these cases, action impeti are experienced prior to their 5 1 will not elaborate this point, but the alert reader will notice that it is a feature of the phenomenological method for examining action impeti. This assertion thus begs questions directly associated with the epistemology of a phenomen- ological inquiry. Phenomenological reflection appears to be a specialized form of what I have been calling the "monitoring" of action impeti.</page><page sequence="28">Four Scenes 145 expression and something like a choice is made whether to express them or not.6 12.1 Preconceptual Awareness of the Impetus : An impetus to act meaningfully will arise within awareness in a preconceptual way. It will first arise as a forestructure that may then result in either gross motor activity, or in monitoring activity (internal considerations from first, second, or third person positions), or in a newly foregrounded alternative impetus. Such awareness is preconceptual in that the impetus to act meaningfully will be that of a forestructure; a holistic, implicit, and in this sense pre- understanding of the act entailed by the impetus and of the consequences possible from a manifestation of this act. The examples given just above included rushing to the car instead of saying "Hi," waiting for your neighbor's response instead of justifying your own misuse of words, and concentrating on your neighbor instead of thinking through all the possible meanings of your previous act. Each involved a quick, preconceptual, holistic, awareness of an impetus followed by a sort of choice. The impetus in each case was experienced in synthesized images and body sensations. The awareness was preconceptual. 12.2 Preconceptual Awareness as Feeling-Configuration : The impetus to act meaningfully can be phenomenologically examined as it first emerges in awareness. This is thematizing; "freezing," the impetus within awareness and examining its appearance. When this is done one discovers an impetus to be a feeling-configuration 6 I write "something like a choice" in this sentence because the concept of "choice" is rather dicey. Very often the word "choice" is used to mean making a decision after a process of careful reflection. I am trying to capture a process that usually occurs without deliberation such that the impetus "of most experiential weight" is acted from. Whether we would wish to call this a sort of low level choice or call it something else is an issue on which I am as yet undecided. The section on George Herbert Mead explores some of the issues related to this question.</page><page sequence="29">146 Essay Three that is constituted by moment-totality relations on the level of feelings and images.7 Your neighbor begins to describe, at length, an article she read earlier that day. You experience an impetus to interrupt, explaining that you need to get going. You do not express it, and rather than listen to your neighbor, examine the impetus. There is a sensation in your right arm and hand, which would have moved up toward your neighbor in a "stop" or "halt" sign had the impetus been expressed. There are sensations in your throat and mouth which would have uttered, "Sorry, need to go." Your head was about to shake back and forth and you can feel sensations there as well. This would have been one act; the words and body movements would have been expressed in a coordinated manner. Vague imagery represents the act as a whole and is somehow experientially close to the body sensations. Stopping the impetus and retaining awareness of it first delivers a general impression of the singular point to be made, felt in the body. Second comes the configuration of sensations distributed about the body. 12.3 Three Shades of the Feeling-Configuration : An impetus to act meaningfully, if frozen preconceptually for examination, displays a configuration of body sensations, a mode of I-feeling, and preimagery. a) The configuration of body sensations is a form of proprioception (Heil 1983): awareness of a state of sensation located within the body. Included in these sensations are what I call "prekinesthetics": sensations in those regions of the body that would move when the impetus is expressed. A "tight feeling" about the stomach, a certain awareness of the lips and cheeks, an "expanded feeling" in the chest, are all examples. 7 This idea is related to, though not identical with, Merleau-Ponty's discussion of "preobjectivity" and body sensations. See Merleau-Ponty 1962, Introduction and Chapter One.</page><page sequence="30">Four Scenes 147 b) The I-feeling mode is revealed as closer to the actual impetus than the proprioceptive configuration. The latter differentiates within awareness as multiple sensations that, however, are linked or patterned in relation to the singularity of the impetus. The former, the I-feeling mode, is what unifies the proprioceptive configuration. It differentiates within awareness prior to the proprioceptive configuration. It is just prior to awareness of bodily sensation. It is a singularity, a way of being, an implicit identity. It is like ripples on a surface of water in that it is already going away when one becomes aware of it. It appears as the fading sensation of a former fusion of awareness and impetus. c) Preimagery is also a part of the preconceptual awareness of an impetus to act meaningfully. It is pre-imagery because it is suggestive of visual images without focus, rather like peripheral vision or some forms of dream imagery. If made focal it takes on more definite boundaries but is still not as distinct as a concrete visual experience. It is felt. It contains "places" for the actor and those to be acted toward. The preunderstandings of both the act and a social context surrounding the act are included. Preimagery contains all this holistically, preconceptually, and as a mode of feeling rather than as a focal image.8 You are walking toward your car, you notice your neighbor within your peripheral vision, you hear her greeting, and you simultaneously understand the point of her greeting. Here is a possible impetus you might next experience in frozen form: 8 David McNeill (1992) believes that an "image" arises within the subjective realm first, which, one could assume, represents the meaning of the forthcoming act true to its holistic origins if drawn or otherwise directly represented. However, fully explicit images do not precede acts within the consciousness of the actor. Rather, a special form of acting (externally or internally) from the same impetus would be required to make an image explicit. Thus my use of the term preimagery.</page><page sequence="31">148 Essay Three * A sort of tightened sensation along the side of your body nearest to your neighbor. * A set of proprioceptive sensations that could be called preanesthetic, felt in those portions of your body that would move if the impetus were to be expressed. These correspond to movements that would turn your head and trunk toward your neighbor while starting to speak. Many parts of your body serve as locations to these sensations. * Some preimages associated with the above feelings that involve the movements that would come and the words that would be uttered. These preimages represent the movements that correspond to your act and the way the act would appear to your neighbor and others if they were observing. They are preimages because they are out of focus and abstract rather than vivid or concrete. * A deeper sensation that grounds the unitary, singular, quality of the above sensations and imagery. This is a way of being through the act associated with this impetus. This is a sense of yourself as embodied within this one act. This is the I- feeling mode. All together, this is a configuration because it consists of many parts unified by the singularity of the impetus. The experience of a unity is given through the "deeper sensation" mentioned just above - the "I feeling mode." 13. Impetus as Symbol of a Symbol : To examine the impetus of a meaningful act we had to freeze a preconceptual awareness and then phenomenologically examine it. This means that preconcep- tual awareness had to be made thematic. As soon as it is described as a proprioceptive configuration, preimagery, and an I-feeling mode, it becomes conceptual. This was a phenomenological strategy but it was a process that itself adds to the construction of what is revealed in awareness.</page><page sequence="32">Four Scenes 149 The feeling-configuration emerged with its three components - proprioceptive and prekinesthetic configuration, I-feeling mode, and preimagery - as something that points toward what was prior. What was prior was a single I-feeling state in which awareness was fused with an impetus to act. Thus it becomes "frozen" for examination, thematized, only by becoming a symbol for a prior state. What I am calling "impetus" is therefore a symbol, for it points backward to what was but is going-gone. It points backward to the singularity of the impetus to act. It sug- gests a prior fusion of awareness and impetus that has just broken apart through taking the phenomenological stance. If we contemplate the singularity of the impetus, rather than its differentiated parts (proprioceptive configuration, etc.), we find ourselves contemplating a memory. There was an impetus, within which our awareness had been fused. This impetus is yet another symbol. It is a state of fusion in which awareness and impetus to act were one and yet were pointing forward toward the act. There are two symbols: one of a state already going-gone, and one of an act to come. Both symbols are inhabited by desires. The discovery of the feeling-configuration symbol amounts to the discovery of a "pointing backward" that is a desire to recollect what just was; the state of fusion. The suggestion of the fusion state comes next, as a product of recollection. As such we find a symbol of what will come if we freeze things no longer but surrender to the impetus and allow it to act through us. This second symbol, which comes to us as being prior to the feeling-configuration symbol of which we became aware first "points forward" not as a desire to recollect but as a desire to surrender and allow the act to manifest itself. Each impetus has its particular desire, or promise. One is constituted by the desire to recollect a former state, the other is constituted by the desire to fulfill a telos promised by the original impetus to act. Consider the impetus to tell your neighbor that you have to go, you cannot listen to her description of an article or a speech because you don't have time. Phenomenologically freezing this impetus allows an inner examination that reveals the body</page><page sequence="33">150 Essay Three sensations, the preimagery, and the I-feeling mode described in a section above. These various moments and components point back to an original unity, and it is the I-feeling mode that captures that unity most closely. But the original unity itself is not revealed by your phenomenological investigation. That unity would have allowed for no phenomenological investigations because your whole being was fused within its moment. There were no differentiations that could have supported both the impetus and your awareness of this impetus. Thus the configuration of sensations, preimagery, and I-feeling mode represents a moment gone by. The configuration is a symbol pointing back to a lost moment. Through the I-feeling mode it is possible to retrieve something like the original impetus to either act out the impetus or to continue the phenomenological process. The impetus is a symbol of the act it would give rise to: interrupting your neighbor. A desire is intrinsic to it. All impeti symbolize what would come, if they are acted out, and all are inhabited by a desire to act. Thus, thematizing them reveals a symbol that points forward, yet the thematized components and moments are not really the impetus. They can only be, in configuration, a symbol pointing back. 13.1 Symbol as Desire : The impetus to act was a state of desire, a mode of desire. It was a symbol that we find as such only through a second symbol with its own mode of desire: the desire to recollect the former symbol. Phenomenological strategies will always amount to the differentiation and objectification of a prior state and thus to a recollection that is conducted with its own forestructures, its own modes of desire. When applied to an impetus to act the resulting object of awareness is also a desire; a desire to move forth in action. Desire is in both cases fused with a mode of I-feeling. In such a state one feels a certain promise. The preunderstanding of what is to come is a promise, a temptation, an anticipation within which an I-feeling is embodied.</page><page sequence="34">Four Scenes 151 14. The Point Behind Is a Vanishing Point : The effort to phenomen- ologically recollect the point of an act by reflecting on the impetus gives us only symbols of symbols. Moreover, when we are aware of the symbol pointing forward as it is given to us in phenomenological investigation, we find it differentiated in our experience only through the projection of new forestructures: those provided by a new impetus, a new desire attributable to the processes of reflection and recollection. When we are phenomenologically aware of an impetus as the symbol pointing forward we have already interpreted it against a new set of concerns. We have "looked backward" at the point behind the feeling-configuration symbol but cannot see or feel in an immediate way what is there. It appears as an anticipation, a desire, but is interpreted only through a new mode of anticipating and desiring. Efforts to reflect further in order to purify the point behind only produce yet more forestructures. Trying to look backward amounts to new modes of acting forward: acting forward internally. The point behind is a "vanishing point." We never have an impetus to act purely within our conscious awareness. 15. The Point Ahead Is a Vanishing Point : Thus, to summarize and extrapolate: The meaning of an act is holistic and implicit. It is a forestructure from which to act, an impetus to which the actor surrendered. It is a forestructure from which to act again. The actor surrenders to an impetus but often also monitors and alters it while acting. The actor clarifies the impetus through the act. But the actor is left only with new impeti at the end of the act because clarification turns out to be but an extended repertoire for acting again, only an alteration in the actor's present concerns, desires, and not a final explication of the meaning of the act as such. Those who observe the act and are addressed by the act understand the meaning only through new impeti to act again from their respective positions, one of which might be the impetus to talk about the meaning of the act. The clarification of the meaning of an act for second and third persons is only an alteration in their</page><page sequence="35">152 Essay Three concerns and their modes of desire constituting new possibilities to act. The point of an act is a vanishing point for the actor; never fully and finally explicable as such through acting. Or, to say it otherwise, "explication" means alterations in one's present concerns, one's possibilities for moving on with activity. Among the new possibilities are ways in which the point just made could be "recollected" as a restatement of the meaning. But this involves new forestructures, new interpretations. The point of an act is a vanishing point for the second and third persons; never explicable as such through responding to it with an effort to fully articulate its meaning nor with an effort to provide an appropriate response to the actor. Or, to say it otherwise, one "understands" another when one feels able to carry on with acting in relation to her, or one feels capable of speaking about the other's act with words. From all perspectives, the point of a meaningful act is a vanishing point. It is a reference to an almost thinglike form that can never be apprehended as such. Three Originary Scenes Suggested from the Phenomenological Sketch The above phenomenological sketch is meant to be nothing more than a rough outline. It allows me, however, to pose the question of meaningful action against my three originary scenes in a more precise manner. 1) Form and the Flux : How is it that we can become preconcept- ually aware of an impetus to act? When we become aware of an impetus to act we are aware of a symbol; a desire to recollect. When we recollect we become aware of a prior symbol that is a state of desire pointing forward as a state of anticipation. It is a symbol of what is to come. Each symbol is a "form"; a sort of preobject to awareness with boundaries; forestructures. How do forms arise before awareness and what is their nature? How is it possible to be aware of form and what is awareness? What is prior</page><page sequence="36">Four Scenes 153 to form, what is "flux"? Asking these questions amounts to asking about meaning against the scene of form and the flux. 2) The Feeling-Body : How is it that an impetus to act, and thus a meaning in its implicit, holistic state, involves a proprioceptive configuration? What is the relationship between a proprioceptive state and what I have called the "I-feeling mode"? What is an I- feeling? What is the relationship between desire, I-feeling modes, and proprioception? To ask these questions is to pose the question of meaning against the scene of the feeling-body. 3) The Origin of Intersubjectivity: What makes possible our capacity to act out an impetus from first, second, and third person positions? The preimagery of the impetus includes a pre- understanding of an entire social situation: how is this possible? The uncertainty of the impression of meaning one gains from the act of another is rooted in the ability to sort of imagine the experience of an impetus to act from the first person position when in the second or third person position. How is this possible? The state of desire which is the impetus to act includes a promise, a preunderstanding of how one will feel after an act that is dependent on the responses that others will provide to the act. This suggests a preunderstanding of the act's audience. How is this possible? To ask these questions is to pose the problem of meaning against the origins of intersubjectivity. ORIGIN ARY SCENE ONE: FORM AND THE FLUX Form and Perception The scene of form and the flux goes something like this: Imagine a chaotic, patternless, flux in which no form, no differentiations of any kind, are distinguishable. A lone subject somehow comes to perceive an orderly world, inclusive of both "outer" and "inner" forms and inclusive of the specifics of this subject's own nature. How does form emerge from the flux? Once we can understand the way in which form is perceived and known, we can accordingly analyze how signifiers, such as words, come to stand for, or represent, form. This scene is</page><page sequence="37">154 Essay Three generally arrived at through considerations of the relationship between signifiers and "forms," which then lead to the question of what form itself consists of and what makes it possible. According to Staten (1984:5), "form" has been taken to be the primary connection between being and knowledge of being in most Western philosophy since the time of the classical Greek philosophers. Form has been taken to be what is self-evident, and certain knowledge must therefore build from direct experiences of form. The primordial relationship between knowledge and being is posed in a passive way in this scene: the self-evidence of form is given through an experience of reception, perception, immediate impression. Thus perception is foregrounded in this scene. Perception is made the principal problem. Husserl developed the concepts of "horizon" and "forestructure" in his analysis of perception. I used these concepts extensively in the phenomenological sketch of action above, but transposed them from the contexts in which Husserl applied them to the context of meaningful action. The significance of the transpositions will become clearer through a consideration of Husserl's own usage of these terms. Perception and Forestructures For Husserl, perceptual form is given only against a set of tacit expectations projected forward in consciousness. We are not totally surprised in the course of ordinary perceptions, for example, because generally forestructures bring the form out for us in some sort of match between object and expectations. When we are surprised, forestructures are quickly rearranged. Thus many commentators on Husserl (e.g., Caputo 1987) emphasize the fact that Husserl did not believe in purely given, purely present objects of perception. What is "given" is always a "given-as," an interpretation. Objects (forms) are only possible within fore- structures that preinterpret them. As Caputo says, this suggests a "hermeneutics of facticity" implicit in Husserl's work (Caputo 1987:57). Husserl, however, wrote as if consciousness had a two-layered structure, such that reflecting backward on, or recollecting, a</page><page sequence="38">Four Scenes 155 perceptual experience could indeed reveal pure forms of presence: The forestructures themselves could be revealed in a direct, uninterrupted way to consciousness. That is to say, though Husserl described perception as a hermeneutics of facticity, he treated the forestructures of the hermeneutic process as if they were directly, noninterpretively revealed to consciousness. It is particularly here that Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and especially Derrida have deconstructed Husserl's theory of perception. As Merleau-Ponty wrote: "I never actually collect together, or call up simultaneously all the primary thoughts which contribute to my perception or to my present conviction" (1962:61). The fore- structures of perceptual experience can be no more revealed to consciousness in an immediate way than any other object of which we are aware. When we examine forestructures phenomen- ologically, some process of objectification occurs and new fore- structures are involved in the objectification: forestructures used to objectify other forestructures. Presence, Pretention, and Retention Derrida's critique of Husserl has become particularly influential during the past two decades. Using his strategy of deconstruction, Derrida reveals that the theory of signs as propounded by Husserl, particularly in his early and middle periods, rests on a theory of perception (inner and outer) that depends on the idea that it is possible to have something immediately present to consciousness. For Husserl, the focal object of perception is already hermeneutically interpreted by forestructures, but the forestructures themselves are supposedly available in immediate presence. The ground for sign usage, according to Husserl, is the nature of perception (in the broadest sense; perception as the experience of any phenomenon). Yet when Husserl's theory of perception is carefully examined we find that this ground for a theory of sign usage itself possesses a sign structure. It is not really a "ground." To put Derrida's argument in a most decontextualized and truncated way, perceptual experience is always inhabited by deferment and absence and never by pure unmediated presence.</page><page sequence="39">156 Essay Three Derrida makes this point in a number of ways, and I will consider only his influential deconstruction of Husserl's theory of internal time consciousness. Husserl argued that objects appear before consciousness in an experience of the "now"; the present. This experience of a "now," he claimed, is characterized by both retention and protention : I am speaking now of the alteration of perspectives. The perspectives of the shape and also of its color are different, but each is in this new way an exhibiting of - of this shape, of this color. Something similar to this can be studied in every modality of the sense-perception (touching, hearing, etc.) of the same thing. In the course of alteration they all play their role as exhibitings, now being interrupted, now beginning again; they offer many types of manifolds of exhibitings, appearances, each of which functions precisely as an exhibiting of In running their course they function in such a way as to form a sometimes discrete synthesis of identification or, better, of unification. This happens not as a blending of externals; rather, as bearers of "sense" in each phase, as meaning something, the perspectives combine in an advancing enrichment of meaning and a continuing development of meaning , such that what no longer appears is still valid as retained [i.e., retention] and such that the prior meaning which anticipates a continuous flow, the expectation of "what is to come," [i.e., protention] is straightway fulfilled and more closely determined. Thus, everything is taken up into the unity of validity or into the one , the thing. (1970:158, italics in original) Merleau-Ponty discusses this issue as follows: The present still holds on to the immediate past without positing it as an object, and since the immediate past similarly holds its immediate predecessor, past time is wholly collected up and grasped in the present. The same is true of the imminent future which will also have its horizon of imminence. But with my immediate past I have also the horizon of futurity which surrounded it, and thus I have my actual present seen as the future of that past. With the imminent future, I have the horizon of past which will surround it, and therefore my actual present as the past of that future. Thus, through the double horizon of retention and protention, my present may cease to be a factual present quickly carried away and abolished by the flow of duration, and become a fixed and identifiable point in objective time. (Merleau-Ponty 1962:69)</page><page sequence="40">Four Scenes 157 There are therefore at least two ways to understand the horizons of retention and protention in the experience of a "now." First, as made clear in the Husserl quotation, the "now" as usually experienced is located within a temporal flow associated with an object of consciousness. Previous phenomena associated with this object, and associated with it as exhibitings "of" this object, are in one sense lost to the past as soon as they arise, but in another sense they are "taken-up" and synthesized with ongoing phenomena, new exhibitings of this object, which is the "index," as Husserl calls it, of the correlation of perspective-specific experiences. In the flow of time about the experience of a durating object, new possible phenomena are protended as well. The Merleau-Ponty quotation provides the other major way to understand retention and protention. To be in a state of perception, to experience a durating object before consciousness, is not only to be aware of an object but to be aware that you are aware of it. And this means that we are aware both of the object and of this object as distinguished from a brief period just gone by that is retained within the single experience of the object "now." I notice a pen on my desk but as I am aware of it I am also aware of a moment just gone by when it (must have) appeared to me. There was a first moment of simple awareness and a second moment of awareness of being-aware-of-the-pen. This reflection occurs every time we think of the now or discuss it. It is an objectification of something prior and the structures of retention and protention enter essentially into this objectification. Retention as Absence and the Sign Structure of Experience Derrida works within the general framework that produced these conclusions to take matters in a very different direction. The "now" experience of this pen does not retain anything, is not the result of any process of "taking up"; it rather symbolizes an absent moment. It "stands for" an experience just gone by in which the pen first appeared to me. It is thus itself like a "sign." What Husserl called "retention" is really absence. What we mean by the "now" is corrupted by the trace of something no longer "now"; something that is not now.</page><page sequence="41">158 Essay Three Husserl thought of signs in terms of the difference between an experience of presence ("real presence," complicated by his interpretive notion of facticity and his two-level theory of consciousness) and the presence of a sign to consciousness that represents (in German, vorstelle ) this originary experience. Objects are revealed to consciousness through such originary experiences, experiences of "real presence," which then can be represented with signs (language, symbols, images). Moreover, at the heart of any stable object of knowledge is the possibility of limitlessly repeating its representation, its sign, with each such repetition standing for the "same" thing - the object. The concept of form, then, is that of a stable thing, available to originary experience taking place in a "now." The "now" is always inhabited by forestructures of retention and protention, and any sign that represents the object could in principle be repeated an infinite number of times, with the stability of the object in the experienced "now" grounding each repetition. The objectivity of form is related to the indefinite number of possible repetitions that could be made of its representations. Each repetition of the sign means the same thing because of this ground: the stability of the object (referent) given immediately through real presence. Derrida indicates the reversal this logic takes when retention is conceived of in terms of absence: With the difference between real presence and presence in representation as Vorstellung, a whole system of differences involved in language is implied in the same deconstruction: the differences between the represented and the representative in general, the signified and signifier, simple presence and its reproduction, presentation as Vor- stellung, re-presentation as Vergegenwartigung, for what is represented in the re-presentation is a presentation ( Präsentation ) as Vorstellung. We thus come - against Husserl's express intention - to make the Vor- stellung itself, and as such, depend on the possibility of re-presentation (Vergegenwartigung). The presence-of-the-present is derived from repeti- tion and not the reverse. While this is against Husserl's express intention, it does take into account what is implied by his description of the movement of temporalization.... (Derrida 1973:52, italics in original). Thus it is repetition that constitutes the present and not the</page><page sequence="42">Four Scenes 159 reverse, given the understanding of retention and protention as genuine absence inhabiting the present. Instead of retention and protention taking their meaning from a form that is always the same, retention and protention force the reconceptualization of form as the product of repetition. Form itself, and not the signs that represent it, is an effect of repetition. Form, which was first conceived within this framework as something fundamentally distinguished from signs, as the prerequisite of signs, now seems to have a sign structure. About retention and protention Derrida writes: One then sees quickly that the presence of the perceived present can appear as such only inasmuch as it is continuously compounded with a nonpresence and nonperception, with primary memory and expectation (retention and protention). These nonperceptions are neither added to, nor do they occasionally accompany, the actually perceived now; they are essentially and indispensably involved in its possibility. Husserl admittedly says that retention is still a perception. But this is the absolutely unique case - Husserl never recognized any other - of a perceiving in which the perceived is not a present but a past existing as a modification of the present. (Derrida 1973:64, italics in original) In this passage Derrida is insisting that Husserl's own insights regarding the horizons of retention and protention in the "now" will undermine Husserl's general view of originary experience and the way in which signs then represent originary experiences.9 He continues: 9 It is interesting that highly objectivistic explorations of the nature of consciousness lead to similar conclusions but fail to apply their conclusions to their own mode of analysis. In Bright Air , Brilliant Fire (1992), Gerald M. Edelman calls upon his several decades of experience as a neuroscientist to develop what is basically an objectivist theory of mind, even though he claims explicitly that his theory is not objectivist. He distinguishes between "primary con- sciousness" - consciousness that is unmediated by structures of time, of anticipation, and of retention - from "higher order consciousness" in which time and self-consciousness play a constitutive role. Once the latter has evolved it is impossible to reach the former, impossible to experience primary consciousness again although its nature is taken up, transformed, and implicitly referenced within higher order consciousness. Thus Edelman uses the term "remembered present" to refer to consciousness through an insight that parallels those of Derrida and the phenomenologists.</page><page sequence="43">160 Essay Three As soon as we admit this continuity of the now and the not-now, perception and nonperception, in the zone of primordiality common to primordial impression and primordial retention, we admit the other into the self-identity of the Augenblick [the blink of an eye, the "now"]; nonpresence and nonevidence are admitted into the blink of the instant. There is a duration to the blink, and it closes the eye. This alterity is in fact the condition for presence, presentation, and thus for Vorstellung [representation] in general; it precedes all the dissociations that could be produced in presence, in Vorstellung. ... Once again, this relation to nonpresence neither befalls, surrounds, nor conceals the presence of the primordial impression; rather it makes possible its ever renewed upsurge and virginity. However, it radically destroys any possibility of a simple self-identity. And this holds in depth for the constituting flux itself. (Derrida 1973:65-6, italics in original) The Trace as a (Non)concept "Presence" is conditioned by repetition, sign-like repetitions, and not the reverse. The reverse case, I remind the reader, was the view that originary experiences of objects in a present "now" are the condition for an indefinite repetition of signs, each of which stands for the "same" object. Derrida reversed the conclusion by arguing that retention and protention refer to actual absence within any "now," altering our idea of an object of experience so that it becomes like a sign, a symbol of what is no longer. Thus, phenomenological efforts to explain form as the result of originary experiences in which a genuine present reveals an object to us without mediation produce a logic that undermines itself. Such originary objects turn out to be "traces" of something already past. Something like "the trace" would have to replace primordial presence as an originary concept. But concepts themselves are framed against this belief in uncorrupted "nows," are themselves a product of the metaphysics of presence. Concepts are constructed against "thingness" which is itself rooted in a scene of primordial presence. Thus Derrida tells us not to substitute "trace" or any of his other core terms ("difference," "arche-writing") for traditional Western concepts that are used to represent a ground for knowledge. In Of Grammatology he writes:</page><page sequence="44">Four Scenes 161 The trace is not only the disappearance of origin - within the discourse that we sustain and according to the path that we follow it means that the origin did not even disappear, that it was never constituted except reciprocally by a nonorigin, the trace, which thus becomes the origin of the origin. From then on, to wrench the concept of the trace from the classical scheme, which would derive it from a presence or from an originary nontrace and which would make of it an empirical mark, one must indeed speak of an originary trace or arche-trace. Yet we know that that concept destroys its name and that, if all begins with the trace, there is above all no originary trace. (Derrida 1974:61) This is to say, minimally, that the essential idea carried by Derrida's use of "trace" erases or cancels out any explication of what it is in words. Closer examination of Husserl's term "retention" gave us the representation of an "actual absence" instead of a past "taken up" within the present. The representa- tion of this actual absence is the trace of what is already gone. But these new concepts, absence and trace, appear only within Husserl's original forestructures and they implode those forestructures as soon as they appear. To assert that there is a trace is finally to proclaim an arche-trace; a concept that erases its name(s). Then What Does It Mean to Feel That One Has Understood Derrida? The notion of an idea whose expression in words must erase itself, of a concept that "destroys its name," dovetails with some of the points made in the previous section on meaningful action phenomenologically considered. I shall try to show this through a list of items: 1) When we feel confident that we "understand" what Derrida is doing with his term "trace," we feel we have mastered a repeatable project. Derrida usually calls this project "deconstruc- tion." But Derrida also tells us that this project will always erase any name given to it. That is to say, our understanding of "trace" symbolizes an implicitly understood project that can be employed to undermine any name given to it as well as employed for other</page><page sequence="45">162 Essay Three purposes. It is rather like the knowledge we have of walking. We feel confident that we can walk - we have walked frequently in the past and we are confident that we can repeat the project of walking indefinitely in the future - but it is futile to try to explain precisely how we do it. We lift one foot, set it down and then lift the other. But how do we lift our feet? Knowing-how cannot always be perfectly translated into symbolic knowledge. Knowing-how is often only demonstrable. The best way to explain walking is to demonstrate walking. Deconstruction is a form of knowing-how. It cannot be perfectly translated into symbolic knowledge. It can only be demonstrated. Moreover it is a special kind of know-how that immediately destroys any sign fashioned to represent it. As soon as we refer to "it" in any way we also indicate our ability to undermine any representation of it, including prelinguistic but conceptual representations. "It" cannot really be "an it." Deconstruction, trace, differance, arche-writing, absence, are all self-destroying concepts we could call "(non)concepts." Since a nonconcept is unavoidably a concept, the immediate self-contradiction is captured with this logism. Derrida often drew lines through words to produce the same effect. The trace is that concept that destroys its name. To understand Derrida is to have certain action impeti on hand. I use the terms "project" and "direction of activity" instead of "impetus" because this understanding is that of a series of activities whose sequential relationships are holistically, implicitly grasped. An understanding of this particular sense of "trace" is a sort of grand impetus. To understand "trace," "arche-writing," "differance" is to have an implicit and holistic understanding of how to write or talk in certain (implicitly understood) contexts toward certain (implicitly understood) ends. It is a matter of being able to act rather than a matter of correctly representing something with theory. 2) Since this is an implicit, holistic understanding, it is not something "present" to us with certainty; it is rather a symbol that points ahead toward activity that would have to be acted out to</page><page sequence="46">Four Scenes 163 increase any certainty associated with it. It is a sort of confidence that we could respond to the formulations of others, or to our own formulations, in a certain (deconstructive) manner without understanding beforehand just precisely how each response would take shape. 3) Although only a few words are used by Derrida to indicate this understanding (trace, differance, arche-writing, deconstruction), these words "stand for" their own inability to stand for the understanding. Similarly, in terms of meaningful action impeti generally, once an impetus has been objectified to the slightest extent, say as an image of barest form, its origin has already vanished. "It" has been occulted by its objectification. By the time we get to a word, from the evolution of an impetus, we have simply built up a series of symbols of symbols. Before the word are preobjective (evolving-objective) marks which have interpret- ed or have taken the impetus in just one of many possible directions. "Understanding" an impetus to act includes the difference between the understanding and the impetus, the latter being an unreachable vanishing point. "Understanding" the term arche-trace, and so forth, is much the same. 4) As stated already, the implicit, holistic understanding is not a form of certain knowledge. It points ahead. It waits to be acted out. Our understanding of "trace," "differance," and so on, is like an anticipation of activity and its consequences. But what it points toward is a vanishing point. Like all impeti to act, "doing" deconstruction does not leave one with a sense of certainty. At best, doing deconstruction or doing the arche-trace gives us a brief period in which an idea has been demonstrated, but all one is left with is the feeling that one could do "it," or something like it, yet again. 5) So the notion of a point ahead, and this point ahead being a vanishing point, is intrinsic to Derrida's idea of the "trace." My phenomenological analysis of meaningful action seems to have stumbled upon insights that parallel those of Derrida, though my</page><page sequence="47">164 Essay Three investigations are far less penetrating and far less subtle than are those of this great thinker. The parallels, however, are important for they offer the possibility of bringing some of the power of Derrida's thought to an area of interest that differs from those he has chosen to explore. Deconstruction has something to offer the phenomenology of meaningful action. 6) To remain with this effort to display parallels between Derrida's deconstruction of "form and the flux" and my own phenomenological sketch of meaningful action, let us ask what the "point behind" might be when the impetus to act is termed "arche-trace." Here the special feature of Derrida's core terms come to light for us. In the case of "trace," "arche-trace," "arche- writing" and so on, the point behind is the same as the point ahead. Derrida has demonstrated the trace through the general project of following any form backward phenomenologically. The "trace" is what we always come to, with any experience of an object, with any impetus to act, when we subject such forms of experience to phenomenological investigation. But Derrida's core terms have the special property of being about (i.e., pointing ahead toward) the very process of acting and representing (pointing back toward). The "trace" is our understanding of a vanishing point behind and a vanishing point ahead unified. One could thus sub- stitute "self-reference" for "trace" in many contexts of discussion, and could throw much light on the difficulties of self-reference in doing so. Juxtaposing the Phenomenology of Action and Its Deconstruction This discussion of scene one, the scene of form and the flux, plays for and against the earlier phenomenological sketch in the following ways. First, it illuminates the strategy used in the phenomenological sketch. This strategy could be called "stretching" the phenomen- ology of action against the limits of scene one as much as possible. Instead of examining objects present to consciousness, I discussed "preobjects"; feeling configurations. These were described,</page><page sequence="48">Four Scenes 165 furthermore, not as objects in immediate relation to consciousness but rather as symbols of symbols. Scene one is thus qualified and stretched by my phenomenological investigation of meaningful acts in important ways. But after the above discussion of form and the flux we can see that the core concepts employed, the primary imagery, are of the scene one variety just the same. Second, Derrida's work alters our mode of awareness of the points made in the phenomenological sketch. These can now be understood as self-referring. When I write about the "symbol of the symbol" and about the "feeling configuration" I am writing about experiences and understandings that include their own deconstruction as written, as acted out. That is, the entire phenomenological sketch of meaningful acts can now be taken as a way to introduce certain iterable but implicit understandings to the reader. The entire sketch could be taken to be something like "indirect teaching" (Kierkegaard 1941) that always runs the risk of becoming reified. It is only a mode of awareness that can save us from the reification and by placing this discussion of scene one next to the phenomenological sketch, an alteration in awareness is sought. Third, the phenomenology of meaningful acts juxtaposed with its deconstruction expand the terms used by Derrida from specialized, third person style terms useful for philosophers and literary critics who must concern themselves with the impulse of great authors and thinkers to totalize knowledge. These terms expand to include a popularized context into which all people enter with every act. Another way to say this is to say that the phenomenology of meaningful action, considered alongside its deconstruction, introduces one to an ontology of social life. This is an ontology of social life that must be implicitly understood. It must be an ontology from which to act rather than an ontology that describes in objective form the fundamental structures of being. Yet another way to say this is to say that these two discussions juxtaposed provide insights into the nature of body feeling and desire that connect these to an ontology of existence. This is an ontology of existence that must be implicitly grasped as</page><page sequence="49">166 Essay Three an iterable understanding. Scene two, in fact, will be an effort to demonstrate this last formulation. Repetition versus Recollection Another angle on this problematic has been developed by John Caputo, who exploits Kierkegaard's contrast between "recol- lection" and "repetition" (Caputo 1987). Caputo demonstrates the way in which the concept of "repetition" first arises in a postmodernist manner with Kierkegaard, who criticized Western modes of knowledge as being efforts to effect a grand recollection of what has already passed. Such efforts lead the philosopher, argued Kierkegaard, to "forget himself [sic]" and attempt to escape existence in an identification with the abstract formulations of his or her philosophy. Choosing to exist, instead of trying to escape existence, requires an acceptance of repetition as opposed to an effort to fix existence objectively in a recollection. In repetition we "act again" in light of our "infinite interest" in existence and the knowledge that we have no formulated grounds for claiming our existence in each act. Each act is an existential risk. Recollection attempts to avoid the risks and the suspicion of a lack of ground that existing necessarily involves. Recollection tries to objectify what cannot be objectified: ongoing, uncertain exist- ence. For phenomenologists, recollection has a primordial and non- reflective form in the structure of retention that accompanies every "now." Husserl believed, as indicated in a quotation from Derrida above, that recollection as retention is a unique form of perception. But Derrida denies this manner of conceiving it: recollection is simply impossible if it is conceived to be a re-presentation or conceived in any way that makes something genuinely past part of a purely given present. Recollections are simply a particular mode of repetition that correspond to a particular cluster of desires and fears. Recollecting is thus partly constructing anew. It is impossible to glance backward in a pure sense; one always moves ahead. We will encounter the distinction between repetition and recollection again in scenes two and three.</page><page sequence="50">Four Scenes 167 ORIGIN ARY SCENE TWO: THE FEELING-BODY The remarks made about proprioceptive configurations in the phenomenological sketch of meaningful action suggest the scene of the feeling-body. Proprioceptive configurations are discovered when one considers the impetus to act as it appears within the awareness of the first person: the actor. However, this scene of the feeling-body could also have been suggested had I spent more time on modes through which one receives impressions of meaning when in the second or third person position. The posture of a body, a gesture, tensed facial muscles all convey meaning. Some ethnographies that make use of the concept of embodied meaning work primarily with this second /third person perspective on the feeling-body.10 However, for our purposes the scene of the feeling-body is best opened as a scene of proprio- ception and therefore as a first person scene. Before proceeding with an extensive investigation of the feeling- body let me note that one could in principle frame one's considerations of it through the problem of perception. Careful investigation of perception reveals its constructed nature: its dependence on repeated mental acts in order to maintain the suggestion of a form present to the senses in time. If I turn my head to gaze at what is to my side I first experience a visual field that is not in focus. I must "look again" to bring focus, which is a mental act. Looking again, however, will not in itself bring out a visual object with duration; it will bring out an impetus to act once more in relation to a foregrounded portion of the visual field. The "object" in this foregrounded position is one portion of a new impetus to act: its "object pole." The impetus to act yet again could be one in which words for the object pole are brought into consciousness, an internalized discursive articulation of what is there. Or it could be a project for moving the eyes about other 10 See Schooling as a Ritual Performance by Peter McLaren (1993), in which body postures are noted as representative of normative "states." That is, patterns of posturing and gesturing are indicative of distinctive, routinely established, normative realms within which particular types of social action are displayed. McLaren has perceptively spotted the holistic, implicit modes of meaning within both static and active positions of the body.</page><page sequence="51">168 Essay Three portions of the visual field, following some of its lines and surfaces in a patterned manner without bringing words to mind. Either way the object has duration in experience only as a portion of a series of action impeti. Instead of bringing out the object as one portion of a related set of action impeti, one could notice that body feelings are associated with the foregrounded portion of the visual field. "Sharp" objects may bring (and do for me) certain sensations to the eye region. Smooth objects may be associated with smooth sensations in the hands, face, or trunk of the body. Any project associated with the object pole, a project of bringing a series of words to mind that describe its features for an imaginary audience or a project of moving one's attention about the visual field, will be associated with alterations in body sensations. Thus, without mental movement there is no form in time, and such movement is associated with body-feelings. Because "mental movement" consists of action impeti and because such impeti occur in holistic figurations felt within the body, one could even explore the idea that perception is "grounded" in body sensations. What is "primordial" in perception is the coordination of activities that differentiate an object pole rather than the object pole itself, and such coordinated projects of activity take holistic forms in body sensation. So movement and feeling seem to go together and both are important for a prolonged perception. Feeling is rooted in the body, always correlated with a localized proprioceptive configura- tion. I could consider the proprioceptive configuration, rather than the image, the central differentiation that brings out the fore- grounded visual object and thus arrive at a scene of the feeling- body instead of the scene of form and flux. Body feeling, rather than form, could be taken as the frame for the meaning problematic as given through prioritizing perception. An approach like this, moreover, could begin with primary texts in phenomenology and expand on certain insights found there. Husserl, in The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology, wrote that all perception of objects correlates to kinesthetic sensations in the "living body" (1970:106-7). One could</page><page sequence="52">Four Scenes 169 exploit his limited focus on kinesthetic, as opposed to pro- prioceptive, body sensation and his limited conception of action as goal-rational action, excluding its normative and dramaturgical forms. From here, the phenomenology of perception could be brought around, in its own terms, toward the feeling-body. However, because of the complex relationship between proprio- ceptions (body feelings) and the I-feeling, I find a second road to scene two more fruitful. This road begins with proprioception itself, rather than perception. Approaching the Body-Feeling from Proprioception We shall need an exercise that works directly with proprio- ception: body awareness. The Exercise Imagine lying on your back in a very relaxed state. You relax out of a mode of conceptual thinking to become aware of your body, how it feels. You notice that certain muscles are rather tight. You have been carrying some tension without fully realizing it. You relax the tense areas, which is rather like ' letting go" of the tension. Visual imagery may accompany this: tightness (pro- prioception) and opacity (visual imagery) together arise as the forms that represent an area of tension. Letting it go is first felt. Then it is represented by a spreading of opacity occurring "on its own," merging with areas nearby so that more and more homogeneity is felt in the body. The image of the abstract "field," "energy field," emerges to represent this: a field with different degrees of opacity that become more even in density and sensation as you relax more and more. The body is a field of sensation that becomes more and more homogeneous as you relax. Now you run your awareness gently from your toes up through your whole body, slowly, until you reach the top of your head, "letting go" every place you discover tension. Then back down. Temptations to think will arise but you must let these go and remember to stay with your body-feeling, over and over again. Moving awareness about the body is the way to stay with it. You</page><page sequence="53">170 Essay Three are approaching homogeneity, a single sensation that encompasses the entire body. This is entirely possible and is experienced by those who practice deep relaxation and /or meditation. A single body sensation. It feels very good. It is a form of pleasure. But the mind has to keep moving to remain with proprioception, rather than wander off with thoughts, and you decide to keep the mental movement with what you represented as "letting go," and "opening." You must let go of pleasure to stay with proprioception. Temptations to think keep arising but you let them go. Temptations to barely note the pleasurable feelings arise and you let them go. They, you understand, would soon lead to thinking. The single sensation seems to be associated with a single process. Actively undifferentiating, letting go, keeps what norm- ally differentiates as "subjectivity" very close to the object: body- feeling. Single Sensation as the "I-Feeling" A new series of tempting thoughts begin to present themselves: thoughts about what is happening. You have the thought, for example, that you are the feeling-body that you have actively undifferentiated. This thought arises because there does seem to be an I-feeling that fuses with the body feeling when you are letting go instead of thinking. Your thought, actually, is that you could be the single homogeneous body sensation if only you could "get there"; if you could only remain undifferentiated as a subjectivity, a totally implicit "I," a single sensation of I-ness and body together. But this thought is based on a differentiation. Even when you are able to "let go" of such temptations before they delineate into actual thought, your awareness of this possibility, that you are the feeling-body and would know it if only you could "get there," let go "enough," is always ahead of itself. It is based on a distinction between experience and awareness of experience that is your movement in time or that perhaps makes time. You continue this movement for a while: a single sensation that feels good and feels as if it is "you"; awareness that that is what just was, that you were in that state but could only have some</page><page sequence="54">Four Scenes 171 cognizance of it through difference, through being aware of it as object, and then returning to single sensation by letting go. The primordial rhythm, the primordial repetition, is suggested as: sensation inclusive of "I-feeling," awareness of this, letting go, repeated awareness of sensation as inclusive of "I-feeling," and so on. The rhythm has three primordial moments. Representation as Desire Now another very tempting thought arises. You are not the single sensation of body awareness from which you seem to come and toward which you seem to go, but you are a single process of letting go. Or you are both, or are the play between the two. You are aware of yourself as a single sensation without differentiation, except that there is always the differentiation of awareness from sensation. Yet this differentiation of awareness from sensation is always responded to by a "letting go" that is like "opening." Over and over. It occurs to you that part of the process is learning to respond in one way, in the same way, to your own representation of it, again and again. The process is a single thing, like a single way of responding to "your self." But you have to remember this one response, and yet you cannot hold on to the memory of it because you cannot maintain the differentiation required to retain a memory. You cannot formulate it, or otherwise represent it, without breaking out of the rhythm. So it is not exactly you who always responds in the same way, it is rather a way of being open to having something given to you over and over again. And it is like "finding yourself," more than constructing yourself or being yourself, over and over again. Several things stand out that may be formulated as a list: 1) It makes sense to think of "responding to your self," or responding to the representation of yourself, as an "I-feeling" that arises. (This insight will occur again against a new scene, scene three, and have expanded significance there.) 2) "Remembering" is important. The response to the repres- entation "single embodied sensation" must be "the same" each</page><page sequence="55">172 Essay Three time and it must be a "letting go" or "opening." Because you cannot hold on to a formulation of this same way of responding to yourself, "remembering" simply must occur over and over again. It must come to be part of the awareness-of that comes and goes. 3) "Finding," "being given," "letting happen" all also make sense. The experience is given, not willed or constructed, when you remember to be open, or to let go. It makes sense to describe part of it as having its own agency, which you simply allow to take place. 4) Your experience of thinking as temptation takes on added significance. The representation "single sensation" is tempting because it is not a neutral representation of something conceived to be an object, but is a desire, and a forestructure. The single sensation is the representation and a feeling at the same time. In particular, it feels good, it is a pleasure. But in addition, this pleasure points beyond itself: on the one hand toward greater pleasure, toward its indefinite intensification, an intensification of the sensation via letting go again;11 on the other hand toward a lot of exciting thoughts, if you do not let go but rather try to draw some conclusions from your experience. To yield to either desire is to forget to let go. Thinking is indeed a temptation for it leads away from the experience and from the goal toward which the experience points. It is a way of acting from a forestructure. Becoming excited about more intense pleasure turns into a lack of genuine "letting go," for it amounts to an effort at retaining pleasure or at retaining a conception (forestructure) of what is ahead; both of which must go. 5) So desire appears here in a primordial, undifferentiated form as representation. Representation is an impetus to act; here to "act in thought." As soon as you have a representation of the sensation you have an impetus to hold on to pleasure, or to think about the 11 This experience of pleasure and the promise of an indefinite extension of pleasure is well known to yogis and meditators. It is described in Ajaya 1978.</page><page sequence="56">Four Scenes 173 experience which offers its own pleasures. The representation is totally prefocal; it is structured by a bare differentiation between passive sensation and responding impetus. 6) Desire seems to give birth to time. It differentiates from what just was and it points toward what could be. But desire seems to simply come; it is not willed or chosen. You learned how to stay open and not act, and this led to a rhythm: sensation, desire, sensation; which is also, sensation, representation of sensation, sensation; which is also sensation, awareness of sensation, sensation. 7) Desire is contradictory. The rhythm "sensation, desire, sensation" always seems to result in an intensification of "sensation" in its third phase. And this points toward a grand experience of pleasure: of total sensation, or total merger in sensation to come. It is as if the forestructures of desire are accumulating each time you let one go. If you can just stay with it all and keep letting go,12 the grand experience may come. But desire appears as the second phase. A sort of choice is there: one can either let go or surrender to an action impetus (a thought). When one is cognizant of the teleology of the experience - the pointing toward a grand experience just ahead - one wishes to act for this. But one must remember not to act toward this telos if one is to move closer to it. The desire for the end point must be totally given up every time it arises as a second moment in the rhythm, if one is to make any progress toward what the desire promises. And giving up is what makes the third moment a more intense sensation of pleasure, pointing ever more clearly toward a consummate pleasure. Letting go is what allows the forestructures to accumulate; the implicit portions of each anticipation seem to contain more and more possibilities. Thus the situation is 12 Various meditation techniques exist to help the meditator "let go." Mantras are a common technique to this end. Repetition of a mantra requires letting go of desires: letting go of the desire to hold on to a pleasurable feeling as well as letting go of the desire to begin thinking about the experiences one is having.</page><page sequence="57">174 Essay Three contradictory. To have what is desired and anticipated one must let go of desire. 8) Letting go results in a repetition. It results in the repetition of (i) sensation, (ii) awareness-of-sensation, (iii) letting-go, (iv) intensified-sensation. It is not a repeated "act" because the only agency involved is the choice not to act, "letting go." This allows an anonymous repetition to act of itself; a sort of vibration that throws one out in the second phase ("awareness of") but waits for one to fall back in. Intensification of Desire The single sensation intensifies and it gets harder to keep from thinking, to keep letting go, to keep opening, because the potential thoughts seem increasingly important, increasingly tempting. The pleasure is related to the I-feeling. The I-feeling appears in pleasurable modes of desire, as foreunderstandings of how the I- feeling could be fixed and enhanced by the articulation of its nature. The temptation to think increasingly becomes a tempta- tion to think about the process that is occurring, a promise that doing so would reveal the secret of the "I," that would affirm the self in an infinite and incontestable way. Yet this exercise has taught you that an even greater promise of articulating the "I" will occur, in a pleasurable and intensified way, if you let go rather than articulate the tempting forestructures. The exercise is increasingly becoming something that fundamentally concerns you and your most exciting, promising, existentially basic desires. You notice that each new temptation, each new impetus to represent and claim the "I" in an articulation, is a recollection of what has just occurred. You think that you are the process of letting go from recollection of the process. Your identity rests between this split between sensation and awareness of sensation that repeats. You have represented this as "process," as "letting go again and again and again," as a rhythm or vibration. As a process it is caught in time but you think that the secret of time is getting close to your understanding. It is a repetition that you must allow to exist. Your only "act" is to relax away from all temptations to</page><page sequence="58">Four Scenes 175 act. The movement simply is. Time is close to collapsing because there is just one thing, a process, which, however, keeps making two things and from these two, many possible things. It is an eternal now, just one thing, but it eludes you. By opening, letting go, over and over you feel you are moving toward the total now, the eternal now, the consummation of a primordial desire. Accumulative Incorporation of Forestructures and Self-Reference So the intensification of desire is also an intensification of sensation, of pleasure. And this is because desire is a mode of I- feeling, a state that in this case is at once pleasurable and yet a pointing forward toward more. As a state of pointing forward, the I-feeling mode is fused with a forestructure to recollect what just was. But you have learned to let go of recollecting in order to allow the repetition to repeat itself. When it repeats you have an intensified sensation and a new desire to recollect. The new forestructures incorporate older forestructures; assimilate the newly given sensation of I-ness as the result of a letting go of a prior forestructure to recollect. Forestructures seem to accumulate, potentialities seem to assimilate previous potentialities. The intensification of desire and pleasure, you realize in another indulgent thought, involves the concept of the "limit": the idea of capturing an infinite process in a singular representation that is also the end or goal of the infinite process. The process is infinite. It is an infinite letting go of temptations to think that have increasingly become temptations to think about or recollect the process itself. The goal of the process is felt as a desire; a feeling of pleasure that promises more. The goal is thus not known, the desire not fulfilled, when one is within the state of desire. The goal is yet to come and is felt this way. But since the secret of the experience lies in repetition, would not formulating the rule of the repetition give us the goal in conceptual form? For example, we might say that what is occurring is something like a mathematical series that goes on forever by repeating the same rule. But by not articulating this foreunderstanding we are applying this very same "rule" (letting go) to itself, to a fore- conception of itself, an implicit representation of itself. And this</page><page sequence="59">176 Essay Three suggests an infinite series of letting go of the concept of an infinite series. Not an infinite process of letting go of the same fore- understanding of an infinite series, but a process in which one locates an I-feeling mode within an infinite series of repeated openings ("letting goes"), and then lets go of this articulation to include the prior location of self within an infinite series that is within yet another infinite series of letting go that is orthogonal to the first. This in turn is let go of to result in yet another series inclusive of all prior series and orthogonal to them. I realize that my spatial imagery might be confusing; the imagery of series along axes orthogonal to each other. Another way to represent this is to think of it as a series of reflections that continuously objectify what was taken for granted and unnoticed in the previous moment. The image of the rhythm is an objectification of what has been happening in time; an objectifi- cation suggestive of a linear movement with "letting go" a crucial process for moving from one phase of the linear rhythm to the next. Once conceptualized as a rhythm, a temporal process is encapsulated in one image. The objectification was a recollection that gave an image to represent what had been taking place before. It was an act of recollection, involving forestructures to bring out the form "rhythmic linear process." But then this conceptualization, "the rhythm," may also be "let go." This is the shift from one axis to another that is orthogonal to the first. It is a letting go of the whole process or rhythm. Yet this too can be objectified, or recollected and then let go to produce a new series. The image of the rhythm represents a process that can be applied to itself, much in the way that the movement from point to point along a line can be applied to the line itself, generating movement along a plane. Through this you (we) keep finding hints of something "that is the same." What is it? It could be the process of letting go, so that we are letting go of letting go of letting go. ... Or it could be the rhythm produced by this letting go, and that includes the moment of letting go within its moments. Then this rhythm begins to be a rhythm of rhythms.</page><page sequence="60">Four Scenes 177 Perhaps what is the same is neither the letting go nor the resulting rhythm but the movement from one dropped fore- structure to the next. This movement is understood to be infinite, in that it repeats over and over again, representing itself in forestructures of articulation that each time include prior forestructures. Oh, but how to really grasp that eternal movement? How to really represent it? It is not the I-feeling mode, for that only appears when one has moved away from an impetus to articulate it as incorporated. It is not the "letting go," for that also depends upon the impetus to recollect, which must be dropped. Each infinite series amounts to the projecting behind of the impetus to represent, and the projecting ahead of this same impetus, which is more and more like a project from which many impeti would differentiate were one to indulge in thinking. Each infinite series points behind toward a vanishing point and ahead toward a vanishing point. What remains the same is given over and over again outside of any representation, any feeling- configuration, any impetus. It was always "just there" and "just there again." But it cannot be pinned down. It is the movement implicated by the continuous rise of new modes of desire that we understand to be the goal of the movement itself but that seem to never actually "appear" before us, even though the forestructures promise ever more convincingly to possess a grasp of it all. It cannot appear before us and we even understand this, experience forestructures that try to pin it down by promising to explicate (pin down) the impossibility of pinning it down. At any rate, successful series of letting go do not result in indulgent thoughts like those just articulated above. But they do result in a building of body sensations, a building of the energies in your feeling-body, to an intolerable potential. At some point you have to act, you cannot let go any longer, and you realize that you already are acting by thinking about this experience: recollecting it and representing it and making conclusions from it. In doing so, you have lost it.</page><page sequence="61">178 Essay Three Representation as "Flattening" Your last tempting thought was that you are the single process- of-body-feeling-and-letting-that-go-moving-toward-an-ending- state-which-is-an-understanding-of-the-process-itself. You are the movement that never takes a form. Yet this movement is also given to you just as much as it is you. It is infinitely you, infinitely other than you. Long ago in the period of this exercise, your representations of singularity hovered about "single embodied sensation." Now this has become "single process-of-body-feeling-and-letting-that-go." This representation, it occurs to you, is sort of like "flattening" process into form. That is, it is a grand recollection, a single idea that seems to fully capture a primordial temporal process plus all forms that implicate it, and thus it is a grand recollection that almost escapes temporal process by grasping it as a singularity. There is just "one thing," and it is eternal, and it is you, and it is all else as well. All possibilities are contained in it but you have recognized all possibilities as temptations or desires, and have returned them to the "one" by letting go over and over again. Because you could "think," "represent," the infinite over-and-over you have finally "grasped it," that is, grasped "It," that is, "made it like a thing." You have flattened an infinite process differentiated through an infinite number of self-reflective moves, each one of which incorporated those previous to it into a single idea. "Wow!" you think, "I could construct a whole philosophy from this! I could apply the metaphors of (a) always being beyond myself, (b) embodied meaning which always moves outside its embodiment, (c) truth as a single thing that implicitly holds everything within it, (d) meaning as desire, (e) the teleology of meaning-as-desire - its pointing toward a single thing or experience, (f) this single experience ahead being its own movement toward itself! I could apply these metaphors to all sorts of things! Isn't such a flattening, the representation of a process as a single thing that in turn is this very process, rather like what Hegel was doing with Geist ?" Geist is the product of an effort to flatten process into thing. Geist is supposed to be the primordial</page><page sequence="62">Four Scenes 179 "thing" outside of time that unfolds to create time only so that it might then come back to itself. Geist is inclusive of the understanding that formulations like "Geist" are not what it is. Geist is not really a "thing." Hegel must have understood this. On the other hand, in trying to write it down he perhaps betrayed a merely partial under- standing of it, or perhaps an indulgence. Was not his philosophy just a grandiose identity claim, as Kierkegaard suspected? But then Kierkegaard wrote lots of books too! One can in fact never know whether another has grasped this insight or not, nor to what extent. As Gayatri Spivak writes in her introduction to Derrida's Of Grammatology ; "Perhaps this entire argument hangs on who knew how much of what he was doing. The will to knowledge is not easy to discard" (1974:xxxviii, italics in original). The will to knowledge is a form of the will to exist; it is a primordial structure of motivation constituting all identity claims. The temptation to stop letting go and start thinking is a version of the "will to knowledge." It is the desire to assert one's self into a world of many not-selves. If we (I and you) could only write all this down, and of course write it down so thoroughly as to ensure that all our readers will understand us, what a grand thing that would be! How immensely valuable and important our work would be! Yet, because of the impossibility of pure presence, because of the "pre- understanding of subjectivity," because of the sign structure of experience, we never could write it down in such a seamless manner, we never could feel certain that we would be understood by others, and thus, we could never be ourselves certain of these formulations. The will to knowledge is fundamentally futile because it is fundamentally in contradiction with itself. And, correlatively, by now I (you) have left our single body- feeling far behind by differentiating so much! We have indulged. And we never reached the promised goal intrinsic to the single process and the single sensation. Shucks! We have only indulged in partial forestructures and petty identity claims and the full sense of it all still eludes.</page><page sequence="63">180 Essay Three Is This a Legitimate Scene? Should We Take It Seriously? If the above fantasy seems mystical and improbable it may be only because this fantasy is not the sort of scene that has informed Western academic discourse. The themes raised by this scene are no doubt consistent with the writings of various Western mystics. But mystics are generally discredited by academia in the West. Certainly, the themes raised by this scene do have parallels in the work of Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre, Derrida and other Western thinkers, but generally as they are developed against the scene of form and the flux. The scene of the feeling- body has not yet been thoroughly probed in the way that the scene of visual perception has in the West. But this "fantasy" is no more fantastic than is the scene of flux and form. Actually, for me it is much less fantastic and requires less artificiality than considerations of object perception do. One can have an experience like the one described above by practicing meditation and relaxation techniques. Moreover, scene two is quite commonly implied in Eastern discourses on knowledge and truth. Yogic meditation is nothing but a way to induce a state similar to that described above. It is a "willed" repetition, usually of a sound (a mantra) that is done in order to achieve the experience of repeated opening - "letting go." Sometimes it is attention to the breath, rather than a mantra, that is used. And Eastern philosophy is absolutely insistent that the vanishing point of the feeling-body is the merging of awareness into a single sensation that implicitly "contains" everything. It is a vanishing point because once entered there is nothing to be said. There is no person who is experiencing, there is no object being experienced, there is no time, there is nothirtg to represent. It is somehow both the singular Idea {Geist) and a primordial void. This is because there is no differentiation within this state. In the East the vanishing point is ahead of experience. It is what "just was," true, but more importantly it is what one is moving toward. And it is completely possible to experience with much effort: effort to learn effortlessness, as the yogis would say. Effort as well to increase one's stamina for containing high levels of "energy." When one has this experience one's personal identity is destroyed;</page><page sequence="64">Four Scenes 181 no memory of the experience can be retained, no words can represent it. One remembers going into it and falling back out, nothing else. It is called samadhi in yogic philosophy, nirvana in Buddhist philosophy. It is said to be an ecstatic and self- transforming state, so that one is altered when one comes back from it (Anandamurti 1968, 1978; Vahiduddin 1974). This scene has been ignored in mainstream Western discourses but it now seems more legitimate, more credible to Western minds, with the popularity of postmodern thought and its own versions of the concept of "repetition" and "embodied mean- ing."13 Kierkegaard's "third stage" of repetition, the stage beyond his esthetic and ethical stages, is really a "waiting for" or "allowing," a repetition that repeats itself (Kierkegaard 1983). It is "letting go," is spiritual surrender. It is related to the concept of "grace" in many religions. Feeling-Body as Flux I deliberately used the term "vanishing point" in the section above to display some congruence between scene two and scene one. The problem of "representation" was already made explicit in my discussion of both scenes. Other core terms come up in both scenes as well. The "flux," for example, can be reconceptualized against the scene of the feeling-body. Here, however, it is tied much more closely to what some Eastern writers call the "I-feeling" or the mahatatva (Anandamurti 1968). You are the flux, are the ground, but "you" are more than what you usually think you are in that you are not an entity, not a form, and thus nothing that could be recollected. In the West, conceptual approaches usually work toward the flux by prioritizing the "object," or form, in experience and then working on the presuppositions and the phenomenological features of object perception. This is done by distilling our recollection of perceptual experience, our representations of it, 13 The body is often described as a layer of mind in yogic philosophy.</page><page sequence="65">182 Essay Three away from feelings in the body. Visual perception dominates Western notions of form. For our purposes, several differences between certain Eastern and many Western writings related to the flux, to the point ahead and the point behind, are worth listing. 1) In the twentieth century, the works of authors like Heidegger and Derrida have come close in the West to convergence with Eastern ideas. But most readings of the work of these authors emphasize the groundlessness of the flux, the erosion of all claims to a certain origin of knowledge and meaning. In much of Eastern thought there is indeed the claim that a "ground" of sorts exists; but it is not a conceptual ground, it is rather an cxpcrionco (to use Derrida's strategy of sous rature; crossing out a name to indicate a self-destroying concept) of what is both prior to and ahead of existence. 2) In the West, scene number one is most often at the root of those theories of meaning that take experience seriously. Scene number one emphasizes the object pole of perception and from there introduces considerations of the subject pole. In the post- structuralist literature, this scene deconstructs. In the East, scene number two is often at the root of theories of meaning. Scene number two is concerned with proprioception rather than with perception: states of awareness in which the "object pole" is not quite yet objective, for it consists of feeling states, I-feeling modes, configurations of desire. This does not exactly lead to a deconstruction, because a ground is suggested for existence even while Eastern philosophers also claim the impossibility of a ground for conceptual certainty. 3) Philosophy in the West has often been a massive effort to recollect and fix truth conceptually in a form objective to consciousness. Recent postmodern "philosophy" takes its sense from the previous centuries of Western philosophy when this project of fixing all truth conceptually was taken seriously. The point of much postmodern work is the deconstruction of the</page><page sequence="66">Four Scenes 183 scenes upon which this effort of grand recollection had been erected. "Philosophy" in the East, or at least much of it, has not tried to recollect and objectively state what is the case, but has rather viewed systematic modes of thought to be nothing more than guides for living, some of which will work better than others, for some groups of people. Philosophy has been viewed as ideology in the East, at times helpful for guiding spiritual practice but always a distortion, always an imperfect map of the structures of existence, and always ultimately discardable. Recollection in Scene Two A final contrast between these particular strands of thought in much Eastern philosophy and the logocentric tradition of the West, one important for our discussion of meaning, can be made by looking again at the concept of recollection. For many Eastern philosophers, as for Kierkegaard in the West, recollection, representation of what just was as something that is, amounts to: a) a condition of existence, though one can choose not to invest oneself in it, can choose to let its temptations go b) a process always motivated, the product of some form of desire and /or fear c) a process resulting in frustration because once a state of gratification is reached one becomes aware of it and is thereby beyond it These aspects of recollection apply whether it is conceived against scene one or scene two. Scene two does not give us a conceptual "ground" for meaning. In fact, the way I have treated scene two works against the notion of "ground." My treatment supports the idea that it is not helpful to think in terms of grounds aside from a state such as that of samadhi - a state that cannot be known unless it is experienced, and once experienced cannot be represented or even remembered in explicit form. The aporias</page><page sequence="67">184 Essay Three (conceptual cul de sacs) that theories of representation encounter make states like samadhi and nirvana seem all the more plausible. Scene two does suggest that desire is essential to meaning and knowing. And it suggests that desire appears in the body, as a feeling. Desire is by its nature teleological: an impetus to act for a gratification. So we do not have literally a "ground" with the feeling-body but we do, perhaps, have a direction. Scene two does not necessarily result in an existential aporia while it clarifies conceptual aporias. Our analysis of the question of meaning against scene two resulted in the possibility of reconceptualizing what I have called the "vanishing point" as a "limit point" toward which desire aims. I am only indicating that this is possible here, but the fact that it is possible is important. By sinking back into the feeling-body, desire arises in holistic and implicit forms that would take more shape if acted upon. But letting go of all such desire, not repressing but letting go, builds and intensifies body feeling and results in an anticipation of a single consummate experience. At the same time this single experience would be an experience of unmediated presence; at the same time this single experience would have no differentiation, not even that between subject and object; at the same time it would be the flux; at the same time it would be genuine certainty; at the same time it would be destruction; at the same time it would be the self- affirmation one always seeks. For social researchers the significance of scene two does not immediately reside in the sort of totalizing considerations made above. It resides in secondary structures that may be derived from what has been said above. In particular, the existence of what I have called the "identity claim" in all acts of meaning takes much of its sense against the findings made from this discussion of scene two. But that point will be more clear after a discussion of scene three. Additionally, we have yet to understand what "recollection" consists of. Futile or not, it seems that recollection is a structure of existence central to the question of meaning. Scene three will further illuminate the nature of recollection.</page><page sequence="68">Four Scenes 185 ORIGIN ARY SCENE THREE: THE ORIGIN OF INTERSUBJECTIVITY Scene three is a fantasy that begins back in time and then moves suggestively toward us. It is a scene that is traditionally developed outside of twentieth-century style phenomenological investiga- tions, and thus is a scene that begins with more unexamined presuppositions than do scenes one and two. This is both its charm and its weakness. By avoiding the sort of beginnings we made in scenes one and two, which foreground the first person perspective, scene three has given hope to some contemporary thinkers who wish to evade the difficulties involved when one consciousness attempts to know itself through reflection. Scene three, however, is dependent on all the substantial presup- positions of science, those presuppositions that phenomenology specifically problematizes. All originary scenes have presup- positions, just different types, and something like scene three is necessary in efforts to give explanations of various phenomena that can be revealed only through phenomenological analysis. I will discuss scene three first as it appears in the work of George Herbert Mead and then as it appears in the writings of Georg Hegel. I produce a substantial reinterpretation of George Herbert Mead's theory in what follows, devoting the bulk of my discussion in this section to him. I discuss portions of Hegel's philosophy afterwards, primarily for the sake of insights that are absent in Mead's work. Scene Three in the Legacy of George Herbert Mead Scene three is perhaps most persuasively formulated in modern discourses in the work of George Herbert Mead (1967) and those contemporary authors like Jürgen Habermas (1987b, ch. v) and Ernst Tugendhat (1986) who have tightened and improved upon Mead's original insights. The main idea in this work is to begin by accepting the existence of a physical world that exhibits the basic laws and processes we find in nature, including species evolution. Then the way in which consciousness and language might have evolved within a species that lives in groups is considered.</page><page sequence="69">186 Essay Three Mead and Hegel approached this problem, which is the phylogenesis of consciousness for Mead and the history of consciousness for Hegel, dialogically. Self-consciousness originated in interactions and its basic structures evolved from the basic structures of a dialogue. That is the specific feature that distinguishes this scene from other possible "scientific" sorts of scenes one could imagine (such as those employed by evolutionary biologists, cognitive scientists, and neuroscientists). Something like a scene three mode of investigation does arise in the work of currently popular "consciousness theorists" who, like Mead, find the idea of an organism that learns to stimulate itself through various modes of "talking to itself" unavoidable in efforts to explain thought, the conscious monitoring of action, and the existence (actual or virtual) of selves (e.g., see Dennett 1991: ch. 7). Dialogical theories of thought and consciousness can also be framed as ontogenetic problems and studied through develop- mental psychology or psychoanalytic theory. However, I will only discuss the phylogenesis of the dialogical mind in this essay and I will only work with Mead's initiating version of it. In this phylogenetic scene, early forms of interaction, characterized by something like stimulus-response patterns between group members, develop toward symbolic interactions through learning processes. At some stage in this evolutionary process, group members begin to internalize the standard first and second person positions associated with routine interactions. Meaning could not exist as such, according to this view, until an entire species developed learned interactive routines which then become progressively internalized. Imagine an early human or prehuman species living in groups. Members of a group share a repertoire of routine acts and routine responses to acts emitted by fellow members. This shared repertoire of interactive patterns forms the basis for the emergence of early symbols such that the beginning portion of a shared stimulating action comes to implicitly symbolize the full act and its consequences to organisms in the responding position. Through these early implicit symbols - the beginning portions of routine acts - organisms eventually learn to internalize the</page><page sequence="70">Four Scenes 18 7 associated first and second person positions. That is, they learn to conjoin (or otherwise transpose) their experience of emitting the stimulating act with their experience of responding to this same act when another member exhibits it toward them. The crucial moment is thought to occur when the act in question means the same thing to both actor and addressee. The identical meaning is constituted by the position taking of each organism; both actor and addressee can take the position of each other through the symbolic act. In this way intersubjectivity is born. The transposition of first and second person positions through symbolic action simul- taneously establishes the preconditions for developing the capacity for multiple perspective taking and for developing a sense of self or self-consciousness. So, what begins as patterns of shared routine actions and shared routine responses becomes, through several intermediate stages of symbol-dependent internalization, an early form of intersubjectivity. Internalization, Expectation, and Responding to One's Own Act The concept of "internalization" is treated by Mead through two crucial terms: "expectation" and "responding to one's own act." Let's pull up a fantasy consistent with this scene to understand these two important terms. Consider one routine action shared by organisms living in a group, that is made by a member toward another member with routinely experienced consequences. Mead liked to use dog behavior to exemplify many of his points, so let's follow him here and take his example of routine canine attacking behavior: one dog attacking another with biting. All dogs in the group exhibit the attacking behavior at times, and all dogs in the group are at times attacked by other dogs. Now, why should we use dog behavior to illustrate the basic principles of this theory, which after all is meant to apply to prehuman groups or even early human groups? Mead chose the example of dog behavior no doubt because it is convenient. Most of us are familiar with dogs and even interact with dogs routinely. For the sake of armchair speculations, dogs are an advantageous choice. But we must not take "dog" literally. I will continue to</page><page sequence="71">188 Essay Three write of mythical "dogs" in much of what follows, but the idea is to think of a rather advanced mammal and use your familiarity with real dogs as a way to fill in details so that a theory sketch may develop (Dennett 1991:41). A theory sketch is meant to be suggestive in terms of principles and is willing to make errors on the level of details. For dogs to be useful in building a theory sketch, the limitations of this choice should always be kept in mind. There are several limitations; the fact that dogs are not even in the primate group is only one of them. In addition, Mead's preoccupation with attacking behavior and, by implication, with actions leading toward relationships of dominance and submission that are so prominent among dogs, must be noted as a bias. Hegel displays a similar bias toward competition and domination in his discussion of the origins of intersubjectivity. The evolution of gestures and symbols in groups of mammals could well have originated in two other modes of interaction: mother-infant relations motivated by care, and noncompetitive interactions between adults motivated by the need for help. Very possibly, symbol evolution developed from all three modes of interaction: those motivated by competition, those motivated by care, and those motivated by the need for assistance. On the other hand, the emphasis on attacking behavior in dogs is certainly suggestive and serves heuristic purposes specifically for speculations about the roles played by act truncation, anticipation, gesture evolution, and symbol formation. In Hegel's case, the emphasis on a competition for dominance also produces insights into the connections between meaningful action and power: the internal role that a will to power (ultimately a will to knowledge) plays in meaning. Thus I will not apologize too much for following Mead and speculating about competitive interactions as illustrated by dogs. Speculations similar to those that follow ought to be developed as well about these same factors (act truncation, anticipation, and power) as they appear in mother-infant interactions and cooperative behaviors between adult organisms.</page><page sequence="72">Four Scenes 189 Returning now to Mead's theory and his use of dog behavior to develop it, expectations enter the plot of this specific story initially from the second person position: the position in which one is attacked. Through learning processes, dogs begin to expect that they will soon be bitten when they perceive the beginning of the attacking action exhibited toward them. Thus, they begin to dodge or retreat when they perceive the bared teeth and hear the snarl- like sounds of an attack behavior emitted in their direction. No doubt smells associated with the beginning of an attack are also important. Once the attack behavior begins, with its sights, sounds, and smells, the animal in second person position gets out of the way - retreats. This is a form of second person expectation that constitutes a new form of action: dodging or retreating before actually being bitten because of an expectation. Of course animals in the second person position could also learn to quickly counterattack before receiving bites, and this would also involve a form of second person expectation. But I will limit the discussion to the consideration of retreating behaviors so that the main ideas about act truncation, expectation, and early symbol formation may be developed. Retreating behavior has the conceptual advantage of evolving into a consequence desired by the first person, as we will soon see. Counterattacking lacks this advantage for our conceptual inquiries. Second person expectation constitutes a new act. The actual behavior of retreating upon sensing the beginning of an attack could well be identical to a primary act of retreat that was previously committed only when actually coming under attack and receiving bites. When this older act is committed due to an expectation it becomes newly constituted. It is an old act committed under new circumstances. Implicitly, second person expectation also constitutes the beginning portion of the first person attack behavior as a sort of presymbol. This is the case if we stick to Mead's arguments. The beginning of the attack now implicitly stands for, or represents, the full act of attack and its consequences as it is experienced from the second person position. The symbolic value of the beginning of</page><page sequence="73">190 Essay Three an attack is not experienced as such by the retreating dog. Its status as a symbol is only implicit at this point and is also limited to the perspective of the second person. More developmental steps will have to be completed before symbols become explicit portions of experience. Second person expectation generates new actions that become shared and thus become part of the group's action repertoire. All dogs, in time, begin to dodge or retreat when they perceive the beginning of an attack addressed toward them. All dogs continue, of course, to attack other dogs at times too. Now conditions are set for forms of first person expectation to be learned in the group.14 When beginning an attack, dogs frequently find that their object (the dog they wish to bite) dodges or retreats. They learn to expect dodging and retreating behavior when beginning an attack. At a certain point in time, these dogs will come to desire to produce a response of dodging or retreating in other dogs and will truncate their attacking action to its beginning portions only. The learned expectation, that the other dog will retreat, makes it possible for a new desire to emerge: that of causing another dog to retreat. The snarl is born in this way, constituted by the expectation that other dogs will retreat when the start of an attack is exhibited. Mead calls truncated actions like these, constituted by first person expectations and the new desires they make possible "gestures." The snarl is a "gesture." Its constituting first person expectation is that the one snarled at will back off. Its constituting desire is also that the one snarled toward will back off. Implicitly, our presymbol has evolved to a new level. The beginning of an attacking behavior comes to represent, for the dog 14 Although the development of a snarl from original attacking behaviors in dogs could have begun from second person expectations, there is no reason to assume that all gestures and, eventually, symbolic acts themselves, originated with second person expectation in the antecedent position. First person expectations could have been antecedent in the case of any gesture we choose for speculative purposes. Either way, both first and second person expectations would have to be brought into the picture and the question of which might have been antecedent is not relevant to the insights sought after. This fantasy assumes an antecedent status for second person expectations, but an equally illuminating fantasy could be invented that begins with first person expectations.</page><page sequence="74">Four Scenes 191 in first person position, the movement of a dog in second person position "out of the way." The snarl stands for the response of the dog in second person position as this response is experienced by the dog in first person position. All the sensory experiences aroused when another dog retreats from one's truncated attack, plus the experiential components of an ending state (the state experienced when the other dog is driven off) are implicitly represented by the way a snarl feels to the dog in first person position. The snarl implicitly symbolizes the retreat of the other dog for the dog who snarls. It could only do this, of course, if it also implicitly represented the full act of attack and its consequences to the dog in second person position. The snarl, at this stage of development, has implicit symbolic value for both the first person and the second person: but no organism yet experiences both "meanings" of the snarl simultaneously. Rather, organisms either experience the snarl as first persons to implicitly mean that the one addressed will back off; or as second persons to implicitly mean that the one snarling is about to attack and bite. The gesture "snarl" is an implicit symbol that roughly means, "Move or be bitten!" to both the dog in first person position and the dog in second person position, but from different and nonexperientially integrated perspectives. The identity of this symbol for both dogs is not yet within the experience of either one. The dog in first person position simply desires the other dog to move while the dog in second person position simply desires to move so as not to be attacked. Neither dog has a grasp of the situation from the other's perspective. The dog in second person position does not read any symbolic intentions into the act of the dog in first person position. The dog in first person position does not act in order to communicate an intention to the dog in second person position. For both, learning is occurring only with respect to what objective events may be expected in certain situations. When gestures like the snarl become distributed throughout the group and routine interaction patterns develop based on them, a sort of culture of gesture-mediated interaction exists. Gesture- mediated interaction depends on an objective association between learned second person expectations and learned first person</page><page sequence="75">192 Essay Three expectations. This association is objective, at this point, in the sense that it exists outside the experience of the organisms themselves but is clearly visible to outside, sophisticated observers such as ourselves. "Move or be bitten" is, in the jargon of ethologists, the objective meaning of the symbol "snarl." More developmental steps must be completed to internalize objective meaning so that it becomes actual meaning - intersubjectively constituted meaning in the experience of all organisms involved. The third main stage in Mead's theory of the evolution of symbols depends upon established routines of gesture-mediated interaction. This third stage of symbol evolution involves bringing two objectively associated perspectives together within one experience, or experience sequence. The third stage is the internalization of standard first and second person positions associated with routine gestures, through what Mead called "the significant symbol." Significant symbols were explained by Mead through the idea of responding to one's own act. Using the terminology of currency in his day, Mead tried to explain the significant symbol with the terms "stimulus" and "response." The idea is that organisms in the first person position that direct a gesture toward other group members stimulate the routine response they expect from the other within themselves. Mead placed much emphasis on the auditory portions of gestures in order to explain this. Because an emitted sound will generally be heard by the organism emitting it almost as soon as it is emitted, and because it will be heard in a way similar to the way it is heard by this same organism when others make such a sound toward her, it makes sense to think that this acting organism will respond to her own sound through her learned second person expectations. The acting organism will experience the same routine response, now stimulated by the sounds of her own act, that she has learned when other group members make this same sort of sound toward her. She responds to her own gesture in a way "identical" to the way the fellow group member she addresses will respond to it, because the sound is part of a routine gesture that all group members emit at times and to which all group members respond at times. When she</page><page sequence="76">Four Scenes 193 responds to her own gesture identically to the response of the one she addresses, the significant symbol is born. The organism has stimulated the "attitude of the other" within herself. She has acted from the first person position with expectations that the organism in second person position will respond in a certain way, and she has stimulated this response of the second person position within herself. Of course, by "identical response" Mead did not mean that the organism in first person position responds with identical behavior. Our mythical dog does not snarl at another and then retreat herself. Rather, Mead named the response called forth in the actor by her own act an "implicit response." Through something like a neurological delay, the self-stimulated response takes place but is barred from behavioral expression. Something within either the subjective experiences of the two organisms or the neurological states of the two organisms, or both, is identical. The behaviors of the two organisms are distinctive. Once the significant symbol has evolved, all sorts of important developmental paths are now open for exploration. The signifi- cant symbol, in Mead's dialogical theory, becomes a foundation for the development of thought and self-consciousness. Self- consciousness may grow from the experience of significant symbols because they make it possible to experience one's self as others do; to experience one's own acts as others experience them. When internalizations generalize a "me" forms: a general way of understanding one's self across many interactive domains by assuming the position of others to one's self. As the "me" develops, so does an "I": the experience of one's self primarily from the first person position that is now differentiated from the experiences of one's self had by others. The "me" is the self from the second person perspective, the "I" is the self from the first person perspective, and a growing differentiation between these two modes of experiencing the self evolves in time. Consistent understandings of one's self from the perspective of others develops in conjunction with the formation of "generalized others": another important concept we owe to Mead. Generalized others constitute systems of values and norms, as well as</page><page sequence="77">194 Essay Three identities and roles, and are thus fundamental to symbolic cultures. Hence the significant symbol is a crucial concept to Mead's dialogical theory of mind, self, and society. The emergence of significant symbols in evolutionary time gives birth to genuine intersubjectivity that in turn makes possible the development of symbolic communication, thought, reflection, self-consciousness, social identity, values, and norms. Any flaws in Mead's theory of the significant symbol could be lethal to his dialogical, intersubjective model of consciousness and meaning. Rethinking Mead There are flaws in Mead's basic theory of the significant symbol, but they are not actually lethal to his dialogical theory of meaning and self-consciousness. Flaws and Remedies Basic Flaws First, Mead's arguments shift ambiguously between objectivist modes of explanation and quasi-phenomenological modes of explanation. The stimulus-response vocabulary used by Mead provides us with an objectivist framework. The crucial notion of "taking the attitude of the other" is hard to understand without a framework that acknowledges subjective states. This is quasi- phenomenological because it requires a third person perspective but invites the theorist and her readers into the subjective states of others. It invites them to imagine these subjective states as they would appear to these others from their first person perspective. It is therefore not objectivist but quasi-phenomenological. Many terms used by Mead fall between these two frameworks; in particular, "expectation," "implicit response," and "significant symbol." At bottom is an assumed equation between objective states and subjective states: neurological activations and experience. Thus we are invited to make sense of the concept of "implicit response" through some notion of neurological delay. The brain is supposed to respond just as it does when a behavior is produced but, through a neurological delay, this behavior is not</page><page sequence="78">Four Scenes 195 actually produced, which makes the response "implicit." What, then, is the relevance of such a response if no behavior comes forth in relation to it? It must be the subjective experience it gives rise to. But we are not in a position, even with contemporary theories of the brain and mind, to make such a simplistic equation between brain states and experience. Second, Mead's concept of the significant symbol is inadequate because it depends on the notion of "identical response." Within Mead's phylogenetic story, significant symbols emerge as soon as an act stimulates a response in the actor that is identical to the response it stimulates in the organism addressed. At this point in the story, a gesture acquires a rudimentary meaning that is identical for both organisms. Meaning is equated with response. Several levels of identity are conflated in this explanation. From a third person perspective, two brain states are supposed to be identical. But these two brain states are in fact only subsets of total brain states that must differ a great deal in terms of their totality. Within the overall brain state of an organism under attack, the retreat response is activated. Within the very different overall brain state of an organism attacking, this same retreat response is activated. This is one level of identity: the physiological. From a first person perspective, each organism has an experience that is identical; the experience "retreat" that matches the actions of one organism but not the actions of the other organism. This experience of "retreat" could at best be a subset of holistic experiences that differ enormously when considered as totalities. The overall subjective state of one under attack is completely different from the overall subjective state of one who is attacking. This is a second level of identity: the experiential, or subjective. On a third level, there is supposed to be an identical meaning for both organisms. Together, the identical brain state and the identical subjective experience (both located within entirely different total brain states and subjective experiences) are supposed to give rise to an identical meaning. But for a gesture to mean the same thing to two organisms, for a gesture to be a communicative symbol, it must presuppose, within the experience of</page><page sequence="79">196 Essay Three the participants, identical interpretations for both. It must be experienced as intersubjective. Simply experiencing a gesture in the same way, or having brain states activated by a gesture that are the same, will not deliver an intersubjective identity. A significant symbol would have to either deliver the experience that the other interprets it as the actor does, or be constituted by an implicit assumption that the other interprets it as the actor does. I will have more to say about the difference between these two modes of intersubjectivity later in this essay. Here it need simply be noted that Mead's scheme in no way delivers an intersubjective identity. Actual identities in either brain states or subjective experiences do not automatically generate an experienced or assumed identity of meaning. The concept of "identical meaning" cannot be equated to the concepts of identical brain states or identical experiences. It cannot be equated with "identical responses." This is why human beings can communicate with chimpanzees. We do not assume that chimpanzees have identical brain states to our own nor do we assume that they have identical experiences. Yet the gestures we use count as having the same meaning for each of us in both our experiences. This is also why we can imagine developing communications between ourselves and aliens whose experiential states and physiological states differ entirely from our own. Our symbols in this case need not even be objectively similar (sound from us, perhaps light emissions from them); but they would count as having the same meaning. Though the phylogenesis of significant symbols is not the same sort of situation one is in when developing communication with chimpanzees and aliens (because the phylogenesis of symbolic communication must begin without one or both parties already possessing communicative competence), the end result is still the same. The end product is that of intersubjective identity - identical meanings that in essence require nothing identical on the experiential and physiological levels. All that is required on the subjective level is a correlation in patterns of experience. Two major flaws, then, exist in Mead's phylogenetic story. One is the confusion of objectivistic and quasi-phenomenological</page><page sequence="80">Four Scenes 197 frameworks; the other is the equation of identical meaning with identical response. These two major flaws give rise to many other sorts of flaws if one probes them sufficiently. For example, if identical meaning is supposed to be based on identical responses, then the rise of a significant symbol could occur for the actor when her own gesture self-stimulates the same response experienced by the one gestured toward; but it would not be a significant symbol for the one gestured toward, because it would not stimulate the first person experience in this second person. To remain within Mead's framework, a "theory patch" would be required to explain the development of significant symbols from the second person position. Another secondary flaw has already been alluded to. Since the total brain states and the total subjective states of both organisms in Mead's story would be very different, exactly how would identities between subsets in either of them have significance? The flaw in this case is an absence of theory needed to connect subsets of neurological states to intersubjective identity. One could find other secondary flaws that derive from the two fundamental flaws discussed above. But since these problems stem from the identification of meaning with response and the conflation of objectivistic theory with quasi-phenomenological theory, I will proceed directly to a discussion of how one might avoid these two most fundamental problems. Basic Remedies Here are my basic remedies to Mead's story in truncated form. First, I recommend discarding all simplistic equations between brain states and subjective experiences. This sort of problematic equation is not unique to Mead; many philosophers from Descartes onward have unknowingly done the same thing (see Chalmers 1997 for a good discussion of this). Let's tell Mead's story primarily from the quasi-phenomenological perspective. The quasi-phenomenological perspective is a third person perspective that nevertheless emphasizes the imagined subjective states of others. As brain theories progress it will no doubt be possible, some day, to retell Mead's story once again from an objectivist</page><page sequence="81">198 Essay Three perspective, up to the point at which subjective experiences must be considered in their own terms, and then move ahead with the confidence that subjective experiences have some known relationship to neurological activations. At present brain science is not developed enough to attempt something like this. Second, let's drop the equation between meaning and response. In a quasi-phenomenological perspective there is no need to think of meanings in terms of responses. One of Mead's great insights was to emphasize acts rather than perceptions in his theory of the evolution of meaning. We must continue to emphasize acts, but acts as the actor experiences them, and acts as experienced by those who receive them. An act need not be conceived as a response nor as anything framed within an objectivist framework alone. Third, let's treat the concept of identical meaning in terms of assumed intersubjective identities. Mead was well aware of the need to explain the rise of meaningful symbols in terms of identities established for the organisms under consideration, but he based the emergence of such identities on the concept of identical responses. That does not work. The rise of a significant symbol will occur when one organism acts in expectation of a certain sort of response from another organism, and this expectation is constituted by an unconscious assumption that something is the same for both organisms. Now, what will be unconsciously assumed to be identical by the actor when significant symbols arise? Not necessarily the interpretation of her act: not at first. Rather, this unconscious assumption may well first manifest itself at the level of a typical interactive sequence: something like a social typification. Acts and responses to acts are shared within the cultures of social animals, but so are action sequences like a snarl followed by a snarl-back followed by a feint followed by an attack. Typical interactive sequences, or "social typifications," could have been the first assumed identities in the evolution of significant symbols. One very plausible story for the evolution of significant symbols will place the first emergence of intersubjective identity at the level of</page><page sequence="82">Four Scenes 199 wholes (social contexts), rather than parts (specific acts). I will clarify this idea later. A New Version of Mead's Story The basic plot of first person expectations, followed by second person expectations, followed by significant symbols can be retold without reducing the concept of meaning to that of an identical response and without conflating objectivist and quasi-phenomen- ological frameworks. Doing so will give us a plausible dialogical theory of how significant symbols may have evolved. Caveats However, this retold story will not be as tight as Mead's. There will not be a single step, as there is in Mead's story, that projects us in a sort of quantum leap from mere expectations to significant symbols. There will rather be several possible ways in which significant symbols could have developed. The new story will be suggestive but not definitive. Moreover, it will not be final or complete. There will still be many unanswered questions at the end of this revised story. Best, I think, to be clear about these unanswered questions before getting on with the tale. Here is the main one: Mead's plot depends on symmetrical relationships between the key actors. Competitive behaviors between adults of roughly equal developmental status are emphasized so that a gesture will eventually come to stimulate the same response in the actor as in the one acted toward. The equal developmental status of the participants makes it possible for a self-stimulation of this nature to arise, because the actor who self-stimulates must have had previous experience with the position of the other in the interaction. In the case of attacking and retreating, the one who self-stimulates a retreat response while attacking or snarling must have previously been in the position of having to retreat so that she is able to self-stimulate this learned response. The new version of the story that I shall tell does not depend on an identical response, but it does depend on a typical interaction characterized by symmetry. The actor who self-stimulates in my</page><page sequence="83">200 Essay Three story will stimulate a response learned through real experiences with the complementary interactive position. It will not matter, in my story, whether the actual organism in the second person position has similar experiences to those of the actor or not, because the identical meaning need only be assumed, not actual. But it will matter that a typical interaction be in place that allows for the organism in question to play both roles. The interaction will be symmetrical. What if significant symbols first developed between mothers and infants rather than between adults at similar developmental stages? An infant will have had no previous experience with the complementary position of the mother. My retold story will not explain the evolution of significant symbols in the case of asymmetrical interactions like these. It is therefore possible that my new story is far off the mark with respect to the actual emergence of significant symbols. It is also possible that significant symbols first evolved in a way consistent with this story, and then, once evolved, symbolic behavior became learned by infants through other mechanisms, given a symbolic- ally competent mother. I am in no position to argue for one possibility over another. What, then, is the value of the following theory sketch? I believe that no matter how close or far it is from the actual evolution of significant symbols, it will do much to reveal structures of meaningful action from this scene three perspective. Various ideas presented in this story could well have a place in alternative stories. That is its value. Its results correlate well with purely phenomenological investigations of meaningful action. The new story could stimulate further speculations about significant symbol evolution in asymmetrical relationships. It could stimulate empirical research about learning in human infants and animals. It is worth setting to paper for these reasons. In the next major section, then, I will rework Mead's story in an effort to avoid the flaws in his original work. At the end of the story I will summarize what it suggests about the evolution of intersubjectivity. Some readers might want to skim through my new version of the story and concentrate on the ending summary.</page><page sequence="84">Four Scenes 201 All readers must bear the limitations of this theory sketch in mind as they read through it. Action Impeti and Expectations Now I am going to retell Mead's story with more attention to its subjective, phenomenological side. This will bring the concept of the action impetus, introduced much earlier in this essay, into scene number three. The notion of action impeti was introduced in my section on the phenomenology of meaningful action. From the first person perspective of a fully socialized adult human being, an action impetus can be phenomenologically identified and analytically separated into proprioceptive and prekinesthetic configurations, implicit I-feeling modes, desires, and expectations that include preunderstood perspectives on the act as others would experience it. Phenomenologically, an impetus has a singular quality, yet these diverse components may be identified through further phenomenological recollections. The concept of an action impetus happens to fit very well with the third person, objectifying perspective of brain and mind theory. A stimulated brain consists of simultaneous parallel processes that "interpret" a given situation in multiple, often competing ways. A mind organizes some of the neurological interpretations into composites and chains. Though the brain and mind together generally produce a number of competing interpretations, each capable of informing diverse behavioral responses, one such interpretation wins the ensuing contest for dominance and gains expression in action. Other interpretations may be employed to form memories and still others simply die out without effect. This view of the brain and the mind is consistent with Daniel Dennett's "multiple drafts" model of consciousness and is supported by a variety of experimental evidence (Dennett 1991). The phenomenological experience that we adult humans can have of sensing an action impetus but not allowing it to express itself in order to favor another action correlates well enough with this objective model of the brain and mind. There is no need to</page><page sequence="85">202 Essay Three assume a direct relationship between subjective experiences and brain /mind processes to find this correlation suggestive. The competition between neurological interpretations, such that one wins out, does indeed correlate with phenomenological experi- ences, and one can safely assume that this correlation is significant in some as yet unknown way. The multiple drafts model of consciousness correlates with the common subjective experience of having more than one action impetus at hand during a short period of time. Within experience human beings are capable of noticing action impeti as phenomena before they erupt into action or thought. I can experience an impulse, while writing, to go to the kitchen. I can subjectively notice this impulse but not act on it, bringing my concentration back to writing. My impulse to go to the kitchen lost in the competition with an impulse to resume writing. Such impulses are "impeti." The impetus to go to the kitchen is organized as a complex project with many subprojects and acts, but it is experienced in a singular fashion. I notice it but I do not act on it. It loses in the competition with other action impeti that I also notice phenomenologically in holistic, singular ways. I can similarly experience an impulse to stop writing in order to think about something different and unrelated to my writing project. I am in a room with a fire burning to keep me warm. The fire reminds me of a time in this room I spent with my son, playing a game. I notice a desire to think about that time, for it would be pleasurable, but I do not; I return to writing. To think about that time would be to allow quasi-linguistic modes of thought to be expressed, which I first sense in holistic form. Thoughts also arise as impeti, organized into projects and subprojects. Other organisms could be expected to have a similar capability, especially those with brains of complex design, and particularly with respect to actions rather than thoughts. In the speculations that follow, I begin with very rudimentary assumptions about the first person experiences of organisms who will soon develop significant symbols. I will retell Mead's story by alternating between the first person phenomenological perspective and</page><page sequence="86">Four Scenes 203 various objective considerations. I will take Mead's fantasy of mythical dogs and start where he starts, with the formation of second person expectations. Readers should recall the basic plot of this story: dogs attacked by other dogs learn to retreat when they experience the beginning portions of a routine attack behavior made toward themselves. Second Person Expectation So let's again take the case of an organism, a neurologically complex mammal, that has been repeatedly attacked by other organisms of its own kind. It learns to expect the results of an attack upon its body when experiencing the beginning portions of the attack. By acquiring this expectation, it becomes capable of avoiding consequences by retreating before the attacker can reach it. For heuristic purposes only we can divide this sequence of events into three parts: the beginning of an attack, the point at which the attack produces pain for the one attacked, and the retreat of the one attacked so as to remove itself from pain. Many neurological events would be taking place simultaneously within the animal attacked during all three segments of this sequence. The brain would be processing smells, sights, tactile sensations, kinesthetic sensations, and proprioceptive sensations continu- ously. Multiple neurological interpretations15 derived from integrations of these sensations would arise in a continuous manner as well. Multiple neurological processes would accompany each segment of this sequence. Let's assume that pain sensations, which are added to the sequence during segment number two, quite automatically produce a "flight" response on the level of behavior. As soon as there is pain, flight follows. Segment two produces segment three. The neurological activities associated with this sort of pain and is Whenever I write of "neurological interpretations" I do not mean reflective or even experienced interpretations. Contemporary philosophers interested in the mind and the brain consider an interpretation of this sort to be a physiological response to the brain state (Dennett 1991). The response may not be experienced by the organism. I use the expression "neurological interpretations" in this sense.</page><page sequence="87">204 Essay Three the neurological activities associated with flight are linked: the first brings about the second. The subjective experience of pain is linked to the subjective experience of flight. The neurological activities stimulated by the beginning of the attack are not initially linked to the neurological activities associated with pain and those associated with flight. The subjective experiences produced by the beginning of the attack (hearing, seeing, smelling the first moves of the other dog's attack) are not initially linked to the subjective experience of pain nor to the subjective experiences of flight. Acquisition of the expectation would amount to the forging of a new link. In the brain, some of the neurological processes that the beginning of the attack stimulate within the organism assaulted now call forth the flight behavior. A sequence that originally consisted of three roughly hewn segments now becomes a two- segment sequence; the original middle term has seemingly been removed. A new link would also have been forged phenomenologically through this expectation, but not exactly through the removal of the middle term. Before I discuss what may take place within the experience of the organism, I will introduce the concept of "compression" with respect to the objective features of this learning process. Objective Compression Objectively, a sort of compression has occurred when a second person expectation is acquired. On the level of observable interactions that take routine sequences, one sequence has been compressed by removing a middle term. Originally the beginning of an attack was followed by an actual assault upon the body of the one attacked, and this was followed by flight. Now the beginning of an attack is simply followed by the flight of the dog addressed. The sequence has compressed. On the level of brain and mind, neurological processes have received a new "interpretation" by calling forth an action that had not been previously associated with them. These neurological processes, those associated with sensory information that arise from the beginning of an attack made toward one prior to the time</page><page sequence="88">Four Scenes 205 at which one is usually bitten and scratched, once had a sort of accidental connection with the flight response; a connection that did not exist within the brain or mind of the organism but one that an observer could have noted as part of a routine temporal sequence. With the new interpretation, the temporal compression is achieved and a noncontingent relationship is formed between neurological processes aroused by the beginning of another's attack and neurological processes corresponding to the flight behavior. This temporal compression is also a neurological internalization. The objectively observable connection between the beginning of an attack and the consequences of the attack (including both the effects on the one attacked and the retreat response) now have a neurological representation. Subjective, or Somatic, Compression Within the experience of the organism a new link is also forged by the acquisition of an expectation, but not necessarily through the full removal of a middle term. A compression has occurred subjectively as well, but with a reduced form of the middle term compressed within the impetus for flight. Let me explain in more detail what I have in mind. When I was in elementary school I often played football informally with my friends. My position on our informal teams was usually that of the end, because I wasn't bad at catching passes. On one occasion I found myself running with my head turned toward the quarterback to be ready for a pass. On this particular day I caught the pass, turned my head forward to keep running for the goal line, and discovered a tree smack in my path, inches away from my face. I could not halt my drive forward and smashed my face painfully into the tree. From that day until the present I still "feel" a diminished version of the pain caused by the collision whenever I discover myself moving quickly with my head turned away from what is in front of me. This "pain" I call pre-pain because it is not literally painful but bears a resemblance to the original pain I felt and warns me that precisely those areas of my body in which the sensations are located may indeed register actual pain within moments.</page><page sequence="89">206 Essay Three The pre-pain I now routinely feel when in this situation causes me to stop in an automatic nonreflective way and turn my head to see what is there. When I smashed into that tree the pain I experienced in the face immediately followed the turning of my head. The nearly automatic response I learned from that experience is to stop first and then turn my head carefully because I feel a pre-pain sensation in my face. I also sort of cringe from the neck up. There are many similar experiences in my own phenomen- ological life that I suspect are common enough for other people. Some such experiences are totally analogous to the beginning of an attack described by Mead. I was once hit in the face by a baseball and I still feel a pre-pain sensation and cringing response anytime I see someone raising their arm as if to throw a ball toward me within a certain maximum distance. The beginning portions of ball throws beyond that distance will not cause me to cringe and feel pre-pain. But the beginning of a ball throw within that distance will cause the sensations. I must overcome an impetus to duck and hold my hands in front of my face whenever I am in such situations if I want to actually catch a ball. Another accident I had when young was to clip one of my fingers with a shears. Whenever I see a similar pair of shears I feel quasi-painful sensations in my fingers and experience an impetus, which I usually block, to pull my fingers together and put my hands behind my back. The exact place on the exact finger that was clipped almost throbs when I see such shears. This is the subjective side of compressions related to the acquisition of an expectation. Roughly speaking, we again have three temporal segments. The three segments are differentiated in my phenomenological world in terms of subjective states. Let me concentrate for the moment on my experience of smashing my face into a tree. The three segments are as follows: 1) there are sensations corresponding to the first segment that are mainly kinesthetic and proprioceptive produced by running with my head turned backwards, 2) there is the experience of having my face hurt, 3) there are experiences that correspond to my response to the pain: cringing and pulling my face back.</page><page sequence="90">Four Scenes 207 Once the lesson was learned, the subjective experiences that correspond to the first temporal segment quickly elicit a somatic memory of what it was like to experience the second temporal segment (pre-pain) and also to quickly bring about behavioral responses to the pre-pain (cringing, pulling the face in, and an impetus to stop running). This is very rudimentary learning, and the subjective com- ponents of it are primarily somatic sensations of various sorts. Three phenomenological temporal periods are compressed into two; the middle term is literally compressed into the third. The sensations associated with the first temporal period now quickly give rise to reduced sensations of the middle period which are simultaneously experienced with an impulse to respond (cringe, pull the face in). The middle phenomenological term in this sequence is not removed to produce the compression, it rather arises in reduced form as pre-pain and is experienced as compressed within the next moment and as a part of it. Thus I call the subjective side of learning experiences like these "somatic compression." Couldn't a dog or another mammal experience something similar when learning that the sensations associated with the beginning of an attack made toward her will quickly be followed by pain and the impulse to retreat? Dogs, Mead's favorite example, often act as if they have learned through a somatic compression. Some dogs cringe and cry out whenever they simply see a stick in a human's hand. They also back off. Obviously, they must have been beaten with sticks in the past. They have learned that seeing the stick in a human's hand precedes the pain caused by a stick striking their bodies. They have learned this through the temporal compression of three "moments." They don't think they will be hit with the stick, when they see it in the human's hand, they act as if they feel a somatic memory of what it is like to be hit and simultaneously back off. It is reasonable to assume that they feel pre-pain, just as I do when someone raises an arm as if to throw a ball to me. The learning process is much like that undergone by Pavlov's dogs. The body of a dog trained in this way responds with</page><page sequence="91">208 Essay Three salivation to events repeatedly experienced prior to being fed (the ringing bell). The body of the dog who has repeatedly been attacked responds with pre-pain sensations and then cringes and /or runs away. The pre-pain is compressed into the impetus to retreat. Expectations as Somatic Compressions An expectation of the sort Mead was concerned with would have a somatic compression as its subjective side. In a presymbolic but neurologically complex organism, "to expect" is not to have a certain kind of "thought," in the sense of a reflection or a deduction. It is rather to experience a state much like those I experience with shears and baseballs. The term "expectation" is logically tied to temporal progression: one segment of time becomes associated with a moment still to come. The second moment is expected. Before thought, reflection, and deduction can evolve, the way that the second moment is expected subjectively is to experience a somatic memory like pre-pain. Use of the term "compression" in relation to the objective perspective on learning processes may have little value, though it is logically consistent and metaphorically sound (enough) to employ the term that way. Use of the term "compression" in relation to the subjective perspective, by contrast, provides us with a very useful construct. An expectation is experienced when three somatic states that were originally separated in time come to be experienced all at once, or during a short temporal duration. Seeing/hearing/ smelling the beginning of an attack gives rise to pre-pain/ cringing sensations and the impulse (felt kinesthetically and proprioceptively) to run. The second two terms are experient- ially compressed. The subjective side of rudimentary expectations involve somatic compressions. The Presymbol as a Somatic Compression Now we can better capture the subjective side of a presymbol. Somatic compression, the pre-pain and cringing sensations closely associated with the impetus to retreat, provides the organism with a somatic state that implicitly stands for the full experience of</page><page sequence="92">Four Scenes 209 being attacked and the full experience of fleeing. A symbol is something that stands for something else. In the case of rudimentary expectations, the sensations experienced stand for something else because the subjective portions of this "something else" are compressed into one temporal segment. The truncated attack of one dog toward another stimulates sensations of pre- pain and the impetus to flee, compressed together. This is an implicit symbol because for the organism it is simply an experience. The relation of this experience to other experiences and events is not explicitly "grasped." Within Mead's original framework, second person expectation implicitly constructs the beginning portions of the act addressed toward one as a presymbol. That is, Mead considered the beginning of the attack to be a presymbol that implicitly represents the full act and its consequences. But what are the beginning portions of the act for the organism in second person position? The beginning of the attack would not be as we, adult and fully socialized human beings, conceive of it. It would not be the sights and sounds of a snarl abstracted from the smells and visceral responses felt by an organism actually about to be assaulted. It would rather be the subjective side of a dominant neurological interpretation, probably made objectively through "software" processes of a mind, felt subjectively as somatic sensations and an impetus to flee. The presymbol would be the pre-pain sensations and the cringing response, compressed toward a felt impetus to flee. This roughly organized complex of sensation would be the implicit symbol. Therefore, to call the beginning portions of the attack the presymbol is not incorrect. But it is through the expectation as felt by the organism in second person position that the beginning of the attack takes on symbolic value. Indeed, for the organism about to be attacked, the beginning of the attack is nothing other than the way this organism experiences it. The evolution of this presymbol toward an actual symbol, for an organism that is capable of experiencing pre-pain and other sorts of somatic memories, would occur on the side of the subjective sensations.</page><page sequence="93">210 Essay Three First Person Expectation First person expectation considered within the limited confines of this paradigmatic fantasy takes place after second person expectations have been learned and widely distributed among members of the group. A dog who attacks will then frequently have the experience of an opponent who retreats. This will result in a learning process: beginning an attack ought to produce a response of retreat. In time, the beginning of an attack can be committed as an act in itself, constituted by the expectation of driving another dog off. What would acquisition of a first person expectation be like phenomenologically, from the perspective of the organism acquiring it? Once again, three temporal segments would become compressed. In the case of certain types of first person learning experiences, many of the arguments I used in my speculations about second person expectations would directly apply. A dog who learns that jumping through a hoop will result in receiving food might begin to salivate as well as jump when seeing the hoop, anticipating the reward that will come after acting in the required way. The temporal segments of seeing the hoop, jumping through the hoop, and receiving food are not compressed, in this case, but are rather linked together for the first time. Objectively no compression has occurred. But subjectively, presensations of the final term in the sequence are compressed to the impulse for jumping. The presensations of having food become aroused by the experience of a hoop, and the middle term, jumping through, quickly follows. A phenomenol- ogical link has been forged between three distinct experiences, and somatic memories of the final state are compressed to an impulse for acting out the middle segment. Somatic compression has occurred, but a somatic memory of the last segment in the sequence is now aroused by the first segment and is compressed with the impetus to act out the middle term. First person expectations are distinguishable from second person expectations through this directly teleological component: the act is produced in order to attain a desired state, rather than to avoid undesirable consequences.</page><page sequence="94">Four Scenes 211 When a learning process has taken place, such that the desired state is anticipated to be attained through an action that is not "hardwired" to the desire, then somatic compression would explain the subjective side of the learning process. Presensations of the desired state arise, compressed with the act that will produce the full sensations. Expectation is once again a somatic presensation compressed with an impetus to act. So much for hoops and food; what about attacks? Learning to truncate an attack so as to drive off another dog would plausibly involve similar sorts of compressions. But the situation in this case is a little more complicated because the organisms under consideration would have to first learn that it is desirable to drive off another dog without actually attacking it. This is a restriction of the fantasy as here composed, for we are introducing first person expectations as a development subsequent to second person expectations. The primal acts of this story are attacking and fleeing. Second person expectation produces fleeing before an attack can be completed. Dogs who attack must go through a learning period in which they have the experience of their attacks failing, frequently, because their opponent has run off before they could reach her. They must learn that the state of having simply driven a dog off is desirable before they will start to truncate their attacks in expectation of it. So let us simply assume that this has occurred. The ending state experienced after another dog has retreated must feel good in some way. If attacks are the result of a sense of threat that is felt when another is too close, then the state of driving off the offender would indeed feel good. The sense of threat would be dispelled with the departure of the offending animal. Probably some steps would be involved in learning the full first person expectation. First, there is discovery that having a dog run off is desirable. Second, the somatic memory of this desirable state repeatedly arises during a full attack when seeing the other dog begin its retreat. In this step it is the beginning motions of the other dog's retreat that bring about the somatic memory, just as in second person expectation. Next, the attacking dog might halt its attack as soon as it sees the other dog begin a retreat because of</page><page sequence="95">212 Essay Three the somatic memory arising within. Lastly, this somatic memory is compressed within the impetus to attack itself, such that the attack behavior becomes truncated by the expectation of a desired ending state. At the end of this series of steps, compression has constituted a new act, the snarl. First Person Expectation as a Presymbol The somatic anticipation that constitutes the impetus to snarl would represent the retreat of the other dog as it is routinely experienced by the snarling dog. So the presymbol constituted by first person expectation is the felt impetus to snarl, derived from several stages of somatic compression. Such an anticipation would be experienced somatically as the presensations of greater social distance and the lessening of a sense of threat produced by close proximity. The presymbol is thus teleological in nature, consider- ed from the first person perspective. The action impetus would involve presensations of the state to be arrived at when a full snarl is acted out that causes the addressee to move away. The snarl impetus, if it could be stopped in time and phenomenologically analyzed, would include proprioceptive configurations associated with the threat posed by a dog in proximity, prekinesthetic sensations of the snarl (formed as a truncation of the kinesthetics of full attack), and somatically represented expectations of greater social distance after acting. The telos of the snarl would have a somatic representation in the constitution of the impetus; presensations of what it is like to have the other dog move away, compressed into the moment the impetus arises. The gesture is partially constituted by its telos. It is an early form of goal-rational action in social contexts, and it has a "premonitored" component. Within the impetus to gesture itself are sensations that anticipate a subjective state to come that is to result from the response of the other organism to the gesture. Simultaneous Impeti Because the same basic "stimuli" would activate both the attack impetus and the snarl impetus, experiences of having two action impeti emerge within one's self, but consequent movement that</page><page sequence="96">Four Scenes 213 corresponds to only one of them, are now possible. In other words, because first person expectation constitutes a new act through the truncation of a more primal act, the experience could occur of having two possible acts, two impeti to act, arising simultaneously with one more dominant than the other. Such experiences of simultaneous impeti would establish conditions for subjectively noting the difference between an action impetus and the action it would lead to. The impetus not acted out, because another impetus was somehow dominant, would be implicitly experienced in distinction from its corresponding behaviors since these were not expressed. Something analogous could occur with second person responses too, but for different reasons: the organism attacked might experience both an impetus to flee and an impetus to attack back. Simultaneous action impeti ought to be a fairly common event for organisms of this complexity on the level of the brain and mind. Multiple, parallel, and continuous interpretations integrat- ed neurologically would be common in many diverse contexts of stimulation and action. The point of noting simultaneous impeti here is to arbitrarily mark off a point in time when competing responses are subjectively experienced. I believe that this develop- ment in the subjectivity of organisms will be important for understanding the development of significant symbols. Further Developments Prior to the Significant Symbol So now I have speculated about the development of second and first person expectations from a quasi-phenomenological perspect- ive. The next stage in Mead's theory is the emergence of a significant symbol. But I do not feel ready for this next big step. For reasons clarified a little later on, I believe that other developments must be considered before a credible tale may be constructed about significant symbols. Elaboration of Action Repertoire Let us imagine gesture-mediated interactions of the snarl variety to be routinely exhibited within a group of organisms belonging to one species. Somatic compression has occurred in relation to</page><page sequence="97">214 Essay Three routine acts as they are experienced from both the first and second person positions, that lead up to the emergence of gestures. Snarls routinely produce retreating behaviors. All organisms learn to snarl as well as retreat. Over time second person expectations would further evolve such that a snarl would no longer produce the expectation of being bitten while it would continue to elicit retreating behaviors. A "snarl" evolves to the status of an implicit symbol for submission: moving out of the way, or retreating partially, without an intense expectation of being attacked. A new form of "retreat" would in this way be added to the action repertoire of the group. There would be "real retreats" exhibited when real attacks are expected, and "figurative retreats" exhibited in expectation that an attack will not take place. Gesture-mediated interactions would evolve, in this way, through stages that produce a variety of routine "conversations of gestures" as Mead called it. Somatic compression would continue to be the primary process that evolves more complex forms of gesture and gesture conversation. Somatic configurations would modify and diversify as the gesture and response repertoire elaborates. Impetus Clusters Through processes like these, the experience of having several competing action impeti arise within one's self would become more and more common in both the second and first person positions. For the second person position, retreat or snarl back or attack back are examples of simultaneous response impeti. Full dodges and feints would evolve through steps like these, characterized by multiple action impeti. When competing impeti are stimulated by a gesture, some of them will have to be ignored in order to favor one. Or, perhaps more accurately, one will have experiential dominance over the others. Producing a snarl back instead of a retreat could stimulate competing response impeti in the organism that snarled first, and the experience of one dominant impetus differentiated from other simultaneous impeti would occur in this case as well.</page><page sequence="98">Four Scenes 215 The experience of "going with" one action impetus as opposed to others that were stimulated would establish an important condition for internalizing gesture-mediated interactions. For one thing, it would greatly elaborate the action repertoire of the organisms and complexify patterns of "gesture conversation." For another, it would gradually make the differentiation between an impetus and the action it would produce increasingly separate experiences. Finally, it would introduce experientially differentiat- ed impeti within clusters. Experientially differentiated impeti could well be preconditions for identifying acts communicatively. Given one impetus cluster as context, a single possible act could be identified or even indicated through its contrasts to other possible acts in the cluster. The identification or indication of specific acts, of course, could only occur much later in the developmental process. But the impetus cluster may well be an important precondition. Readiness Positions Another development during the phase of the elaboration of gesture-mediated interactions would be learning processes associated with the ambiguity of responses to a gesture. A snarl could produce a retreat, a symbolic retreat, a snarl back, or an attack back. Regular use of snarls would produce repeated experiences with all of these responses. Somatic anticipations that constitute the snarl impetus could well become shaded in intensity and inclusive of several possible ending states. Gesture- mediated interactions, over time, would objectively link gestures to clustered responses instead of to single responses. Gestures themselves would become complexly constituted through anticipations of several possible responses. A gesture could be made and then followed with a stance of readiness: a posture that facilitates several possible second acts that would depend on the response of the addressee. Dogs often adopt readiness positions. If I crouch within the gaze of my dog Ginger she will crouch back and stare at me intently. She is in a readiness position. In fact, my crouch is also taking a readiness position, to which she responds with her own position of</page><page sequence="99">216 Essay Three readiness. Ginger is in a state of readiness for a bounded set of possible acts I may commit next. The readiness position is not simply an act but is rather the adoption of a state composed of multiple somatic anticipations compressed together. The readiness position is something like a role. Within the state of readiness taken on by a dog there are several action impeti ready to erupt into action depending upon what the other does next. Any of the possible acts that could be committed from a readiness position would be consistent with the "role" adopted. Gesture Chains The formation of gesture conversations could be expected to develop into routine patterns of gesture/countergesture/new gesture. I call these "gesture chains." Dog behavior remains a good example of this. A snarl is responded to by a snarl back followed by a figurative attack followed by a jump toward a more easily defended position followed by a figurative retreat and so on. Dogs and other mammals exhibit such gesture chains frequently. The sequence of events in any actual gesture conversation would not be fixed. Rather, the chain would be a loosely sequenced set of impetus clusters making possible many variations in real chains of gesture and response. The variations would be bounded: snarls stimulate only retreats, figurative retreats, submissive postures, counterattacks, countersnarls: they do not stimulate anything else. By gesture chain, then, I mean the routine experience of entering into a series of interactions characterized by the same impetus clusters. Though specific gestures and responses vary, and though the number of actual interactions that take place before the organisms go on to something else also vary, these variations occur within bounds. An organism receiving an initiating gesture would anticipate a forthcoming period of interaction that is familiar to it in its basic form. The readiness positions adopted as punctuations within the flow of interaction would most accurately represent the gesture chain, with its empirically variable but bounded acts. Other chain-</page><page sequence="100">Four Scenes 217 dependent action impeti could also represent the gesture chain, I do not mean to overemphasize readiness positions here. The readiness position is, however, particularly useful to illustrate the way in which an impetus cluster may become a presymbol for an entire gesture chain. Notice that first and second person positions in a gesture chain are rapidly shifted between the two organisms. Each organism occupies many first person positions and each occupies many second person positions during the course of a single chain. All members of the group would have regular experiences with both types of responses in such chains, and thus all members of the group would experience the rapid alternation between first and second person positions. The presymbols constituted would come to implicitly represent chained interactions inclusive of clustered gesture and response possibilities. Objective Social Typifications Presymbols of chained interactions, inclusive of clustered response possibilities, would tacitly represent the interactive situation as a whole, rather than single acts, consequences, and responses. Through somatic compressions, each moment of a gesture chain would anticipate, and thus implicitly stand for, several additional moves down the chain. Because of the ambiguity built into the situation that produces anticipations of response clusters rather than single responses, readiness positions along the chain would be particularly appropriate presymbols to represent the chain as a whole, though not the only impetus clusters capable of such representation. Readiness positions and other chain-dependent impetus clusters, in other words, would implicitly represent objective social typifications: entire situations in which routine gesture chains are exhibited. I call the gesture chain, viewed in terms of its potential for symbolic representation and internalization, an objective social typification in analogy to the term "objective meaning" used by ethologists. Routine gesture chains are objectively perceivable as typical social situations: typifications. But their existence would not be a conscious feature of the</page><page sequence="101">218 Essay Three experience of the organisms. They are, accordingly, objective social typifications. The rapid alternation between first and second person positions for each participant in a gesture chain would correspond to early role behavior. The subjective experience of taking on a "role" here would involve the somatics of readiness positions and other chain-dependent acts that anticipate several moves to come. Elaborated Gesture-Mediated Interaction: A Summary In summary, the stage of elaborated gesture-mediated interaction would introduce the following as common experiences to all members of the group: * the experience of an impetus cluster, in which several impeti to act are experienced at once but only one such impetus becomes behaviorally expressed * the experience of differentiations between action impeti arising within a cluster * the experience of ambiguity, of anticipating several possible responses after gesturing rather than just one * the experience of gesture chains in which both organisms rapidly shift between first and second person positions with respect to each other * the development of readiness positions in a gesture chain, experienced as special sorts of somatic configurations, and from which a bounded number of possible acts could be displayed * the development of early "roles" that are characterized by one's position in a typical chain rather than by a specific gesture or a specific response: several possible acts can be expected from one role</page><page sequence="102">Four Scenes 219 * the development of objective social typifications * the development of presymbols for objective social typifi- cations that would be the somatic state of a readiness position or of other chain-dependent impetus clusters The Significant Symbol Significant Gestures I will now examine more carefully how this developmental stage, the stage of elaborated gesture-mediated interaction, could lead to the development of significant symbols. Let's say that our group of organisms regularly interact through gesture chains that are basically objective social typifications. Let's take one such gesture chain, a competitive one similar to that of two dogs who snarl, attack, retreat, feint, and pause in readiness positions within the typification. Most impeti that arise within this chain are now constituted by multiple somatic compressions. A single impetus anticipates both: * a self-stimulated state to come that corresponds to the sensations that routinely occur when in the complementary position of the chain, and * a state to come next that the organism will adopt just after acting. Many times during the actual flow of interaction within this typical situation impetus clusters rather than single impeti will characterize the state of each participant. This is particularly evident when readiness positions are adopted, but this would occur at many other moments during the interaction as well. The future state that will be self-stimulated as well as the future state that will arise when the other responds to one's act will often be characterized by several action impeti on-hand, not just one. "Selection processes" of some sort must operate so that one impetus from a cluster will be expressed rather than its competitors. Each impetus in a cluster will be constituted by</page><page sequence="103">220 Essay Three multiple somatic compressions. What would the selection process be like, considered from the first person perspective of the organism? It is of course difficult to say. One impetus will simply have more experiential weight than the others in its cluster; its selection will immediately follow the experience of its greater weight. The next step that I imagine introduces an assumed identity. I call this step the development of a significant gesture. I retain "significant" from "significant symbol" because an identity is assumed when this arises, but I substitute "gesture" for symbol because no communicative intentions are yet involved. A significant gesture would arise at a time when one impetus is selected over others because of the anticipated self-stimulation. Perhaps a selection of this nature would occur when a somatic anticipation of the second variety - the state to adopt just after acting - feels best to the actor. It is through the anticipated self- stimulation compressed to this impetus that this most desirable outcome is felt. The new phenomenological link that gives rise to a significant gesture would involve anticipations of self- stimulation, associated with the complementary position within the chain and the subjective state that will follow one's act. As soon as something like this occurs, the actor has put an unconscious assumption in place: that the actual other organism shares the same typification with the actor. Given the ambiguity of responses to acts, and yet the bounded nature of this ambiguity; and given that the nature of responses will be those of impetus clusters rather than single acts; the assumption of identity would occur at the level of the typification rather than at the level of the single act. The implicit logic of a selection of this nature would have its fully explicated form as follows: "I could act out A, B, or C but I will act out B because then the other will probably respond with cluster Z and I will be ready for that. I think the other will respond with cluster Z because I would do so if I were in her position." In fact, the implicit logic of the particular impetus selection that constitutes significant gestures would be layered as follows:</page><page sequence="104">Four Scenes 221 1) "Impetus B feels best, better than impeti A and C." 2) "Impetus B will bring about anticipated state 2, which feels better than anticipated states 1 or 3 that would result from impeti A and C." 3) "I know that impetus B will bring about state 2 because it will self-stimulate state ii that I feel in connection with state 2." 4) "If I act out B, the other will probably respond with cluster Z which will give me the feeling 2. I expect the other to respond with Z if I act out B because I would do so (via state ii) if I were in her position." Notice that this process does not require identical responses or even identical experiences. It is the organism's own states that have been compressed and that connect complementary positions. The two organisms involved need not experience anything identical on any level considered. The core objective condition required is that of routine interactions that generate comple- mentary positions which both organisms have routinely occupied. In principle, responses and experiences could be totally different for each organism. However, given the fact that the gesture chains that we are considering developed within a group of the same species, a pattern of similar experiences would no doubt have arisen for all members. But identical responses and identical experiences are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for this process to occur. This same basic process could in principle take place between organisms of entirely different physiological structure. For the actor, however, an assumption has unconsciously been set in place that both organisms share the same typification: that the roles in which the other is located are the same as the roles the actor has occupied in the past. This unconscious nonreflective assumption makes the gesture a "significant gesture," one that assumes an intersubjective identity at the level of the typification.</page><page sequence="105">222 Essay Three And this unconscious assumption sets in place the implicit logic worked out above. That implicit logic would be instantiated at the moment this sort of selection occurs. The logic is to be regarded as entirely implicit, of course. Its mark in experience is simply on the level of feeling states and experiential weights. But once it is set in place, the ground for a long process of differentiation and explication is established for the first time. This will be a process that will lead to subject- subject frames in experience and, eventually, a fully evolved symbolic system. Significant Symbols With this scenario in mind further developments may be imagined that would refine early significant gestures toward significant symbols. I am roughly defining significant symbol here to mean a significant gesture that also possesses communicative intent. Remember that I have defined a significant gesture as one constituted by an (unconsciously made) assumption of inter- subjective identity. The assumption that has unknowingly been made by our mythical organisms is that both participants in a gesture chain share an identical "definition of the situation," to use the terminology of symbolic interactionists. This assumption was developed through somatic compressions that linked together portions of each organism's own experiences, compres- sing them into singular action impeti. Therefore, the two organisms in question need not actually share a common situation definition at all. Moreover, they need not have identical or even similar experiences. And finally, they need not have identical or even similar brain states. The significant symbol also requires nothing identical in the actual experiences or brain responses of the participating organisms. It is a significant gesture accompanied by communi- cative intentions. It could have developed in several ways, and perhaps did so simultaneously such that the lines of development eventually converged. The processes involved are not as important as the structures required. The rise of significant gestures would produce, over</page><page sequence="106">Four Scenes 223 time, a sort of trust in the experiential weight of certain anticipated self-stimulations to select one impetus over another. Many variations in impetus selection might develop from this. Here are a few possibilities: * Learning, perhaps from "too quick" responses, that antici- pated self-stimulations that were initially associated with less experiential weight produce more highly desired results; thus the weight of these anticipations increased over time. This would invoke experiential differentiations between impeti in a cluster and also would encourage experiential differentiations between the moment of anticipated self-stimulation and the moment of the anticipated next state felt within a single impetus. * Learning to repeat an act when the next state produced by the response of the other organism is not what was antici- pated. Learning that repeating acts will encourage the other organism to try a different impetus from within the same complementary cluster. In this case the anticipated self- stimulation would be sort of subjectively insisted upon, via act repetition, and differentiated from other features of the impetus. * Learning that a grunt of disappointment encourages the other to try another act from within an impetus cluster when the acting organism has been disappointed. One can think of many other possibilities. In each case, however, communicative intentions emerge from the structures of significant gestures, from the unconscious assumption that a social typification is shared identically. From within this assumed identical typification, differentiations are learned between impeti in a single cluster. Differentiations are also learned between the moment of anticipated self-stimulation (of sensations correspond- ing to the complementary state) and the moment of anticipated next states (sensations produced by the actual response of the</page><page sequence="107">224 Essay Three other organism). The anticipated self-stimulation that an act will provide is employed more and more frequently in the selection processes that must handle competing action impeti. Communicative intentions evolve slowly, then, as an effect of experiential differentiations. Again, what become differentiated are the experiential sides of action impeti, with an emphasis on the anticipated self-stimulations that are associated with the complementary position. In place at all times is the assumption of a shared typification. As these processes advance, organisms begin to select acts with an implicit communicative logic. The other organism is "told," implicitly: "not that act, but this one." Significant symbols would depend on the assumption of a shared array of possible acts, that in turn depend on the assumption of a shared situation definition, such that one act can be indicated as opposed to others. Within the framework of my story, then, significant symbols depend already on an assumed shared structure of differences. It is this assumption of shared impetus arrays that makes it possible to indicate one impetus. The significant symbol advances over the significant gesture by assuming an identical meaning to a single gesture, rather than by assuming only an identical situation definition. But the assumption of an identical situation definition had to come first. The assumed identity of meaning associated with a significant symbol first arises in the form of an indication of one impetus in opposition to others, all of which are assumed to be shared within a typification. Norms Jürgen Habermas has reworked Mead's theory by claiming that three modes of "taking the attitude of the other" must evolve sequentially. Here is how Habermas theorizes the situation: With the first taking of the attitude of the other, participants learn to internalize a segment of the objective meaning structure to such an extent that the interpretations they connect with the same symbol are in agreement, in the sense that each of them implicitly or explicitly responds to it in the same way. With the second taking of the attitude of the other, they learn what it means to employ a gesture with</page><page sequence="108">Four Scenes 225 communicative intent and to enter into a reciprocal relationship between speaker and hearer. Now the participants can differentiate between the social object in the role of speaker or hearer and the other as an object of external influence, between communicative acts addressed to one's counterpart and consequence-oriented actions that bring something about. And this is in turn the presupposition for a third way of taking the attitude of the other, which is constitutive for participants ascribing to the same gesture an identical meaning rather than merely undertaking interpretations that are objectively in agreement. (1987b:14, italics in original) My revised story is in good agreement with Habermas's views. The first taking of the position of the other, in my version of the theory, is really the significant gesture: the moment when an identically shared social typification is assumed. Obviously, I do not think that identical responses are the mechanism for this first mode of position taking. But I am in agreement with Habermas that this first mode is essentially noncommunicative. The second way of taking the position of the other, according to Habermas, brings about communicative intentions without the norming of identical meanings. Once again we find a close match with my own story. The significant symbol arises, after the significant gesture is in place, as a way to specify one impetus in opposition to others. My story, however, adds an important feature: the dependence of significant symbols (which I define, again, as significant gestures with communicative intentions) on a structure of assumed shared differences. Habermas's third taking of the attitude of the other involves the norming of meanings. I do not find it obvious that this third mode of position taking would come after, rather than alongside, the second mode. Communicative intentions could have developed first through acts of repetition to mend a disappointed outcome, or through learning processes that begin with the selection of an experientially weaker impetus (by impulse, timing, accident) with the surprising result of a favorable outcome and then end with more experientially differentiated impeti such that selection becomes closer to rudimentary considerations of the other's position. Or communicative intentions could have begun with norming, as would be the case when an organism learns that a</page><page sequence="109">226 Essay Three snarl or grunt of disappointment will produce a second try on the part of the other. In this case the grunt of disappointment becomes a way of saying "no" to one impetus so as to indicate another. Very possibly all of these processes and others as well developed significant symbols during the same rough period of time. Habermas's point is, of course, essential to understanding the evolution of intersubjectivity. Norming had to enter the picture at some point. The significance of norming is that an identical meaning can only be communicatively indicated simultaneously with a norm: the other organism should understand one's gesture in a particular way, to indicate one impetus rather than others. Norming requires two previously established structures - the assumption of a shared social typification and the assumption of a shared structure of differences. The second structure is nothing more than the explication of one feature of the shared social typification; the existence of impetus clusters in which each composite impetus is the result of multiple somatic compressions. We are now ready to explore some of the basic structures of significant symbols, each of which depends on the nature of social typifications. Before discussing these basic structures, however, I wish to remind the reader of the caveats with which I began this revised theory of George Herbert Mead. The Problem of Asymmetrical Interactions: Communicative Intentions and the Self Central to the caveats about my revision of Mead's tale is the dependence of this story on a symmetrical interactive chain with roles that can be occupied by all participants. A symmetrical interactive chain rules out typical interactions between mothers and infants. It makes it difficult as well to explain how something close to significant symbols can develop between humans and other animals. My dog Ginger, for example, acts toward me very much as if she has communicative intentions and as if she regards me as a subject rather than an object. Ginger expects a walk every evening. When it is evening she often places herself near me and waits until I begin the first steps toward getting us both ready for a</page><page sequence="110">Four Scenes 227 walk. If I wait too long, Ginger starts to whine or even bark while she stares directly at me. She appears to be trying to remind me what time it is. Barking at me and whining at me while she stares at me are acts difficult to interpret without assuming that Ginger takes me to be a subject rather than an object. When I begin the usual preparatory steps for taking Ginger on a walk her activities seem to become even more communicative. I start putting on my shoes or a coat, and Ginger begins to dance about in excitement. As I then walk toward the place where her leash is kept she becomes even more animated and yelps excitedly. Once the leash is in my hand she often cries out and jumps up on me. Now, if I put on my shoes and then start toward the location of the leash but halt on the way, Ginger will do things that seem designed to persuade. She will bark and then wait for me to continue. If I do not, she will repeat the bark. Though these acts on Ginger's part could be explained without reference to any communicative intentions it is very difficult to drop this interpretation. She uses expressions of anger, as if I should continue toward the leash. She also uses repetition, as if she is trying to get me to perform "A" rather than "B." It is possible that communicative intentions and some distinc- tion between subject-to-object and subject-to-subject inter-actions could have evolved without self-stimulating sensations that have been learned from the complementary position in an interactive sequence. Certainly Ginger's behavior toward me during walk time appears communicative without any past experiences, on Ginger's part, of being in the complementary position. Ginger's various acts could not stimulate within herself the sensations of what it is like to be in my position. What, then, of the acquisition of a sense of self in Ginger? Mead's theory, as is well known, would posit a sense of self dependent on the self-stimulation of acts, in the way that meaningful acts arouse experiences associated with the comple- mentary position. A sense of self begins with the internalized response of others to one's own acts. Nothing in my movement toward the leash and Ginger's responses to it would give Ginger an experience of how I experience her. Does Ginger then lack a</page><page sequence="111">228 Essay Three sense of self? Well, if I praise Ginger she behaves as if she relishes my praise and feels, well, "good about herself." And if I scold Ginger she acts ashamed, as if she really feels bad about herself. She seems to want my positive regard and yet we cannot theorize her grasp of either a positive or a negative regard through the self- stimulation of gestures. We all know about anthropomorphism. To interpret Ginger's actions as displaying communicative intentions and to interpret her responses to praise and scolding in terms of her sense of a self probably is anthropomorphic in everyday life. But reflecting upon the situation in an effort to avoid anthropomorphism will not give us a certain counterinterpretation. I am certainly not willing to say that Ginger has no communicative intentions or any sense of self just because I cannot easily come up with a theory capable of explaining these things. If some of Hegel's insights were correct, then all creatures could possess a nascent sense of self that emerges most prominently through symbolically mediated position taking. Many Eastern models of the mind also insist on this. In one such model (Anandamurti 1968) the self is conceived of in terms of three stages: the "I have done" (or citta), the "I do" (or aham), and the "I am" (or mahat). This model links the self to action much as Mead's theory does. But only the stage of "I have done," or citta, would require full communicative position taking. The "I do" is a sense of self felt as one acts that disappears just afterward. The "I am" is both the totally implicit self that exists prior to maturing through developmental stages, and the totally real self, found in the experience of samadhi. If this model is at all in tune, Ginger might "feel her self" in prereflective ways; she might experience a nascent version of the "I-feeling." At any rate, one of the most appealing features of Mead's story is that it assumes the worst in order to deliver a desired result. It assumes that the mythical organisms discussed begin with no communicative intentions at all and no subject-object distinction in their experience and no nascent sense of self. My reworked version of Mead's story does the same thing, while being open to alternatives. The development of symbolic consciousness in the</page><page sequence="112">Four Scenes 229 growth of human infants into children is not well explained by these stories. Nor are a large variety of interactions between humans and other animals, such as dogs. These Meadian stories are not final or complete, but by "assuming the worst" these stories are very helpful in our quest to understand the basic structures of intersubjectivity. The Evolved Structures of Meaningful Acts Importance of the typification By the time the significant symbol arises, an umbrella structure, the social typification, exists as a precondition to the first mode of position taking. Position taking that evolves beyond this stage, as in the movement from significant gestures to significant symbols, occurs "within" this umbrella structure. The existence of this umbrella structure is itself claimed, and thereby instantiated, with each meaningful act that is dependent on it. Its existence is virtual, not actual. This theory of the typification, then, is completely consistent with Anthony Giddens' notion of structure: the medium and the outcome of action (1979). Thus typifications are constituents of meaningful acts, of action impeti in fact. This would explain why action impeti contain preunderstood audiences and, at least implicitly, both the second and third person perspectives on the act. The second person position is rooted in the anticipation of self-stimulation compressed to the impetus. The third person position is rooted in the assumption of a shared typification with its array of impeti. The third person position is a possible perspective, whereby both organisms could in principle objectify their assumptions of a shared situation definition in order to discuss the applicability of a norm or the array of acts that are available to each participant. Within the significant symbol in its full, normed form are the implicitly distinguishable categories of objectivity, subjectivity, and the normative realm. As Habermas has famously argued, differentiations between these realms will become necessary under adaptation pressures to communicate more precisely and to mend misunderstandings. The first significant symbols, via the typifications that constitute them, simultaneously imply objective,</page><page sequence="113">230 Essay Three subjective, and normative claims. Adaptation pressures will begin to specialize the symbol system so that an objective, normative, and subjective vocabulary evolves, as well as grammatical distinctions between first, second, and third person. While the symbol systems that evolve in relation to objectivity unfold within expectations characterized by shared access and perception, the symbol systems evolving in relation to subjectivity require mappings between a privileged realm and a shared realm via root symbols that are constituted in analogies and metaphors. In order to communicate an experience that is differentiated as one of the privileged variety, analogies to experiences of the shared variety are important. If I say "I have a deep longing for moral purity" I am referring to subjective experiences and states but use metaphors from the world of shared access. "Longing," "deep," and "purity" are metaphorically structured concepts when used in this way. Subjectivity, the world of privileged access, is frequently represented with analogies from the world of multiple access. Acting to Clarify Meanings Mead's theory offers an explanation of the fact, long noted by expressivists (Taylor 1979), that acts clarify their meanings as they are acted out. Meaningful acts are constituted by processes of compression that anticipate full experiences to be brought forth by the acts themselves. Thus we are able to phenomenologically examine action impeti to obtain a vague and uncertain sense of what they will fully mean to ourselves if we act them out. The I-Feeling Mode There are two ways in which the concept of the I-feeling mode might be incorporated within Mead's theory. The first way is the weakest. Mead's theory of the self is that it develops only after position taking has developed. The self then becomes an emergent structure, an internalized and generalized response to one's own act that is dependent on the typical ways that others respond to one. Most social acts will accordingly provide some sense of the self for the actor through the responses of others. Such responses</page><page sequence="114">Four Scenes 231 to one's acts will not only internalize so that a reflective concept of self becomes available, they will also compress to action impeti so that a vague feeling of self will feature in the impeti of meaningful acts. This is not a necessary conclusion from either Mead's theory or my revision of it, but it is certainly a possible conclusion if the theory of subjective compression that I have advocated is valid. The second way in which an I-feeling mode might be incorporated within a Meadian framework is stronger and cannot be derived from Mead's theory. I personally favor this interpre- tation and find it congruent with both Hegel's theory of self- consciousness (outlined a little later on) and Eastern theories like the one intimated earlier: the composition of self by various moments linked to action - the citta (I have done), the aham (I do), and the mahat (I am). In both of these theories a sense of self is believed to be nascent within all forms of consciousness. Not only is it nascent, it is infused with desire. It is nascent as the desire for recognition in Hegel's theory and as the desire to experience one's self as infinite in many Eastern philosophies. The desire to experience one's self as infinite and unlimited is actually a feature shared by Hegel and many Eastern philosophers. Mead's theory is not inconsistent with this second, stronger, theory of the I-feeling mode. Full incorporation of this idea within the Meadian framework would be achieved, however, only if the drive for recognition were to be demonstrated as a crucial motivation complex that emerges when certain developmental stages are reached. Such developmental stages would require, at minimum, the prior development of significant symbols. Mead's theory could be linked to a revised theory of praxis in this way. Recollection and Reflection as Evolutionary Products This dialogical theory of meaning and consciousness relegates the mental acts of recollection and reflection to the status of internalized interaction patterns. When one is able to recollect what has just passed in experience, and thus to reflect on one's experience, one is basically taking a second or third person perspective on what was initially a first person phenomena. The ability to take second and third person perspectives within an</page><page sequence="115">232 Essay Three umbrella of first person privileged access is an evolutionary product: the result of internalizing interaction patterns via the significant symbol. One understands one's own impeti to act only by "responding to one's self" from the position of another. But this means that one understands one's self only through application of analogies and metaphors. Juxtaposing the Phenomenological Sketch with Mead's Scene Three When we say that an act is "meaningful" we are referring to the possibility of understanding the act from diverse social positions structured by the three formal positions of first, second, and third person. Meaning has everything to do with position taking, with intersubjectivity. Scene three employs the presuppositions of realism to make possible explorations of the origin of intersubject- ivity. In this section I will review the conclusions at which we arrived in the discussion of scene three to emphasize their correlation with the phenomenology of meaningful acts. The ability to take first, second, and third person positions in relation to the same act is structured through a preunderstanding of subjectivity. That is to say, the differentiation between first and second or third person positions is dependent on an understand- ing that actors have privileged access to portions of every impetus to act and have shared access to portions of every act. Therefore, the meaning of an act, if it is mapped on to as explicit a semantic field as possible (i.e., if articulated through conventional com- munication structures like language), must make reference to Habermas's three formal ontological realms: a) the subjective realm, in which signs are used to reference portions of experience to which actors have privileged access b) the objective realm, in which signs are used to reference portions of experience to which actors share access c) the normative realm, in which signs are used to reference horizon structures that formerly were not part of explicit</page><page sequence="116">Four Scenes 233 experience but apperceived and assumed to be shared in all communicative processes. The horizon structures originate in the internalized social typification. The contrast between experiences characterized by privileged access and experiences characterized by shared access assigns the status of claim to all references made to each of the three realms (the subjective, objective, and normative realms). This is another point emphasized by Habermas. An actor implicitly makes a series of claims concerning her subjectivity, concerning entities and relations in the objective realm, and concerning normative rules governing comprehensible and appropriate modes of activity (the normative realm). The concept of claims here is ontologically grounded in the necessity of monitoring an action in order for it to be meaningful to one's self. Taking a second or third person position with respect to an act requires the placement of one's self in a position with respect to the act that renders portions of the impetus inaccessible. Another way of saying this is to say that one's subjective states are never a certain affair, even to one's self, for subjectivity itself is differentiated in experience only when one is able to take the imagined positions of others with respect to one's own acts. The references made by an act are therefore claims dependent on the possibility that others will recognize or acknowledge them. No perceived act of acknowledgment, however, will make a claim a matter of certainty. This is also due to the contrast between privileged access and shared access. When another affirms a claim there necessarily remains the possibility that the privileged access the other has with respect to her impression of the act does not correspond to the privileged access of the actor. Those who seem to affirm may not really affirm within their privileged realms, or, if they really affirm they may misunderstand and affirm for the wrong reasons. It is impossible to ever be certain with respect to claims. Explication of the subjective realm will frequently be a matter of applying analogies, similes, and metaphors to indicate I-feeling modes, feelings, intentions, and holistic understandings that are preobjective or nonobjective. From a scene three analysis we</page><page sequence="117">234 Essay Three arrive at something like Derrida's "trace," because signs have meaning in this scene by virtue of the fact that they transpose first, second, and third person positions alongside the fact that such transpositions must presuppose the distinction between privileged and shared access. An impetus to act is both the point of the act and a "trace," or "vanishing point," because of its dependence on the recognition of another, and because of the impossibility of ever achieving unambiguous recognition. Dependence on the recognition of another is explained with scene three, for scene three suggests that all signs (linguistic, imagery, even proprioceptive configurations) are evolutionary products - internalizations of expectations arising from social interaction. Thus: a) When a mental object "stands for" something else one can move between first, second, and third person positions with respect to it. b) Reflection and recollection involve the movement between first, second, and third person positions. c) This movement is plagued by uncertainty because of the distinction between privileged and shared access. d) Signs that stand for subjectivity and normative claims will generally do so as analogies because such signs basically consist of a mapping from the realm of privileged access to the realm of shared access. e) Such mapping is also a "flattening," because an implicit, holistic understanding must be explicated temporally and for the sake of others. Among all the claims carried by a meaningful act is the identity claim: the claim that the actor exists with certain (implicitly understood) subjective capacities and traits that may be judged according to normative standards. The identity claim thus works</page><page sequence="118">Four Scenes 235 with claims that bridge the subjective and normative realms. The identity claim too, can never be unambiguously affirmed. Hegel's insights come into the model at this point. The desire to be understood will be associated with the desire to be recognizable in all acts, though it may not play a thematized role in most meaningful acts. The desire to be recognized is related to being-as- desire which was explored from a different perspective in the section on scene two. A little more can be said about recollection and reflection as they appear within scene three. As stated above, they are associated with position taking. Scene one rendered pure recollection an impossibility and described it instead as a special form of repetition: a new meaningful act. The reason for its impossibility was given through an analysis of perception and problems associated with the concept of "now." With scene three, however, perception is simply one kind of action; internalized though it may be. It is a series of impeti oriented toward the explication of an object of experience for another; a project in articulation. Recollection in scene three appears as a form of representation, of taking the stance of another with respect to an experience. It is impossible in pure form not so much because of time and temporality but because of the distinction between privileged and shared access. Mead's Scene Three and Deconstruction The "trace" appears within Mead's version of scene three as the result of the distinction between privileged and shared access rather than as the result of temporality. Indeed, temporality appears in scene three only as a secondary effect of inter- subjectivity. So subjectivity is never known with certainty because objectifying it is like "presenting" it, and thus constitutes it against the distinction between privileged and shared access, even when this is done for "one's self." One's self is constructed by such internalized "presentations" and is not knowable as such. One's self, and particularly its moment within an impetus as an I-feeling mode, is always already past in time because of the distinction between shared and privileged access, the shift from a first to a</page><page sequence="119">236 Essay Three second person position. The shift from a first to a second person position is what constructs "first" and "second" person positions: privileged access exists primordially as such only when it has already gone by in time. However, "privileged access" is always a preunderstanding: when one contemplates the always already goneness of primordial first person experience one does so with the understanding that this act of contemplation occurs within the privileged access of the thinker. It is a preunderstanding that layers itself whenever one attempts to capture it. Thus one could argue that scenes one and three are simply different beginning places for posing the question of meaning. We could start with scene one to explain intersubjectivity as a secondary phenomena that is derived from primordial experiences of the privileged sort. But doing this deconstructs when one encounters the temporality problematic. On the other hand, we could start with scene three to explain experiences within the privileged realm (reflecting, perceiving) as derived from internalized interaction patterns and the significant symbol. But this deconstructs when one encounters the mutual dependence of first, second, and third person positions. The distinction between privileged access and shared access, carefully considered, is impossible to pin down because in fact there is no purely privileged access and there is no certain shared access. Hegel's Construction of a Scene Three Hegel's treatment of scene three has the disadvantage of being a complete fantasy. It is not grounded in a modern theory of evolution nor is it informed by the work of ethologists who have contributed greatly, since Hegel's time, to our knowledge of animal interactions. But Hegel's treatment of the scene, fantastic though it is, possesses insights into the nature of desire and the I- feeling that are absent in the work of Mead and Habermas. Dialectic of Passive Consciousness: From Certainty Toward Truth Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit (1967) is a preHusserl sort of phenomenology that works with presuppositions of a type</page><page sequence="120">Four Scenes 23 7 Husserl would have disallowed. The first part of the book, following the famous preface, consists of a "scene one" sort of discussion. It begins with a passive consciousness who feels certain of its knowledge of sense objects. This is called "sense certainty." Objects seem to be given directly to consciousness through the senses. There is a feeling of certainty that the objects are there, exist there, and the truth of this certainty appears to reside in the immediacy of sense experience. Hegel then produces a sort of deconstruction of this scene by playing off certainty against truth. The certainty of immediate knowledge permeates the experience of viewing an object, but all efforts to indicate the truth of this certainty fail. In fact, all such efforts lead us dialectically past sense-certainty into what Hegel calls "perception." But then perception also results in dialectical movement into what he calls "force." The gist of the whole dialectical argument is that the truth of sense certainty at first appears on the objective side of the situation. The object before us is self-evidently there; it supplies its own truth. By the time we get to "force," however, the truth of sense certainty is found to lie on the subjective side. This is because efforts to articulate the truth of sense certainty have led to an understanding of the object as an "activity" Hegel associated with "thought" - a set of negations that bring the object out in its particularity. A bowl has shape, color, size, and so forth, each of which can be understood only through a set of negations (circular is such by not being angular, blue is such through negations of other colors on the spectrum, all qualities have their identity through a structure of contrasts). When we understand that our perception of an object depends on an implicit set of negations we have grasped what Hegelian scholars call "first negation." First negations are related to the concept of "difference" in twentieth century structuralist theories of meaning. But Hegel argues that our efforts to get to the truth of the situation may go further and result in a grasp of "second negation": the object is the unified activity of negations that bring it about. Such activity, Hegel argues, is "thought." The object "is" thought in that its identity is the activity of negating what it is not. Second negation brings out</page><page sequence="121">238 Essay Three objectivity as a process of self-construction through negation: it is one insight into Hegel's famous formulation: "substance is subject." In the third stage of part one of the Phenomenology, the stage called "force," abstract entities like fields, forces, energy, and so on, are posited by consciousness to explain the truth of the object, and these are clearly features of "thought" for Hegel, because they are totally posited and in no way experienced with the illusion of immediacy. "Force" is analogous to twentieth century constructs like quarks, neutrinos, and mesons, which are not perceivable but are posited in order to explain perceivable phenomena. A better term than "force" might therefore be "model," as it is used in science. Scientific models are metaphors that originate in sense experience (the idea of a force abstracted from experiences of pushing and pulling, of an atom initially abstracted from exper- iences with small bounded objects, etc.). But once the abstraction has been applied we end up with a concept whose identity depends upon structures of difference (as in first negation) and whose existence is thought to be beyond objective appearances (as in second negation). The full second negation is grasped when we think of the forces and entities posited by science as generative activities. The first appearance of objectivity is structured by the difference between the self and the world that is not-self. By the end of this dialectic this difference structures the distinction between appearance and reality. Reality is not the object pole within experience, the object pole within experience is rather appearance, which implicates nonperceivable forces that, for Hegel, are aspects of thought or subjectivity. Thus, Hegel ends the first part of the Phenomenology by claiming that passive consciousness grasps the truth of its certainty of sense objects as itself. The truth of the object is the subject, in that the principle that originally distinguished the subjective side of sense certainty (negation as activity) turns out to be fundamental in the domain of the objective side. At the end of the stage "force," passive consciousness finds itself (subjectivity) to be the truth of all possible objectivity. Passive consciousness has found itself to be an infinite principle that</page><page sequence="122">Four Scenes 239 underlies all possible objective forms. And when this occurs it finds itself in disquiet, desire, and "life." Passive consciousness transmutes into active consciousness that begins its own process of dialectical development. Dialectic of Active Consciousness: Implicit Truth as Desire The second part of the Phenomenology of Spirit leads us to Hegel's scene three: the origins of intersubjectivity. This part begins with the "discovery" that the truth of sense certainty is subjectivity, a discovery that has moved us from a passive consciousness to an active one. Passive consciousness found itself to be the truth of sense certainty and objectivity generally. Passive consciousness found some form of identity between those core differentiations that characterize subjectivity in opposition to objectivity and the nature of objectivity when it is carefully explored. This is an abstract identity, however, suggested by thought, and is not experienced with the certainty that one initially feels in sense- certainty. The truth that objectivity is rooted in subjectivity, that substance is subject, is not certain. Now active consciousness will attempt to (1) become certain of this truth, and (2) consequently, become certain of what it, itself, is. Active consciousness does not begin, as passive consciousness did, with a feeling of certainty (in "sense certainty") but with a feeling of desire. Desire as a Play Between Implicit Truth and Certainty Hegel thus frames the concept of "desire" around the distinction between certainty and truth. To fully understand the beginning of the scene described in part two, the reader must understand a point repeatedly made by Hyppolite in his rigorous commentary on the Phenomenology of Spirit : each new major section of the Phenomenology begins as if consciousness has "forgotten" the previous stages and the results of their dialectical movement (Hyppolite 1974). So active consciousness does not begin with full conceptual thought. Active consciousness cannot recall discover- ing that the truth of sense certainty is itself. Rather, this "result" is</page><page sequence="123">240 Essay Three an implicit feature of desire. Active consciousness begins as desire, which is rather like an urge to make an implicitly known truth explicit. So the desire characteristic of reflective consciousness, of human consciousness, is ontologically rooted in an implicit truth and oriented toward an experience of certainty about this truth. Active consciousness begins as the desire to be certain of a preunder- standing it possesses with respect to itself: that it is the truth of all form and therefore that it is the unlimited possibility of all form. Consciousness as Nothingness Striving for Being Yet active consciousness begins in "life" and experiences itself as limited. It has a body, it is distinguished from other objects, it is a sort of object itself. It is a finite subject. But the finite subject is not limited in the way that an object is because a subject is aware of its limits and continually seeks to transgress them. That is the mode in which the identity of the subject first becomes present to itself: as desire to strive beyond limits, desire for certainty of its unlimited nature. The "being" of active consciousness is not a "being-in-itself" determined by delimitable form, but rather a "being-for-itself" determined by its efforts to feel certain of its unlimited nature. Effort and desire are its modes of being, not qualities attached externally to that being. At first active consciousness seeks certainty of this preunder- stood truth, that it is unlimited, infinite, through the way it experiences objects. The identity of the subject is not form but is first given through experience as the negation of form. The subject is the "not-this" within the experience of the "this." In Eastern philosophy the same idea is expressed as neti, neti : "[I am] not this, not that." In "pure life," says Hegel, "nothing as such does not exist ... but we are the nothingness" (Hegel quoted in Hyppolite 1974:155). One of Sartre's major philosophical texts is entitled with the same scene in mind: Being and Nothingness. Consciousness is "nothingness" that tends toward being (form), but that is plagued by the contradiction that it is beyond all form; that it is unlimited.</page><page sequence="124">Four Scenes 241 The experience of being "not this" comes through actively negating a "this," an external form, by eating it, or moving it, or otherwise exercising power over it. Objects are negated in developmentally early modes of desire. New objects appear within experience and they, too, are "consumed" or altered through some action undertaken by the subject. An endless process of desiring objects outside the self and negating them through acting upon them gives a repeated feeling of certainty that the truth of the subject is negation of form (and thus a bare feeling/touch upon the truth that the unlimited subject is the substance of all objects). This process of negating objects, however, does not satisfy for long. For Hegel, a slight feeling of certainty with respect to the truth of the self as unlimited is provided with every act of consumption (every act of object- negation) but active consciousness desires genuine, full, lasting certainty of its infinite nature. Endless consumption will not satisfy this desire. Thus the subject "tends toward the infinite, the unconditioned," but "this infinite is not an object; it is a task, the accomplishment of which is forever deferred" (Hyppolite 1974:145). In Hegelian language, desire is the form of the infinite seeking to overcome the limits of the subject, the limits of form. Continual consumption provides a vague and temporary feeling of certainty, a "promise" that the subject is unlimited, infinite, but one that defers full gratification with every act. To become fully certain of itself as unlimited, consciousness must raise the implicit truth in desire to an explicit truth. Hegel plays beautifully with the terms "certainty" and "truth" and provides us with important insights, in this way, as to the nature of desire. The Contradiction in Desire Now, "truth" for Hegel is conceptual truth, which amounts to having a "grasp" on something. To have a grasp on something is to be detached from it so as to recognize its boundaries, or "determinations." My certainty of the existence of this bowl in all its particularities requires the delineation and full representation</page><page sequence="125">242 Essay Three of its features to become a truth. My desire for certainty of the truth of myself amounts to a desire to take an implicit truth and make it explicit in a similar way. This will also require delineation and representation of features. But how could my unlimited, infinite nature be grasped in this way? How could I delimit what is unlimited? In the case of an active consciousness that becomes bored with continual consump- tion this problem appears in a specific way. If I try to grasp the truth of myself I must have myself before me. Having one's self before one is objectifying one's self in some way. But how is it possible to objectify one's self when one is unlimited, when one is that which always transgresses all limits? In Hegel's words, consciousness "never is what it is and always is what it is not" (see Hyppolite 1974:150). Hegel begins with an active consciousness that does not yet reflect and conceptualize. The active consciousness gains an implicit sense of itself through action. It feels itself as the "not" of all active experiences, as that which is beyond the objects of action. Consciousness is not a form to itself but a preconceptual I- feeling that is gained fleetingly through continuously negating forms in various ways. It is a feeling that by its nature escapes the boundaries necessary for it to become an explicit truth, an object of knowledge. Consciousness suspects but does not know its infinite nature. The Desire for Recognition This prereflective consciousness comes to seek certainty of itself through the eyes of another active consciousness. It cannot be an object for itself but perhaps it can be an object in the eyes of another. If this other is an unlimited subjectivity, and if it then recognizes the implicit truth of active consciousness as unlimited and infinite, then a full feeling of certainty may arise. Preconceptually, desire becomes desire for the recognition of another consciousness. The implicit truth that consciousness is unlimited and infinite constitutes a desire of infinite promise and anticipation: the desire for recognition. The way to explicate the</page><page sequence="126">Four Scenes 243 implicit truth seems to rest on the possibility of the totally affirming gaze of another. The next scene in Hegel's story is famous and is his version of our scene three. Two active consciousnesses engage in a life-and- death struggle with each other, each desiring the recognition of the other. Recognition can only be one-way in this setting: it amounts to one consciousness consenting to limit itself as an affirmation of the limitlessness of the other. It is a scene rather like that of two schoolchildren fighting. Each one will be satisfied if the other gives in by indicating in words or otherwise that the winner is "the best," that the winner is beyond the one defeated and is not limited by the loser. It does not matter to the children whether or not the other is "objectively beaten" (the limit case being the other's death). Rather, the point of the fight is to have the defeated agree or recognize that she or he is defeated, which is the ultimate way to affirm or recognize the victory of the other. Desire and Fear This is a life-and-death struggle in Hegel's scene because it is a scene of only two consciousnesses, both of whom pin everything on the outcome. "Pinning everything on the outcome" is to be taken in a very strong sense, because Hegel describes this struggle as the origin of self-consciousness. The fear involved is not simply a matter of "losing face," it is a matter of not existing at all, it is fear of the void. Losing is an affirmation of the absolute nothingness experienced in desire. Losing locates the implicit truth that consciousness is infinite solely in the victor. When the fight begins, each participant must cope with this total fear, this total uncertainty, this terror that one might be nothing. The loser bends to fear, chooses "life" (biological life), and acknowledges herself or himself as nothingness. The winner does not bend to fear, risks life absolutely, and thereby feels infinitely affirmed through the recognition of the other. Winning is an ultimate fear rendered baseless and impotent. Losing is an ultimate fear come true. The desire for recognition is intimately linked to a primordial form of fear.</page><page sequence="127">244 Essay Three Self Consciousness and Intersubjectivity With the completion of this struggle, self- consciousness has evolved. The victor is self-conscious by virtue of the affirmative gaze of the defeated. The defeated is only implicitly self- conscious, for it finds its truth in the victor and sees itself as nothing through the victor's eyes. Self-consciousness begins, then, with a social relationship: the relationship of the master to the slave. The social relationship is now internalized in two distinctive ways. The master struts about feeling infinitely affirmed, but only for a brief period. The slave begins to work for the master and internalizes the master's attitude toward herself or himself by disciplining herself or himself to perform work. Hegel goes on from here to show the dialectics inherent in the situation. The master requires the slave to perform work, but the recognition won by the master turns out to be a dead-end. The slave is no longer a full subject whose recognition could really "count," whose withdrawal of recognition is infinitely feared. Repeated affirmations from the slave do not satisfy the continuously arising desire for self-certainty. It is rather like the author of a bestseller who begins to suspect that people who "really matter" do not appreciate the book, that those who applaud the book's brilliance do not really understand it. The slave has become a sort of "object" in the master's eyes, and recognition can count only if it comes from another unlimited subject who symbolizes the possibility of being nothing as well as the possibility of being all. Since this sort of recognition turns out to be impossible after every single act to win it, fear of the void is not vanquished, only dulled, with each victory. The slave, meanwhile, internalizes its relationship to the master through work. While working, the truth of the slave's own nature is discovered through the internalization of the relationship: the slave's ability to take both positions, master and slave, within herself or himself. And this truth takes an objective form in the products of her or his work. The unlimited nature of conscious- ness is felt once again within the consciousness of the slave, each time her or his creativity and self-discipline produce another</page><page sequence="128">Four Scenes 245 product. Yet this too turns out to be unsatisfactory. Slave consciousness evolves into the stoical attitude in which nothing external is allowed to limit the nature of consciousness. Consciousness is unlimited thought, now possible because a social relationship has been internalized and because internal reflection between self and implicit other may take place. But this also turns out to be limited: the stoic finds it necessary to act toward an external world once again in a continuously negating way in order to experience the fleeting sense of being beyond all form. This time, however, "form" is the intellectual products of others, all of which carry some claim of unconditionality, of infinitely being-beyond with respect to the authors' identity. The stoic has become the skeptic, displaying her or his own limitlessness through the negation of others' claims to limitlessness. And so on: the dialectic keeps going, from stoicism to skepticism to unhappy consciousness ... eventually to "absolute knowledge." Insights Remember that it is the insights Hegel provides us, rather than his specific arguments, that must capture our interest. In this section I will specify nine insights from Hegel's Phenomenology that illuminate scene three in important ways. The idea that an ontologically fundamental desire constitutes conscious- ness. This fundamental desire is the desire to overcome limits as well as the desire to attain certain knowledge about the real nature of the self. In contrast to various desires that consciousness may have from time to time, this desire is part of what consciousness is. Less-fundamental desires that seem to come and to go, such as desires for food and for sex, appear rather like vehicles for this ever-present mode of desire within Hegel's dialectic of active consciousness. Most modern theories of evolution would consider the emergence of self-consciousness from consciousness to be merely the product of adaptation and survival needs. For Hegel, self-consciousness emerges as the product of a primordial desire for certain self-knowledge. Once self-consciousness has emerged</page><page sequence="129">246 Essay Three this fundamental desire is still unfulfilled; it remains to drive further developments in consciousness. The idea that desire may be related to the concept of "implicit truth." The desire for certainty that Hegel wrote about begins as a preunderstanding that seeks to make itself explicit and therefore certain. Self-consciousness is originally constituted by desire as the anticipation of a grand and fundamental self-validation. Consciousness is teleological, directed toward the realization of a truth about itself that it has always suspected to be true. The relationship between desire and the fear of being nothing. The fear of being nothing is a prominent feature of human motivation. The desire to become certain of one's self seems to be primordially linked to an existential fear of being groundless or of not being at all. Weaker versions of this fear include the dread of being worthless. The experience of a preunderstanding of one's true nature as a fleeting feeling of certainty: rather like the I-feeling mode discussed earlier in scene two. The preunderstanding of what Hegel regarded as the implicit truth of the self is a desire that receives partial satisfaction through continuous action. Prior to the internalization of social relation- ships, this satisfaction comes just after each act (of negation, in Hegel's scheme) but then quickly fades away into new desire. The orientation of desire toward another consciousness-, desire as desire for recognition. After social relationships are internalized so as to produce self- consciousness, the preunderstanding of the self develops into a preunderstanding of the stances others take toward one's self. Eventually this preunderstanding takes its various forms against generalized, internalized others, in accordance with Mead's views.</page><page sequence="130">Four Scenes 247 The origin of self-consciousness in social relationships that centrally involve power. Hegel gave central roles to power and domination at the very beginnings of self-consciousness. Many humans seem to pin their sense of having a valid identity on being powerful, and only through further development, should this occur, learn to maintain valid identities in equal social relationships. Historically, women have often been the dominated others for men and yet have developed and maintained identities within this structure of inequality. Though power may not be a necessary structure for the emergence of self-consciousness, it frequently does play a crucial role. Feminist theories, postcolonial theories, all theories that concern domination and oppression can benefit from Hegel's insights into the relationship between power, desire, and the self. The desire for recognition arises out of a problematic similar to those raised in our scenes one and two. Recognition is a sort of "recollection"; a second "seeing" of one's self which requires the "eyes" of another. It is one's own actions that one is able to gain a second seeing of through the eyes of another; one's actions (the "me") rather than the origin of these actions (the "I") and always just after these actions have taken place. Superimposed onto the question "who am I and how may I know it?," recollection appears as the contradiction of trying to represent what is not form (the "I") as a form (the "me"). Thus desire for recognition informs our understanding of recollection, and our analysis of recollection informs our understanding of the desire for recognition. The understanding that recollection, which appears as a sort of given subjective process or capacity in our previous two scenes, appears here as constituted by intersubjectivity, or position taking. This insight is of course totally in line with Mead's theory. Recollection is the metaphorical viewing of something that just occurred (an act or performance from a first person perspective)</page><page sequence="131">248 Essay Three from different perspectives that are socially given (second and third person positions). Recollection amounts to the effort to capture and fix the meaning of a performative act from the positions of others who observed the performance. Thus, recollection depends on experiences of having others respond to one's acts and performances. Recollection is motivated by a desire for an affirmative response to one's acts - "yes" as opposed to "no." And responses of others to any of one's acts may always have implications with respect to the self of the actor. The desired affirmative responses, moreover, are not going to permanently satisfy the desire for recognition. The Self and Presence Mead's handling of scene three misses many insights that one can find in the Hegelian fantasy. A particularly important contribution from Hegel is the desire for recognition. The desire for recognition, in turn, is rooted in a teleological view of the self; the self as desire to know itself for certain to be eternal, limitless being. This insight is missing from Mead, but it seems congruent with some of the discussion presented on scenes one and two, and it adds significantly to our understanding of recollection. It can be reformulated in nonHegelian terminology and in nonHegelian contexts. It is clearly related to what Derrida calls "the longing for presence" (1974). In Gayatri Spivak's discussion of Derrida's work, she says the self is constituted by its "never-fully-to-be- recognized-ness" (1974:xliv). The longing for presence is also a longing for recognition. Total recognition, however, is as impossible to experience as pure presence, and for the same ontological reasons. Impossible, that is, unless the Eastern theories discussed within the section on the feeling-body bear truth. If they do, pure presence and total recognition are indeed possible but only with the mutual collapse of world and self into a state that can never be represented for either communication or memory. In many Eastern philosophies it is said that one can never remember the state of enlightenment, only the moments just before and the moments just after.</page><page sequence="132">Four Scenes 249 Scene Three, the I-Feeling, and the Trace An I-feeling mode can be recollected as an experience that comes close to containing its own self-erasure. We need fewer conceptual steps to realize that the I-feeling mode is going-gone as soon as we reflect upon it than we need in the case of perceived "objects." In fact, it is the almost immediacy of the fading away of an I-feeling mode that seems to suggest the less immediately understood fading away of any object of experience; the "trace" as Derrida first introduced it in his deconstruction of Husserl. The I-feeling mode accompanies all perception because perception, in my view, is a set of acts, a group of impeti that are organized by a project. An object is first a preobject in experience that is only differentiated from the impetus within which it first appears through a special sort of internalized action: perception. The problem that time poses for "presence" is something felt, is a feature of experience, before it becomes a concept like the "trace" when impeti to act are the units of phenomenological study. Thus the I-feeling mode is prior to the trace. The claim I am making here is subtle and could be missed. As a concept, the I- feeling mode is just a different iteration of "trace" and must be regarded as the result of a framework of reflection that has been pushed to its self-destructing limits. As a concept alone, nothing more could be theoretically built upon the "I-feeling mode" than could be built upon the "trace." And Derrida's use of "trace" is purely deconstructive. But my claim is that within experience there is a sensation always present that is felt to be ungraspable, unrepresentable. The I- feeling-as-fading-away is experienced though not exactly per- ceived and thus not experienced in quite the same way that Husserl claimed to perceive retentions. To make this claim I must use a certain understanding of "presence." I must write as if this experience is somehow "the same" each time it occurs and I must write as if there were an intersubjectively recognizable identity between this experience as I repeatedly have it and this experience as you repeatedly have it. Yet the nature of this experience is that it slips away, that it is both always the same and yet always differently embodied in that there is always a different "mode" of</page><page sequence="133">250 Essay Three I-ness. So I am describing an experience that, though a "sensation," is also a type of understanding that this sensation cannot be represented in thought or language. One might question whether or not such a claim on my part is coherent, an issue that I will now address. Scene two, and portions of my discussion of Hegel, serve us by illuminating the possible coherence of this claim. Hegel's idea of an implicit understanding that tries to become certain of itself is completely congruent with my description of the I-feeling mode. An implicit understanding, argues Hegel, accompanies all acts of consumption (object negation) that partially and temporarily satisfy a desire for certainty about one's true nature. Desire is related to an implicit understanding, argues Hegel, that the self is unlimited. Because desire is a form of anticipation, it prefigures the nature of its gratification. The desire and the pre- understanding (the implicit truth) are conjoined within a single sensation. Hegel simply tells us that part of this anticipation involves the implicit understanding that the self is unlimited. He feels justified in asserting this because of his dialectic of passive consciousness, which supposedly leads from a feeling of certainty that sense objects exist as independent objects toward the conceptual understanding that subjectivity is the truth of all objectivity. This is the conclusion of the first book of The Phenomenology of Spirit. Hegel does not give us a full phenomenological treatment of the nature of desire as an implicit understanding that the self is unlimited. In my phenomenological investigation of proprioception (scene two), on the other hand, I found an I-feeling mode to be part of every impetus to act or think, and I found this I-feeling mode to be a form of desire. The gratification Hegel writes of is experienced on the level of sensation and feeling: an enhanced I-feeling that follows a successful act. In my analysis there is also an implicit understanding associated with an I-feeling mode. As the symbol pointing forward, the understanding is that the I-feeling will be enhanced through action. As the symbol pointing backward, however, the understanding is that the nature of the I-feeling</page><page sequence="134">Four Scenes 251 might be grasped through reflection. Associated with this is a new mode of the I-feeling itself, the mode correlated with the desire to reflect upon the I-feeling mode. This sort of self-reference brings about a movement in which the implicit understanding senses its certainty in the object already fading away (the I-feeling mode as that which just was: as intended object of reflection) and projects the gratification of the promise of implicit certainty ahead as the explification of the I-feeling mode (I-feeling modes are always embedded within action impeti). In Hegelian terminology, the subject is in possession of the implicit truth that the object is itself and seeks certainty of this implicit truth through an explication of it; through acquiring a rational grasp of it. In other words, the subject is seeking self- knowledge, seeking to explicate the truth that its object is itself. But this process encounters the problematic of presence, which is one reason why Hegel's dialectic leads next to the encounter with another consciousness. The desire to explicate the preunderstand- ing evolves into a desire for recognition. A MODEL OF MEANING In this essay I have described meaningful action through a phenomenological sketch and then considered the question of meaning against three originary scenes. We might now experience a temptation to bring things together and draw some conclusions. However, given the complexities of this subject, "bringing things together" is not a straightforward affair. The meaning of meaning has been an implicit understanding of mine as I wrote each section of this essay. Each major section, each scene, has been something like an explication of implicit understandings, which, plowed back into the soils of tacit understandings, has enriched what must remain implicit. Perhaps the more this state of affairs is accepted, by sort of "letting go" on a conceptual level, the more our forestructures will accumulate toward something like wisdom rather than philosophy. Perhaps all this effort to explicate implicit hunches and yearnings ought to be left in a movement rather like that described in scene two, but within the alternative register that writing and thinking employ.</page><page sequence="135">252 Essay Three Nevertheless, I regularly use some of the formulations that emerged from the various exercises that compose this essay. I have already formulated and published a model of meaning based on much of what is contained in the previous pages. I have described it, drawn diagrams of it, taught it to students, and used it in my own qualitative research. This model can be found explained and illustrated in my book on critical ethnography (Carspecken 1996). I find it highly effective for hermeneutic, reconstructive analyses of culture and in-depth self-exploratory interviews. I do not regard it as finished. I am sure I will continue to fill in its various regions and alter it in other ways as my work continues. But we know that even a more complete version of the model would be necessarily limited, for it was composed with the understanding that formulations of meaning amount to acts directed toward vanishing points. The model can be used to undermine itself, if one wishes to do so, and that is something I rather like about it. It can also be used in an unlimited number of creative ways: each use will be different, will be a guided work of creativity. Each use can change and enrich the guiding model. I like that about it too. Since the model itself has been explained in another publication, I choose a weak ending to this particular essay. I will not present the full model here. I will not try to synthesize all that has been said in earlier sections in order to produce a neat and tidied ending. All that I will do is outline the essential components of the model. Here are the components: An Expressivist Model of Action A meaningful act can be viewed as the explication of an implicit, holistic meaning. The act manifests an impetus into a temporal</page><page sequence="136">Four Scenes 253 sequence of behaviors. The meaning of the act is dependent on its embodiment in the act itself. A meaningful act interprets and clarifies its point. The implicit and holistic moment is a form of desire that points toward its own expression as a promise or anticipation. For an act to be meaningful, the desire entering into its constitution must be inclusive of the clarification of the point, either directly (as in acts oriented toward reaching an understanding) or indirectly (as in acts oriented toward producing certain responses from others, who must understand the act in order to do what is desired). The articulated, embodied, moment clarifies the implicit meaning constituting the impetus but only through the process of "monitoring" - the process by which an actor takes second and third person perspectives on her act, during and just after the act's manifestation. By "act" I mean to include thought. Thought is the "internal evolution" of impeti through internalized forms of expressive action and monitoring. All monitoring, however, results in an impression of meaning that is also holistic and implicit. Understanding the act of another also occurs through acquiring such impressions. An impression of meaning is a set of impeti to act again, and this may be accomplished in three modes corresponding to first, second, and third person positions. Thus a meaningful act involves complex part-whole relation- ships that are related to its constitution through monitoring and, in many cases, its premonitored nature. Meaning is constituted through taking first, second, and third person positions with respect to an act. Meaning is intersubjectively constituted. This initial frame within which to sketch my model of meaning is similar to the expressivist theory of human existence that Charles Taylor traces to the philosophy of Herder (Taylor 1979). However, the frame introduced here adds the concept of monitoring and includes the experience of receiving an impres-</page><page sequence="137">254 Essay Three sion of meaning. The first person position emphasized in expres- sivism is here conjoined to second and third person positions. The transposition of positions within the constitution of a meaningful act will be considered next. Moment-Totality Relations along Horizontal and Vertical Dimensions We can analyze the meaning horizon of an act along two dimensions. Let us use a spatial metaphor to call these dimensions the horizontal and the vertical. Horizontally, meaningful acts are constituted within the holistic, implicit, impetus through tacit assumptions and claims about the subjective state of the actor, about the nature of the objective world shared between actors, and about standards for judging the well-formedness of the act (what is comprehensible, what is "proper") and its moral and ethical implications (what is good, bad, right, wrong). This is basically Habermas's theory of communicative action conjoined with an expressivist model. The researcher must reconstruct these tacit claims to approach an articulation of the meaning of an act. But such reconstructions will always be partial. Horizon disclosure cannot totally exhaust the implicit and holistic impetus that constitutes both the act and the impressions produced by the act in those addressed by it or otherwise experiencing it. As Habermas says: [The horizon] contains parareflectìve certainties of a holistic nature which can't be exhausted by a finite specification of conditions. (Habermas 1987a:195). Vertically, all such reconstructed claims can be layered from claims most immediate to the meaning of an act to those most remote. Again, Habermas is helpful for understanding this aspect of the horizon or forestructure of an act: Inasmuch as communicative agents reciprocally raise validity claims with their speech acts, they are relying on the potential of assailable grounds. Hence, a moment of unconditionality is built into factual processes of mutual understanding - the validity laid claim to is</page><page sequence="138">Four Scenes 255 distinguished from the social currency of a de facto established practice and yet serves it as the foundation of an existing consensus. The validity claimed for propositions and norms transcends spaces and times, "blots out" space and time; but the claim is always raised here and now, in specific contexts, and is either accepted or rejected with factual consequences for action. (Habermas 1987a:322-323) The reconstruction of a horizon, when inferring meaning from social action, must note levels of unconditionality. Immediate claims within any of the three horizontal categories will depend on less immediate claims which will in turn implicate more remote claims. Often, the more remote a claim is within a meaning horizon, the stronger is its particular claim to unconditional status. This is because remote claims are usually least noticed and most assumed. But the moment of unconditionality applies to all claims within a meaning horizon. More of this is discussed and illustrated in the last essay within this collection: "Five Third Person Positions." A meaning horizon is therefore rather like an entire world that is tacitly claimed into existence with every meaningful act. The qualitative researcher can reconstruct the presuppositions of such worlds, beginning with those most particular to the act and then moving outwards toward what is most universal and unconditional. The further outward one goes, the more data one requires to substantiate the reconstruction. Use of the Text Metaphor Relations between the reconstructed claims of a meaning horizon may be examined. The world claimed by every act structures its various elements in diverse ways. Sets of structured semantic and pragmatic terms are implicated in every meaningful act. Relations of homology and binary opposition are often found (e.g.: masculine is to feminine as street knowledge is to school knowledge), as well as relations of logical inclusion and implica- tion (e.g.: unreasonable requests need not be obeyed, asking one to take a test when it is too hard is unreasonable, tests can be ranked from "hard" to "easy"). For examples of the use of the text</page><page sequence="139">256 Essay Three metaphor, see Carspecken and Apple 1992, Carspecken and Cordeiro 1995, Carspecken 1996. The Idea of Embodied Meaning Qualitative researchers can gain much by describing the gestures and postures accompanying an act in order to gain more immediate insights on the nature of the impetus. This sort of analysis has been well exemplified in Schooling as a Ritual Perform- ance by Peter McLaren (1993). This model of meaning allows perceptions of the body position of another to help the researcher reconstruct portions of the horizon constituting an act. Body posture and gesture not only indicate subjective states, however, they also reveal much of the normative and identity references involved. The Desire for Recognition Lastly, the concept of the horizon takes on added depth when viewed next to our analysis of scenes two and three together. All meaningful acts will have an existential, ontological dimension to them. Sometimes this dimension, which occupies the identity claim most immediately, is foregrounded and sometimes it is not. However, the qualitative researcher needs to understand that it is always there. People claim their valid being across the abyss of scene one with every act. Meaningful acts express something like the "will to power" and the "will to knowledge" (see my essay "Power, Truth, and Method" in this collection). Tacit levels of awareness supply a level of ontological suspicion that one may in fact be nothing and this suspicion is layered over by secondary suspicions that one may be limitable, objectifiable, and thus less than one desires to be. Meaningful acts are expressed against such ontological suspicions, at varying levels of risk depending upon purposes and contexts. When reconstructing a horizon in terms of its normative and objective world claims, the qualitative researcher must be attuned to the fact that actors ultimately stake their existence on their activity. Challenges to the validity of a claim about the world or a claim about what is right and what is wrong could be experienced</page><page sequence="140">Four Scenes 257 as challenges to one's ontological security. The full implications of the connection between horizon structures and existential claims has been exploited in another publication that may be consulted as an illustration of this point (Carspecken 1992). SUMMARY These, then, are components of a model of meaning, congruent with my phenomenological analysis of meaningful acts followed by the discussion of three originary scenes. Meaningful acts can be reconstructed by employing the horizon model with its horizontal and vertical dimensions and by paying attention to the identity claim that accompanies every meaningful act. Moments and components of meaning constituting acts can be analyzed via the text metaphor to reveal structural relations typical of a culture or a personality. The model as described above is a set of images from which many specific strategies for inferring meaning may be derived. I have only provided the barest of frameworks in this essay and I have discussed many things in this essay that have not been explicitly addressed by the model. The various discussions conducted within this essay should make it clear that this model is not meant to be a definitive statement on the nature of meaning. Rather, the impossibility of making any such definitive statement is part of the meaning of this model. The model is self-consciously a grand act of recollection, an assertion of the will-to-knowledge. It is intended to be at once useful and deconstructable. I promised to provide a very weak ending to this essay and now I have done so. The various discussions conducted within the various sections of this paper are meant to be intrinsically interesting explorations of meaning. They were not conducted mainly for the purpose of ending in a model of meaning useful for qualitative researchers. The sketch of a model I have presented at the end is nevertheless consistent with major themes that emerged and it was formulated with the previous explorations in mind.</page></plain_text>
