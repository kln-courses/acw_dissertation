[Originally published as Weisse Affen am roten Meer: Das soziale Leben der Wus- tenpaviane, by R Piper GmbH &amp; Co, Munich, 1992.] 1995. There are, it is said, three great achievements in science: breakthrough discoveries, bold new inter- pretations of data, and the effective communica- tion of the first two to the community-at-large. In this book, Hans Kummer, having already achieved the first two in his long career, tackles the third and succeeds. The book is both the professional autobiography of a renowned primatologist and a lucid and engag- ing explanation of the society of the Hamadryas ba- boon, on which most of Kummer's work has fo- cused. Kummer begins by telling us how he entered the field of primatology in the 1950s, during the premodern era of that discipline, and how he came to work on the Hamadryas and travel to Ethiopia to do so. He then describes how he assembled succes- sive teams of researchers to tackle problems relat- ing to Hamadryas social behavior, mating patterns, ecology, and social cognition. The most enlight- ening part of the book is the detailed behind-the- scenes depiction of how some of his most important studies were conceived and implemented. The ear- liest systematic studies of mate choice in monkeys were done by Kummer and his students, plus the famous studies of the behavior of translocated Ha- madryas in anubis baboon troops and vice versa. These will be fascinating to both the primatologist who was raised on these early studies and also the more general reader. Other chapters in the book deal with the work- ings of the Hamadryas' multitiered group fission- fusion social system and the ability of the Hama- dryas to cope with the exigencies of its arid and hostile natural habitat. I wish Kummer would not apply the term "marriage" to Hamadryas male- female bonds; it seems anthropomorphic and anachronistic. But perhaps it reflects Kummer's greatest professional strength-the ability to get in- side the social intricacies of the animals to a degree no one in the 1960s would have thought possible. All the while, Kummer is unravelling the individual stories of the baboons, and this is perhaps the core of the book-the feeling he gives us of the personal- ity of each Hamadryas and how it contributes to the overall pattern of group behavior. He reminds us that deciphering primate lives hinges on the cumu- lative details of quite idiosyncratic life histories.
