Wallace, Virtues and Vices (Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1978) RONALD DE SOUSA UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO "The way to discover what it is for a given kind of creature to live well is to study that creature and the life that it leads" ([4]: 32). This maxim, inspired by Aristotle and by the practice of biology, sums up the spirit ofJames D. Wallace's investigation into Virtues and Vices.' The approach it expresses is defended in the first chapter, "Goodness and Life". The second chapter ("Excellences and Merit") sets out a technical apparatus intended to clarify the relations between actions, tendencies and capacities (viewed as species of a genus of "action- states"), agent merit, excellences, skills, and virtues. This apparatus is then used to develop analyses of some typical virtues of the three fundamental kinds which it is Wallace's chief originality to distinguish: "restraint", "conscientious- ness", and "benevolence". "Honesty, fairness, truthfulness, and being a person of one's word" (p. 90) are characteristic forms of conscientiousness. They are "commitments to forms of behavior rather than concerns for the happiness, security and comfort of other people" (ibid.) and thus correspond to the traditional categories of duty and obligation. They are argued to be both indispensable to the conduct of human life and irreducible to other categories of virtue. Their domain is what Wallace calls "Hobbes situations", where self-interested agents acting with strict rationality are liable to do worse for themselves than they would if all had taken a risk on the cooperation of others. The virtues of benevolence include "kindness, generosity, humaneness, and compassion" (p. 128). These are typically virtues of supererogation. One of the most interesting discussions of the book arises out of the question why, if these virtues are so useful, they are not obligatory (p. 150). Both conscientious- ness and benevolence are motivational virtues: that is to say those that have them are motivated to behave against immediate self-interest either by respect for a practice or institution, or by concern for the welfare of others. By contrast, the virtues of self-restraint are not motivational. On the contrary, "from the standpoint of the motivational view of character traits" they are "privative" (p. 77). That is, they consist in the capacity not to be motivated by the threat of pain or by the inducements of easy pleasure. They are thus most easily characterized through analyses of their contrary vices, cowardice and self-indulgence. Such are the bare bones of che book's argument. On the way the author finds occasion to discuss a number of traditional issues, such as the problem of acquis,ition of virtue, the relation of duty and inclination to moral worth, the relation of practical reason to virtue, the debate between act- and rule- utilitarianisrn. As with any good book, there are more interesting points than a 161</page><page sequence="2">162 NOOS brief discussion can hope to cover. In what follows I take up a sampling of salient issues. BIOLOGY AND EVALUATION Wallace's naturalism is no simplistic evolutionism, nor does it have anything in common with sociobiological attempts to infer ethical conclusions from facts-or presumed facts-about adaptation. He does not claim that ethics is a branch of biology: the concepts invoked in the justification of the virtues are the traditional ones of utility and benefit, not those of fitness, reproductive strategies, or adaptation. But what biology is asked to provide is encourage- ment: it teaches an "epistemological lesson", namely that "general theses about the impossibility of objective studies of normative matters must be abandoned" (p. 25). This has the ring of a meta-ethical manifesto against non-naturalism. But what exactly is its force? Wallace is not merely drawing our attention to the relevance of objective studies to normative conclusions: even a hard line non- naturalist would have no quarrel with him there. He means, rather, that biology exemplifies a science in which normative facts are among the explananda which can be inferred from "objective" facts. Is this something that a non-naturalist would deny? The answer is not clear. To see the problem, consider George C. Williams' account of the basis of reproductive success and "the resulting adaptations": "A gene is selected on one basis only, its average effectiveness in producing individuals able to maximize the gene's representation in future generations" (p. 24). Wallace comments as follows: "I point here to the normative nature of what is thereby explained-the fact of adaptation" (ibid). But, a non-naturalist might object, what is normative about the fact of adaptation? The term is ambiguous: in Williams' sense, it refers merely to a certain degree of reproductive success of a genotype in a given environment. Natural selection explains all degrees of success indifferently-including the most common, degree zero, extinction. The element of evaluation therefore lies not in the "fact of adaptation", but in the connotations of the concept, including the assumption that high reproduc- tive success is a good thingfor a gene. This again a non-naturalist could take in stride, with the observation that 'reproductive success is a good thing for a gene' is either a tautology implicitly defining 'good-thing-for-a-gene', or else it is a manifestation of harmless but quite extra-scientific anthropomorphism. By 'adaptation', however, Wallace-at least in some passages-means something stronger. He endorses Aristotle's program of discovering the di- verse goods "of a tree, a sea-urchin, a coyote" (p. 29). And he speaks of the "flourishing" of "normal individuals" in "favourable circumstances" (p. 20) which is to be determined by application of "a vast network of concepts, classifications, theory, and lore" (p. 23). Now in so far as this notion of flourish- ing is not reducible to the maximizing of a gene's future representation, it is not strictly speaking explained by the facts of natural selection. This does not show, of course, that Wallace is wrong in claiming that objective studies of normative matters are possible. It does show that the considerations he adduces about adaptation do not establish his contention for biology, in any sense strong enough to ruffle a non-naturalist. In yet another way adaptation is a tricky concept, which may cause more trouble than Wallace allows for his project of applying a biological (or Aristote- lian) method of inquiry to human well-being. No organism is adapted tout court.</page><page sequence="3">WALLACE'S VIRTUE &amp; VICES 163 Adaptation is (at least) a two term relation between an organism and an ecological niche. So even if it is relatively easy (for one suitably armed with concepts, classifications, theory, and lore) to articulate what would constitute better or worse adaptation to a given environment, the question becomes much harder if we don't assume a constant niche. A first degree of difficulty is added by the attempt to evaluate adaptation in the light of possible changes in environment. Take the versatility conferred on primates by their larger brains. Does this make them 'better adapted' because they can deal with changes as they come? So we've been taught. But look at the beetles: they have stood a much longer test of time. Wasn't it a superior trick of adaptation to pick a niche in which for millions of years there would be no need for change? "Better for the cockroaches that they never evolved into something else! (For they wouldn't be around if they had.)" Is this an objective statement about the good of cockroaches? A much harder difficulty is reached when the niche might be changed by the organism itself. For then the whole ecological system comes up for evaluation at once: what best niche for the organism, and what best organism for the best niche? The difficulty arises with a vengeance when we try to apply the naturalistic strategy to ethics. Wallace concedes that there is a "striking disanalogy between our conception of a plant's or a beast's flourishing and a human being's living well" (p. 33). For him this consists in the conventional aspect of human life. But this is only the most salient of the way that humans can change their situation. This power to change the conditions of human life gives rise to one of the perennial questions of ethics: how much universality can we demand of an account of human good? Wallace's account aims at extreme generality. In his view nothing is worthy of the name of virtue unless it is justifiable in terms of the social character of human life at its most general: "in order for a trait to be a virtue, it must tend to foster good human life in extensive and fundamental ways" (p. 153). This ensures that the argument remains above the melee of contentions about whether certain virtues should be done away with at the same time as the conditions to which they are appropriate. But I miss, in a book such as this, a discussion of how real virtues are related to what more or less ephemerally passes for virtue. What are we to think of those traits that were regared as virtues by people who reasonably, though wrongly, expected that the conditions under which they made sense and were useful were part of the unchangeable human condition? Such are chastity, perhaps, or fealty, or other virtues associated with the social status of a class or a gender. Wallace's account is in the substantive tradition of ethics: it is no mere description of the criteria actually in use for labelling virtues. So one feels one has a right to expect some wisdom on the subject of disputed virtues: what are we to think of ambition, say, or detachment, or "theological" virtues such as hope? RATIONALITY AND MOTIVATION "Hobbes situations" (commonly known as "prisoners' dilemma situations") are generally treated as posing a problem for the theory of rationality. Following David Gauthier, Wallace expands the scope of the problem to morality and motivation.2 This can be made clear in terms of three principles: (1) Morality (virtues) must be useful to human life. (2) A moral act must be a rational act.</page><page sequence="4">164 NOUS (3) An act is rational only if its balance of expected utility to the agent is positive or at worst zero. Many philosophers (Wallace cites Plato, Hobbes, and Foot) have wanted to hold all three (99). But Hobbes situations are incompatible with their conjunction. To give up (2) is unacceptable to one who takes a naturalistic approach to Ethics; without (2) it would be messy indeed to insist on (1). Wallace chooses to give up (3). The price is not, after all, very high, for one need only abandon the assumption that no motivation is reasonable except self-interest. A course of action can be rationally chosen as desirable to oneself without being desirable for one's own interest or benefit alone. The desire to participate in a beneficial practice requiring adherence to certain rules would be one such motivation. (Another is benevolence.) What then of the act-utilitarian's counter-argument, that automatic adherence to a practice is itself an undesirable practice, yielding less total utility than acts everywhere based on particular calculations? Wallace's answer is that act-utilitarian principles are in fact incompatible with the sorts of expectations that such practices as promise-keeping set up and require (102-3). Hence no act-utilitarian version of the practice could subsist. Practices presuppose and constitute a community. And a community does require things of its members-otherwise it would not be a community. If all is well, then often these requirements will be reasonable. (p. 115). This will not satisfy the hard liner who insists that rationality is no longer intelligible if (3) is given up. But it effectively localizes the disagreement and perhaps even shifts the burden of proof. Besides, for his purposes Wallace needn't answer the hard liner. For his claim is not about the nature of ration- ality, but about why certain traits or "action-states" should be regarded as virtues. And for this it is adequate to show that in the light of Hobbes situations, a motivation to conscientiousness, capable of overcoming self-interest, pro- vides general benefits unavailable without it. ARE VIRTUOUS ACTS ALWAYS GOOD? Some action-states are skills. But skills are not virtues, for two reasons. First, virtues do not, like skills, involve the mastery of a technique (p. 46); hence virtues cannot be, like skills, forgotten. (Yet kindness involves tact (p. 144): is not this in part a psychological skill?) More important, "some skills are not worth having" (p. 43), whereas "if an action is fully characteristic of a virtue, then the action will be in that respect good because that is what a virtue is" (ibid). This seems wrong. For on Wallace's own account there is a whole category of virtues-self-restraint-that are needed "to be able successfully to followany life plan, including a bad one" (p. 87). Does a Nazi who despite the self- indulgent temptations of friendship denounces a friend perform an action that is "in that respect good"? The value of self-restraint as Wallace explicates it is instrumental, not intrinsic. Therefore that an action is fully characteristic of such a virtue should not be sufficient to make it good in any respect. It merely increases an agent's chance of doing good if he has good aims. If this is right, then not every virtue automatically makes an agent good. Wallace has blunted what for Aristotle-his patron philosopher in this inquiry-was the most telling distinction between skills and virtues: that skills</page><page sequence="5">WALLACE'S VIRTUE &amp; VICES 165 but not virtues could be used in the service of bad ends. (Cf. Nicomachean Ethics 1 140b22-4). The relation of ends and means raises another question: often it demands ajudgment on the part of the agent. Must this judgment be right? Or is it only its subjective nature that matters? Wallace is content with observing that the criteria may conflict: if the agent conquers a great fear for a footling or imaginary danger, "one might say... that doing Y is bravefor the agent, but it would not be correct to say unqualifiedly that his doing Y is courageous." (p. 71). But what is the standard for appropriateness? It is here that the model of biology gets invoked most explicitly: "the norm... can be explicated in terms of our conception of normal human activity", which in turn "must be understdod in terms of a way of life" (pp. 69-70). - The danger I see here is that the implications are necessarily conservative. For a "normal" way of life must balance competing values and goals; but it is typical of those who affect our conception of what life could be-saints, heroes, revolutionaries-that their passion for a partial goal is excessive. While conced- ing that excess of generosity, for example, is not a vice, Wallace says nothing about the possibility that virtues may conflict. This is especially likely to arise on a motivational view of virtue. And-as Lester Hunt has observed, one can expect "a characterological corollary, . . . that men who are remarkably just are not likely to be especially generous, and vice versa."3 Wallace gives us no clue as to what, on his view, the criteria of-assessment should be in such cases. This has returned us to a problem raised above. In terms of the biological analogy, too much of the discussion takes place as if we were taking for granted stable conditions of human life, and too little attention is paid to that char- acteristic human activity which is concerned with changing the conditions in terms of which "adaptation" is defined. These are ideological quibbles. Virtues and Vices is a good book. It contains some sustained and careful analysis, and is very readably written. It also embodies an unobtrusive but welcome contribution to the struggle against the sexism of our literary conventions, by referring at least sometimes to Agent X of the examples in the feminine.
