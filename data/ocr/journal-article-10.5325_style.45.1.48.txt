<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Maria Stefanescu University of Alba Iulia Revisiting the Implied Author Yet Again:  Why (Still) Bother?1    Long-lived and hotly debated, arguments over the proper scope of the notion  of an “implied author” —  Wayne C. Booth’s 1961 critical concept — have become  “inextricably bound up with the epistemological and normative controversies about  the place of the author in textual interpretation” (Kindt &amp; Müller 2). A further  debate has been prompted by conflicting views on the actual relevance of the  concept for specific narratological analyses, especially following the development  of a rhetorical line of inquiry into narrative construction and purpose. In this  essay I shall attempt to bring together two prominent directions in recent ethical  criticism — what R. Eaglestone has called the post-structuralist, Levinas-oriented  and the rhetorical-and-narratological “wings” (“One and the Same” 602) of the  contemporary ethical reflection on fiction — and determine whether their respective  understanding of the idea of an implied author can indeed further their particular  research aims as well as clarifying current confusion about the notion. By exploring  some of the unacknowledged implications of the discourse on the implied author,  I seek to intervene in debates about Booth’s concept and make the argument that  it remains fraught with ‘technical’ difficulties (exactly how is one to ascertain the  semantic and/or ethical positioning of this authorial presence?) and proves, in the  end, indefensible. After reviewing discussions of Booth’s concept, I compare two  readings of Yann Martel’s Life of Pi in order to explore the relevance of the notion  of an implied author for the cases when one wishes to arbitrate between contrasting  interpretations of the same text. I then go on to argue that neither the rhetorical and  narratological nor the Levinas-oriented ethical criticism has succeeded in rendering  Booth’s concept a precise and effective tool for literary interpretation. I conclude  my analysis by considering the possibility that an alternative understanding of  intentionality will enable practitioners of both lines of inquiry to pursue their  research without needing to resort to the concept of an implied author. 48 Style: Volume 45, No. 1, Spring 2011 </page> <page sequence="2"> Revisiting the Implied Author Yet Again: Why (Still) Bother? 49 The Reader and His/Her Other While generally inclined to distance themselves from the variety of ethical criticism  illustrated by neo-Aristotelian scholars such as Martha Nussbaum and Wayne C.  Booth, proponents of a deconstruction and/or Levinas-inspired approach to the  ethics of literature engage the legitimacy and relevance (or lack thereof) of the  concept of an “implied author” mostly obliquely, by way of a larger critique of  the neo-humanist project. If the post-structuralist investment in reading ethically is  necessarily linked to a commitment to the “unreadability” of all texts, understood  as their perpetual opening onto subsequent interpretations (Hillis Miller 41), then  seeking to identify an implied author (indeed, the implied author2) of a literary work  can surely only appear as a dubious endeavor to reduce the multiplicity of a text’s  meanings to the totalizing unity of authorial intention. Likewise, when confronted  with the ethical imperative of recognizing and responding to the Other, which  represents the well-known foundation of E. Levinas’s philosophical project, any  effort to reconstruct an implied author’s presence ‘behind’ the literary work seems  bound to fall under the suspicion (or actual indictment) of reducing the alterity of  the text to the sameness of the interpreter’s (un)conscious self-projection. In its more powerful articulation, the former critique points to the likelihood of  an effective, though unacknowledged, replacement of the ‘implied’ authorial figure  by the real author, who thus becomes the ultimate repository of a work’s ethical  and aesthetic commitments. One of R. Eaglestone’s key arguments in the case he  makes against M. Nussbaum’s ethical criticism is that, despite theoretical claims  to the contrary, Nussbaum relies heavily “on the presence of the author as a guide  to interpretation” (Ethical Criticism 50). Voicing a similar concern, A. Z. Newton  ascribes the limitations of Wayne Booth’s ethical project to its being structured in  terms of a commerce between writers and readers, with the latter remaining “busy  imagining ethical relations with authors” (64) in the (thin) disguise of “stand-ins  like ‘implied author’ or ‘extradiegetic narratee’” (64). Although it is possible that no  amount of evidence based on “applied” criticism will be deemed sufficient to appease  such qualms, I would like to invoke the argument from example: the literary criticism  produced over the years by critics like Booth, Rabinowitz and Phelan can hardly  be charged with having been single- or narrow-mindedly devoted to discerning the  interpretation intended by any given flesh-and-blood writer. Besides, in the wake of  the contemporary post-structuralist, post-Barthian, post-deconstructive theoretical  reflection, it seems highly unlikely that any critical endeavor (ethical or otherwise)  would be open to charges of committing the “intentional fallacy.” If anything, the  voice of the real author has been routinely dismissed, to the point that one wonders  </page> <page sequence="3"> 50 Maria Stefanescu whether it may not be time to give it a fair (relaxed and guilt-free) hearing, not as  the final word on the one putatively ‘truthful’ interpretation but as one voice in the  chorus that surrounds the literary work and may possibly complicate the reader’s  engagement with the otherness of the text. It is with reference to this otherness of the literary work that, I believe, a  post-structuralist Levinas-inspired ethical consideration of (the interpretation  of) literature can emphasize some potential pitfalls incumbent on operating with  the concept of an implied author. Rather than being vulnerable to a nostalgia for  ‘the writer’s intent’, the contemporary reader might be prone to a deliberate or  unconscious self-projection, an urge to “interpret the work according to her own  values — and then name this self-reflection the implied author’s intention” (Hale  199).3 Both Cora Diamond and Jane Adamson have warned against the prospect  of reducing a literary work’s alterity to the sameness of the moral philosopher’s  neat and tidy categorizations — which may well be only a particular case of the  potential narcissism of all interpretation. If such be the case, and if a literary text  “will not lie still to be investigated” (Diamond 56) from a distance by detached,  self-contained, self-projecting readers, could the latter begin to open up to a  genuine encounter with the literary Other when deliberately rendering themselves  vulnerable to “loss of the world as one previously knew it” (Adamson 91, original  italics), loss of self-confident appropriative understanding? Indeed they could,  argues Dorothy J. Hale, who draws on the insights of post-structuralist ethicists  like Hillis Miller, G. Harpham, L. Huffer, and J. Butler to make the case — partly  in reply to her own earlier critique of the concept of an implied author — that  the likelihood of the readers’ creating implied agents that mirror themselves is  counterbalanced by their deliberate assent to an effacement of the self during the  process of reading. Whenever they respond “positively to the text’s hailing,” the  readers’ tendency towards subjective projection can be limited by their voluntary  effort at “self-binding” (Hale 199). Moreover, argues Hale, the encounter with the  implied author — thus liberated from deluded subjectivism — can be construed as  precisely the encounter with the otherness of the text in the form of beliefs which  “whether those [of] the implied author’s or a persuasive character’s . . . may last  as long as the reading experience itself or may, in its most powerful instances,  permanently alter the beliefs the reader holds when she closes her book and begins  paying her bills” (199). Dorothy J. Hale’s explicit conceptualization of the implied author as him/ herself4 the figure of otherness in the literary text may remain somehow isolated  in the field of post-structuralist, Levinas-influenced reflection on literature, but it  </page> <page sequence="4"> Revisiting the Implied Author Yet Again: Why (Still) Bother? 51 does closely approximate one of its core underlying assumptions. When articulating  his critique against W. Booth’s rhetorical project, a Levinasian and deconstructive  critic like Andrew Gibson argues the case for what he regards as an alternative  “ethics of alterity” (27) whose liberating power is to be derived from rejecting  “totalities” of any kind in the name of recognition and celebration of “radical  difference, heterogeneity, the thought of the incommensurable” (11). However,  for anyone prepared to hear more than uncontaminated neo-Aristotelian overtones,  Booth’s own description in The Company We Keep of the reader’s (ideal) encounter  with literature sounds distinctly Levinasian. Rather than “taking my pleasure  with a work” (Company 135), Barthes-like, Booth argues that I, the reader, am to  surrender to the text, to succumb to the thoughts of another, to allow my(-)self to  be “occupied in the sense of being taken over, colonized: occupied by a foreign  imaginary world” (139).5 Whenever this fails to happen, “we can hardly say that  we have responded to — that is, behaved responsibly toward — the implied author”  (141, emphasis added). This position seems equally to prove overhasty Levinasian  scholars’ critique of Booth on the grounds that the latter’s “continuing attention to  fictional rhetoric — now weighted by an ethics — shows how dedicated he is to a  mostly unidirectional and static model of literary discourse: from author through  text to reader” (Newton 65). What a consistently Levinas-oriented ethical criticism will probably feel  compelled to reject is, I would expect, rather Booth’s second move, away from  the otherness of the implied author and back to the (variously impacted) self. The  often cited preference Levinas expressed for the experience of Abraham over that  of Ulysses, for the “movement of the Same toward the Other that never returns to  the Same” (Humanism 26, italics original) appears radically to contradict Booth’s  notion of “an ethics that entails both surrender and refusal” (Company 136). If, as  the latter argues, “I serve myself best, as a reader, when I both honor an author’s  offering for what it is, in its full “otherness” from me, and take an active critical  stance against what seem to me its errors or excesses” (136), does not the eventual  return to the reading “I” render the whole ethical enterprise abortive, hypocritical or  at best self-deluded? Possibly so, should the ‘homecoming’ be construed as a return  to the Same, to the totalizing Ego which “recovers itself through all that happens  to it” (Levinas, Totality 36) and defends its closed autonomy while voraciously  assimilating otherness to sameness. However this “hyperbole of separation”  (Ricoeur 337) and denial of alterity, which is Levinas’s account of the isolated (or  homecoming) subject in Totality and Infinity, need not be the paradigmatic narrative  of all returns. Indeed, on an alternative understanding of identity (P. Ricoeur’s in  </page> <page sequence="5"> 52 Maria Stefanescu Oneself as Another), which regards sameness (idem-identity) and selfhood (ipse- identity) as different rather than overlapping, with the latter becoming positively  inflected as the seat of constancy that makes possible the response “Here I am”  (165), the return to the self no longer implies the recovery of “some unchanging  core of the personality” (2). Instead, this very return opens up the possibility of  a dialogue which can initiate a relation bridging “the absolute distance between  the separate I and the teaching [summoning, accusative] Other” (339). Whereas  each successful reading experience will have the I of the reader “broken into”  by the Other of the text, the return to the (no-longer-the-same) self6 need not be  accompanied by dissolution/appropriation of difference — ideally, a dialogue will  ensue which, whether founded in harmony or tension,7 avoids the a priori silencing  of either participant.     A Narratological Conundrum  The specific forms taken by the purported dialogue between the reader and the  implied author have prompted considerable narratological controversy, which the  hypothesis of the implied author as the figure of textual alterity does, as such, little  to dispel. As “Booth himself . . . neither specified the theoretical framework in which  the implied author was to be used nor provided a methodology for identifying it in  individual cases” (Kindt &amp; Müller 9), subsequent debates over the concept have  resulted in a number of conflicting definitions: pragmatic (the implied author as a  participant in the narrative transaction), syntactic (the implied author as a structural  aspect of the text), as well as semantic.8 While the first two categories have largely  been abandoned as untenable, thick conceptual mist still appears to surround the  semantic understanding of this authorial presence: are there various ‘implied  authors’ validly inferred/constructed (by different readers, at one or different times  in their lives) for each literary work, or are these approximations of an invariant  they all seek to approach? The question may, in fact, more accurately be posed  when divided in two, with distinct reference to the production and the reception of  the literary text. Initially, the issue of whether an empirical writer projects one or  more implied authors is not addressed explicitly, although Wayne Booth seems to  envisage a unitary authorial “second self” for each work (Rhetoric 70-71). More  recently, Susan Lanser and Brian Richardson have each argued for the possibility  that a given text may in fact have more than one implied author, either in rather  exceptional cases (Richardson 120) or fairly regularly (Lanser 159-60), who thus  rehashes the challenge against the notions of coherence and unity associated with  the traditional concept of authorship). While seemingly endorsing an analogous  view, J. Phelan significantly shifts the argument to the effect that “there is no a priori  </page> <page sequence="6"> Revisiting the Implied Author Yet Again: Why (Still) Bother? 53 reason to assume that a given implied author will be consistent in his or her attitudes,  norms and beliefs” (Living 47 emphasis added). Lanser’s and Richardson’s claims  notwithstanding, the prevalent theoretical position appears to be in support of a  one-to-one relationship between the flesh-and-blood writer and the implied author. Not so that regarding the readers’ sense of an authorial presence in the literary  text. Not only have narratologists acknowledged one’s liberty to pursue multiple  non-authorial interpretations but even given the commitment to an “authorial reading”  (Rabinowitz 29), it has been recognized that different readers may/will infer various  implied authors from the same literary work. J Phelan ascribes the phenomenon  to the concrete circumstances of reading: while attempting to enter the authorial  audience, flesh-and-blood readers will carry with them their (various) beliefs, values  and cultural backgrounds, which may significantly impact their responses to the text  (Living 59). More radically, Booth’s 2005 defense of the concept of an implied author  engages in an extensive description of the different implied authors which readers  are likely to infer from a given text. Changeable according to various moments in  time (“Of course the IA I recreate by reading the text now is not identical with the  IA I would have recreated 40 or 20 years ago” [“Resurrection” 86]), the implied  authors as inferred from a literary work appear equally to depend on the reader’s  manner of approaching the text. It is the “sympathetic reading” of “fully hooked  readers” who “merge [themselves] with the created self who has created the work”  (86) that Booth seems to trust as best able to secure a successful “recreation” of the  implied author’s intentions. However, in a subsequent interpretive move “when we  start thinking . . . about different time frames and cultural contrasts . . . we create  versions of IA that the author would never have dreamt of as he or she created the  text” (86). Further complicating any attempt to reconcile and/or negotiate between  these different putative authorial presences, Booth argues as early as 1961 that  “[i]t is frustrating to try to deal critically with such effects, because they can in no  way be demonstrated to the reader who has not experienced them” (Rhetoric 213).  Booth’s description of an empathic authorial reading, which leaves “abstract  critical questions to one side until the [work] has been fully experienced”  (“Resurrection” 86) and actively avoids “imposing overstanding” on literary texts,  ties in well with J. Phelan’s remarks on the potential lack of congruence between  the actual experience of (rhetorical/authorial) reading and “standard academic  interpretation,” with the latter’s “underlying desire for mastery” (Narrative 180)  possibly translating into interpretive appropriations of texts. However, neither critic  regards the hypothesis of an implied author as incompatible with a plurality of  readings and interpretations. On the contrary, the conclusion of Booth’s renewed  </page> <page sequence="7"> 54 Maria Stefanescu reflection on the concept appears to make room for a plethora of implied authors  associated with any given literary text. During subsequent reading experiences,  various readers infer different but equally valid implied authors from the same  work; moreover, the many paths of critical interpretation are likely to generate  (also validly) still more authorial figures. If this is so, however, and if one cannot  hope conclusively to “demonstrate” to another reader the validity of his/her sense  of the implied author of any specific text, what exactly remains of the usefulness  of the concept for the actual practice of reading/interpretation? Indeed, even when applying themselves with perfect goodwill to the task,  how are readers to gather an understanding of the implied author associated with a  literary text? Whether they conceive of the implied author as an anthropomorphic  entity outside the text (Booth, “Resurrection” 80-82, Phelan, Living 45) or as a  textual function (Chatman, Coming 76, Rimmon-Kenan, 87), the narratologists  who find any use for the concept at all agree to locate its ‘trace’ within the literary  work itself. There is, however, considerably less agreement on whether this authorial  presence is to be regarded as implied by the empirical writer and inferred by  readers on the basis of textual evidence (Booth, Rhetoric 70-71) or as effectively  constructed by the latter during the reading process (Nünning 91, Yacobi 110). A  related difficulty appears to follow from the contention that, given the assumption  of an implied author’s design that is legible in a literary text, such evidence “can be  appealed to in order to adjudicate between different hypotheses about that design”  (Phelan, Living 48-49). Whereas I, too, believe that it should be possible to arbitrate  between interpretive hypotheses based on the amount and quality of textual evidence  supporting each, I fail to see any unambiguous ‘method’ for identifying some of  these interpretations as authorial readings. Of course, a given critic can profess  to be pursuing a rhetorical approach which aims to uncover an implied author’s  values and meanings. However, the eventual emergence of “a carefully constructed  model for the analysis of the implied author” (40, emphasis added), which W. Nelles  has optimistically envisaged, seems to me improbable. By definition, the only  evidence of any implied author’s intent is textual data — selection of which need  not, and often will not, coincide across different readings; also ex hypothesi, the  implied author is denied a voice of his/her own9 ever to resort to for ‘corroboration  of evidence’. Therefore, what seems more likely to be involved in any process of  “coduction” (Booth, Company 72) is a debate over, and possible assessment of,  interpretive hypotheses derived from textual evidence. For some of these, readers  and/or critics may wish to claim the label “authorial readings.” Since, however, it  has not been (and probably cannot be) determined how much, and exactly which,  </page> <page sequence="8"> Revisiting the Implied Author Yet Again: Why (Still) Bother? 55 textual evidence is to count as indicative of the implied author’s intentions (as  contrasted to that supporting other valid readings, which supposedly do not pursue  an authorial line of interpretation), this claim appears to rest on unclear grounds. An Imaginary “Coduction” on Yann Martel’s Life of Pi Booth’s 1988 coinage aims at describing the effort to understand and evaluate  a literary work, which every reader undertakes on his/her own, as well as the  subsequent process of comparing one’s “coduction” with, and testing its validity  against, other interpretations. Whereas Rebecca Duncan’s essay on Life of Pi as  Postmodern Survivor Narrative engages in a brief, mildly polemical, dialogue with  Werner Wolf’s earlier reading of Martel’s novel as a “post-postmodernist attempt  at eliciting (poetic) faith” (108), the two pieces have been produced and published  independently. I have, however, brought them together for an imaginary coduction  in the hope of illustrating some of the theoretical points made above (I would like to  add that neither Wolf nor Duncan claims allegiance to a Levinas-inspired or rhetorical  ethical criticism and may not necessarily endorse any of the statements made in this  article). Readers of the two essays find themselves confronted with vastly different  interpretations of Martel’s novel, and, in the earlier stages of my reflection on the  concept of an implied author, I thought I could build up an argument to the effect  that Wolf’s understanding closely approached an authorial reading of Life of Pi.  Now, however, while still prepared to argue that Wolf’s is the far stronger reading,  I have come to doubt that one can produce compelling evidence to identify it (or  any other one) as an approximation of the implied author’s meanings and values. Although he expands at length on the array of postmodern elements in Martel’s  novel, Wolf is led to believe these are mere points of departure for a text which  “testifies to rather different norms” and celebrates “a profoundly un-postmodern  and seemingly ‘unfashionable’ centre of meaning: religious belief as a ‘better  option’ in comparison to scepticism and atheism” (108). Pursuing a close reading  of the novel, Wolf traces the stages during which what might have become another  postmodernist story of migration, multicultural hybridity and decentering of identity  and meaning actually unfolds as “a spiritual rite of passage” (110). After professing  faith in Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam as religions that variously reveal the  loving kindness of God, Pi undergoes his experience as a Pacific castaway, which  forces “the same problem of the theodicy onto him which had once beset his  teacher of biology during a severe illness” (112). Unlike the latter, Wolf argues, Pi  — although having now fully experienced anger, desolation, despair and a sense of  abandonment — does, to the end, “cling to his faith” (112) and (in the protagonist’s  own words, cited by Wolf) “would go on loving” and trusting God. After exploring  </page> <page sequence="9"> 56 Maria Stefanescu the psychological, religious and aesthetic implications of the novel’s “better story,”  Wolf concludes with the argument that Life of Pi represents a return to storytelling  and to “investigating the human” thus fulfilling, specifically, a key Iserian function  of literature: “to highlight and explore the deficits left by dominant worldviews and  discourses” (119). Against the background of a highly secularized and rationalist  Western world, Wolf contends, Martel employs postmodernist self-reflexivity to  build a counter-discourse committed to the belief that “both poetic and religious  faith . . . is still possible and can persuasively be linked to ethics” (120). Rebecca Duncan’s contrasting reading of Life of Pi seeks to defend the  argument that Martel’s novel is “foremost an experimental survivor narrative that  participates in the emerging discourse on trauma and postmodern culture” (168).  To this effect, Duncan emphasizes the process of articulation and development  of what she regards as Pi’s postmodern self: prior to, as well as in the wake of  his traumatic experience, Pi resists the modernist “illusion of unity” (172), and,  rather than striving to restore coherence and wholeness to his identity and story, he  relishes his (purportedly reinforced throughout the novel) sense of a decentered,  multiple and fragmented self. In the light of this overarching hypothesis, Duncan  foregrounds the survival (meta)narrative which, plural and open-ended, is interpreted  as mirroring and testifying to the protagonist’s ever-fluid constructions of identity.  Concomitantly, the novel’s thematization of religious faith is either downplayed  (“the story of the ship’s sinking . . . features very little religious or spiritual insight”  [177]) or construed as further evidence of a postmodern self-definition (“True to  his postmodern subjectivity . . ., Pi narrates the evolution of his multiple religious  faiths in a self-consciously layered form” [175]) or misrepresented (according  to Duncan, who plainly disregards textual evidence, subsequent to Pi’s ordeal  “despair conquers hope and faith” and the protagonist’s religious thoughts “turn  to mockery and negation” [177]). In the conclusion of her article, Duncan, relying  on “an audience more open to the complexity of the postmodern self,” resolves that  “we might pass over the claim that this story ‘will make you believe in God’ and  challenge readers to contemplate whether or not they believe in Richard Parker”  (182). It comes as an exquisite irony, which appears to have been lost on Rebecca  Duncan, that Wolf’s article, published four years prior to her own, already inscribes  in its “points of departure” section the image of a “contemporary postmodernist  cultural critic” (107) whose pre-conditioned response to the novel is likely to  involve references to religious hybridity as “testifying to the relativity and ultimate  fictionality of religious and other ‘master-narratives’” and to the core post-colonial  tenet that “migration, cultural hybridity and transculturalism  equal the decentering  </page> <page sequence="10"> Revisiting the Implied Author Yet Again: Why (Still) Bother? 57 of identity and meaning, including religious meaning” (107). As these are central  elements in Duncan’s interpretation of Life of Pi, I would expect that, in terms of  the reader roles that the novel itself dramatizes, Duncan would belong in the ranks  of those who (like the two Japanese investigators, though based on very different  theoretical allegiances) “want a story that . . . will confirm what [they] already  know. That won’t make [them] see higher or further or differently” (Martel 302).   In support of Wolf’s interpretation of the novel as contrasting the secular and  religious worldviews I would like to adduce a further narratological argument:  I see the complex multi-layered narrative structure of Life of Pi as a cue for the  readers on how appropriately to respond to the story. Of the two divergent lines  of interpretation that are inscribed in the text, one is dismissed as oversimplifying  (the Japanese investigators’ distrust of Pi’s reliability dramatizes, and warns  against, the flesh-and-blood readers’ potential rejection of the book on grounds  of invraisemblance), while the other (the fictional “author” openly endorsing the  protagonist’s understanding of the significance of his story) is given prominence.  On more than one occasion, the “author” (who introduced the framing story and  the protagonist, having then himself become one of Pi’s narratees in the embedded  story) shares thoughts with an unspecified audience. I shall quote extensively from  chapter 21 what I regard as one such “corroboration” of Pi’s worldview:  I take pen and paper and write: “Words of divine consciousness . . .; a quickening of the moral sense, which strikes one  as more important than an intellectual understanding of things; an alignment of the uni- verse along moral lines, not intellectual ones, a realization that the founding principle of  existence is what we call love, which works itself out sometimes not clearly, not cleanly,  not immediately, nonetheless ineluctably.” I pause. What of God’s silence? I think it over. I add: “An intellect confounded yet a trusting sense of presence and of ultimate purpose.”  (63)  It would be difficult for me to read such passages as anything but invitations to  reflection on age-old questions (if at present “terribly old-fashioned,” as Pi’s mother  tells her son who asks permission for a baptism and a prayer rug) on the human  condition and the meaning/purpose of life. I would find it equally difficult not to  regard Duncan’s reading of Martel’s novel — given the amount of textual evidence  she understates or appears to overlook — as an illustration of a self-fulfilling  interpretive hypothesis. On the other hand, I believe that Wolf has grounded his  argumentation in rich and compelling textual data, producing a reading of Life of Pi  that accounts for a great deal of formal and thematic detail. Incidentally, as readers  of Martel’s interviews will be aware, Wolf’s interpretation happens to be congruous  </page> <page sequence="11"> 58 Maria Stefanescu with that of the flesh-and-blood author 10.  The one claim which seems to me to have  remained unsubstantiated is that “a clear stance taken by the implied author” (Wolf  113 emphasis added) indicates his partiality for the religious worldview. Indeed, it  might be asked, how could Wolf substantiate it otherwise than by amassing textual  evidence that appears strongly to warrant an interpretation along these lines?  Reasonable as the question and its rhetorically implicit answer are, they might still  circumvent rather than address one significant theoretical issue: on the assumption  that a literary text will elicit an indeterminate number of readings, some possibly  dismissed as weak or manipulative while others regarded as valid, how is one to  determine which ones in the latter category qualify as having inferred the implied  author’s stance? The Implied Author — An Expendable Fiction? The impasse, I believe, originates in a contradiction located at the very heart of  the notion and role of an implied author. If one is prepared to argue, following  W. Nelles, that “[t]he implied author has consciously created and invented every  implication, subtlety, ambiguity, and complexity that can be discovered in the text”  (26 emphasis added), it then seems to be the case that any interpretation whatsoever,  as long as it focuses on some “implication, subtlety, ambiguity, or complexity” of  the literary work will have inferred, at least partially, the implied author’s norms  and values (which would, of course, ultimately discount the possibility of any  “misreading” at all). This is not, however, the manner in which the functioning of  the concept has generally been understood. Rabinowitz (29-30), Phelan (Narrative  176) and Booth (“Resurrection” 86) have agreed that not all readings are authorial,  the first two critics specifically mentioning that some perfectly valid ones are not.  Moreover, it turns out there are readers who attempt, but eventually fail, to produce  an authorial interpretation (see Rabinowitz’s definition of a “misreading” [174]).  Finally, both Phelan (Living 58-59) and Rabinowitz argue that there are cases when  a literary work “does not provide enough internal evidence for the actual reader to  determine correctly the nature of the authorial audience” (Rabinowitz 42) and thus  successfully to join it in inferring the implied author’s position. One would expect,  therefore, that some clearly specified narratological tools have been made accessible  to differentiate between these various kinds of readings and unambiguously to single  out the authorial ones, but none seem available.11 As in 1961 (when Booth first  coined the concept), so today: critics can only invoke an “intuitive apprehension  of a completed artistic whole” (Rhetoric 73, emphasis added) when pressed to  substantiate their claim that they have successfully produced an authorial reading.  Competing interpretations can be defended in terms of their explanatory power and  </page> <page sequence="12"> Revisiting the Implied Author Yet Again: Why (Still) Bother? 59 critical insights; the ultimate argument for designating one’s own as an “authorial  reading” appears to be, however, one’s subjective belief that ‘this is what the implied  author must have meant when designing a particular literary piece’. Such being the case, discussions about the concept of an implied author, and  subsequent authorial readings, become eventually entrapped in argumentation about  whether any particular reading has been implied and correctly inferred, or actually  constructed by the reader and then ascribed ((il)legitimately?) to an authorial figure.  While much theoretical weight has been attached to settling the issue, I am inclined  to believe it ultimately remains unresolvable: if both implication-cum-inference and  construction are based on textual evidence, and if both invoke textual data to support  a particular interpretation, it becomes especially difficult to determine whether that  interpretation has been inferred or constructed.12 If so, whatever the critics’ claims  possibly accompanying a given piece of literary interpretation, any purported  authorial reading will be rendered vulnerable to the charge that it has merely sought  to legitimize a particular critical position.13 In the absence of some methodology for  identifying the implied author’s stance, and therefore the corresponding authorial  reading, such a charge may well remain indeterminable. For similar reasons, the  suggestion put forth by scholars working within the Levinasian and deconstructive  tradition that the implied author be construed as a figure of textual alterity does not  seem to me defensible either. Since successful recognition of the implied author  as the Other of the text remains as difficult to ascertain in interpretive practice as  successful understanding of any other of its ‘impersonations’, I fail to see how  the construal of the implied author as the seat of textual alterity can diminish the  current confusion surrounding the concept.  Protean, most elusive and resistant to clarification, the notion of an implied  author has nevertheless proven highly resilient. The explanation may lie in the  readers’/critics’ psychological need to associate the construction and significance  of a literary text with an agent’s deliberate intention to communicate, or at least  produce, some discernable patterns of meaning. Indeed, words such as “design”  and “intent” persistently appear not only in the discourse of scholars who have  all along defended an anthropomorphic understanding of the concept (e.g. Phelan  Living 48) but also in the work of narratologists (e.g. Chatman Coming 74) who  prefer to define the implied author as a textual function. The long-standing critic  of the concept, A. Nünning, has recently allowed himself to be persuaded of its  usefulness on the grounds that (with particular reference to unreliable narration)  a radically constructivist and cognitive approach would be rendered nonsensical  in the absence of an authorial intent it could unveil: “[t]he interpretive move to  </page> <page sequence="13"> 60 Maria Stefanescu read textual inconsistencies as a sign of unreliability after all does not make much  hermeneutic sense if it does not proceed from the assumption that someone designed  the inconsistency as a signal of unreliability” (Nünning 99, citing Phelan, “Lining”  48). While the reason for the preference expressed lately for an anthropomorphic14  understanding of the concept of an implied author may be rooted in a psychological  urge to postulate a human-like agent as the co-participant in any act of literary  interpretation, it probably also owes much to the more recent developments of  rhetorical-narratological criticism. J. Phelan has emphasized the equal importance  of all the participants in a narrative event, the implied author being regarded as the  necessary mastermind behind a literary work’s rhetorical effects (Experiencing 4);  along the same lines, Harry E. Shaw has argued that it is of the essence of rhetorical  reading that it should aim for “a critical reconstruction of the mind behind the  rhetorical purposes informing a work of narrative” (301). That the propensity towards ascription of intentions need not be regarded as  a scandal or an exceptional occurrence but rather as the norm of inter-personal  communication has persuasively been argued by David Herman. Based on the  assumption that human beings have an evolved predisposition “to adopt as a basic  and general heuristic strategy . . . ‘the intentional stance’ ”(236), Herman calls  for a renewed exploration of the role of intentionality in narrative understanding  and a consequent re-assessment of the anti-intentionalist stance of much narrative  research. Regarding the notion of an implied author as the byproduct of the New  Critical then (post)structuralist rejection of intentionalism, Herman argues that, once  contemporary narratology comes to terms with “the embeddedness of narratives in  intentional systems” (243), Booth’s attempt to compartimentalize15 intentionality  will become redundant. While probably the default heuristic strategy, adopting  the intentional stance need not be construed as searching for the intention of  some purported authorial figure behind the literary work. Instead, Herman argues,  intentionality in narrative contexts would more accurately be conceived of as “built  into the doing, the activity structure, of storytelling and story-interpretation” and  therefore regarded as distributed across “text producers, text interpreters, textual  designs, and the communicative environments in which such designs are produced  and interpreted” (256). On a model of narrative understanding “that acknowledges the extent to which  the process of interpretation hinges on making defeasible (= possibly wrong)  inferences about communicative intentions” without, however, characterizing these  intentions as “(wholly) immaterial mental states” (Herman 244), the reader can  hypothesize an interpretation as intended while refraining from too confidently  </page> <page sequence="14"> Revisiting the Implied Author Yet Again: Why (Still) Bother? 61 attributing it to an authorial figure. In the particular terms of Nünning’s example  (referred to above), the reader does assume that an inconsistency has been designed  as a sign of unreliability while at the same time being aware that his/her assumption  may be incorrect (i.e. perhaps an inference has been made where no clue had been  intended) and that ascribing it to the implied author does not confer it, ipso facto,  any additional force. Since they encounter a text ‘always already’ severed from  the empirical writer, readers are left to their own interpretive devices, (con)textual  knowledge, and “defeasible” conjectures when hypothesizing an interpretation that,  while based on assumptions about communicative intentions, cannot but remain  self-consciously tentative. I do not believe, on the other hand, that abandoning the concept of an implied  author impedes the larger project of either the rhetorical and narratological or  the post-structuralist Levinas-oriented branches of ethical criticism. As I have  attempted to illustrate by briefly comparing Wolf’s and Duncan’s readings of Life  of Pi, one does not need to resort to the notion of an implied author to arbitrate  between interpretive hypotheses. Nor is one prevented from pursuing ethical  goals — however varied, given the different convictions about what it means to  read ethically and/or inquire into the ethics of literature espoused by contemporary  practitioners of ethical criticism — in the absence of one authorial figure postulated  ‘behind’ the literary text’s ethical positioning. Indeed, as recent developments amply  demonstrate, ethical criticism of both persuasions can clearly illuminate each other’s  engagement with a more comprehensive concept of interpretation. Implicit in the  Levinas-inspired approaches to literature is the notion that, given full (if, one may  add, rather unidirectional) recognition of alterity, “the problem of fixing the exact  source of the relevant intentional states” (Herman 256, emphasis added) may remain  forever unresolvable and, indeed, need not overly concern the critic. Alternately,  the rhetorical and narratological practice of ethical criticism (as illustrated over  the years by Booth, Rabinowitz, and Phelan) has indicated that not all returns  to the reading self result in denial of alterity but are, at the same time, probably  unavoidable and ultimately beneficial, since honoring otherness while denying a  voice to the interpreter remains unfeasible. While some of the self-assurance of  literary criticism may well be lost when steering towards an implied-author-less line  of inquiry into the rhetorical and ethical complexities of literature, such plight of  uncertainty is probably intrinsic to all reading: however seemingly reassuring, the  implied author’s putatively inferrable meanings and ethical values cannot function  as a safety net for interpretation. </page> <page sequence="15"> 62 Maria Stefanescu Notes 1  A shorter version of this article was read on June 4, 2009 at the 24th  Annual Conference of the International Society for the Study of Narrative held  in Birmingham, England. I would like to thank Liesbeth Korthals Altes for the  critical and helpful comments she has since made on a subsequent draft. I would  also like to thank Steve Keteltas for his generous help with proof-reading. I am  especially grateful to David Herman for his extensive suggestions and valuable  recommendations throughout the process of revising this article.  2  In his critique of the concept, A. Nünning (92) has already remarked on the  potential restrictions on literary interpretation which are implied by the use of the  definite article. 3  For a related point about the potentially assimilative dimension inherent in the  very willingness to share in another’s perspective, see D. Parker: “The universalizing  act of putting myself in the other’s place carries the risk of projecting myself onto  the other, of reducing the other to the same” (159).   4  Given the lack of shared critical agreement on the issue, a hesitation will  be visible throughout this essay on whether to designate the implied author as he/ she or it. 5  The Levinasian echoes I have heard in Booth’s phases concern the ego’s  responsibility in face of the Other, whose presence “is this summons to respond”  (Levinas, Humanism 33) which compels self-denial and loss of agency (the I as  hostage) in the generosity of the “Here I am.” For a discussion of the paradox  involved in Levinas’s aversion to loss of selfhood when triggered by participation  in any kind of aesthetic experience, see Jill Robbins (86-90).            6  A self understood, as by Ricoeur, as non-coincident with the I, to the effect  that the demise of the philosophies of the cogito do not delegitimize a hermeneutics  of the self. “Credence without any guarantee” (Ricoeur 23), the attestation of the  self involves no certainty of unity or sameness through time but merely “a trust  in the power to say, in the power to do, in the power to recognize oneself as a  character in a narrative, in the power, finally, to respond to accusation in the form  of the accusative: “It’s me here” (me voici!)” (22).       7  Charles Altieri’s reservations against Booth’s 1988 metaphor of books as  offerings of friendship are grounded in the conviction that, at least occasionally,  readers will prefer engagement with “interesting enemies” rather than always  “admirable friends” (38). Along similar lines, C. Namwali Serpell has defended  an ethics of oscillation, which alternates between empathy and alterity instead of  merely synthesizing them with and into “liberal equanimity” (245).      </page> <page sequence="16"> Revisiting the Implied Author Yet Again: Why (Still) Bother? 63 8  For a very detailed and cogent reconstruction of the history of the notion  of an implied author, see Kindt &amp; Müller. Their suggestion that Booth’s concept  should be replaced by that of a “hypothetical”/ “postulated author” (181) seems  to me, however, a mere rephrasing of earlier proposals for an inferred, rather than  implied, author.  9  In his Rhetoric of Fiction, Booth actually refers to cases when “the second self  [the implied author] is given an overt, speaking role in the story” (71). However,  most other scholars seem to agree that “unlike the narrator, the implied author  can tell us nothing” (Chatman, Story 148), since he “never directly speaks to his  implied audience” (Nelles 26). 10  Martel, whose interviews Wolf quotes twice, contends that “What I was  trying to do in this book was try and discuss how we interpret reality . . . after all  Life of Pi is ultimately a religious novel” (qtd. in Wolf 122).   11  P. Rabinowitz’s rules of notice, signification, configuration and coherence  (43-45) would, I believe, equally apply to non-authorial interpretations, and therefore  cannot be resorted to as particularly reliable ‘means of demarcation.’ 12  Making a larger point about the presuppositions that precede and may  influence reading, P. Rabinowitz has also argued that “once [a pattern of coherence]  is found, it is nearly impossible to determine whether it is imposed on, rather than  invited by, the text” (181). 13  At the 2009 conference of the International Society for the Study of Narrative,  Luc Herman and Bart Vervaeck defended (in their paper “The Author as Implied  by the Reader”) the argument that all too often postulating an implied author’s  stance as the goal of literary interpretation actually came down to sanctioning one  specific reading or another. 14  B. Richardson, who contributes one of the latest additions to the topic,  defines the implied author as “the figure constructed by the reader of the person  who produced the narrative, and who may differ significantly from the actual flesh- and-blood author” (115). 15  The phrase “compartimentalized intentionalism” belongs to David Herman  (248).
