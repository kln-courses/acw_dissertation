<plain_text><page sequence="1">WORDS, OBJECTS, IDEAS: OHG GOTAWEBBI Helen Adolf, Pennsylvania State University In the course of readings which dealt with late Greek ideas about the Hereafter, I was struck by the Greek adjective deoixpavros from Seos, "God," and xxpaivw, "weave." Its meaning is "a deo textus," "woven by God." Could this be a model, or even the etymon, for OHG gotawebbi? Further reading disclosed that F. Holthausen had already voiced this opinion: "Godweb(bi)?nach gr. deo-ixpavrov";1 but how, when, and where could this have happened? An attempt will be made to answer these questions, even though the new Old High German Dictionary has not reached yet the letter G (for gotawebbi) nor the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae the letter T (for textus). The Greek adjective, as it is listed in Henri Etienne 's Thesaurus Graecae Linguae (1841), in Liddell-Scott, and in Demetrakou (1950), modifies nouns such as irop&lt;pvpa and 0-7-0X17; in the present instance, it accompanied the noun olv?cov. In all these cases, the meaning is an ecclesiastical, or rather, a mystical and spiritual one: the words des ignate the garment of immortality, i.e., the transfigured body, which the soul of the elect will be granted after death. These are gnostic con cepts, familiar to us from Revelation (6:11; 7:9; 19:8) and from St. Paul (II Corinthians 5:1 ff.), but belonging, so it is assumed,2 to the Indo-Iranian past, from whence they spread into the Younger Avesta, the writings of the Mandaeans, the Acts of Thomas, and the Dead Sea Scrolls. The garment itself was visualized in two different ways; it was either dazzling white/ like light itself, as in Revelation 19:8 ("fine linen, bright and pure"), or golden and embroidered with colors, like the cosmic mantle?hence the use of a noun such as wop&lt;pvpa. The exact terms may vary; instead of "woven by God," we may find "celestial, divine, not made by the hand of man; garment of life, of immortality," or simply, as in the Ascensio of Isaiah, "the garment" ?namely, the one that, along with a crown and a throne, represented the future reward of the saint.3 1 F.

The dictionary passages are taken from writings by Andreas of Crete, who lived between A.D. 660 and 740, and from the Barlaam and Josaphat story, the date of which is uncertain (seventh, eighth, or ninth cen tury) . The passage we found occurred in the apocryphal Testament of Abraham* which is in essence a work of the second or third century, whereas its wording, particularly in the recension A which contains our passage, may be much later (ninth or tenth century); but the editor, M. R. James, does not explicitly list deoixpavros among the dithematic epithets so dear to that later era. Perhaps it was the word's na?ve anthropomorphism which prevented its earlier entrance into the written language. In the fourth century, for example, a scholarly mind like that of Gregor of Nyssa, preferred a more cir cumstantial, but logically less offensive, expression. As if he had wanted to keep clear of Beovcpavros, he said in his funeral oration for Meletius: "He wears the raiment which the purity of his life has woven into a glorious dress."5 This is as far as one can go in the question of chronology. Laying aside this matter for future reconsideration, let us ask what connection there can be between the adjective 6eov&lt;pavros and the noun gotawebbi, which in OHG, OS, OE, OFris., and ON (guftvefr), denoted "a precious weaving or the vestment made of it," for use in church as well as in private life, but without any mystical connotation. The Latin lem mata6 for gotawebbi are chiefly : purpura, sericum, byssus, sindon, while nine more terms appear occasionally, called forth by the Bible passages dealing with the vestment of the High Priest and the curtain of the Tabernacle : scutulata, colobium, polymitum, polita, coccus, hyacinthus, ciclade, bombix, and the adjective carbaseus.7 Where gotawebbi, or its adjective gotawebbin, was used in connection with secular clothing, as in Eschatologie (1902), esp. pp. 63 ff.; R. Eisler, Weltenmantel und Himmelszelt, 1 (1910), 295 ff.; R. Reitzenstein, Die hellenistischen Mysterienreligionen (1910), pp. 29 ff., 106 ff.; Th. H.

We must not hope for an easy and rather obvious solution : namely, that BeovipavTos might have been the name given to a Byzantine fabric as a trade name. No fanciful names referring to theological con cepts are recorded for any of the early medieval fabrics.9 The nomen clature is geographical, technical, or social?indicating either the place of origin, or the material, color, number of yarns, shape of the trimmings, etc., or the rank of the prospective bearers of the fabrics, the "imperial" or "forbidden" ones (?Xarria KeKcoXvp?va) being most prized of all. Nor can we offer proof that the meeting between Greek and Germanic occurred in the East; for Gothic seems to have lacked gotawebbi. In the passage about the rich man, where the OHG Tatian translation says: "mit gotawebbi inti mit lininimo" (Luke 16:19), Wulfila follows the original almost verbally, by writing: "gawasids was paurpaurai jah bwssaun." This fact may mean that Greek deoixpavTos did not yet exist at that time, or had not been taken over by Gothic, or that it signified the "spiritual" dress only. At any rate, this leaves us at liberty to look for a center of diffusion in the West, perhaps with Latin as an intermediary. Before exploring this possibility, we should make sure that no other etymology is already at hand, which might obviate the dif ficulties presented by the deoixpavros theory. As a matter of fact, there are two older explanations. The first one sees in gota- nothing but an element of praise: "a divine or very pre cious web" (Bosworth-Toller), "textile divinum vel pretiosissimum" ( Grein-Koehler); this may mean introducing too modern a note into an archaic expression. Therefore Schade's view might be preferable: 8 Bosworth-Toller, An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary (1882-98); The Supplement to Bosworth-Toiler (1921). 9 See the lists in such works as J.

Grimm had voiced doubts in this respect:" Gottgeweb, wozu die Worte stimmen, bedarf doch n?herer Best?tigung."11 Hence another, and more ingenious, etymol ogy was welcomed by lexicographers: Graff had suggested that gota might correspond to ML coto, cotunum, "cotton." F. Seiler then ex plained more in detail how cotton imports from Spain and Sicily might have brought the Arabian word kod?n (now usually trans literated as qutn) to the West, where folk etymology connected it with "god," because of the use of those precious materials for the decoration of the altars.12 This theory led to a re-evaluation of the material implied by gotawebbi) it is "silk, cotton, or linen," according to the Supplement to Bosworth-Toller.13 Seller's theory breaks down under closer scrutiny, for chronology is against it. J. Corominas14 states that cotton imports into Spain did not start until the first half of the tenth century. At that time, moreover, the word for "cotton" was algot?n, whereas the first softened form, algod?n, does not appear until the later part of the thirteenth century?and this would be the form required to mediate between Arab, qutn and, say, OE godweb. If we therefore reject the Arabic word for "cotton" as an etymol ogy for gotawebbi and the related Germanic expressions, this does not mean that gotawebbi, as it is used in our old texts and glossaries, did not at times denote a cotton fabric, for the simple reason that the Old Testament text which underlies most of these passages did not clearly distinguish between the vegetable fibres cotton and linen?the one important thing was to make sure that no animal product such as wool was used in the service of the Temple.15 Thus, wherever the Septuagint or Vulgate reads byssos, the meaning may be doubtful, since byssos corresponds to three different terms in Hebrew (buts, shesh, chur), which do not (as do Hebr. peshet, bad, etun) stand for 10 O.

Seiler, Die Entwicklung der deutschen Kultur im Spiegel des deutschen Lehn worts, I (1905), 211. 13 We find something similar in Old Russian. The word pavaloka, a counterpart of gotawebbi, is defined as "a foreign fabric made of cotton or silk" by M. Vasmer, Rus sisches etymologisches W?rterbuch (1954). F. Miklosich {Etymologisches W?rterbuch der slawischen Sprachen, 1886) had mentioned the "cotton theory" in his discussion of the Old Slavonic loanword godovabla, ?. hedvab. 14 J.

Mackie, in Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible (1905), 1, 623, under "Dress."</page><page sequence="5">446 Adolf "linen" alone. The prevailing confusion is shown by the fact that two words originally meaning "cotton," namely sindon (Indish) and carbaseus (Persian), eventually acquired the meaning of "linen" in Latin, whereas Arab, qutn itself is derived from a Semitic root mean ing "flax."16 Or let us look at bombyx, one of the lemmata for gotawebbi. It denotes either silk, Bombyx mori (the mulberry tree silk worm), or Coic silk (a variety produced on the Isle of Cos), or cotton, Bombax gossipii or Xyli (also called lana, or lanugo, Xyli, or Gossipium her baceum or arbor eum)}1 For our special purpose, however, it does not matter at all whether the Biblical words in question refer to linen or to cotton; we should only like to know if at the time when gotawebbi came into use, people had become cotton-conscious, i.e., aware of a new material of foreign origin, and this does not seem to be so. In the nineteenth book of Isidore's Etymologies where colors, clothes, and fabrics are dealt with, silk, linen, and wool areanentioned exclusively;18 and the invasion of Spain by the Arabs (711) did not bring about an immediate change, as we have heard above. Accordingly, new terms in French and German do not crop up until the twelfth century: MHG boumwol, OF auqueton, hoqueton, followed by coton in the thirteenth century.19 At first, these terms denoted something soft, fluffy, and fit for padding (cotton wool, NHG "Watte"): linde sam ein boumwol, Erec 7702; the color is a dazzling white: "blanche ot la barbe aussi come auqueton," Roman de Roncevaux. It took some time until those words were used in a more general way for a textile, or piece of cloth ing. It is obvious that gotawebbi is much older than this "cotton boom." It occurs first, it seems, in line 587 of the OE Exodus, which belongs approximately to the first half of the eighth century,20 and in this poem the word is already firmly entrenched in alliterative poetry: "gold und godweb, Josephes gestre?n, wera wuldorgesteald." The same holds true for the Heliand (vv. 3330. 3782) and for Otfried (V, 19, 45). Erdmann in his edition of Otfried states explicitly that the word has already become obsolete: udiuro wati is verdeutlichende 16 K.

One may therefore argue that the word was West Germanic. Indeed, after A.D. 450, OHG and OE went different ways with respect to loanwords from the silk trade: thus OHG pfellel was an early, but OE p ll a late, borrowing; OHG side (NHG Seide, seta s?rica, Fr. soie) was an import from the South, whereas OE seolc probably came by the Northern route from the East. "Gold und godweb"?we may well ask, in the history of textiles,21 which fabrics were in those days as valuable as gold. The answer is silk and linen, but hardly cotton. Even before 552, when Emperor Justinian introduced the culture of the silk worm in Greece, silk was very much in demand; the fact is attested by writers like Jerome, Eusebius, and Ammianus Marcellinus for the Eastern provinces, by Prudentius and Victricius of Rouen for the West. Ghesqui?re com ments on the Victricius passage with the following words: "Jam turn ergo sericae vestes et quidem arte quadam mira crispatae, non modo notae in Galliis erant sed et ab iis gestabantur feminis quas singularis modestia non commendabat."22 After 552 the supply became more copious,23 and Constantinople joined the other great centers of silk in dustry, Persia, Egypt, and Syria. Silk at that time also supplanted wool as a basis for weavings and embroideries with gold threads; but ON gu^vefr still meant the woolen fabric, perhaps because the climate of the North favored the choice of such a material.24 Northern sources do not mention cotton until much later, when coarser stuffs, like fust?n (from Fostat, Kairo) and b?kran (from Bochara) made their appearance. Linen, on the other hand, domestic or foreign, white, interwoven with gold, or "twice dyed in purple" was highly valued, as is evident, for example, from Angilbert's description of Charle magne's wardrobe.25 In the case of linen, we can demonstrate how an Oriental merchandise and its name traveled West: Goth, saban (Gr. (TLvo?v "fine linen," "cloth," Matt. 27:59) is derived from Saban, a 21 Apart from the works already mentioned, see 0. v. Falke, Decorative Silks, 3rd ed. (1936); A. F.

Now we must point to a strange fact that may be of relevance. Chroniclers agree that precious fabrics, especially the silks, not only gratified the vanity of the rich and worldly, but also served a loftier purpose: they were used for wrapping up the relics of the saints.27 Through such a procedure, the "spiritual" dress ("woven by God," Seoixpavros) might have become the tan gible dress (gotawebbi). Let us investigate this possibility. The custom originated in the East.28 In the middle of the fourth century, when Christianity began to supplant paganism in the Roman Empire, the worship of saints had to supplant the cult of pagan heroes.29 The martyrs of the first two centuries (Stephen, Ignatius, Polycarp), the twin saints Gervase and Protase30 were hailed as in visible helpers in the struggle against those enemies of the Church, the heretic Arians. The demand for such "helpers," for relics of the saints to be placed under the altars of the many churches, became so great that following an Eastern practice, the holy remains were often di vided into parts, since a supernatural power was no less active in a part than in the whole.31 That the relics were wrapped in costly fabrics, was because of the love of splendor in imperial Rome and the funeral customs of ancient Egypt; in order to become an "Osiris," the de ceased had to don the god's resplendent attire.32 Persons who could afford it had themselves buried in gold and silk fabrics, much to the 26 K.

Nee deest quod miremur: pro regali amictu praesto est aeterni luminis indumentum."Zh But this remarkable attempt to make people see the invisible, was, by the very nature of people, doomed to failure, and policies had to be reversed : in order to compete successfully with worldly magnificence, the holy martyrs, too, i.e., their relics when carried in triumphal procession, were henceforth surrounded with glory visible to the eye. And how else could the use of gorgeous fabrics be justified, if not by calling them visible signs of celestial glory, garments "woven by God" for the elect? We hope that this is more than an ingenious theory; evidence to support it is certainly not entirely lacking. A methodical search among legends has yielded almost thirty cases in which a saint is said to have received a piece of clothing as a gift from Heaven.36 Originally, the gift must have meant the transfiguration of the saint's body; but as the Gnostic idea faded out, the miracle was reinterpreted as being 1. a gift to martyrs of both sexes, to protect their chastity or decency; 2. a substitution for a garment given to the poor; 33 See, e.g., Jerome in his life of St. Paul the Hermit: "Cur et mortuos vestros auratis obvolvitis vestibus? ... an cadavera divitum nisi in s?rico putrescere nesci unt?" (Migne, PL, xxm, col. 29). 34 "Ille vestem Christi, nudus licet, tamen serva vit: vos vestiti seri?is, indumentum Christi perdidistis. Paulus vilissimo pulvere coopertus jacet resurrecturus in gloriam, vos operosa saxis sepulcra premunt cum vestris opibus arsuros" {ibid.).

Of special interest are the instances in which a chasuble ("cas ula") is given to Bonus?also called Bonitus or Bonitius?(Jan. iS)&gt; a "vestis" to Ildefons of Toledo (Jan. 23), a "stola" to Hubertus (Nov. 3), and a funeral cloth to Servatius (May 13; see later) ; for these celestial gifts share the distinction of having been shown, for many centuries, to the public.37 Descriptions of them still exist today, as does a picture of the white-and-gold "stola" of Hubertus ("s?rica" or "byssina," auroque con texta).38 The original meaning of these celestial garments is most clearly expressed in the case of the Gallic saint Valerius, Bishop of Langres, who lived around 264, according to Potthast, or in the third or fifth century, according to the AASS. To him an angel brought "stolam summo splendore ac candore micantem" and said: "The Lord sends you this; cover yourself with this 'virtutis indumento et justitiae stola/ which you will receive in the Land of the Blessed (felici in patria)." Thus while still in the flesh (necdum exutus carnis tunica) the saint was adorned with a starry dress (syderea exornaretur prae texta), which became visible while he was still of this world.39 Such a dress could even become tangible?as we learn from a passage in the Vita Martini (ch. 23) by Sulpicius Severus (ca. A.D. 397). There we read how an evil monk named Anatolius boasted to Clarus, one of the disciples of St. Martin, that he, Anatolius, was blessed with the power of the Lord, and that in token of it, he would appear before others in a garment given by the Lord: "Ecce hac nocte vestem mihi candidam Dominus de c?elo dabit qua indutus in medio vestrum diversabor idque vobis signum erit, in me Dei esse virtutem, qui Dei veste donatus sim."40 He made good his promise, and the garment was carefully inspected: it was soft and white and glittering with purple, but of an unknown texture and material ("ad hibitoque lumine vestem omnes diligenter inspiciunt. Erat autem 87 A linen cloth given to the Benedictine nun Amadea was likewise exhibited; see G?nter, Psychologie, p. 105. 38 AASS (Nov.) 1, 867 f. 89 AASS (Oct.) ix, 533 40 Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinomm, 1 (1866), 132 ff.</page><page sequence="10">Words, Objects, Ideas: OHG "gotawebbi" 451 summa mollitie, candore eximio, micanti purpura, nec tarnen, cuius esset generis aut velleris, poterat agnosci : curiosis tarnen oculis aut digitis adtrectata non aliud quam vestis videbatur"). However, they dragged the monk before St. Martin, and there "God's vestment" vanished into thin air: "inter trahentium manus vestis evanuit." This story, to be sure, does not appear among the "gifts from Heaven" listed by the historians of legend, for it belongs in a different category, perhaps "devilish gifts," or "spell and counterspell." But negative as it is, it is even more revealing than its positive counter part. It tells us that people in those days were perfectly willing to be lieve in the physical existence of such a heavenly dress; one had only to beware of counterfeits. And there were definite notions as to color and material of the garment; coming from the looms of Heaven, the fabric had, at the very least, to look exotic. Sulpicius Severus was not the only one to say so; we find the same remark in a twelfth century legend. We read, for example, in Adgar's version of the miracle of St. Bonitus of Clermont, that Bishop Herbert of Norwich was shown the "glorious vestment" and tried in vain to ascertain its nature: Si s'entremist de l'entendre Le quel il fust: u linge, u lange; Tant ert le vestement estrange; N'est merveille, s'il mist peine, Kar n'est pas de faiture humaine.41 Instead of that Biblical expression, "not made by the hand of man," Severus had "Dei veste donatus," which comes very near to being the link, hitherto missing, between Beov?avros and gotawebbi. "Dei veste donatus" might call forth a *vestis a deo data, or, since the preposition might be dropped as in the name Deodatus, instead of Adeodatus,42 *vestis deodata; these expressions could alternate with vestis a deo texta, or *deotexta. To be sure, *deotexta would be not a noun, but an adjective; however, since Latin textum and textus were nouns as well as participles, a noun *deotextum, "Gottesgewebe," or "celestial fabric," could easily evolve from the adjective. Let us now look back at Greek Oeovcpavros. It was queried whether this compound might not predate, say, 700; we feel inclined to as sume this, on the strength of the Severus passage and the strange re ligious concepts it discloses for the time of early Christianity in Gaul. 41 Altfranz?sische Bibliothek, No. 9 (1886), ed. C. Neuhaus, vv. 162-66. 42 These names are derived from Greek Theodor, Theodosius, Theodotus, and from Hebrew Elchanan (II Samuel 21:19); see the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae.</page><page sequence="11">452 Adolf It is a well-known fact that Gnostic miracle tales circulated among the Gallic ascetics and deeply stirred them;43 they might have heard about deoxxpavTos, word as well as idea, through the same channels. If we refuse to admit such a transference, then we must assume that the same line of ideas developed twice, earlier and more radically in the West, later and more cautiously in the East; this is possible, but less likely. This is as far as we can go, on the basis of the available material, in our attempt to prove that gotawebbi is derived, indirectly, from Greek deoixpavros, with a Latin locution, *a deo texta, acting as in termediary. Perhaps it will be possible one day to eliminate the as terisk. Should the Latin term actually be found in a suitable context (the collections of the Thesaurus may help to find such a treasure), then our conjecture might become a certainty, and deoxxpavros be considered definitely as the etymon of gotawebbi. Still, our task is not yet at and end. We have to investigate more closely the psychology involved in the gotawebbi concept, in the transition from a spiritual object to one that is material. The later stages of the Angel Cloth motif may shed some light on the less ob vious beginnings, and we therefore turn our attention to the legend of St. Servatius. Heinrich von Veldeke tells us in his version of the legend how a purple cloth was brought down from Heaven by the hands of angels in order to cover the remains, or the tomb, of the great saint Servatius (3176 eyn duere decksele van pellen, or, as Frings reconstructs it, 3151 einen duren pellen; 4103 ff.).44 This purple cloth ("une ?toffe rouge ou pourpre") was actually in existence until 1579, when it was hidden away in a chest with two other fabrics and lost during the siege of Maastricht.45 No angelic cloth is mentioned in the older sources: the Historia Sacra of Sulpicius Severus, Gregory of Tours,46 the Gesta Antiquiora 43 A. Hauck, Kirchengeschichte Deutschlands, 3rd and 4th ed. (1904), 1, 59 ff. 44 Th. Frings and G. Schieb, Drei Veldekestudien (1949), p. 17; Th. Frings and G. Schieb, PBB, lxx (1948), 151 ff. This cloth also plays a part in the legend of St. Norbert, Bishop of Magdeburg in the twelfth century; see Frings-Schieb, PBB, lxx, 156. Cf. also the SS. Rer. Merov., xn (1856), 705 (ed. R. Koepke). 45 F. Bock and M. Willemsen, Antiquit?s Sacr?es conserv?es dans les anciennes coll?giales de S. Servais et de Notre-Dame ?

Krusch, Gregorii Turonensis Opera, 1884).</page><page sequence="12">Words, Objects, Ideas: OHG "gotawebbi" 453 (ninth century), and the version by Heriger (tenth century).47 The "sericum" appears in the eleventh century only; we find it in Veldeke's model (the Trier MS T), in the Upper German Servatius, the Jocundus version, the A ASS, the Maestricht Breviary. At first blush, it might seem as if this were only one more miracle attributed to the "great lord of Maastricht"; just as Heaven had bestowed on him tangible gifts during his lifetime?a drinking goblet, a crozier, even a key handed over to him by St. Peter himself48?so he was also to be honored in death: Die qua vitam mundi exalavit, Celitus missa purpura vola vit Super beati corpus antistitis Atque velavit.49 However, the gift of such a funeral cloth has even greater significance : it meant recognition of the highest spiritual status. We have seen how Christendom, ever since the fourth century, had placed itself under the protection of the holy martyrs; at a time when the custom of papal canonization was not entirely established, they were considered as the saints kat'exochen.50 Soon, however, the idea developed that nonmartyrs, the so-called confessors, were worthy of equal honors, especially if their austerities constituted an unbloody martyrdom. Such a hope is expressed in the ninth-century legend of Servatius: "Et junctus est illis qui stolas suas laverunt in sanguine agni, nam licet tempore transitus sui per martyrium non migravit de mundo, gloria tarnen martyrii non carebit."51 But such a hope was not quite free from doubt. In the case of Servatius, there was the disquiet ing comparison with the protomartyr Stephen. When Servatius, ac cording to the legend, went to Rome to pray that Maastricht might be saved from the Huns, St. Peter told him that only the church of Metz, resting place of the bones of St. Stephen, could escape destruc 47 G.

Cattol. under "Canonizzazione"). 61 Analecta Bollandiana, 1 (1882), 85 ff., 93 ff.</page><page sequence="13">^54 Adolf tion.52 Could not this give rise to the idea that Servatius was inferior to Stephen, because he was a confessor, and not a martyr? To remove any such doubt, so it seems, the Angel Cloth was introduced into his story. In the picture language of the early Middle Ages, the argument was convincing: the "stola gloriae," the heavenly cloth made visible, meant the admission into glory, and tombs of saints or saintly men had therefore to be decorated with silken fabrics.53 As to St. Servatius, one may assume that he received the purple "sericum" at a liturgical feast?"elevatio" or "translatio" of his earthly remains?in the eleventh century. The additional attribute that it was a cloth brought down from Heaven, coincided with the Servatius legend; even with out it, the "sericum" would have signified the garment of glory, woven-by-God. This point seems relevant to our investigation. It reveals, for those minds of the past, a blurring of the demarcation line between the spiritual and the tangible. Or we might say that for medieval sym bolism, things of splendor and beauty lay at the intersection of two planes of existence, the earthly and the divine?these two to be con ceived not as a sequence in time, but as an interp?n?tration in space. Thus King Philip and his Queen parading in their imperial robes at the Magdeburg Christmas celebration, represent Trinity and Queen of the Angels in the eyes of the poet Walter, as if life, in such height ened moments, had become transparent. In later centuries, it was painting that intimated the invisible by means of the visible: hence the splendid garbs in the Ghent Altarpiece by the Van Eycks, in the All-Saints picture by D?rer, in the "Burial of Count ?rgaz" by El Greco. It is not the Saints that are dressed like the clergy,54 but on the contrary, Emperor, Pope, and Clergy were dressed like saints wearing the garment of glory. Similarly, the priest reciting at Holy Service the words: "Redde mihi Domine stolam immortalitatis,"55 already had donned this stola, in virtue of his office. Because the "garment" had a twofold origin?Iranian cosmic 62 "Id protomartyr Stephanus ob sui corporis pignora quae ibi servantur, apud Christum Dominum nostrum, quem pro se ad dexteram Patris stantem vidit, ob tinuit,, (Analecta, p. 107; Bibliotheca Hagiographica Latina Nr. 7614, 7615, 7616. 63 See the stories connected with the tomb of St. Austremonius, Bishop of Auvergne, and with that of St. Gorgonius (F. Bock, Geschichte der liturgischen Gew?nder des Mittelalters (1889), in, 169 f.; also Gregory of Tours, In Gloria Confessorum, cf. XXX). 64 As J. Ebersolt meant: "Aux yeux des hommes de ce temps le costume imp?rial ?tait si riche, si beau, que les artistes en paraient les anges eux-m?mes" (op. cit., p. 74). M F.

The white looks back on a venerable history,56 and we may feel that it expresses best of all the purity of the angelic condition; but the concept of the gold cloth, too, must be rooted in human nature as well as in tradition, otherwise, why should Rousseau have had such a fabric laid on the face of his sainted Julie?57 Its threefold meaning is death, entrance into glory, and the secret of a Love that was earthly as well as divine. But the fact that an eighteenth-century poet unwittingly revived Merovingian funeral practices, proves the perennial strength of the language of symbols. Gotawebbi, the OHG word we have tried to explain, marks the beginning, not the end, of an evolution which led from late Greek and early Christian spiritualism to the symbolism of the Middle Ages. Three languages, and three civilizations, seem to have shaped it: Greek, Latin, and Germanic. The circumstance that the Germanic tribes were heathen rather than Christian, need not deter us, since loanwords like Kirche, Bischof, Engel, Teufel, belong to the same period; thus Streitberg argues: "Die Westgermanen m?ssen also schon Jahrhunderte vor ihrer Bekehrung eine gewisse Vertrautheit mit dem Christentum gehabt haben."58 Romans and West Germanic people met mostly along the Rhine; but were there also Greek influences in such surroundings? Here we may benefit by the debate on loanwords such as Pfafe, Samstag, Kirche. Raumer and Kluge held that these words had been borrowed from Gothic; but church history59 suggested to U. Stutz and to Streitberg a different origin. To them, the fourth century Christians in Metz, Tr?ves, and Cologne were a mixed group understanding Greek as well as Latin, who might therefore have been responsible for the introduction of the above mentioned loanwords. I may add that such circles could also have coined the loan-transla tions armahairts and haithno,*0 and gotawebbi, too, if this word, as has been suggested, followed a Latin pattern (*a deo textus) ultimately derived from the Greek {Seoixpavros). 66 From Vergil's fifth eclogue ("candidus Daphnis") to the Merovingian denizens of Heaven ("albati, candidati," see SS. Rer. Merov., iv [1902]) and to the "candida legio" of the Crusaders (see Helen Adolf, Speculum, xxxn (1957), 108 f.). 67 J. J. Rousseau, La nouvelle H?loise, ed. by Daniel Mornet (1925), iv, 328 f.

Is it an oversimplification if we attribute a dualistic spiritualism to the Greeks, a monistic spiritualism to the Galloromans, and the final secu larization to the Teutons? One may think of the Frankish nobleman who, according to Gregory of Tours,61 grabbed a cloth, "pallam holosiricam auroque exornatam,,, in the Church of St. Denis, or of Gerberga, duchess of Lorraine, who snatched a precious "sericum" from the treasury of St. Servatius, to have a "russolembum" (what ever finery that meant) made out of it for herself.62 These were people of strong earthly appetites and a robust common sense, for whom a textile was a textile, and a gotawebbi definitely something woven by the hands of man. No wonder the word came to mean something en tirely worldly. As silk imports increased after 552, the Latin name of the mer chandise invaded the German territory: palleolum, pallium, palla. With consonant shift, umlaut, and loss of the semivowel as in native German words, palleolum became OHG pfellelf* the borrowing must have occurred in the sixth century, before 600,64 As was mentioned before, OE, by this time, went its own way: p ll is a late loanword, as can be seen from the lack of breaking (Brechung).65 For a short while, gotawebbi lived on in alliterative poetry, then it sank into ob livion. Our excursion into the history of the word has now revealed to us something about its past: the object it denoted, the ideas that en nobled the object. 61 Gregory of Tours, In Gloria Martyrum, i, ch. 71. 62 Ghesqui?re, op. cit., 1, p. 206, ?38; also in F.
