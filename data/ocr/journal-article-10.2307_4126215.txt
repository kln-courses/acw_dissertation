With many sculptures lacking clear archaeological contexts and the ever-present con- cern about forgeries, any significant advance in our un- derstanding of these works has seemed unlikely. By focus- ing on paint traces, a rarely-studied detail of the sculp- tures, this article suggests that a small group of folded- arm figures (FAFs), preserved with red vertical stripes painted on their cheeks, represent mourning figures used in funerary ritual. Combining close observation of the FAFs and their one assured context (in graves), ancient Greek evidence about figure use and funerals, as well as ethnographic study of figure uses, it is argued that Cycladic figures had a use-life before burial and that figures would be painted multiple times and with different motifs to reflect their changing roles in such events as initiations, marriages, and funerals. Finally, the Cycladic figures may reflect the development of ancestor ritual in Early Cycladic society in part as a response to scarce natural resources.* The importance of proper mourning for the dead is evident in fifth-century Greek art and literature, where women's roles in funerals were especially crit- ical. Much earlier, ca. 2500 B.C., women's roles as mourners were probably equally central to society. At that time, I will argue, important individuals were mourned through the display during a funeral cer- emony of painted marble sculptures which were then left as offerings in the deceased's grave. The details of public funerals and their functions within society change through time; however, close examination of the actual expressions and gestures of grief as well as women's central role in mourning show that these elements of the funeral remain remarkably consistent over the millennia separating fifth-centu- ry Athens from the Early Bronze Age Cyclades. Since their discovery in the early 19th century, Cycladic marble figures have provoked speculation about their possible uses and meanings.' A full un- derstanding of the functions of Cycladic figures in Early Cycladic society is limited by a lack of clear archaeological contexts,2 while an understanding of their meanings is hampered by the absence of textual evidence and the roughly 4,500 years sepa- rating us from the culture that made them. Al- though from such a distance we can only hypothe- size about the rituals and ideology of Early Cycladic islanders, a frequently overlooked feature of the figures-traces of painted decoration-may offer a way to refine our interpretations of their functions. Perhaps because paint is easily visible on rela- tively few figures (and is poorly preserved) little in- depth consideration exists about its significance. A recent dissertation by Hendrix provides the full- est corpus to date of painted figures.3 In some cas- es, purely anatomical features are rendered, though in others, decorative patterns are drawn on the fig- ures' surfaces. Commentators have suggested these patterns signal a practice of tattooing or body paint- ing in Early Cycladic culture.4 A few have gone fur- * I would like to acknowledge the many people who have helped and encouraged me with this article, especially Pat Getz- Gentle, Elizabeth Hendrix, Arthur W. Hoffman, andJoyce L. Hoffman; Gregory Nagy and the Center for Hellenic Studies, especially their librarians who worked tirelessly to acquire re- search materials for me;J.J. Pollitt, Lauren Talalay, and Gor- don Williams. I would like to thank the two anonymous AJA readers whose comments and suggestions were very construc- tive and helpful. And I would also like to thank audiences of Yale alumni and at lectures at Boston College, George Wash- ington University, Miami of Ohio, Rice, Wesleyan, William and Mary, andYale. 1 On the distinction between use or function and meaning, see Talalay 1993, 38. 2 Nearly all who discuss the figures lament the loss of archae- ological contexts. On this catastrophe, see esp. Gill and Chip- pindale 1993. There are also some who argue scholarly work on the figures should be limited because of the lack of prove- nance and because it serves to encourage the market for these objects. On the debate, Broodbank 2000, 58-65; 1992; Sher- ratt 2000, 137-8; Renfrew 1991, 21-4; 1993; Cherry 1992, 140- 4; Elia 1993. SHendrix 2000. For a brief discussion, see Hendrix 1997- 1998, 4-15. 4 Given the variety of materials dedicated to paint prepara- tion and application that have been found (pigment,jars with stored pigment, bowls for grinding, palettes for paint prepara- tion, bone and bronze tubes for application), certainly body painting must have been an important part of Cycladic culture. Renfrew 1991, 122; Getz-Preziosi 1985, 55; Zervos 1957, 44. Tattooing may also have been practiced. Bonn 1996; Brood- bank 2000, 248 (where he observes that copper needles found in graves could serve for tattooing); Sherratt 2000, 43-5. Cin- nabar would be toxic if used for tattooing (ibid. 117-8). Carter 1994, 136-7 suggests that obsidian and metal blades found in graves were used for shaving, however, such implements might also be suitable for cicatrization (scarification) or even in some cases, tattooing. On metal use, see Nakou 1995. 525 American Journal of Archaeology 106 (2002) 525-50</page><page sequence="2">526 GAIL L. HOFFMAN [AJA 106 ther, proposing that these decorations "may reflect the way the faces of the dead were painted for buri- al,"5 even stating, "It is tempting to think that the skin of the deceased owner of a figure (and per- haps his mourners as well) would have been paint- ed with the same patterns as part of the funeral preparations."6 I take this observation further to argue that some Cycladic figures were painted at the time of the funerary ritual with red vertical stri- ations on their cheeks intended to reproduce the effect of facial laceration. These figures were then carried as representations of mourners during the funeral before finally being placed as images of mourners in some graves. Also, because a variety of different patterns are painted on the figures, their use as mourners reflects only one among a number of possible functions. Other decorations may pre- serve evidence for the figures' use in puberty, initi- ation, or marriage rituals. An answer to why such elaborate figures were created at all may be linked to practices of prestige display and perhaps the existence of ancestor ritual, which is a common fea- ture of early village societies. In the Cyclades, an- cestor ritual may also have developed, in part, as a response to scarce natural resources. CYCLADIC FIGURES Sculptures with Painted Vertical Striations There are three Cycladic heads and two (per- haps three) full figures that preserve traces of red painted vertical striations on the cheeks. One head, said by Wolters to be from Amorgos, is now in the Athens National Museum (fig. 1).7 Unusually large, it measures 29 cm. Since the largest preserved com- plete statue has a smaller head (ca. 25 cm) and a total height of about 1.48 m,8 if we had the body belonging to the Athens head, it would presum- ably constitute a nearly life-size sculpture. In addi- tion to its unusual size, the sculpted ears and mouth are also atypical-most Cycladic heads lack both Fig. 1. Athens N.M. inv. no. 3909. Cycladic head, 29 cm, said to be from Amorgos.

A drawing from the 1890s (fig. 2) records painted remains of vertical striations on the right cheek as well as further traces of painted eyes. A second head, in the Copenhagen National Mu- seum, is only slightly smaller, measuring 24.61 cm (fig. 3).10 The painted vertical red marks on both cheeks are well-preserved, four on either side, as 5 Getz-Preziosi 1987, 53; see also Goodison 1989, 11; Dou- mas 1968, 52. 6 Getz-Preziosi 1987, 107.

(After Getz-Preziosi 1987, fig. 42h, with permission from The University of Michigan Press) the total number of figures preserved with such marks would not exceed a dozen, hence these fig- ures stand out as special.'8 Not only is their painted decoration unusual, but their size distinguishes them as well. Four out of the five figures in this corpus would be larger than 70 cm if the complete statues were preserved. Authenticity Because of the popularity of Cycladic sculptures on the art market and the consequent production of forgeries, the authenticity of any Cycladic sculpture must always be considered. The head from the Ath- ens National Museum was first reported in 1888 as part of the collection of the Archaeological Society in Greece (4270), it eventually became part of the National Archaeological Museum's collection Fig. 5. Drawing of head in private collection, 13.4 cm. (After Getz-Preziosi 1987, fig. 42f, with permission from The University of Michigan Press) (3909). Wolters claimed that it came from Amorgos, and, indeed, in the late 1880s, Tsountas excavated a number of other figures from graves on that island.'9 The early date of its appearance (before the sculp- tures were especially popular with collectors- Wolters described it as "repulsively ugly") and its accession directly into a museum collection give it (of all the pieces listed here) the best claim to au- thenticity.20 The Copenhagen National Museum head was also acquired early (at the beginning of the 20th century), well before the most active period of Cycladic forgery production (the 1960s). Of less certain antiquity are the head in a private collection (fig. 5) or the Goulandris pieces (figs. 6-7). The two sculptures with the best claim to authenticity (the Athens and Copenhagen heads), however, preserve the paint traces most completely.21 Since at the time 18 Hendrix 2000, 145-6 calls the pattern "stripes" and notes that it is an infrequent motif. Hendrix's dissertation includes 65 figures with paint traces, approximately 53 of these have some type of nonanatomical decoration. However, Hendrix (2000, 8) has drawn over 400 figures,just under halfwith paint traces. '9 Tsountas 1898,154-5. See Athens National Museum 3978 for an example excavated by Tsountas from Amorgos. 20 Renfrew (1985-1986,141) states that the Athens National Museum head's authenticityis "unimpeachable." Gill and Chip- pindale (1993, 628) question the authenticity of all large fig- ures, though they also note (656 n. 405) that paint traces on figures found before paint was generally recognized as part of the figures might prove useful in establishing authenticity. Sherratt (2000, 131 n. 14) argues against paint as a sign of authenticity. She also (2000, 126) says the statues were "much sought after by collectors from the nineteenth century... to the present day." Certainly the display of the Louvre head in the early 20th century and the interest generated among modem artists affected the popularity and perception of the sculptures (Rubin 1984; Sachini 1984). 21 Preziosi and Weinberg (1970, 11): "it seems impossible that such subtleties as paint ghosts would have been part of the forger's craft more than twentyyears ago." Hendrix (2000, 1-5) reviews discussion of paint traces in the publications on the figures and notes that it has been observed by some schol- ars from the start.</page><page sequence="5">2002] EARLY CYCLADIC II MOURNING FIGURES 529 of their acquisition paint would probably not have added to a statue's value, and by the 1960s paint traces might have adversely affected a statue's mar- ketability,22 the Athens and Copenhagen heads are most likely genuine, and the other painted figures are probably authentic as well. Typology The high point for figure production occurred during the Early Cycladic II period when the major- ity of the figures are nude forms with folded arms, hence the acronym FAF (folded-arm figure). Thin and abstract in rendering, the only other carved de- tails frequently are a triangular nose, small breasts, and an engraved pubic triangle. Although the FAFs are almost always termed female, in fact, the sexual characteristics are not always explicit. Those figures that include breasts and engraved pubic triangles are female. There are numerous FAFs, however, with- out engraved pubic triangles and since the breasts are often small or lacking, one might question the sexual identity of these pieces.23 Paint traces may be crucial here, too, since the pubic area was often paint- ed blue. Their heads tilt back slightly, their knees are bent, and their feet point down and turn out, making it impossible for them to stand on their own. Hence, most conclude that they were intended to recline, to be propped against a wall, or to be carried for display.24 The figures range in size from less than 10 cm to about life-size, although the majority are around 30 cm.25 Occasionally they are depicted preg- nant or show what scholars sometimes identify as post- partum marks.26 Male FAFs are exceptionally rare.27 Indeed, when male figures occur they generally be- long to unusual sculptural types such as musicians Fig. 6. Goulandris Collection 253, 14.8 cm, drawing of facial markings. (Drawing courtesy of E. Hendrix) (lyre or pipe-players), seated drinkers, or multiple figure groups.28 Alongside these more "naturalistic" forms, schematic figures were also produced.29 Although the separation of figures into groups is debated and the attribution of figures to sculptural hands is highly controversial,30 Renfrew has proposed a typology for the figures, and Getz-Gentle (believ- ing that a system of proportions was used in their creation) has attributed some works to specific carv- ers.31 All of the sculptures described above would 22 Sherratt (2000, 131 n. 14) says the Ashmolean figures were most assiduously cleaned during the 1960s. 23 Knapp and Meskell (1997, 185-7, 190, 193-5, 197) com- ment on the frequent assumptions made in figure studies about sex and gender. 24 Getz-Gentle 2001, 33-6; Getz-Preziosi 1987, 25, 32; Dou- mas 1968, 89-90 (where he notes a schematic idol was exca- vated placed upright in a grave); Fitton 1989, 40, 67; Goodison 1989, 8; Thimme 1965, 78, 80.

HOFFMAN [AJA 106 belong to the figure type known as FAFs. In Ren- frew's typology all but the Athens National Museum head (fig. 1) would belong to a group designated "Spedos" figures."3 In addition, Getz-Gentle has at- tributed the Copenhagen head and the head in a private collection (figs. 3-5), based on the overall contour of the head and the semi-conical shape and placement of the nose on the head, to the Goulan- dris sculptor, apparently the most prolific Early Cy- cladic II carver."3 Folded Arm Gesture The most characteristic feature of the Early Cy- cladic II sculptures is their folded-arm gesture; its interpretation has puzzled scholars. Some propose that it should be associated with death, that is, the folded arms combined with a reclining posture in- dicate that the figures mimic the posture of a corpse. Although an apparently attractive explana- tion, this proposal ignores what we do know of Cy- cladic burial practice, that bodies were buried in a contracted posture with hands turned upward in front of the body (not across the body), a posture quite unlike that of the FAFs.34 Getz-Gentle had ar- gued that the folded-arm gesture held no signifi- cance with respect to the use or meaning of the figure, but rather was to be explained by sculptors gravitating toward a form that minimized the risk of breakage and also eased manufacture. Other schol- ars concurred, citing the limitations of working in marble and of sculpting techniques.35 More recent- ly, however, Getz-Gentle suggests that the gesture may reference childbirth.36 Renfrew believes the gesture is critical to the sculpture's function and signals respect when found on the smaller figures (which he considers votaries) and then a gesture of epiphany when found on the larger figures (which he argues are divinities)."7 If these figures served multiple purposes during the course of their use, perhaps this gesture was created because of its potential for multiple interpretations. (For exam- ple, in ancient Egypt, cradling the breasts was an accepted way to depict mourning. In a modern con- text, however, crossed arms can express either re- pose or great pain and distress.)38 Paint Some (perhaps most) of these sculptures were painted with blue (azurite) and red (cinnabar) color.39 Generally, however, all trace of paint has disappeared, although occasionally the blue paint left a faint relief ghost where it temporarily pro- tected the stone from abrasion and corrosion. Where paint traces do remain, eyes, eyebrows, and hair have been observed (rarely, ears and nostrils). The pubic area was often colored. There are also decorative patterns (primarily stripes or dots) painted on the cheeks, foreheads, and chins of some figures as well as zigzags and non-anatomi- cal eyes painted on the body. Some figures pre- serve indications of jewelry, such as necklaces, bracelets, and perhaps diadems.4" 32 On the amorphous character of this large group and the problem of typological hybrids, Sherratt 2000, 126. 13 Getz-Preziosi 1987, 102; Getz-Gentle 2001, 84-93 for the basic features of the Goulandris sculptor's works.

H6ckmann (1977, 40) indicates that some corpses were trussed. Fountou- lakis (1987, 29-32) notes marks on bones from EBA Manika suggestive of cutting muscles and tendons. It has also been proposed that some figures may have been consciously broken at neck and knee before placement in the grave.

In Early Cycladic I, the Plastiras figures have fin- gertips just meeting over the abdomen below the breasts, while the Louros figures have only stumps for arms. In the Early Cycladic II, the canonical figure has arms folded over the body (almost always left above right), still placed high under the breasts (in fact recalling to me a posture taken when one is in abdominal pain or great emotional distress). This point was also made by numerous ministers in one of my lec- ture audiences. In some cases the arms are placed so high that they actually push up or almost cradle the breasts. It is interesting, then, that Ucko mentions Egyptian texts which state that holding the breasts was an accepted way to depict mourning. Ucko 1968, 418; Leclant 1951, 123-7.

Hendrix proposes such painting might be applied as part of finishing the figure, that is, by the sculptor or a close associate.41 On the other hand, many dec- orative features (especially stripes and dots) were painted in red. Some of these patterns show signs of hasty or repeated application, leading Hen- drix to propose that they may have been applied by unskilled hands during specific rituals.42 She further proposes that such motifs may have been removed during the use-life of the figure, while other motifs may have been repainted to refresh visibility and/or "powers."43 Other scholars have suggested that these pigments served apotropa- ic or magico-religious purposes44 and observe that tattooing or body painting was probably an im- portant part of Cycladic culture.45 Getz-Gentle re- marks on the frequent use of red coloring in fu- neral rituals from the Neolithic onward, while two Cycladic graves preserved blue pigment distrib- uted on the body and floor of the tomb during burial.46 Context Unfortunately, evidence about the figures' ar- chaeological contexts is limited. Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, their growing popularity on the art market resulted in the illicit removal of over 1,000 sculptures from the islands and, hence, caused the loss of original provenance. In addition, this popularity stimulated the production of forg- eries, making even authentication problematic.47 Perhaps 1,200 FAFs are currently known, yet only 145 of these derive from scientific excavation of graves.48 Of those that were excavated, nearly all were found in burials; recent archaeological work, however, has lent some support to a notion that fig- ures were also used in settlements. In addition, the breakage and repair of some statues found in graves has caused many to suggest that the figures were used prior to their deposition in graves.49 It is pos- sible, then, that the statues performed some func- tion in daily life before becoming part of a burial rite.50 (This may now be further supported by evi- dence of repainting found on some statues.) It has been proposed that female figures could be offered 41 Hendrix 2000, 151-2, 155. 42 Hendrix 2000, 152, 158-9. 4'An intriguing passage in the Agamemnon (11. 1327-9) describes paint that can be removed by a wet sponge.

Although Getz-Gentle had argued for their prima- ry, if not exclusive, funerary use (Getz-Preziosi 1985, 9), later she allowed a possibility of non-sepulchral use, while indicat- ing this was not yet demonstrated (Getz-Preziosi 1987, 26, 31). In her most recent work (Getz-Gentle 2001, 35-6, 137 ns. 68, 69), however, she believes that the figures were in use prior to burial, as do Broodbank (2000, 218,262-3) and Sherratt (2000, 126). 50 The issue of broken figures has generated much discus- sion, not only about whether this is evidence for use before burial. Indeed, partial figures are found offered in graves (Ren- frew 1977, 70; 1984, 25-6; 1991, 98; Getz-Preziosi 1987, 32) and also perhaps in cemeteries but outside graves (Renfrew 1991, 101, n. 16).

Figure Interpretation A plethora of explanations for the Cycladic fig- ures exists in the scholarly literature.53 It has been suggested that the figures were (1) similar to Egyp- tian ushabti figures;"54 (2) substitutes for human sac- rifice;55 (3) guides to the underworld;56 (4) protec- tive guardians;57 (5) images for ancestor worship;58 (6) depictions of heroes or nymphs;5" (7) deities or worshipers;"' (8) the Great Mother in her guise as a goddess overseeing birth and death;61 (9) it has even been suggested that they were simply toys.62 There have been trenchant criticisms of many of these hypotheses, primarily on the grounds that they do not fit the little we do know about Early Cycladic society and the figures themselves.63 That these sculptures were toys seems belied by the size and quality of the materials, the effort that went into their production,64 and the apparent lack of association with children's graves."65 Likewise, giv- en the village structure of Early Cycladic society it seems doubtful that its rituals included visual rep- resentations of nymphs, heroes, or guides to the other world.66 The Great Mother hypothesis has been challenged because many Cycladic figures are broken, fragmentary, and sometimes crushed be- neath other deposits, seemingly inappropriate treatment for a divinity. In addition, the figures do not have exaggerated breasts, a characteristic fre- quently associated with Great Mother representa- tions."67 Finally, identification of Cycladic figures as slaves for the afterlife or as apotropaic devices rais- es questions about why the figures appear in only some graves."' One could argue that only the wealthy were able to afford such help or protection, but ' Renfrew 1984, 26 (cites a lack of data and one possible association of figures with a "male" grave identified as such based on the presence of a dagger); Getz-Preziosi 1985, 10 (says there is no evidence either way); Hockmann 1977, 41- 3 (suggests found in both male and female graves); Barber 1984, 13 (lack of detailed information); Lambrinoudakis 1990, 101 (accompanied both male and females indiscriminately).

(Drawing by E. Hendrix) More recent discussions of the figures' possible uses and meanings have attempted to incorporate increasing evidence about Early Cycladic society as well as theoretical consideration of figure use and ethnographic parallels. For example, Renfrew claims the standardization of the Early Cycladic II FAF argues against use as an emblem of status or membership in a specific group, proposing instead that figure use must be seen in the context of "reli- gious belief and perhaps ritual."'0 Renfrew recon- structs a domestic or household cult in which fig- ures were used as votives, votaries, and (the largest figures as) cult images. Noting that prehistoric com- munities rarely place cult figures in graves, Ren- frew suggests this practice indicates a personal as- sociation with cult on the part of the buried indi- vidual, for instance, as priest or shaman. Further, Renfrew proposes painted details may originally have provided attributes with which to indicate iden- tity and use of individual figures.71 Barber emphasizes aspects of the figures that he believes are significant for their interpretation in- stead of proposing an overarching explanation of 69 It has been suggested that the schematic figures might be less expensive versions of the FAFs (Barber 1984, 11) or that figures may have been produced in perishable materials, e.g., wood. Barber 1984, 11; Getz-Preziosi 1987, 9-10, 31, 40- 1. It has also been suggested that the marble figures might be imitations of metal, i.e., silver figures.

For instance, he argues the stan- dardization of the FAF, the features chosen for em- phasis,72 production in durable materials perhaps by specialist craftsmen,73 the restricted chronologi- cal range (essentially late Early Cycladic I and Early Cycladic II), and their disappearance in Early Cy- cladic III all require explanation. By considering earlier and later figure use in the Aegean as well as anthropological evidence, Barber proposes that the figures were important to community ritual and probably represented deities as well as votaries. The unusual figure types (musicians, cup bearers, war- riors) represent participants in ritual, while the majority type (the FAF) emphasizes "the fundamen- tal role of women as the source of life and renewal in the community.""74 The figures could be used in rituals to mark important life-stages, at times of com- munity crisis, or at significant moments during the year. Upon the death of the individual who origi- nally dedicated a figure, it was placed in their grave, perhaps as a spirit figure. Like Barber, Sherratt focuses on specific aspects of the figures that are noteworthy.75 Puzzling over the folded arm gesture, she notes its similarity to a pose "instinctively adopted by mothers cradling their babies" wondering whether the gesture might be intended as a promise of future fertili- ty.76 The consistent white or pale color of the sculp- tural materials (primarily marble, but also shell, bone, ivory, and lead), she proposes, may indicate "an ideal of pale skin as a distinctive mark of fem- inine status.""77 She further observes a shift in em- phasis from steatopygia in Neolithic figures to the nubile form of slim, reclining figures with small breasts. Drawing together these observations, Sher- ratt interprets their function in the context of ex- ogamy where the acquisition of women from other islands (whether by exchange or force) was a part of elite male ideology.78 Broodbank, critiquing earlier interpretations of the figures, proposes "an association with the ac- quisition and movement of high status women (and less commonly, men) within and between the nec- essarily exogamous communities of the Cyclades."79 He further notes, "The range of tattooed motifs and hair arrangements attested . . . may indicate that the painted surface records crucial messages .. ."80o and the unusual size of a few figures is likely "an outcome of status-driven competitive emulation." Further, he speculates "some of the figures ... may represent individuals and have played a part in defining a person's identity or marked a stage in their life" noting that "a funeral would provide an opportunity to ... mourn for an adult or child whose death could easily spell the demise of an entire settlement. "81 CYCLADIC CULTURE The earliest permanent settlement of the Cycla- des began near the end of the Neolithic period when people (perhaps from the coast of Asia Mi- nor or mainland Greece) paddled to the islands."2 A harsh environment with limited fresh water or tillable soil, the primary resources were stone and metals scattered throughout the islands."3 Settle- ment was sparse,84 varying from a few villages in the Neolithic, to dispersed farmsteads in Early Cyclad- ic I, to dispersed farmsteads combined with a few villages in Early Cycladic II. Subsistence consisted of a mix of farming, sheep and goat herding, and some fishing.85 Formal cemeteries appear early in the Cyclades (already at the end of the Neolithic)8" and are one of the primary sources for information about Early Bronze Age Cycladic society.87 72 Barber (1984, 11) sees these as the sexually distinctive characteristics. Although many of the figures do have tiny breasts and engraved pubic triangles, other scholars consider the folded-arm gesture or the elongated neck and tilted head as more distinctive. 73 On the issue of specialist craftsmen in Early Cycladic metallurgy and obsidian work, Nakou 1995, 20; Carter 1994, 137-8. 74 Barber 1984, 14. 75 She consistently stresses parallels with Near Eastern, es- pecially Anatolian metal figures, e.g., likening the painted decoration of Cycladic figures to the metal attachments on Near Eastern statues.

In Early Cycladic II, these cists were often lined on three sides with stone slabs while the fourth side was made of a dry stonewall. The body lay on its side (often the right side) in a contracted fetal position, arms in front, hands up- turned; the head was sometimes placed on a stone pillow. Although single inhumation predominat- ed, occasionally multiple burials occurred within a tomb."88 When a second burial was made, the de- cayed remains of the earlier burial would be brushed aside, except for the skull, which was left in place."8 When multiple burials were made in a tomb, a second story might be added with the up- per level used for inhumation and the lower level serving as an ossuary. Grave goods were generally few and simple. An occasional wealthy grave, how- ever, contained a variety of objects, such as pottery vessels and so-called frying pans, bronze and obsid- ian weapons and tools, bone and stone jewelry, lead models of ships,"9 and marble vessels and figures. Some items appear to be daily-use objects (i.e., per- sonal possessions) while others may have been made specifically for the grave.9' There were stone offer- ing platforms with pottery on the tops of graves or within the cemeteries. The care taken with the ar- rangement of the body and offerings in the grave, the treatment of the skull in multiple burials,92 the probable offering of daily-use and specifically fu- nerary objects, and the presence of offering plat- forms in cemeteries suggest a ritual at the time of burial as well as the probability of ongoing atten- tion to the deceased.93 A substantial increase during Early Cycladic II in the quantity of metal and obsidian found in graves had previously been explained in terms of devel- oping technologies and economic change, thus, these offerings were viewed as wealth indicative of the status of emergent leaders.94 Recent analyses, however, note that the metal and obsidian found in graves appear limited to standardized types (espe- cially daggers and prismatic blades and cores)."9 In addition, although there is no evidence for restrict- ed access to the raw materials, it seems likely that access to production skills was controlled.99 The rise in the quantity of metal and obsidian in graves dur- ing Early Cycladic II, then, may not indicate that the technical "know how" or the absolute amount of metalwork or obsidian increased, but rather that emergent social groups appropriated production and symbolic use of these materials creating a "new depositional strategy [offering in graves] ... which marked membership."97 It has been proposed that "formalized entry into a corporate group, age-grade or status may have necessitated the acquisition or awarding of a standard weapon," such as a metal dagger,98 whereas the obsidian blades (perhaps serving as razors) may have been part of a toilet kit necessary for shaving, which might be associated with rites of passage.99 A similar argument might be made for the iconographic evidence of body modi- fication, the appearance of jewelry (especially dia- dems), and the use of marble figures.""' Although Renfrew had proposed Early Cycladic II culture reached the level of"chiefdoms,""" Brood- bank more recently argues for an essentially "egal- itarian" community."'2 In an egalitarian community, social roles, authority, and prestige would be per- sonal, achieved, and temporary. The term chief- dom, however, implies ascribed status and an office of a chief who coordinated social, political, and re- ligious functions within society.

Evidence of interest in body adorn- ment and modification, expansion of figure types and size, and the beginnings of craft specialization all suggest there is some form of social differentia- tion in Early Cycladic II society.'"3 Ritual We know very little about the rituals of the Cy- cladic islanders, and much of what we suppose has been extrapolated from the figures and other objects in the burials. So far, there are no known sites, buildings, or household settings specifical- ly for ritual activity, though Renfrew and H6ck- mann have both speculated on their existence.104 Other scholars, however, have questioned wheth- er Early Cycladic II culture would require special- ized locations for such activity, proposing, instead, that its rituals would emphasize the basic cosmic powers of creation and regeneration by celebrat- ing significant life transitions-birth, puberty, marriage, childbirth, death."'5 Goodison observes that Early Cycladic II symbolic display suggests an "animistic tradition," in which "Spirits or super- natural forces [could be] immanent in plants, an- imals, stones . . . and that these may be developed into a schema of ideas about the cycles of change in human life."'"6 More recently, Broodbank has proposed the sym- bolic display (including depictions of canoes, fish, stars or sun motifs, birds, and spirals interpreted as representations of waves) "can be read as sym- bols of the sea and are indicative of burgeoning maritime prowess." In some instances, he even pro- poses more specific interpretations. For example: "In the combination of a longboat or star with fe- male genitalia on the frying pans from Chalandri- ani ... it is not hard to discern an association be- tween raiding or long-range navigation and bio- logical reproduction or sexual gratification."'"' Sherratt also notes the association of female vul- vae, celestial motifs, and marine symbolism, likewise proposing an ideology linking the sea and sexuality. She further observes the similarity of this group of symbols to those of eastern deities, for instance the Levantine imagery of Astarte as maris stella; hence she posits the existence of a goddess to protect and guide seafarers as well as to provide sexual gratification.s08 All analyses of ritual and symbolic display and figure use among Early Cycladic II islanders must remain speculative. Additional sources of informa- tion, however, may help to assess the hypothesis that a small group of Early Cycladic II figures preserved with red-painted facial striations served as images of mourners. For instance, comparative evidence from Mediterranean cultures and ethnographical- ly documented groups, as well as theoretical con- structs can provide useful insights. COMPARATIVE EVIDENCE Theory Although theoretical constructs for the analysis and interpretation of figures found in burials might be pertinent (e.g., theories about the archaeology of death''" and mortuary analysis,"" figure use,"' the body and body adaptation,"' and the individu- al,"3 to name a few), their application seems im- practicable because of the severely limited evidence both about the burials themselves and the contexts of figure use in Early Cycladic II society. Marcus summarizes the problem: "a theoretical framework ... cannot be successfully applied to poorly collect- ed archaeological data . . . context is crucial to stud- ies of both ritual behavior and socially constructed gender roles, and context cannot be reconstructed from museum collections that lack good prove- nience.""ll4 It is to be hoped that future discoveries may improve this situation and that other scholars will then take up the work of applying these theo- ries to the Cycladic figures. 103 For a consideration of "incipient" and "emergent" social complexity in Cyprus, see Knapp 1993, 85-95; also, Manning 1993. 104 Renfrew 1984, 27-8; 1991, 50, 101, 186; Hockmann 1977, 37-9.

Further, the specific cultural circumstances of use and the cosmological views of the people using the figures will determine their meanings in individual cases."s Thus, ethno- graphic evidence may provide useful parameters with- in which to consider Cycladic figure use, even though a fuller understanding of this use will require more knowledge about their specific cultural contexts. Figure Use. Ucko and Talalay, in their work on Med- iterranean Neolithic figurines,"9 observed that the evidence for figurine use in ethnographically docu- mented societies indicates a wide array of purposes: ancestor images, surrogate chiefs, protective spirits or household deities, charms, hexes, fetishes, illus- trations to enliven storytelling, teaching devices dur- ing initiation rituals about sexual matters, marriage, value systems, in divination and curing rites, and as mourners.1'21 In many instances, the figurines are small, disposable, and made from perishable materi- als. Ancestor images, however, tend to be larger, some- times made in more durable materials, and generally receive more care and attention (both in production and preservation). Figurines are only rarely kept and buried with an individual.12' These exceptional cases provide the best parallels for Cycladic figures. In ethnographic examples of tomb use, figurines almost never represent deities and "[were] buried for specific and often practical purposes."'22 That is, the figurines found offered in or near graves were generally used by the deceased in puberty rites, were received as initiation gifts or as spirit figures, were intended to commemorate dead an- cestors,'23 or were representations of mourners.124 All of these possibilities are pertinent to the present discussion of Early Cycladic II FAFs. Body Decoration. Some ethnographic studies of figure use address the possible relationship be- tween figure and body decoration.125 In general, body marking is related to taboos, rituals, and be- liefs in a society (though primarily aesthetic func- tions have also been described). 6 While tattooing or cicatrization"7 tend to mark a permanent change in status resulting from completion of a rite, non- permanent markings such as body paint are more often used for special occasions or to indicate tran- sient states."28 Frequently, body decoration takes place in the context of rituals, especially those de- scribed in the anthropological literature as "rites of passage"-festivals to mark puberty and initia- tion into adulthood, marriage, childbirth, and death."'9 Women often become primary bearers of "5 Talalay 1993, 40 for discussion and references to this debate; Marcus 1998, 17-23; Ucko 1996, 301-2.

"119 Ucko and Talalay have proposed that specific kinds of evidence must be considered when interpreting figurines: (1) the figurines themselves; (2) the archaeological context of the figurines; (3) the socioeconomic matrix of the communi- ty producing and using the figurines; and (4) ethnographic parallels. They also emphasize that figurines frequently served more than one function within a society and even individual figurines could serve multiple purposes over the course of their use.

In ethnographically documented cultures, a triad of colors (white, red, and black) is most often used for body decoration. Although these colors symbolize specific ideas, their significance varies from culture to culture and even within a culture their meaning can vary from event to event. Brain 1979, 114; Thevoz 1984, 54; Turn- er 1967, 59-92; Gr6ning 1997, 114; Goody 1962, 58. For ex- ample, in many western cultures black is the color of mourn- ing, whereas in China and parts of Africa, white is the color of mourning. In the present context, the fact that ancestors are often considered white and initiates in the liminal phase of their rite are often dusted white is perhaps suggestive. Gron- ing 1997, 116. 129 Often these passages are also accompanied by trials or tests. In some cases these have been likened to a symbolic death and rebirth (Ebin 1979, 59, 62) or a symbolic return to the womb and rebirth (Haaland and Haaland 1996, 298). Van Gennep (1960) divided such rituals into three stages, separa- tion, marginality, and aggregation. Ebin 1979, 42.</page><page sequence="14">538 GAIL L. HOFFMAN [AJA 106 such marks as a result of their critical role in these life transitions. This seems especially true of nu- bile girls, who had marks added to the face, breasts, or belly in recognition of their future biological role.'3o Like the ethnographically known uses of fig- urines, then, body decoration serves a variety of purposes: marks to indicate tribal affiliation; status or age-grade within a group; identification marks to secure a place in the spirit world; cures for pain; protective signs; good luck and love charms; mech- anisms for preserving youth; and as signs of mourn- ing.13' Also, like figure use, the meaning or signifi- cance of body decoration must be determined with- in specific cultural contexts.'32 Examples are known of body decoration mimicked in patterns found on figurines.133 Most often this occurs on ancestor fig- ures where the figure's decorative patterns match those of the person represented, not necessarily with the intent of portraiture, but rather to memo- rialize the individual's social persona. Ancestor Ritual. In village societies, ritual served important roles in social integration. Especially if the organizational principle of the society was mem- bership in lineages or descent groups, ancestor rit- uals played a part in creating social cohesion."34 Worldwide, some agricultural groups, believing that the dead continue to affect the living, celebrate ancestor rituals.'35 Still, as a group, the dead are variously imagined. Some cultures consider ances- tors to be beneficent,'36 while others consider them essentially maleficent.37' Although conceptualiza- tion of the dead varies from culture to culture, they often belong to a "faceless" group possessing spe- cial political or juridical status within the commu- nity.'38 Because ancestors might continue to affect the living, they can be consulted or placated; how- ever, in order for the ancestors to respond, a tangi- ble object had to exist for them to inhabit.'"9 Such objects take a variety of forms, such as memorial tablets, stools, and standardized figure types that were often stylized with elongated necks and gen- eralized facial features.140 These tangible forms were regularly anointed with oil, egg, and blood before being brought to participate in important societal events, such as initiations, weddings, and funer- als.'4' In addition, ancestor figures might serve in juridical proceedings as guarantors of truth'42 or as evidence of continuous habitation supporting spe- cific land claims.'43 When not in use, these ritual objects were kept in a shrine or memorial, some- times with the remains of the deceased person with whom they were associated. Ethnographic comparison thus allows a number of useful observations. Figure use has been wide- spread and has served many purposes. Figures of- fered in or near graves tended to represent funeral participants, initiation gifts, or ancestors. Larger fig- ures in more permanent materials most often were ancestor figures. Ancestor figures were tended, specially decorated, and brought to participate in important rites of passage. Markings on ancestor figures generally related to the social persona (age- grade, marital status, social rank) of an individual, however, the figures themselves were often gener- ic in form.'44 When the importance of women's bio- logical role was emphasized by a community, wom- 130 Brain 1979, 50, 70; Rubin 1988, 16, 19. 13' Talalay 1993, 71; Brain 1979, 23 and the illustration on 25 depicting a North American Indian widow who paint- ed her face with four vertical lines below the eyes symboliz- ing tears.

Also, Gr6ning 1997, 81, 167. Although ancestor figures often indicate status by reproducing the actual markings of the deceased, stools used as ancestor memorials also marked an individual's social perso- na through iconographic details.

In all cases, specific figure uses, meanings, and forms of decoration were directly related to the cosmological ideas of a particular group. Archaeology of Figure Use Egypt. Archaeologically preserved decorated fig- ures found in tombs provide additional sources of comparative evidence. The earliest known exam- ple linking body markings and decorated figures placed in graves comes from Egypt. Amunet (a priestess of Hathor at Thebes during Dynasty XI, ca. 2160-1994 B.C.) was tattooed with a series of dots and dashes creating an abstract geometric pat- tern on her body. Closely related patterns appear on contemporary faience figures often labeled "brides of the dead."'45 These small figures were placed in the graves of both men and women ap- parently to arouse the dead to procreate themselves, hence permitting their rebirth into the afterlife.'46 This use underscores how intimately linked figure use is with a specific culture and its ideology. Oaxaca, Mexico. The Early and Formative period (1800-500 b.c., uncalibrated) Oaxaca figures stud- ied by Marcus are important because the precise contexts, down to the specific room within a build- ing, for all the excavated figures were recorded. Such full contextual information combined with an indigenous ethnographic record permit de- tailed interpretation of production, uses, and mean- ings. Marcus argues that, in the early village peri- od, men's and women's rituals differed and took place in distinct locations. Men's rituals involved bloodletting, the use of narcotic plants, and per- haps contact with remote ancestors; occurred in special "Men's Houses"; and probably were attend- ed only by initiates.'47 In contrast, women's rituals focused on water divination,148 healing, and con- sulting recently deceased ancestors; took place within the household; and were apparently attend- ed by all women.'49 Small terracotta figurines were made to facilitate communication with recent ancestors.'15 Although a few specially costumed male figurines'5' as well as animal figurines occurred, the majority of the fig- ures were simple standardized female types with highly generalized facial features,'52 occasionally a female figure was shown pregnant.'5" The only dis- tinctive attributes were a variety of detailed hairdos that Marcus links to indications of age-grade, mari- tal status, or rank.'54 Marcus explains the large num- ber of figures as well as their primary excavated con- texts (in residences, in burials, and arranged in scenes in households) as the result of their being created for each occasion.'55 After use, the figurines would be discarded, frequently broken or defaced (perhaps to prevent their reuse),'56 hence, their most frequent secondary contexts is in household middens.1'" Though Marcus provides no detailed explana- tion of burial use, she observes that multiple figu- rines appear in female graves and might represent either unused production buried with their owner for disposal or burial gifts offered by mourners.'15 These figure types and burial evidence in some ways mirror that in the Cyclades.'15" The predomi- 145 There were two other female mummies preserved with similar tattoos.

The eventual disappearance of figu- rines from the archaeological record, she proposes, would be explained by the rise of the Zapotec state in which the ances- tors of"uninfluential people" became less important in com- parison to the ancestors of nobility and royalty. These groups, then, coopted the use of ceramic sculptures, which were now made of craft-specialist quality. Marcus 1998, 21, 29.</page><page sequence="16">540 GAIL L. HOFFMAN [AJA 106 nant figure type is a standardized, apparently fe- male, form; a few pregnant figures exist. Male fig- ures are rare and belong to special, probably ritual, types. Figures appear in only a small percentage of the graves.160 Yet, graves containing any such offer- ings often contained multiple figures. As society became more complex, figure types expanded to include larger, more elaborate forms probably pro- duced by specialists.'161 Cyprus. Cyprus, geographically close to the Cy- clades, has an especially long and complex tradi- tion of human figural representations, including individual figures, groups or scenes with fig- ures,162 and vessels with figural attachments. Dur- ing the Neolithic, so-called stump figures predom- inate; in the Chalcolithic, cruciform figures are most common; while in the Early Bronze Age (roughly contemporary with the Cycladic FAFs) the most prevalent form is the plank figure.'16 Al- though in some instances the figures have good archaeological contexts allowing complex inter- pretations of function, 64 more often, especially in the case of the Early Bronze Age plank figures, they are unprovenanced.'65 The plank figures, mostly made in clay, are high- ly schematized forms with little indication of sex. However, their bodies and faces are often covered with incised patterns. Some scholars consider the facial markings as evidence of tattoos or body paint.'66 Though mainly unprovenanced, their one assured context is in burials.'"' These figures ap- pear in fewer than 10% of the known burials and have been viewed as valued possessions or special- ized grave goods.168 It has been suggested that shifts in Bronze Age figure types occur along with the emergence of complex society as indicated espe- cially by increases in metallurgy and exchange of prestige goods.' 69 Although there appear to be sim- ilarities between Cypriot and Cycladic figures (both are schematized forms with added skin markings, some are placed in graves, and figure types shift as evidence of specialized skills and prestige goods appear), the lack of good contextual information for the Cypriot figures limits their interpretive and comparative potential.'76 Greek Funerary Ritual Since the meaning of figures and their decora- tion will be specific to the culture in which they are used, it is appropriate to examine what is known about figure use in graves and body marking in Greek society. Further, since the argument present- ed here is that the vertical striations on some fig- ures represent marks of mourning, this practice in Greek culture must also be explored. While we have no written texts to tell us about the funeral ceremonies of 2,500 B.C.,1'7 we do know something about such practices from fifth-century B.C. Greek texts and visual arts.'72 At the funeral prothesis or wake, women of the family wailed and groaned a lament, the goos, while other mourners (sometimes professionals) sang a dirge, the thrinos, perhaps accompanied by a reed-pipe, the aulos."73 Associat- ed with the moaning and verbal anguish of the fam- 160 In the Cyclades an estimate of 10% of the graves con- tained figures.

'71 Although one can debate whether Bronze Age Cycladic culture is linked to later developments in Greece, during the Early Bronze Age at least it is culturally most closely tied to mainland Greece and Crete. 172 On fifth-century funerary practices: Shapiro 1991; Gar- land 1985; Kurtz 1984; Sourvinou-Inwood 1981; Humphreys 1980; Vermeule 1979; Alexiou 1974; Kurtz and Boardman 1971; Andronikos 1968; Boardman 1955; Reiner 1938; Zschi- etzschmann 1928. The question of whether Early Cycladic culture can be considered a precursor to later Greek culture is difficult. Recent work on Late Bronze Age ritual areas in the Cyclades (especially at Kea and Phylakopi) has proposed links between Early Bronze Age and Late Bronze Age Cycladic cul- ture. Also, the extent to which Greek tragedy reflects actual burial ritual is debatable, e.g., Foley 1993. 173The wailing, groaning, termed g60os, describes the out- bursts of the kin while the threnos, a sort of sung dirge was performed by professional mourners. On the distinction be- tween g6os and threnos (largely lost by the Classical period) see Alexiou 1974, 11-3.

The practice of facial laceration is de- scribed in sources from Homer on. In the fifth cen- tury B.C., Aeschylus's Choephoroi provides an arrest- ing description of this action when the chorus, com- posed of mourning women, first speaks: "I came in haste out of the house to carry libations, hurt by the hard stroke of hands. My cheek shows bright ripped in the bloody furrows of nails gashing the skin."""75 Many other passages describe this practice,"76 and there are also recorded attempts to limit such dis- play at funerals (most notable are the reforms attrib- uted to Solon).'Y Although facial laceration was prac- ticed by women in fifth-century Greece, this is a long way from the third millennium B.C., when the Cycla- dic figures were made. Also, the practice of lacerat- ing the cheeks as part of the funeral is different than placing figures painted to represent mourners in graves. Archaeological evidence exists, however, for mourning figures with painted facial striations de- posited in graves fairly continuously from at least the Late Bronze Age to the fifth century (see below). It should also be remarked that funerary customs, es- pecially in regard to expressions of grief, are both especially conservative and widespread, encompass- ing disparate cultures and times. For example, Al- exiou has documented a close resemblance of fifth- century B.C. Greek funeral laments in the laments of women in rural villages of Greece today (some 2,500 years later), even though these laments are used in different religious contexts.'" What is strik- ing is that while their context of use is different, the modes for expressing grief have survived nearly un- changed for two and a half millennia. Likewise, lac- eration of the face has a long history and is wide- spread among cultures in the Mediterranean and beyond. There are repeated references to attempts to discourage or outlaw this practice, beginning in the Archaic period and continuing through the Byz- antine era."'7 If the lament and laceration character- istic of fifth-century B.C. mourning practice can be sustained for 2,500 years, might not the practice al- ready have been two millennia old in Aeschylus's day? In the visual arts, the tradition of representing the prothesis, mourners, and facial laceration is equal- ly long. Vermeule has noted, "The unbroken conti- nuity of funeral imagery . . . between the Bronze Age and the classical world is very clear in the artis- tic documents ... surviving all the cultural and eco- nomic vicissitudes of the Dark Age as the most sta- ble tradition in art, save scenes of war."'80 174 On laceration, Vermeule 1979, 14, n. 26 (where she notes these customs in Egypt, the Levant, and the Mycenae- an world); 1991; Alexiou 1974, 6; Sourvinou-Inwood 1983, 47; Cavanagh and Mee 1995, 58; van Wees 1998. Although facial laceration is vividly described in literature, is sometimes ren- dered in art, and must surely have been arresting in actual practice, surprisingly little comment in later scholarship is made about this practice beyond its existence. Sourvinou-Inwood (1983, 38) suggest that the "self-wounding... expresses a symbolic, partial identification with the deceased." Aristotle (fr. 101 Rose, ap. Athen. 675a) apparently suggested a similar in- terpretation, that is, it is in homeopathy with the dead that mourners disfigure and defile themselves.

"And saying these words, she scratched her face with her nails and beat her breast." (Tischendorf, 283) from Alexiou 1974, 68. The practice continues in modern Greece (ibid., 41).

HOFFMAN [AJA 106 Indeed, one of the first human representations in art following the Dark Age is a mourning wom- an.181 In the Geometric period, huge ceramic ves- sels serving as aristocratic tombstones carry depic- tions of the funeral prothesis, including mourning women.182 In the Late Bronze Age, terracotta sar- cophagi have scenes of mourning painted on their sides, the most famous series being the Tanagra larnakes.183 One of these coffins, now in Kassel, depicts mourners with hands to head and blood- ied cheeks (fig. 9).184 While facial laceration is ar- resting in its verbal description and probably even more so when actually seen in practice (fig. 10), its depiction does not transfer well to small-scale rep- resentations (though it is often included). In such instances, a gesture of hand to head more easily signals mourning. Another intriguing scene on a Tanagra sarcophagus depicts a person carrying a figure in a funeral context (fig. 11).185 This is the only preserved evidence that I know to indicate that figures might actually have been carried and dis- played during a funeral. Vermeule, however, has proposed that a Bronze Age head-rhyton of un- known provenance, with painted vertical gashes on its face, might also have been used as part of a fu- neral ceremony.186 This visual material provides additional evidence about funeral participants and activities, including the fact that standing and seat- ed mourners attended, as did warriors and musi- cians (both aulos and lyre-players). In addition, sac- rifice and libation were likely part of the rituals performed. Mourning Figures Placed in Graves.

The intriguing rhyton depicts a dead person (identified by the closed eyes with a painted pattern resembling stitches) with vertical red lines on each cheek. Often considered male because of a painted chin band interpreted as a beard, it is unusual to find male figures with laceration marks and I wonder if the band on the chin might render the cloth tie often used to keep the mouth of a dead person closed. It is also interesting that this rhyton pro- vides evidence that a dead person might carry marks ofmourn- ing. In this regard a Hellenistic epigram describing a woman who died in the birth of twins along with one of the babies is provocative. Upon reaching Hades, the dead woman tears her cheeks.

(AFPphoto/David Brauchli, with permission from Agence France-Presse) Late Bronze Age down to the fifth century B.C. Small sixth-century B.C. terracotta figures (both freestand- ing and attached to vessels) displaying a mourning gesture of hands raised to the head have been ex- cavated in graves from such sites as Arkades in Crete, Thera in the Cyclades, and the Kerameikos in Ath- ens. Although these figures are identified as mourn- ers above all by their gesture (hands raised to head, presumably tearing their hair), some also have paint- ed laceration marks on their faces (cheeks and fore- head)."'87 In the seventh century B.C., an interest- ing variation appears with the placement in graves of terracotta and painted scenes of figures frozen at the moment of scratching their cheeks.'88 In the Late Geometric period (ca. 750 B.C.), small terra- cotta mourning figures come from graves at Vrokas- tro in Crete and the Kerameikos. Again, some of the figures have their "hands on the head and blood running down the scratched cheeks and fore- head as indicated by red paint."'189 Stretching back even earlier, during the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1500 B.C.), terracotta mourning figures (identified by the gesture of hand raised to head) are also offered in graves from Perati in Attica, Rhodes, and Nax- os.190 They include both freestanding figures and figures designed for attachment to the rim of a bowl.

Tanagra sarcophagus with person carrying a figurine (after BCH [1975] 644, fig. 118) and detail of person carrying figurine. (After Immerwahr 1998, fig. 7.5b) While these sculpted mourning figures are found offered in graves, it would be misleading to suggest that they are common. In fact, they are quite rare (perhaps comparable in rarity to the FAFs in Early Cycladic II graves). As a group these terracotta fig- ures document a practice of offering sculpted fe- male mourning figures in graves.19' Other figure types are also offered in graves; most are female and some, such as the phi and psi figures, are known from settlement and sanctuary sites as well.192 Not all Late Bronze Age or Geometric figures deposit- ed in graves represent mourners, thus suggesting that the deposition of figures can have a variety of meanings, including the representation of mourn- ing women. Even earlier, in the Neolithic, figure uses seem equally varied, though in Greece, it is uncommon for Neolithic figures to be deposited in graves. However, one intriguing instance of Neolithic fig- ures (dating to ca. 3500 B.C.) associated with buri- als comes from the Cyclades. At Kephala on the island of Kea, seven of eight terracotta figures dis- covered derived from the area of the cemetery.'93 Coleman published the excavation results, specu- lating that "they [were] used in funerary ceremo- nies," though none was definitely associated with a skeleton in the grave.'94 These are remarkable in a number of ways. First, the heads are roughly similar in shape and stylization to later Cycladic figures, with flattened triangular faces that slope backward and carry as their only sculpted detail a projecting knob-like nose. Second, this is a rare sepulchral use of Neolithic figures. Such a practice is essen- tially unknown in the Neolithic culture of the Greek mainland,'95 yet it becomes absolutely typical of lat- er Cycladic culture. Third, one of the figures was very large for the Neolithic, about 50 cm.196 Discussing Greek Neolithic figures, Talalay ob- serves that while Kephala is the only Neolithic site in southern Greece where figures appear associat- ed with burial, it is also the earliest example of a formal cemetery. Citing anthropological parallels, she notes that cemeteries can serve to "publicly identify . .. collective or corporate identity."'197 Since sedentary agriculturalists are tied to fixed resourc- es, when resources are scarce, competition for con- trol of them may result. In such struggles, establish- ing rights to territory is critical, and cemeteries serve to legitimize claims because they establish ances- tral precedents.'19 Ancestor rituals are also often important in such contexts as shown by ancestor figures offered in and around burials in other soci- eties-both ancient and modern.199 Further, ances- tor images are frequently large and lavish in con- trast to other figure types. So, I suggest that the Neolithic Kephala figures may signal the begin- ning of ancestor ritual in the Cyclades, that they are directly linked to Early Bronze Age developments 91 Roughly a millennium separates the LBA figures from the EC II FAFs. Some scholars, however, have made arguments linking EBA and LBA ritual practice in the Cyclades (Barber 1984, 13, 12).

CONCLUSIONS Drawing together the disparate comparative evi- dence for figure uses and meanings into a specific interpretation of the Early Cycladic FAF is not yet possible. Still, the available evidence suggests gen- eral parameters within which to consider Early Cy- cladic figure use. Given the frequency with which ancestor rituals occur worldwide in early village soci- eties and the more culturally immediate and sug- gestive evidence of the Kephala Neolithic figurines, I propose that the Early Cycladic II FAFs were part of ancestor rituals practiced by Cycladic islanders. One purpose of such rituals would be to integrate various island groups that would need to maintain ties for exogamy.200 Another purpose could be to allow lin- eages or other groups to stake claims to territory, es- pecially necessary in marginal agricultural land or where inheritance rights for land were important."0' The generalized and standardized form of the FAF seems in keeping with a common conceptualization of the ancestors as faceless and belonging to a dis- tinct category of being. Indeed, when other cultures produced ancestor figures they were often highly styl- ized with elongated necks and generalized faces. When the sex is clearly indicated, it is nearly always female, though the tiny breasts and slim profile of the figure might suggest a nubile form. The prepon- derance of female figures may imply that women in Cycladic society were the primary bearers of ritual markings. The large size and more permanent mate- rials, as well as their use in some burials, also appears in keeping with what is known about ancestor fig- ures. The painted markings, then, are likely indica- tive of the social persona of the individual ancestor and of the ritual in which the figure participates. I wonder whether it is possible that some of these figures would have been produced at puberty. The figure, then, might have been used in various rites of passage. At such events, the figure and its owner would both receive appropriate decoration. Larger figures would be made for wealthier individuals, and a number of figures might be acquired over a life- time. Although during Early Cycladic II the most prevalent figure type is the FAF, schematic or violin- shaped figures probably continued to be made and might represent a less expensive version.202 In addi- tion, during Early Cycladic II, other types of figures, especially warriors and musicians, occur. These fig- ures might be associated with male social personae, as has also been suggested by recent consideration of daggers and obsidian blades from graves. The in- crease in size and quality of the primary figure type as well as the proliferation of other figure types seems in keeping with developments observed in other cases and associated with a rise in social complexity. Still, the vast majority of the canonical Cycladic fig- ures are female and probably reflect an important ritual role for women in Cycladic culture,203 while the presence of figures painted as mourners may point to a preeminent role for women in funerary ritual (a role similar to that which women played and continued to play in Greek funerals). Women at all periods in Greek culture carried primary responsi- bility for mourning at funerals (as well as for washing and preparation of the corpse).204 At death figures could be placed in the grave. The markings on the figure, then, might reflect something about status at death. For instance, an unmarried individual might be dressed in wedding attire and an FAF might receive similar decoration, much in the way that in later Greece, "women who were unmarried or recently married at death would be decked out on the bier as brides, often wearing crowns."205 Indeed, in the Archaic period, a large female statue dressed as a bride was placed as a marker over the grave of an aristocratic woman (Phrasikleia) who died unmarried.206 Painted dia- 200 Sherratt 2000, 136 n. 35 notes the uncharacteristic ex- istence of formal ties of epigamia or mutual concession of cit- izenship by right of marriage that existed between Cycladic islands in the seventh century B.C. Broodbank 1992, 543 pro- poses associating the figures "with the acquisition and move- ment of high status women ... within and between the tiny, necessarily exogamous communities of the Cyclades." 201Kenna (1976) indicates that still today in the Cyclades the person with responsibilities for tending a grave is the indi- vidual who inherited land rights. Ahern 1973 argues this for ancestor cults in the Far East, also, Fortes 1976, 9. 202 Scholars have proposed both that the FAF and schemat- ic figure types served basically the same purpose (Barber 1984, 11) and that the figure types should be understood as essen- tially different in function (Sherratt 2000, 128). 203 Doumas 1968, 93. 204 E.g., in the Iliad, where it is so important to have women for this role that foreign women (Briseis and other captives) mourn at Patroklos's death (II. 19.244-309).

HOFFMAN [AJA 106 dems have been observed on some FAFs, and sil- ver diadems (thought to be purely for funerary use) have been found in Cycladic graves. Could the inclusion of crowns on the figures and dia- dems offered in the graves also indicate that the deceased was unmarried? Certainly, as Broodbank has observed, the loss of a high status woman prior to marriage and childbirth would be an occasion of great lamentation for a society as close to the margins as was Early Cycladic society."' A woman dying during pregnancy or childbirth might re- ceive a pregnant figure offered in her grave."28 If it is true that larger figures were made for higher status individuals, it is intriguing that the red painted facial striations seem to occur dispropor- tionately on this group. (Four of the five preserved statues with painted facial striations were over 70 cm.) The death of a high status person might oc- casion great public grief. Hence, symbols and signs associated with mourning might be more pro- nounced. The marks of mourning, then, would be added to the figure as well as perhaps to the corpse; while participants in the funeral might actually lacerate their faces. Many questions remain unanswered, but with- out fuller contextual evidence for the figures and better excavation of settlements there is little hope of answering them. Still, it is possible to inch for- ward by studying carefully the evidence of paint traces preserved on the figures. (For instance, could the nonanatomical eyes be intended as pro- tective signs; that is, to ward off the evil eye? Are the zigzag patterns perhaps related to fertility as has been suggested for Egyptian figurines?) Giv- en that in most recorded instances, figures served multiple functions within a culture relating to its social structure and cosmological views, it might also prove useful to consider other symbolic evi- dence from the Early Cyclades (e.g., anthropomor- phic and zoomorphic vessels, and painted and incised decorations on pottery, including frying pans). With judicious use of ethnographic evi- dence and, where feasible, theoretical constructs about figure use, we may be able to expand our understanding of these figures' uses and mean- ings within Cycladic society.
