<plain_text><page sequence="1">LOGOS AND SHEKINAH IN THE FOURTH GOSPEL By R. D. MIDDLETON St. Augustine's College, Canterbury, England PHILO AND HIS THEOLOGICAL CONCEPTIONS IT SEEMS convenient to place Philo first in this examina- tion of possible sources of the doctrine of the Logos in the Fourth Gospel, because of his undisputed importance, and of the prominence which has so often been given to him in this connection. Philo's position as to the transcendence or immanence of God is puzzling because of its inconsistency. He never seems quite able to make up his mind. The explanation is to be found in the fact that he is half Greek and half Jewish and therefore is constantly being pulled two ways. Philo was a Jewish thinker, and therefore a pupil of the Rabbis, with a Greek education, and therefore a disciple of Plato. In his Platonic mood he thinks of God as having no personal existence in time or space, unrelated to the created uni- verse: "God has given nothing to Himself, for He has no need of anything; but He has given the world to the world, and its parts he has bestowed on themselves and on one another, and also on the universe. Not because He judged anything to be worthy of grace did He give in abundance to the universe and its parts, but looking to His own ever- lasting goodness, and thinking the doing good to be a line of conduct suitable to His own happy and blessed nature. So that if anyone were to ask me what was the cause of the creation of the world, having learnt from Moses, I should answer, that the goodness of the living God, being 101</page><page sequence="2">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the most important of His graces, is in itself the cause." (On the Unchangeableness of God, xxiii). In his Jewish fervor he is definitely conscious of the fatherhood of God, God in the intimacy of His relations to His people and His uni- verse: "God takes thought for the world. In that the Creator should ever take care for the thing made is required by the laws and ordinances of nature, and in accordance with these, parents take thought beforehand for their children. He that hearkens to these things rather with his understanding than his hearing and has stamped upon his soul the form of truths marvelous and much discussed that God is and has a Being. . . and that He ever takes thought for His creation, will lead a blessed happy life stamped with its doctrines of piety and holiness." (On the Creation, lxi). Philo apparently brought forward his theory of the Logos to bridge the gulf between these two extremes. But as he never quite definitely arrived at a personal or impersonal conception of God, so he is never clear in his conception of the Logos, or perhaps we should say his conception of the Logoi, which he introduces to explain the working of God in the world. The Creation is the work of the Logos: "The world perceived by the intellect is nothing else than the Word of God already in the act of creation." (On the Creation, vi). The Logos is the image of God: "For even if we are not yet fit to be called the Sons of God, yet we may be called the children of His eternal image, of His most sacred Logos; for the image of God is His most ancient Logos." (On the Confusion of Languages, xxviii). The Logoi are God's angels or messengers, ministering to the needs of men: "For God, not condescending to come down to the external senses, sends His own Logoi or angels for the sake of giving assistance to those who love virtue." (On Dreams, xii). The expression, "Let us make," 102</page><page sequence="3">LOGOS AND SHEKINAH IN FOURTH GOSPEL-MIDDLETON 103 in the narrative of creation indicates the presence of Logoi "others as fellow workers." The presence of the Logoi accounts for the existence of evil in man without attribut- ing it to God. "For it could not be that the Father should be the cause of evil to His offspring." (On the Creation, xxiv). Philo's conception of the Logos came no doubt partly from the Stoic teaching of Alexandria, partly of course from Holy Scripture with its frequent reference to the Word of God and its personification of Wisdom, and partly from the teaching of Judaism; but, according to Sethe the Egyptologist, there is yet another possible source. A copy of a theological treatise of about 3500 B.C.E. was made about 700 B.C.E. on a granite slab and set up in the temple of Ptah at Memphis. It is in the form of a religious drama such as those which were regularly performed in Egyptian temples on great festivals. It contains religious dogma for the new capital Memphis as contrasted with the old Helio- politan dogma dating from prehistoric times. This dogma assigns a remarkable role to heart and tongue in creation and in the view of Sethe, shared also by Breasted, becomes a possible source of the doctrine of the Logos. Dr. A. W. Blackman, from whose article in the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology these particulars have been obtained, sums up this conjecture as follows: "The inscription was probably still standing in its place and being read by learned priests even in the Ptolemaic period, and through them the ideas of the ancient Memphite priestly teachers may have found their way, in some form or other, into intellectual circles in Alexandria, where they would have undergone further modification," and "may, indirectly of course, have been responsible for the Logos doctrine of Philo."' ' Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. XVI, Parts III and IV, Nov. 1930, pp. 263-266.</page><page sequence="4">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW There are several "roles" of Philo's Logos which are very striking and indeed quite astonishing in their approach to Divinity. The Logos is spoken of as "High Priest," because like the High Priest he appears as the expiator of sins (On Fugitives, xx). He is "a suppliant to the immortal God" lKc7rs "on behalf of the mortal race which is exposed to affliction and misery" (Who is the Heir of Divine Things, xlii). He is described as "Paraclete" rapaKXqros and "Son of God." "For it was indispensable that the man who was consecrated to the Father of the world should have as a Paraclete, His Son, the Being most perfect in virtue to procure forgiveness of sins, and a supply of unlimited blessings." (Life of Moses, xiv). He is also "the Image of God": "for the image of God is his most ancient Logos." (The Confusion of Languages, xxviii). The not infrequent parallels in the Midrashim to many of Philo's conceptions need not detain us here. They do necessarily, in the words of Dr. J. Abelson, "stamp either as the borrower from the other."2 It would appear that Philo's Logos is to be regarded as a philosophical term employed by him to describe the personal dealings of God with man or with the universe. It has a definite theological significance. It cannot, how- ever, be imagined that he really thought of the Logos or Logoi as being endowed with personality in the sense in which we understand it, much less with Divinity, though his rather extravagant expressions at times seem to suggest the former, and do not go far from an approach to the latter. 2 J. Abelson, The Immanence of God in Rabbinical Literature, 1912, p. 68. 104</page><page sequence="5">LOGOS AND SHEKINAH IN FOURTH GOSPEL-MIDDLETON 105 THE PERSONIFICATION OF WISDOM IN PROVERBS AND THE APOCRYPHA In what is generally considered as the earliest portion of the book of Proverbs, chapter 10 onwards, Wisdom is regarded in a purely abstract aspect. Parallels may be found for the collection of Proverbs contained in 22.17- 23.14 in "Teaching of Amen-em-Apt." It is not necessary to suppose the borrowing to be on the Hebrew side. Sir Wallis Budge thinks the similarity may be due to "some Asiatic influence which found its way into Egypt under the Middle Empire, or about the time of the rule of the Hyksos over Lower Egypt. The doctrines of the Ger Maa may have been in existence in Egypt when the Pyramids were built, and assuming that some of them are of Asiatic origin, they might well have been brought there by way of Heliopolis from Syria and Babylonia by caravan men... From time immemorial Heliopolis was a cosmopolitan city, and a central desert mart where merchants of all nation- alities exchanged not only material goods, but ideas and information."3 In chapters 1-10, the latest portion of the book probably dating from about the third century B.C.E., Wisdom is definitely personified, e. g., the book opens with the "Praise of Wisdom" as it has been called, 1.1-9, where wisdom is regarded as equivalent to the fear of THE LORD and the knowledge of God, cf. also 2.5. In chapter 8.22-31, she is represented as being called into existence from before creation, standing by the Eternal as a master workman and subsequently acting as the guide and instructor of men. "THE LORD formed me as the beginning of His way before 3 A. E. Wallis Budge, The Teaching of Amen-em-Apt, 1924, p. 103.</page><page sequence="6">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW His works of old. From the everlasting was I set up, from the beginning, before the earth was," etc. See also 9.1-6, etc. A quite distinct contribution was made by the book Ecclesiasticus, or the Wisdom of Ben Sira, dating from about the first quarter of the second century, in which Wisdom is identified with the Law, e.g., 15.1: "For he that feareth THE LORD doeth this and he that taketh hold of the Law findeth her." 19.20: "All wisdom is the fear of THE LORD, and in all wisdom the fulfilling of the Law." 21.11: "He that observeth the Law becometh the master of the intent thereof, and the fear of THE LORD is the consummation of Wisdom." 24.23 ff.: "All these things are the book of the covenant of God Most High, the Law which Moses commanded.. which filleth [men] with wisdom." The same chapter makes a distinct approach to the suggestion of Divine Immanence through Wisdom, v. 3 ff.: "I came forth from the mouth of the Most High, and as a mist I covered the earth. In the high places did I fix my abode, and my throne was in the pillar of cloud. Alone I compassed the circuit of heaven." Wisdom seeking a resting place like the Shekinah took up her abode among the chosen people and found her rest in Jerusalem in the Holy Tabernacle in Mount Zion (24.4 if.). "He that created me fixed my dwelling-place, and He said, In Jacob let thy dwelling-place be ... In the holy tabernacle I ministered before Him; moreover in Zion was I established." In the Wisdom of Solomon, a work of the first century B.C.E. (chapters i-x, perhaps not earlier than B.C.E. 50, chapters x-xix, before the middle of the first century), Wisdom is described as pervading and penetrating "all things by reason of her pureness" (7.24). "For she is a vapour of the power of God and a clear effluence of the 106</page><page sequence="7">LOGOS AND SHEKINAH IN FOURTH GOSPEL-MIDDLETON 107 Glory of the Almighty.. . a reflection from everlasting light and an unspotted mirror of the working of God, and the image of His goodness" (vv. 25 and 26). In the same book Wisdom is equated with "the holy spirit of God," cf. 1.5: "the holy spirit of discipline fleeth deceit ... for Wisdom is a spirit that loveth man," and 9.17: "who can know Thy counsel unless Thou give him wisdom, and send Thy holy spirit from on high?" In 9.1, 2, Wisdom is identified with the Word of God: "0 God of the fathers, and LORD of mercy, who madest all things by Thy word, and by Thy wisdom didst form man." It will of course be borne in mind that Ben Sira is Pales- tinian and that the Wisdom of Solomon is Alexandrian. MEMRA IN THE OLD TESTAMENT AND THE TARGUMS The Hebrew :ni dabar "word" as the word of God is used in the Old Testament to express a divine communica- tion in the form of a command, prophecy, warning or encouragement 394 times (Brown-Driver-Briggs, Hebrew Lexicon, p. 182b). Examples of this usage are as follows: Gen. 15.1. The word of THE LORD came unto Abram Dmn m ;,lmr-nln ;~rrl; II Sam. 7.4, to Nathan; I Kings 6.11, to Solomon; 13.20, to the old prophet; 17.8, to Elijah; Isa. 38.4, to Isaiah; Jer. 1.4, to Jeremiah; Hos. 1.1, to Hosea, etc. In Deut. In- dabar, 9.5, has a similar content in a different setting, "that he may establish the word which THE LORD sware unto thy fathers" D'p,r ly1i l'nm, m;nir' yt3 WnK N rn r-nK; and again Deut. 30.14, "the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart to do it." inrvy5 ::1a lps -, n I :n:n ' 1' :lrip-'n. The Hebrew Tn= dabar "word" is in all cases in the Targums, the free renderings employed in the Synagogues,</page><page sequence="8">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW rendered by the Aramaic mDns pitgam, KnDn pitgama. This will be seen in the examples given below: Old Testament Gen. 15.1. The word of THE LORD came unto Abram. Deut. 9.5. That he may establish the word which THE LORD sware unto thy fathers. Deut. 18.20. The prophet who shall presume to speak a word in My name. Hos. 1.1. The word of THE LORD which came unto Hosea. Targum (Onkelos) The word of Yahweh troan "'n came unto Abram.

Targum (Jonathan) The word of prophecy mnn ,;m3 from before THE LORD which came unto Hosea. It will be clearly seen from the above that the Targums use tDonD pitgama as the equivalent of the word of THE LORD ;71'-:71`l when it expresses a divine communication in the form of a command or revelation. We now pass to the consideration of the word qn"D' nvn memra; this is derived from the Aramaic nD admar, say, tell, command.

[Doubtless with reference to the Pillar of Fire. See 9.3: He who passeth over before thee-a consuming fire.] It must not be imagined from the above instances that the Targums avoid all anthropomorphisms and remove 110</page><page sequence="11">LOGOS AND SHEKINAH IN FOURTH GOSPEL-MIDDLETON 111 them from the Hebrew original. This is very far from being the case. The Targums are full of anthropomorphisms, the instances of which are too numerous for quotation. They are very apparent in. the early narratives of Genesis, e. g., the story of the Garden of Eden, chapter 2. (3) To express the activity of God in Creation: Old Testament Gen. 1.27. And God created the man in his own image. Deut. 33.27. Underneath are the everlasting arms. Isa. 45.12. I have made the earth and created man upon it. Ps. 33.6. By the word of THE LORD were the Heavens made. Targum (Jerusalem) And the memra of THE LORD '"- H-lD' created the man in his own image. Targum (Onkelos) By His memra nnmoa' the world was created. Targum (Ps. Jonathan) By My memra 'nnn3 have I made the earth. Targum (to the Psalms) By the milla of THE LORD "-I 143= were the Heavens made. Against Ps. 33.6 it has been objected by G. F. Moore that the Targum is late,4 but it is not unlikely that it has preserved an early interpretation. Moore also apparently dis- likes the employment as evidence in this connection of any other Targum than that of Onkelos. But as has been pointed out by Bacher,s Onkelos has undergone a thorough and systematic revision, and by G. H. Box, that for this 4 Harvard Theological Review, Vol. XV, p. 46. s Jewish Encyclopaedia, Vol. XII, p. 59.</page><page sequence="12">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW very reason the paraphrastic renderings of the Palestinian Targum are likely to approach much more nearly to the ancient Targum than the official and rather stereotyped Targum of Onkelos.6 Some of these renderings are of great interest and one is especially worthy of mention. The opening words of Genesis are given in the Targum of Onkelos as follows: "At first l'wp: THE Lord created the heaven and the earth," while the Targum of Jerusalem has "In Wisdom THE LORD created" (tqnn). (4) With the suggestion of Personification: Old Testament Targum (Onkelos) Gen. 6.6.

It is not of course for one moment to be imagined that when the memra was personified in Jewish religious thought as Wisdom had been personified in Proverbs that it was in- tended to convey the suggestion of a personal existence as apart from God. Rabbinical teachers were at pains to dem- onstrate at all costs the Unity of God, but they were also anxious to remove from the popular mind (and it is generally regarded that the Targums were primarily composed for the edification of the people) expressions which sounded too anthropomorphic, or at least to expound these expres- sions. It does not seem possible to regard with G. F. Moore the term memra as a mere buffer word devoid of all theo- logical content, a mere phenomenon of translation.7 Nor is there any real reason to divorce its connection from the Hebrew dabar 'rm. Memra is a specifically Aramaic word, "and as such was a popular term, intelligible to the people."8 Its popular character is doubtless sufficient to account for its being frequently employed in the Targums. THE SHEKINAH IN THE OLD TESTAMENT AND THE TARGUMS The Hebrews while regarding Heaven as God's dwelling place (I Kings 8.30,9 Ps. 2.410) yet conceived of Him as manifesting Himself here on earth. Canaan was in a peculiar sense a territory belonging to THE LORD which He would give to His faithful servants. (Gen. 12.7," J; 13.15,2 J; 7 Harvard Theological Review, Vol. XV, pp. 53, 54. 8 G. H. Box, JQR, Vol. XXIII, p. 113. 9 Hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling place. 'o He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh. "I The Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, "Unto thy seed will I give this land." "2 All the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever."</page><page sequence="14">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW 15.7,'3 J). Banishment from THE LORD'S land suggests to David the distressing thought that his present relation to THE LORD as a devout worshipper and servant will have to be abandoned (I Sam. 26.19I4). Naaman asks that he may carry away with him to Syria two mules burden of earth, the soil of THE LORD'S land, that on his return to his own country he may still retain the privilege on this small portion of sacrificing to the God to whom the land belongs.'s (II Kings 5.17). Moreover within this sacred territory there were particular places which might be regarded as habitations of the Deity. Such places had been the scenes of theophanies where THE LORD had once or more than once manifested Himself and would be likely to do so again. They were in consequence marked out as places where His people might offer to Him sacrifice and worship.'6 The Book of Genesis records theophanies at Mamre 13.18 (J), 18.1 f. (J E), Beerlahairoi 16.7 f. (J), Moriah 22.2 (E), Bethel 28.10 f. (J E), 35.1 (E), and Penuel 32.22 (J). The Book of the Covenant (E) Exodus 20.21 contains the injunction "An altar of earth thou shalt make unto Me, and shalt sacrifice thereon," together with the assurance that "in every place where I record My name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee." When His people are bidden to leave Yahweh's land Yahweh promises to go with them, Gen. 46.3-4 (E). He appears as "the angel of the Lord" to Moses in Horeb in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush ;rn lin tw-n=n~, Ex. 3.2 (E).

The Presence (Ex. 14.19) described as "the angel of God" (E) stood as it were on guard, between the Israelites and the Egyptians, giving light to the former and being a cloud of darkness to the latter (J).17 At the critical moment when the Egyptians pursued the Israelites over the narrow pas- sage in the Red Sea where the waters had been temporarily held back "THE LORD looked forth upon the host of the Egyptians in the column of fire and of cloud (pIY WKt mDy) and discomforted the host of the Egyptians" (Ex. 14.24, J). Several weeks ("in the third month") after the departure from Egypt on arrival at Mount Sinai, a special manifesta- tion is granted, when "THE LORD came down upon it in fire" wn min' l,y 'rT' (Ex. 19.18) "and the smoke thereof went up as the smoke of a furnace" (Ex. 19.18, probably J). Again a little later on, "the cloud covered the mount. And the glory of THE LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days and the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud" (Ex. 24.15-18a). This section which is probably from the hand of P makes the interesting addition, "Moses entered into the midst of the cloud," which seems to suggest some kind of com- munion with the Deity. When life in the wilderness became organized, a Taber- nacle plt, or Tent of Meeting, was erected, that these theophanies, according to the priestly writer, might be continuous, "And let them make Me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them" (Ex. 25.8, P), "where I will meet with you . . . there will I meet with the children of Israel and it shall be sanctified by My glory" (Ex. 29.42, 43, P). When the work was completed, the cloud, which seems to '7 This rather obscure verse seems to be composite, and its meaning in its present state seems to be as above.</page><page sequence="16">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW be regarded as enveloping the Divine Presence, "covered the tent of meeting," and "Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of THE LORD filled the tabernacle." (Ex. 40.34, 35, P). The cloud of THE LORD remained over the Tabernacle "And there was fire in it by night" (Ex. 40.38). According to an earlier tradition, that of E, the the- ophany took place on the occasions when Moses entered the tent of meeting and held communion with the Deity "When Moses entered into the Tent, the column of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the Tent, and He spake with Moses. And all the people saw the column of cloud stand at the door of the Tent: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man at his tent door. And THE LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend." (Ex. 33.9-11). The priestly writer, in picturing the cloud perpetually over the Tabernacle, adds that by its rest or movement it made plain to the Israelites where they should camp or when they should be again on the march (Ex. 40.36-37; Num. 9.17-23). The movements of the cloud were regarded as "the commandment of THE LORD." Reference has already been made to the sacred places of Canaan in the time of the patriarchs. It was natural that on the return from Egypt these ancient sanctuaries, and others like them, should be held in reverence, and sacrifices offered at them from time to time.'8 Samuel offered sacri- fice at Ramah (I Sam. 7.17, 9.12, 13). Solomon went to Gibeon "the great high place" to offer sacrifice (I Kings 3.4). There was an altar on Mount Carmel which Elijah I8 The people have a sacrifice today in the high place vnrn;, I Sam. 9.12. 116</page><page sequence="17">LOGOS AND SHEKINAH IN FOURTH GOSPEL-MIDDLETON 117 repaired and used for sacrifice (I Kings 18.30). In the time of the Judges there was also the sanctuary at Shiloh, which was regarded as of especial importance as the home of the ark. Yet there was no perpetual manifestation there of the Divine Presence, "the word of THE LORD was rare Ip' in those days and there was no open vision" ynm lltn 1' (I Sam. 3.1). When the young Samuel began his acceptable ministrations "THE LORD appeared again in Shiloh; for THE LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word THE Lord" (I Sam. 3.21). At these local sanctuaries there appears to have fre- quently been a mazzebah, pillar rnmn. Jacob erected a mazzebah at Bethel where THE LORD appeared to him, poured oil upon it and called it "the house of God" nl' ,n1i (Gen. 28.17, 18, 20-22). Jacob and Laban after their quarrel make a covenant with sacrifice (31.54) and sacrificial meal (v. 46), and either Jacob or Laban, probably the latter (3py, seems to be an incorrect gloss), set up a mazzebah (E) as a witness that the one will not defraud the other. It appears that the somewhat later narrative of J has introduced the "heap of stones," and with it the sug- gestion which may have been found in E, in reference to the mazzebah, that the heap was a habitation of THE LORD from which he would look out on the territory of Laban and the territory of Jacob. The compiler rather awkwardly couples the two together in verse 52, "this heap be a witness and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm." A later command forbade the erection of such mazzebot, which may have become the objects of superstition. "And thou shalt not set thee up a mazzebah which the Lord thy God hateth" (Deut. 16.22). "And thou shalt break in pieces their mazzebot" (Ex. 23.24, E).</page><page sequence="18">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW By a later order, too, the sacred places for THE LORD'S worship scattered throughout Canaan were to be replaced by one central sanctuary. "Ye shall surely destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree" (Deut. 12.2 f.). The pollution of Canaanite high places had evidently entered into THE LORD'S sanctuaries (I Kings 14.22-24, 15.11-12, 22.46; Hos. 4.8-14). Therefore they must be swept away "for thou art an holy people unto THE LORD thy God" (Deut. 7.6). According to II Kings 22 and 23, this sweeping reformation was carried out under Josiah after the dis- covery of the book Deuteronomy, and the Temple at Jerusalem became the accepted sanctuary at which alone sacrificial worship was permissible. Josiah's reform marks a definite advance toward a purer religious conception such as finds expression in the teaching of the eighth century prophets. The Temple from its foundation by Solomon had been regarded as the especial dwelling place of THE LORD, "I have hallowed this house which thou has built, to put My name there for ever; and Mine eyes and Mine heart shall be there perpetually" (I Kings 9.3). "Here will I dwell for I have desired it" (Ps. 132.14), and the cloud which veiled the Presence in the wilderness was again to be found there, "And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of THE LORD, so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of THE LORD filled the house of THE LORD" (I Kings 8.10-11). This evidently belongs to an older narrative which has been incorporated into the book by the compiler, possibly with some expansion on his part. The view that heaven, not the Temple, is the 118</page><page sequence="19">LOGOS AND SHEKINAH IN FOURTH GOSPEL-MIDDLETON 119 abode of THE LORD is a product of exilic times. Its presence in Solomon's prayer of dedication "hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling place" (I Kings 8.30, 34, 36, 39, 45, 49) is probably the introduction of the compiler, to whom the prayer in its present form evidently belongs. It stands alongside of the emerging of a new and larger thought, that of the tran- scendence of God. "Is it indeed the case19 that God will dwell on the earth? Behold the heaven and the heaven of the heavens cannot contain Thee, how much less this house which I have builded" (v. 27). When the earthly temple lay in ruins, the prophet of the exile exclaims: "Thus saith THE LORD: The heaven is My throne, and the earth is the stool of My feet; what is this house ye will build Me and what is this place for My rest?" (Isa. 66.1). The psalmist of the exile has risen to the height of a definite and full belief in God's immanence: "Whither shall I go from Thy spirit or whither shall I flee from Thy Presence? If I ascend to Heaven Thou art there. If I make my bed in Sheol, lo, Thou art there. If I take the wings of the Dawn20 and dwell in the boundaries of the sea even there Thy hand shall lead me, and Thy right hand shall hold me." (Ps. 139.7-10). Ezekiel, who in his picture of a glorious future casts his mind over a somewhat idealized past, says, "doubtless according to a more heightened and spiritual concep- tion,"2" that when the newly constructed Temple and city are completed THE LORD will again honor them with His Presence "and the name of the city from that day shall be THE LORD is there" ,;W m;nrr m'n ny;-Dmvi (Ezek. 48.35).

Burney, Kings, p. 115.</page><page sequence="20">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW And what is of primary importance, THE LORD will pre- pare His people for this coming theophany by cleansing them from all defilement, giving them a new heart and a new spirit; He will indeed put His spirit within them, thus making His dwelling in the hearts of His people (Ezek. 36.23 ff.). "And I will put My spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and ye shall know that I THE LORD have spoken it, and performed it, saith THE LORD." (Ezek. 37.14). This teaching is in harmony with that of the Law of Holiness and of the priestly writer-THE LORD'S dwelling in the midst of His people, "And I will set My tabernacle among you: and My soul shall not abhor you. And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be My people" (Lev. 26.11-12, H). "And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God. And they shall know that I am THE LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am THE LORD their God." (Ex. 29.45-46, P). "And thou shalt not defile the land which ye inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell." (Num. 35.34, P). Rabbinical literature expresses this indwelling of the Deity by the noun Shekinah nrzv, a noun formed from the verb lpv, settle down, abide, dwell. It is used to paraphrase the verb Ip and in other ways to express the Divine Pres- ence, while at the same time avoiding direct mention of the personal activity of the Deity. In the Targums it occurs in the Aramaic form Shekinta (tnru'z). The senses in which the word is used may be conveniently grouped as follows: (1) God dwelling in the midst of His people, (2) God walking among His people or moving before them, (3) The withdrawal of God's Presence, (4) A substitute for the name of God. 120</page><page sequence="21">LOGOS AND SHEKINAH IN FOURTH GOSPEL-MIDDLETON 121 (1) God dwelling in the midst of His people: Old Testament Gen. 9.27. And may he dwell in the tents of Shem. Ex. 25.8. That I may dwell among them. Ex. 29.45. And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel. Targum (Onkelos) And he shall cause his Shekinta rnzmw to dwell in the tabernacles of Shem. And I will cause My Shekinta 'nriw to dwell among them. And I will cause My Shekinta 'nmw to dwell in the midst of the children of Israel. We may also classify under this heading the Deuter- onomic phrase "to cause his name to dwell there" (Deut. 12.11), which is rendered in the Targum, "to cause His Shekinta (mnn3w) to dwell there." This is also found in Deut. 14.23; 16.2, 6, 11; 26.2, etc., and a similar expression in I Kings 9.3, "to put My name there." (2) God walking among His people or moving before them: And THE LORD before him. Targum (Onkelos) And THE LORD caused His Shekinta nmziw to pass before him. Lev. 26.12. And I will walk And I will cause My Shekinta among you. 'mrnw to dwell among you. (3) The withdrawal of God's Presence: Deut. 31.17. I willhide My I will cause My Shekinta face.

And they are cut off from Thy hand. Isa. 57.17. I hid Myself. Hos. 5.6. He hath with- drawn Himself. Targum (to the Psalms) And Thou dost not cause Thy Shekinta -ln=w to dwell with our hosts. And they are separated from the face of Thy Shekinta 1 wru. Targum (Jonathan) I caused My Shekinta 'nmwU to go up from them. He hath caused His Shekinta nnmrv to go up. (4) A substitute for the name of THE LORD: Ex. 17.7. Is THE LORD amongst us or not? Ps. 16.8. I have set THE LORD before me continually. Because He is at my right hand I shall not be moved. Targum (Onkelos) Is the Shekinta of THE LORD 1" Hn1D 1 amongst us or not? Targum (to the Psalms) I have set THE LORD before me continually; because His Shekinta ,mrnw dwells upon me I shall not be moved. The word Shekinah is also freely used in rabbinical liter- ature outside the Targums in connections similar to those shown above. A few instances will suffice for our purpose: (1) The Presence with His people: Mishna, Abot 3.2: "But when two sit together and are busy with the words of the law the Shekinah is among them"; Hagigah 14b.1.6: "the 122</page><page sequence="23">LOGOS AND SHEKINAH IN FOURTH GOSPEL-MIDDLETON 123 Shekinah is with us"; Berakot 1.1: "He sought that the Shekinah should rest upon Israel, and He granted it." (2) The Presence moving with or for his people: Midrash Sifre on Numbers ?82: "The Shekinah went in advance of them thirty-six miles on that day, in order that they should enter the land." Ibid., ?84: "They went to Edom; and the Shekinah went with them." (3) The withdrawal of the Presence: Berakot 1.1, fol. 5b: "He causes the Shekinah to depart from Israel; as it is said, shall the Rock be removed out of its place? Rock means nothing else than the Holy One, blessed be He." (4) A substitute for the name of God: Hagigah 14a. 1.20: "How dost thou make the Shekinah a common thing?" Berakot 6.6: "He who walks with an erect carriage is as though he pushed against the feet of the Shekinah for it is written the whole earth is full of his glory." The same simile is used in a different connection in Hagigah 16a. 1.27. It will be seen by the above representative passages we have quoted from the Targums, that Shekinah does not indicate a Presence which takes the place of the Deity, but the Targums by the avoidance of the too frequent use of the divine name seek, in accordance with Jewish stand- ards of thinking, a more reverent way of writing or speaking of God. The same observation applies to its use in rab- binical literature outside the Targums. YEKARA IN THE OLD TESTAMENT AND THE TARGUMS Alongside of the conception of the manifestation of Divine Presence in the midst of His people grew, in course of time, that of the revelation of His glory. Doubtless the important figure of the Pillar of Cloud and still more the Pillar of Fire was meant to convey this impression. Moses (Ex. 33.18, E), holding communion with THE LORD, asks to see His "glory," (Kabod U:1:). 'lr'-nr m 'Rn'1, "Show</page><page sequence="24">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW me Thy glory." He is bidden to stand in a cleft of the rock covered by THE LORD'S hand while the Divine Glory passes by. The editor of the Books of Kings, representing the Deuteronomic view as to the necessity of a centraliza- tion of cultus, records that the ark was placed by the Priests in the newly erected Temple, and when the Priests had come out of the holy place the cloud filled the house of THE LORD, "so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory THE LORD m1r-71:= filled the house of THE LORD." (I Kings 8.11). The priestly writer, from his idealistic standpoint, pictures the mani- festation of THE LORD'S glory in the tabernacle in the wilderness, and traces it back to the theophany on Mount Sinai. He says that when the cloud indicating the Divine Presence had covered the Mount the glory of THE LORD mn'-ni:z "abode upon Mount Sinai." God is conceived as dwelling within the cloud, for he calls unto Moses "out of the midst of the cloud." "And the appearance of the glory of THE LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the Israelites" (Ex. 24.15-17). Moreover when Moses held communion with God in the Mount, his face shone so brilliantly that he was forced to veil it on his return to speak with men; doubtless this is to be understood as a reflection of "the glory of THE LORD." The priestly writer also records that when the command was given to erect the Tent of Meeting in the wilderness it was accompanied by the promise of THE LORD'S Presence in the Tent and a manifestation there of His glory "and there I will meet with the Israelites, and it shall be sanctified by My glory" (Ex. 29.43). He tells us that when the Tent was completed the cloud covered it and "the glory of THE LORD filled the Tabernacle." He says that the cloud, which became by its movements the signal to the Israelites to depart or remain, contained fire by night (Ex. 40.34-38). 124</page><page sequence="25">LOGOS AND SHEKINAH IN FOURTH GOSPEL-MIDDLETON 125 The same author in the Book of Numbers tells us that when the people with one voice condemned the report of the faithless spies "the glory of THE LORD appeared in the tent of meeting" in the sight of all the Israelites (Num. 14.10). It is surprising to find a little later on in the same chapter (verse 21) the appearance of a much more spiritual conception, almost approaching the doctrine of Divine Immanence, the earth shall be filled "with the glory of THE LORD." This may be from the older source E, or possibly it is a detached fragment which has been worked into the main narrative by the compiler. The same thought appears with a slight variation in Habakkuk 2.14, "the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of THE LORD as the waters cover the sea." Ps. 72.19 has "and let all the earth be filled with His glory" and Isa. 6.3 the curious phrase "the fulness of all the earth is His glory" 1-nm= rnw-b= thin. "The glory of THE LORD" is in I Sam. 4.22 almost identified with the ark, so closely associated in thought is this sacred symbol with the Divine Presence. When the ark falls into the hands of the Philistines "the glory is gone into exile from Israel" (Brown-Driver-Briggs, Lexicon, p. 163) bn'it' n ;rnn . Haggai promises that the Divine Presence will come again to the restored temple: "I will fill this house with glory, saith THE LORD of hosts." "The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, saith THE LORD of hosts." (Hag. 2.7, 9). Ezekiel sees in his vision of the river Chebar what looked like a bright rainbow: "This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of THE LORD," and he prostrates him- self before it (1.28). A second vision was granted to him "in the plain." "Behold the glory of THE LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on</page><page sequence="26">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW my face" (3.23). More striking still is the prophet's descrip- tion of the departure of the glory of THE LORD from the Temple which had been defiled with idolatrous rites. The glory of THE LORD, mounted on the cherubim, "went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city" (11.23).22 The word rnl is used occasionally in the Talmud to designate the visible accompaniment of the Divine Presence, but not with any frequency. Two instances will suffice: Hagigah 12b, 2, 33: "These are celestials and seraphs and holy beings and ministering angels, and the throne of glory, and the King, the Living God, high and lifted up, sitting above them among the clouds"; Midrash Sifre on Numbers: "The colour of the firmament is like unto the throne of the Divine Glory." (?115, The Law concerning Tassels). The equivalent of -nt: in the Targums is the Aramaic Yekara ip,, by which it is regularly translated. The word wNp' is also used in place of the direct use of the name THE LORD, particularly in such passages where God is repre- sented as having been seen by men which almost suggest as it were bodily form. The following instances will make this double usage plain: (a) As the equivalent of nzl "glory": Old Testament Targum (Onkelos) Ex. 24.17. And the appear- And the Yekara of THE ance of the glory of THE LORD was like devouring LORD was like devouring fire. fire. Ex. 29.43. And it shall be And it shall be sanctified sanctified by My glory. by My Yekara. 22 Later in his vision of the restored Temple, he sees the glory of Yahweh return and fill the house as of old (43.4, 5), "and behold the glory of THE LORD filled the house of Yahweh: and I fell upon my face" (44.4). 126</page><page sequence="27">LOGOS AND SHEKINAH IN FOURTH GOSPEL-MIDDLETON 127 Old Testament Num. 14.

And the Yekara of THE LORD went as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham. For he was afraid to look upon the manifestation of the Yekara of THE LORD. And they saw the Yekara of the God of Israel.</page><page sequence="28">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Occasionally Yekara and Shekinta are found together as in the following examples: Targum (Jonathan) Isa. 6.5. For mine eyes have seen the King, THE LORD of hosts. Isa. 40.22. He that sitteth upon the circle of the earth. Ps. 44.24 (25 Heb.) Where- fore hidest Thou Thy face. For mine eyes have seen the Yekara of the Shekinta of the King of the ages. That causeth the Shekinta of His Yekara to dwell in lofty strength. Targum (to the Psalms) Wherefore causest Thou the Shekinta of Thy Yekara to depart. It will be seen from the above that the word Yekara is used as an equivalent of the Hebrew word rnr: "glory" or to avoid the direct mention of the Divine Name and thus to suggest a higher conception of the manifestation of God as indicated by the splendor with which He is surrounded. THE PROLOGUE OF THE FOURTH GOSPEL It has been definitely stated that the Logos of the Fourth Gospel is derived from Philo, and as definitely that it repre- sents the targumic conception of the Word of THE LORD. It does not seem at all impossible that the teaching of Philo, a combination of the Stoic teaching of Alexandria, mingled with its teaching of Judaism in Scripture and Targum, perhaps with ideas current in the Egypt of a long past, may have reached the Fourth Evangelist. There are 128</page><page sequence="29">LOGOS AND SHEKINAH IN FOURTH GOSPEL-MIDDLETON 129 other parallels in the Fourth Gospel to Philo than that of the Logos, which it is outside the purpose of this paper to examine, but which readily will occur to the reader and which help to strengthen this presumption. The fact that the Evangelist owed a deep debt to the theological contri- butions of Judaism does not, in the view of the present writer, preclude the possibility of a debt also to Philo. As to the Fourth Evangelist's debt for his Logos con- ception to the Old Testament and to the Targums, the popular renderings of the Old Testament, there seems to the present writer no doubt at all. It must be remembered however that the memra of the Targums is not identical with the "word of THE LORD" of the Old Testament. Its meaning is bigger, its use is wider, and it is frequently found where the Old Testament makes no mention of the "word of THE LORD." But it can hardly be denied that the Old Testament contains the parent idea, and that it is right to trace the origin of the conception of the memra, to quote the late Dr. C. F. Burney, "to Old Testament passages in which the Hebrew m-r 'word' is employed in a connection which almost suggests hypostatization."23 Such a term as memra with its thought of God's creating and directing power "God in action," to quote the late Dr. G. H. Box,24 with its careful employment to ensure due reverence in the mention of the Divine Name, would be exactly what the Fourth Evangelist would need. This he takes, adding to it his own important contribution of Divine Personality to express the coming into the world of the Son of God. But the Logos does not stand alone in the Prologue. It is coupled in thought with the two other terms we have 23 The Aramaic Origin of the Fourth Gospel, p. 38. 24 JQR, Vol. XXIII, p. 110.</page><page sequence="30">TIIE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW been considering and terms well known to worshippers in the Synagogue. The Logos is said to "tabernacle" among his people like the Shekinah of old, Kal Xo6yos oap' yE7vero Kal EKrVfWo0rev &amp;v 7iltJv; the Shekinah is again seen amongst the Chosen People (cf. Apoc. 21.3, 'IJob X YK2v7 TOrV 0EOv /Herd Tr&amp; avOpC7rCowv, Kcal UKrIJvPEL PET' a1vrwv); and with this fresh theophany is the manifesta- tion of the "Glory of THE LORD" (Kabod '13n', Yekara inp'), which of old accompanied the revelation of the Divine Presence whether in Temple or Tent of Meeting, Kal eOearatueOa Trrv 6o 6av avrov, b6Sav cs Utovo-yevovs 7rapa 7rarp6s. Thus the three terms are used together to describe the mystery of the Incarnation.25 LOGOS, SHEKINAH AND YEKARA IN THE STRUCTURE AND THEOLOGY OF THE FOURTH GOSPEL It is the belief of the present writer that these conceptions of Logos or Memra, Shekinah and Yekara entered into the mind of the writer of the Fourth Gospel so completely that they recur again and again,26 in fact they seem to take their place in a regular cycle. Details cannot of course be pressed. It is not at the moment even seriously suggested that the Evangelist wrote with the intention of working out these conceptions, but the fact of their presence seems worthy of attention. The following table will show better than by any other method of explanation what is here meant. In the columns below, the Passion and Resurrection narratives are not included. 25 C. F.
