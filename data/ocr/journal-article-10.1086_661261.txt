Thus, the raised details of the  neck opening, the sleeves’ decoration (described be- low), the diagonal strap, and the icon on the headdress  were intended to be visible through the thin metal  sheet with which they were tightly covered, probably  similar to the above-mentioned gilded image of El  from Ugarit (fig. 8). The shimmering impression the  statue must originally have given accords well with the  radiant appearance attributed to ancient Near Eastern  deities. This is also the case with several other Le- vantine figurines, such as a flat, gilded statuette from  Megiddo (fig. 9).15 The statue’s pointed chin emphasizes the some- what triangular form of the face, which is small and  exhibits delicate features. These features, combined  with the lack of a beard, give a youthful impression.  Ebla to Damascus: Art and Archaeology of Ancient Syria (Washing- ton, D.C., 1985), 285–86, no. 132 (Aleppo 4529).

Garments and Accessories The Sandals The figure wears sandals with a single strap and a high  wedge heel (fig. 6). Bronze feet with similar footwear  from other statues were found in area A during the  renewed excavations of Hazor. Almost identical foot- wear was found on a left foot in the easternmost of the  small rooms north of the main hall of the monumental  building (Locus 705016) (fig. 10); the dimensions of  this specimen hint that the statue to which it originally  belonged was even larger than the one discussed here.  A smaller and rather worn right foot wearing a sandal  of the same type was revealed in the main hall (Locus  1713).17 Left and right feet of similar size, possibly a  pair, were uncovered in two separate loci in the two  small rooms north of the main hall; the left foot was  found near the northern bench (Locus 7176) in the  eastern room, while the right foot was unearthed on  the floor of the western room, where the statue dis- cussed here was found.18 Although the footwear of this  pair resembles the sandals of our statue in having a Figure 10—Left foot of a statue, Hazor, area A, monumental  single strap, it is closed along the sides like a shoe.

It  should be emphasized that cult images in the ancient  Near East, despite the often huge stature ascribed in  texts to the gods or goddesses that they represented,  were most probably—at least in the eye of the modern  beholder—of modest proportions.133 It is the combination of the dimensions of the statue,  its meticulous manufacture, and its original precious  metal coating that strongly supports the conclusion  that the Hazor statue served as a cult statue. To these  arguments I would add the figure’s enthroned stance,  which befits a focus of cultic veneration and was most  probably consciously selected for such a highly es- teemed artifact. As discussed above, the seated posture  is to be regarded as more exalted than the standing  one in the divine hierarchy, since it represents the de- ity in his most elevated form: peacefully enthroned as  a divine king in his abode after defeating his enemies.
