<plain_text><page sequence="1">ESSAIS DE G12OMORPHOLOGIE. By HENRI BAULIG. x and i6i pp.; diagrs. (Publs. Faculte des Lettres de l'Univ. de Strasbourg, No. II4.) Societe d'EJdition: Les Belles Lettres, Paris, ig50. 55o frs. 912 x 612 inches. This collection of essays is perhaps the most helpful book for geomorphologists that has ever been published. The author begins with an appreciation of Hutton and Playfair, the founders of the science, and then passes on to Davis, of whom he writes: "His reputation is universal." The essay on Davis, though appreciative throughout, never degenerates into adulation. It is constructive and critical and does not gloss over the imperfections of the master- his occasional serious errors ofjudgment and of hasty observation, adherence to certain preconceived ideas and some bias, notably a failure to appreciate the full significance of fluctuation of ocean level in the glacial period, and hence too great insistence on the initiation of geomorphic cycles by upheaval of the land. "It is a matter for regret that Davis had not re-examined the problem in the light of these new ideas, which, moreover, seem not yet to have crossed the Atlantic." Baulig also criticizes the failure of Davis' descriptive method when used by some of his followers-the danger, as it were, of placing the Davisian sharp tools in the hands of less expert workmen. In this essay Baulig lays his finger on the present plight of geomorphology, falling between the two stools of geology and geography. In America, in spite of Davis' efforts, geomorphology remains neglected by geographers and has returned to the geological fold; in Europe the indifference of geologists robs them of a valuable auxiliary, and the study and advancement of geomorphology have become "the appanage of geographers not always suitably prepared." The philosophy of the science is treated in the essay on "fundamental concepts." Among the fundamentals are the uniformitarian doctrine and the principle of least work, the latter supported by an apt quotation from Playfair. The author deprecates "finalism," and he is perhaps too severely critical of the anthropomorphism to be found in expres- sions such as a "search" by rivers for weak structures on which to flow. His preference is for a rather monotonous use of the verb "tend" (notion de tendance); but is anyone going to mistake an occasional metaphor, the only relief in an otherwise severe geomorphic description (a relief often indulged in by Davis), for such a lapse into anthropomorphic heresy? In this essay, as well as elsewhere in the book, emphasis is placed on the tendency of every ensemble of landforms toward conditions of equilibrium (though not a striving after this as toward a goal); for only such conditions are likely to be lasting (ont chance de durer). Most of the essays are reprints of articles dating from 1925 on, many in the Annales de Geographie, but they are supplemented by copious notes, which not only bring them up to date and clarify some small obscurities in the original versions but also provide a</page><page sequence="2">686 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW vehicle for the latest thoughts emanating from the author's active brain. For instance, the essay on the profile of equilibrium of rivers is reprinted from a paper published in 1925 that has become classic, but added matter extends the length to four times that of the original. Its value is greatly increased by the supplementary notes, in which theories of river grading recently offered by Kesseli, Mackin, Jovanovic, and Birot are discussed. There is an essay on the problem of convex and concave land slopes-their profile of equilibrium-first published in 1940, which includes a useful historical summary, an appreciation and application of the Davis-Gilbert creep explanation of convexity of hill- tops, and a criticism of the rainwash theory of Fenneman and Lawson. In the supple- mentary notes an answer is given to criticism of Baulig's theory published by Birot in I949. The essay on captures and diversions, first printed in I937, has not hitherto been easily accessible. The final essay is a reprint of the article on questions of terminology that was published in the Jotirnal of Geomorphology in I93 8. An English translation of this admirable book seems indispensable for students and workers in geomorphology; but in these days of high printing costs it is hopeless to ex- pect that such a venture will be undertaken by private enterprise. Perhaps some British or American society will issue it as a memoir.-C. A. COTTON</page></plain_text>
