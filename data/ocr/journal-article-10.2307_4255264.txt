Box 290, North Ryde, N.S.W. 2113, Australia. 1988. 236 pp. $49.95 (Aus- tralian). An upsurge in interest on wild food plants in Australia has been evident during the 1980's, with a marked increase in research papers, popular articles and books on the subject. While much of the information known to the indigenous Australian aboriginals has been lost, a concerted effort is now being made to document and present to both the scientific and general public the uses of native plants on the Australian continent. This book concentrates on plants of southeastern Australia between the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia and southern Queensland, a region where there are a number of historical records of past use and where the author has been able to make his own observations. Eleven chapters outline the habitats in which plants grow in Australia, food use, the danger of poisoning, aboriginal use, nutrient value, foraging and cooking, survival in the bush, and over 150 selected edible species. These selected species are briefly described, a distribution map is given for many and most are illustrated with excellent colour pho- tographs primarily by the author and T. J. Hawkeswood. A good colloquial account is given of the slow progression of interest in native food plants in Australia, covering the early European explorers, botanists and the aborigines. It is encouraging to read, a balanced review of the changing attitudes by European Australians to these plants, and also on the differing roles played by aboriginal adult males and females as too often the classical "male orientated view" of hunting (as opposed to gathering, the female role) is promoted. The book is mainly a review of past and present literature, although some new infor- mation is presented from the author's own experiments. Given that the book is aimed more at the amateur naturalist or people interested in alternative food supplies, it has a semi-popular approach and as a result suffers from some serious discrepancies in terms of teleology and anthropomorphism. Such phrases as "plants use animals to disperse their seeds," "plants protect their seeds with a hard coat," or, "to support these special wasps the trees may produce figs year-round" could have been easily avoided and do little to discourage such fanciful associations. The section on selected edible plants is also danger- ously misleading in parts, notably with regard to plant groups where some are edible and others are either poisonous or their potential unknown. Examples of these are in the pages on native grapes (Vitaceae) where comparative drawings are presented of taxa with edible fruits, whereas other morphologically similar taxa of unknown edibility are not included. In some instances where closely related taxa have poisonous/non-poisonous qualities, this is not mentioned, e.g., Macadamia integrifolia (Macadamia nut) and the poisonous M. ternifolia. The author's inability to come to terms with modern revisionary taxonomy is reflected in, "scientific names of many plants ... subject to changes, ... quest for posterity by self-indulgent biologists." These discrepancies apart, the book is very readable, the text is attractively presented, and this together with the excellent illustrations, make it one of the better volumes on the subject currently available.
