It is time that books featuring "bird art," which, in this country at least, has unhappily become segregated as a more or less (listinct subdivision of art, and at times been regarde(d by some misinformed critics as nothing more than a form of two-dimensional taxidermy, be forced to stand on their own merits, rather than upon the claims of various publishing houses motivated primarily by thoughts of cash profits. There has been a regrettable tendlency on the part of more than one publisher to announce each forthcoming work with such risk) super- latives as "the greatest, the most beautiful, the truest to nature," and so on. If any (qualifi- cation is made at all, it usually takes the form of "since Audubon," thus serving to perl)etuate the aNve which still largely paralyzes public thought in regard to the admittedly laudable, but far from superhuman, artistic efforts of the woodsman-artist. Perhaps a lew high in ballyhoo has been attained by Rinehart and Company in the advance publicity for "Mena- honi's Birds." "This is a collection," we are told, "of the most beautiful, most faithful bird l)ortraits painted in Anmerica in more than one hundred years. Not since Audubon's great Folio, have an) American bird pictures created as much excitement. Menaboni's birds in flight, his me- ticulous detail and realistic settings have surprised and excited the naturalists. Critics aln(i art connoisseurs, praising the unusual technique, the subtle shadings, and the radiant colors of the originals, call Athos Menaboni the greatest living portrait painter of bird life." Strong words! Beautiful some of the pictures may be, but it is a large order to live ul) to claims such as these; certainly opinions will vary widely. Possibly the statement about the excitement caused is true. If so, it is a testimonial to modern promotional methods. The naturalists have been surprised, there is no question; but "disturbed," rather than "excited," best (lescrib)es the reactions of those with whom I have discussed this book. As far as the "critics an(d art connoisseurs" vaguel) alluded to in the blurbs are concerned, they are no more (qualifie(d to elect the greatest living (or dead) portrait painter of bird life than would a Martian who had never seen a man be qualified to choose between Sargent, Al Capp, and Picasso as hluman portrait artists. In the first place, let us make it plain that we are here discussing what is sometimes calle(d aca(lemic art. That is, art which embodies a strong element of craft, and which re(uires no phony special genius or divinely-imparted mystic inspiration for its understanding. Those who invariably shout "bourgeois," or "mere illustration" in response to any timid request for truth in the painting of nature needl read no further. A l)ortrait is a likeness. We are told that Menaboni's paintings are l)ortraits of birds, an(d it seems fair, therefore, that they be so judged. A portrait of a person mav be painstakingly executed, the details of hair, skin, and clothing rendered with consummate skill, yet if the carriage is wrong, if the relationshins of the bones and features of the hea(d are wanting in accuracy, the portrait fails. The likeness is not there; the essential character is lacking. And who shall judge this success or failure? Surel) the acquaintances of the subject shoul(d have authority in the matter at least equal to those who have never seen him. Does it not follow that the evaluation of a bird portrait, at least as far as the likeness is concerned, is a l)rovince for the ornithologist as much as for the "art critic" whose experience with birds is limited to cursory glances at the pigeons of a Manhattan tower? Menaboni's paintings reveal a pleasing grasp of the essentials of (lesign an(d coml)osition, an(d an excellent feeling for, and use of, color. They are characterized by a surprisingly uniform 124</page><page sequence="2">June 1951 ORNITHOLOGICAL LITERATURE 125 vol. 63, No. 2 delicacy of treatment. The artist is good at painting feathers,-remarkably good, yet he has apparently fallen prey to a fascination with diffuse, reflected light, to the extent that, in his paintings the softly abundant plumage of a Great Horned Owl, the fluffy feathers of a kinglet, the iridescent ones of a grackle, and the coarse, boardlike feathers of an eagle all appear to have approximately the same texture. The same is true of his work with plants. Many of the small flowers, twigs, and tendrils are painted with grace and delicacy, but he misses completely the strength and mass and rugged textures of a great bole or stump. His greatest weakness is in structure. With all his painstaking study of plumages and feathers, his work shows an entirely inadequate grasp of the form, of the bony anatomy, of a bird. This is most evident in the larger species in which this anatomy is less conveniently cloaked in plumage, and results in a vague, disturbing superficiality which affects most of the plates. Particularly bad in this respect are his flying Cardinal (title page), Summer Tanagers, flying Marsh Hawk (resembling an old and poorly stuffed specimen with shiny new feathers), Golden Eagle, Sparrow Hawks, Pileated (consistently mis-spelled "piliated") Woodpeckers, Little Blue Herons, and Sharp-shinned Hawk. Faulty observation is revealed by the fact that many of the birds in flight have too many primaries and/or secondaries. This is painfully evident in the drawing of the flying Cardinal already mentioned above. Allowing the proper number of nine primaries, we find that this individual has eleven, rather than six, secondaries! No wonder this boneless wing looks peculiar. Menaboni has had difficulty with his perspective in places, being troubled by the admittedly trying task of making a wing go away from him (Belted Kingfisher, Great Horned Owl). The size relationship of the sexes is in error in his drawing of Boat-tailed Grackles. He fails miser- ably in catching the facial "expressions" so important in portraits, the treatment of hawks and eagles being particularly unsympathetic in this respect. Several of the plates, notwithstanding, are very good. I personally consider the Kentucky Warblers, Screech Owl, Ruby-crowned Kinglets, and Canada Geese well above the rest, and the half-tone of the two Black Skimmers is a masterpiece of decorative design. Menaboni is at his best with the small black and white vignettes scattered through the text. Many of these are extremely pleasing. It is difficult to account for the way in which the plates are captioned. The brief description accompanying each appears on the back of the plate, facing the next one. This feature max lead to considerable confusion among non-ornithological readers. The text by Sara Menaboni is a rambling, sometimes interesting, sometimes dull account of the Menabonis' life with hirds, featuring a great deal of reference to various pets, and small experiences with nature. It is a most difficult task to write such a commentary without be- coming at times trite and puerile, which pitfalls Mrs. Menaboni has not entirely avoided. Considerable anthropomorphism appears in the text, which seems to reveal the authors as sentimental amateur nature lovers rather than as scientists. The Menabonis are to be congratulated on their perseverance and their deep love of wild- life. Had the book been publicized as a sincere expression of this love, beautifully produced and expensively illustrated with attractive and decorative pictures (which it is), rather than as one of the most authoritative ornithological works of decades, with the most faithful bird portraits (which it is not), there would be little fault to find with it.-Robert M.
