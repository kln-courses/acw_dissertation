Suffice it to say that this information could not have been recovered because of teaching committments by other members of the Anthro- pology Department had not someone been available dur- ing the academic year for salvage archaeology. A second salvage operation was brought to our atten- tion by the membership of the Oklahoma Anthropologi- cal Society at Muskogee, Oklahoma, which is some 160 miles east of Oklahoma City near the Arkansas border. Here a recent industrial drive has brought several eastern firms into the area to build plants along the Arkansas River. Preliminary surveys on both properties in question showed sites which might be related in some way to the Hughes Mound nearby which had been previously exca- vated by the W.P.A. Negotiations were begun with both companies for excavation permits and, if possible, for financial support. Unfortunately, by the time the various officials in one of the companies had been contacted, plant construction was under way and investigation showed that the old village site had been scooped up by earth movers in leveling the plant site. In the other case it developed that the company was leasing the property from a government agency which was the actual owner. Several months of communication were required to obtain permission to excavate these sites prior to con- struction. The National Park Service was in this case able to support limited archaeological salvage work on the federal lands. Both of these cases demonstrate that sufficient time, at least several months, must be allowed for negotiations with large corporations or the federal government where salvage operations are contemplated, especially if jurisdiction is not in the state. These experiences in highway salvage archaeology are presented not as models, but as examples of some of the initial problems involved in establishing a salvage pro- gram under the Federal Highways Act in one state. Dur- ing the Central States Archaeological Conference at Urbana, Illinois, in October, 1956, it was pointed out that every state differs in highway programming procedures, since different political institutions control the highway and archaeological aspects and there are various areas of responsibility for the preservation of state antiquities. Consequently, it seems unlikely that a single nation-wide procedure can eventuate for highway salvage archae- ology. In fact, there appears to be some doubt as to whether in all states the pattern of highway location will coincide sufficiently with the prehistoric settlment pat- terns to justify a salvage program of the preceding type. To date it would seem that the effectiveness of the ar- chaeological salvage programs under the Federal High- ways Act will depend upon 3 factors: (1) centralization of the state's archaeological resources and responsibility for those resources in one institution and/or individual (this of course does not preclude delegation of that authority); (2) channeling federal highway programming and construction data for the salvage archaeologist through the local office of the Bureau of Public Roads; and (3) cooperation of the general type and to the extent which exists between the salvage archaeologist and the State Highway Department and the Bureau of Public Roads in Oklahoma. It will probably take some time to establish the worth of an archaeological highway salvage program in any given state. For while surface surveys may not at first develop much evidence, as in Oklahoma, later construc- tion may reveal subsurface evidence. The time between these first surveys and the construction date may be several years. The next 2 or 3 years will therefore be the test period for the nation-wide salvage program. JAMES B. SHAEFFER University of Oklahoma Norman, Okla. March, 1957 UNFIRED CLAY OBJECTS FROM WATERFALL RUIN, NORTHEASTERN ARIZONA Waterfall Ruin (N.A. 2676), a cave ruin in the Chin- lee Valley about 12 miles south of Poncho House, has been briefly described by Guernsey (1931: 32-6) and was the subject of further excavation by Peabody Museum parties led by Oliver La Farge in 1924 and by the senior author in 1933. A number of modeled clay objects ob- tained in 1933 are of interest as tending to bridge the gap between the Basketmaker III clay complex and certain later manifestations. The earliest structures at the site are Basketmaker III. The main occupation, characterized by continuous building and rebuilding, was in Pueblo I to early Pueblo II, the pottery being predominantly Dead- man's Black-on-red and Kana-a Gray and Black-on-white, with some Black Mesa Black-on-white and all-over corru- gated ware. Although a few later sherds occur and the stratification in which clay objects were encountered was in large part much disturbed, it is unlikely that any of them are later than the 10th century. Basketmaker III Figurines. Two small anthropomorphic figurines (not illustrated) were associated with the earli- est structures and can be confidently assigned to Basket- maker III on typological grounds. One is represented by the head and upper portion of the shoulder region, while the other is a female figurine complete except for the head. Both bear typical Basketmaker III punctate decora- tion. Babes and Cradles. The babe-in-cradle, Figure 1 a, came from fill in a storage bin which also contained Kana-a Black-on-white and sherds of all-over corrugated ware. The flat cradle, 31/8 by 5/8 by -36 inches, has a hood composed of a flat strip of clay protruding at right angles from the upper rim of the cradle to a height of /V inch. The lower ends of the hood curve in and serve to hold in place the readily removable babe, a flat, spatulate piece of clay 1-l6 inch in length. There is no indication that the babe was bonded or tied to the cradle. Lacking even the crude nose ridge characteristic of later examples in the area, the babe would hardly be recognizable as anthropomorphic if it had not been found with the cradle. Other similar specimens include 2 babes (1 81</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY b e a d c 1 g h i FIG. 1 [Byers and Morss].

(Not to scale.) shown in Fig. 1 b), 2 cradles, and a babe's head as well as several other crude or broken specimens which may be babes or cradles. The 2 cradles do not now have hoods (although they may have been present originally) and have blips of clay on the upper surfaces suggesting that the babe may have been lightly bonded to the cradle. Other Figurines. Two somewhat more elaborate an- thropomorphs are shown in Figure 1 c and d. The former, 21/4 inches long, has a nose ridge. Near the base is a small, conical depression. The latter, 33/4 inches long, is much thicker (3/4 inch) than the usual "babe" type and is coarsely modeled, with deep depressions for eyes and mouth. The eyes were charcoal inserts, of which a frag- ment remains in the left eye socket. The conical protru- sion in the abdomen of this specimen and the hole in that of the preceding specimen would seem, if one may judge from position on such crude figures, to be umbilical rather than genital. If this interpretation is correct, both are simply elaborations on the "babe" theme. Effigy Carrying Baskets. A small effigy carrying basket, 13/4 inch wide, has 2 holes in the back for the tump line (Fig. 1 g) and casual punctate decoration in front. The tip is broken off. It was found in worked-over fill but typologically seems close to such Basketmaker III speci- mens as that shown in Guernsey 1931, Fig. 26 a. The tiny (7/8 inch) bifurcated effigy basket with tump-line holes (Fig. 1 h) came from a fallen roof layer which also contained a Kana-a Black-on-white jar. At least 6 other effigy carrying baskets were found which are larger, averaging perhaps 5 inches in original length, and usually very crudely made. Of these, three were definitely bifur- cated (Fig. 1 e). Most have 2 or 4 sticks protruding from the interior or holes for such sticks (Fig. 1 e, i). The broken end of a thick, crude bifurcated effigy basket with 2 sticks protruding 41/2 inches at one side was found in fill between 2 floors which also yielded a cradle and 2 babes. The collection also includes sherds from several un- fired clay bowls and dishes as well as fragments of non- representational or now unidentifiable clay objects. Discussion: Morris and Burgh (1941: 54-6), and, more recently, Judd (1954: 306-20) see the previously utili- tarian Basketmaker carrying basket acquiring some cult or ceremonial significance in Basketmaker III times which carried over into the nonutilitarian Pueblo III bi- furcated basket. In Basketmaker III both carrying baskets and figurines were modeled in clay, an association which persists in the Fremont culture, probably as late as the 11th century. At Pueblo Bonito, with an 11th century terminal date, both the bifurcated basket and pottery models of it appear, with a very few figurines, and the actual bifurcated basket also turns up at later Pueblo III sites of the Kayenta area. Previously, however, only one actual carrying basket (not bifurcated) and no effigy baskets or figurines have been reported from the Anasazi area in Pueblo I times. At Waterfall Ruin the clay figurine and effigy carrying basket seem to have persisted from Basketmaker III into Pueblo II with the bifurcated effigy basket appearing at some time during this period. At Pueblo Bonito and Pueblo del Arroyo pottery models of bifurcated baskets usually had 4 pottery columns rising from the interior and either terminating in a pair of loop handles or supporting a miniature jar. To these columns the sticks in the crude clay baskets from Water- fall Ruin obviously correspond although no super- structure is preserved in any of the specimens. The babe-in-cradle with head confined by the incurv- ing cradle hood is found on Kayenta and Tusayan pot- tery handles, chiefly ladle handles, of the 12th to 14th centuries (Morss 1954: 41). Its occurrence at Waterfall Ruin 2 or 3 centuries earlier as a component of the un- baked clay object complex again bridges a gap in the evidence for a connection already postulated. However, there is no evidence in the Waterfall Ruin material of the multiple bindings across the body of the babe, so sug- gestive of Mesoamerican influence, which are found on most of the later examples. 82 [ XXIII, 1, 1957 Q '1</page><page sequence="3">FACTS AND COMMENTS GUERNSEY, S.

June, 1956 PROBABLE USE OF STONE PROJECTILE POINTS In recent years there have been some differences of opinion among archaeologists as to the probable use of artifacts shaped like arrowheads but larger than the small so-called "bird points" and ranging in length up to 4 or 5 inches. Some think they are too large and heavy for arrowpoints and must be either knives or spear points. In an attempt to throw some light on this question, tests were made using points varying in weight from that of the smallest "bird points" up to that of spear heads. Since it is evident that weight is the limiting factor in the use of arrowpoints, several stone points were first weighed. They were typical triangular points from 3 to 41/2 inches long, about 3/8 inch thick and from 1 to 13/4 inches wide. Most of them were of flint and a few were of quartzite. The lightest weighed 14.17 gm., the heaviest 40.28 gm. Unfeathered arrows were used in the test, as it was known, from previous experience, that unfeath- ered arrows fly sufficiently true for the killing of game, if the heads are moderately heavy, and it is also evident that if an arrow without feathers flies true, it will be still more accurate with feathers. Also in considering the probable development of the bow and arrow, it seems quite likely that the earliest arrows were not feathered. Even at the present day, there are some primitive tribes that do not feather their arrows. A mechanical testing machine was not used because of the expense and the difficulty of construction. However, the tests were made by an experienced archer who has shot in several state tournaments. Perhaps this makes the results somewhat subjective but, on the other hand, it is the way primitive man did it. The first test was with a 25-inch shaft of uniform size and material, weighing 19.5 gm. and with the end sharp- ened to a point. As was expected, its accuracy was very poor. With such a shaft, the center of gravity is half way between the nock and the head and, during the flight, there is as much air friction on the forward as on the rear end of the arrow. Next, the same shaft was pointed with a bullet jacket weighing 2.4 gm. This placed the center of gravity a little farther forward but the accuracy was still poor. The next head was an empty cartridge weighing 12.8 gm. This put the center of gravity at 171/2 inches from the nock. With a bow pulling 20 pounds it gave good accuracy up to 30 feet, fair accuracy up to 50 feet, and with a bow pulling 35 pounds it gave good ac- curacy to over 60 feet. Tests were then made using increasingly heavier heads. Accuracy continued to in- crease as the weight of the points was increased until the high trajectory began to interfere. Even with a point weighing 90 gm. it was possible, with a little practice, to shoot quite accurately up to 50 feet or more. It was also found that accuracy was increased with the greater arrow velocity that resulted from the use of heavier bows. This is because with the center of gravity near the point, the nock end of the arrow acts as a vane to hold the arrow on its course. This steering effect in- creases as the square of the velocity. This explains why a weak bow may drive an arrow accurately at short dis- tances and fail completely at the longer distances. The feathers were next removed from a good tourna- ment arrow 28 inches long and the tests repeated. The results were the same except that with the well-made tournament arrow in place of the one made of an ordi- nary dowel, the accuracy was still greater. In fact, with the tournament arrow and a point heavy enough to put the center of gravity 2/3 to 3/4 the length of the arrow from the nock, and using a bow with a pull of 35 pounds, the accuracy was almost as great up to 120 feet as when using a regular feathered tournament arrow. Of course, at greater distances and consequent lesser velocities, the accuracy fell off rapidly. Similar tests with arrows from 15 to 24 inches long gave similar results. Since accuracy of unfeathered arrows is so largely a matter of balance, it is evident that the heavier the shaft, the heavier the point that can be used. The arrows used in the tests were of relatively light wood and i-5 of an inch in diameter. Hunting arrows are usually of heavier wood and 3/8 of an inch in diameter, so can use corres- pondingly heavier points. From the above, it is evident that stone points up to 4 or 5 inches in length are well within the weight that can be used as arrow points. Whether or not they were so used is difficult to prove but it is quite likely that if they could be used they were; for primitive man, with his limited equipment, was likely to use any tool or weapon that would work. The above also shows that the small points are too light to give the necessary ac- curacy to arrows unless feathers are also used and it seems improbable that in the early use of bows and ar- rows the use of feathers was known. In fact, it could well be that in the development of the bow and arrow, the discovery of the use of feathers was about equal in impor- tance to that of the discovery of the use of the greased patch in the development of the rifle. 83</page></plain_text>
