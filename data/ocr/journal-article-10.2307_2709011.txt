<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANGELS OF REASON: SCIENCE AND MYTH IN THE ENLIGHTENMENT BY DANIEL STEMPEL Natural philosophy and natural religion, rooted in the new philosophy of the seventeenth century and sharing the ideal of a universal simple order, leaned on each other for mutual support. Both Newton and Leibniz, the giants of early eighteenth-century thought, moved back and forth between the mathematical and mechanical models of physics and the logical premises of theology, relying on one or the other to shore up the weak points in their cosmologies. In time, however, with an instinct for distinguishing the known and the unknown from the Unknowable, many eighteenth-century scientists withdrew from their theological outposts, leaving the defense of the faith to natural religion. The sciences, more than ever free to arrive at unpal- atable conclusions, had lost nothing (and gained nothing) from their association with religion. Natural religion, on the other hand, had cut it- self loose from the traditional authority of revelation and was almost totally dependent on scientific study of the natural order to support its claims of evidence of a divine order. While the natural philosopher plod- ded along, the theologian, not content to follow his tracks in the snow, raced ahead and often found himself lost in an infinite wasteland. As Pascal had predicted, the God of natural religion and the God of the Bible became very difficult to reconcile. God had become "le Dieu des philosophes et des savants," the Cartesian deity who had set the world in motion with a flick of His fingers and then had nothing more to do.' For the natural philosophers it was a matter of pride to conceive a God who had created so perfect a universe that a minimum of interven- tion would be needed. Leibniz began his famous epistolary debate with Samuel Clarke, Newton's advocate, by charging that Newton's God was an inept watchmaker who had to reset the cosmic mechanism at in- tervals, while his God had already arranged for such anomalies as miracles before the actual creation. Newton's unfortunate lapse into anthropomorphism, Leibniz suggested, was a symptom of the decay of natural religion in England. Things were not as they had been under Charles II, he mourned, when "Mr. Boyle made it his chief business to inculcate, that every thing was done mechanically in natural philosophy. But it is men's misfortune to grow, at last, out of conceit with reason itself, and to be weary of light. Chimeras begin to appear 'Pascal, Pensees, ed. L.

What has happened in poetry, happens also in the philo- sophical world. People are grown weary of rational romances, such as were the French Clelia, or the German A ramene; and they are become fond again of the tales of fairies."2 The star of reason was, of course, still on the rise in 1716 when Leibniz wrote this passage, and even those fantastic tales which he de- plored were to be brought under its influence. The gulf between science and imagination was not so great that it could not be bridged. Although romantic critics have sometimes thought so, the growing influence of science and rational religion at the expense of revealed religion did not lead to an atrophy of the mythopoeic faculty in eighteenth-century literature. Science too had its revelations; it aroused a sense of wonder growing out of man's pride in the sudden expansion of his knowledge and his humility in the face of the infinite unknown that still lay unex- plored. The poet who wrote "Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night; / God said, 'Let Newton be!' and all was light!" also wrote Superior beings, when of late they saw A mortal man unfold all Nature's law, Admired such wisdom in an earthly shape, And shew'd a Newton as we show an Ape.3 No one (not even Leibniz) doubted that there were such superior be- ings, either angels or dwellers on other planets, who possessed a knowledge beyond the scope of human reason. Since these missing links in the Chain of Being were masters of a wider vision of nature than ours, they became a convenient device for poets who sang the praises of the scientific mind. So, in one of his flights of fancy, Edward Young called on "ye learn'd on earth or bless'd above!/ Ye searching, ye Newtonian angels!" to tell him where God is located in the universe.4 As long as the angels or geniuses were Newtonian or, more generally, rational, not even a Leibniz who preferred his romances to be consonant with reason would be offended. The revelations of these angels, like the traditional revelations of the Bible, were an unveiling of a reality hidden from normal experience, but there the resemblance ceases. In the eighteenth century, before the spread of evolutionary concepts, the revelations of science were not his- torical, millennial, or eschatological; they do not recount a past or 2The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence, ed.

They strip away the limitations of the senses in order to expose an eternal and unchanging Reality. It would be unwise to call this kind of vision "apocalyptic" because of the inevitable connotations associated with the eschatological Book of Revelation. Nevertheless, the eighteenth-century revelation of reason also has a canonical text, al- though it is not part of the Western religious tradition. In the Bha- gavad-Gita, when Krishna reveals the underlying reality of the divine order to Arjuna, giving him "divine sight," he unveils a universe in which creation and destruction are alternate phases of an eternal process, a cosmic ebb and flow in which individuality is a transient phenomenon.5 It is a world-view which is neither apocalyptic nor de- monic, in the sense in which Northrop Frye uses these terms; for the Western observer, schooled in the eschatology of the Christian world myth, it may be either.6 Like the scientific cosmos, it is not man- centered, nor does it have the coordinates of the Western moral topog- raphy, the contrast between up and down (rising or falling), right and left, or center and circumference. The possibility of moral action de- pends solely on the individual's recognition of the distinction between illusion and reality, phenomenon and noumenon. But, if the traditional apocalyptic fable was no longer adequate for scientific revelation, other narrative frames could be adapted to the purposes of didactic allegory. In Leibniz's time the most popular genre of the "contes des fees" was the Oriental tale, modeled on Galland's translations of the Arabian Nights. The moralists were quick to dis- cover the advantages of this genre, for, by transposing their themes into the remote and romantic East, they could demonstrate that rational re- ligion, without the aid of Christian revelation, could arrive at those eternal truths that no man of sense had ever doubted. It is not a mere coincidence that three of the four examples of epiphanic myth cited in this paper are Oriental tales; nor, one might add, is it a coincidence that the fourth is not. I.-Joseph Addison's "Vision of Mirzah" (Spectator, No. 159, Sep- tember 1, 1711) appears, at first glance, to be a simple allegory of pious pessimism which contrasts the vicissitudes of this world with the re- 5The Song of God: Bhagavad-Gita, tr.

As a Christian, Addison was happily freed from the task of apologizing for the trials of life. On the contrary, he underscored the lack of justice in a world of calamities in order to affirm his faith in the redress afforded in an afterlife. Nonetheless, though Addison spurned the deist's praise of an infallible universe, the imagery of his Vision indicates that he shared the deist's predilection for mechanical efficiency. The bridge of human life which the Genius reveals to Mirzah, divided with mathematical exactness into seventy whole arches and ap- proximately thirty broken arches, provides an instructive contrast to the rambling course of Christian and Faithful on their way to the Heavenly City. Addison's allegorical bridge is a static factory assembly line, with its trapdoors and helpful attendants equipped with scimitars and urinals. Some obscure supernatural principle of quality control seems to govern the final distribution of its products, for the virtuous are eventually rewarded, but the bridge itself drops the travelers into the tide in a purely random pattern. The world of Pilgrim's Progress is an arena in which faith and virtue are tested through struggle and trial, but Mirzah's bridge has about as much to do with moral decision as the ridiculous hazards of a seaside amusement park. Its impersonal booby traps are not designed to operate selectively-they swallow the devout and the profane, the wise and the ignorant. Only the automatic move- ment of time over the arches of the years forces the travelers on until the last feeble survivors drop through the broken arches. Addison's Genius revealed somewhat more than he had intended, that curious lack of consistency which allowed so many pious men of the Enlighten- ment to accept the universe of the philosophes and savants, but not their God. II.-In Voltaire's Zadig (1747) the encounter between man and angel discloses a universe which is uncompromisingly rational, the logical cosmos of Leibniz's Theodicee. In this world, governed by the principle of sufficient reason, there are no random loopholes or trapdoors to violate a relentless causality. The Hermit who guides Zadig in the penultimate chapter carries a book, the Book of Destinies, which reveals the pattern of all possible future events. Voltaire's in- genuous hero is shocked by the hermit's inexplicable actions: he steals from a generous benefactor, rewards a miser, burns down the home of a wise and moral man, and throws a young boy into a river and drowns him. When the outraged Zadig calls the hermit to account, he changes into his real form as the Angel Jesrad, and explains that all his acts were motivated by an ultimately moral purpose. Even his drowning of the boy has eliminated more evil than it has caused. In one possible</page><page sequence="5">ANGELS OF REASON 67 future the boy would have murdered both his aunt and Zadig. But, Zadig protests, would it not have been possible to let him live and be vir- tuous? Along this alternative path of future events, Jesrad replies, the boy himself, together with his wife and child, will one day be murdered. Jesrad's Book of Destinies is borrowed from Leibniz's Theodicee, where, to conclude his argument, Leibniz invents his own myth of revelation. Theodorus, the high priest of Jupiter, asks the gods why Sextus Tarquinius, the ambitious Etruscan prince, has been told that he will be exiled from Rome as an adulterer and a traitor. Like Zadig, he asks if Sextus could not have been made a virtuous man. Jupiter sends him to Athena, who grants him a vision of the real nature of things. While sleeping in her temple, Theodorus dreams that the goddess takes him into the palace of the fates, of which she is the guardian, and ex- plains that it consists of an infinite number of halls; each hall is a possible world and each contains a book which lists the destiny of ev- eryone within the circumstances of that particular set of events. The halls rise in the form of a pyramid, extending downward toward an infinite base of less possible worlds and rising to the apex of the one world which is the best of all possible worlds. In some of these worlds there is a Sextus Tarquinius who humbly obeys the gods and lives a long and happy life. But in the best of all worlds, our world, he is fated to be- come a criminal and an exile, so that the Romans may gain their freedom and found a great empire. Athena points out that to choose a world in which Sextus is virtuous and happy would be a violation of Divine Reason which "could not have failed to choose this world which surpasses in perfection all others, and which forms the apex of the pyr- amid. Else would Jupiter have renounced his wisdom, he would have banished me, his daughter."7 Jesrad rephrases the words of Athena: He has created millions of worlds, each entirely unlike the rest. This immense variety is an attribute of his immense power. There are no two leaves of all the trees upon the earth, no two stars in the infinite fields of heaven, which are alike; and all that you see on this little atom where you were born must be fixed in its place and time according to the immutable decrees of him who encompasses all. Men think that this child who has just died fell into the water by accident, and that by such another accident the house was burned; but there is no such thing as accident. All is either trial or punishment, reward or foresight.8 Jesrad warns Zadig that he must not argue about the ways of Divine Reason, he must worship what he cannot understand. Zadig has only 7G. W.

When Voltaire wrote Zadig (1747), like his hero he did not know whether to question or submit. After the Lisbon earthquake of 1755 he rose from his knees, shook his fist at all optimistic Panglosses, and wrote Candide. But, after all, perhaps the Angel Jesrad did have the last word. In 1772 Voltaire confessed: Every present event is born of the past and is father of the future; without it this universe would be an absolutely different universe, as Leibniz puts it so well, who has guessed more correctly in this than in his pre-established harmony. The eternal chain can neither be broken nor confused. The great Being who preserves it by necessity cannot let it waver uncertainly, nor change it; for then he would no longer be the necessary Being, the immutable Being, the Being of beings. He would be weak, inconstant, capricious; He would contradict His nature, he would no longer exist.9 III.-The benevolent Genius of the "Vision of Mirzah" makes his entrance to the tune of his shepherd's pipes, playing celestial music like "those heavenly Airs that are played to the departed Souls of good Men upon their first Arrival in Paradise . ...10 But the Spirit who is invoked by the hero of F. M. Klinger's Der Faust der Morgenldnder (1795) de- serves a more ominous introduction, the kind of music that brings the demon Samiel on stage in Der Freischiitz. The Faust of the Orient, written almost two decades after Klinger's famous play Sturm und Drang had become the symbol of rebellion against the Enlightenment, is one of a series of philosophical tales. Klinger, who had left Germany in 1780 and entered the Russian army as an officer, had long since aban- doned the melodramatic effusions of his youth, but had not given up his quest for freedom. Rebellion against external circumstances, he wrote, is useless if the soul has not first achieved an inner harmony." Klinger's tales are ex- plorations of the possibility of gaining freedom through a voluntary re- nunciation of irrational aims and ambitions; his moral world is a transcription of Kant's ethics into allegorical narrative, for only Kant seemed to offer an escape from the fatality of the eternal chain of cause and effect. To act morally man obeys the dictates of an inner law, not IIl Faut Prendre un Parti ou Le Principe d'Action in Voltaire, Oeuvres Completes (Paris, 1879), XXVIII, 532. 1?The Spectator, ed. Donald F.

To do this, one must accept limitation as part of human freedom. What, Kant asks, would happen, if, like angels, we could foresee the consequences of all our acts? We would then respond automatically to rewards and punish- ments; happiness would be our only goal. But we would also lose our moral freedom, for God and eternity in their awful majesty would stand unceasingly before our eyes.... Thus most actions conforming to the law would be done from fear, few would be done from hope, none from duty. The moral worth of actions, on which alone the worth of the person and even of the world depends in the eyes of supreme wisdom, would not exist at all. The conduct of man, so long as his nature remained where it now is, would be changed into mere mechanism, where, as in a puppet show, everything would gesticulate well but no life would be found in the figures.12 In Klinger's tales Kant's stern morality is the only value that sur- vives a corrosive pessimism. To test the strength of the human spirit Klinger placed his heroes in a world which he described as "wonder- ful, strange, and horrible."'3 When they work toward the reform of the state, their plans end in tyranny and bloodshed. They are betrayed by their friends and exiled by the rulers to whom they devote their lives. Even nature itself appears to turn against them. Abdallah, the hero of The Faust of the Orient, calls up a cold amoral spirit who foretells the consequences of his actions, dispels all of the illusions of man's purblind perceptions, and remorselessly forces Abdallah to confront a shat- tering revelation of the ultimate reality. Abdallah loses his trust in others, his faith in himself, and, finally, his belief in the benevolence of the natural order. When the Spirit, touching Abdallah's eyelids, draws away the last veil, the cosmos appears as a fearful bloody emptiness-filled with formless being-a blood-tinged Nothing in which a horrible nebulous Something swims-which divides itself-unites- devours itself-then again creates itself. The sun, the measure of time of mortals, hung like an orb of dripping blood in the mist and its horrible reflection quivered through the gloomy chaos-so, the whole creation, suddenly and un- divided, pressed on the trembling man and filled his soul, palpitating, strug- gling, whirling, dissolving itself, and recreating itself. Nothing remained outside him any longer-he himself became all-and the confused enormous turmoil expanded his head into immensity-he could no longer separate himself from it-and now he floated whirling in the immense All, which rushed on with him without support or stay.14 '2Immanuel Kant, Critique of Practical Reason [1788], tr.

While Newton and the physicists had staggered the imagination of the Enlightenment with simple formulae that were universally applicable to matter in motion, the biologists who followed them struggled with a complexity that resisted rational analysis. The efficiency of the world machine was a sign of a rational (and therefore benevolent) Creator, who had designed it to operate with a maximum of good and a minimum of evil, in accor- dance with the divine calculus. But when natural philosophers and theologians sought to demonstrate this precise adjustment of means to ends in the organic world, they were not always successful. Isaac Watts (1674-1748) attacked the theory of preformation on just this point. If it were true, he argued, that every Male-Animal contains in it Millions of Animalcules, as Mr. Lewenhoeck supposes by the use of his Microscope, and every such Male Animalcule actually contains Millions of less Animalcules, and so on in Progression for a Hundred or a Thousand Generations of Men, Brutes, or Insects, since the Days of Adam, what an immense Waste of Creatures is here? What an amazing and superfluous Multitude of Dogs, Cats, Lions, Bears, Horses, Elephants, Eagles, and Whales, Worms, and Flies, as well as of Men and Women, all form'd with their Millions of Tubes and Fibres by exquisite Wisdom, and all designed to be meer Wastes of Nature, except those very few which come into the visible World as distinct Animals; since for every Animal that comes to be born there would be many Millions lost and wasted according to this Hypothesis?15 Within thirty years, however, Hume was cautiously suggesting that nature was wasteful: "The whole presents nothing but the idea of a blind nature, impregnated by a great vivifying principle, and pouring forth from her lap, without discernment or parental care, her maimed and abortive children."'6 When Voltaire published his early work on Newton in 1738, he praised him for his rational theism: "In a word, I know not if there is any metaphysical Proof more striking, and more convincing to the Sense of Mankind, than that admirable Order which appears throughout the World; or a finer Argument than this Verse of the Scripture, Coeli enarrant gloriam Dei. And we find that Sir ISAAC NEWTON uses no other at the End both of his Opticks and his Prin- cipia."'7 By 1772, however, Voltaire, still looking for evidences of de- '5Philosophical Essays (3rd ed., London, 1742), 214.

Baker (London, 1748), 8-9.</page><page sequence="9">ANGELS OF REASON 71 sign, was a horrified observer of a process on his own planet that seemed to negate his earlier praise of an "admirable Order." The animal kingdom, Voltaire noted, lives by devouring life: "And what is even more cruel is that in this horrible scene of murders that are constantly renewed, one sees clearly a design formed to perpetuate all species by the bloody corpses of their enemies. These victims expire only after nature has carefully made sure to furnish new ones. All is born again for murder."18 The shift from the rational universe of Newton and Leibniz to Klinger's terrifying revelation is reflected in the change of imagery from machine to monster. The romantic worship of life, like most faiths, wa- vered between reverence and fear; it was not always possible to distin- guish between the daemonic and the demonic. Wordsworth's vision of a universe pervaded by a motion and a spirit was Schopenhauer's night- mare. Werther, that sensitive indicator of the tremors of the impending romantic eruption, saw, in a moment of frightening insight, nothing in nature but "an eternally devouring, eternally ruminating monster."19 The same image appears in that brilliant tour de force of romantic nihilism, Die Nachtwachen des Bonaventura (1804), where life is described as a ravenous monster cloaked in a fool's motley: "Everything is Nothing, and retches itself upward and swallows itself down greedily; and this self-devouring is just the malignant illusion that there is Something, when, if the choking ceased, simply the Nothing would appear, so that all would be terrified in its presence. Fools take this cessation to be Eternity, but it is the intrinsic Nothing and absolute death, since life, in contrast, originates only through a constant perishing."20 Eighteenth-century biological speculation opened the way to the metaphysical subtlety of Schopenhauer's cosmic Will-to-live. For Goethe and Klinger, the biological process is eternal, but for Bonaven- tura and Schopenhauer, who understand and share the nihilism of the Hindu canonical texts, the life process is itself an illusion. Bonaventura suggests that if it were to halt, the phenomenal world would vanish. The denial or halting of the Will, in Schopenhauer's philosophy, is an ethical act of individual abnegation which-for the individual-achieves the same end, annihilation. When the individual ceases to will, self and world disappear and only the intrinsic Nothing remains. 1811 Faut Prendre un Parti, XXVIII, 534. '9Die Leiden des Jungen Werthers, ed. E.

In the fourth Memorable Fancy of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1793), Blake's Angel threatens him with damnation and takes him to see his "eternal lot," leading him through a stable, a church, the church vault, a mill at the end of the vault, and into a cavern. A "void boundless as a nether sky" opens beneath the cave and reveals an "infinite Abyss": "beneath us, at an immense distance, was the sun, black but shining; round it were fiery tracks on which revolv'd vast spiders, crawling after their prey, which flew, or rather swum, in the infinite deep...." A black tempest obscures the scene and from the darkness a scaly sea monster, Leviathan, emerges and heads toward them. The Angel hastily climbs back up into the mill, leaving Blake alone. But the monster in the void vanishes when the Angel goes and Blake finds himself by a quiet stream where a harper is singing a song whose theme is "The man who never alters his opinion is like standing water &amp; breeds reptiles of the mind." Returning to the mill, Blake finds the surprised Angel and explains, "All that we saw was owing to your metaphysics...."21 The path of Blake and the Angel traces the history of Christianity from the Nativity (stable) to the founding of a church, to the death of faith in organized religion (the vault), into the mill of logic, and finally into the cavern of the five senses, the closed universe of natural philosophy: They told me that I have five senses to inclose me up, And they inclos'd my infinite brain into a narrow circle, And sunk my heart into the Abyss, a red, round globe.... (Vision of the Daughters of Albion, 191) The cavern of the five senses opens into the void of the Newtonian universe, the infinite abyss of space. The frontispiece in the first volume of Andrew Motte's translation of Newton's Principia (1729) shows a Genius with a pair of compasses in one hand, displaying to an awe- struck figure in a classical robe an astronomical view of the solar system through a hole in a bank of dark clouds on which they are perched. The sun is a small white circle about which the elliptical paths of the planets are traced, with lines radiating out to connect the sun with the planetary orbits. The solar system appears to be a geometric spider web suspended in the void below the two observers. Following 2'Blake, Complete Writings, ed. Geoffrey Keynes (London, 1971), 155-57. All references in the text are cited from this edition.</page><page sequence="11">ANGELS OF REASON 73 Swedenborg (whose visions he is parodying), Blake makes the sun black to indicate that it is the "natural" sun, as opposed to the spiritual sun.22 Blake used the Newtonian sun of Motte's plate as a symbol of Satan in Jerusalem, his last prophetic book; he calls Satan "the great Selfhood,/ Satan, Worship'd as God by the Mighty Ones of the Earth,/ Having a white Dot call'd a Center, from which branches out/ A Circle in con- tinual gyrations ..." (p. 659). Henry Crabb Robinson also reported Blake as saying, "I have conversed with the Spiritual Sun. I saw him on Primrose Hill. He said, 'Do you take me for the Greek Apollo?' 'No' I said, 'that (pointing to the sky) is the Greek Apollo. He is Satan.' "23 As a contemporary of Erasmus Darwin and an illustrator of his works, Blake, like Klinger and Voltaire, was acquainted with natural history as well as natural philosophy, and viewed one as the logical out- growth of the other. Newtonian space spawns the monsters of the bio- logical cosmos. When a tempest boils out of the void, obscuring the solar system, a symbolic "reptile of the mind" emerges, bred by the metaphysics of the scientific Angel who, like all scientists, never alters his opinion. (Blake may have been thinking of the phrase "rerumque im- mobilis ordo" in the lines by Halley which appear above Motte's fron- tispiece.) He despised the singlemindedness of scientists: "May God us keep," he prayed, "from Single vision &amp; Newton's sleep" (818). The transition from the mechanical universe to the biological is even more explicit in the lines following his identification of Satan as the "white Dot call'd a Center," which "became a Heart/ From which sprang numerous branches varying their motions,/ Producing many heads, three or seven or ten, &amp; hands &amp; feet/ Innumerable at will of the unfortunate contemplator/ Who becomes his food: such is the way of the Devouring Power." In the second part of this Memorable Fancy Blake himself assumes the role of an Angel of Reason and takes the Angel to see his eternal lot. With the Angel in his arms, he flies up above the earth's shadow and flings himself into the sun. This, of course, is the natural sun, which is the realm of Satan. Here Blake becomes an Angel of Reason by robing himself in white and taking Swedenborg's volumes in his hand. They ar- rive at the void between Saturn and the fixed stars and Blake sneeringly informs his Newtonian adversary, "Here is your lot, in this space-if 22Martin K.

Newtonian space exists only in the Angel's metaphysics, not in Blake's, and Blake is showing the Angel where his metaphysics will lead them. They return to the stable and the church and Blake opens the Bible on the altar, which becomes a deep pit, into which he descends, driving the reluctant Angel ahead. They find seven houses of brick, in one of which is "a number of monkeys, baboons, &amp; all of that species, chain'd by the middle, grinning and snatching at one another, but withheld by the shortness of their chains." When the monkeys increase in number, the strong copulate with the weak, then tear them apart and devour them, while making a show of "seeming fondness." This allegory has been interpreted (like the rest of Blake) in many ways, but surely Blake is satirizing Rousseau's social theories. Rousseau viewed man in his natural state as a higher form of ape who through the pressure of population growth and diminishing food supply has learned to talk and to cooperate with other men. Rousseau's fa- mous dictum, "Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains," is cleverly twisted by Blake to create his own sardonic version of The So- cial Contract. With his single vision, Rousseau, beginning with the pre- mise of the natural man, was led by his logical and historical analysis of human nature and society to an inevitable conclusion: "Let us reflect what must be the state of things, when men are forced to caress and destroy one another at the same time...."24 The Marriage of Heaven and Hell is Blake's declaration of independence from all that is merely "natural": natural philosophy, natural religion, natural history, and l'homme naturel. Blake's last word to his Angel is "... it is but lost time to converse with you whose works are only Analytics." V.-Traditional angels are, of course, messengers, and their revela- tions are communications from the spiritual realm to the natural or his- torical realm. But in a universe in which all is natural and nothing is spiritual, what sort of revelation is possible? Descartes had subtly and perhaps unwittingly shifted the problem of communication between in- commensurable modes of being by simply omitting the spiritual and di- viding the natural into a res cogitans and a res extensa, the world of the mind and the world of matter in motion. The existence of a coherent universe, for Descartes, rested on the assumption that the divine wisdom had, in some way unknown to us, linked the two realms in the human brain and made thoughts correspond to physical events. The experience of external reality is simply the mind's interpretation of physical changes in the brain, which it translates into its own language of perception and mental constructs. Only when our perceptions are 24"A Discourse on the Origin of Inequality," The Social Contract and Discourses, tr. G.D.H.

Or, to put it another way, the language of reason is the only language which the mental and material realms possess in common; it is their only trustworthy mode of communi- cation. Thus the voice of reason becomes the voice of revelation, for what it reveals lies beyond the limits of unanalyzed human experience. As Addison pointed out, Things would make but a poor Appearance to the Eye, if we saw them only in their proper Figures and Motions: And what Reason can we assign for their exciting in us many of those Ideas which are different from any thing that exists in the Objects themselves, (for such are Light and Colours) were it not to add Supernumerary Ornaments to the Universe, and make it more agreeable to the Imagination? ... In short, our Souls are at present delightfully lost and bewil- dered in a pleasing Delusion, and we walk about like the Enchanted Hero of a Romance, who sees beautiful Castles, Woods, and Meadows; and at the same time hears the warbling of Birds, and the Purling of Streams; but upon the finishing of some secret Spell, the fantastick Scene breaks up, and the dis- consolate Knight finds himself on a barren Heath, or in a solitary Desart (III, 546-47). A century later the Romantics would blame science for the im- poverishment of human experience, but Addison believed that the fault lay with the weakness of the imagination, which had been outstripped by the explorations of reason in the realms of the infinite and infini- tesimal. The world of matter appears barren because the imagination of man is incapable of appreciating the glories of the universe. "Beings of a higher Nature," he supposed, "very much excell us in this respect, as it is probable the Soul of Man will be infinitely more perfect hereafter in this Faculty, as well as in all the rest; insomuch that, perhaps, the Imagination will be able to keep Pace with the Understanding, and to form in itself distinct Ideas of all the different Modes and Quantities of Space" (III, 577). For Addison, the function of allegory is to translate the revelations of reason into the humble language of the imagination. Like light and color the imagination supplies an aesthetic embellishment to "the most illustrious Scenes in the Universe." The "Polite Masters of Morality, Criticism, and other Speculations abstracted from Matter" use this genre to "transcribe Ideas out of the Intellectual World into the Ma- terial" (III, 577). As one of these Polite Masters, Addison, intending to write a cautionary tale on the vanity of human wishes, transcribed his Ideas into the material world of Newton and was betrayed by the new physics into a pessimism which was certainly not Christian and only re-</page><page sequence="14">76 DANIEL STEMPEL motely moral. Like Newton's God, Mirzah's Genius is a bystander, a deus extra machinam, who observes men as particles in motion, timed by the ticking of a cosmic clock, as they complete their passage from Point A to Point B (or C or D), depending on the frequency of those hid- den trapdoors. Similarly, in Voltaire's allegory, the Angel Jesrad mimics Leibniz's God who cannot violate the laws of His own reason-understanding all, He forgives all, including Himself. Mere mortals like Zadig, incapable of seeing the universe sub specie rationis, can only fall on their knees and worship blindly. Both tales demonstrate the growing disparity be- tween explanation by cause and effect, as in natural philosophy, and explanation by purpose, the traditional argument of revealed religion, which was taken over by natural theology and applied to the data of science. Addison reduces the pilgrimage of man to an obstacle course of mechanical hazards, then tacks on the traditional rewards and punish- ments of an afterlife, and concludes that the latter justifies the former. Voltaire accepts the logic of the determination of all events by final causes, but has already begun to question the pragmatic relevance of theodicy and its remote ends to the actual human comedy (or tragedy). When these two exempla are placed side by side, the unconscious revelation of Addison's Genius appears not only absurdly illogical but almost as comic in its Shandyan innocence as Voltaire's deliberate two- edged satire of human fallibility and divine infallibility. Klinger's tale echoes the disillusion of a generation which could not be comforted by the glories of the Newtonian universe. The Cartesian breach between mind and matter had widened beyond the problem of knowledge into the realm of moral action. Kant recognized that the ambivalence of the human condition rested on the possibility of al- ternate points of view, the scientific and the moral. The scientific perspective, the "view of a countless multitude of worlds, annihilates, as it were, my importance as an animal creature, which must give back to the planet (a mere speck in the universe) the matter from which it came, the matter which is for a little time provided with vital force, we know not how." The opposing view, derived from the inner sense, not the senses, "infinitely raises my worth as that of an intelligence by my per- sonality, in which the moral law reveals a life independent of all ani- mality and even of the whole world of sense."25 The unbroken chain of cause and effect exists only in the phenomenal world; the mind is free within its own realm, the noumenal universe of morality. 25Critique of Practical Reason, op. cit., 259.</page><page sequence="15">ANGELS OF REASON 77 Klinger's Spirit, bound to the phenomenal world, can reveal only what physical nature can reveal to the scientist. As Klinger points out, he is not one of the blessed Genii of virtue who dwell in an ethereal paradise over the Caucasus; he is one of the spirits of the cold and gloomy isles whose only function is to observe mankind, whom they neither hate nor love (V, 22-24). Abdallah's frightening vision is only a glimpse of what lies behind external reality: "Now you see that which is outside you as it would appear to you without the beneficent veil of illusion" (V, 169). While the Spirit can destroy Abdallah's faith in the goodness of man and nature, he cannot touch the inner moral world. Chastened by his experience, Abdallah renounces his quest for forbid- den knowledge and is restored, like Job, to his former state. In Klinger's allegory the revelation of reality eludes both reason and imagination. The universe appears for a moment as a blind irrational self-devouring entity, but Klinger ignores it as still another layer of illusion produced by the phenomenal cosmos. Nothing is real except what is real for us-the free human will and the moral law which it obeys. Blake's Angel of Reason is one of those pedantic Swedenborgian an- gels, armed with a degree from some heavenly Uppsala, who can ex- plain everything, spiritual or natural. Blake was impatient with this in- trusion of rationalism into the spiritual sphere: "I have always found that Angels have the vanity to speak of themselves as the only wise; this they do with a confident insolence sprouting from systematic rea- soning" (157). Blake himself was not devoid of a confident insolence, but it did not sprout from systematic reasoning. His authority was the prophetic imagination or the Poetic Genius, as he called it, and he spurned the eighteenth-century allegory, with its condescending employment of imagination to embellish the teachings of Addison's "Polite Masters of Morality." Blake rejected all forms of allegory, in- cluding the popular Oriental tale, as "a totally distinct &amp; inferior kind of Poetry. Vision or Imagination is a Representation of what Eternally Exists, Really &amp; Unchangeably. Fable or Allegory is form'd by the daughters of Memory" (604). Blake's own work was often as overtly di- dactic as the allegories he condemned, but his teaching, he felt, was no more allegorical than "the Hebrew Bible &amp; the Gospel of Jesus" which "are not Allegory, but Eternal Vision or Imagination of All that Exists." His revelations were not the revelations of reason. Blake's satire in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell marks the logical, though not the historical, termination of the rational epiphanic myth. The revelations of the Angels of Reason continued into the nine- teenth century, but the tone of confident insolence vanished. Although</page><page sequence="16">78 DANIEL STEMPEL science went on to new triumphs, the contemplation of the glories of the universe became less consoling, and the angelic voices seemed to grow more plaintive. At times it seemed that the heavens, no longer declaring the glory of God, had become the spider web of Blake's Memorable Fancy: "The stars," she whispers, "blindly run; A web is woven across the sky; From out waste places comes a cry, And murmurs from the dying sun; "And all the phantom, Nature, stands- With all the music in her tone, A hollow echo of my own- A hollow form with empty hands."
