<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Dramas of Spiritual Progress: The Lord and the Servant in Julian's Showings 51 and the Lost Heir in Lotus Sutra 4 "God is subde but he is not malicious/7 Albert Einstein 1 JULIAN AND THE LOTUS SUTRA Since both Christianity and Buddhism are soteriological religions, they speak of somewhere to go, of change, progress and pilgrimage. In order to compare the progress in each religion, I have chosen two parables from the traditions: the parable of the Lord and the Servant in Chapter 51 of the Showings of Julian of Norwich, and the parable of the Father and the Lost Heir in Chapter 4 of the Lotus Sutra. Julian lived in England from 1342-c. 1423 A.D. and received a series of 16 revelations or showings on May 13,1373, while she was gravely, ap parently mortally, ill. When she recovered she wrote down her experi ences, first somewhat briefly and, many years later upon mature reflec tion, at much greater length. She wrote in Middle English in the forth right, no-nonsense style of the Northerner, but her austerity had nothing to do with the wrath of God. Indeed, that seemed to be the problem. She knew about hell and damnation from the teaching of the Church, and was puzzled that her revelations contained no mention of either. The pur pose and the meaning of the revelations, so she was told, was love. The puzzle of how this love could be so complete and yet not deny sin, blame and condemning, was resolved by her vision, in the 14th revelation, of the parable of the Lord and the Servant: And then oure curteyse lorde answeryd in shewyng full mystely by a wonderfull example of a lorde that hat a servannt. . . {Showings, 513)1 It seems to be a measure of her perplexity that she includes this parable only in the longer text. On the face of it, it struck her at first as perhaps heretical, but then the subdety of the image, as we shall see, occurred to her. 65</page><page sequence="2">The Lotus Sutra is one of the most important scriptures of Mah?y?na Buddhism. It appears to have been put together piecemeal in northern In dia, and to have been completed around 200 C.E. Its full title is Saddharma yundanka Sutra, i.e., "The Sutra on the White Lotus of True Buddhism/7 It is written in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit2 (a form intermediate between vulgar Prakrit and cultured Sanskrit) and has an apologetic, even a polem ical, intent. A vocal minority of Buddhists in the Indian Subcontinent were protest ing more and more what they considered to be the degeneration of the Sharm (Buddhism) from the Saddharma or True Buddhism as taught by the Buddha. They claimed that many Buddhists had lost sight of the true nobility of the teaching, and had become content to preach individual liberation rather than calling all living beings (sattvas) to the fullness of compassion for all other living beings. They called themselves Mah?y?n ists (those of the Great Way) and stigmatized other Buddhists as Hinay?n ists (those of the Defective or Preliminary Way). True Buddhism, they said, does not preach nirvana as an escape from sams?ra (the round of rebirth), as the Hlnay?nists maintained, but, as the lotus is rooted in the mud but undefiled by it, it is "unstuck77 (Chinese; wu chu) or "unsupported77 (Sanskrit: ayratisthita) in or by either sams?ra or nirvana. This grand vision is illustrated by the parable of the Father and the Lost Heir in chapter four of the Lotus. The parable is told not by the Buddha but to the Buddha, in confirmation of his teachings, by four disciples3 generally associated with Hinay?na Buddhism: they tell how they have come to believe in the Mah?y?na. Both parables, then, are concerned with correcting what is seen as a defi ciency of love in the traditions. This deficiency is regarded as a corruption, or misunderstanding, of the fullness of the tradition, and the true teaching of love is presented in dramatic form. To these dramas we now turn. Z OUTLINE OF THE PARABLES (a) The Lord and the Servant: Julian sees a regal male figure, sumptuously robed, who is, however, sit ting on the ground in a bare and hostile landscape. He has only one ser vant, who stands before him a litde to his left, and is poorly and scantily clad in a manner that Julian regards as inappropriate: This is not an unsemely clothyng for the seruant that is so heyly lovyd to stond in before so wurschypfull a lord. {Showings, 528) 66</page><page sequence="3">Then, at some silent command which the servant instantly recognizes, he runs off hastily and; due to his eagerness and heedlessness; falls into a gulch in which he writhes painfully, unable to rise: The servannt nott onely he goyth; but sudenly he stertyth and rynnyth in grett hast for loue to do his lordes wylle. And anon he fallyth in a slade, and takyth ful grett sorow; and than he gronyth and monyth and wallowyth and wryeth; but he may not ryse nor helpe hym selfe by no manner of weye. (Showings, 514f.) It is then revealed to Julian that the servant is to bring back "a tresoure in the erth whych the lorde lovyd77 (Showings, 529), which was not a static treasure, like a jewel, but a fruit which needed to be culltivated, as by a gardener: He shuld be a gardener, deluyng and dykyng and swetyng and tumyng the erth vp and down, and seke the depness and water the plantes in tyme. And in this he shulde contynue his traveyle, and make swete flodys to rynne and nobylle plentuousnesse fruyte to spryng, whych he shulde bryng before the lorde, and serve hym therwith to his lykynk. (Showings, 531) Subsequently, when the servant's work is finished, he is rewarded with rich robes and a crown, and is made to sit on the right of his lord "in endless rest and pees;; (Showings, 544). The vision is then explained as a parable of the Fall, Redemption and Glorification. (b) The Father and the Heir The four disciples tell of a young man who runs away from home. His father sorrowfully and unsuccessfully goes in search of him, while the son wanders abroad for fifty years and accidentally returns to his native land. The father "settles in a city in the middle/74 that is, perhaps, he meets his son halfway, and becomes extremely wealthy. The son, now im poverished and seeking menial work, happens upon his father's house and "stands by the side of the gate775 in awe, then decides that, by seeking a job with the august figure whom he sees on a lion throne surrounded by ministers and servants, he would be above his station, and so he runs off to find a poor village. His father, however, recognizes him, and has him ac costed and brought before him. Viewing his son's terror and ignorance of his true status as he lies groveling before him, he lets him go, but he "secretly sends two men776 who say to him "You are hired to clear away 67</page><page sequence="4">manure [i.e., probably "to clean out the latrines77], and we two will work with you.777 The father also disguises himself as a laborer, working alongside his son, and speaks to him at times roughly-"Work hard!" and at times fondly-"You are like a son to me."8 This goes on for twenty years, until the father, having fallen ill, pro motes his son to bursar, putting him in charge of all his wealth, and say ing to him 'There is now no differences between us.778 The son, however, still thinks of himself as a hireling. Later, when the father judges his son to be ready, he publicly announces his paternity in emphatic terms: This person here is my son; I have begotten him . . . This person is truly my son. I am truly his father. (10) The son rejoices greatly "having obtained something new7711 and thinks: I used to have no expectations, but now all this wealth has come to me automatically! (12) The four disciples then explain the parable as an allegory of progress from Hinay?na to Mah?y?na. 3 STRUCTURAL SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES (a) The Lord and the Father The lord and the father are sumptuously attired, and they sit, denoting their power. The lord, however, sits on the bare earth at the beginning of the parable, and obtains a glorious throne, similar to that of the father, only after the work of the servant is completed. Julian regards the lord's sitting as symbolic of the lack of labor in the divinity, and his sitting on the earth in anthropoid form as a symbol of God's voluntary closeness to our human nature. Although the sutra does not so interpret it, the sitting of the father can be seen as symbolic of the "worklessness77 or lack of kar mic effect (Sanskrit: na karma prabhava) of the quiescent Dharma Body (samat? dharma kayo) which is, according to Mah?y?na, the "work'7 of the Buddhas as viewed from their own perspective. And then, the disguise which the father adopts so as to labor next to his son can be seen as the compassionate precipitation (or, to borrow a term, kenosis) of the formless Dharmak?ya into the anthropomorphic Nirm?nak?ya, the form suitable for teaching humans. The blue robe of the lord, which, by its fullness, "betokenyth that he hath enclosyd in hym all hevyns" (Showings, 527) might be compared with the skin color of the Fundamental Buddha (?dibuddha) which is regularly visual ized in the Tibetan liturgy as sky-blue, symbolizing Emptiness. 68</page><page sequence="5">The lord has only one attendant, but Julian tells us he stands not only for God the Son but also for all mankind. The many servants of the father have no function in the parable other than to emphasize the father's mag nificence. However, the two lowly servants who are sent to assist the heir in his odoriferous duties may be regarded as Bodhisattvas, who compassion ately take rebirth as apparendy ignorant and stupid beings in order to be of help to them. Thus, both regal figures have attendants whose office is the service of lesser beings. Both the lord and the father look with love on the servant and heir. They both sternly command, but do so out of a final concern for their ser vant's wellbeing. At the last, the lord sits enthroned in heaven and the father dies, passing on his inheritance-i.e., he returns to the conditoin of the formless Dhar mak?ya. Thus, both regain their true highness, which they had temporar ily forsaken for salvific reasons. (b) The Servant and the Heir The servant and the heir are both impoverished, contrasting strongly with the magnificence of their masters. They constantly move about, and both fall helpless to the ground. When they stand before their masters, they do so humbly and respectfully, to one side. The falling of the ser vant, however, is an accident, owing to his heedless zeal, while the heir falls because he is terrified. Both labor at manual occupations, but the labor of the servant as a gar dener is productive, while the labor of the heir is mere housekeeping. However, the productive labor of the servant (which we may think of as a divine-human synergy such as is evident in the divine-human reciprocity of offerings at Mass) may be compared with the symbolism, found else where in the Mah?y?na, of the Tath?gatagarbha or Embryo of the Buddha Nature; this would be the Buddha Nature in us, as the embryo of a world emperor {caleravartin) might be in the womb of an outcast woman; we are to bring it (or him) to birth. Then again, the housekeeping of the heir is ex plained as the clearing away of mental defilements, which could be com pared with a Christian's clearing away his sins, with God's help. When the servant finishes his work, he receives cosmic riches symbol ized by a robe "of feyer semely medolour" (Showings, 543), i.e., perhaps, of polychromatic brilliance, similar to the clothing of rainbow light which is ascribed to Buddhas in liturgical visualizations. The heir then enters into the richness of his father's inheritance. We come now to the symbolism, the main theme of which might be "gaining what we have already," with Julian's case first. 69</page><page sequence="6">Generally, the parable is explained as symbolizing the Fall of Adam (i.e., of humanity) and his redemption and glorification through the work of Christ. The subdety of the parable lies in the polymorphism of the sym bolism of the servant: he is both Adam and Christ. As Adam, he is all hu manity, "For in the syghte of god alle man is oone man, and oone man is alle man;; (Showings, 522), and thus his departure from the lord, whom Julian understands "that he is god" (Showings, 521) is the primordial separa tion of the creature from the Creator. His fall is then the falling of human ity into hell. Then comes the twist. Julian expects to see the servant blamed for his foolishness, as Holy Church has taught her, but although she looks carefully, she sees none: I behelde with avysement to wytt yf I culde perceyve in hym ony defau3te, or yf the lorde shuld assigne in hymn ony maner of blame; and verely there was none seen, for oonly hys good wyll and his grett desyer was cause of his fallyng. (Showings, p. 516) It comes to her that the servant is also Christ. We are, she says, to under stand the servant to be both Adam and Christ, and to see them both en closed in him: she plays on the double meaning of "comprehended": In the servant is / comprehendyd the second person of the trynyte, and in the seruannt is comprehendyd Adam, that is to sey all men. (Showings, 532) The running of Christ is in obedience, not sin, and his falling is into Mar^s womb, wherein he blamelessly suffers the pains and limitations of our mortal state. This is made clear in the lord;s "double gazing" on the servant: in pity for Adam, who hurt himself by sinning; and in joy for Christ, who is seen as incipiendy restoring Adam's dignity and going be yond it to the eschatalogical glorification: The rewth and the pytty of the fader was of the fallyng of Adam, whych is his most lovyd creature. The joy and the blysse was of the fallyng of his deerwurthy son, whych is evyn with the fader. (Showings, 524) There is then a tension between AdanVs pain, blame, ignorance and sin; and Christ;s joy, blamelessness, gnosis and righteousness. And since both Adam and Christ are "comprehended" in the one figure of the servant, this tension is found also in all Christians. From our point of view, we are sinful Adam and, having fallen into the gulch, we can no longer turn and see the loving gaze of God:</page><page sequence="7">But man is blyndyd in this life; and therefore we may nott se oure fader god as he is. (Showings, 525) However, the love of God for the soul is constant, and although he looks with "rewth and pytte," his "joy and blysse passyth as ferr the rewth and the pytte as hevyn is aboue erth.;; (Showings, 524). That is to say, humanity is blameworthy from its own point of view, and sinless from God;s point of view. These two conditions are both as real as each other, and they contain each other as, according to the Church's teaching, the humanity and the divinity of Christ are co inherent. Thus, the pilgrimage to glory must be undertaken, and there is nowhere to go. The parable in the Lotus Sutra is less subde than Julian's, but it is more complicated. As elsewhere in the sutra, the Buddha is symbolized by a rich old man. The heir leaves him for no apparent reason other than stupidity (moha)-this is the root passion in the standard list of the three basic poi sons: lust (ra?ga), hate (dvesa) and befuddlement (moha). As a result, the heir (that is, all sattvas) wanders through many Incarnations as a human, a deity, an animal, a hungry ghost (preta) and a hell-dweller (nairdyaka). After a long time, through the fruiting of karma (i.e., as it were "accidentally") he returns to his native land, i.e., he is once again re-born as a human at a time when the Dharma (Buddhism) is known. This is one of the four for tunate events: to be born as a human; to be born when and where the Dharma is known; actually to hear the Dharma; and to have the leisure to practice it. These four events are said to be rarely met with, even in hun dreds of thousands of rebirths; therefore when they do occur, the opportu nity should be seized fervently. The heir first sees his father in his glorious aspect, and he is terrified, see ing him as a judge and a vastly superior being. All Buddhas are said, by the Mah?y?na, to have two "forms": the un manifest, formless and placeless Dharmak?ya; and the manifest, embodied and locatable R?pak?ya. The R?yak?ya, further, has two aspects: the glorious Sambhogak?ya and the kenotic Nirmanakdya. The Sambhogak?ya form is that of the icons: the body shines with a golden hue; it is perfecdy formed; it is endowed with all the signs of a superman (mah?purusa)} and it rivals the cosmic mountain in size. Such a form is suitable for preaching to the deities, who are as nauseated or amused by humans as humans are by monkeys, but it overwhelms a human who does not know that he is also really a Buddha. Thus, the Buddha adopts the Nirmanakdya or human form, in which he eats, sleeps and functions like any other human. And so it is that the father in our parable puts off his grand robes, smears him 71</page><page sequence="8">self with dirt; and works alongside his son. He calls his son "son,77 just as Hinay?na monks were called Buddhaputra (Buddha Son) and took a Bud dhist name, but the son regards the word, as would a Hinay?na monk, merely as a courtesy title.13 The father then promotes his son to bursar, so that he knows "how much is contained7714 in the storehouses. A Hihay?nist monk would be ac customed to preach on the magnificence of the state of a full and perfect Buddha (samyaksambuddha) but would himself only aspire to personal lib eration from sams?ra, "Arhatship." Then comes the moment of the revelation of paternity and, according to the customs of the time, "he does not merely inherit from his father: he inherits his father."15 The son now enters in to the fullness of his father7s estate, as if he had not worked for, but as if he already possessed it which, in fact, he did.16 The Buddhist reader of the parable is then confronted with the paradox that, although he is a Buddha, he must become a Buddha. This is the para dox which Zen Master Dogen (1200-1253 C.E.) took as his lifetime le?an. In the technical terms of developed Japanese Buddhism, he asked himself, how do we reconcile Inherent Englightenment (hongaleu) with Realized Enlightenment (shikaku), Dogen solved his k?an in the famous mondo (dialogue) with his Chinese teacher Ju-ching (1163-1268 C.E.): Ju-ching: In Zen, body and mind are dropped off. Dogen: Drop off body and mind! Ju-ching had pointed directly at an?tman (the absence of an essential ego nucleus): we are not our bodies, clearly-but nor are we our minds. What are we? Dogen saw that the shreds of an ego-nucleus were still there so long as the self was asking itself who it was, and whether it was a Buddha or not, so he replied that, even the idea of not being, our bodies or our minds must be discarded. This is a precise answer to the dilemma posed both by the Lotus Sutra and Julian7s Showings, but its elegance may be missed by those unfamiliar with Mak?y?na logic. Let me explain further. Mah?y?na says that reality may be viewed under two aspects: conven tional and transcendental. The first aspect is called samvrtisatya, the con ventional or "covered truth, and its viewpoint is called samvrtitas. In it, things are more or less as they seem to us as unenlightened beings. Specifically, suffering exists, and progress is necessary from suffering {sam s?ra) to liberation (nirv?na). The second aspect is called param?rthasatya, the "further truth,77 and its viewpoint is called yaram?rthitas. In it, nothing has 71</page><page sequence="9">ever come to be (not even the observer of a "nothing out there/7 be it care fully noted) so that nothing can ever decay and; of course, there is no suffering, no liberation, and no progress from one to the other. But this is not all. When reality is seen with the Buddha Eye, a third aspect appears which is not an additional aspect or truth but a way of seeing the unity of the first two aspects. It is called madhyamasatya or the Middle Truth, and is synonymous with Conditioned Co-Arising (pratitya samutpdda). Emptiness (snyat?)j Tathdgatagarbha, Dharmakdya, and even "Buddhism/7 In it, both the samvrtitas and param?rthitas aspects are equally true. Borrowing from the Council of Nicaea, we may say that they are co-inherent,17 and thus the pilgrimage must be undertaken and there is nowhere to go. 4 CONCLUSION We have seen how two examples from very different religious tradi tions-Buddhism and Christianity-speak of a similar structure of the spir itual life. From the point of view of the limited being (the creature or the sattva) there is misery and suffering. The Christian is, in addition, tor mented by sin and the Buddhist by ignorance. Their common lot appears hopeless, but they contact a savior or a teacher, and begin to move toward salvation or liberation. The cosmic irony, and the ultimate joy, is that such misery and defeat is not their true state. In the eyes of God (sub specie aeternitatis) or the Buddhas (param?rthitas) they are Sons of God or are them selves Buddhas. But, due to the effects of sin and ignorance, this is not how they appear to themselves, and their defeat is real. To use a Buddhist simile, suffering is not an illusion, like a coil of rope which might be mis taken for a snake, but its nature is empty, like a banana tree, whose trunk is massive but hollow. Thus, they must work to become what they are. Suffering and ignorance are limitations imposed by the rebellious (Chris tian) or ignorandy fabricated (Buddhist) separate and limited ego, which lusts and hates so as to preserve itself, upon a universe characterized ulti mately by limitless love. The message of both parables is, in the words of Mother Julian, that all manner thing shall be well, but this is not a simplis tic denial of the reality of suffering, in what William James has called "once-born77 religion. In this mortal life, or before we are Buddhas, suffer ing must needs be, but "suddenly the end of all our striving77 we will see what we always were. The perichdresis of suffering and joy, finitude and boundlessness, work and rest, is a mystery only expressible as the intra deical love of the Trinity for Himself, or as the Empitness of the Middle Truth.18 The question then arises, "Are Emptiness and God the same thing?771 would like the question to go away, for not only do I not know how to 73</page><page sequence="10">answer it; I do not know if it is actually, as it appears prima facie to be; a question. On the face of it; Emptiness cannot be God; for Emptiness neither creates nor speaks, nor indeed is it a thing or even a viewpoint: Ndgarjuna explicidy calls it the purgative of all viewpoints. And God, we know, creates, speaks, is a "thing/7 and is both viewing and viewable. But, do we really know this? Once we go beyond the confident assertions of cata phatic theology, all our signposts vanish. We cannot even say that God is a Nothing and then rashly equate this Nothing with a grievously mis taken idea of Emptiness.19 The question, however, will not go away. Like Marlens ghost, it comes to haunt me at least once a year-usually at Easter, which is near enough to Bodhi Day to send querulous tremors through my Buddhist-Christian stream-of-becoming. And here it is Eastertide again, and coming up to Wesak (the Therav?din festival of Buddha7s birth, enlightenment and parinib bdna, celebrated on the May full moon). So what can I say this time? Only that this attempt to sit at the feet of Mother Julian and the un known authors of the Lotus Sutra, and listen hard and well, has made me wonder if an examination of the co-inherence of achievement and posses sion, the English "realization77 and the French ?realisation? might not point the way to a hyperbridge between Emptiness and, if not God, at least the aseity of the Mind of Christ. A student recently asked me "Can Emptiness will?771 entend to speculate on this in a subsequent essay.20 Roger Corless Duke University Notes 1 Showings refers to Edmund College and James Walsh, A book of Showing to the An choress Julian of Norwich.
