<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ovid's Universal Flood by Alan H. F. Griffin The story of Deucalion and Pyrrha coming down from Parnassus after the flood and, without the marriage-bed, creating offspring from stones, first appears in Pindar.1 These stone people were, says Pindar, the ancestors of the Locrians, a race in central Greece. A fragment of Hesiod's HOIAI shows that Deucalion's founding of the Locrian people from stones gathered from the earth was an old story:2 f]TOi yag Aoxgog AeXeyow riynoato Xacbv, Toug pa note Kgovidrig Zeiig acj)0iTa (xri6ea ei5(bg Xexxovg ex AAOYZ noge AetwaMam. "For Locris indeed was the leader of the Lelegian people, whom Zeus, son of Cronos, whose wisdom is unfailing, gave to Deucalion, stones gathered out of the earth". It looks as if the similarity between the words for people (Xaog) and stone (kaaq) gave rise to a myth about the creation of people from stones. The Hesiodic fragment says that Zeus turned stones into men for Deucalion and by this transformation produced the ancestors of the Lelegian people. A fragment of an unknown epic poet, preserved by the scholiasts, also refers unambiguously to the metamorphosis of stones into human beings:3 £x 6e Xi0cov syBVOVTO Pqotol, AAOI 6e xaXeovtai. Homer had talked about men turned into stones, the opposite of what happens in the Deucalion myth.4 Hesiod is the first to mention Deucalion's association with the metamorphosis of stones into human beings. But there is no reference in the Hesiodic fragment to a flood and no evidence that Hesiod associated Deu calion's stone people with the aftermath of a flood. Farnell certainly appears to go beyond the evidence of the Hesiodic fragment when he says that it contains an allusion to Deucalion's flood.} The connection between Deucalion and Pyrrha and the flood seems to have been made later than Hesiod. Pindar offers some evidence that this was indeed so. After telling how Deucalion and Pyrrha came down from Parnassus and created men from stones (0/.9.41-46), he makes the comment, "Raise in their (sc. the stone people's) honour a clear-sounding strain and 39</page><page sequence="2">Alan H. F. Griffin while you praise the wine that is old you shall also praise the flowers of songs that are new (0/.9.47-49). He continues, "They say indeed that the mighty waters deluged the dark earth until by the counsels of Zeus a mighty ebb drew off the water suddenly. From these were descended your ancestors . . . (0/.9.49-54). "From these" may refer either to Deucalion and Pyrrha or to the stone people. It makes no difference in the present discussion because in either case we find linked together Deucalion and Pyrrha, their stone offspring and a universal flood caused by Zeus who wields the flashing thunderbolt. M. L. West points out (pace Farnell) that Hesiod did not mention the flood in the HOIAI either because he did not know the story or because he excluded it. "It came, of course, from the east, for it is nothing but the story of Ziusudra-Utnapishtim-Noah, transferred to the improbable setting of central Greece. On its arrival it was doubtless attached to Deukalion because he was the first man, at least in central Greek myth".6 The best known Greco-Roman flood tale is, of course, that of Deucalion and Pyrrha, and Ovid gives us the fullest version of the story. Apollodorus also gives an account of the legend in The Library which agrees in broad outline and in many details with Ovid's treatment.7 Latin accounts of Deucalion and Pyrrha continue to tell about their rescue from a great flood on a high mountain and their re-creation of the human race from stones. In Greek versions the high mountain is usually Parnassus (as in Pindar, Ovid and Apollodorus), but Hyginus chooses Aetna, and Servius, in one of his two accounts, chooses Athos.8 Virgil knew about Pyrrha's creation of the human race from stones. Silenus' song about creation moves from a quasi-scientific cosmogony to the myth of Pyrrha (hinc lapides Pyrrhae iactos).9 The story of Deucalion and Pyrrha was, it seems, the sort of story which a neoteric poet might write about, appealing to a Callimachean taste for the sensational and for subjects involving metamorphosis. It is interesting to find that Ovid, in book 1 of the Metamorphoses, follows the literary programme recommended by Virgil in Eclogue 6: an introductory cosmogony of a general, eclectic kind is followed by the story of Pyrrha and Deucalion.10 The causes of the flood in Ovid are (a) the depravity of human beings in the iron age, exemplified by the conduct of Lycaon and (b) the impiety of the giants whose lineage is linked with that of mankind." The linking of the giants' ancestry with that of human beings is as old as Hesiod.12 If we look at the Genesis account of 40</page><page sequence="3">Ovid's Universal Flood Noah's flood, however, we find an account of the Nephelim (giants) just before the description of the human wickedness which causes the flood.13 This juxtaposing of the giants and wicked humans is the first of a number of parallels between Ovid's account of Deu calion and the Genesis account of Noah. The similarity does not end there. In Genesis and in Ovid the role of the giants is to serve as an example of the increasing human wickedness that eventually provokes the flood. At some distance or other the version of the flood story found in Genesis lies behind Ovid's flood story. We can be certain about this because the Genesis account contains two different flood stories, the so-called "Yahwistic" and "Priestly" narratives. In the "Yahwis tic" narrative the divine name used in Yahweh: the "Priestly" narrative refers simply to God. The Ovidian parallels to the Genesis flood story reflect both "Yahwistic" and "Priestly" material. The Genesis flood account is a hybrid narrative. The "Yahwistic" and "Priestly" materials are very different in character and their differ ent characteristics find echoes and parallels in Ovid's flood nar rative. Something of the hybrid character of the Genesis 'original' remains in Ovid's account. The "Yahwist", for example, refers, in a very human fashion, to Yahweh 'regretting' the creation of man and 'grieving' at man's evil (Gen.6.6). Ovid's Jupiter also responds to human evil in a very human manner (Met. 1.164, ingemit). The "Priestly" writer in Genesis is less vivid than the "Yahwist" and more careful about providing precise details about the course of the flood. The "Priestly" narrative, for example, describes the wind which God sent immediately prior to the subsidence of the flood and associates the re-emergence of the mountain peaks with the gradual subsidence of the waters (G«n.8.1 and 8.5). These details about the flood are also found in the Ovidian narrative (Met. 1.328 29 and 1.344). In other words the cross-grained qualities of the Genesis flood narrative are also found in Ovid's account. The Ovidian parallels to Genesis are detailed and specific, showing similarities of theme, sentiment, motif, emphasis, tone and charac terization. Throughout the flood episode Ovid's Jupiter is dignified, resolute, concerned with right and wrong, and not without com passion. In the flood episodejupiter is much more like Yahweh/God than like the love-sick, hen-pecked Jupiter of the latter half of book 1 of the Metamorphoses. Ovid's flood story, like that in Genesis, is concerned with moral issues, with human wickedness, violence and corruption on the one hand, and with human righteousness on the other. Ovid's Jupiter has been cast in a biblical mould. The moral 41</page><page sequence="4">Alan H. F. Griffin seriousness and the ethical concerns and emphases of the Genesis flood account are also found in Ovid's. These similarities are hardly fortuitous: they are indications of indebtedness and of contact at some point or other. M. L. West points out that "Greece's oriental contacts in the eighth century were primarily Semitic'"4 and that . . from the first, Greece's face was turned towards the Sun. Greece is part of Asia; Greek literature is a Near Eastern literature".15 He suggests that the myth of the metallic ages came to Greece in the eighth century, finding its way from Mesopotamia to Boeotia (Hesiod). Although the flood story does not appear in Hesiod, it too, as West points out, came from the east into the literature of central Greece. This hardly happened earlier than the eighth century B.C. The parallels between the Genesis account of Noah and Ovid's Deucalion continue as follows: 2. Genesis describes mankind before the flood as evil, loathsome, corrupt and violent {Gen.6. 5-13). This picture of depraved humanity appears both in the "Yahwistic" and in the "Priestly" sections of this narrative. Ovid describes the human offspring of the giants in similar terms as contemptrix superum saevaeque avidissima caedis / et violenta (Met. 1. 161-62). Moral degeneration is also a characteristic feature of human behaviour in Ovid's account of the iron age (Met. 1. 127-50). In Ovid, as in Genesis, murder is one of the evils which predates the flood. 3. Yahweh was grieved at heart when he contemplated human wickedness (Gen. 6.6). So too was Jupiter (Met. 1.164 . . . ingemit). 4. God announces an irrevocable decision to destroy the human race totally (Gctz.6.13 and 6.17). Jupiter makes a similar declaration (Met. 1.188-89, nunc mihi qua totum Nereus circumsonat orbemjperdendum est mortale genus). Jupiter's decision is final (Met. 1.243, sic stat sen tentia). Sententia here describes a fixed resolve, a verdict that cannot be appealed against, not an opinion which might be subject to change (see OLD sententia 5). 5. God's/Yahweh's decision to destroy mankind is announced a a prolonged colloquy with Noah (Gen.6.13-7.4). Jupiter's decision is also make known in a long speech at a council of the gods (Met. 1.163 252). Brooks Otis rightly sees Ovid's concilium deorum as a "bow to epic convention and particularly to Virgil".16 Otis illustrates the way in which Ovid modernizes the topos in terms of contemporary Rome. But it also seems likely that God's colloquy with Noah lies behind Ovid's concilium deorum. A solemn announcement or discussion of the decision to destroy the human race is appropriate 42</page><page sequence="5">Ovid's Universal Flood to the gravity of the decision which is being taken and also highlights the fact that the Creator (be he Yahweh/God or Jupiter) did not easily or lightly decide to destroy the human beings he had recently made as the crown of his creation. 6. In Genesis the "Yahwist" makes torrential rain the cause of the flood {Gen.lA and 7.12). In Ovid Jupiter also decides to cause the flood by sending down rain from every quarter of the sky {Met. 1.261, ex omni nimbos demittere caelo). 7. In Genesis the "Priestly" writer describes how the waters above (that is, in the sky) and the waters below (that is, on the earth) burst their barriers (Gen.l A\). There is in other words a return to the chaos which existed before God "separated the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament" (GenA.l). Ovid's flood also combines the waters of the sky (Met. 1. 260-73) with the waters on earth (Met. 1. 274-92) and, as in Genesis, chaos returns. The hybrid character of the Genesis narrative is apparent in points 6 and 7 and has also left its mark on Ovid's depiction of the waters of the flood. 8. In Genesis and in Ovid the flood is universal and covers the whole erth (Gen.l A9 and Met. 1.291-92). 9. The flood wipes out every living creature — man, beast and bird — in Genesis and in Ovid (Gen.1.23 and Met. 1.304-12). 10. God sends a wind across the face of the earth before the flood begins to subside (Gen.8.1). Jupiter sends the north wind to disperse the rain clouds before the waters subside (Met. 1.328-29). 11. Noah's ark comes to ground on the mountains of Ararat (Gen.QA). Deucalion's skiff grounds on Mount Parnassus (Met A.311). 12. As the waters recede, the mountain-tops in Genesis (8.5) reappear, as do the hill-tops in Ovid (Met. 1.344). 13. Noah offered sacrifice to Yahweh when he left the ark (Gen.8.20). Deucalion and Pyrrha worship the Corycian nymphs, the mountain deities and Themis on Parnassus (Met. 1. 320-21). 14. Noah, Deucalion and Pyrrha are singled out from mankind as outstanding examples of goodness, integrity and piety (Gen.6.9 and Met A. 322-23). They find favour with God/Jupiter because of these three good qualities. Noah, Deucalion and Pyrrha are exemplars of what human beings ought to be like, that is blameless and god fearing. 15. Through Noah and his sons the human race is given a fresh start with precisely the same instructions "to be fruitful and increase, and fill the earth ... and rule over it" (Gen.9.1; 9.7) that God gave when 43</page><page sequence="6">Alan H. F. Griffin he first created man (Gen. 1.28). With Noah a new world order begins. In a similar way Deucalion and Pyrrha, with divine approval, create the human race afresh (Met. 1. 411-15). 16. The Genesis parallels to the Deucalion story are not confined solely to the Noah episode. There is also a biblical echo at Met. 1.363 64 (o utinam possim .../... animas formatae infundere terrae) of the second ("Yahwistic") account of the creation of man at Gen. 2.7. ("Yahweh God fashioned man of dust from the soil. Then he breathed into his nostrils a breath of life"). Deucalion was, of course, the son of Prometheus who had created man from clay:17 Deucalion expresses a wish to follow his father's example and in so doing echoes a sentiment in Genesis. 17. Noah's ark comes to ground on Mount Ararat (Gen&amp;A). At Met. 1.294 Ovid tells us that a survivor plies the oars ubi nuper ararat ("where he had ploughed until recently"). There is clearly some Ovidian humour here: the survivor is ploughing the sea where recently he ploughed the soil. Ships are sometimes described as ploughing the sea by Virgil and Ovid.18 But could there also be an allusive reference to Mount Ararat in ararat? It seems unlikely. Ovid's Greek source for the Deucalion legend almost certainly named Parnassus as the mountain on which Deucalion's raft came to ground (Met. 1.316-17) and an allusive Ovidian reference to the name of a different mountain (Ararat) in another version of the story seems pointless. Ovid's Greek source shows through not only in the choice of Parnassus as the mountain on which Deucalion's raft comes to ground, but also in the precise detail about the mountain's divinities (Met. 1. 320-21). The witty use of Deucalion's and Pyrrha's patro nymics at Met. 1.390 (riQOfiT]0Ei6T]c; = son of Forethought; 'Ejuht]015 = daughter of Afterthought) to contrast Deucalion's mental sharpness with his wife's slowness is also likely to be a reflection of the use of the patronymics in Ovid's Greek source. At times Ovid simply assumes that his audience is sufficiently well versed in Greek mythological genealogy to understand, for example, that Titania at Met. 1.395 means Pyrrha, and that when Deucalion talks at Met. 1.352 of his "ties of common race and family" with Pyrrha he refers to the fact that they were first cousins.19 Ovid has, no doubt, taken over genealogical references in his Greek source and reproduced them without considering that they needed any explanation in their new contexts. He was, after all, writing for a well-educated audience. Karl Galinsky describes the scene in which Ovid presents the 44</page><page sequence="7">Ovid's Universal Flood effects of the flood (Met. 1. 293-312) as "one of perpetua festivitas",20 The detection of humour and playfulness in this scene is not new: it goes back to Seneca who reprimanded Ovid for lascivia at this point in his narrative.21 It would be wrong, however, to see Ovid's flood description simply as a jeu d'esprit. E. J. Kenney suggests that the description may be serious: . . Ovid's wit may have a purpose. These incongruities — chaos come again — can be read as underlining an unspoken comment on the enormous injustice of Jupiter's actions, typical of the divine caprice that plays a decisive part in so many episodes in the poem".22 Kenney's view that Ovid is underlining the injustice ofjupiter's actions is hardly correct, but his point about wit is well made. Wit, and even humour, do not necessarily rule out seriousness. We can also compare Ovid's treatment of the universal flood with other accounts of the same event. Lycophron (b.c.320 B.C.), for example, talks in his Alexandra23 of the deluge hurling towers to the ground: Ovid borrows this idea at Met. 1. 290 (pressaeque latent sub gurgite tunes). But Lycophron seems to introduce a note of humour when he talks of whales and dolphins and seals browsing on oak and acorn and sweet grape.24 Horace Odes 1.2 is a serious poem in which Octavian is seen as Rome's possible saviour from chaos and from the return of the age of the flood. Yet in that ode Pyrrha is described as marvelling at seals pasturing on the mountain tops, at fish tangled in the tops of elms and at terrified does swimming in the deluge (Hor.C. 1.2.5-12). Proverbial ways of describing the impossible were considered by Lycophon and Horace to be suitable for depicting the chaos which resulted from the flood.25 Ideas which strike us as humorous in Lycophron's and Horace's accounts of the flood are, in fact, commonplace adynatoi or adaptations of them. Ovid has borrowed and adapted some of Horace's adynatoi. He describes fish being caught in lofty elms (Met. 1.296), seals pasturing where recently goats browsed (Met. 1.299-300) and a stag carried away by the flood (Met. 1.306). The incongruities of Ovid's account of the flood are, therefore, largely conventional and cannot be regarded (pace Seneca and Galinsky) as typical examples ofOvidian frivolity. The incongruities bring out the absurdity — and absurdity often has a humorous aspect to it — of a topsy-turvy world reverting to chaos. Ovid's description of what the flood was like includes a detail to which Seneca objected. "The wolf swims among the sheep" (Met. 1.304, nat lupus inter oves) is the only example of what Seneca calls Ovid's pueriles ineptiae. "Non est res satis sobria lascivire devorato 45</page><page sequence="8">Alan H. F. Griffin orbe terrarum" comments to po-faced Stoic. The wolf swimming among the sheep is not, however, a well-chosen example of Ovid's supposed playfulness. The reference to the wolf has point in view of Ovid's recent account of Lycaon whose evil behaviour brought the flood on mankind and who was himself transformed into a wolf with a taste for sheep's blood (Met. 1.233-35). Such cross-links are one of the means used by Ovid to bind together disparate stories into a unified narrative. Metamorphosis was not, it is implied, the only or final punishment inflicted on Lycaon: together with all other living creatures he drowned in the flood. Karl Galinsky argues, in the passage mentioned above, that in Ovid's description of the effects of the flood "there is no emphasis on death and suffering". This is not so. Ovid's sensibility is seen in the description of the bird which eventually falls exhausted into the sea because it can find nowhere to land (Met. 1.307-8). Ovid's account of the effects of the flood ends on a note of genuine pathos (Met. 1. 311-12): most living creatures die in the flood, but the few who escape drowning die a slow death of hunger. The sympathetic tone of this climax can hardly be ignored. There is more in this description than the humorous elements which Seneca and Galinsky highlight. It is rather a typically Ovidian blend of wit and humour, of literary reminiscence and rhetoric, of pathos and humanity. Ovid carefully introduces and sets the scene for the Lycaon episode with a short account of the gigantomachy (Met A. 151-62). This transitional section takes the narrative from the four ages of mankind to the story of Lycaon and also, conveniently, includes a metamorphosis (of the giants' blood into humans). Ovid's account of the giants is, in fact, the second of the two explanations he gives about the origin of contemporary human evil. The two explanations he provides are not really reconciled or reconcilable. The first explanation of mankind's evil is that the human race has degener ated in the course of four ages and now lives in the age of iron. The second explanation is that mankind has sprung from the blood of the giants. In Hesiod's Works and Days there are also two incompatible accounts of human deterioration (the Prometheus-Pandora myth and the myth of the Ages). Lycophron (Alexandra 1355-56) referred to the Pelasgians as sprung from the blood of the Sithonian giants, so the notion of human beings generated from giants' blood is not new in Ovid. Ovid emphasises that the human beings sprung from the giants' blood were a new breed of mankind by referring to them as et ilia propago (Afe.1.160). They are additional to the earlier creation of 46</page><page sequence="9">Ovid's Universal Flood mankind at Met. 1.76-88 and they inherit from their giant forebears three defects of character — contempt for the gods, fondness for murder, and violence. These personality traits of the giants and their human offspring are embodied in Lycaon who murdered a hostage and planned to muder Jupiter. It is fitting therefore that Lycaon's crimes should be visited with the same penalty as was the giants' impiety: Lycaon, like the giants, was blitzed by Jupiter's thunderbolt {Met. 1.230-31. cf. Met. 1.154-56). The mountains came down on top of the giants: Lycaon's house came down on top of him. The crimes and the punishments of the giants and of Lycaon are congruous. The metamorphosis of Lycaon into a wolf is also the first example in the poem of metamorphosis as down-grading. At Met. 1.84-89 the creation of man raised him above the other animals on earth. Now the process is reversed. The transformation of Lycaon signifies the return of humankind to the animal level. In fact it is worse than that. Men and women, as originally created, had something in them of the divine (Met. 1.78-83). Lycaon's transformation breaks the 'communion' between humankind and the gods. Lycaon's trans formation makes him an archetypical 'outsider': his newly acquired animal nature separates him not only from humanity but also from the gods.26 This breaking of the link between human beings and the gods is irreparable and anticipates the re-creation of humankind after the flood. Human beings descended from Deucalion and Pyrrha come from stone and have nothing of the divine in them (Met. 1.400-415). The bleakest consequence of the flood for the human beings who come after it is that there is no longer any relationship or kinship between the gods and humankind. Human beings survive the flood as a 'stone people', a cold consolation for survival. At the concilium deorum (Met. 1.163-252) Jupiter announces his intention to destroy the whole human race because of its evil. He bases this decision on his survey of human depravity which he experienced at first hand when he visited Lycaon's house. Although it does not seem immediately obvious the Lycaon story too has strong links with the ancient tradition of flood stories. Stories about the flood can be divided into two types — universal and local. The Noah and Deucalion stories describe universal floods. The Sodom story in Genesis 18-19 and the Lycaon story in Ovid both represent local versions of the catastrophe which followed the divine decision to annihilate depraved humanity. These two local versions also 47</page><page sequence="10">Alan H. F. Griffin concentrate on the evil of those who bring about the catastrophe rather than on the piety of those who win divine favour and survive. The Lycaon story does not contain any residual elements which betoken a flood, but the Sodom and Gomorrah story, to which the Lycaon story is related, does. At Genesis 19.24 Yahweh "rained on Sodom and Gomorrah" fire and brimstone from heaven. The verb "to rain", appropriate to a flood story, has been retained in the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. C. C. Bushnell also points out that the command at Genesis 19.17 to flee to the hills has more meaning in the context of a submergence story.27 There is the further point that at Genesis 14.2-3 Sodom and Gomorrah are located under water in the basin of what is now the Dead Sea.28 The parallels between the Sodom and Lycaon stories, showing that they are in some way related, can be set out as follows: 1. A report of evil doings on earth reaches the ears of Yahweh in heaven and of Jupiter on Olympus (Gen. 18.20; Met. 1.211). 2. Yahweh and Jupiter decide to "go down" to earth to check the reliability of the report (Gen. 18.21; Met. 1.212-13). The stories are theophanies. Yahweh and Jupiter are both conceived in a vivid, picturesque and anthropomorphic manner. Both decide to inves tigate a report of wrong-doing personally and to act on their findings. The "humanizing" of God which is a striking feature of the Yahwist's narratives (e.g. Gen.3. 8-19; 4.9-12; 11.5-8) finds a parallel at Met.\.2 \ Iff. 3. Jupiter arrives at Lycaon's house as late evening turns to night (Af^. 1.219). The angels of Yahweh arrive at Sodom in the evening (Gen. 19.1). It is not a matter for surprise that superhuman visitors coming to investigate human conduct should appear at the most inconvenient time of day for their hosts. 4. Jupiter was welcomed by the devout populace (Met. 1.220-21, vulgusque precari / coeperat). The angels of Yahweh were welcomed reverently by Lot (Gen. 19.1, "he bowed low with his face to the ground"). 5. The host prepared and cooked dinner for his guest(s) (Met. 1.226 31; Gen. 19.3). 6. Jupiter and Yahweh's messengers are denied their rights as guests: acts of impiety are committed against them while they are visitors inside their host's house. Lycaon commits two acts of impiety. First, he plans to murder Jupiter (Met.\.224-25). Ovid probably invented this act of impiety to make Lycaon's evil-doing as extreme as possible: there is no record elsewhere of this murder 48</page><page sequence="11">Ovid's Universal Flood plan. Jupiter's sense of outrage at the plan is nicely reflected in the way in which his reference to experientia veri at Met. 1.225 ("test of truth") scornfully repeats Lycaon's own words at Met. 1.222-23 (experiar verum). Secondly, Lycaon serves up human flesh for Jupiter's dinner (Met. 1.226-29). The serving of cooked human flesh to Jupiter in Lycaon's house was a traditional feature of the Greek story: it is found, for example, in Apollodorus (The Library 3.8.1). That Jupiter considers eating people to be wrong is pre sumably a reflection of the high value he places on humankind and his abhorrence of the unnecessary taking of human life. The men of Sodom behave impiously towards the angels of Yahweh by attempting what appears to be a homosexual rape (Gen. 19.5-8), though this behaviour can be seen as a gross example of a broader crime — inhospitality to strangers. 7. Sodom and Gomorrah are destroyed when Yahweh sends down "fire and brimstone from the skies" (Gen. 19. 24-25). Lycaon's house is blitzed by Jupiter's thunderbolt (Met. 1.230-31, ego vindice Jlamma / in dominum dignosque everti tecta penates). The Lycaon story ends abruptly with his punishment by trans formation into a wolf (Met. 1.232-39). It is a truncated version of a local "flood" story. It describes the divine punishment of human depravity (represented primarily as inhospitality to visitors) in an overwhelming catastrophe, but does not continue, as flood stories often do, to describe the survival of the catastrophe by a pious remnant who continue or create a new generation of men. The story of Sodom (which is also a story primarily about inhospitality, and not about homosexuality as is commonly sup posed) continues in the traditional manner of "flood" stories. Lot and his daughters are the sole survivors from Sodom and Gomorrah and we can see a hint that they were the sole survivors of the human race when the daughters say that "there is not a man in the country to come to us in the usual way" (Gtfn.19.31). Since Lot's wife has been transformed into a pillar of salt (Gen. 19.26) there is no possibility of perpetuating the family through her. Lot's clever elder daughter decides that incest with her father is the only way to perpetuate the family (Gen.\9.31-38). The Law of Israel, of course, condemned incest, but on this occasion it was the only way of securing the continuation of Lot's family. Even Yahweh, it seems, considered that the end justified the means. The elder daughter's son became the ancestor of the Moabites and the younger daughter's son became the ancestor of the Ammonites. Since the Moabites and Ammonites were Israel's traditional enemies we can read the story 49 D</page><page sequence="12">Alan H. F. Griffin of Lot's intercourse with his daughters as a gibe against these peoples reflecting the Law's traditional disapproval of incest. But Yahweh does not condemn the incest or comment on it. Some of Ovid's debts to his Greek (probably Hellenistic) source for the Lycaon episode can be identified, though we do not know who that source was. Apollodorus tells us that Zeus blasted Lycaon and his sons at Trapezus, a town in Arcadia (The Library 3.8.1). Apollodorus links the town's name with trapeza ("table") because it was there that Zeus overthrew Lycaon's table. The two references to a table in Ovid's account of Lycaon can be seen against this Greek background. The first occurs at Met. 1.165 where Jupiter recalls "Lycaon's disgusting table" (foeda Lycaoniae . . . convivia mensae) and the second at Met. 1.230 where Jupiter blitzes Lycaon's house at the moment the grisly meal is put on the table (mensis). The overthrowing of Lycaon's table by Zeus seems to have been a prominent feature of the Greek version of the legend,29 but Ovid has decided to omit it. The word-play on Trapezus and trapeza. is, of course, only possible in Greek and cannot be conveyed in Latin. Instead of overthrowing the table Ovid goes one better and over throws the whole house {Met. 1.230-31). The story of Lycaon also involves the verbal linking of his name with the Greek word for "wolf' (X1JX05) and his association with the cult of Lycaean Zeus on Mount Lycaeus in Arcadia. Socrates talks about this cult in Plato's Republic and reports the cult legend that "he who tastes of the one bit of human entrails minced up with those of other victims is inevitably transformed into a wolf'.30 Socrates suggests the analogy of a political leader who sheds human blood unjustly. "Is it not the inevitable consequence" he asks "that such a one be either slain by his enemies or become a tyrant and be transformed into a wolf?". We find here two of the major elements of the Lycaon story as it appears in Ovid, first cannibalism associated with Jupiter in Arcadia and secondly the notion of a murderous tyrant who is transformed into a wolf.31 The human flesh being cooked for Jupiter at Met. 1.228-29 is described as semineces ("half-dead" and therefore "half-alive"), a touch, no doubt of Ovidian grotesquerie. But Ovid is also employing a literary commonplace which treats food being cooked as still sentient. There is a nice parallel to semineces . . . artus in the story of Itys whose mother Philomela carved and jointed him "alive, and breathing still" (Met.6.644-45). Ovid then adds that Lycaon makes some of the human meat tender by boiling and some by roasting. Itys' flesh was cooked in the same way (Met.6.645-46). In both 50</page><page sequence="13">Ovid's Universal Flood cases the cooking method follows Greek sacrificial practice in which the viscera of the victim were roasted and the other parts of the animal were boiled. Ovid presented the preparations for Lycaon's cannibal feast as a parody of a ritual sacrifice in order to emphasise the horror of the murderer's criminal behaviour, but it is also possible that the details of the cooking, together with the overturning of the table, reflect the ritual of the cult of Lycaean Zeus. Ovid certainly wished to present Lycaon's impiety in the most extreme terms, as is shown by his invention of Lycaon's plan to murder Jupiter while the god was asleep {Met. 1.224-25). This plan is not found in any other version of the legend and was, of course, never implemented because Jupiter forestalled it by blasting Lycaon's house at dinner time. Ovid's mention of the murder plan, however, has the effect of blackening Lycaon's character further. Jupiter's thunderbolt overturns the house on top of Lycaon and his penates (Met. 1.231, in dominum dignosque everti tecta penates). There is nice point here in Ovid's mention of Lycaon's "larder" [penates is, of course, a food word). Lycaon's house and larder are the appropriate targets for Jupiter's thunderbolt: the house was the scene of the crime and the larder was the place where the human meat was prepared for cooking. Ovid makes no mention at Met. 1.230-31 of any other victims of Jupiter's blitzkrieg apart from Lycaon, but the reference to the fall of one household at Met. 1.241-42 (occidit una domus, sed non domus una perire/digna fuit) may reflect the Greek version, preserved by Apollodous, in which Lycaon and his sons were annihilated by the thunderbolt.32 The reason for the flood in Ovid is the depravity of mankind of which Lycaon's impious inhospitality is the most heinous example. Jupiter justifies the flood on the grounds that such evil as Lycaon's is endemic among human beings and ineradicable (Met. 1.187.-91; 1.240-43). Ovid seems to have been the first to link Lycaon's impiety directly with Deucalion's flood as cause and result.32 The linkage allows Ovid to concentrate starkly on the impiety of a single individual whose criminal actions have universal consequences. Lycaon's crimes do not only affect himself and his household. Since his crimes result in the annihilation of the human race Ovid needs to depict Lycaon's character as utterly evil. No crime could be more gross than a plot to murder the king of the gods. Ovid has designed the opening section of the Metamorphoses very carefully. The "Creation Epic" (Brooks Otis's useful expression) forms a continuous narrative (Met. 1.5-415). In the flood section of the "Epic" we can compare Ovid's accounts of Lycaon and of 51</page><page sequence="14">Alan H. F. Griffin Deucalion with parallel stories in Genesis. We can also say something about Ovid's use of Greek sources. It is possible to draw some conclusions about the way in which Ovid has organized his material, where he puts his emphases and what effects he is aiming at. First, Ovid gives great prominence and significance to the Lycaon story by making Jupiter the narrator and by linking it directly with Deucalion's flood. Elsewhere in the course of the "Creation Epic" Ovid draws attention to himself as the narrator (Met. 1.175-76; 1.204-5; 1.400), but here he records Jupiter's speech about Lycaon at the colloquium deorum (Met. 1.209-43) word for word. Ovid is merely the reporter. Secondly, Jupiter's speech leaves no doubt about the impiety of Lycaon. Lycaon's character has no redeeming features. He is a contemptor divum from the start (Met. 1.221). Like Erysichthon in book 8 of the Metamorphoses he is the personification of evil. His crimes are without motivation, mitigation or justification. He acts entirely alone: there is no mention of any others who join in his crimes or share his guilt. He is a murderer. He plots deicide. Ovid has increased the heinousness of the murder he commits by making the victim a hostage from Epirus (Met. 1.226-27). An obses is usually thought of as someone held as a pledge in war, but in Augustan times the word was sometimes used, as David Braund has shown, of someone who was little more than a student from abroad.34 The butchering, in the literal sense, of the obses from far-off Epirus, whether we think of him as a prisoner of war or as a visitor in Arcadia, was a gross act of inhospitality.35 Ovid makes it abundantly clear that Lycaon was the host, the butcher, the cook and the waiter at the feast of human flesh prepared for Jupiter. Ovid omits to mention any of the admirable facets of Lycaon's character (he was the founder of a city and of the Lycaean games) recorded in other versions of the legend.36 Ovid's Lycaon is a monster through and through. Only two human beings — Deucalion and Pyrrha — survive the flood. Lycaon personifies the evil and impiety which justified the annihilation of mankind by Jupiter. Deucalion and Pyrrha personify the goodness and piety which justify giving mankind a second chance. There is a contrast and a balance between the Lycaon episode and the story of Deucalion and his wife. There is not a great deal of human interest in Lycaon's character: his personality and behaviour are too extreme. There is more human interest in the character of Deucalion: Pyrrha's role and personality are secondary to his. Deucalion is devoted to Pyrrha and concerned for their joint 52</page><page sequence="15">Ovid's Universal Flood safety. He shows reverence towards the gods and anxiety about the survival of the human race. He reveals these concerns in a speech which Ovid has specially composed for him after the flood.37 His pietas is all the more admirable in that he considers that the lull in the storm may be temporary and that he and his wife still face the annihilation which has overwhelmed the rest of mankind. The Lycaon and Deucalion stories are both theodicies, designed to vindicate the power and justice of the gods. The concilium deorum focuses on the story of Lycaon: Lycaon is named at the beginning of the episode (Afe&lt;.1.165) and his impiety is the one item on the agenda of the concilium. Ninety verses (from Met. 1.163 to 252) are devoted to Lycaon. The next sixty verses (from Met. 1.253 to 312) contain the description of the flood. One hundred and three verses (from Met. 1.313 to 415) make up the Deucalion and Pyrrha episode. The Lycaon and Deucalion episodes contrast with and balance each other as the outer panels of a tripartite narrative whose central panel is the flood. The Lycaon is a story of impiety and its punishment: the Deucalion is a story of piety and its reward. The sequence as a whole forms the climax of Ovid's "Creation Epic". There is much humour in the course of the narrative, especially in the excursus on the topography of the Milky Way as analogous to that of Rome.38 The description of Iris going up with buckets of water to replenish the clouds in the course of the flood is really rather funny.39 But Ovid can be amusing in one line and serious in the next. Immediately after describing Iris keeping the rain clouds topped up with water, Ovid produces a magnificent tricolon to depict the havoc which the flood makes of the farmers' work: sternuntur segetes / et deplorata coloni vota iacent, / longique perit labor irritus anni.w As at 1.312-13 there is a note of genuine sympathy for the victims of the flood and a hint, perhaps, that not all human beings were as utterly depraved as Lycaon. The overall tone of the flood sequence is serious and edifying. Pietas is a virtue valued not only by Augustus and Jupiter, as Ovid tells us at Met. 1.204-5, but also, as the moral emphases of the Lycaon and Deucalion stories shows, by Ovid himself. The tripartite structure of the flood sequence of stories is Ovid's invention and it produces a balance between a story of impiety and a story of piety, a story of punishment and a story of reward. The contrast and balance between the Lycaon and Deucalion stories is 53</page><page sequence="16">Alan H. F. Griffin very similar to that between the Philemon and Erysichthon episodes in Metamorphoses book 8, as Brooks Otis has pointed out.41 In Ovid's flood narrative human beings are the source of depravity. Jupiter and the other gods stand aloof from human evil and are untainted by it.42 Divine indignation at man's inhumanity to man and at man's contempt for sacred things is to be expected in Genesis. It is somewhat surprising however to find that, in the flood episode, the moral character of Ovid's Jupiter can hardly be distinguished from that of Yahweh. The account of Deucalion and Pyrrha in the Metamorphoses con tains a number of features which we can identify as distinctively Ovidian and which set Ovid's treatment of the flood apart from that in Genesis. The first point is that Ovid emphasises that the sole survivors were a married couple. Deucalion and Pyrrha are the first pair of lovers in the Metamorphoses.43 They represent an ideal of married love which is distinctively Ovidian and finds its fullest expression in the story of Ceyx and Alcyone in Metamorphoses book 11. Secondly, human beings now owe their existence to this married couple and to no one else. Ovid has given three previous accounts of the creation of human beings — (a) by the Platonic demiurge from divine seed (b) by Prometheus from earth and (c) by Earth from the blood of the giants. But in the end he prefers the idea that human beings are the miraculous creation of the first married couple in the Metamorphoses. He makes the creation of new men and women by Deucalion and Pyrrha the climax of his "Creation Epic". Ovid's deepest instincts about human emotions were conjugal. His ideal was, it seems, a fruitful marriage. And yet there is something bleak about Deucalion's and Pyrrha's creation of men and women from stones. All the other versions of the creation of humanity have some link between deity and humanity: human beings are in a real sense the offspring of the gods. In Genesis too the 'breath of life' is breathed into man's nostrils by the Creator himself. The creation of men and women from stones, however, offers no link between human beings and the gods. It is also curious that the one Greco-Roman version of the creation of humanity which would have allowed this to take place through natural sexual intercourse between man and wife (Deucalion and Pyrrha) actually avoids this possibility. Pindar goes out of his way to stress that Deucalion and Pyrrha created their offspring 'without the marriage bed'. The story of the creation of men and women from stones is not without its dark undertones and curious features. Brooks Otis points out tht the Phaethon and Deucalion episodes 54</page><page sequence="17">Ovid's Universal Flood which Ovid puts in books 1 and 2 of the Metamorphoses "had long been associated with the two great catastrophes or Doomsdays, the Fire and the Flood".44 The Stoics taught the doctrine of the great year (magnus annus), the period it took for the stars to return to the position they occupied at the beginning.45 History consisted of an endlessly repeated cycle of such cosmic years and each magnus annus ended either with fire (exjruQtoaig) or flood (xaxaxXxJojiog). Ovid was certainly aware of the Stoic doctrine that the world would one day be destroyed by fire and he alludes to it at Met. 1.256-58. Brooks Otis argues that "Ovid saw fit to organize his first two books around the two catastrophes and their appropriate myths".46 Otis's argument needs to be modified in one respect. We do not have to wait for the first EXJiUQwaig until the Phaethon story in book 2. The Lycaon episode contains an sxjtuqwoic; in the blitzing of Lycaon's house. And when we remember that behind the blitzing of Lycaon's house lies, at some distance or other, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah by fire and brimstone, we see that exuvQWOig is not an incidental detail of the Lycaon story, but a crucial and integral feature of it.47 It is not unreasonable to see the blitzing of Lycaon as a reflection of universal catastrophe by fire, because Ovid presents Lycaon as the representative figure for the whole of depraved humanity and his sins have universal consequences. In Ovid's "Creation Epic" then the punishment for human sin takes the form of fire as well as flood. The two doomsdays of fire and flood are represented in the "Epic", but whereas the fexJTUQCDOig is limited and local the xaxaxXuoixog is universal. Fire and water are the elements which Jupiter contemplates using to destroy the world and mankind (Met. 1.254-61). Lycaon also used fire and water to prepare the meal of human flesh for Jupiter (Met. 1.229, aquis . . . igni). His cooking (which, of course, involved the destruction of human life) parodies the destruction of human life by fire and water when Jupiter punishes mankind for its evil ways. Lycaon's destruction of human life is evil, Jupiter's is seen as just. Oculi lucent has nice point in the final line of the Lycaon episode (Met. 1.239). Lycaon was destroyed by Jupiter's lightning flash (Met. 1.230, vindice flamma) and, as a wolf, his eyes "are alight". A trace of BXJtiJQCOOig remains after his transformation. Noah survived the flood because "he was a righteous man, the one blameless man of his time; he walked with God" (Gen.6.9). Ovid, less sexist than the author of Genesis, treats Deucalion and Pyrrha as equally righteous (Met. 1.322-23, non illo melior quisquam nec amantior aequi / vir fait, aut ilia metuentior ulla deorum; Met. 1.327, 55</page><page sequence="18">Alan H. F. Griffin innocuos ambo, cultores numinis ambo). As in the Philemon and Baucis story in Metamorphoses book 8 the piety, humility and goodness of a loving couple secure divine approval and favour. In the "Creation Epic" and at the mid-point of the Metamorphoses Ovid, so often characterised as shallow and lascivus, highlights the moral aspects of stories which are essentially serious and deal with cataclysmic events (Flood and Fire). His facility with words and his strong visual imagination mean that he cannot resist seeing the amusing side even of catastrophic situations. But a sense of humour is not, I suggest, incompatible with a capacity for serious reflexion and deep feeling. The epilogue to the Metamorphoses gains a new perspective in the light of the foregoing discussion. It is well-known that Ovid has modelled his epilogue on Horace's claim to immortality through his poetry in Odes 3.30. But Ovid's claim to immortality contains a reference to eJCJruQOoaig which is not present in Horace's poem and whose significance has not been appreciated. Ovid claims that the Metamorphoses will survive "the anger of Jupiter" and "fire", that is to say that the poem will survive the annihilation of wicked humanity at the end of the magnus annus (Met. 15.871-72, iamque opus exegi, quod nec Iovis ira nec ignis / . . . poterit . . . abolere). Now if Ovid was serious about anything he was serious about poetry.48 At the end of his magnum opus he makes himself the subject of the final metamorphosis: he is transformed into a book which will survive Jupiter's blitzkrieg at the end of the magnum annus. In the same way that the pious Deucalion and Pyrrha and the pious Philemon and Baucis survived the Flood, the poet Ovid and his Metamorphoses will survive the Fire. Flood and the Fire receive significant treatment at the beginning, the mid-point and the conclusion of the Meta morphoses: Flood and Fire punctuate the poem in the same regular way that they punctuate the historical process. Deucalion and Pyrrha survived through the miraculous creation of a new humanity, Philemon and Baucis survived by being transformed into sacred trees. Ovid will survive through his metamorphosis into a poem. Notes 1. Pind.O/.ix. 41-56. 2. R. Merkelbach et M. L. West, Fragmenta Hesiodea (Oxford, 1969), fr.234. 3. R. Merkelbach et M. L.

The long talk between Abraham and Yahweh before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 18.17-33) is an example of a solemn divine speech/discussion prior to destruction of mankind, such as we also find in the course of Noah's (Gen.6.13-7.5) and Ovid's (Met. 1.163-252) floods. Noah says nothing in response to God/Yahweh: he merely does as he is told. In Ovid the other gods who attend the concilium also play a secondary and subservient role to Jupiter: they are little more than an audience of yes men. By contrast, the dialogue between Yahweh and Abraham is remarkable because Abraham takes the leading role and has far more to say than Yahweh about the proposed annihilation of humankind. Abraham suggests that there might be fifty good men in Sodom and that Yahweh ought to spare the city for their sake. Yahweh agrees to spare Sodom if fifty righteous men can be found. Abraham proceeds to engage in a Dutch auction with Yahweh. Yahweh gradually reduces the number of good men needed to spare Sodom. From fifty he reduces the number to forty five, then to forty, thirty, twenty, and finally to ten. 29. Apollodorus, The Library 3.8.1; Hyginus, fab.\76; ps.-Eratosthenes, Cat.8 (ed. A.

In Apollodorus' version, however, the sons set the meal of murdered human flesh before Jupiter (cf. Hyg./a6.176). Ovid does not mention Lycaon's sons: Lycaon alone is the perpetrator of the crime, the victim of Jupiter's anger and the immediate cause of Deucalion's flood. Lycaon's impiety and Deucalion's flood are also linked in one of the two versions described by ps.-Servius on Verg.£c/.6.4.1. There may, of course, be Ovidian influence on ps.-Servius. 34. D. C.
