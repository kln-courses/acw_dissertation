MILLER* Abstract This paper examines the archaeological evidence of contact and English colonization in the Chesapeake Bay region of North America over a 150 year period, beginning in A.D. 1600. Algonquin Indians of the region responded to contact in varying ways, and data from domestic sites and mortuary contexts are examined. For English immigrants, evidence about settlement and ur banization, architecture, subsistence patterns and mortuary behavior is pre sented. The archaeology of the early Chesapeake reveals significant cultural interactions, and strong patterns of change over time in aspects of culture as different as housing, food and burials. These reflect a colonization process with initial diversity and experimentation, followed by selection and greater uniformity as a new society emerged.

One of these colonial encounters was along the Chesapeake Bay of North America. Located on what is now the eastern coast of the United States, early efforts to establish Spanish missions here gave way to the first success ful colonization by the English in A.D. 1607. Two colonies - Virginia and Maryland - were founded here and they became centers of cultural contact and ethnogenesis in the 17th century. Study of these colonial encounters has significance for the anthropological, archaeological and historical understand ing of European expansion and its impacts on both the American Indian and immigrant populations involved in that process. In addition to its formative role in the development of Colonial English society, the Chesapeake Bay region is the area where the field of historical archaeology saw its earliest major applications in North America. These excavations of 17th-century and 18 -century sites over the last century have produced an impressive body of archaeological evidence. This paper is intended to provide an overview of the history and archaeological investigations on sites spanning the first century of English colonization in the region. Chesapeake archaeologists have explored many research topics and the space available in a journal article is insuffi cient to adequately cover them all. Therefore, as a matter of practicality, a few subjects were selected that are of broad scholarly interest and may prove of comparative value. These are Chesapeake Indian contact, colonial settle ment and urbanization, architecture, subsistence, and mortuary behavior. To begin, a brief review of the locality and its history is provided. The setting The Chesapeake Bay lies along the east coast of North America and is one of the largest estuaries in the world (Figure 1). It is 320 km in length and av erages 20 km in width, with a maximum width of 45 km. A product of sea level fluctuations, the Chesapeake formed as the basin of the Susquehanna River and its tributaries were gradually inundated beginning 10,000 years ago.. As an estuary, fresh water from interior rivers mixes with sea water and creates a complex system of salinity regimes and ecological niches that sup port a rich diversity of aquatic resources. Numerous rivers and smaller streams flowing into the bay create an intricate network of navigable water ways that provide maritime access far into the interior. Most of the bay itself is relatively shallow, ranging from 3 to 15 meters in depth, but deep enough to provide access by even large ships (Pritchard and Schubel 2001:60-62). Mature forest covered most of the land and these were a mixture of decidu</page><page sequence="4">234 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 Figure 1.</page><page sequence="5">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake. 235 ous and evergreen species. The area has a moderate climate with no pro nounced dry season, precipitation averages 1000 mm (40 inches) per year, and mean temperatures are 3 C in January and 26 C in July. Abundant rain fall, moderate temperature regimes and fertile soils support a diversity of plants and animals, and provide good conditions for agriculture (Court 1974). The Susquehanna River at the north end of the Chesapeake provides the largest volume of freshwater to the estuary. The western shore of the Bay is dissected by two major rivers - the James and the Potomac, several medium sized rivers including the York, the Rappahannock and the Patuxent, and numerous smaller streams. The east side of the bay, called the Eastern Sho re, has several small rivers with limited water flow. All together, the Bay and its many rivers and creeks form over 13,000 kilometers of shoreline. One of the most significant natural boundaries is the upper limit of tidal action on the rivers, a boundary that corresponds with a geological feature called the Fall Line. This feature separates the Coastal Plain from the Piedmont geomorphic province. The Coastal Plain, in which the Chesapeake Bay itself exists, ex tends eastward to the Atlantic Ocean and consists of minimally consolidated beds of sediment. These create a relatively flat topography of rich soils that are susceptible to erosion and divided by wide streams. In contrast, the Piedmont is underlain by more durable metamorphic and igneous rock forma tions and displays a higher, more rolling topography. Where major rivers cross the boundary between these two geophysical provinces, the water elevation drops through a series of prominent rapids that is called the Fall Line. The rapids form a barrier to water transportation and mark the division between the coastal Tidewater region and the Piedmont. Colonial settlement initially focused on the Tidewater area, with occupation of the Piedmont gen erally delayed until the 18th century. This paper focuses upon the archae ology of the Tidewater region of the Chesapeake Bay. Human habitation around the Bay People have occupied the Chesapeake Bay area for at least 10,000 years. Indeed, American Indians witnessed the formation of the Chesapeake as rising sea level rapidly inundated the lowlands. Abundant estuarine resources slowly became established by about 6000 years ago and these attracted a growing human population. In A.D. 1600, Algonquian speaking peoples in a number of distinct groups occupied the shores of the bay. They had practiced horticulture since approximately A.D. 900 and possessed a keen knowledge of the rich terrestrial and estuarine resources of the region (Rountree 1989; Potter 1993; Miller 2001). Population estimates in the early 1600s derive from observations made by the English. The best current estimate for the number of people who were living in the Chesapeake Bay region is 45,000, with a population density of about 42 per 100 square kilometers (Ubelaker and Cur</page><page sequence="6">236 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 tin 2001:136). Different tribal groups inhabited the region, and many had reached a chiefdom level of organization. Along the James and the Potomac rivers and the Eastern Shore, paramount chiefdoms had arisen. The largest and most powerful was the paramount chiefdom of Powhatan along the James and York Rivers in Virginia (Rountree 1989, 1990). In Maryland, the Piscataway or Conoy chiefdom controlled an area along the Potomac River (Cissna 1986). The Eastern Shore chiefdoms, especially the Nanticoke, were mostly independent of the Powhatan and Piscataway (Rountree and David son 1997). Politically, the Powhatan dominated the southern portion of the Chesapeake up to the Fall Line, while the Piscataway controlled a smaller area of Maryland. There was conflict between the Powhatan and Piscataway, but a more serious threat for the Piscataway came from a powerful tribal group located just north of the Chesapeake, the Susquehannock Indians. An Iroquian speaking group, the Susquehannock conducted extensive raiding that had effectively depopulated the northern section of the Chesapeake by A. D. 1600 (hereafter, all dates refer to the A.D. period). The Bay was first visited by European sailors in the early 1500s but these were only brief contacts. The first significant European settlement effort was by Spanish Jesuit missionaries in 1570. Called the Ajacan Mission, it was probably located along the York River and survived less than two years. Al gonquians attacked the settlement in 1571, killing the missionaries and halt ing Spanish efforts at colonization in the region (Lewis and Loomie 1953). Just to the south of the Chesapeake, in what is now North Carolina, the Eng lish tried to establish a settlement in 1585. Called the Roanoke colony, it ended two years later with its inhabitants vanishing without a trace (Noel Hume 1997). England's first successful effort at colonization was in 1607 at Jamestown, Virginia. The Virginia colony underwent many trials during its first years, in cluding a "starving time" in 1609-1610 that nearly ended the effort. Arrival of new leaders, supplies and settlers corrected this situation and a viable set tlement emerged by 1612. The Virginia Company of London established the colony as a money making venture with funding provided by private inves tors. Originally expecting to discover precious metals and other riches, a decade of hard experience taught the colonists that the surest way to wealth in Virginia was growing tobacco. John Rolfe, who became famous for marry ing the Powhatan princess Pocahontas, obtained seeds of a sweet tasting tobacco, probably of South American origin, and tried growing it at James town. His experiment succeeded and tobacco production in Virginia rapidly increased after 1614 (Morgan 1975). Because tobacco sold for high prices in Europe, potential profits attracted increasing numbers of English settlers who occupied more land. Territorial expansion and poorly managed relations with the Chesapeake Indians created a volatile situation. There were several peri ods of warfare with the most serious being a well coordinated 1622 uprising</page><page sequence="7">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake. 237 by the Powhatan peoples that killed over one quarter of the colonial popula tion (Fausz 1985). Vicious retribution by the English decimated the Powhatan Indians, and after another 1644 uprising, the colonists ended Powhatan mili tary power. The 1622 uprising had important political consequences with the English king revoking the charter for the Virginia Company in 1624 and mak ing Virginia a royal colony. Growth resumed at a vigorous pace soon after ward, driven by the lure of tobacco profits. As a consequence of this lucrative export crop and royal support, Virginia became England's largest and most populous colony in North America. The most serious political disruption was a revolt in 1676 called Bacon's Rebellion. Named for its leader Nathanial Ba con, the rebels briefly overthrew the government, attacked and burned the capital of Jamestown. Royal authority was soon reestablished and James town rebuilt (Morgan 1975). But following another disastrous fire at James town in 1699, Virginia's government was relocated to nearby Williamsburg. England's second Chesapeake colony of Maryland was founded in 1634 and occupied the northern half of the bay. Having learned from the James town experience, Maryland's settlers established good relations with the Pis cataway chiefdom along the Potomac River. They peacefully acquired a Yaocomico Indian village for their first settlement, built a fort and named the founding site St. Mary's City. Unlike Virginia, this was a proprietary colony owned by a single individual, Cecil Calvert, the Lord Baltimore. What made it unusual is that Maryland's owner was an English Catholic, a group being persecuted in England. Maryland's existence is due to the royal favor in which Cecil Calvert's father, George, was held by the king. George served as a Secretary of State and member of the Privy Council for King James I until his conversion to Roman Catholicism. Calvert died shortly before the Mary land charter was approved in 1632 and the task of founding the colony fell to his oldest son, Cecil. This was achieved in 1634, despite intense opposition from Virginians who saw Maryland as a usurper of their lands. To avoid religious disputes with Protestants that would threaten the charter, Calvert applied the innovative idea of having no established state religion in Maryland, and followed a policy of "Liberty of Conscience" that effectively separated religious belief from government coercion. Despite many challenges, this new model of state-church relations succeeded and Maryland attracted the most diverse religious population of any colony in North America (Krugler 2004). Tobacco immediately became the mainstay of Maryland's economy, as it had in Virginia. Rule by the Catholic Lords Baltimore succeeded until 1689 when a rebellion associated with the "Glo rious Revolution" in England occurred. The new Protestant monarchs Wil liam and Mary made Maryland a royal colony. In 1695, royal governor Sir Francis Nicholson relocated Maryland's government from St. Mary's City to a new town he named Annapolis, a city that continues to serve as the capi tal of the state today.</page><page sequence="8">238 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 History of archaeological research Given their importance in the development of English America, Chesapeake sites have long attracted archaeological attention. Some of the earliest work occurred at Jamestown in the 1890s. Beginning in 1928, restoration of the 18th-century capital of Williamsburg by John D. Rockefeller included archaeo logical excavations to find buildings and collect architectural data. This archi tectural orientation was initially employed in the 1930s by the U.S. National Park Service in the exploration of Jamestown. However, those investigations soon shifted from a purely architectural focus to broader archaeological and anthropological goals under the guidance of Jean C. Harrington. Excavations continued at Jamestown until World War II halted research (Cotter 1958). Archaeology was also conducted at the site of Maryland's first capital of St. Mary's City during the 1930s and 1940s (Forman 1938). Simultaneously, contact period ossuaries were being dug along the Potomac River, yielding the first archaeological data about demography, mortuary practices and European trade goods associated with Chesapeake Indians (Graham 1935; Stewart and Wedel 1937; Ferguson and Stewart 1940). Another burst of ar chaeology at Jamestown occurred in 1954-1956 to prepare for the 350th an niversary of Jamestown's founding in 1957 (Cotter 1958). After this event, most excavations in the region were focused on 18th-century colonial sites. Beginning in 1957, Chesapeake archaeology came under the significant influence of Ivor Noel Hume, an English archaeologist hired by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. He employed meticulous excavation methods, greatly expanded knowledge of both colonial sites and artifacts, and played a major role in fostering greater public appreciation for the region's archae ology. Noel Hume's research reached a broader scholarly audience with two influential publications - Historical Archaeology (1969) and A Guide to Arti facts of Colonial America (1970). During the 1960s, important excavations were also conducted on contact period Chesapeake Indian sites, with much of this valuable work accomplished by avocational archaeologists associated with the Archaeological Society of Virginia. In the 1970s, a renaissance of 17 -century colonial archaeology began in the region. Rescue excavations were conducted at numerous sites on the Kingsmill tract near Jamestown by William Kelso (1984), Norman Barka and Leverette Gregory investigated the early Flowerdew Hundred settlement along the James River (Barka 1976; Deetz 1993), and museum-sponsored excavations under the direction of Garry Wheeler Stone began exploring various sites at Maryland's first capital of St. Mary's City (Stone 1974, 1982, 1990). In the late 1970s, Ivor Noel Hume turned his attention to the early 17th century Martin's Hundred settlement site (1982; Noel Hume and Noel Hume 2001), while along the Potomac River, Fraser Neiman conducted a detailed examination of the ca. 1670-1730 Clifts Plantation (Neiman 1980). These large projects generated a wealth of new information, and numerous cultural</page><page sequence="9">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake. 239 resource management investigations required by law began adding to the data base. In the late 1980s, the first investigations of the 1650 settlement of Providence in Maryland began and it has yielded valuable information about the architecture and material culture of Puritan immigrants who moved to Maryland from Virginia (Luckenbach 1995). New archaeological research began at Jamestown in the 1990s with Co lonial Williamsburg and the College of William and Mary conducting survey, selective testing and re-analysis of the old collections for the National Park Service. Entitled the Jamestown Archaeological Assessment, this multi component effort produced the first comprehensive archaeological survey of the island (Blanton, Kandle and Downing 2000), and included a r??valuation and testing of sites first explored in the 1930s and 1950s (Horning and Ed wards 2000). Finally, a major exploration of the portion of Jamestown owned by the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities began in 1994 under the direction of William Kelso. Named Jamestown Rediscovery, this very significant project has succeeded in identifying the earliest fortifications and structures built by Jamestown's founders (Kelso and Straub 2004). Through these efforts, a massive data base of archaeological evidence from multiple sites is now assembled and it affords the opportunity of explor ing broad questions about colonial encounters in this region. Good summa ries of various aspects of 17th-century archaeological research, as of 1992, are provided in Reinhart and Pogue (1993), and 18th-century colonial sites research is reviewed in Reinhart (1996). A bibliographical guide to colonial sites research in the Middle-Atlantic region including the Chesapeake is found in Miller (1996). Another asset for the study of this region is the avail ability of a substantial documentary record. Historical scholarship on the 17th century English colonists also flourished in the 1970s and 1980s (cf. Morgan 1975; Tate and Ammerman 1979; Main 1982; Carr, Morgan and Russo 1988; Horn 1994), as did ethnohistorical research that has greatly expanded under standing of the Chesapeake Indians and intercultural relations (cf. Potter 1976; Fausz 1985, 1987, 1988; Rountree 1989, 1990). There is growing in terest in the archaeology of colonial encounters (cf. Cusick 1998; Stein 2005) and recognition of the importance of comparative analysis of colonizing situations from both the native and immigrant perspectives. The Chesapeake region is an excellent study area for investigating these encounters within the context of an emerging Atlantic world. Contact and intercultural relations As the earliest location of sustained English and American Indian interaction, the Chesapeake was a foundational experience influencing future perspec tives and cultural relationships. The coastal plain region was the home to many Indian peoples, most of whom spoke the Algonquian language and</page><page sequence="10">240 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 lived in kin-oriented, ranked societies (Feest 1978). The rich history of inter cultural relations in the region is beyond the scope of this article but much ethnohistorical research is published on the topic and some of the significant contributions include Fausz 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988; Turner 1985; Rountree 1989, 1990, 1993; Cissna 1986; Rountree and Davidson 1997; Gleach 1997). English colonists entered an area with numerous, well adapted cultures, so me of which were in the midst of political centralization and expansion. The first group the English came into direct contact with were the Pow hatan, named for their leader the paramount chief Powhatan. This chiefdom already controlled most of southeastern Virginia along the James and York rivers and was expanding northward. English settlers came into conflict with this group due in part to the fact that they established their first settlement of Jamestown in the center of the Powhatan chiefdom. English military action destroyed the Powhatan but sustained interactions continued with Algon quian groups elsewhere in the Chesapeake (Fausz 1985; 1988). Initially, trade with the Algonquians focused on food in the form of maize. By 1630, maize was being superseded by furs, especially of beaver, as the premier trade commodity. Furs brought huge profits in England, and the re sulting competition for them in the Chesapeake caused much conflict be tween both the colonists and the various Chesapeake Indian groups (Fausz 1988). In this market, American Indians were the key players because they controlled the supply both as trappers and as middlemen to distant fur-rich regions. By mid-century, the Chesapeake itself was largely depleted of bea ver furs and efforts to obtain them turned to the north and west of the coastal area. The Susquehannock Indians at the northern end of the Bay became principal suppliers of beaver furs to the region for several decades. As the prime fur supplies dwindled, Chesapeake Indians turned to acquir ing the skins of less valuable species such as deer and raccoon for ex change. They also served as hunters, produced log canoes, made craft items such as reed mats, wooden trays, tobacco pipes and ceramics for exchange or became servants on plantations (cf. Rountree and Davidson 1997:137 138; Mouer et al. 1999). Few Chesapeake Indians were enslaved. Most of the enslaved people who labored in the early Chesapeake were of African origin. Although the ethnohistorical record of the Chesapeake reveals the broad outline of these colonial encounters, how these various cultures responded to and were impacted by the arrival of Europeans is less certain. As ar chaeologist Mary Ellen Hodges has stated, the key archaeological ques tions for the proto-historic and contact periods in the region are "what was Native American life like after European contact?" and what were "...the processes involved in Native American adaptations to their 'new world' which explain how and why native societies responded as they did?" (Hodgesl 993:9).</page><page sequence="11">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake. 241 Despite much archaeological research, identifying Algonquian villages of the contact era has proven more difficult than originally anticipated (Turner and Opperman 1993; Potter 1993). In Virginia, less than 15% of the total number of Native American sites indicated by documents and maps from the first decades of the 17th-century are identified (Turner and Opperman 1993:70) and a similar situation exists in Maryland. It seems that concen trated, fortified settlements were not common in the region. Rather, most villages were loose clusters of internally dispersed houses located adjacent to waterways on the finest agricultural lands (Potter 1982, 1993). Such a settlement pattern reflected the Algonquin's practice of swidden agriculture with houses distribute among the fields over an area of several hundred hec tares or more. These tend to be low density sites, making their identification difficult with survey level data. Compounding the problem is the rarity of Euro pean trade artifacts from surface collections and test excavations, the most conclusive proof of a contact era site. Despite these challenges, a number of sites occupied just before or during the early years of English settlement have been successfully identified. A good example is the site of Cinquoteck, a village destroyed by the English in August of 1610. Located north of James town, this was a village of the Paspahegh Indians, a tributary group to the Powhatan. Survey data gave little indication of a significant village in this location but large scale topsoil removal revealed the postholes of a number of structures and various features including burials (Hodge, Hodge and Luccket ti 1994). Only minimal European material was present in the artifact assem blage. In 2003, Virginia archaeologists make a major discovery along the York River - the main village of the Powhatan at the time of English arrival known as Werowocomoco. Abandoned in 1609, study of this significant site is beginning to yield valuable evidence about the political center of the Pow hatan. Along the Potomac River, several early contact era sites are known along the southern shore of the Potomac (Potter 1982, 1993) and at the Patowomeck site on Indian Point (Schmitt 1965; MacCord 1991). At St. Mary's City, evidence of the Yaocomico village acquired by the Maryland colonists in 1634 has also been found (Miller 1983). Later Algonquian sites from the mid to late 17th-century associated with the Piscataway Chiefdom in Maryland are known (Ferguson and Ferguson 1960; Ste phenson et al. 1963; Barse 1985; Galke 2004), and there are a number of contact era sites along the Rappahannock River in Virginia (MacCord 1965, 1969; Potter 1977). There has been some limited work on Eastern Shore contact sites in Maryland (Davidson, Hughes and McNamara 1985) but the most intensive investigations there are at the Chicone Indian Town site, where excavations are yielding insights about the changing lifeways of the Nanticoke Indians over a span of nearly 150 years of contact (Busby 2000).</page><page sequence="12">242 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 Anthropological insights about the impact of contact on the Algonquians may be obtained from considering specific items of material culture. One artifact of particular significance in this region is copper, the consummate prestige material of Chesapeake Indian society. It was the precious metal of the region and possessed high cultural value. Distribution of copper was strictly controlled by the paramount chiefs and local leaders (Rountree 1989). Chiefs and other prominent persons wore it in the form of large copper gor gets, plates, and tubular beads (Figure 2). Copper was rare with no sources existing in the region. It could only be obtained by trade with peoples in the distant Great Lakes region, in western North Carolina or through the Monacan Indians in the Piedmont region, a group hostile to the Powhatan (Hantman 1990). The only context in which it is typically found by archaeolo gists on prehistoric sites is with the burials of elite persons (Potter 1989, Curry 1999). It was used to display rank, pay tribute, reward achievement and maintain power. Copper served an essential role in maintaining hierarchy in these ranked societies (Rountree 1989; Potter 1989; Mallios and Emmett 2004). Figure 2.</page><page sequence="13">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake. 243 Arrival of the English changed all that, with copper suddenly being avail able in unprecedented quantities. Archaeologists Seth Mallios and Carter Hudgins have studied this subject and defined three periods in the first year and a half of English settlement when copper and brass virtually glutted Powhatan society (Mallios 1998). This availability increased as the English presence grew in the region and evidence suggest that copper rapidly lost its prestige value in the Powhatan chiefdom (Mallios and Emmett 2004). The cultural consequences of this were first suggested by Stephen Potter (1989), who hypothesized that the availability of large amounts of copper and brass disrupted a crucial means of status recognition and social control, and would eventually help diminish the authority of chiefs and werowances. Instead of availability being tightly controlled, individual Algonquians suddenly had the opportunity of acquiring copper and other goods in large quantities by direct exchange, especially with sailors who may have been a principal source of the material. Archaeological evidence that copper declined precipitously in value was recently found at a Powhatan-affiliated village known as Kiskiak on the York River. Test excavations recovered fragments of European copper in a trash midden dating to ca. 1610-1622 (Blanton and Hudgins 2004). Blanton notes that finding what had long been a rare prestige material mixed with domestic garbage strongly implies that copper no longer retained its prestige status for the Powhatan. Mortuary behavior is another aspect of culture through which the impact of European contact on Algonquian culture may be expressed. Potter hypothe sized that the decline in authority and social control would be most archaeo logically visible in burials, especially with grave goods (Potter 1989, 1993). Most Algonquians in the region initially placed the deceased above ground on scaffolds or enclosed platforms, although some primary burials in soil also occurred. The bones of elite persons were sometimes cared for in special mortuary houses but many people were eventually given a secondary inter ment in large ossuaries as part of a communal ceremony known as the Feast of the Dead (Curry 1999). Ossuaries occur throughout the region, but the longest sequence of excavated examples is from the Potomac River. Most of these are related either to the Patawomeke Indians on the Virginia shore or the Piscataway chiefdom in Maryland. In examining burials of the Patawomeke people, a group loosely affiliated with the Powhatan, Potter found evidence reflecting a change in mortuary practices. There are two early 17th-century burials associate with this group; a small primary burial pit with multiple individuals and a large ossuary (Potter 1989:162-165). The smaller grave held 12 persons placed in an extended position and all had shell beads, but only one individual, a male, was interred with other materials. He had large copper sheets, shell and copper disks, rolled copper beads, complete whelk shells, engraved shell mask gorgets, and a few blue glass beads. Clearly, he was an individual of high status in</page><page sequence="14">244 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 Patawomeke society. The nearby ossuary contained 181 persons and yiel ded quantities of shell beads and gorgets. Copper artifacts were also present, mostly in the form of tubular beads, but they only occurred with 28 of the 181 persons. Only six of the people were buried with glass beads. Potter inter prets this is evidence of a ranked society in which the authority of the werow ance remained intact and the distribution of status goods was tightly controlled. A later mid-17th-century Patawomeke burial held the remains of 10 persons who were all primary interments. Significantly, each skeleton had quantities of grave goods in association, including many shell beads, 40 brass bells, some glass beads, a copper chain and copper buttons (Potter 1989:166). This is believed to be an interment of common persons, pointing to a shift from mass ossuary burial for commoners to smaller burials. Regard less of their status, this grave clearly indicates there was a more uniform distribution of trade items among people compared to the earlier period. On the Maryland side of the Potomac, at least 20 ossuaries have been investigated, although regrettably few of them by professional archaeologists (Figure 3). These span a 175 year period from the early 1500s up to ca. 1680 Figure 3.</page><page sequence="15">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake. 245 (Curry 1999:72). Early to mid-16 century ossuaries contain the bones of from 131 to 648 persons but there are few artifacts in association other than small numbers of shell beads and ceramics. Later 16th-century ossuaries contain more shell beads and some copper artifacts such as tube beads. Four ossuaries from the Warehouse Point site date from the late 1500 to the early 1600s and all yielded shell beads, Marginella shells, and shell gorgets but only the latest two ossuaries having copper artifacts. One had 18 copper tube beads but Ossuary #4, dating to the first quarter of the 17th-century, yielded 80 copper tube beads, copper disks, triangular copper ornaments, and copper plates along with shell beads and several hundred glass beads. Significantly, analysis suggests that much of this copper is from Europe (Cu rry 1999.50). A similar pattern is seen in two ossuaries excavated at Piscataway Fort, the main village of the Piscataway chiefdom after ca. 1630. The earlier Clag gett ossuary contained at least 281 persons with some tubular beads of cop per, two copper pendants, and many shell beads but no glass beads or other European materials (Curry 1999:35-36). Strikingly different was the nearby Ferguson ossuary that held a minimum of 207 persons and the greatest quantity of copper artifacts found in any Maryland burial (Curry 1999:29). Among these were over 300 copper tubular beads, large copper disks, pen dants, tinkling cones, hawk bells and English brass jettons. Thousands of glass beads were also present, representing 12 different types, one of the largest bead samples from the Chesapeake region. Even greater quantities of shell beads came from this ossuary (Curry 1999:35). This burial probably dates from the 1640s or early 1650s. Notably, these grave goods were not clustered with specific individuals but were distributed throughout the ossu ary. Such a finding supports Potter's hypothesis that copper and other goods rapidly became widely distributed through the society as a result of direct interaction with the English and were no longer restricted only to the leader ship. While many stresses were impacting Algonquian society in the 17th century ?including serious population decline from disease and warfare? the devaluing of a prized material that had long been used to confer prestige and validate rank in the society was an unintended consequence that helped undermine cultural stability. A commodity of native origin that endured in importance for the Algon quians was marine shell. American Indians had valued shell for over 5000 years (Pendergast 1988:102), and the Chesapeake Bay region was one im portant source of it (Pendergast 1988, 1991). Beads and other shell artifacts made from hardshell clam (Mercenaria mercenaria), whelk shell (Busycon sp.) and other species are found in prehistoric burial contexts in the region. Although glass beads could have easily replaced those of shell, it appears that for Indian groups in the Chesapeake, shell beads possessed a strong cultural and spiritual value that was not transferable to glass beads. Shell</page><page sequence="16">246 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 beads are always more numerous in Chesapeake burial contexts than those of glass. Even in the latest Piscataway/Coney graves from the mid-18th- cen tury, the most abundant artifacts were shell beads (Kent 1984: 398). Contin ued placement of large quantities of shell beads and other shell objects in graves through time is compelling archaeological evidence that the spiritual meaning of shell remained deeply embedded in Algonquian culture. Availability of new European goods offered Chesapeake Indians many opportunities to accept or reject these items, or use the new raw materials in traditional ways. Documents suggest that among the items most rapidly ac cepted were woven fabrics, guns, and metal tools. Some archaeological evi dence is available from mid to late 17th-century domestic sites believed to have been occupied by Algonquians. Excavations at the Posey site in Char les County, Maryland found evidence of occupation dating ca. 1650-1695 with large quantities of Chesapeake Indian ceramics and tobacco pipes, along with brass and iron arrow points, copper decorative items, gunflints, wrought iron nails, and some European ceramics, bottle glass and pipes (Barse 1985; Galke 2004). It is notable that the faunal assemblage is totally from wild species, with the exception of few teeth from one swine. A contem porary occupation dating ca. 1680-1710 is the Camden site on the Rappa hannock River, about 48 kilometers from Posey. Excavators found large quantities of native produced ceramics and tobacco pipes there as well (MacCord 1969). Only a few European ceramics and white clay tobacco pipe fragments were recovered, reflecting a continuation of traditional crafts. Other objects of European origin include English gunflints, gun parts, iron knives, wrought nails, a copper bracelet, copper beads and scrap pieces, cast brass artifacts and a few wine bottle glass fragments. Only one glass and two shell beads were recovered. Excavators also found an arrow point chipped from European bottle glass, indicating continued use of this technology but em ploying a new raw material. The faunal assemblage here is composed totally of wild species (MacCord 1969:36). This is unlike any late 17th-century colo nial site known from the region (Miller 1988b) but is very similar to the faunal sample from the Posey site. Subsequent archaeological survey in the vicinity found eight other likely house sites scattered over a substantial area in the same internally dispersed pattern as observed on late 16th and 17th-century Chesapeake Indian sites. The Camden site is an Algonquian village on a late 17th-century reservation (Hodges and McCartney 1985; Hodges 1986). This evidence indicates that the Algonquians did not abandon their way of life or traditions, but selectively adopted or substituted European commodities into their culture. Similarly, the Nanticokes and Choptanks on Maryland's Eastern Shore remained culturally conservative and retained their way of life on reservations through the first half of the18th century (Rountree and David son 1997:156-159). Around 1750, due to English encroachment on their lands, many of the Nanticoke chose to migrate northward to New York and</page><page sequence="17">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake. 247 join the Iroquois people. Excavations at the Nanticoke village of Chicone support the idea that they retained much of their traditional culture into the mid-18th century (Busby 2000). But other evidence suggests there was variation in how the Algonquian's responded to European contact. While many maintained their traditional cul ture, as seen at the Posey, Camden, and Chicone sites, others apparently elected to integrate colonial practices more fully into their way of life by the early 18th century. One example comes from a household probate inventory of William Tapp, noted as the last chief of the Wicocomoco people in Virginia (Potter 1993:224-225). Dated 1719, the material culture listed in this docu ment is virtually indistinguishable from colonial English homes, with the ex ception of "3 Indian milkpans". These were probably Indian-made ceramics, but note that even they were in the shape of English vessels. Tapp owned livestock, books, and other household goods identical to those listed in the inventories of contemporary English colonists. A site of a similar nature was excavated near the mouth of the Rappahannock River in 1972. Called the Owings site, it was occupied in the late 17th to early 18th century and mostly contains a wide range of English artifacts along with quantities of handmade pottery. Originally interpreted as a site occupied by an African American mar ried to a Chesapeake Indian (Dalton 1974), reanalysis suggests that it was more likely inhabited by an acculturated Wicomococo Indian family, espe cially given documentary evidence that there was Indian-owned land in the area at that time (Potter 1977). This site is a good example of the difficulty Chesapeake archaeologists have in determining the ethnicity of site occu pants during this period. The interaction of people from diverse origins in this colonial setting, their acculturation and resistance, and the selective adoption of new materials and practices make ethnic identification a daunting task. On English colonial sites, two artifact groups signify ongoing interaction between the colonists and Chesapeake Indians ?tobacco pipes and ceram ics. Called Terra Cotta or Chesapeake pipes, these handmade, brown clay specimens generally date to ca. 1625-ca. 1670 (Henry 1979; Miller 1983; Emerson 1988; Mouer et al. 1999). They are very similar in form and manu facture to those found on prehistoric sites in the region, and occur in a variety of shapes. Decorations seem to be more diverse than in prehistoric contexts, and include animal motifs and numerous geometric designs on the pipe bowls (Figure 4). One common decoration is called the running deer motif, probably depicting the white tailed deer although other animals are also rep resented. An unusual specimen, seen at the lower right in Figure 4, depicts a human standing on the back of large bird, probably a Great Blue Heron. These pipes are found in substantial quantities on colonial sites, suggesting that they were made for exchange rather than being just examples of casual trade. In some features on early Maryland sites, handmade terra cotta pipes account for over half of the total pipe assemblage. Significantly, these pipe</page><page sequence="18">248 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 Figure 4. styles vary between the northern and southern portions of the Chesapeake. Pipes with facets and stars are most abundant along the James River but these are rare on the Potomac River, where the Running Deer motif is much more common. This geographic difference may signify manufacture by peo ple with different artistic traditions. Perhaps the most striking of these speci mens is an anthropomorphic effigy pipe recovered from a 1640s context at St. Mary's City (Figure 5). The second item of possible Chesapeake Indian material culture is hand made ceramics. Some specimens found in the earliest colonial contexts are identical to wares from Algonquian sites and unquestionably were made by them. But another type of locally made ceramic occurs on later sites and has been called Colono-lndian ware (Noel Hume 1962). It is a low-fired earthen ware of local clay, often tempered with crushed shell and displaying smoothed or burnished surfaces. Colono-lndian ware is very similar to late</page><page sequence="19">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake... 249 Figure 5. prehistoric and contact era Chesapeake Indian ceramics but often made in the shapes of European vessels, including cups, pans, bowls, porringers, and pipkins. Noel Hume proposed that it was manufactured by Virginia Indians who had been exposed to European ceramics. This pottery is found on a range of colonial and post-colonial Virginia sites dating from the 1630s up to the 1850s (Mouer et al. 1999). Surprisingly, it is not common on Maryland sites. Who made the Colono-lndian ware and terra cotta pipes has been a topic of much scholarly debate. Archaeologists working on plantation sites in South Carolina also find quantities of handmade pottery and they attributed it to African slave manufacture. Leland Ferguson suggested the name should be changed to colonoware as a more inclusive term, given this possibility (Fer guson 1980:23). Colonoware is also found on Spanish colonial sites in Flor ida, but there it is attributed to Florida Indians (Deagan 1983). In reference to Chesapeake pottery, James Deetz argued that "most scholars working with colonoware now agree that it was made ... by slaves" (1988:367). A similar dispute occurs with the tobacco pipes. Matthew Emerson proposed that the decorations on the terra cotta pipes were inspired by African artistic traditions</page><page sequence="20">250 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 and that nearly all of the handmade pipes were probably made by enslaved Africans (1988, 1994, 1999). In a rebuttal, a group of prominent archaeolo gists pointed out the strong similarity of the pipe forms and many of the deco rations on them to specimens from prehistoric contexts (Mouer et al. 1999). They argued that these precedents, the demographic trends in both African and Algonquian populations in the Chesapeake, the temporal distribution of the pipes, and geographic variations in their styles made it far more likely that the majority of the pipes were of Chesapeake Indian manufacture. For the ceramics, the only major study of Chesapeake Colonoware pottery concluded that while some of its features are found on African ceramics, most of these attributes also occur on pottery from Algonquian sites in the Chesapeake (Henry 1980). Archaeological research on the Pamunkey Indian reservation in Virginia recovered Colonoware vessels in good late 18th" to early 19th century contexts, showing a direct association with Chesapeake Indians and there are a number of documentary references to the Indian ceramics to bacco pipe trade (Mouer et al. 1999:86-88). Furthermore, ethnographic evi dence that Virginia Indians continued making pottery into the early 20th century also exists (cited in Mouer et al. 1999:88-90). While it seems likely that some pipes and ceramics were made by Africans or African Americans in the Chesapeake, especially in the18th century, the best available evidence suggests that Algonquian Indians produced the majority of these artifacts. In the 17th century, handmade pipes and ceramics appear to be the strongest available evidence of Algonquin-English interaction. The controversy gener ated by these humble but valuable artifacts indicates the complexity of the inter-cultural relations in the region and the challenges of sorting out ethnic origins and identity in the archaeological record. Within 75 years of the first English settlement, vast changes had occurred in the lives of both the Chesapeake Indians and English immigrants. Cultural contact varied by time and place, and a range of responses were made by the various Chesapeake Indian groups. While the maize and fur trades flour ished, Chesapeake Indians were critical players and controlled major aspects of the cultural interactions. But as these trades declined and disease and warfare ravaged their populations, the Algonquians also experienced a grad ual loss of control and influence. Colonial authorities attempted to restrict them to small reservations that were inadequate in size to maintain the Al gonquian subsistence system. These diminishing populations apparently found it more difficult to maintain their traditions and some smaller groups experienced cultural extinction. Formerly separate peoples merge together for protection and fellowship, causing a blending of cultural traditions. How identity changed and was renegotiated in these situations are important sub jects requiring much additional research. By the end of colonial period, the Chesapeake Algonquians had suffered tremendous cultural disruption and their populations had undergone a precipitous decline of over 90% from the pre-contact period (Ubelacker and Curtin 2001). However, they did not dis</page><page sequence="21">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake. 251 appear and a number of Chesapeake Indian groups remain in Maryland and Virginia today. Colonial settlement patterns on the Tobacco Coast Early colonial sites are more readily identifiable in the archaeological record because they contain distinctive artifact assembles that were completely new to the region. Study of the earliest sites in the Chesapeake shows the first settlers had a strong preference for occupying "Indian Old Fields". For exam ple, excavations at Jordan's Journey on the James River found a 1620s plan tation built on top of a contact period Weanock Indian village (Mouer and McLearen 1991; Mouer et al. 1992). St. Mary's City was a Yaocomico village site and the presence of cleared fields there was specifically noted by the settlers as a key factor in selecting that location to establish the colony (Cal vert 1634:21). Along the lower Potomac River, a strong statistical correlation exists between historic or proto-historic Chicacoan Indian sites and early English plantations (Potter 1982). These Indian sites and fields represented rare and valuable parcels of cleared land in an otherwise forested environ ment and were typically on the best agricultural soils of the region (Potter and Waselkov 1994). European settlers not only occupied Indian sites but ob tained valuable knowledge about soils and other settlement criteria from them. Archaeological survey data show that 17th-century English settlement was tightly focused on the waterways of the Chesapeake in dispersed habitation sites. Study of site location evidence from Maryland and Virginia reveals that three fourths of the identified 17th-century sites are within half a kilometer of navigable water, and 50% are less than 150 meters away (Smolek and Clark 1982). It is only in the 18th century that settlement spread into more interior areas. In overall distribution, about 46% of the sites are located along the larger rivers, 50% of the sites lie on the creeks and smaller streams, and only 3.5% are on the Chesapeake Bay itself (Smolek and Clark 1982). Strong confirmation of this site patterning evidence comes from a unique map prepared by Augustine Herrmann in the 1660s (Figure 6). It is a carto graphic masterpiece, not only depicting the rivers and creeks of the Chesa peake region with considerable accuracy, but showing the locations of individual colonial plantations and Algonquian villages. Herrmann indicated that all houses stood along the rivers and tributaries, with individual resi dences located some distance apart from each other. Their distribution shows a nearly identical pattern to that of the archaeological sites. Both data sources indicate a pattern of widely dispersed homes arranged directly along waterways. Chesapeake settlement contrasted strongly with that found in the English homeland, where hamlets, villages and towns defined daily life for most people (Horn 1994), and differed from other English colonies such as Massachusetts, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.</page><page sequence="22">252 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 Figure 6. After analysis of the settlement characteristics displayed by sites, Smolek (1984) identified the following selection criteria as the most significant for 17th-century English colonists: 1) adjacent to navigable waterways 2) high ground with good drainage, and 3) superior quality agricultural soils. In Mary land, there is also a very high correlation with fresh water springheads, and it appears this feature was a crucial variable in determining precisely where a plantation house would be placed. Some Virginia sites are also near springs but residents of that colony far more often dug wells for water, as attested by archaeology (Smolek 1984; Mallios 1999:22-33, 51-52). Thus far, no 17th century wells have been conclusively identified in Maryland but dozens are known from Virginia. There are many factors that influenced where people decided to live in the early Chesapeake. The first and perhaps most important is the intricate sys tem of rivers, bays and creeks that characterize the Chesapeake region. These served as efficient water highways for travel and transportation as well as providing valuable estuarine food resources. The Chesapeake's hydrology</page><page sequence="23">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake. 253 allowed large ships from European ports to literally sail up to most homes and directly exchange manufactured goods for the annual tobacco crop that was packed in heavy, bulky wooden barrels called hogsheads. This greatly influenced the development of a water-oriented settlement system in the region. The dispersed nature of the individual plantations is more fully ex plained by the land use system the colonists employed. Traditional English practice would be to cut down the trees and laboriously pull or burn out the stumps to clear land for plowing. In the labor short, forest covered Chesa peake environment, this was not feasible. Instead, the colonists adopted almost completely the Algonquian agrarian methods of slash and burn swid den horticulture with a long-term fallow system. Given the massive trees cov ering most of the Chesapeake region, this hoe-based agriculture was an efficient means of field preparation and crop production. The colonial agrarian system was geared to the demands of tobacco production, with about five years of tobacco raising on a tract, a few more years of growing maize and beans, followed by a long fallow period of 20 to 25 years (Craven 1965; Main 1982; Carr, Menard and Walsh 1991:55-58), after which this cycle could be repeated. From 16 to 20 hectares was required for each laborer to maintain this system and plantations therefore tended to be sizable. Most plantations in Maryland during the second half of the century were from180 to 240 hec tares in size (Horn 1988:148). Thus, the presence of an intricate network of water highways and employment of an agrarian system adopted from the Algonquians that requiring large quantities of land were major factors in cre ating the water-oriented, dispersed pattern of plantation sites in the Chesa peake region. By abandoning English practice and accepting Algonquian crops and ag ricultural methods, the colonists acquired a highly efficient and sustainable agrarian system. In essence, the English directly copied much of the Chesa peake Indian's adaptive strategy (Potter and Waselkov 1994). At first, Algon quians were able to avoid competition for land by relocating to more remote areas, but continual and rapid expansion of the colonial population made that only a temporary solution. In the end, the English overcame the Algonquians demographically while co-opting some key elements of their adaptation. One prominent feature of the Chesapeake colonies regularly criticized by Europeans was the virtual absence of villages and towns. This was in marked contrast not only to England and Europe, but to some of the other English colonies such as in New England. Culturally, the English saw towns and vil lages as essential for social stability and "civilized" life (Horn 1994). But in the 17th-century Chesapeake, only two locations ?Virginia's capital of James town and Maryland's capital of St. Mary's City? displayed any significant concentration of population, and even they were little more than villages with a few hundred permanent residents (Miller 1999). Direct access to ships</page><page sequence="24">254 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 meant that there was no need for commercial centers and a reliance on im ported goods meant that craft and industrialization efforts had little success. For most people, it was more cost effective to purchase manufactured items from Europe and focus their labors on tobacco production rather than engage in crafts. Only the needs of making laws, administration, and holding courts stimulated modest urbanization at the seats of government. Jamestown saw repeated attempts at city development, some by royal decree, but archaeology suggests that they never proved especially success ful. A grid planned settlement was laid out at Jamestown and impressive brick structures erected, including long urban row houses that are unique in English America. Despite their large scale, most of these row structures were apparently seldom occupied and had been built largely as speculative in vestments (Horning 1995, 2000). Royal governors made serious and re peated efforts to create an urban community at Jamestown and foster industry and crafts but met with little success. Government business and innkeeping were the primary occupations of the inhabitants, reflecting its role as a capital. When Virginia's government moved to Williamsburg in 1699, Jamestown was largely abandoned. Efforts at city development at Maryland's capital of St. Mary's City were equally slow and hampered by political conflict in the 1640s and 1650s. Only after 1660 did significant growth resume. As at Jamestown, government and legal services and innkeeping proved the chief means of making a living. But unlike Jamestown, archaeology indicates that St. Mary's never had impres sive brick row houses nor much brick architecture. It was mostly a city built of wood, with only four all brick structures, not counting a mansion build by Philip Calvert, Lord Baltimore's brother. This difference is probably a result of fewer financial resources being available to a proprietary colony owned by an English Catholic. With no surviving maps or detailed written descriptions, archaeology is the only means of learning what the city was like. A combina tion of survey, excavation, aerial photograph analysis, and remote sensing have identified buildings, lots, located the main streets and created the first map of the city. The historical record implies that St. Mary's was a haphaz ardly built settlement with little planning or order but archaeology is disputing this view. Analysis of the site map reveals that the major land and water en tries, the major brick structures in the city, and a central square were all inte grated. The plan was of two symmetrical triangles that met at the central square, with the principal brick structures ?a Chapel, the Statehouse, the Prison and an unidentified building (perhaps a school)? placed at the outly ing nodes of the triangles, precisely the same distance from the center of the square (Figure 7). Streets followed this double triangular design and dwell ings were built along them. Such a plan involves the use of symmetry, geo metric arrangement, perspective, and the placement of symbolically</page><page sequence="25">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake... 255 significant structures at the nodes of the street system. These are Baroque urban design concepts, the most sophisticated ideas of city planning that were available in the 16th and 17th centuries. St. Mary's was laid out in the mid 1660s using Italian Baroque ideas, implying that the city leaders were making an ambitious attempt to build an impressive capital for the colony, despite limited financial resources (Miller 1988, 1999). Subsequent research revealed that the surveyor general for Maryland at the time, Jerome White, was born and educated in Rome, the center of the Baroque movement in 17th-century Europe. This is the earliest known application of these sophisti cated urban design ideas in North America. Archaeology was essential for discovering this long forgotten effort to create a fashionable and symbolically expressive landscape for the capital of Lord Baltimore's Maryland. Figure 7.</page><page sequence="26">256 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 Architecture Architecture is a vital source of information about a culture and it is influenced by many factors including traditions, environment, wealth, stylistic influences, economics, and social status. What was the architecture of the early colonial Chesapeake like and how did it change? Did it display continuity with the current practices in England or was frontier architecture significantly differ ent? Scholars long believed that these questions were firmly answered. While all agreed that the first years of settlement probably saw construction of flimsy impermanent shelters, more substantial brick and timber homes were likely built as soon as conditions allowed (Morrison 1952). Many brick homes still stand in the region that were believed to be of 17th-century date and ar chaeological investigations at Jamestown and St. Mary's City in the 1930s and 1940s uncovered a number of masonry foundations, thereby giving cre dence to the idea that the surviving buildings formed a reliable record of the architectural character of the early Chesapeake (Forman 1938; Cotter 1958). Given this situation, it seemed unlikely that excavators would find much new about the architecture. When archaeologists began the intensive exploration of 17th-century sites in the early 1970s, all expected to find the ruins of brick buildings. Instead, excavators uncovered a baffling confusion of post holes and post molds on sites. If brick was present, it was usually limited to fireplaces or cellars. Some sites had postholes irregularly spaced in rough lines forming square or rec tangular shapes, while others contained large postholes precisely distributed at regular intervals defining obvious wall lines. All of these suggested a class of architecture not previously recognized (Figure 8). As work proceeded in Maryland and Virginia, it became apparent that rather than being anomalies, these wooden, post-supported buildings were typical. Called earthfast or post-in-the-ground architecture, this form of construction occurs on sites spanning the entire 17th century, occupied by both the rich and the poor, and continues into the 18th century. The presence of large numbers of nails along with documentary evidence suggests that by the 1620s, the roofs and some times the walls of these structures were covered by thin riven oak planks called clapboards. Although some had brick chimneys, many of these earth fast houses were heated by wattle and daub stacks, perhaps with a little brick around the hearth where the heat was most intense. Rather than a landscape graced by stately brick homes, the early Chesapeake was instead a land dominated by impermanent wooden structures (Carson et al. 1981). Time and other factors have almost completely eliminated them from both the land and from memory.</page><page sequence="27">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake. 257 Archaeology demonstrates that during the early decades of settlement, a wide variety of construction methods and architectural forms were being used, as colonists from differing areas of England built in ways familiar to them. And it appears that initially, they were selecting types that required less labor and skill to erect. The earliest examples come from Jamestown, where traces of lightly framed buildings have been found (Deetz 2002; Kelso and Straube 2004). Other structures dating from the first three dec ades have been excavated at Kingsmill (Kelso 1984), Flowerdew Hundred by Norman Barka, Martin's Hundred (Noel Hume 1982, 2001), Jordan's Journey (McLearen and Mouer 1993, 1994), the Buck site (Mallios1999), the Sandys site (Mallios 2000) and Hampton (Edwards 1989), among others. The earliest type at Jamestown required minimal skilled carpentry and featured irregularly spaced posts with mud walls and lightly framed roofs, probably covered with thatch. Eric Deetz argues that the precedent for these buildings is a post and mud wall construction tradition deriving from Lincolnshire, England (Deetz 2002). Garry Stone notes other influ ences from medieval timber framing traditions (2004). This earthfast archi tecture was used even by the wealthy in the early Chesapeake. One example is the mid-17th-century home of Thomas Pettus (see Figure 11), one of Virginia's elite and a member of the powerful Governor's Council (Kelso 1984). Not all early buildings were insubstantially built earthfast structures, however. One is a house using imported stones for its foundation that was uncovered at Flowerdew Hundred and dates from the 1620s (Barka 1976). Another example is the St. John's house, constructed at St. Mary's City in 1638 by the first secretary of state for the colony, John Lewger. It had cobble stone foundations that supported a story and a half wooden structure assembled with expensive mortise and tenon joints (Stone 1982). A central "H" shaped brick chimney divided the house into two rooms and a unique stone lined cellar was installed under the east end of the structure (Figure 9). St. John's is essentially a southeast England farmhouse erected in early Maryland, showing no adaptive response to the new environment (Stone 1974, 1982). Given high frontier labor costs, it represented an exceptional investment few settlers could afford and was probably meant as a social statement about Lewger's high political status. It is significant that all later buildings and additions at St. John's, even those erected by Cecil Calvert's son, Charles Calvert, relied upon post-in the-ground construction methods.</page><page sequence="28">258 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 Figure 9.</page><page sequence="29">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake. 259 The variety of building types and forms used in the first decades of colo nial settlement reflects the varied origins of the immigrants but also repre sents adaptive experimentation to find the most suitable building methods from the universe of possibilities. England in the 17th century had pronounced regional differences in lifeways, and its architecture varied considerably, re flecting local climate, traditions, and the availability of building materials (Brunskill 1992). In the medieval and early post-medieval times, before timber shortages became a serious problem, construction methods employing wood were widely used in England (Mercer 1975). By the late 16th century, as quality timber became increasingly scarce, stone and brick were more com monly employed, at least for the better buildings. Late medieval timber fram ing practices continued being used for the erection of temporary agricultural and industrial buildings (Stone 2004), and this knowledge remained in the repertoire of some of the carpenters coming to America. The early colonists quickly adjusted to new conditions in both the natural and social environment of the Chesapeake. Unlike in England, the Tidewater Chesapeake has little good building stone, but the land was covered with magnificent mature forests, making timber the most readily available building material. This new natural environment also presented architectural problems unknown in England. Most serious of these was the termite, along with soil fungus and intense summer thunderstorms. Learning about these took time, especially the termites. Lack of such knowledge may be one reason why builders often put sills, wall studs and even floor joists in trenches or holes in the ground, directly in contact with the soil and thus readily available for the insatiable appetites of termites. Finally, historians have identified factors that influenced architectural choice, including very high labor costs on the frontier that were double or triple those in the homeland, a shortage of skilled labor, high death rates and short life expectancy (Walsh and Menard 1974; Carson et al. 1981; Carr, Menard and Walsh 1991). These factors rapidly drove development of Chesapeake architecture along its evolutionary trajectory. Based on archaeological and architectural evidence, Garry Wheeler Stone has classified the architectural evolution on the Chesapeake frontier into three phases (2004). The first phase between 1607 and ca. 1640 involved experimentation with a variety of traditional op tions and discard of the least suitable forms of architecture. By the second phase (1640s to ca.1680), colonists developed and improved a building type called the "Virginia House". It featured large posts and above ground sills to better withstand termites, often used a regular three meter bay system, and had a lighter roofing system. Thatch and bark roofs and mud walls were largely abandoned for durable and efficiently produced oak clapboards. By this time, builders had identified the superior species of wood that better re sisted rot and termites. Remains of these structures are found on sites</page><page sequence="30">260 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 throughout Maryland and Virginia (cf. Neiman 1980; Kelso 1984; Edwards et al. 1989; Outlaw and Friedlander 1989; Luccketti 1990). The final phase ?architectural refinement? lasted from ca. 1680 to ca. 1725 and included further efforts to increase longevity while reducing the labor costs of construction (Stone 2004:315). Colonial carpenters modified and developed a roof assembly that was strong, fast to assemble, and elimi nated most of the costly mortise and tenon joinery of traditional English roof ing systems. Advantages of these earthfast structures were that they required less highly skilled labor to build, utilized the most abundant construction ma terial in the region, were cost effective and lasted about as long as a colonist could expect to live (20 to 25 years) (Carson et al. 1981). Stone summarizes the flaws and advantages of these houses with a succinct quip - "The Roof Leaked but the Price was Right" (2004). Figure 10 shows a reconstruction of a Chesapeake earthfast house, based on archaeological evidence. Most of these houses were not large, with typical sizes ranging from 3x5 meters to 6 12 meters. Archaeology, documentary evidence and surviving structures indicate that earthfast construction continued being used for the homes of middling and poor families, as well enslaved Africans, in the 18th century, and for tobacco barns into the mid-19th century.

The first brick house at Jamestown may have been erected by Richard Kemp in 1639 (Horning 1995, 2000:62). In the second half of the century, much brick construction occurred at Jamestown, including long urban row houses that were modeled on contemporary English architec tural practices (Horning 1995; Bragdon, Chappell and Graham 1993). James town had the greatest concentration of brick architecture found in the entire Chesapeake region during the 1600s, and the largest of these structures was the Ludwell Statehouse complex, designated Structure 144. Built after 1662 in six components, its final size was nearly 74 meters in length (Carson et al. 2002; Kelso and Straube 2004). In the mid-17th-century, brick or brick and timber homes began to be erected in small numbers throughout the region, including the 1662 Page house (Metz et al. 1998) and the surviving 1665 Bacon's Castle in Virginia, and Charles Calvert's ca. 1670 home of Mat tapany in Maryland (King and Chaney 1999). The most impressive 17th-century domestic architecture currently known from the region is Arlington on Virginia's Eastern Shore and St. Peter's at St. Mary's City. Arlington stood near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay and was built by the Custis family in the early 1670s. It was a three story tall brick edifice with a ground plan measuring 16.46 meters by 13.2 meters and fea tured elaborate decoration on its exterior walls (Luccketti 1999). Chancellor Philip Calvert, brother of Lord Baltimore, built St. Peter's at St. Mary's City in 1677-78. It was a two story structure with a full basement and a square build ing plan measuring 16.4 meters on a side (Riordan 1997, 2004:347). It had a hipped roof, the earliest example of this architectural form in the region. These buildings represent the vanguard of elite brick mansions that have come to symbolize the plantation society of the 18th-century Chesapeake. Public buildings made from brick were mostly statehouses or churches, although St. Mary's City had a brick jail. Anglican churches built in Virginia during the second half of the 17th century tended to have rectangular ground plans, walls supported by brick buttresses and a substantial tower at the en tryway (Upton 1986). The only major Catholic church here or elsewhere in English America was the Brick Chapel at St. Mary's City. It was the first ma sonry structure in Maryland, erected by the Jesuits in the mid-1660s near or on top of the ruins of an earlier wooden chapel (Riordan et al. 1993). Its ground plan was in the shape of a Latin cross with substantial brick founda tions 1 meter wide and 1.8 meters deep. Economics, adaptation, cultural origins and many other factors influence architecture and the early Chesapeake offers a good laboratory to more fully elucidate these influences. Fraser Neiman applies evolutionary princi ples of selection and modification in an effort to explain the patterns dis played by architecture and site spatial usage through time (Neiman 1990,</page><page sequence="32">262 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 1993). For example, analysis of one aspect of architecture - building plans - reveals that a variety of room arrangements were used in structures during the 17th century but this variation was reduced to a common form by the early 18th-century, generally consisting of a rectangular plan featuring two rooms, a chimney at each gable end, and an exterior entry directly into one room. Changing labor relations and control of domestic space are found to be important factors in this selection process; a major transition from inden tured servants to enslaved Africans as the source of labor was underway in the Chesapeake between the 1680s and ca. 1715 (Menard 1977). Archaeology has revealed a virtually lost architectural tradition in the Che sapeake and rewritten scholarly understanding of its development. The most practical construction material was employed using methods and concepts derived from a medieval tradition and modified to suit the new natural, eco nomic, and cultural features of the early Chesapeake. The discovery of earth fast architecture is a powerful refutation of the tendency to assume that surviving buildings accurately reflect the past. Architectural survivors are usually the most substantially built examples and while valuable, they offer a biased sample of the dwellings that once stood in an area. The many stand ing homes in the Chesapeake claimed to be of 17th-century date did not match the archaeological findings. Subsequent dendrochronology analysis to resolve this puzzle found that nearly all of these structures were actually built in the 18th century (Heikkenenn and Edwards 1983). Without the insights provided by archaeology, the nature of the built environment in the early Chesapeake would be completely misunderstood. Colonial subsistence patterns Subsistence is another vital aspect of the adaptive process in colonization. English colonists brought European foodway traditions to the Chesapeake, where they encountered a new natural environment and people with unfamil iar foods and different foodway traditions. Documents indicate that maize or "Indian corn" almost immediately replaced European grains in the emerging colonial foodways and indicates that other American crops such as beans, squash, and sweet potatoes were soon incorporated into the new diet (Spen cer 1982). Unfortunately, the amount of archaeological floral analysis is cur rently insufficient to provide a comprehensive view of the vegetable diet. Study of animal remains is more advanced and provides a detailed view of subsistence regarding animal resources. Samples of faunal materials from 25 households in the region were assembled and divided into three phases for study: 1) 1615-1660, 2) 1660-1700, and 3) 1700-1745 (Miller 1984, 1988b). Since the 1980s, the number of archaeological faunal samples has nearly doubled, helping refine our understanding of broad patterns and giving</page><page sequence="33">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake. 263 better insights regarding variability (Bowen 1996; Walsh, Martin and Bowen 1997). Analysis reveals pronounced changes in the diet over time. Faunal samples from the earliest phase show that domestic cattle (Sos taurus) and swine (Sus scrofa) were significant food sources from the begin ning. This was not the case for sheep or goat (Ovis aries or Capri hirca). There is a paucity of sheep bone in comparison to English sites, where this species is usually common. Seventeenth century accounts suggest that predators, especially the gray wolf (Canis lupus) and gray fox (Urocyon cine reoargenteus), were major problems (Miller 1984). Although careful shep herding could have reduced the predator threat, scarce labor on the frontier and the absence of good grass in the forested setting made sheep raising an unprofitable activity. Goats were apparently never present in large numbers in the region. Wild animal usage in the first period was substantial, with white tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) the largest wild mammal species exploited. Wealthy households tended to have the greatest usage of deer, probably due to their hiring Algonquian Indians as hunters. Smaller game hunted or trapped in clude raccoon (Procyon lotor), opossum (Didelphis marsupialis) and gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), along with the collection of woodland box tur tles (Terrapene Carolina). Among the diversity of wild waterfowl hunted were Canada geese (Brenta Canadensis), many types of ducks, teals, and an occasional cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus). From the woodlands, hunters took turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), quail (Colinus virginianus) and a few pas senger pigeons (Ectopistes migratorius) (Miller 1984). Fish were heavily utilized by settlers during the early period, along with oysters (crassostrea virginica), blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) and occa sionally aquatic turtles (Miller 1984). Comparison of faunal assemblages reveals pronounced geographical variations in fish species. Chesapeake Bay displays a strong salinity gradient from high salt levels of ocean water at its mouth to nearly freshwater along the upper reaches of the rivers and this directly influences species distributions. On sites in low salinity zones along the upper portions of the rivers, common species are catfish (Ictalurus sp) and longnosed gar (Lepisosteus osseus) along with anadromous or semi anadromous species such as Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser sturio), Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) and White Perch (Morone americana). Sturgeons are especially abundant in early contexts at Jamestown and were the largest fish available in that area; a mature sturgeon could weigh hundreds of kilos. They would enter the upper river areas in the springtime to spawn. Sites in higher salinity zones nearer to or along the Chesapeake also yield anadromous species such as the striped bass but have fewer sturgeon remains. Instead, they contain large numbers of bones from a range of bottom feeding species like the black drum (Pogonias cromis) and red drum (Scianops ocellata), with the most abundant species being the sheepshead (Archosargus probato</page><page sequence="34">264 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 cephalus) (Miller 1984, 1988b). All of these fish prefer higher salinity regimes. Overall, it appears that fish were somewhat more important in the diet of colonists living closer to the Chesapeake itself, and less significant for people living further up the rivers. Evaluation of the relative significance of various animals in the diet is jud ged by estimating the meat weights each species provided. Note that many of these studies were made using the minimum number of individuals and meat weight method, and were conducted before biomass estimation meth ods using bone weight were available. Analysis reveals that in the early phase, cattle were the most important animal, averaging 44% of the available meat (range 25% to 57%). Swine accounted for 21.7%, with a ranged from 11% to 40% of the estimated available meat (Miller 1984, 1988b). Cattle was clearly the most significant single species and this finding challenges a long standing conclusion of historians that swine had the central role in the early colonial diet (Cummings 1940; Craven 1949:212). One wealth related differ ence observed in the early phase is that poorer tenant households consumed more pork than owner occupied plantations, although beef was still the most important meat for both. Deer meat in the faunal samples ranges from 6% to 31% of the total estimated, with the highest figures strongly associated with elite households. Fish consumption is even more variable, with aquatic con tributions ranging from less than 1% at a site on the Upper James River to nearly 30% at sites near the Chesapeake Bay. These differences seem to relate to ecology and varying adaptive strategies. People living adjacent to the actual Bay apparently developed a distinctive adaptation that incorpo rated fish in a more significant way than did other English colonists. Evidence from early sites suggests that the meat diet had pronounced seasonal variations. These data derive from discrete trash-filled pits that were deposited over relatively brief spans and date to the same general period. The presence of seasonal indicators such as migratory waterfowl, fish, and crab and stratigraphie evidence permits the season of deposition to be esti mated. Study of these discrete assemblages from the ca. 1615-1660 phase reveals striking differences in bone content and meat estimates, and sea sonal analysis indicates that these pits were filled at different times of the year. The evidence suggests that the annual subsistence cycle of the early colonists was based on domestic beef and pork in the winter, with some deer, oysters and small game consumed. To these were added migratory water fowl and fish in the spring. As spring gave way to summer, colonists relied more on wild species, with fish especially prominent. Heavy use of wild re sources continued into the autumn, when migratory birds were again con sumed. In November and December, when cold weather conditions returned, colonists slaughtered domestic species and the diet shifted back to a reliance on beef and pork. Aside from the domestic animals, this seasonal cycle has many similarities to that of the Algonquians. As with food crops, agrarian</page><page sequence="35">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake. 265 methods and settlement patterns, it seems likely that the English immigrants also incorporated elements of the Chesapeake Indian's subsistence strategy regarding animal resources. To summarize, the colonial diet during the first half of the 1600s relied primarily on domestic species, but a diversity of wild species was also ex ploited with a subsistence strategy that was highly eclectic. Non-domestic animals accounted for up to 40% of the total estimated available meat. Utiliz ing a range of resources by the early colonists instead of focusing on only a few foods is understandable from an adaptive perspective. Reliance on many different food sources would provide greater nutritional security in a little known or uncertain environment, where the failure or decline of some re sources could be compensated for with other foods. This is in keeping with a focal-diffuse subsistence model proposed by Cleland (1976). It predicts that a wider, more diffuse subsistence pattern has an adaptive advantage in poorly known environmental situations, as is often the case in the early stages of colonization. Did this subsistence pattern continue into the late 17th century? Faunal evidence from sites inhabited ca. 1660-1700 indicates that significant chan ges were occurring. One is a substantial rise in beef consumption. The aver age cattle contribution increased from 44% in the first phase to 65% during this time (Miller 1984; Walsh, Martin and Bowen 1997). Pork consumption continued with little change, making up about 23% of the total available meat. Domestic fowl occur in low but persistent quantities through all phases. Dur ing this second period, sheep become more common, as indicated in both the archaeological and documentary records but they rarely contribute more than 5% of the total available meat. Their greater presence is probably due to a successful effort to eliminate the wolf population, development of pastures, and less severe labor shortages in the later 1600s. At the same time, colo nists were consuming less meat from wild sources. Deer, small mammals, and waterfowl were still hunted and fish taken, but the contribution of all wild species seldom exceeds 10% of the total. Overall, there is much greater uni formity appearing between the faunal samples. Surprisingly, comparison of wealthy planter assemblages with those from tenant sites reveals little varia tion, suggesting that meat was readily available. Documentary evidence also implies that meat was abundant and consumed in quantity during this period. French traveler Durand of Dauphine stated in 1687 that "As to cattle raised for food, however rapidly they may multiply, their number is kept down, for there is not a house so poor that they do not salt an ox, a cow and five or six large hogs (Durand 1934:123). It must be noted, however, that missing from the archeological samples are the homes of the poorest people and the en slaved, where some divergence from this pattern might be predicted. Samples from sites occupied after 1700 show that these overall dietary trends continued. Harvesting of wild animals decreased and cattle and swine</page><page sequence="36">266 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 remained the mainstays of the meat diet (Miiler 1984, 1988b; Bowen 1996). Beef averages 64% of the estimated meat and pork accounts for 25.7% dur ing the first half of the 18th century. Sheep/goat were also consumed but they remain a minor contributor to the diet. Most sites display considerable uni formity in faunal patterns. Colonists still hunted an occasional deer and took waterfowl or small mammals but there was a striking decline in fish usage. The paucity of fish remains on sites is perhaps best illustrated by the bone frequencies. Fish remains drop from an average of 35% (S.D. 24.5) of the total bone samples in Phase 1 assemblages, to 20.0% (14.8 S.D.) in Phase 2 down to 4.5% (S.D. 6.7) in Phase 3, a time span of less than a century. The total meat contribution mirrors this decrease. This trend in fish consumption is widespread across the region. Seventeenth century colonists ate fish in large quantities, especially those living nearer the Chesapeake Bay itself. People did not totally stop eating fish after 1700, but the level of consumption was dramatically reduced compared to the earlier1600s. It is part of the overall decline in wild resource usage that characterizes Chesapeake subsistence patterns, as may be illustrated by charting the wild meat estimates from dis crete trash deposits through time (Figure 11). This figure shows how the 80 70 H -1 -1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1 1610 1620 1630 1640 1650 1660 1670 1680 1690 1700 1710 1720 1730 1740 Figure 11.</page><page sequence="37">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake. 267 marked seasonal variation in use of wild resource usage displayed in the early samples essentially disappears by the first decades of the 18th century (Miller 1984). While most excavated faunal samples follow this general pat tern, it is likely that as more sites are excavated, especially those inhabited by enslaved peoples or the poorest tenants in the 18th century, more variabil ity will be recognized. Distinctions may also appear in dietary patterns be tween the northern and southern Chesapeake during the later 18th century, due to diverging agrarian regimes (Walsh, Martin and Bowen 1997:70). Re gional variability has not received sufficient attention and will be an important direction for future research. By its very nature, the process of colonization involves dynamic change. It requires the selection of appropriate responses to new natural and cultural settings. The faunal evidence from the Chesapeake region displays significant changes in subsistence practices over the first century of European settlement. These include an initial heavy usage of wild re sources and prominent seasonal variation. Over time, wild usage declines and there is greater overall uniformity in the meat diet. Eventually, a lim ited range of species comprise the basis of the diet, with wild resources providing little more than variety. Such trends are related to a maturing culture and greater environmental knowledge. Cattle and Swine emerged as the foundation of the subsistence system in terms of meat. These hardy creatures were allowed to run free and essentially care for them selves in a woodland husbandry system that required little labor or ex pense. This husbandry system had precedents in English agrarian history (Trow-Smith 1957:50-59) and proved a highly efficient and focused adap tation for the early Chesapeake. Indeed, meat was more readily available and probably consumed in greater quantities than in England. One con sequence of this may be that by the mid-eighteenth century, soldiers in English America were significantly taller than their British and European counterparts (Fogel 1983). The foodways that emerged by the late 1600s was a new dietary pattern that incorporated elements of American Indian origin, especially maize, with elements of the traditional English diet. African influences would also help shape the Chesapeake diet as the population of enslaved people dramati cally expanded in the region. The relationships between frontier adaptation, development of a mature society, demographic shifts, economic change and shifting foodway practices are highly complex. The growing body of archaeo logical data from the Chesapeake region is providing powerful insights re garding rapidly changing subsistence patterns in this frontier setting and elucidating how diverse factors influenced the development of the colonial diet in the region.</page><page sequence="38">268 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 Colonial cemeteries and mortuary practices One of the most prominent characteristics of life in the early Chesapeake was frequent death. Historians estimate that up to one-third of the newly arrived immigrants died within a year of their arrival (Walsh and Menard 1974). Buri als of these immigrants are being discovered and excavated by archaeolo gists with increasing frequency in the region and yielding valuable new evidence regarding life, disease, medical care and mortuary practices. The earliest colonial graves are found at Jamestown and a few were investigated during test excavations in the 1950s (Shiner 1957). Further investigations of burials at Jamestown were conducted by William Kelso, Jamie May, and Ashley McKeown from the late 1990s to 2004. Most of these burials were under the 1660s Ludwell Statehouse structure and represent a cemetery area used from ca. 1608 to ca. 1630. A total of 63 graves were dug contain ing the remains of 72 persons (Kelso and Straube 2004:128). This cemetery has yielded rare examples of multiple burials, with one grave containing three persons and ten graves holding two individuals. A few people were buried clothed, and a number of the graves are shallow, the bodies haphazardly arranged, and the shafts oriented in various directions. Such interments sug gest periods of exceptionally high mortality and these irregular burials proba bly date to the "starving time" of 1609-1610, when over two-thirds of the Jamestown population perished. Other burials were more formal and the shafts consistently east-west in orientation; they are likely to be from the fol lowing two decades, when more stable conditions prevailed. Of the 72 people in this sample, only seven were interred in wood coffins (Kelso and Straube 2004:127-128). More data about early mortuary practices came from Ivor Noel Hume's important investigation of the Martin's Hundred tract south of Jamestown. His excavations encountered a number of burials, some in coffins, others in shrouds and still others buried in apparent haste and without ceremony. In this case, the hasty burials are probably victims of the Powhatan Uprising of 1622, when many of the Martin's Hundred residents were killed (Noel Hume 1982; Noel Hume and Noel Hume 2001). Other burials from the first decades of settlement were excavated at the Maine site north of Jamestown (Outlaw 1990), and at Jordan's Journey site along the upper James River (Mouer et al. 1992; McLearen and Mouer 1993). Most colonists in the 17th-century Chesapeake were buried in small, iso lated plantation graveyards. Archaeologists have excavated a number of these including mid-17 -century graves at Port Anne near Williamsburg (Ed wards 1987) and the ca. 1630-1650 Buck site near Jamestown, Virginia (Mal lios 1999). In Maryland, a 1658-ca.1685 cemetery was dug at the Patuxent Point site on the Patuxent River in Maryland (King and Ubelaker 1996), a late 17th to early 18th-century burial area investigated at the Clifts Plantation along</page><page sequence="39">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake. 269 the Potomac River (Neiman 1980), and a late 17 to 18 -century cemetery dug at Middle Plantation near Annapolis, Maryland (Doepkins 1991). The most systematic study of temporal change in mortuary behavior con ducted thus far in the Chesapeake is of the cemetery associated with the Jesuit chapel at St. Mary's City (Riordan 2003). Burial occurred there for at least a century from 1635 to ca. 1740, and the graves can be sorted into three temporal phases based on orientation and grave fill content. The first burials (1635- ca.1666) are related to a 1630s wooden chapel, the first Ro man Catholic church in English America or date to the years after its burning by Protestant soldiers in 1645. A second group of interments date from the Brick Chapel era (ca.1667-ca.1710). The third group of graves date from after the chapel was demolished (ca.1710- ca.1740). Due to Lord Baltimore losing control of Maryland in the 1689 revolution, Catholics gradually lost their free dom and were forbidden to worship at the Chapel in 1704 by the Royal gov ernor. The Jesuits dismantled the structure a few years later, but burial activity continued at the site for several decades. The cemetery associated with the chapel contains an estimated 500 interments, of which 60 graves (12%) are excavated. Thirty one of these are from Period 1, twenty four are from Period 2 and five date to Period 3. All are Europeans and they were interred both with and without coffins. Although nearly all of the wood has decayed, careful plotting of nail placements and orientations allowed Riordan to identify the construction methods of these wooden coffins. Unexpectedly, this revealed that at least eight distinct types of coffins were used in the cha pel cemetery (Figure 12). Among these are a simple rectangular, hexagonal, tapered, and gable lidded forms. The most unusual is an anthropomorphic shape not previously found in English American contexts. Study of these burials indicates prominent changes in mortuary behavior occurred over time. The early graves are a mix of shroud interments and coffin burials with less than half (43%) of the people placed in coffins. As with domestic architecture, this diversity of coffins types may reflect the presence of immigrants from a variety of regions who brought distinctive traditions of coffin construction with them to Maryland (Riordan 2003:6-2). Burial ritual, however, was consistent. People were interred in grave shafts oriented roughly east-west, with the corpses lying in an extended position on their backs with the face up and for nearly all, the head was at the west end of the grave shaft. Three graves had the head at the east end and whether this was intentional or accidental is uncertain. Hands are either joined at the waist or resting on the upper thighs. Most were wrapped in shrouds and none display evidence of being interred with normal clothing. Furthermore, archaeologists found no grave goods, with the exception of 13 beads in one burial that were probably a one decade rosary. The burial protocol found at the Chapel gen erally reflects Christian practice in the English tradition. Most English burials are extended with the corpse wrapped in a shroud, laying flat and the head</page><page sequence="40">270 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 Figure 12.</page><page sequence="41">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake. 271 on the west end of the grave shaft. Intriguingly, burials on Spanish colonial and mission sites in the Southeastern United States, although also Roman Catholic, consistently have the head on the east side of the grave with the hands in a different position (Koch 1983:197-198; Hoshower and Milanich 1993:219). Such variation is probably attributable to ethnic influences on burial programs. Over time, the variety of coffin shapes and construction methods at the Chapel is reduced to a single form - the hexagonal flat lidded coffin. In addi tion, the practice of interment without coffins was gradually abandoned for universal coffin burial. By the late 17th century, 90% of the Chapel burials are in coffins. From Phase 3, although the sample is small, all are buried in hex agonal coffins. Other sites in the region confirm this pattern. Less than 10% of the pre-1630 Jamestown graves have coffins (Kelso and Straub 2004), while 38% of the interments at the rural Patuxent Point site from the 1658 ca.1685 period are in coffins (King and Ubelacker 1996). Burials from the last decades of the 17th century and in the 18th-century are nearly 100% coffin interments, as indicated by cemeteries at the Clifts and Middle Plantations (Neiman 1980; Doepkins 1991). These graves are almost all hexagonal cof fins. One important difference in mortuary treatment was found in the Clifts Plantation cemetery. Although both the plantation owners and the enslaved Africans were interred in wood coffins, several of the Africans were buried fully clothed, perhaps reflecting the retention of African customs (Neiman 1980:28-29). None of the Chapel graves yielded evidence of burial in regular clothing. The increasing uniformity in burial behavior over time and the virtual abandonment of non-coffin interment may reflect the growing stability of the society, and the appearance of a mature colonial culture in the region, as well as a decrease in the rate of English immigration to the Tidewater area. Cer tainly the early variety of coffin types would seem to reflect the presence of people with different traditions. On the other hand, the trend toward nearly universal burial in coffins occurs at roughly the same time in England as it does in the Chesapeake (Gittings 1984:240; Litten 1992), suggesting the operation of broader cultural influences and a strong trans-Atlantic connec tion in mortuary practices between the homeland and colonies. At the Chapel, hundreds of people were interred in the graveyard around the structure, with a smaller number buried inside. Cultural preference was to be buried on the south or east side of the church. Excavations revealed few graves on the north side, and most were small, suggesting children. This is probably explained by a lingering medieval belief that the north side was only suitable for suicides, other sinners and unbaptized children (Rodwell 1989). Archaeologists found evidence of intensive burial activity inside the chapel. Interment within a religious structure was more desirable than outside in the cemetery and burial location is probably status linked. But interment within the church did not insure that the deceased would rest in peace. Most of the interior burials were partially intruded or cut through by later interments.</page><page sequence="42">272 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 The best examples of high status burial at the Chapel site are three lead coffins archaeologists discovered buried in the north transept (Figure 13). This prestigious form of burial was typically reserved for royalty, nobility and high church officials in 16th and 17 -century England and Europe. These three coffins were the only contemporary interments in the north transept of the chapel, and date to the 1680s. They are a rare discovery, being the only lead coffins found by archaeologists from early English America. To identify who they were and learn as much as possible from the contents of these coffins, a multi-disciplinary scientific study was conducted with the assistance Figure 13.</page><page sequence="43">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake. 273 of many specialists and organizations including the Smithsonian Institution, N.A.S.A., and the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. Investigators found that the smallest coffin contained a six month old girl, the middle coffin held the remains of a woman around 60 years in age, and the largest coffin con tained a male in his mid 50s. The woman had well preserved bones, and the child was partially preserved, but the man's condition was bizarre. His bones below the waist were in excellent condition but much of the upper half of the body had been transformed into a white crystalline substance, mostly the mineral brushite. Despite the nearly complete crystallization of the skull, his full head of hair was perfectly preserved. Neutron Activation Analysis ( EA) of the crystals by Pennsylvania State University scientists suggests that this resulted from an attempt at embalming. The scientific team collected the widest possible range of evidence from the human bones and hair, the lead coffins and internal wooden coffins, the pollen and insect remains preserved inside the coffins, and from the grave fill. Analysis by palynologist Gerald Kelso determined the seasons of death for each individual and provided valuable evidence about the vegetation in St. Mary's City in the late 1600s, while study of the well preserved insect remains provided a unique perspective on the early colonial environment. Assessment of all the evidence led to the identification of the coffin occu pants as members of Lord Baltimore's family, who had died between 1679 and 1683 (Miller, Riordan and Hurry 2004). This elite form of burial was rarely used in English America. It probably reflects the Calvert's perception of themselves as Maryland royalty, a status conferred by the unprece dented charter given by the King of England to Lord Baltimore. But despite their social position and great wealth, study of the remains shows that the young child suffered from rickets and anemia, the woman had severe dental disease that went untreated, and when she broke her femur, it was not set. Rather, someone simply splinted the leg and it healed with the right foot permanently twisted outward and the right leg three inches shorter than the left. Project Lead Coffins and the related chapel site excavations (Miller, Riordan and Hurry 2004; Riordan 2003) provide a good example of inter disciplinary scholarship and the valuable insights that may be derived from historic period mortuary contexts. Analysis of the composition of human bones has been conducted on a number of samples from the Chesapeake region. One important early effort was the study of lead concentrations in human remains from the Gifts Planta tion (Aufderheide et al. 1981). Excavators found that the 17 graves in the cemetery were segregated into two groups. One consisted of European men, children, and a woman that were probably the plantation owners while the other group was enslaved Africans and a single European servant. Lead content varied dramatically. The plantation owners had very high levels, in</page><page sequence="44">274 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 23 eluding even the children, while the enslaved people had low levels. This status related variation in lead ingestion is probably due to the differential use of pewter vessels and implements versus wooden ware and ceramics over a life time. Such high lead levels would have had significant health conse quences, especially for the children. Isotopie study of human remains from Jamestown, St. Mary's City, Patuxent Point and other sites have also been conducted. Initial comparison of stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values revealed unexpected dietary diversity among individuals. Factors thought to contribute to this variation are levels of maize consumption, the origins of the settlers and length of time they were in the colonies (Ubelaker and Owsley 2003). Additional analysis is underway and isotopie studies appear to provide a valuable tool with which to distinguish new immigrants from long term resi dents and native born persons. Investigations of cemeteries are providing many insights about life and death in the Chesapeake colonies. Frequent death was an undeniable aspect of life in the early Chesapeake and a significant risk for all immigrants, as well as the Algonquian inhabitants. As the archaeological data presented here indicate, notable changes also occurred in how the dead were treated during the first century of settlement, changes that were generally toward greater uniformity and equality in the treatment of the deceased. Colonization and the early Chesapeake Colonization is an enduring feature of human culture and it is an important topic of archaeological research (cf. Cusick 1998; Stein 2005). Colonies have been created by states for millennia, but the expansion of Europeans since the late 15th century initiated an unprecedented series of world wide encounters. One result was the creation of a new Atlantic World that linked the continents of Europe, North America, South America, and Africa for the first time in a web of economic, biological, political, demographic and cultural connections (cf. Bailyn 1996; Elliott 2002). A part of this story is how immi grants in diverse settings succeeded or failed, while another part is how the original inhabitants of these colonized lands coped with or suffered from the se encounters. These interactions brought about significant transformations for all involved, and from them emerged new societies with unique identities and cultural perspectives. The Chesapeake is one chapter in this large and complex story. Out of the sustained cultural interactions that took place along the Bay, a creole society emerged that incorporated Algonquian practices and African influ ences with its English core. As the scene of one of the earliest English colo nization efforts in America, it set precedents that influenced later colonies. All Chesapeake Indians were ultimately negatively affected by contact, but they</page><page sequence="45">The Archaeology of Colonial Encounters along Chesapeake. 275 responded to the arrival of colonists in a variety of ways, reflecting their di verse cultures and the complex nature of the process. It is clear that Algon quian culture was essential for the success of the English settlers, especially the crops, a forest-adapted agrarian system and subsistence activities. For the English, archaeology shows that their architecture, subsistence patterns and mortuary behavior changed dramatically over the course of the 17th cen tury. Each of these cultural elements displayed similar trends from diversity to uniformity as a stable adaptation and mature society emerged. Sufficient archaeological data from the region are now available to trace these changes in considerable detail, allowing us to begin understanding how and why Che sapeake society developed in the way that it did. After an effective adaptation had been achieved and refined, however, colonial Chesapeake society did not cease changing. Between 1680 and 1710, natural population growth was achieved and a native-born colonial elite arose in the Tidewater area (Jordan 1979; Shammas 1979). With inherited land and wealth, these elites developed large plantations, acquired political power, and created a more stratified social hierarchy. Equally significant was a profound shift from a labor system based on European indentured servants to one that relied upon enslaved Africans. By 1715, the Chesapeake colonies were transformed into slave societies. Compared to the 17th century, 18th century society was increasingly segregated, rigid and hierarchical. Suffice it to say that the 17th-and 18th-century Chesapeake was two very different worlds, and the archaeological record clearly reflects these differences. European expansion is a fundamental aspect of history over the last five centuries. Each colonial encounter had distinctive characteristics because of differing goals, approaches, and cultures of the colonizers, and the rich diver sity of cultures and settings they came into contact with. But each case also has commonalities due to the operation of the same cultural phenomena of colonization, adaptation and resistance, making comparative analysis an especially rewarding undertaking. Archaeology has a vital role to play throughout the Americas in revealing and understanding these powerful pro cesses of contact, transformation, and social creation that have truly shaped the modern world.
