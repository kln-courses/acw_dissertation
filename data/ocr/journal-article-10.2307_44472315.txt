Columbus, OH ABSTRACT There is currently a considerable effort being devoted to the development of anthropomorphic test devices for the measurement of thoracic side impact response. Both the SID and EUROS ID have been proposed as viable candidates for this test device. In addition, the thorax of the three year old Part 572 has been shown to be useful in simulating side impact while used in the frontal orientation. This apparent anomaly suggests that the intuitive differences between, the frontal and side geometries of the thorax may not be signifi- cant. To date, all useable thoracic models have been unidirectional. For the most part, these have been frontal models. This paper discusses some of the difficulties inherent in the develop- ment of a two dimensional thoracic model and ways these difficulties can be addressed. Based on these considerations, a single thoracic impact model is proposed for simulation of both frontal and lateral impact without adjustment of model parameters for impact direction. The model response is compared with two dimensional thoracic impact data obtained from cadaveric specimens as reported in the literature. The merits of the model as well as its deficiencies are discussed. OVER THE PAST DECADE, there have typically been close to 50,000 traffic fatalities each year in the United States (1). These fatalities include both vehicle occupants and pedestrians. General- ly, the most serious injuries occur to the thorax for occupants whereas only twenty percent of pedestrian fatalities involve lethal thoracic injuries (2). These injuries include rib frac- tures, cardiac ruptures, nervous disfunction, pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusions, and bronchial ruptures. This large number of fatalities can best be reduced by providing built in protection in the automobile to minimize injury when an accident occurs. The process of /minimizing the injury poten- tial of an automobile can take two basic forms. In one form accidents are reconstructed, the causes determined, and the resulting injuries recorded (3) . This information is then statisti- cally analyzed and particularly hazardous regions of the automobile are identified. Engineering judgment is then used to redesign these parts to reduce the frequency of injury. Although Ashton (4) had shown this procedure to be repeatable and effective, it is preferred to eliminate the cause of injury before the accident. As a result, after-the-fact methods are not the sole means of automotive redesign for injury reduction. Application of the scientific method to automobile design is a more typical approach. In this procedure, a possible design improvement is formulated and its ability to reduce injury is intuitively estimated by experienced engineers. The design can then be evaluated either analyti- cally with a biomechanic simulation or experimen- tally using a cadaveric test specimen or anthro- pomorphic test device. Of these options, the analytical simulation is usually the most effi- cient and inexpensive approach. The design can then be incorporated into a prototype and tested in the laboratory. The objective of this research is to develop an analytical model of the human thorax which accurately simulates measured impact response. The model focuses on simulating the motion of the bony structure of the thorax when impacted from the front or side. This motion is compared with anterior-posterior and medial-lateral accelera- tion and displacement data taken from cadaveric impact and quasi-static force-deflection tests. Forces and kinematics along the axis of the spine are not considered and as a result, the model represents a cross section of the thorax. In addition, the model will calculate the internal thoracic pressure and the force applied during the impact. These responses are also compared with experimental measurements. BACKGROUND Analytical efforts to model the thorax have met with limited success in the past. This is 700</page><page sequence="2">not to say that the existing models are incapable of simulating measured impact data. On the con- trary, the response of each model compared favorable with all or part of the published impact data. The data most often used for these comparisons were published by Kroell (5) . Other referenced data include that presented by Patrick (6) and Nahum (7). The limitations of these models lies in the fact that they simulate only one measure of thoracic kinematics, namely force-deflection information, and that they are valid for only one direction of impact. This data is summarized by the force-deflection corridors shown in Figure 1 (8). A review of the more important models follows. (2.5^230) " !2oo ' .-•-••i '■V2 i - (1,1030) '6* (2- 25.

King (9) presents an excellent review of thoracic models developed through 1973 along with the extent of validation of these models. Based on the modeling efforts to that time, he suggests that future models should address visceral injuries, possibly by computing aterial or bronchial pressure during impact and by defining the motion of the heart and lungs. During the early 1970 !s, the Franklin Institute conducted an in-depth study of the thorax which focused on three primary tasks (10). Those tasks are: measurement of the geometry of the thorax of a Rhesus monkey; development of an experimental technique to measure the dynamic response of a Rhesus monkey; prepare a detailed finite element model of the human thorax. The finite element model was divided into the major structures of the thorax including the ribs, spine, sternum, lungs, heart, and aorta. Each of these major structures was modeled in sufficient detail to define all possible force interactions within the chest. Although it is not specifical- ly stated in the report, the final model appears to have thousands of nodes and elements. A subset of the complete model consisting of the bony structure of the thorax and including 119 nodes, 118 elements, and 712 degrees of freedom was assembled and used to simulate the response to impact with a pendulum. The response is compared to the loading portion of the Kroell data (5) and agrees fairly well for about the first twelve milliseconds. Comparison with data after twelve milliseconds is not presented. The project was discontinued in 1975 due to lack of funding. The model had not been developed further since. Lobdell and his associates (8) developed a two mass lumped model of the chest as shown in Figure 2. As can be seen in Table 1, all the TABLE 1 - Parameter Values for LobdelDs Viscoelastic and Simplified Two Mass Lumped Parameter Models of the Chest Viscoelastic Simplified Units m2 0.45 (1.0) 0.45 (1.0) kg (lbf) m3 27.2 (60.0) 27.2 (60.0) k12 281 (1600) 281 (1600) kN/m (lbf/in) k23, initial* 26.3 (150) 78.8 (450) k23, final* 26.3 (150) 78.8 (450) k23ve 13.2 (75) kN-s lbrs C23, compression 0.53 (3.0) 0.53 (3.0) m in C23, extension 1.2 (7.0) 1.2 (7.0) C23ve 0.18(1.0) * The spring rate for K23 changes from the initial to final value when the model deflection reaches 3.81 cm (1.5 in) for the viscoelastic model and 3.18 cm (1.25 in) for the simplified model. 701</page><page sequence="3">system elements are either linear or quasi- linear. The response of this model compared favorably with force deflection data presented by Kroell (5), Patrick (6) and Nahum (7). The model was subsequently used for development of the Hybrid II dummy thorax (8). During this work, it was found that the viscoelastic element could be neglected if some modifications were made in the other parameter values (11). The values for these parameters are given in Table 1. ^23' ^23 Impoctor Sternum ' Spine - lyw - m i «. m2 m3 kB WW - HE- kve23 cve23 FIGURE 2 Viscoelastic two mass lumped parameter model of the thorax. During the period of approximately 1970 to 1978, Chen and - Roberts (12, 13) developed a finite element model of the thorax applicable to frontal impact situations. The model specifies the geometry of each rib, the spine, and the sternum with the mass of the various ' organs lumped at nodes around the chest wall. Only skeletal stiffness was considered and small deformations were assumed. The entire structure was divided into subsystems (i.e., each rib, spine, sternum) and the response- was determined using component node synthesis. Validation of the model was performed using five cadaver sternal impact tests reported by Kroell (5) and other sternal force-deflection data reported by Patrick (6) and Nahum (7). Comparison of the responses was promising, but not exact. Chen maintains that the discrepancies were due to differing initial conditions, dissimilar force application, and the fact that the cadavers sustained rib fractures. Unfortunately, the model was only designed for frontal impacts and further developments have not been reported in the literature. At about the same time that Chen was formu- lating his initial model, Kazemieslamian (14) developed a very similar three dimensional model of the thorax. As with Chen's model, this one used beam elements to represent the skeletal structures and tensile elements for the major muscles. Small deflections are assumed and masses are lumped on the chest wall. A signifi- cant difference is that Chen1 s model simulates the response to a blunt impact on the sternum while Kazemieslamian' s model is designed to simulate the response of the chest to a -G acceleration by a shoulder belt. Although there is good agreement with some data (15), the Kazemieslamian model does not agree with Kroell force-deflection corridors (5). Kaleps (16) presented an interesting model in 1975 in which he attempted to account for a variety of internal thoracic kinematics including respiratory and abdominal interactions. A schematic of this model is shown in Figure 3. The model even allows for gross translation of the entire thoracic structure and superficial tissue characteristics at the point of contact with the impactor. However, the model is rather specific in that all its parameters are lumped and it accepts an impact only from the front. Also, it was designed to simulate only anterior- posterior force-deflection data, which it does reasonably well. Modifying the model for multi- directional use for additional types of data is not straightforward. The model response compares favorably with the Kroell data (5).

Wismans (18, 19) developed a model of the thorax in the late 1970' s and early 1980' s to simulate response to side impact. As shown in Figure 4, the model consisted of a series of rigid links connected in the shape of a ring, much like the configuration of ribs. This model was intended for use in comparing the responses of' various dummies and as such it more closely resembled the general structure of a dummy thorax than of the human thorax. However, the response of the model agreed well with experimentally obtained dummy impact response. The response of the model has not been compared directly with cadaver impact response. To the extent that the dummies adequately duplicate human kinematics, the model gives good results. This model is significant in that it shows that a simple ring structure has the potential of simulating thora- cic dynamics. Two things are clear from the review of the ixisting thoracic models. First, very few researchers have attempted to develop a workable model of the thorax. Until recently, the un- availability of good data has discouraged such an effort. However, the seriousness and frequency of injuries to the chest justify a more concerted effort. Second, the models that do exist are severely limited in their application. All but 702</page><page sequence="4">one of them were developed for for frontal impact only. The other model was intended for side impact only. Development of a bidirectional model could provide a much needed tool to study thoracic kinematics and injury. ^7 s Spine i / » ^ ! /Flexible Connection i / of Rib to Spine ^Ribcage Simulated ^ - * ! ^SSs&lt;V&gt; 7 Segments FIGURE 4 MADYMO side impact model of dummy thorax. DATA There are essentially two types of thoracic impact data which have been acquired over the years: force-deflection data and acceleration data. The selection of which type of data to use and further which tests to include in the current work is fairly straightforward since the acceler- ation type data provide a much more thorough description of thoracic kinematics. Moreover, the corresponding force-deflection data for these tests can be calculated from the accelerometer data using the Truillo technique (19). The data used for the development of the model was obtained by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) in the mid 1970fs (20). The data consists of the time responses of twelve accelerometers mounted to the bony structure of the thorax as shown in Figure 5. The tests in this group can be divided into two main classes - impacts with a simple, well defined surface such as a flat faced pendulum and impacts with more complex structures such as steering wheels, dash boards, and doors. Partly because of the simplicity of the structure and partly because the pendulum tests included the force of the impactor on the chest, it was decided to use the pendulum/piston tests for the modeling data base. The pendulum tests were conducted with three impact speeds directed at the thorax from two directions and produced varying degrees of injury. There were "tap" tests in which the impactor velocity was 0.9 m/s (3 ft/s), low speed "hits" with an impactor velocity of 4.6 m/s (14 ft/s), and high speed "hits" with a speed of 6.1 m/s (20 ft/s). These impact speeds were used in both side and front impacts. Injury was deter- mined by autopsy and varied from no injury to severely crushed chest with the concommitant damage to internal organs. Due to the fact that the load carrying structure of the thorax changes when the ribs fracture, the only pendulum hit data included in the modeling data base were those for which the test subject sustained no fractured ribs. Further, only the tap tests corresponding to these non-injurious hits were included in the data base. Finally, only tests in which all data channels were available and usable were selected.

Further, there are three frontal hits, two side hits, three frontal taps and two side taps. The impact speed for all the hits was 4.6 m/s (14 ft/s) and for the taps was 0.9 m/s (3 ft/s). The data avail- able for each of these tests include the ąccel- erometer signals from the twelve accelerometer array, a measure of either the airway pressure or the cardiovascular pressure, the deceleration of the impactor, and a variety of anthropometric measurements taken prior to testing. In addi- tion, high speed films of the tests were used to determine gross displacement as a function of time. MODELING APPROACH It has been shown that rib fracture is a good indicator of the level of thoracic injury (21,22,23). This is based on the idea that for injury to occur, the ribs must deflect and crush internal structures or must break and then puncture these structures. In either case it has been found that injury to internal structures occurs primarily after rib fractures. Moreover, the number of rib fracture is directly related to the severity of the injury. Thus, an acceptable thoracic model could be a simple lumped parameter representation of the ribs and their connections. This model should be capable of simulating the motion of the ribs during an impact situation. It was decided that the simplest model that could simulate the motion of the ribs would be a two dimensional ring similar in shape to the ribs in a horizontal cross section of the chest. Any further simplicity would limit the kinematic freedom of the model to a level below that necessary to simulate rib motion. Actually, the ribs are much more complex than a two dimensional model can describe. This is because the ribs slope downward anteriorly and laterally from the spine. The results of this study show however that this added complexity is not necessarily relevant to thoracic impact response. The rib structure was modeled using a lumped parameter approach. This requires the formula- tion and solution of a set of differential equations which describe the system1 s motion. For thoracic impact studies, it is desired to obtain solutions in the form of acceleration as a function of time. To facilitate such solutions, the general purpose lumped parameter digital simulation program MADÝM0 (24, 25) was utilized. SIMULATION PROGRAM MADYMO was developed by the Research Insti- tute for Road Vehicles, TNO, in the Netherlands. The input to MADYMO requires definition of the geometry and the reactive properties between the lumped elements. The program then writes the differential equations for the system and solves for the time response; MADYMO is available in both two and three dimensional versions. For this work, it was decided to use a two dimen- sional model in an attempt to retain simplicity. MADYMO has been successfully applied to several areas of impact biomechanics including pedestrian impact, child safety, and occupant simulation (25) as well as simulation of individual body part kinematics (17, 18). MODEL PARAMETERS The geometry chosen for the thorax model is shown in Figure 6. It consists of seventeen rigid links connected by pinned joints. All the links lie in and are restricted to motion in a horizontal plane. The anterior-posterior dimen- sions are based on measurements taken from the cadavers described previously. The general shape of the model was arbitrarily selected based on thoracic cross section drawings (27) . The two elements numbered 16 and 17 in Figure 6 comprise the spine. Element 8 represents the sternum. The left and right ribs consist of elements 1 through 7 and 9 through 16, respectively. Ele- ments 16 and 17 are not connected to each other directly due to a restriction of the Lagrangian formulation of the differential equations which TABLE 2 - Cadaver Thoracic Impact Tests Included in the Modeling Data Base Age Height Weight Thorax Number of Fractures Velocity Test Number Sex (Years) (cm) (kg) AIS Ribs Other (m/s) Test Description 76T056 F 40 - 70 0 0 0 4.27 Front Pendulum 76T058 M 76 - 88 0 0 0 0.91 Front Tap 76T059 M 76 - 88 3 0 0 4.27 Front Pendulum 76T063 M 63 - 95 0 0 0 0.91 Front Tap 76T064 M 63 - 95 0 0 0 0.91 Side Tap 76T065 M 63 - 95 1 0 0 4.27 Side Pendulum 77T067 M 52 174.5 62.1 0 0 0 0.91 Front Tap 77T068 M 52 174.5 62.1 5 1 1 4.37 Front Pendulum 77T070 M 60 172.2 80.2 0 0 0 0.91 Side Tap 77T071 M 60 172.2 80.2 3 0 0 4.37 Side Pendulum 704</page><page sequence="6">does not allow closed link systems.

The total mass was determined from parameter estimation tech- niques (26, 27, 28) and published data (12, 29). The total mass was then assumed to be uniformly distributed around the thoracic wall. The simulation joint stiffness characteristics were derived from parameter estimation, rib bending test data (20, 30), and cadaveric thoracic stiff- ness tests (7, 31). The parameters defining the interaction of the model with the impactor were selected on the basis of the physical dimensions of the impactor and chest flesh. Parameters such as damping were estimated initially using engi- neering judgment and then refined with repetitive simulation. INTERNAL THORACIC PRESSURE - One aspect of thoracic impact that has been little studied in the past is the effect of internal pressure on thoracic kinematics. Kaleps (16) identified in his model that pressure should be considered and incorporated the ability to compute pressure but was restricted by the lack of data. For the thoracic ring model, the enclosure defining the pressurized volume is given as the area enclosed by the ribs, sternum, and spine. This area is represented in Figure 7. In addition to defining the pressurized enclosure, other parameters are TABLE 3 - Summary of Final Model Parameter Values Number of Elements 17 Element Length 5.6 cm (2.2 in) Mass of Elements 0.454 kg (1 lbm) Moment of Inertia of Elements 1-15 0.0001 187 kq-m2 (0.405 lb -in2) ?

The force on the walls of the enclosure is calculated from the pressure within the enclosure. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS -- It is clear that a simple cross section of the chest must interact at its boundaries with the adjacent upper and lower portions by shear forces. One method of dealing with boundary conditions is to specify the motion of the spine as an input. Specifi- cally, the spine is artificially forced to follow the measured acceleration. In this way the boundary conditions are implicitly taken into account without determination of the boundary force distributions on the upper and lower surfaces of the model cross section. Unfortu- nately, this approach limits the utility of the model to cases where spinal motion is already known. The approach taken was to incorporate the boundary condition initially to eliminate the possibility that these conditions could manifest themselves as variations in the model parameters ¿ The model response was then compared with mea- sured data. Finally, the boundary conditions were eliminated and the model response was again evaluated. For side impacts, the asymmetrical geometry of the model requires consideration of additional boundary restraints. Since the impactor in a side test contacts the model at the midpoint of the side, the spinal boundary condition is insufficient to prevent unstable rotation of the chest about the spine. It was found that the best way to model boundary effects in side impact is to include a restraint on the sternum in the direction of impact. Such a lateral sternum boundary condition was constructed by connecting a spring and damper of arbitrary spring constant and damping value from an extension of the spine to the sternum. Although the extension does not correspond directly to any anatomical structure it does allow the transmission of a lateral restraint to the sternum. Again, this restraint is only used as a boundary condition and is not a part of the model. FIGURE 7 The enclosed area used to calculate the pressure exerted on the thoracic walls. RESULTS The thoracic ring model and its parameter set were developed using data from a single frontal hit (76T056) and a single side hit (76T065). A front and side simulation were then performed using the parameter values which gave the best responses for these two test conditions. These parameter values are the same for both the front and side cases. The resulting simulations were compared with the measured responses from tests 76T056 and 76T065. The simulations of these two tests formed the basis for the model development. As a check on the quality of the model, the model response was then compared with data from the remaining eight tests in the modeling data base. FRONTAL HIT RESULTS - The results of the simulation with boundary conditions included using data of the front hit 76T056 are shown in Figure 8. In all cases, the solid line repre- sents the simulation. As described earlier, four acceleration channels define the radial motion of the rib cage and the motion of the impactor, one pressure channel displays the thoracic internal pressure and one force versus deflection (force- deflection) channel is shown. The force plotted is the force applied to the sternum by the impactor and the deflection is the decrease in the distance between sternum and the spine. The acceleration responses of the model as shown in Figure 8 generally agree well with the measured data. The initial peak acceleration match fairly well in both magnitude and phasing. There is some residual vibration present in the simulation which may indicate a need for higher damping values than could be achieved with this simulation. The simulated deceleration of the impactor also closely resembles the measured data. Simulation of the intrathoracic pressure is also shown in Figure 8. Clearly, the simulated differential pressure has a higher peak (90 k Pa, 13 psig) than the measured differential pressure (14 k Pa, 2 psig). The duration and general shapes of the curves are similar except for the difference in magnitude. The reported pressure data for all tests consisted of either airway pressure or cardiovascular pressure, but not both. In this test, the airway pressure was given. Comparison of the measured pressure for this test with cardiovascular pressures of other frontal tests indicated that the simulated pressure more closely replicates cardiovascular pressure. The most popular means of quantifying thoracic kinematics has traditionally been a plot of the force applied to the chest versus deflec- tion of the chest in the direction of impact. The deflection for the frontal case is the amount of compression measured between the sternum and the spine during the impact. This single curve gives a relatively large amount of information about the impact kinematics including the maximum force experienced by the sternum, the resulting comparison, the instantaneous dynamic stiffness 706</page><page sequence="8">o o 8j ' 1 ' 1 řH ' 1 1 ' - - - - Data Doto O Simulation O Simulation Ś ,' ?

Comparison of the data and simulation response plotted in Figure 8 shows general agreement. This is especially significant since most of the force deflection curve is drawn during the" early part of the impact where injury occurs as the thorax is being loaded. Comparison of the agreement shown in Figure 8 with the collection of data reported by Kroell (5) in Figure 9 shows that the variation between the simulated and measured curves is less than the variations observed between the responses of different cadavers. SIDE HIT RESULTS - The simulated and measured accelerations for side hit numbered 76T065 are shown in Figure 10. As with the frontal test, the simulated accelerations agree with the measured accelerations in relative magnitude, shape, and phasing of the responses.

As is shown in Figure 10, there is disagree- ment between the measured and simulated pres- sures. There are number of possible explana- tions for this difference which center around measurement of the pressure and the kinematics of the model and test subject. As defined by measurements taken from the cadaver test subjects, the ratio of the model depth to its width is 0.6. This value gives an ellipticly shaped ring as shown in Figure 11. When the model is compressed from the side, the sternum and the nearby rib elements move forward. Since the ellipse is fairly long and narrow and the joint stiffnesses are significant, it can reasonably be assumed that the enclosed area will increase during side compression. In fact, Figure 11 shows that the increase is about 6 percent of the original enclosed area 20 milli- seconds after impact begins. Since the internal pressure calculation in the model is based on the enclosed area, it is clear that the model pres- sure should decrease initially in a side impact. This is one instance in which the assumption of two dimensional ribs may affect the model* s response. The pressure measured in both of the side hits in the modeling data base is the cardio- vascular pressure. The transducer for this measurement is located in the heart, well away from the point of impact. Moreover, there is no direct communication between the pleural cavity nearest impact and the cardiovascular system at the heart. This is in contrast to the frontal impact situation where the pressure transducer is proximally near the point of impact. Thus, there is reason to believe that the measured pressure is not necessarily representative of the pressure in the left pleural cavity. Kaleps agrees that the exact nature of the pressure distribution in the thorax during impact has not been established (16). Attempting to justify its positive or negative trends based on existing measurements or kinematics is purely academic. Keeping this in mind, the simulated differential pressure pre- sented in Figure 10 is reasonable since it ranges from -27 k Pa (-4 psig) to 17 k Pa (2.5 psig) . The final comparison of the data and simula- tion for the side impact is the force-deflection. The general shapes of these curves are similar as is the energy absorption, peak force, and maximum deflection. There are a few differences, most notably the slopes of the lines do not agree at the beginning of the impact nor at the end. As with the front impact force-deflection curve, however, these discrepancies are well within the variations observed in measurement of these values from cadaver to cadaver (Figure 9). OTHER FRONT AND SIDE HIT RESULTS - After the model was developed using data from front hit 76T056 and side hit 76T065, the remaining two frontal hits numbered 76T059 and 77T068 and the remaining side hit numbered 77T071 were simulated using the same model parameters and the responses were compared with measured data. The compari- sons for the frontal hits are presented by Wiechel (26) and the interested reader is di- rected there for a full discussion. The results were very similar to those shown here for tests 76T056 and 76T065. FRONT AND SIDE TAP RESULTS - Having veri- fied the model for the quasi-static case and for an impactor speed of 4.27 m/s (14 ft/s), the model was used to simulate a low speed impact of 0.914 m/s (3 ft/s) and compared with corres- ponding measured data. Three front tap tests numbered 76T058, 76T063, and 77T067 were avail- able for this comparison. The results of the simulation and the corresponding data for test 76T058 are shown in Figure 12. This figure shows that the model generally follows the trends of the data but not as precisely as for the higher speed impact. This is due, at least in part, to measurement noise in the data. For example, the effect of filtering is shown in Figure 13 which gives the filtered (100 Hz lowpass) and unfiltered (1650 Hz lowpass) impac- tor acceleration data for test 76T058. Clearly, the signal to noise ratio is well below one. This is due to the test protocal which specified use of wide range accelerometers in the front and 708</page><page sequence="10">o o iņ-l 1 1 1 1 u oj i i i i L "* CM Do la (lo»«r •rtftr-um) Oo&lt;„ Do'a («»« sternum) Simulation 0 Simulation S" u ^ * i /' sr' ' _ /' ' OVi I /' ' KJ&gt; I / ' ' 1 /' ' ]' ' KJ&gt; // ' ' ' £ '/ ]' ' / N - / Nv // N ' ;gq.j £ '/ ^ '■ ^ - / N »r - / ^ Nv ~ .2 / N ' ' '■ . ^ - ' 7 ^ - ~ o / ' ' ' -»o t f o »o / ' ' -»o §-■ t * ^ XV f »o l ' ' ' § V./ o J n. o * - ■*" ™ - " ■=" " 1 'o.O 20.0 40.0 80.0 80.0 100.0 *0.0 20.0 40.0 60.0 80.0 100.0 Time (oris) Time (ms) Lower sternal acceleration Pendulum acceleration Si ■ . nolo 1 lļ Ooło . . ^ , to -5 nolo Ooło -5 Simulation Simulation .

The instrumentation would therefore be the same for each of these three tests but yield a low signal to noise ratio for the tap tests. Keeping this in mind, the model appears to fairly simulate a frontal tap. The magnitude of the peak accelerations and the placement of the peaks are generally close to the recorded data. Two side tap tests numbered 76T064 and 77T070 were simulated and the result of the simulation of test 76T064 are shown in Figure 14. The simulated impactor accelerations generally match the data. The simulated force-deflections also have the same overall shape as the measured curves. However, the simulation obviously rebounds too far during the unloading phase. It should be noted, however, that this excessive rebound is about 1.5 mm (0.059 in). /-20 ms After Impact Preimpact ^ /7 Shape - ^ V l J/ FIGURE 11 Comparison of the model geometry for a side hit before impact and at 20 ms after initial contact with the impactor. MODEL WITH NO BOUNDARY CONDITIONS - Figure 9 shows that there is a considerable variation in the response of a group of cadaver test subjects. This is caused by differences in size, weight, bone strengths, skeletal geometry, and a host of other characteristics. The model as presented here does not consider inherent variations in test subject properties. Inclusion of the boundary conditions provides a partial means of making the response of the model specific to a given test subject. The evaluation of the model response to a simulation where boundary condi- tions are included must necessarily be performed by comparing with the response of each individual test subject. However, when boundary conditions are not considered, the model is universal and a single simulation is representative of any measured data obtained under similar test condi- tions. For this reason, the frontal and side hit simulations where boundary conditions are ignored will be compared only with tests 76T056 (frontal) and 76T065 (side). The results of the frontal hit simulation are presented in Figure 15. The simulated acceleration responses of the sternum and ribs agrees with the measured data slightly better than the response of the model when boundary conditions are included. There is, however, more residual vibration after the initial impact response for the no boundary condition case. The impactor acceleration reaches the same magnitude as the measured data when boundary conditions are ignored, but the acceleration returns to zero sooner than for the more complete simulation. Likewise, the simulated intrathoracic pressure decays more rapidly and falls to a small extent into the negative side. The inability of the impactor acceleration to sustain itself for the necessary period produces a variation in the force-deflection response. Even so, the loading portion of the force-deflection curve shows good agreement. The response of the model with no boundary conditions to a side hit is shown in Figure 16. The sternal and rib accelerations again agree reasonably well with the data but not as well as when boundary conditions were considered. The simulated spinal acceleration in the direction of impact is larger than the measured value but of the same duration. The spinal acceleration perpendicular to impact exhibits a ringing behavior not evident in the measured data. As was the case with the frontal case, the impactor acceleration follows the loading curve but then falls off early. This severely affects the force deflection curve which deviates from the typical sustained high force as the thorax compresses. The simulated pressure response follows the same overall pattern for no boundary conditions as was presented for the boundary condition case. As with other responses, there is more residual vibration present. The difficulties apparent in eliminating the boundary conditions appear to center on two characteristics. First, the unrestrained model is easily accelerated by the impactor and is moved out of its way, thus permitting the impac- tor force to decay sooner than desired. This indicates that the model does not resist the inertia of the impactor sufficiently. This resistance to motion can certainly be accommo- dated by including boundary conditions as was shown. A second means of accomplishing the same objective is to increase the total mass of the model. The increased mass could provide the necessary inertial restraint to extend the duration of contact between the impactor and the model. The total mass of the thorax in the model is 7.7 kg (17 lb) which is significantly less than the total thoracic mass of 28 kg (61 lb) recommended by Lobdell (8). However, the proper distribution of this additional mass is not clear. Lumping a 20 kg (44 lb) mass at the spine gave only slightly better impactor response. Also, exactly how much of the restraint is due to a boundary condition and how much can be attrib- uted to a mass of the cross section has not been established. To the extent that a boundary condition can be represented as a an increased mass, then such an approach is justified. The second aspect of the no boundary condi- tion model response deserving attention is the residual vibration present in the accelerometer responses. This could be significantly reduced by increasing the damping in the model. The damping could be increased either linearly or nonlinear ly. Unfortunately, the literature 710</page><page sequence="12">o o i i i i in .... 1 1 « 1 N i i i ^4 .... 1 1 « 1 SmuloMon SwÍmHm» 0 CS» §- X""-- in / N * - S" l' ' lo I ' gS" / r^J _ f ''X' ~o';v I I r^J _ ' - A / »3- / v v^' / - - s '' y / i v ^ ' ^ &lt;§ s 'v/ i K¿¿ ° ^ T- ' , ° V "&gt; 1 " 0 Sj i ( ( ( ? 00 200 «&lt;£? . . 60.0 80.0 100.0 'o.O 20.0 40.0 80.0 80.0 100.0 Time (ms) . .

CONCLUSIONS - The most important conclusion regarding the thoracic ring model is that it can be used to simulate both frontal And side impact. Specifically, the response of the model compares reasonably with both accelerometer data and force-deflection data. Admittedly, the quality of agreement between the simulation and data for all orientations and impact speeds is not uni- formly good. This is not necessarily viewed as a limitation in the model, however, since the magnitude of the data signals where poor agree- ment was observed are very small and may be indeterminate. Moreover, the front and side quasi-static loading curves match measured data. Thus, the thoracic ring model is applicable to a wide range of speeds in at least two directions (front and side) . The utility of the model in oblique impacts has not been determined. It should again be noted at this point that the thoracic ring model does not change its form or its parameters during the simulation and thus is not applicable beyond the point where injury first occurs to the load carrying structures. Specifically, the model is not valid after rib fracture occurs. An injury option could be included in principle by using the current model up to the time of injury and then shifting to another model although the form and parameters for the "injured" model have not been developed. An interesting result of the modeling work is that the pressurization of thoracic cavity during impact contributes to thoracic kinematics. The inclusion of the internal pressure calcula- tion appears to supply a restoring force to the rib structure and an energy loss by way of fluid flow damping. Experience with this modeling program shows that these contributions can not be accomplished simply by increasing rib stiffness and damping values. The model suggests that intrathoracic pressure should be considered in thoracic modeling. The model does not simulate well the intra- thoracic pressure in side impact. Specifically, the measured pressure is positive throughout the impact whereas the simulated pressure starts out negative before it becomes positive after a few milliseconds. Even though this occurs, the simulated pressure stays within the range of the measured pressure. The geometry of a two dimen- sional ring structure could certainly be expected to produce negative pressures early during an impact. The fact that the model produces nega- tive pressures indicates that either the three dimensional geometry of the thorax contributes to the pressure response or that the measured pressure is not typical of the average pressure throughout the thoracic cavity. Thus, although the measured and simulated pressures do not agree for side impact, it is not clear that this is a severe deficiency in the model. One of the important concerns encountered in any thoracic modeling effort is the location and distribution of the thoracic mass. In the human body, a significant portion of the mass is distributed around the chest wall at the ribs, spine, sternum, and the associated muscles and tissues. In addition, the lung and heart contri- butions cannot be ignored. In this model, all components of the thoracic mass were lumped at the elements defining the chest wall. The ability of the model to simulate the data con- firms that lumping the mass on the thoracic wall is acceptable. It is clear from the geometry of the rib cage that the ribs have the opportunity to rotate downward during a frontal impact and to a lesser extent in a side impact. The extent of this rotation has not been measured experimentally. The success of the thoracic ring model in simu- lating the data suggests that the ribs do not rotate significantly or that if they do, the effect on kinematics is minimal. Limiting the model to two dimensional motion would then be a plausible restriction. This conclusion could be confirmed by better measurement of rib motion and intrathoracic pressure distribution during impact.
