This model is an alternative to the readings of hasidic spirituality offered by Scholem and his students, and that of Buber. Scholem saw the raising of sparks as an ecstatic annihilation of the world within its transcendent source. Buber had represented hasidic engagement with material reality as a sac- ramentalizing of the world. The author charts a different course contending that hasidic practice follows early kabbalistic spirituality in advocating a mystical praxis that draws divine blessing into the cosmos. For these writers the material world is the ultimate site for divine creativity and the focal point for the labors of the mystical adepts; while they do want to integrate their spiritualized perception of the material world into the transcendent paradigm, they reaffirm the value of the multifariousness of the material world as the locale of divine presence and recipient of divine blessing. The current renaissance in the study of Hasidism finds its intellec- tual and spiritual origins in the reclamation of hasidic spirituality in the early 20th century within a small coterie of journalist-intellectuals, two of the most noted being Hillel Zeitlin and Martin Buber. Where Zeitlin used hasidic thought as a means of resolving the religious cri- ses of his youth spawned by personal tragedy and the encounter with * Editor's Note: Seth Brody died almost three years ago at the age of 40, long before his time, leaving this article and other projects unfinished.

Viewing all reality as animate with sparks of divine light, the Hasid strives to know God in all of his ways. That is to say, the hasidic devotee engages in a process of holy conversation with the entirety of material reality, striving to uncover within all things an inner spiritual core which sanctifies and ennobles the "here and now"-the present moment-rather than annihilat- ing it through a vision of indwelling divine light. It is within this sanctification of the present moment that the Hasid encounters the divine. 1 In the early 1960s, Gershom Scholem launched an extensive cri- tique of Buber's interpretation of Hasidism.2 In particular, Scholem IFor Zeitlin's struggle with the issues of personal and corporate theodicy and their partial resolution, after a lengthy immersion in the writings of Nietsche and Spinoza, through his adult rediscovery of the mystical mythos of the exile and suffering of the Shekhinah, see Zeitlin's autobiographical comments, "Qisur Toldotai," published as an Introduction to his Sifran shel Yehidim (Jerusalem, 1979), pp. 1-4, and the studies of Simha Bunam Urbach, Toledot Neshamah Ahat: Hillel Zeitlin-ha-Ish u-Mishnato (Jerusalem, 1953), pp. 18-78, and Moshe Waldoks, Hillel Zeitlin: The Early Years 1894-1919 (Ph.D. diss., Brandeis University, 1984), pp. 29-94. In his early study, He-Hasidut le-Shitoteha u-Zerameha (Warsaw, 1910), Zeitlin presents Hasidism as a spiritual path which transcends the pain and duality of material existence through the discovery and recognition of hidden sparks of divinity residing within and uniting the seemingly differentiated world of phenomena. See Urbach, pp. 89-111 and Waldoks, pp. 164-204 for a detailed discussion of Zeitlin's interpretation of the hasidic tra- dition.

Friedman notes that Buber's mature, "relational" interpretation of Hasidism makes its first appearance in his postwar essay "The Spirit and the Body of the Hasidic Move- ment" (1921). There Buber presents Ein Sof 's primordial act of simsum, the contraction and self-withdrawal providing room for the manifestation of the cosmos, as deriving from a divine need to give rise to "the other" and provide for the possibility of love, relationship and sharing. Cf. M. Buber, The Origin and Meaning of Hasidism (New York, 1960), pp. 113-149. 2Scholem's critique finds its major literary formulation in his essay "Martin Buber's Interpretation of Hasidism" published in his collectanea The Messianic Idea in Juda- ism (New York, 1974), p. 243f. Friedman relates that the young Scholem wrote Buber in October 1921 praising him for his publication of hasidic sources, but questioning his ahistorical presentation of the material and his insensitivity to their extensive de- pendence upon kabbalistic theosophical doctrine and values.

Rather, Hasidism originates in a profoundly acosmic vision of reality. In the experience of illumi- nation, God proves to be "all in all" and material reality and the present moment are indeed annihilated in the overpowering vision of the immanent divine light. The scholarship of the past quarter century, particularly the work of Rivka Schatz, has essentially followed Scholem's acosmic and non-dual4 depiction of Hasidism and its mystical praxis. In her foun- dational study, Hasidism as Mysticism, Schatz presents the praxis and theology of the circle of R. Dov Ber, the Maggid (Preacher) of Miedzyrzec as being distinguished by a radical non-duality and spir- itualizing bent.5 Focusing provocatively upon the relation between the infinite and the finite and the claim ein mesi'ut bil'ado (there is no existence save God's), it presents mystical experience as a merger of human consciousness with its divine counterpart in which the ego's sense of distinct and separate existence is annulled. Nonetheless, the hasidic quest for a life of intimacy with the di- vine cannot be restricted to hitpashtut min ha-gashmiyut, the res- toration of the material cosmos to its divine roots in order to give nahat or tacanug (comfort or delight), to the divine. I wish to 3A useful reformulation of the issue of the content and purpose of the hasidic tale is provided by Karl E. Grozinger, "The Buber-Scholem Controversy about the Ha- sidic Tale and Hasidism-Is there a Solution?" in Gershom Scholem's Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, 50 Years After, ed. Peter Schafer and Joseph Dan (Tubingen, 1993), pp. 327-336. Grozinger suggests that the tales serve as a major source of medi- ation between the doctrine and the values espoused by the hasidic elite and the broader hasidic community and thus do indeed serve as an important expression of mystical teaching and a viable source for the reconstruction of the movement's history. 4By duality, I refer to consciousness' normal vision of a world constituted of dis- crete and independent phenomena, the perceptual field of subjects and objects en- compassing what Buber labels the experiential realm of I-It and the relational realm of I-Thou. By non-duality, I will generally be referring to the dissolution of a sub- ject-object dichotomy and the absorption of self and phenomena in an overarching, transcendent consciousness. 5Rivka Schatz-Uffenheimer, Hasidism as Mysticism: Quietistic Elements in Eigh- teenth Century Hasidic Thought, trans. Jonathan Chipman (Jerusalem, 1993).</page><page sequence="4">6 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW suggest that the hasidic teaching originating in Miedzyrzec evolves in the discourses of such masters as Ze'ev Wolf of Zhitomir (d. 1800) and Kalonymous Kalman Epstein (d. 1823) into a subtle non-dualistic spirituality and praxis affirming the ongoing symbiotic relationship of the One and the Many. This spirituality finds its articulation within a distinctive reinterpretation of the pursuit of holiness. In his Creation and the Timeless Order of Things, Toshihiko Isutsu one of our generation's greatest expositors of Sufi thought, argues that non-dual epistemologies force their practitioners to grapple with the issue of the ontological status and value of differentiated phe- nomena.6 While the vision of the oneness of existence can lead to the deprecation and even denial of the reality of the physical world, it can just as readily produce a spirituality which affirms the unity of the One with the Many, in which material entities prove to possess a spiritual core and dimension. The illuminate cultivates a two-tiered perception of the world in which he or she learns to perceive the manifold phenomena within the light of their cosmic ground. While fully conscious of the uniqueness of each mystical tradition and the culturally-constructed nature of its praxis and its resulting experiences, I nonetheless wish to suggest that the teachings of Ze'ev Wolf and Epstein constitute just such an attempt, in a Jewish framework, to work through the theological and existential impli- cations of the Miedzyrzecan claim that there is "no existence save God's" with respect to the reality and value of material being. This "working through" of the Miedzyrzecan vision of non-duality un- folds within the ideological and practical context of the life of holi- ness. Wolf and Epstein firstly endow holiness with a transcendent ontological status by identifying it with a divine locus, the Sefirah of Hokhmah or Divine Wisdom. Transcending all differentiation be- tween subject and object, all normative categories of space and time, Wisdom is often identified with the Ayin or divine Nought and func- tions as the ineffable yet generative ground of all being, including the human psyche.7 This blurring of cosmological and epistemolog- 6Toshihiko Isutsu, Creation and the Timeless Order of Things: Essays in Islamic Mystical Philosophy (Ashland, OR, 1994). 7For the history of the concept of Ayin in Jewish mysticism and its transforma- tion from an ontic category to a psychic state, see Daniel C. Matt, 'Ayin: The Con- cept of Nothingness in Jewish Mysticism" in The Problem of Pure Consciousness: Mysticism and Philosophy, ed. Robert K. C. Forman (Oxford, 1990), pp. 121-159.</page><page sequence="5">OPEN TO ME THE GATES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS-BRODY 7 ical categories enables Wolf and Epstein to present the attainment of holiness as the union of individual consciousness with divine Wis- dom and the integration of the world within its embrace. Mystical il- lumination originates in the discovery of this non-dual, infinite consciousness dwelling within the boundaries of finite phenomena. Yet the contemplative absorption of soul and reality in its divine source paradoxically sparks their ontological renewal and rebirth. Indeed, the creative reintegration and renewal of the cosmos proves to be one of the fundamental duties of the religious virtuoso when engaging in the life of holiness. Consequently, hasidic teachings con- cerning the pursuit of holiness convey a rich evaluation of the rela- tionship between material reality and its divine ground, culminating in a vision of the cosmic responsibility of the holy individual, who is charged with the task of sustaining the life and well-being of creation. In the hasidic version of non-duality, the integration of the Many into the One ultimately serves to effect its recreation and to suffuse it with blessing. Having focused upon the two opposing foci of a complex dialectic, Buber and Scholem have thus provided us with only partial accounts of the ultimate telos of hasidic spiritual- ity. This paper strives to correct this imbalance by providing a preliminary exploration of hasidic notions of non-duality and by exploring their transformation of the life of holiness into a contem- plative, world-sustaining praxis. The Buber-Scholem debate is sufficiently formative to our current understanding of hasidic spirituality to merit recapitulating in some detail, particularly because it is our ultimate goal to direct our concep- tualization of hasidic mystical praxis within a different, less polar- ized framework. As one of this century's greatest proponents of existentialist spir- ituality, Martin Buber, in his mature writings, presents Hasidism as a this-worldly, life-embracing and passionately anti-ascetic religious movement. Where the early Buber, writing before World War I and the publication of I and Thou, emphasized the monistic aspects of hasidic thought, his mature writings contend that the Bacal Shem Tov taught that all phenomena, imbued as they are with holy sparks, are simultaneously possessed of their own unique and ineffable value and meaning and are capable of serving as portals to the perception of the eternal Thou. One must consequently interact with all reality in a mode of "holy congress"-a state of reverent receptivity in which the infinite value and transcendent dimension of phenomena might</page><page sequence="6">8 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW be revealed. Rather than annihilating the world in mystical rapture, such a receptivity cherishes it in all of its concreteness and physi- cality. The true meaning of serving God in all of one's ways, of wor- shipping through material things, is the discovery of the presence of an embodied and manifest sacrality within the world. In I and Thou, Buber writes eloquently about those moments in which the presence of the eternal shines through a worldly object, paradoxically affirming it in its specificity and value rather than effecting its annihilation. In the context of a passionate denunciation of the pursuit of unitive experience, in which individual ego is merged into the abyss of the divine, Buber argues that ". . . the cen- tral reality of the everyday hour on earth, with a streak of sun on a maple twig and a glimpse of the eternal Thou, is greater for us than all enigmatic webs on the brink of being."8 This perception of the eternal Thou in everyday experience, through sensitive and non- exploitative interaction with one's peers and natural phenomena, is presented by Buber as standing at the heart of the hasidic spiritual praxis. Buber's Hasidism affirms divine transcendence conjoined with its "conditioned immanence": Hasidism is no pantheism.... The world is an irradiation of God, but as it is endowed with an independence of existence and striving, it is apt, always and everywhere, to form a crust around itself. Thus, a divine spark lives in every thing and being, but each such spark is en- closed by an isolating shell. Only man can liberate it and rejoin it with the Origin: by holding holy converse with the thing and using it in a holy manner, that is, so that his intention in doing so remains directed towards God's transcendence. Thus the divine immanence emerges from the exile of the "shells."9 Nature is a realm which awaits humanity to perform its hallowing. However, while this hallowing manifests the divine presence hidden within it, unifying the two realms of heaven and earth, it also affirms the infinite value and meaning of the created realm in which God de- sires to dwell. Buber concludes the above-quoted passage: "The task of man, of every man, according to the hasidic teaching, is to affirm 8 Martin Buber, I and Thou, trans.

Speaking in 1961 at the Institute of Jewish Studies of University College, London, Gershom Scholem delivered a scathing critique of Buber's existential interpretation of hasidic spirituality, based primar- ily upon his reading of sources originating with the Bacal Shem and the disciples of R. Dov Ber, the Maggid of Miedzyrzec. 11 According to Scholem, rather than culminating in the valuation and sanctifica- tion of Buber's "here and now," the phenomenal moment and place in which an individual is situated, the contemplative discovery of holy sparks in material phenomena leads to the world's ecstatic annihila- tion within its transcendent source. The here and now does indeed present a valuable opportunity for meeting between God and man, but such a meeting can occur only where man tears open another dimension in the here and now-an act which makes the concrete disappear.... The here and now of concrete existence is not identical with that which shines forth from it once it has become transparent.... For it is not the concrete reality of things that appears as the ideal result of the mystic's action, but something of the Messianic reality in which all things have been restored to their proper place in the scheme of creation and thereby been deeply trans- formed and transfigured. 12 Where Scholem admits that the contemplative integration of mate- rial entities into their divine ground might possess a transfigurative dimension, he tends to emphasize its annihilative characteristics. When phenomena "are restored to their proper place in the 'scheme of creation,"' concretion and temporality vanish. To demonstrate his point, Scholem recounts a discussion between the Bacal Shem Tov and a contemporary, related by Ze'ev Wolf of Zhitomir, a student of Dov Ber of Miedzyrzec. In the account, the Bacal Shem Tov's acquaintance relates that in prayer, he binds his soul to the vital energy of all created things, and uniting with them, loBuber, "Way of Man," p. 127. 11 For a complete discussion of the events surrounding this debate, see Friedman, Buber: The Later Years, pp. 280-299. 12 G. Scholem, "Martin Buber's Interpretation of Hasidism," in The Messianic Idea in Judaism, p. 243.</page><page sequence="8">10 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW directs his intention to God so as to penetrate the highest strata of the spiritual worlds. The Bacal Shem retorts that if such was indeed his practice, he would destroy the world, for he would have directed its animating energy back to its divine source and left it an empty shell. The Bacal Shem Tov reveals that such annihilation is indeed within the power of true contemplative prayer and that his colleague had not yet achieved this goal due to his own lack of faith in its power. In Scholem's opinion, pursuant to successful contemplative activity, the world and concrete consciousness are only restored to their orig- inal concrete status and structure due to humanity's limited ability to sustain uninterrupted immersion in a mystical state of consciousness. Nonetheless, the primary goal of mystical praxis is precisely this temporary annihilation of reality within its transcendent ground, a state as close to messianic reality as humans can reach in an un- redeemed world. 13 The scholarship of the past quarter century, particularly the work of Rivka Schatz, has substantially upheld Scholem's depiction of Hasidism as an acosmic tradition. Hasidic theology, particularly as it coalesces in the circle of R. Dov Ber, focuses provocatively upon the relationship between the infinite and the finite-the spiritual and material dimensions of existence. 14 In Dov Ber's teaching, prior kab- balistic theosophy is radically simplified. Where kabbalistic sources spoke of the manifestation of the divine through a hierarchy of ten emanated sefirotic forces, Dov Ber depicts the Absolute under the guise of an infinite, non-dual consciousness, Wisdom (Hokhmah), which generates the world through its creative vitality (hiyyut). Dov Ber presents mystical illumination (devequt) as commencing with the mind's perception of the material world as permeated with and 13 Scholem, "Martin Buber's Interpretation of Hasidism," p. 242. 14 See in particular, Joseph Weiss, "Contemplative Mysticism and 'Faith' in Ha- sidic Piety" in his Studies in Eastern European Jewish Mysticism (New York, 1985), pp. 43-55; Rivka Schatz-Uffenheimer, Hasidism as Mysticism: Quietistic Elements in Eighteenth Century Hasidic Thought, pp. 168-214; Rachel Elior, The Paradoxical As- cent to God: The Kabbalistic Theosophy of Habad Hasidism, trans.

Arthur Green, Tor- mented Master: A Life of Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav (New York, 1979), pp. 285-336, presents Nahman's thought as originating precisely in his inability to attain this per- sonal experience of the divine as immanent within the created realm standing at the center of the spiritual vision espoused by his great-grandfather, Israel Ba'al Shem.</page><page sequence="9">OPEN TO ME THE GATES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS-BRODY 1I1 animated by this creative vitality of the divine, often perceived as in- dwelling light. This experience is often designated as bi.ttul ha-yesh (the annihilation of reality). In his meditative experience, the Hasid perceives material phenomena as displaying this immanent radiance and ultimately dissolving into its refulgence. Furthermore, bittul ha-yesh, the vision of the world irradiated by divine light, proves to be but the first stage in the mystical trans- formation of human consciousness. When delving deeper into the structure of the mind and cosmos, the mystic discovers that this cre- ative energy arises out of a more primordial level of divine reality, Hokhmah, or Transcendent Wisdom. Wisdom serves as the genera- tive ground of all reality, ranging from the divine vitality animating the universe to the human mind and physical phenomena. Encoun- tering Wisdom, human consciousness loses its sense of individuated existence as a distinct self and merges with its transcendent source. 15 15 The Maggid's conception of divine Wisdom is a creative appropriation of prior -kabbalistic ontological speculations originating in the early 13th century. Catalonian authors such as R. 'Azriel of Gerona carefully distinguish between the first Sefirah, Keter, and the second, Hokhmah or Wisdom. Following a Neoplatonic hierarchiza- tion, Keter is depicted as the primordial movement of creative will within the divine and designated with the apophatic marker Ayin or Nought. Transcending all defini- tion, it eludes all attempts of semiotic denotation. Hokhmah, on the other hand, is the beginning of Yesh or Being, for it bears within itself the seeds of the sefirotic realm, the spiritual and material universes and the deepest levels of human consciousness. Thus, Hokhmah. is the generative core of all being immanent in all existing things, yet transcending their particularity. R. 'Azriel notes: "That Thought which is the root of all in truth and rectitude is designated 'Wisdom,' for she is the potentiality of every- thing which might possibly exist, simple potential engraving the forms of the es- sences subject to change, grasping them in its capacity as a whole grasps its parts." (R. 'Azriel of Gerona, Commentary on Talmudic Aggadot, ed. Isaiah Tishby, [Jeru- salem, 1982], pp. 146, 42b). Implicated throughout all the rungs of reality as their in- ner, generative power, it nonetheless retains its distinctiveness. Given Hokhmah's hylic nature, often paradoxically envisioned as a fecund privation, Dov Ber's circle will often conflate it with the Ayin or Nought. As an example, see Maggid Devarav le- Ya'akov, ed. Rivka Schatz-Uffenheimer (Jerusalem, 1990), p. 60, quoted in Krassen, Devequt and Faith in Zaddikim, pp. 155-157. [One of the JQR readers noted that the author cites two different versions of Maggid Devarav le-Yacakov and recommends that the edition by A. I. Kahan (Jerusalem, 1971) be used. See Z. Gries, "Hasidism, The Present State of Research and Some Desirable Priorities," Numen 34 (1987) 196- 200. I was unable to obtain the Kahan edition for comparison.

It has long been affirmed that as a movement of spiritual renewal, Hasidism was distinguished precisely by this overwhelming vision of divine immanence, the sense of leit atar panoi mineih-that all re- ality originates in and is permeated by the hiyyut ha-borei mammash, the true light and vitalizing energies of the creator. The hasidic rev- olution originated in the Ba'al Shem Tov's ability to perceive eternity in a grain of sand, and his realization that the fullness of creation literally constitutes the divine presence. The essence of the Besht's enlightenment is encapsulated in the insight of R. Moses Teitelbaum of Ujhely (1759-1841) concerning the nature of the burning bush viewed by Moses at Sinai (Exodus 3). In his sermonic collection Yis- mah Moshe, he informs us that Moses did not encounter a specially created bush but only viewed the divine vitality inherent in all things. The miracle was in the seeing, the opening of human consciousness to the true nature of things. 16 Hasidic immanentism possesses profound antecedents in the prior kabbalistic tradition. The notion that the entirety of being, from the innermost depths of divine will and consciousness to the farthest reaches and most minute aspects of material reality, constitutes one contiguous reality was formulated by such great masters of Spanish kabbalah as Moshe de Leon and Joseph Gikatilla, and transmitted to Eastern Europe in the tightly argued mystical treatises of the two great masters of 16th-century Safed, Moshe Cordovero and his dis- ciple Abraham Azulai.17 But this mystical insight was lived with startling engagement in the circle of the Ba'al Shem Tov. The fierce loyalty conferred upon the Bacal Shem by rabbinic disciples possess- ing academic training and pedigrees far superior to his own seems to have derived precisely from his ability to convey to them living access to this experience. 18 16 See Yismah Moshe, Noah, quoted in Louis Jacobs, "The Uplifting of Holy Sparks in Later Jewish Mysticism," in Jewish Spirituality, ed. Arthur Green (New York, 1987), 2:125. 17 See Gershom Scholem, Kabbalah (Jerusalem, 1974), pp. 144-152 for a discus- sion of the tensions existing between pantheistic and theistic notions of divinity in kabbalistic thinking from the 13th through 18th centuries. 18 This would seem to be the meaning underlying the hagiographical account of R. Dov Ber's first meeting with the Ba'al Shem transmitted in Shivhei ha-Besht, p. 62. In their first interview, the Ba'al Shem is depicted as requiring Dov Ber to read and</page><page sequence="11">OPEN TO ME THE GATES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS-BRODY 13 The power of such experiences and the ambivalent attitudes which they can engender towards the material world and physicality is revealed in one of Dov Ber of Miedzyrzec's homilies focusing upon Gen 2:9, "The tree of life in the midst of the garden." Dov Ber begins his remarks by quoting the advice of Elijah de Vidas' Re'shit Hokh- mah that when studying or praying, the devotee should imagina- tively situate himself in the Garden of Eden, where the first human existed alone, in order to avoid succumbing to self-satisfaction and interest. Addressing his auditors, Dov Ber points to the seeming ab- surdity of the practice, for it is very clear that all of us are situated explicate a passage of an early Merkavah text. Rejecting Dov Ber's interpretation, the Ba'al Shem recites the text in a state of awe and near ecstatic trembling, triggering Dov Ber's entrance into a state of transformed consciousness, marked by the vision of lightning flashes and fire and the audition of disembodied voices. For the possible impact of Merkavah traditions upon early hasidic ecstasis and a thoughtful discus- sion of this passage, see Naftali Loewenthal, Communicating the Infinite: The Emer- gence of the Habad School (Chicago, 1990), pp. 217-220, n. 24. Loewenthal argues that the ongoing influence of the Merkavah tradition of heavenly ascent and angelic conjuration is evidenced in Shivhei ha-Besht's relation of the youthful Ba'al Shem Tov's attempt to conjure the Prince of the Torah through the practice of fasting and ritual immersion reminiscent of the procedures described in Hekhalot Rabbati. Sim- ilarly, in a letter to his brother-in-law, Gershon Kutover, published in Jacob Joseph of Polonnoye's Ben Porat Yosef (Koretz, 1781), pp. 100a-b, the Ba'al Shem describes two Rosh ha-Shanah ascents in the years 1746 and 1749 to the heavenly Garden of Eden and the Messiah's palace in order to defend his people against epidemic. The Bacal Shem presents such visionary ascents as representing a normal practice in his spiritual life while Shivhei ha-Besht (p. 41) relates an account of yet another ascent on Yom Kippur to preserve the integrity of the Oral Torah. While zoharic sources are replete with descriptions of the nocturnal ascent of the souls of the righteous to heav- enly academies in order to study with the souls of departed sages and the Besht's con- temporary R. Elijah b. Solomon Zalman of Vilna is reported to have made such ascents regularly, the Bacal Shem's take place within the framework of conscious pneumatic activity and psycho-theurgic conjurations (hashba'at 'aliyat neshamah) profoundly reminiscent of Merkavah practice and intimating its continued influence upon Eastern European mystical life (see Loewenthal, pp. 6-8). For visionary ascent in the Zohar, see Elliot Wolfson, "Forms of Visionary Ascent as Ecstatic Experience in the Zoharic Literature," in Gershom Scholem's Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, pp. 227-233. Our knowledge of the Gaon's inner life is derived from Haim of Volozhin's introduction to Elijah's commentary to the Sifra di- Seni'uta (Vilna, 1820), where he expressly reports that both these nocturnal ascents as well as Elijah's visions came spontaneously rather than as the result of meditative experiences. For translation and commentary, see R. J. Zwi Werblowsky, Joseph Karo: Lawyer and Mystic (Philadelphia, 1977), pp. 311-316.

Yet such perception comprises a lesser level of human consciousness; it is indeed possi- ble for the true devotee to enter into the Garden. When an individual studies or prays in awe and love, adhering to and binding his thought to the Creator, pondering that the "fulness of the earth is his Presence", and that "there is no place free of him," that everything is filled with the vital energy of the Creator, it follows that everything which he sees is nothing but the vital energy of the Creator drawn into that thing.... Everything has a shape or a use to which it is suited, appearance or smell. And everything is the vital energy of the Creator. It thus follows that when an individual studies or prays in fear and awe, he is exceedingly attentive and mindful of this. Because he is exceedingly bound in his thought to the Creator, he does not hear or see anything but the vital energy of the Creator which is in everything. For all comes from him, save that it is garbed in various garments. How can there be any inclination towards worldly desires when all a person sees before him is the vitality of the Creator and the spiritual delight which resides in all things. 19 The fundamental approach to materiality sparked by this teaching is exemplified by a homily from the circle of R. Dov Ber, transmit- ted by his disciple Solomon of Lutsk. Commenting upon Ps 118:19, "Open for me the gates of righteousness. I will enter praising God," Solomon states: We perceive our world as material and coarse only because we chase after empty goals and physical desires. However, if we are discerning and adhere to the pleasantness and sweetness of the light of God and the constant performance of his commandments, this world is proven to be good and valuable. For then, in every place, one sees nothing but the sweetness and the pleasantness of the vital energies (hiyyut ha- borei) of the Creator, his Name be praised. As it is written: "You give life to all." (Neh 9:6) [And as it is stated in the Zohar (3:225a):] "You fill and surround all worlds." In every place one can commune with the Creator of the world, "for there is no place free of him." The entire world, then, is nothing but a portal and gate to perceiving and com- muning with God. This is what David meant when he wrote (Ps 118:19): "Open for me the gates of righteousness. I will enter them praising God." He was 19Maggid Devarav le-Ya'akov, ed. A. I. Kahan, p. 270.</page><page sequence="13">OPEN TO ME THE GATES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS-BRODY 15 saying, "May every place that I look and gaze upon be a righteous portal through which I might enter." From this verse we can establish the principle that he saw nothing before him save God.20 Solomon of Lutsk's homily is a tapestry woven out of the fun- damental slogans and prooftexts of hasidic theological discourse. In the hasidic vision of the divine, deity "gives life to all" (Neh 9:6). For in the formulation of the Racaya Mehemna, "it fills and sur- rounds all worlds." Thus where the ignorant perceive a world com- prised of discrete and material phenomena, the mystical devotee finds "a righteous portal" opening to the perception of the divine light inhering in all things. The Psalmist's phrase shacarei sedeq (the gates of righteousness) is, in itself, a mystical allusion. Sedeq, or Righteous- ness, is a scriptural cognomen for the Shekhinah who is the portal of the upper sefirotic realms. When viewed from a spiritual perspec- tive, the world becomes a door to the divine portal and the fulness of illumination. Yet this homily also displays elements of a negative evaluation of physicality and the normative perception of the world. It is indeed material and coarse and only proves to be of value when the devotee abandons the pursuit of egocentric goals. Only then is the indwelling light perceived and the world's true, non-material value revealed: "...then this world is proven to be good and valuable. For then, in every place, one sees nothing but the sweetness and the pleasantness of the vital energies, hiyyut ha-borei, of the Creator." These sources demonstrate that a definite acosmic tendency, the experience of the natural world permeated and even absorbed in its divine ground, plays a significant role in at least one modality of mystical illumination within hasidic circles, as Scholem and Schatz amply demonstrate. Indeed, the contention that the infinite light of divinity enters into finite manifestation so that the'human soul can taste the experience of infinity engenders a daring reinterpretation in early hasidic circles of the old Safedian liturgical-contemplative for- mula: le-shem yihud qudsha berikh hu' u-shekhinteh. Accepting the zoharic contention that the goal of halakhic praxis is the redemp- tion of the divine Presence from her exile and her unification with Tiferet, the masculine pole of sefirotic reality, the Safed masters ordained that every ritual activity be preceded by the recitation of the 20 Solomon of Lutsk, Dibrat Shelomo (Zolkiew, 1848), Shemini, 2:25-26.</page><page sequence="14">16 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW meditation: "For the sake of the unification of the Holy One, praised be he and his Presence." The formula serves to focus the devotee's intentionality upon his cosmic obligations while freeing his worship of any semblance of self-centeredness or desire for personal reward. Elijah de Vidas instructs the devotee:2' Before a person begins to perform some act of unification he ought to recite the following out loud: "I am fulfilling this commandment in order to unify the Shekhinah and the Holy One, blessed be he...." When he walks to the synagogue to pray the morning service a person should say: "I am about to unite the Shekhinah with the Holy One, blessed be he, by means of the right hand."22 He should also have this intention in mind while reciting other prayers and performing other precepts. 23 Redirecting the Safed tradition's acute messianism and passionate devotion to the exiled Shekhinah towards a transformative spiritual- ity of personal illumination, Dov Ber's circle identifies the divine Presence of the formula with the plenitude of souls and sparks which have undergone mortal birth and embodiment. Constituting the She- khinah's finite manifestation, they must be raised back to the Holy One, their infinite source and mode of existence. This claim often appears within the framework of homiletic com- ments on Deut 10:12, "And now, Israel, what does YHVH your God request of you save to revere YHVH your God." In these homilies, the tetragrammaton is interpreted as referring to the transcendent as- 21 Sefer Re'shit Hokhmah ha-Qasar, ed. Jacob Poyetto, in Safed Spirituality, trans. and ed.

The physical action thus anagog- ically symbolizes and theurgically triggers the intradivine union of male and female. See Safed Spirituality, p. 191, n. 30; Zohar 1:129a-b, 3:55a and 81a; Isaiah Tishby, Mishnat ha-Zohar (Jerusalem, 1975), 2:436-440. 23 It has been determined that the first attestations to this practice appear in the writings of Cordovero's and Isaac Luria's disciples, particularly Haim Vital's Sha'ar ha-Misvot and de Vidas' Re'shit .Hokhmah.

From a transformative perspective, the verse conveys the command to unite this aspect of immanent deity/innermost self with its transcendent source: For the soul(s) of the righteous are the limbs of the divine Presence, as it were. This is [the meaning of] the unification of the Holy One, blessed be he with his Presence and YHVH your God. That is to say: "To the tetragrammaton, which is the Holy One, blessed be he, should be [conjoined] your God"-your soul power which is his Presence. 24 From one perspective, the verse conveys an absorptive valence. It is a call to cognize the truth of non-duality, to realize that the soul is a spark of the Shekhinah's being which is to be unified with its source. Simultaneously, the verse bears an emanational dimension. Once united with the divine, the soul is to invoke the energy of the transcendent Godhead into itself, reliving the experience of its personal creation: "Each and every person should draw forth the light of Keter into the divinity that truly resides within him, that is, that aspect of the illumination of Malkhut [the Shekhinah] which is within his soul."25 It is my contention that when we focus only upon the powerful depictions of individual and cosmic absorption and annihilation in the divine, we receive an incomplete picture of the teloi of hasidic spir- itual practice and the extraordinary richness of its spirituality. When dealing with the goals of contemplative prayer, classical kabbalistic sources differentiate between the activities of yihud and berakhah, unification and the bestowal of blessing upon the cosmos. Classical kabbalah is, in essence, a spirituality and a mystical praxis of cosmic blessing. The mystical adept enters into the divine realm in order to draw its light in a purer and more refined form back into the cosmos, 24 Or Torah and Or Saddiqim, p. 30, in Israel Klapholtz, Sefer Torat ha-Maggid (Bnei Brak, 1976), p. 234. See also Arthur Green and Barry Holtz, Your Word is Fire: The Hasidic Masters on Contemplative Prayer (Vermont, 1993), p. 47, and notes. It is interesting to note that the Bacal Shem Tov's presentation of the unification of Malkhut and Tiferet within the framework of this formula transmitted in Liqqutim Yeqarim (Jerusalem, 1981) essentially follows the early Safedian conceptualization. 25 Liqqutei Torah, Va-Ethanan, in Klapholtz, Torat ha-Maggid, p. 234.</page><page sequence="16">18 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW becoming an active partner in the work of creation.26 So too, hasidic homiletic literature argues that the discovery of the divine vitality animating all material desires and aspects of reality and their unifi- cation within their transcendent roots ultimately culminates in their regeneration in an enhanced form via the contemplative intentional- ity of the hasidic adept. This sense of the twofold intentionality of the hasidic adept is clearly enunciated in Dov Ber's own teachings, a particularly explicit text appearing in Or Torah, Ki Tisa'. Dov Ber's homily is rooted in the biblical vision of a world generated by divine speech as recounted in both Genesis 1 and such Psalm texts as Ps 33:6, "By God's words were the heavens made, all of their hosts by the breath of his mouth." This conception of the verbal origin of the cosmos captivated the rabbinic imagination, giving rise to R. Hoshaiah's de- piction of a world constructed in accord with the blueprint of cosmic Torah. It also serves as the foundation of Sefer Yesirah's explorations of the manner in which the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alpha- bet serve as the building blocks for reality. In these texts, the word is the medium through which cosmic wisdom assumes shape and form. Divinity essentially cognizes and words the cosmos into being, divine speech serving as the essence of all discrete phenomena. Hu- man consciousness mirrors the process when its non-dual foundation enters into and takes linguistic form. Dov Ber's homily is founded upon the Beshtian conception of prayer as "entrance into the word." The contemplative atomizes the words of the liturgy, visualizing their letters and entering into each one with full concentration and ardor. In the process, the differenti- ated structures of consciousness and cosmos are both restored to their source in the divine. The entirety of an individual's intention in prayer and study should be to raise the words to their roots, above from below. The twenty-two letters of the Torah existed from the onset of creation. As it says in the 26 This terminology seems to originate with the early 14th-century kabbalist Mena- hem Recanati, working in part from the Midrash ha-Ne'elam to Ruth. See Recanati, Perush la-Torah (Jerusalem, 1961), pp. 82a-b. However, this notion of the twofold in- tentionality of prayer is present in kabbalistic spirituality from its origins in Provence and Catalonia. For a detailed discussion, see Seth Brody, Human Hands Dwell in Heavenly Heights: Worship and Mystical Experience in Thirteenth-Century Kabbalah (Ph.D. diss., University of Pennsylvania, 1991), chap. 4A-B.</page><page sequence="17">OPEN TO ME THE GATES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS-BRODY 19 Zohar: "God created the world through the Torah"-these are the Torah's twenty-two letters. From them derive the emanational outflow of all of the worlds and their existence-of all creatures from the worlds above to the worlds below.27 God words into being the linguistic consciousness of humanity which anagogically images and participates in the mystery of the divine name YHVH. Divine Thought (the yod of the Tetragrammaton/ Wisdom) emanates breath (the heh of the Tetragrammaton/Under- standing), breath gives rise to sound (the vav or Tiferet) and sound to speech (the final heh or the Shekhinah). So too, human thought, in its progression into speech transforms breath into sound and sound into words. Embodying the linguistic foundations of the cosmos, the offering of the lips raises the entirety of the cosmos back to God: Similarly, an individual must raise the words to their roots, from below to above. An individual adheres to God and conjoins word to word, sound to sound, breath to breath, thought to thought, these being the four letters of the divine name; when a person does so, all of his words soar above to their root. The individual causes the words to come before God who gazes upon them. In this manner a person's prayer is answered. For gazing is a form of emanational overflow from above to below.28 Dov Ber presents prayer as a process of psycho-physical absorp- tion into the Divine. How else does human consciousness express it- self save through thought, sound and enunciated word? What is the gateway to states of transformed consciousness save mental visual- ization and the control of breath? Prayer deconstructs the process of creation, restoring the fourfold structure of the human being to its corresponding roots in the transcendent name. Dov Ber's image of the words' ascent is a daring reinterpretation of earlier mystical sources which are transformed from images of ascent to those of ontic participation. On one hand, they originate in rabbinic images such as the angel Sandolfon collecting the words of Israel's prayers and binding them into crowns for the head of God enthroned. God's examination or gazing (histaklut) upon the words of prayer is resonant of zoharic passages in which words of halakhic and mystical exegesis soar up to the divine throne, receiving the 27 Sefer Or Torah / Rimzei Torah, pp. 58b-59a. 28 Ibid.</page><page sequence="18">20 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW sanction of a divine kiss and transforming themselves into celestial firmaments. Yet, unlike the zoharic usage, Dov Ber's image is ontic rather than mythic. In zoharic sources, histaklut or istakluta desig- nates a visionary experience in which the devotee both envisions and participates in the divine. Transferred to the divine perspective, gaz- ing designates a process of reintegration and renewal. The esoteric dimension of this gazing is intimated by the rapidly shifting termi- nology which veers from Neoplatonic imagery of the words' resto- ration to their roots, to the theistic image of an enthroned God, and the final and definitive explication of the process as "emanational overflow from above to below." The divine sees from within rather than from without, knowing all things as part of its essence. Thus, its seeing constitutes an act of recreation. When the Holy One flows forth, the worlds are sustained. Above, there is neither duration nor time. In one instant, the overflow pours forth, from the supernal font which constantly flows. God's nature to bestow benefit-to overflow to God's creatures. This occurs, provided that the receiver is worthy. If he prays or studies Torah in this manner, he be- comes a channel or that supernal font, which emanates and flows forth beneficently to him and the world as a whole.29 The Maggid thus creates a mystical dialectic of ascent and renewal. The world is restored to a divine realm which is experienced as an endless and ever renewed source of creative power and fecundity. God's beneficence is precisely the never-ending bestowal of being upon creation. The ultimate goal of the Master of Prayer is integra- tion into this font of life, in order to channel its energies back into the cosmos. True to his calling as a preacher, the Maggid creates an elaborate parable to explicate the dual nature of the contemplative's calling: its desire to lose itself in the divine and its obligation to be reborn and reemerge as a living channel for the bestowal of continued life and being within the world. Dov Ber's parable focuses upon an individ- ual who desires to water his fields from a far-away spring. To fulfill his goals, he lays an irrigation channel, which he must keep clear of blockage and protect from ruptures. The spring is the Divinity's infinite attributes of compassion which it showers upon the worlds. 29 Ibid., p. 59a.</page><page sequence="19">OPEN TO ME THE GATES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS-BRODY 21 The irrigation channel is nothing less than the mystical adept "who has made of himself a channel that the overflow might pour through him to all of the worlds." In order to preserve his status, he must con- stantly examine himself to ward off alien thoughts and self-interest. For should he succumb to vainglory or ego, his pneumatic conflu- ence of good and evil might very well draw divine energy into the demonic shells. However, "if he exerts caution in all of these mat- ters, he will, in himself, become a channel from above to below, adding strength to the heavenly household, arousing heavenly mercy and will. Through him, all of the worlds will be granted abundance." An individual who continually cultivates "a pure and clear conscious- ness, attached above," is transformed into a vessel capable of contain- ing the waters of heavenly blessing which sustain all of the worlds. For all of the Maggid's avowed acosmism and his school's detailed descriptions of a world all but annihilated in a sea of divine light, we see that he cultivates a highly dialectical, two-tiered mystical praxis of ascent and return. One enters into the word, "adhering to God, conjoining word to word, breath to breath, sound to sound, thought to thought," raising reality to its roots so that the Holy One might "flow forth and the worlds sustained." Robert Gimello, a prominent student of Buddhist thought and meditative practice, reminds us that mysticism is not merely the pursuit of transformed states of consciousness but rather an ideolog- ically driven and carefully demarcated lifestyle profoundly rooted in the history and theology of its host tradition. The Mahahayana monastic practitioner is firstly a follower of the Boddhisattva path, pursuing a life of egoless compassion and graciousness directed to- wards the liberation of all beings. His rigorous contemplative praxis serves to sustain that lifestyle. Gimello substantively critiques the stance that mysticism "constitutes an autonomous and self-contained realm of human experience, . . . essentially separate from the contexts of culture, history, tradition and discipline in which it is found . . . possessed of its own independent rules, values and truths."30 Gimello's comments are of significant value to students of Hasid- ism.

However, for all of their creativity, they remain profoundly immersed and shaped by the literature of kabbalistic theosophy, the spiritual classics of the Safed renaissance and above all else, the zoharic literature, whose exegesis permeates their discourses. For, as we have mentioned above, the founders of Hasidism are the heirs of what can only be described as a spirituality of cosmic blessing. The classical kabbalistic tradition presents mys- tical praxis as a process of entrance into the divine, in order to serve as a living conduit for the infusion of its creative energy into the cosmos. This spirituality of cosmic blessing is enunciated in the writings of Isaac the Blind and carefully adumbrated in the writings of the Gerona circle of Spanish kabbalists in the early 13th century. This circle conceives of mystical illumination in terms of mahashavah deveqah-thought adhering to Divinity, the merger of human con- sciousness with the world of Divine consciousness, Hokhmah. This conjunction, as Moshe Idel has demonstrated, is often described in the language of ontological union, human and divine thought be- coming one entity.31 Yet, devequt, or the attachment of human con- sciousness to its transcendent ground, is not limited to the blissful annihilation of the ego through its merger with the Divine. Geronan sources present spiritual life as a dialectical process of union and blessing. R. 'Azriel of Gerona interprets Ps 134:2, "Raise your hands towards the sanctuary (qodesh) and praise the Lord" as alluding to the ascent of mind to its source in divine Wisdom, the sefirotic "sanc- tuary." From there, it invokes an influx of vivifying energy into the uni- verse. The mystical quest, in a kabbalistic milieu, has generally been seen as an act in the service of the cosmos as a whole.32 Transmitted to Eastern Europe through the literature of Safed, this model of mys- 31 Moshe Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven, 1988), pp. 46-47. 32 See R.

In the popular and even in the academic literature exploring the nature of mystical consciousness and language, one often encounters insufficient rigor when exploring the conceptual ap- paratus and experience of non-dual modes of consciousness. Non-dual symbolic systems and experiences are evidenced in most of the world's extant religious traditions. Despite Isutsu's observation that non-dual perception can generate divergent attitudes toward the reality of the world, one often finds strong tendencies to blur the distinctions be- tween these symbolic systems and experiences in the name of a uni- versal philosophia perennis. Non-dual perception is generally depicted as the dissolution of egocentric consciousness and the differentiated world within a greater framework of transcendent being. Such indeed is the definition with which we have been working until now, for it represents a reasonable verbal representation of the acosmic aspects of hasidic mystical perception. Yet, this definition of non-duality as merger of self and world within a greater whole hardly exhausts the richness and variability of this rare modality of consciousness. In his monograph Nondual- ity: A Study in Comparative Philosophy, David Loy argues that the 33 The writings of the influential Safed kabbalist, Moshe Cordovero, serve as a major conduit for the transmission for the Geronan model of contemplative practice to Eastern Europe, and propound a vision of mystical prayer permeated with their spirit. In Pardes Rimmonim, Gate 32:1, ed. Munkacz (Jerusalem, 1961), 2:78a, Cor- dovero defines the righteous soul as "a portion of divinity above ... bound up in the cords of love through the roots of his soul, which ascends through all of the worlds and rungs ... if he concentrates in his properly focused thought through the path of the rungs to unite the corresponding sefirotic gradations, each loop will adhere to the other ... on his account, the Sefirot will be united and bound in a mighty bond and ... he, through his soul, will become a mighty cord connecting them....." Follow- ing his prior Catalonian sources, Cordovero states that when the adept "adheres to his Creator in his ideas . .. his soul will ascend and rise from rung to rung and from cause to cause, until God pours upon him a great infusion. He will be a foundation and resting place for this infusion, and from him it will be apportioned throughout the world" (78b). For further discussion of Cordovero's profound influence upon early hasidic thinkers, see Bracha Zak, "'Iyyun be-Hashpa'at R. Moshe Kordovero 'al ha- Hasidut," Eshel Be'er Sheva 3 (1986) 229-246.</page><page sequence="22">24 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW non-dual forms of consciousness arising in Asian traditions take on varied forms. Dualized consciousness arises from the imposition of binary categories upon the field of sensory perception and egocentric intentionality upon action. In contrast, Loy charts three distinctive modalities of non-dual experience: "the negation of dualistic thinking, the non-plurality of the world, and the nondifference of subject and object."34 The first category is the negation of binary thought, of di- viding the world into such oppositional categories as being/nonbeing, life/death, good/evil, deconstructed in such wide-ranging sources as the Mahayana Prajnaparamita or Perfection of Wisdom Literature, Madhyamika dialectic, and the wonderously humorous and paradox- ical stories and puzzles of the Chuang Tzu Book.35 The non-plurality of the world asserts the indistinction and contiguous interpenetra- tion of all natural phenomena. The non-duality of subject and object points towards the dissolution of boundaries between observer and the field of perceived phenomena in which the center of conscious- ness undergoes a state of universalization outside the parameters of the individuated self.36 These non-dual modes of perception can often coincide. The perception of the non-plurality of the world is often accompanied by the dissolution of subject/object differentiation. However, in reality, these modalities of non-dual being can be lived in significantly distinctive ways. The Advaitin Vedantist and the Zen practitioner perceive the world's non-plurality in remarkably differ- ent manners. The Advaitin, in deep meditation, uncovers a luminous and all-pervasive core consciousness which reduces his normal per- ception of the world to the status of near illusion. On the other hand, the Zen practitioner, who denies the existence of a core self, de- constructs his normal sense of dualized consciousness and selfhood, stymies the normative flow of categorical discourse and merges his decentralized consciousness into the field of perceived phenomena. These are perceived "just as they are," without the normative super- structure of form and name. With the Advaitin and Zen practitioner we encounter significantly different models of non-dual awareness, which are shaped by prior philosophical preconceptions informing each tradition's specific meditative praxes. 34David Loy, Nonduality: A Study in Comparative Philosophy (New Haven, 1988), p. 17. 35 Ibid., p. 18. 36 Ibid., p. 25.</page><page sequence="23">OPEN TO ME THE GATES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS-BRODY 25 Similarly, arising in a tradition affirming the reality of divinity and soul and functioning within a framework of cosmic blessing, the hasidic teachers in the circle of the Maggid develop their own dis- tinctive modalities of non-dual perception. In the Maggid's circle, the non-dual experience is predicated upon egoless entrance into the foundational structures of consciousness and cosmos. These are dis- covered to originate in a common transcendental source, divine Wis- dom. Such illumination serves for the benefit of the entire cosmos, for the devotee is transformed into a living conduit for the manifes- tation of creative energy into a world which is renewed rather than annihilated. Within this framework non-dual action is activity pur- sued in harmony with the underlying vision of divine Wisdom, in order to imbue all things with blessing. The identification of this merged vita contemplativa et activa with the pursuit of holiness is derived from the Gerona circle of kabbalists. In their descriptions of mahashavah deveqah, they perceived Hokhmah as the transcendent sanctuary, the holy place to which the mystic must ascend in order to attain union with the holy rung of consciousness sustaining the world. Consequently, the disciples of the Maggid equate holiness with life in accord with Wisdom. Its acquisition is transformed into a path which is both contemplative and active, in which the Hasid learns to perceive and experience the non-dual unity of phenomena within the divine and acts to sustain their existence. Let us now turn our atten- tion to a more detailed analysis of this vision of holiness. Hasidic notions of holiness draw deeply from the wells of their kabbalistic predecessors. These, not surprisingly, are founded upon the rabbinic conception of sanctification as a matter of perishut, ascetic withdrawal and self-constraint, and its transvaluation to the interper- sonal realm through the imitation of God's ethical attributes, culmi- nating in the sanctification of the divine name. However, kabbalistic sources extend holiness' conceptual and ontological boundaries by defining it as the human invocation of Divinity's life-giving energies into the world through the structures of halakhic praxis and ethics.37 This conceptualization of holiness reflects the kabbalistic contention 37 In rabbinic sources, we find various definitions of human holiness, ranging from sexual continence (yYev 2.4) or the practice of restraint even in the realm of permis- sible activities and desires (Midrash Leqah Tov, Qedoshim) to the acquisition of a state of sanctification deriving from adherence to the dicta and rituals of the halachic tradition as a whole (Sifra, Qedoshim 10.2). In contrast to these ethical readings of</page><page sequence="24">26 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW that creation is incomplete, left distorted and imperfect as the con- sequence of human sin but nonetheless amenable to tiqqun, or repair through righteous actions. 38 Furthermore, it is a reflection of the fact that kabbalah is a spirituality of cosmic blessing, using both mystical holiness, a homily preserved in Tanhuma, Qedoshim 5 presents sanctity as a state of ontic assimilation to God. "'You shall be holy!' Why? 'For I am holy.' For I have affixed you (hidbaqti etkhem) to My loins! As it says (Jer 13:11): 'For just as a loin- cloth is affixed to the loins of a man, so have I affixed the entire house of Israel to Myself."' Where Maimonides, emphasizing the uniqueness and transcendence of God, valorizes the ethical dimension of holiness (see Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah 5.11 and De'ot 5.7 and 13), and presents it as originating in the human im- itation of God's world-sustaining activities (see Guide 3.51), the kabbalistic concep- tualization is clearly indebted to Midrash Tanhuma's contention that sanctification is a process of literal assimilation to divine being. For further discussion of the tension existing between the ascetic and life-affirming aspects of rabbinic spirituality, consult Steven D. Fraade, "Ascetic Aspects of Ancient Judaism" in Jewish Spirituality, 1:253- 288 and David Biale, Eros and the Jews (New York, 1992), pp. 33-59. 38 The conception and terminology of tiqqun, the process of cosmic restoration and repair standing at the heart of Lurianic spirituality in the 16th century, originates in rabbinic liturgy and already plays a significant role in the writings of such promi- nent 13th century kabbalists as Joseph Gikatilla and Moses de Leon. The phrase le- taqqen 'olam be-malkhut shadai, "to perfect the world into the kingdom of God," ap- pears in the Musaf service for Rosh ha-Shanah in the context of a prayer calling for the manifestation of God's glory in the world and the universal abolition of idolatrous worship and the acceptance of divine kingship and monotheism among humankind. In the rabbinic text, the initiative for this act of redemptive transformation lies with God. 13th-century kabbalistic thinkers reformulate the notion of tiqqun, placing both the responsibility for the world's shattered state and the initiative for its reconstruc- tion into the hands of human agency. In the first chapter of his sefirotic symbolary, Sha'arei Orah, Joseph Gikatilla describes a cosmos whose primordial unity, in which the upper and lower worlds "were included in one another and filled by one another," has been shattered by Adam's fall only to be repaired and realigned by Moses' construc- tion of the wilderness Tabernacle described in Exodus 40. See Sefer Shacarei Orah, ed. Joseph ben Shelomo (Jerusalem, 1970), 1:65-66. Similarly, the zoharic corpus (2:215b-216a) presents contemplative prayer as effecting a fourfold act of cosmic tiqqun or rectification. Commencing with the moral and spiritual perfection of the in- dividual, it weaves the personal, natural, angelic and sefirotic dimensions of reality into a cohesive tapestry, culminating in the "rectification" and unification of the divine name throughout "the totality of the worlds." Gikatilla's depiction of the tabernacle as a recapitulation and restoration of the "work of creation" proves to originate in a pre- scient reading of Exodus 40.

Lucid exemplification of the kabbalistic conception of sanctity is provided by R. Elijah de Vidas, a significant figure in the 16th-century Safed renaissance. In his widely-read guide to mystical spirituality, Re'shit Hokhmah, de Vidas argues that there are two fundamental dimensions to the pursuit of sanctification. Holiness commences as a moral discipline, marked by abstinence from physical desires and pleasures and by the acceptance of self-imposed limitations upon personal activity extending even beyond the normative restrictions of the halakhic tradition. The Jew achieves such goals through his observance of the negative commandments, which serve to channel and control physical desire. Within this framework of restraint and self-sanctification, the devotee creates a space into which the light of divine holiness can enter, invoked by the performance of the positive commandments. Their performance enwraps the soul in the same garment of heavenly light that will serve as its garb in Paradise and transforms it into a dwelling place for the divine presence. Hasidic notions of holiness originate in a subtle but significant transformation of such mystical teaching in the circles of the found- ing figures of the movement, R. Israel Bacal Shem Tov (d. 1760) and his great disciple R. Dov Ber of Miedzyrzecc (d. 1772). Where earlier kabbalistic writers attribute the shattered state of the world and the attendant experience of human suffering to Adam's historical fall, these hasidic thinkers conceive of it as a mind-born delusion generated by a human consciousness mired in egocentrism and self- aggrandizement. Human holiness consists firstly of the unfettered perception of the holiness and the creative power of divine Wisdom animating the cosmos, which is achieved by the hasidic devotee when he annuls his sense of existence as an individuated self. Transcend- ing all dualistic differentiation between subject and object, all norma- tive human categories of space and time, Wisdom is often identified, as mentioned above, with the Ayin or divine Nought, and functions as the ineffable yet generative ground of all phenomenal being, in- cluding the human psyche. If divine Wisdom serves as the immanent ground of all terrestrial phenomena, then the fundamental goal of religious praxis-the attainment of illumination-consists in the ex- perience of all things as encompassed with its light, and the pursuit of life's fundamental activities while remaining in this state of aware- ness. The pursuit of holiness becomes the acquisition of a state of non-dual consciousness, in which world, self and divine consciousness</page><page sequence="26">28 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW merge into one single state of decentered, all-encompassing cosmic awareness. Beautifully enunciated calls to participate in precisely this type of contemplative lifestyle appear in the homilies and behavioral dicta (hanhagot) of such significant second- and third-generation hasidic masters as Ze'ev Wolf of Zhitomir and Kalonymous Kalman Epstein of Krakow. Their vision of holiness as a contemplative lifestyle and non-dual modality of perception finds expression in their recorded homilies to the opening verses of Leviticus 19. In the context of a homily on Lev 19:1-2: "You shall be holy for I, the Lord your God, am holy," Kalonymous Kalman Epstein speaks eloquently concerning the nature of a spiritual life founded upon the perception of divine Wisdom dwelling within the world: The Holy One created all of the worlds in Wisdom, as it is said: "You have made them all in wisdom, the entire world is filled with your cre- ations." (Ps 104:24) This is its interpretation: The rung of Wisdom is the first of the worlds, for concerning Keter nothing at all may be said, as is known from the Lurianic writings. Wisdom is the soul of all of the worlds, extending to the lowliest point in the bowels of the earth. Anyone desirous of perceiving divinity must perceive its Wisdom from all of the world's creatures. For the Wisdom of God may be perceived even from the lowliest creature. An individual contemplating the divine Wisdom inhering in all of the world's creatures can attain a state of adhesion to Supernal Wisdom and from it draw forth all of the goodly emanations-that is the won- ders of Wisdom (pel'iot hokhmah). For all things are created through, subsist and are sustained within God's Wisdom-God bestowing upon them the vital energy through which they derive their perdurance. Life, progeny and sustenance-all of the goodly emanations-derive from there (Qoh 7:12): "Wisdom vivifying its possessors."39 In this passage, Epstein engages in an intensely mystical rereading of the medieval philosophical tradition. Medieval Jewish philosophy, in both its Neoplatonic and Aristotelian currents, was marked by a distinctive cosmological focus, finding within the order and intelli- gibility of the cosmos the imprint of the Creator's rationality and wisdom, and proof of his unity and incorporeality. The second chap- ter of Bahya ibn Paquda's Duties of the Heart, one of Andalusian 39SeferMa'or va-Shemesh, Qedoshim (Jerusalem 1986), 1:318.</page><page sequence="27">OPEN TO ME THE GATES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS-BRODY 29 Judaism's great spiritual classics and a text widely read in Eastern European mystical circles, adumbrates the manner in which the dev- otee must examine every aspect of created being from the structure of the heavens to the intricacies of human physiology in order to dis- cover within them the workings of divine Wisdom. Epstein subsumes these philosophical insights into a mystical ontology. More than the stamp of divine rationality apparent in creatures, Wisdom is "the soul of all worlds," through which all things are created and sustained. From an intellective and emotive enterprise, contemplation of the wisdom manifested in the world evolves into a state of transformed consciousness. The devotee advances from appreciation of divine intelligibility manifested in the cosmos, to the perception of the cre- ative energies through which it is sustained and assimilated, to the non-dual consciousness from which all reality derives. Nor is this "ascent" described as a process of annihilation or negation. Wisdom is a font of blessing, the source of "life, progeny and sustenance," viv- ifying its possessors. Adhesion to Wisdom would thus seem to pos- sess a generative dimension, bestowing upon the devotee the ability to confer blessing upon himself and others, a point to which we will return in due course. This assimilation of the quest for holiness with the perception of cosmic Wisdom comprises a significant element of Epstein's inher- itance from the generation of his teachers, the disciples of Dov Ber of Miedzyrzec. In his homilies to Genesis 1, R. Ze'ev Wolf of Zhit- omir contends that divine worship is based upon the recognition that all material things originate in divine Wisdom to which they must be restored: It is reliably known that the Creator made everything in Wisdom. All things possess an allusion to Wisdom, instructing an individual to perceive transcendent lights and spiritual joys from these physical pleasures. Just as they exist in their lofty places so have they been em- anated into the creatures, so that the transcendent might be perceived from the lowly.... When an individual performs all of the details of his deeds in a state of connection and adhesion to God, then he elevates the expansion of pleasures to their root, to the Primordial Thought. For the principle and goal of a person's worship in this world is to raise the multiplicity of pleasures to the true unity.40 40 This citation is taken from a copy at the National University Library Jerusalem (R 8' 70A 983) Or ha-Me'ir, Korets, lb, and another copy in the Scholem Collection</page><page sequence="28">30 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW In these homilies to Leviticus 19, Ze'ev Wolf presents the cultiva- tion of holiness as a two-tiered process culminating in a state of non- dual consciousness. The devotee must first realize that all entities and all psychic phenomena, including his own fundamental sensory functions, derive their vitality from the divine energy inherent in all things. All things possess an allusion to Wisdom, instructing an in- dividual to perceive transcendent lights and spiritual joys from these physical pleasures." Thus every object in the cosmos must be viewed and treated by the devotee in a non-dual manner, as reflecting its transcendent source. Ze'ev Wolf further contends that this contem- plative discipline will develop in time into an actualized state of mys- tical perception, "the transcendent being perceived from the lowly." The righteous are defined as those individuals who possess the clar- ity of intellect requisite for perceiving the supernal radiance imma- nent in material phenomena. They then strip them of their "material form" and clothe them in their suprasensual sources, thus restoring the ultimate unity of all things. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: "Speak to the entire Israelite com- munity and say to them: You shall be holy, for I, the Lord your God, am holy" (Lev 19:1-2). The essence of the intention arising in God's simple will when em- barking upon creation is well known.... Everything came to be for the sake of the pleasure and delight which God expected to derive from the souls of the righteous, for great is their power to liken the form to its Maker. We have already referred to the essence of the power of the righteous many times. That is their possession of a clarity of intellect (behirut ha-sekhel) which perceives the supernal lights which have emanated from the height of the sefirotic rungs (Keter) into the lowest of lev- els-humanity's material pleasures such as eating, drinking, sleeping and other details of this world's pleasures. In their righteous activity, the saintly engage in these endeavors with wisdom and knowledge, in order to perceive the transcendent from the lowly. In place of receiving personal pleasure, they raise this outpouring of lights to their root and source, the place of unity. For the righteous possess the power and there, (R 3204.1).

Of their own accord, they strip away the mate- rial form and enclose it in its spiritual form. This is their "likening of the form to its Maker." 41 An individual who acts in this manner "is to be called holy" (Isa 4:3) And he is worthy of being called holy ... In accord with his qualifica- tion and the attachment of his soul to God, each and every Israelite similarly effects rectifications above and is able to raise the emanation of lights back to the place of their unity. It does not matter whether one does little or much, so long as one's heart is directed towards heaven in accord with the minuteness of his intellect and perception. In any case, he shall be called holy, with respect to his (personal) holiness. For he has sanctified and purified the elements of his senses so that divinity descends upon himself. Thus he acquires for himself the des- ignation of holiness.42 Ze'ev Wolf chooses his language with great care. The determining characteristic of the righteous is their "clarity of intellect" (behirut ha-sekhel). That seems to denote both a cognitive and perceptual awareness of the animating energies of the divine within such mun- dane activities as eating, drinking, etc. Thus, "the saintly engage in these endeavors with wisdom and knowledge," suppressing the ma- terial dimension of such pleasures and activities and focusing instead upon their spiritual core, perceiving "the divinity enclosed in every place towards which they direct their eyes." While the practice seems to commence as a mental discipline, it is eventually described as ma- turing into the literal perception of the immanent light wherever one gazes. Having "purified the senses ... divinity descends upon him." Illumination itself is conceptualized within the framework of me- dieval epistemology. Where normative consciousness strips sensory percepta of their individuated material form in order to cognize the 41 The phrase originates in Genesis Rabbah 27.1: "How bold are the prophets who liken the created form to its Maker" where it refers to the prophetic tendency to envision and describe the divine in anthropomorphic terms. Maimonides reads the exclamatory nature of the statement as demonstrating the rabbis' ultimate adherence to the belief in divine incorporeality (see Guide 1.46). Ze'ev Wolf has, of course, reinterpreted the dictum as referring to the manner in which the mystical adept de- ontologizes material reality, stripping it of its physical garb so that its inner light, its true likeness to its Maker, shines through. 42 Sefer Or ha-Me'ir (Ashdod, 1995), 2:322.</page><page sequence="30">32 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW underlying universal, mystical consciousness perceives the indwell- ing light. It thus "likens the form to its Maker"-" stripping away the material form and enclosing it in its spiritual"-most likely gazing upon the animating hiyyut or vital energy of the divine residing within. In the process it reintegrates the emanated light within the "template" of divine unity. It is precisely this sanctification of the senses and the reintegration of the spiritual core of their percepta that constitutes the praxis of holiness. One is to see all things, at least momentarily, from the perspective of non-dual unity. It is significant to note that two different strata of language inter- act in Ze'ev Wolf's analysis of non-dual praxis and experience. The process begins in an epistemic framework, with a transformation in the modality through which the devotee conceives of, interacts with, and finally experiences the world. Ze'ev Wolf's homily on Genesis 1 quoted above informs us that all aspects of material reality allude to supernal Wisdom. Wisdom exists both "on high" and has been emanated into creatures. This occurs "so that the transcendent may be perceived from the lowly": so that human consciousness can grasp (or be grasped?) by the interpenetration of all levels of reality. In the Leviticus homily we move from the intellective to the expe- riential. The metaphors here are strikingly visual. The elements of the senses are purified: intellect gazes upon the supernal lights in- carnate in the material world. Righteousness is in part the acquisition of the ability requisite to perceive literally the divinity enclosed in every place one looks. The goal, as outlined in the passage from Genesis, is to "raise the multiplicity of pleasures to the true unity," to see the non-dual One underlying the multiplicity of divergent phe- nomena and sensory stimuli and faculties. Yet these homilies also use a second category of metaphors de- rived from an ontological framework, based upon the chain of ema- nation. Supernal lights have descended from above and must be raised on high. Rather than receiving pleasure from material activity, the hasidic devotee is to "raise this outpouring of lights to their root and source, the place of unity." Through their "attachment of soul," they effect "rectifications [tiqqunim] above." A model of non-dual ex- perience and praxis distinct from that of Asian traditions begins to emerge. The hasidic devotee is not simply moving from ignorance to illumination. The lights do inhere in material reality. However, their perception alters more than human consciousness. It reintegrates the immanent light of the divine into its transcendent roots, revitalizing</page><page sequence="31">OPEN TO ME THE GATES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS-BRODY 33 the entire emanative process. Mystical praxis thus draws the world closer to that messianic moment when the boundaries separating the "upper" and "lower" realms will be abolished and the world will be flooded with a divine light accessible to all. This imagery of "rais- ing" or "rectification" seems to be more than a metaphoric descrip- tion of the contemplative process of redirecting consciousness so that one perceives the world and one's activities in the light of their transcendent ground. Rather, it transforms mystical perception into a process of world-renewal in which one raises the immanent divine back to its transcendent source. What precisely does it mean to be holy? While Scholem quotes Ze'ev Wolf of Zhitomir as a major source for his acosmic and annihi- lative interpretation of hasidic spirituality,43 analysis of that teacher's writings show him to assert that the ultimate purpose of the culti- vation of holiness within the context of mystical praxis is the trans- formation into the active dwelling place for divine being and the renewal of creation. Ze'ev Wolf further explores this insight when discussing the mean- ing of the juxtaposition of the call to holiness (Lev 19:2) with a recapitulation of the ban on idolatry (Lev 19:4). He argues that Scripture is alluding to the ultimate challenge facing human exist- ence: either to serve as terrestrial vehicle for the creative force of divine holiness or as a dwelling place for the destructive forces of the demonic, becoming, in short, a living idol: The middle of the human body is called the heart, Zion's point, for from there a person's thought flows. Everything depends upon a per- son's heart. If, through the power of its perception, thought adheres to and embraces the greatness of the Creator, cognizing and recognizing the Creator's greatness-God's infinity and endlessness, the manner in which its light fills and underlies all worlds-then "God is great in Zion" (Ps 99:2). That is to say: God is truly great in that point of Zion in the heart, in the might of its perception.... When a person directs thought to the transcendent majesty of divinity, then that individual becomes a vehicle which plants the dimension of holiness in his midst. The entirety of his person becomes a throne for holiness. On the contrary, when his thought turns to evil, then he and the en- tirety of his person become a throne for the dimension of impurity ... 43 Scholem, "Martin Buber's Interpretation of Hasidism," p. 242.</page><page sequence="32">34 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW and his bodily aspect becomes a graven image for "other gods." . . . This is the meaning of "You shall not make for yourselves graven im- ages" (Lev 19:4)-that is yourselves-the fullness of your persons- of each and every Jew-is transformed into a graven image and the Spirit of Impurity descends upon it. The verse concludes, "I am the Lord your God." That refers to the situation when your innermost thoughts adhere to the transcendent majesty of divinity. They then become a vehicle for the descent of holiness and they draw upon themselves God's lordship and divinity, so that they might be called "the God of Israel." This is "I am the Lord your God."44 Ze'ev Wolf's exegesis of Ps 99:2, "God is great in Zion," is con- structed upon a paradoxical reversal of the reader's expectations. Zion is internalized and transformed into a state of consciousness. God becomes great in Zion when the Hasid perceives the true meaning of divine infinity and non-duality: the mysterious manner in which the creative light of the Absolute "fills and surrounds all worlds," being equally and indistinguishably present in every rung of existence. Such a radical vision of immanence annuls all normative human catego- ries of space and time, revealing the staggering inadequacy of such spatial metaphors as high and low, above and below, immanent and transcendent, when dealing with the divine. When God proves to be all in all, all conceptual and linguistic categories are shattered on the shoals of the undifferentiated One.45 Yet, precisely at the moment where one would expect ego and cosmos to be annihilated by the devotee in an apophatic vision of the ineffable One, Ze'ev Wolf reveals God's true greatness in Zion to consist precisely of a renewed and regenerative infusion of holi- ness within individuated human consciousness and a reaffirmation of creative activity within the realm of the particular. It is only pur- suant to the annihilation of our normal linguistic and conceptual cat- egories that the animating light of the infinite can be perceived. Yet paradoxically, this annihilation of self, cosmos and corporeality must itself be annulled if the true goal of creation is to be fulfilled- the active and creative indwelling of the Infinite within the demar- cated boundaries of the material universe. 44Sefer Orha-Me'ir, 2:330-331. 45 Michael Sells, Mystical Languages of Unsaying (Chicago, 1994), pp. 1-10, 21-22.</page><page sequence="33">OPEN TO ME THE GATES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS-BRODY 35 The symbol of Zion is again pregnant with meaning to the reader of kabbalistic sources. In the zoharic literature, Zion designates Yesod (the conduit of life, energy and souls) to the Shekhinah and cos- mos.46 The raza di-mehemnuta, the mystery and goal of mystical faith and praxis, proves to be the mutual interpenetration and co- existence of divine infinity and corporeal finitude through the aegis of human holiness. When human consciousness truly comprehends the "transcendent majesty of divinity," God having become great in the "Zion-point" of its heart, "then that individual becomes a vehicle which plants the dimension of holiness in his midst." Like the patri- archs before him and the Temple's covenantal ark, the devotee be- comes the terrestrial locus for the indwelling power of the divine. The process culminates in the adept's divinization as he takes on the designation "God of Israel," and as the "righteous pillar of the world" functions as Yesod's human manifestation. The devotee who has attained this state of non-dual awareness in which "God is great in Zion" is charged with a cosmic mission. When examining the issue of holiness, Ze'ev Wolf turns his atten- tion to Pereq Shirah (Chapter of Song), an ancient liturgical text enumerating the individual biblical verses recited daily by every creature in the cosmos, from the sun to the field mouse. The proem of the text, speaking through the persona of R. Eliezer ha-Gadol, as- sures a place in the world-to-come for anyone who recites it daily. 47 Ze'ev Wolf attributes the value of the text to the microcosmic di- mension of human identity and activity. Every order of created being possesses both a source in the divine realm and a parallel existence in the human body and psyche in which it is equally contained. 46See, e.g. Zohar 1:158b, 186a, 201a, 256a; 3:11a, 35a, 36a, 148a, 296b (Idra Zuta); Joseph Giqatilla, Shacarei Orah, ed. Joseph ben Shlomo (Jerusalem, 1989), 1:129-134. 47 In the Introduction to his recension of the text, J. D. Eisenstein notes that this pseudepigraphic statement is based upon R. Joshua b. Levi's dictum (San 91b): "Everyone who recites the Song of the Sea (Exodus 15) in this world will have the merit of reciting it in the next." See Osar Midrashim, ed. J. D. Eisenstein, 2: 523. The redactor of Pereq Shirah has shifted the focus of Jewish piety and its redemptive hope from the historical realm to the cosmic, thereby endearing it to mystical circles. [Cf. the comments of Malachi Beit-Arie in his critical edition of Pereq Shirah who finds greater resonance in the hekhalot literature.

And similarly, on the contrary, if he is neither clean nor pure, he and the fullness of his stature from head to ankle are separated and divided from the Creator, be he praised, on account of his evil deeds and moral degradation. And so too, given that he is a microcosm, those aspects of the inanimate, vegetative and animal realms included within him are separated from their source and root. Take this principle to hand, let it be the doctrine concerning humanity which should be brought to one's attention: how the very essences of so many aspects of created beings as well as the inanimate and vegetative rely upon and wait for a person and the direction of his thought. If it is towards holiness, he draws upon them supernal illumination from their holy source. If it is towards the shells, God forbid!, he transgresses twice, causing evil to himself in that he is separated from God and to those aspects of inanimate, vegetative and living being included within and influenced by himself, which are separated from his source.48 Ze&amp;ev Wolf informs his readers that the sages ordained the recitation of Pereq Shirah precisely to reveal its responsibilities to humanity and to enable the illuminate to fulfill them. For when the hasidic adept recites the text while contemplating the vivifying mystical names en- coded in its verses, he draws vitalizing energy into the natural world by connecting the spiritual essences of each phenomenal being with its divine source. By means of this he bestows upon them vitality and perdurance, for they were created in the world for a purpose and every act which a wise man performs is performed in wisdom. Because [the Hasid] radiates light, emanational overflow and transcendent blessing upon the variegated [orders] of inanimate, vegetative and animated being, he is certainly as- sured a place in the world-to-come, for he sustains the world in its fullness.... This is the general principle: if he performs good deeds, in the fullness of his being he becomes a throne for the manifestation of holiness, while through his evil deeds he, God forbid!, becomes a throne for the Other Side.49 Ze&amp;ev Wolf's homiletic analysis of Leviticus 19 reveals a complex yet ultimately well-integrated vision of holiness and mystical praxis. 48Ze'ev Wolf of Zhitomir, Or ha-Me'ir, 1:325. 49Ibid. 1:325.</page><page sequence="35">OPEN TO ME THE GATES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS-BRODY 37 The devotee is indeed instructed to view and deal with all corporeal phenomena and passions within the context of the immanent light of divinity and raise them to their roots in divine thought. Such con- templative discipline enables him psychologically to deconstruct both his normative sense of functioning as an egocentric individual and his attachment to material desires. However, the ultimate goal of such a psycho-contemplative praxis is the transfiguration rather than the annihilation of his vision of a differentiated world. Human conscious- ness and the phenomenal universe are to be uplifted and sanctified, so that the light of the infinite can inhere and shine through them without effecting their dissolution in their divine ground. In the next generation, Kalonymous Kalman Epstein transforms this conception of holiness into an ideological basis for the doctrine of the saddiq. His homily to Lev 19:1-2 proves to be an extensive analysis of a short exegetic dictum attributed to Dov Ber of Mied- zyrzec. Epstein begins his discourse by quoting a homily preserved in Leviticus Rabbah (24.9) querying in God's name: "'You shall be holy.' Can you be like Me? The verse states: 'For I the Lord am holy.' My holiness is superior (lema'alah) to yours."50 Relating an account of a transgenerational conversation so distinc- tive of Jewish exegetical discourse, Epstein notes that in his youth he had heard an interpretation of the midrashic text in the name of Dov Ber of Miedzyrzec which thoroughly inverted its meaning. Given that the word lema'alah carries both a comparative and locative de- notation, translatable as meaning both "loftier than, superior to" and "on high, above," Dov Ber stands "God's" statement on its head and depicts divinity as asserting "my holiness on high is on account of yours." 5' Epstein proceeds to expound upon Dov Ber's statement: When an individual contemplates the divine wisdom [inhering] in all of the world's creatures, for all are created through and sustained within His wisdom-God giving them the vital energy through which they derive their perdurance, he can attain a state of adhesion (de- vequt) to supernal Wisdom and draw forth from there all of the goodly 50 Qedushati lema'alah mi-qedushatkhem. Parallels appear in GenR 2.4 and Mid- rash ha-Gadol's proem to Leviticus 19, ed. Rabinowitz (Jerusalem, 1967), p. 469. 51 Dov Ber also exploits the fact that the preposition mi carries both comparative and causal meanings. The phrase qedushati lema'alah mi-qedushatkhem can legiti- mately be read as both "My holiness is greater than / is superior to your holiness" and "My holiness on high is on account of your holiness."</page><page sequence="36">38 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW emanations life, progeny and sustenance-deriving from there, for "Wisdom vivifies its possessors" (Qoh 7:12). Consequently, when an individual searches out, investigates and seeks the existence of God and sees that everything adheres to Wisdom and [when he] binds the lower Wisdom52 to the higher, establishing a great unity throughout the worlds, he [becomes] that righteous one to whom God has apportioned intelligence and understanding, to bind the souls of mortals as well to their Creator.... Now, it is known that the word holy implies Wisdom, as it is revealed in the Zohar.53 This is the meaning of "You shall be holy"-serving as the vivifying power for Israel, drawing down for them all goodly emanations and insight into the service of the Creator. "For I am holy"-that is to say, "Just as I created all the worlds through the quality of Wisdom, which is called holy, . . . and, which serves as their vital force, so too-should you be holy"-adhering to Wisdom called holiness-functioning as the vital force of all the worlds in order to draw forth goodly emanations from above to below. 54 Epstein's homily provides significant insights concerning the na- ture of divine Wisdom. The fecund ground of reality, "vivifying her possessors," Wisdom conveys the blessings of life, progeny and sus- tenance to all being. The illuminate, who sees all reality sustained through her light, is charged with the task of "binding the lower Wisdom to the higher." He is to raise the material cosmos and the animating power of the Shekhinah (the lower Wisdom) to its ground in the infinite light of transcendent Wisdom. In this manner, the illuminate "establishes a great unity throughout all of the worlds." Given Wisdom's identity as the font of divine creativity, this unifica- tion ultimately proves to be generative rather than annihilative. As the pursuit of holiness is an act of imitatio dei and the holiness of de- ity is identified with its wisdom, the righteous individual is charged to serve as the catalyst for this process of cosmic renewal. He is to "function as the vital force of all the worlds in order to draw forth goodly emanations from above to below." When the cosmos is perceived from the perspective of its divine ground, both the illuminate and the universe undergo rebirth. In 52 The lower Wisdom is the Shekhinah. 53 See, for example, Zohar 3:13a and Re'shit Hokhmah, Shacar ha-Qedushah 7. 54 Sefer Ma'or va-Shemesh, Qedoshim, 1:318-319.</page><page sequence="37">OPEN TO ME THE GATES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS-BRODY 39 particular, the relationship between the devotee and the saddiq is transformed. The illuminate becomes the saddiq, that righteous in- dividual who serves as the vehicle and throne for the Shekhinah's active manifestation within the world and living conduit for the em- anation of divine holiness into the corporeal realm. This, to Epstein, is the ultimate meaning of the Levitical command to imitate divine sanctity and Dov Ber's contention that God's holiness derives from its human counterpart. The vivifying light of Infinity finds unim- peded access to the corporeal realm only when the finite merges selflessly with the Infinite to work the world's regeneration. This quest to integrate "upper and lower Wisdom," the infinite and finite dimensions of being, through the aegis of mystical praxis plays a creative role in hasidic thought throughout its formative period. It reaches its apogee in the metaphysical system constructed out of the Preacher of Miedzyrzec's teachings by two of Hasidism's most subtle thinkers, R. Shneur Zalman of Lyady (1745-1813) and his disciple, R. Aaron b. Moses ha-Levi of Staroselye. Rachel Elior has compellingly charted their paradoxical vision of deity, which simultaneously affirms both the infinite and boundless nature of the divine essence and its inherent desire and need to enter into imma- nent manifestation between the poles of expansion and contraction. 55 In a movement which proves to be both self-revelatory and conceal- ing, the divine takes on the garb of the material universe while still yearning to transcend and annul the boundaries of finite manifesta- tion. This dialectic of sefirotic emanation and return finds its micro- cosmic expression in human consciousness, which uses prayer as a means of stripping reality of its material cover and reintegrating its animating vitality into the "light of the Infinite One" (or Ein Sof) while drawing the Ein Sof 's refulgence back into the cosmos through the observance of the commandments. In his mystical discourses, Aaron of Staroselye reveals that a fun- damental goal of the devotee's vision and deeds is the unification of the infinite and finite modalities of divine being "so that the light of the Infinite One might shine below ... [and] the vessel might be ca- pable of bearing the light."56 This indwelling of the Infinite within 55 Rachel Elior, The Paradoxical Ascent to God: The Kabbalistic Theosophy of Habad Hasidism, trans.

During the intermediate nights of the festival, water would be ritu- ally drawn from the pool of Shiloah, danced to the Temple court and poured upon the altar to the accompaniment of levitical music and exuberant public rejoicing. A nonverbal prayer for winter rain, the rite is interpreted in classical kabbalistic sources as an invocation of the energies of IHesed or divine love into the world. Aaron integrates his meditation upon the metaphysical significance of the ritual into a discussion of Abraham's and Isaac's well digging in the Negev recounted in Genesis 21 and 26. The patriarchs' well digging is presented as an aspect of the revelation of the light of Infinity into material reality. The painstak- ingly discovered water, welling out of the depths of the desert, ana- gogically symbolizes the light of Ein Sof pouring into the physical world in response to the mystical adept's contemplative union with the divine: This is the purpose of creation, to remove hiddenness and concealment, to stand before all opposition from within and without and to reveal that point in the heart that is in each and every Jew as a heritage from our holy fathers ... bringing it forth from concealment to revelation through contemplation and a deepening knowledge concerning the greatness of the light of the Infinite One. This is the meaning of the digging of wells, that is to dig deeply and remove the materiality and concealment which hides the divine light. The activities of the ancestors are a paradigm for their descendants.57 Aaron has developed his own unique terminology to create a sub- tle discourse for non-dual perception. Normal consciousness exists in a state of "opposition from within and without," seemingly the bi- nary dualities of subject and object, and the perception of the world as a field of discrete physical objects. Yet every Jew bears within 7 Ibid.</page><page sequence="39">OPEN TO ME THE GATES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS-BRODY 41 himself or herself a perceptive sensibility or faculty, designated "the point of the heart." In accord with the imagery of pointedness, this sensibility enables the devotee to pierce through the encrustations of materiality and concealment and uncover the divine light inhering at the heart of reality. This perception constitutes the literal purpose of creation. Aaron notes that the patriarchs present two distinctive archetypes for this revelatory process, in which "the point of the heart," the mind's intuitive sensitivity to divine presence, finds its actualization in contemplation. Abraham is valorized by Scripture and the Rabbis as the paragon of selfless hospitality and compassion and identified by the kabbalists as the terrestrial embodiment of Hesed, the sefiro- tic power of love. Aaron presents him as the hasidic adept who draws the light of Divinity into the well. Isaac, on the other hand, as perfect sacrificial victim and paradigm of divine judgement, is the ascetic who spurns and despises materiality in order to be reabsorbed into Divinity. It is known that Abraham is an aspect of divine love as it says, "Abra- ham, my lover" (Is 41:8). His quality was one of delighting in the love of God and drawing divinity into all differentiated phenomena. As it says, "He called upon the name of the Lord,58 the God of the world" (Gen 21:33). He specifically drew that aspect of divinity designated Lord into the world so that it would not seem to be a distinct entity as it appears before our eyes. The quality of Isaac is that of deeds of holy majesty which are fiery flames, burning in adhesion, desire and want for God, his soul thirsting to be truly separated from the wick (the body) . .. Isaac could not stand physicality ... he is thus life's end (qes hai), that is to say he truly de- spised (shiqes) his life. His spiritual state was always that of the coal's fiery flames, ascending of themselves to be absorbed in His light, be He praised, like the candle's light which naturally ascends above to be absorbed into the element of universal fire situated under the sphere of the moon. Because Isaac's quality was that of fiery flames, designated as deeds of holy majesty and harsh judgement, he was able to derive from this true yearning of soul and the annihilation of existence.59 58 The tetragrammaton refers to the transcendent light of the Ein Sof, drawn into material reality through Abraham's activity and dissolving all perception of radical differentiation and distinction. 59Sefer 'Avodat ha-Levi, Qedoshim, 2:15b (third enumeration).</page><page sequence="40">42 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW In contrast to Abraham, who draws divine light into creation, an- nulling the distinction between sacred and profane, Isaac is trans- formed by Aaron into the radical spiritualist and ascetic, so maddened with love and the yearning for things celestial that he despises and abandons all things material. Identified by the kabbalistic tradition with Gevurah, the sefirotic force of justice and retribution, he him- self is imaged by Aaron as a coal's fiery flame, the candle's light ascending by its nature to its elemental source in the currents of pri- mordial fire situated under the sphere of the moon. In Aaron's psy- chologization of the sefirotic system, harsh judgement is transmuted into a state of radical self-denial, the yearning for annihilation in the consuming flames of Divinity. He is the terrestrial manifestation of one of those angels of the Merkavah tradition which are born of heavenly fire and having offered their daily service, are reabsorbed in their fervor into its flames. Thus Isaac's goal is the pure annihila- tion of world and consciousness within Divinity which Scholem sit- uates as the ultimate telos of hasidic mystical praxis. For all of his well-documented acosmic tendencies, Aaron of Staroselye rejects Isaac as the ultimate model for the spiritual life. During the Feast of Tabernacles, kabbalistic ritual practice dedicates each day of the holiday to a major biblical figure and invites him into the Sukkah along with his fellows in the guise of the ushpizin qaddishin, or holy guests. Aaron notes that the "Joy of the Water Drawing" commences on the second night of the festival, which is dedicated to the mystical persona of Isaac. The water libation serves to annul the annihilative focus of Isaac's fervor by presenting a dif- ferent paradigm of spiritual activity, in which the corporeal realm is united with the divine without being deprived of its distinctive shape and finite reality. The water poured upon the altar represents the undifferentiated light of Ein Sof, divine infinity, which suffers nei- ther change nor transformation before or after the emanation of the cosmos and with unaltered power and intensity shines forth as the untouched but hidden essence of every gradation of reality. Although the ground of all reality, its perception eludes human consciousness due to ignorance and its embodiment as part of an emanational pro- cess that generates our differentiated universe. The water offering serves to reveal this hidden, infinite light in such a manner that the world can bear it, "so that the light of the Infinite One might shine below . . . [and] the vessel might be capable of bearing the light." Rather than annihilation, the goal of spiritual praxis is the manifes-</page><page sequence="41">OPEN TO ME THE GATES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS-BRODY 43 tation within the material world of the indwelling yet infinite light of the "Ancient One," which is equally present and absolutely the same (shaveh) throughout all rungs of reality. Nonetheless, the existence of the worlds will not be annulled, although from the perspective of Isaac, in accord with the paradigm of "mighty deeds", they could be ... but [rather] when the light of the Infinite One shines forth, both aspects [of reality] will exist: that is the essence of revelation without the annihilation of corporeal reality. As it says, "Is anything too wonderful for me" (Jer 32:37) and, "I am the first and the last" (Is 44:6).6 R. Aaron of Staroselye's metaphysics is thus animated by a pow- erful vision of unity within differentiation. Reality, in all of its com- plexity, arises from and is animated by a changeless divine core which undergoes no substantive change throughout all of its permutations. The cosmos is the product of this infinite being's "desire" to "dwell in the lower worlds," to undergo finite manifestation. Thus the supe- rior archetype is Abraham rather than Isaac: one's goal is to permit the light to dwell within the world rather than sublimate it within the divine Nought. Or better put: the hasidic vision is to view the One within the Many as an interpenetrating and interactive totality. The homilies of Ze'ev Wolf, Kalonymous Kalman Epstein and Aaron of Staroselye do more than reveal the depth of ecstatic ex- perience propelling hasidic teaching and the creative manner in which its discourse transforms biblical injunctions and characters into an inner geography of psychic space and spiritual states. Rather, despite their scorn for unrestrained passion, they express a metaphysic and a spiritual praxis which views the material world as the ultimate locus of divine creativity and presence which the mystical virtuoso is charged to nurture and preserve. The Hasid's final goal is neither the world's annihilation in the vision of the One nor an existential affirmation of concrete reality as it stands in itself. Rather, he is to integrate the perception of the material realm in a spiritualized form into a greater vision of its transcendent source while reaffirming the continued value of differentiated phenomena as the terrestrial dwell- ing place of the Infinite One. A deeper insight into this sensibility 60 Ibid.

It further demonstrates the sub- tlety with which hasidic thinkers outside of the purview of Habad pursued a path of non-dual perception and praxis, which must be charted with sensitivity and care as we strive to deepen our appre- ciation of early hasidic thought and contemplative practice.</page></plain_text>
