Introductory.-The opening years of the twentieth century have witnessed, among other things, the gradual emergence of a new school of philosophic thought, and a new philosophic method. To the former, which originated in America, the name of 'New Realist' has been given. The exponents' of the latter designate it the 'Scientific Method.' New Realism is largely imbued with the spirit of the scientific method, and, for the purposes of criti- cism, the two may be treated together. The new method claims2 to make an entirely fresh start in philosophy, to discover what problems are capable of solution, and to open the road to that solution to those who are willing and able to make the requisite effort. The reason for this new departure in philosophy is not far to seek. The last half of the nineteenth century gave birth to changes in the world of science of a revolutionary nature. To take two examples alone, Darwin's doctrine of Natural Selection and Maxwell's Electromagnetic Theory brought about an entire change of outlook in their respective domains of biology and physics, with a consequent overhauling of all the traditional concepts and principles. It is a commonplace that science and 1 Whitehead and Russell. 2 B. Russell, Our Knowledge of the External World, Lect. I and conclusion of Lect. VIII.

The scien- tific revolution was followed by an upheaval in philosophy. Everything went into the melting pot. There emerged a con- fused mass of opinion following upon the attempt to fit new facts to old systems, which finally settled down into two main tenden- cies of thought, the one clinging as far as possible to a modified Absolutism based on Kant and Hegel, the other launching out more boldly in an attempt to apply Evolution as a comprehensive metaphysical formula. The latter, though now generally dis- credited even by its posterity, was the forerunner of the modern evolutionary and pluralistic schools. While much of the old remained in the new, there was, of necessity, a vagueness both in ideas and in method. Philosophy was numbered with a mass of useless metaphysical cobwebs. Inevitably there arose an increasing demand for a general clearing up with a view to a fresh start. In this demand the newt scientific method finds its motive force, and history is repeating the story of Descartes over again. Schools of philosophy may be classified according as they differ in method or in system. Whichever mode of classification is adopted, the various schools fall, broadly speaking, under two main headings. In method they are Empirical or Rationalist; in system, Pluralist or Singularist. Empirical method and pluralistic belief tend to go together, for if we appeal for the most part to the crude data of sense, we are confronted by a manifest plurality. On the other hand, the craving for unity has con- stantly caused men to mistrust the world of sense with its eternal diversity and flux, and led them to seek the characteristics of the totality of existence by pure thought alone. Hence the method which leads to the singularist or absolutist view of reality is essentially rationalistic. We can best trace the path of progress if we observe the develop- ment and interaction of the two classical methods of attacking the problem. Most great advances in philosophy have con- sisted in a partial synthesis of Rationalism and Empiricism. Kant's work is a supreme example of such a synthesis. The I 'New,' that is, in its particular mode of application of scientific principles to philosophy.</page><page sequence="3">No. 3.1 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 229 type of advance is analogous to that of the Hegelian dialectic. In emerging into antithesis after each successive synthesis, Rationalism ever tends to include more empirical data in the material with which it works, while Empiricism is inclined to stray ever further from the surface of things by building up its data into abstract intellectual constructions, and by framing more or less abstract hypotheses to account for these data. Pluralism, with its genetic method, is the modern outcome of Empiricism. The position of Rationalism is not, at first sight, so clear. One's thoughts turn naturally to the idealism of the Absolutist school; but although the beliefs of this school are upheld by some of the foremost philosophers of the day, they represent an influence which is rapidly on the wane. The true progressive product of Rationalism, despite the fact that its data are mainly empirical, is the New Realism, for its scientific method purports to deal with the form and structure of existence as opposed to its concrete content. The final synthesis of the two points of view consists not in an amalgamation, but in a recognition of the fact that each is neces- sary to the complete fulfilment of philosophic purpose, and in a determination of the particular function, domain, and limitations, of each associated method. II. Outline of Scientific Method.-The scientific method' attacks the problem of the Universe piecemeal. A problem is selected, isolated as far as possible, and an attempt made to clarify our conceptions relating to it, and to determine by con- tinued analysis, the true source of the perplexities underlying the question. The final step, and the most difficult, is to formu- late an hypothesis which will resolve these perplexities. The difficulty of this last process lies in the fact that the necessary hypothesis is inevitably of a peculiarly abstract nature, for at each successive stage of the analysis the matter under considera- tion becomes more abstract. In any particular investigation, the initial data consist in the generally accepted body of knowledge on the subject. This knowledge will almost invariably be vague and confused, and 1 B. Russell, op. cit., beginning of Lect. VIII.</page><page sequence="4">230 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. the task of analysis is to resolve it into a number of definite propositions. The latter, when the ultimate premises have been reached, are arranged in logical sequence. The premises should be stated with the minimum of redundance. They must then be scrutinized in turn with a view to ascertaining the par- ticular degree of doubt or certainty attaching to each. This provides us with a criterion of the doubtfulness or certainty pertaining to each proposition of the sequence, and to the initial data in particular. In general the scientific method makes use of three types of data:' sense-data, the testimony of others, and certain primitive logical truths. In making use of testimony, the existence of other people must be tacitly assumed. It is impossible entirely to justify this assumption. On the other hand, its falsity cannot be established, and it is indispensable in opening up a relatively immense field of knowledge, whereas solipsism is practically barren. One of the most important applications of the scientific method is to the analysis of the meaning of the concepts of physical science,2 and the investigation of their validity as representative of the world of fact. Evidently, the material from which the start must in this case be made, is the data of sense. Since all scientific observation consists in perceiving sequences of sense- data, and since the verification of a physical prediction lies in an appeal to the occurrence of some sense-datum, it follows that if the entities of the physicist are to be valid conceptions, they must be capable of representation as logical functions of sense-data. Even if they be so represented, it does not follow necessarily that they exist concretely, nor does it matter. The importance of such a critique of physical science is great, for the physicist is often apt to consider his entities as the true realities of the uni- verse, regarding them as inferences whereas they are merely constructions. The data of sense are the indubitable concrete facts. The exponents of the scientific method claim that it is capable of ascertaining all that is soluble in the problems of philosophy, 1 B. Russell, op. cit., Lect. III. 2 Ibid., Lect. IV.</page><page sequence="5">No. 3.1 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 23I and of effecting the solution. They regard it as giving the method of research in philosophy just as mathematics gives the method of research in physics. It alone is capable of yielding whatever objective scientific knowledge it is possible to attain.' This is certainly true enough so long as we regard merely the objective side of experience as such. For the task of science is twofold. It has first to record and correlate the particular concrete facts of experience. This is the function of the specialized sciences. But the forms of the particular facts and the general aspects of experience have also to be investigated. This investigation falls to the lot of the philosopher. The things he deals with in per- forming it are therefore essentially abstract. The function of the scientific method, then, though in part constructive, is mainly critical. Its field is the objective side of experience, and its scope is comprised in the determination of the validity of the concepts we apply to this objectivity, and in the solution of certain problems by the construction of other valid concepts and hypotheses. This construction it performs by analyzing the general forms of experience. All questions such as, for example, ethical problems, are therefore regarded as outside the scope of philosophy, for they are considered to deal with the particular characteristics of the particular things composing the world.2 Although the results obtained by the scientific method may be mathematically accurate, and therefore a complete solution of the type of problem with which it deals, it will be seen later that the data from which it starts introduce an element of inade- quacy. Moreover, the question arises as to whether the prob- lems considered are the only ones with which philosophy may legitimately deal. It has commonly been considered that one of the supreme tasks of philosophy is to provide an explanation of the facts of experience. The hypotheses yielded by the scien- tific method are evidently purely descriptive in type. Can any hypothesis, however, be considered explanatory, or are all hypotheses descriptive, differing merely in the entities in terms 1 Op. cit., Lect. VIII, conclusion. 2 All New Realists do not take up this attitude with regard to ethical and ana- logous problems-e. g., R. B. Perry in Present Philosophical Tendencies, Ch. XIV.</page><page sequence="6">232 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. of which the description is expressed? It will shortly be seen that one type of hypotheses may be considered as truly explana- tory in an entirely unique sense. In this connection it is of the utmost importance to remember that there is both an objective and a subjective side to every question. Just as much light will be thrown on a problem by an investigation of the manner in which we have arrived at our relevant concepts on the subject at our present level of experience, as by an investigation of what the precise meaning of the concepts must be, if they are to be validly representative of objective experience. The concepts we have formed may involve unwarrantable assumptions if applied uncritically to objective experience as such, but if their true meaning for us, and the manner in which that meaning has been acquired, are analyzed, not only shall we realize our own nature more clearly, but there is a possibility of the suggestion of fruitful hypotheses as to the nature of existence generally. We are thus led naturally to the consideration of pluralism and the genetic method. III. Outline of Pluralism and the Genetic Method.'-Pluralism is based on the existence of the self. All philosophers do not believe in the existence even of one self. Reasons will be stated hereafter, however, which seem to render doubt on the subject not only logically impossible, but inherently meaningless. The word 'self' will be used as synonymous with 'subject of expe- rience.' All confusion with the various meanings of the empirical self, which relate essentially to the self as conceived, will thus be avoided. For the class of selves or subjects considered in relation to their experience, the term 'mind' will be used. This meaning appears to approximate most closely to the general usage of that somewhat vague term. Starting from matter, i. e., from matter as generally conceived by physics and by the main body of common sense, it is impossible to bridge the apparent gulfs between the inorganic and the or- ganic, and between Life and Mind. Herbert Spencer's work 1 The term 'Pluralism' is used in this article to denote a spiritualistic plural- ism, namely, the view which regards the world as made up of selves or subject of experience.</page><page sequence="7">No. 3.1 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 233 bears eternal witness to this fact. The only alternative, therefore, is to start from Mind and endeavor to work back. This is the endeavor of pluralism. The pluralistic hypothesis is briefly as follows: "Reality comprises selves (i. e., active subjects of ex- perience) alone, differing simply in degree of mentality, though the diversity is indefinitely various." Experience, then, con- sists in action and reaction between self and other selves, de- scribed by Professor James Ward in the expressive phrase " mutuum commercium." The meaning of 'activity' is considered to be fundamentally realized by everybody, but to this point we shall return. The comparative hopes of a solution of the problems of philoso- phy held out respectively by Pluralism and by any form of Materialism, are sufficiently indicated by comparing the start made from the existence of selves as a basis, with that based on the existence of ultimate material particles-atoms, corpuscles, electrons, or whatever they may be considered to be. We know that some selves exist.' Strictly, each of us knows that one self exists; but, as we have seen, if we are to philosophize to any extent worthy of the name, we must take a further step and assume the existence of other selves, nor can this assumption in any way be demonstrated to be false. It is therefore justifiable to make it. On the other hand, even should the material par- ticles of physics actually exist (and this seems very doubtful), we could not know of their existence. The scientific method demonstrates this sufficiently. Moreover, if, as that method shows to be extremely probable, the entities of physics are simply constructions of sense-data, we cannot conceive a self in terms of these entities; for evidently a self cannot simply be a logical function of sense-data. To sense-data we apply the term 'phenomenal,' i. e., 'presented to a subject,' thereby implying that we realize the fundamental distinction in kind between the subject and the sense-data or phenomena which it perceives. It is impossible, therefore, to imagine that we ourselves can be analyzed into sense-data; in fact, the supposition involves a contradiction in terms, for sense-data are 'given' or 'presented' 1 See Section V below.</page><page sequence="8">234 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. by the very meaning of the term, and it is the self to whom they are presented. Admitting, then, the existence of at least some selves, is it possible to explain the facts of experience entirely in terms of selves? As a matter of fact, the explanation has already been partially accomplished, and modern pluralists are engaged in applying it to the remaining difficulties. While at the present stage there seems to be no reason for supposing their attempts will be unsuccessful, many pluralists are of opinion that the bare hypothesis as stated above is incomplete. It seems probable that, for the complete solution of the problem, pluralism must be supplemented by some form of Theism.' However that may be, the pluralistic hypothesis is admissible until disproved by fact, and therefore it is justifiable to continue to apply it as far as possible. It is no part of our present purpose to analyze in detail the application of pluralism to the solution of philosophic problems, but the type of method adopted may be briefly illustrated by a consideration of its application to the case of what is commonly called 'inorganic matter.' The chief feature of that class of sense-data from which we construct the concept of inorganic matter, is the uniformity of the sequences manifested therein. There seems to be no expression of individuality observable. The opposite is true of selves. A self is essentially individual, for it is unique. In fact it is only to a self and its particular experience that we can correctly apply the term 'individual.' Animals manifest individuality and we have every reason of analogy to regard them as selves or subjects of experience. The animal merges insensibly into the vegetable world, and there is little difficulty in applying the pluralistic hypothesis to the latter. Now one fundamental characteristic of mind is its plastic reten- tiveness, which is manifested in the formation of habits. The lower we go in the scale of life, the more habit do we find, and the less spontaneity. The latter, however, and consequently in- dividuality, never entirely disappear. Remembering how narrow is the line dividing the organic from the inorganic, we are led to 1 J. Ward, e. g., Pluralism and Theism.</page><page sequence="9">No. 3.1 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 235 regard the latter as constituted by individual agents of extremely inferior mentality, whose behavior is therefore sufficiently habit- ual to admit, for the most part, of description in general terms. The reason for the apparent absence of individuality is that we are here probably dealing with individuals in bulk, so that our results are statistical. These results will be even more uniform than the majority of statistics, on account of the nature of the individuals concerned; but there is no reason to suppose that, if we could observe the behavior of one of these individuals in isolation, we should be unable to observe any traces of uniqueness. The above is but a broad outline of the pluralist argument as applied to the inorganic world, and if the question is examined in greater detail, many other reasons can be adduced which show that there is nothing incompatible with experience in this view of apparently lifeless matter. The first stage in the growth of a pluralistic philosophy is analytic. It consists in the analysis of experience, perceptual and conceptual, and of those particular concepts which we apply to experience under the name of categories. The investigation leads in all cases to results which suggest a pluralistic hypothesis, although they do not lead to it as a strict logical necessity. The second stage in the process consists in the application of the hypothesis to the solution of the particular problems of existence. In the first stage the investigation takes the form, for the most part, of an analysis of the growth of individual experience, and of the transition by intersubjective intercourse to universal con- ceptual experience. Hence the method employed is genetic. In this way we determine the process by which we have arrived at such knowledge as that of space and time, for example, and at such conceptions as Causality, Quality, and Relation. Thus abundant light cannot fail to be shed on the time-honored prob- lems associated with these names. Pluralism is an hypothesis, and it therefore stands under the universal limitations inherent in the nature of hypothesis in general. For a just appreciation of values, then, it is necessary that these li nitations should be precisely stated and clearly borne in mind.</page><page sequence="10">236 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. We usually look upon hypotheses as put forward to 'explain' certain groups of facts. Let the case of physical science serve as an illustration. As a rule, men of science are content to dismiss the data of sense as merely 'subjective.' They look upon them as due to the action of certain hypothetical entities on our senses. The function of such an hypothesis, however, is not really explanatory, but simply an attempt to describe the facts of existence in the simplest possible terms. The immediate facts of existence are confused, complex, and loosely ordered. Any attempt to deal with them as they stand, for the purpose of calculated interference in the course of events, will be foredoomed to hopeless failure. Consequently, physics introduces such conceptions as those of a material particle and a luminiferous ether, in order to unify and coordinate the phenomena, so as to render them amenable to mathematical treatment. The majority of hypotheses are merely descriptive in this way. They are attempts to describe the facts of existence in simpler terms than the immediately given data. It might therefore be urged that pluralism is also a merely descriptive hypothesis, the 'explanation' being simply taken back one step, and ex- pressed in terms of different things. Yet it is just in this dif- ference of terms that the root of the essential disparity between pluralism and other hypotheses is to be found. It implies a difference of type. For pluralism is expressed in terms of active selves. We all realize what it is to be active-it is just living and doing. We all realize what a self is. This realization is far more than knowledge in the ordinary sense. It is something of what the older thinkers were trying to express when they said that for perfect knowledge, knower and known must be one. It is a unique, supremely intimate fact, and therefore stands in a class of its own. It cannot be subsumed under one of the three types of knowledge proper-knowledge by acquaintance, knowledge by description, and knowledge of logical truths.' It is this last fact which so often causes the realization of the nature and existence of self to be passed by, with the inevitable consequence that doubt is expressed of the existence of self at all. 1 Evidently the subject, or knower, cannot be an object of knowledge.</page><page sequence="11">No. 3.] SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 237 With a clearer view of the facts, such doubt is seen to be inherently meaningless. Moreover, it follows from the above that plural- ism, being expressed in terms of active selves, is truly explanatory for such active selves, i. e., for us. It thus differs in type from all hypotheses which are not expressed in such terms. Although pluralism differs in type from other hypotheses, it is yet bound by certain limitations common to all hypotheses. An hypothesis passes from necessarily partial observations of a system to a description of the system as a whole in space and time, and is therefore inevitably fallible unless the system be assumed capable of complete description in general terms. Any system, however, comprising subjects of experience, is quite incapable of being so described, for the subjects, and the ex- perience of each, are essentially individual and unique. It follows from the above that, as we have at our disposal but limited observations of the world, it would be possible to find an infinite number of hypotheses descriptive of the world, which would sufficiently fit the narrow range of the observed facts. We could not form a unique and infallible hypothesis' unless we knew all the facts, past, present and future, and then it would no longer be an hypothesis, but a mere recital of those facts. The fallibility of hypothesis is sufficiently illustrated by one fact alone, namely, that we have no reason at all to assume that laws which have held in the past will continue to hold in the future, unless we also assume some principle, such as that of induction, which depends on a priori principles of probability. Hence, though we may know an hypothesis to be false if it is contradicted by any fact, we can never certainly know it to be true. All that can be said is that it is more or less probable, the degree of probability depending on its applicability to the facts observed up to that time. Thus any final beliefs as to the con- stitution of the universe cannot depend on knowledge alone, but must be based on faith. In selecting an hypothesis, then, we have a very great range of choice, for no hypothesis is ruled out of court till it fail to account for some fact, or rather, till it be definitely disproved by I I. e., we could not be sure that it was infallible nor that it was the only hy- pothesis which would fit the facts.</page><page sequence="12">238 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. some fact. This being so, we naturally turn, in the first instance, to hypotheses which are truly explanatory. For our purposes an explanatory hypothesis may be formally defined as 'an account of a system which can be formulated symbolically in terms of active subjects of experience.' The conceptual formula as such, which sets forth the hypothesis, is of course, descriptive, but its concrete meaning is explanatory in a sense in which that of a formula in terms of objective things is not. It should be noted with reference to the type of result likely to be obtained from the scientific as opposed to the genetic method, that logical constructions of sense-data can never give a self. Hence, as selves certainly exist, no hypothesis in such terms can explain the universe nor even completely describe it. Pluralism, on the other hand, is not only explanatory, but it also complies with the condition demanded by Occam's razor. Far from multiplying entities, it is expressed in terms of entities certain examples of which we know to exist, and which any hypo- thesis must therefore take into account. IV. Points of Conflict between Pluralism and the 'New Realism.' -The supporters of the new scientific method hold that pluralism cannot be true because the conceptions on which it is based conflict with their results, and are therefore invalid. An analysis of the problem seems to show that the supposed conflict springs in the first instance from two main points of difference. These are the existence of the self, and the true meaning and validity of the categories of experience, particularly those of continuity and causality. The scientific method lays stress on the objective side of ex- perience. It investigates the object of experience, not in relation to the subject, but considered per se, and therefore in abstraction from the subject. It considers what meaning certain concepts must have if they are to be valid when applied to the object of experience thus isolated from the subject. Hence it fails to take account of the fact that the growth of experience consists in action and reaction between subject and object, manifested in an ever-increasing complexity and differentiation of the object, and</page><page sequence="13">No. 3.] SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 239 that the latter is therefore determined in part by the activity of the subject. This activity is a fundamental realization,' but when considered from the conceptual standpoint of Empirical Psychology, it appears to consist essentially in attention. If, then, we are fully to realize the concrete meaning of the concepts we apply to experience, we must examine them in the light of this mutual interaction of subject and object. The consideration of the subject implied in experience brings in its train certain ethical and teleological concepts which are meaningless except in application to such a subject. The failure to take the existence of the subject fully into account in the analysis of experience, thus leads to the inevitable result that certain most important characteristics of existence are entirely overlooked or regarded as invalid conceptions. It is owing to their preoccupation with the objective side of experience that the New Realists look upon the notion of teleology, for example, with such doubt and suspicion. Bertrand Russell2 regards it as possible for a system to be both mechanical and teleological, according to the point of view. Such a supposition evidently entirely invalidates the generally accepted notion of teleology, and we shall therefore examine it hereafter. When concepts applied to experience are analyzed genetically, the meaning of them as thus determined is invariably found to contain more, and to strike deeper, than that determined by the scientific method. The former seems to throw considerably more light on the true nature of existence than the latter. This is illustrated particularly clearly in the case of causality. Experience is a unity, comprising a duality of subject and object, and we cannot fail to get more and more out of touch with its true inwardness, if we lay stress on one side of it to the exclusion of the other; for all separation of subject from object, though necessary to a certain extent for purposes of analysis, is to that extent artificial. The problem of continuity brings out most clearly, perhaps, the difficulties raised by this artificial separation. 1 See p. 250 below, note on 'activity.' 2 "On the Notion of Cause," Scientia, Vol. XIII (I9I3), N. XXIX, 3, p. 333.</page><page sequence="14">240 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. V. The Existence of the Self.-In the course of his analysis of our knowledge of the external world, Bertrand Russell makes the assertion that the (bare) self, if it exists at all, is an inference.' This sentence defines very precisely the general attitude of the new realists. It is somewhat as follows: In any case, the reasons we may have for stating that the self exists can only be arrived at by inference, but even then, it is doubtful whether the inference can be made. As already pointed out, it appears that any such doubt of the existence of self is really meaningless. In the first place, from what may be called the concrete point of view, we certainly cannot know the self from the very nature of the case; but we have instead the central and unique fact of the 'realization' of our own existence. Evidently no general term can adequately express the full nature of a fact so essentially particular; but this is no reason for ignoring the fact-perhaps rather the reverse. As will shortly be seen, we have in addition abundant data from which we can infer the existence of self, but the concrete realiza- tion of its existence is of infinitely greater importance. From the more abstract point of view, psychology traces the gradual growth of the concept of self, from the primitive idea of the body-self, through ever more refined and spiritual stages. Eventually we seem to be coming in sight of the bare active sub- ject of experience, as distinguished from the empirical self in all its phases. By proceeding in this way, however, we can never quite reach the subject of experience (though we may come very near it), for we are here dealing with self as conceived, i. e., as an object of knowledge; whereas the concrete self is the knower. Knowing is a relation between two entities, so that evidently the subject cannot know itself. It simply realizes its own exis- tence, though the formulation in conceptual symbols of the fact of this realization, is itself a piece of knowledge. As Kant pointed out, it follows from the foregoing that the only course open to epistemology is to postulate the existence of the pure Ego, or subject of experience, as a regulative idea. Although we cannot, by continually modifying, and, as it were, 1 Knowledge of External World, Lect. III, p. 74.</page><page sequence="15">No. 3.] SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 24I centralizing the concept of self, arrive at the concrete subject of experience, we may yet infer its existence. The inference is necessarily immediate, for all such terms as 'knowledge,' 'ex- perience,' 'perception,' etc., imply the existence of a subject in their very meaning. Without it they have no significance what- ever. In fact, all psychological discussion inevitably assumes the existence of an individual subject. We cannot speak simply of the existence of thoughts and feelings. There is always the implication of 'one who feels and thinks.' Knowledge and consciousness only possess meaning at all in so far as they are referred to something knowing and conscious of something else.' Experience implies presentation of an object to a subject, thus comprising a duality in a unity. The existence of the subject in this duality is just as much a fact as the existence of the object. The Cogito ergo sum of Descartes was one of the most conclusive inferences ever stated. Some philosophers, following Huxley, have regarded the self as being merely the series of mental phenomena constituting the individual mind. This supposition implies the existence of the very entity which it is attempting to dispose of. For, in the first place, what is meant by the 'individual mind'? Why should the series be individual at all? What gives it its essential characteristic of unity? The fact of presentation to an individual subject is the only possible reason. Moreover, the very word 'phenomenon' implies appearance or presentation to something -to what we call the subject. It is useless to state, as some have done, that even if this be so, the subject may still be merely a logical construction, for this is to lose sight of the fact that the agent which constructs can be no other than that subject which is supposed to be a logical abstraction. Finally, it should be noted that the exponents of the new scientific method continually use the word 'sense-data.' By so doing, they not only assert the existence of experience, but they also, by the very term, tacitly acknowledge that one element of experience is something which is 'given.' But if there be something given, there must be something else to which it is given. 1 See also J. Ward, Art. "Psychology," Ency. Britt.</page><page sequence="16">242 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. To sum up: The existence of experience is a fact, and as such, cannot significantly be doubted. But experience consists essentially in the presentation of an object to a subject, and has no meaning which does not involve the existence of both the latter. The existence of the subject being once granted, proposi- tions can be asserted concerning it. These constitute pieces of knowledge of a kind which has been termed 'knowledge by de- scription.' Such knowledge is fundamentally distinct from that concrete realization of our own existence, which can in no sense be termed knowledge in itself, but which is, for us, the central and most abiding fact of all. The existence of at least one self being granted, we proceed to assume the existence of other selves. This assumption is in accordance with the pluralistic hypothesis and is justifiable, for it in no way conflicts with the facts. It cannot be proved by the latter, however, so that it is an assumption; but it must be remem- bered that no philosophy can proceed without it. Solipsism is logically irrefutable, but quite barren. A man who is not a solipsist can prove a solipsist to be wrong to his own satisfaction, for he knows that he exists; but he cannot prove to the solipsist himself that he is wrong. To all such attempts, the latter simply replies that the whole thing is merely part of a particularly vivid dream of his own. On the other hand, solipsism is equally unable to prove its case, so that we are at liberty to assume the existence of other people. This assumption is a most valuable one, for it at once opens to us an immense fresh store of knowl- edge by description, in addition to the knowledge we have through our own immediate sense-experience. VI. Continuity.-Turning to the objective side of experience, we find in what is called the 'continuity' of experience, a source of difficulty which has been keenly realized by philosophers of all periods. The new realists claim to have disposed of the difficulties by means of their new scientific method, but the sort of continuity they are led to, is not the sort of continuity we find in experience, although, for most purposes, it may represent it adequately enough.</page><page sequence="17">No. 3.1 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 243 An examination of the disputes which have always centered round this question of continuity renders it clear that they are almost invariably rooted in the ambiguity of the term. Analysis shows that it is used with two very different meanings. There is first of all what might be called the older, common-sense mean- ing; and then the modern, mathematical use of the term. The first may be best illustrated by considering the conception of a continuous material substance. Such a conception has appeared at various times and in various connections in physical science, as opposed to the atomic view of material substance. A con- tinuous substance is structureless in the sense that it is not built up by the aggregation of a number of small elementary substances. Such a substance, though it seems paradoxical at first sight, would be indivisible; for the separation of an ordinary substance into two parts consists in overcoming the mutual forces between certain of its elementary particles. But in the case of our so- called 'continuous' substance, where there are no elementary particles, a moment's thought suffices to show that the operation of division could not actually be performed at all-all of which simply comes to this, that in such a case, when we say that our substance is continuous, we really mean that it is one-not relatively, but absolutely one and indivisible. In fact, the use of the word 'continuous' in this way is both arbitrary and unnecessary. Such continuity is just unity. Nothing more nor less than this is meant by the continuity of experience. The individual experience is an indivisible unity. The use of all such words as 'interpenetration' is simply the groping after the expression of that one fact-experience is one and indivisible. And, after all, what more do we need? There is no great diffi- culty in the conception of such a unity. It is one, because it is presented to one subject. The introduction of the additional notion of continuity is entirely gratuitous, and at once raises fresh and irrelevant difficulties. Much dispute and confusion would be avoided, if people would stop talking about the con- tinuity of experience, and simply speak of its unity. The modern tendency is rightly to restrict and make definite the use of the word 'continuity,' by employing it with one mean-</page><page sequence="18">244 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. ing only, viz., that of mathematical continuity. In this sense continuity is essentially a property of ordered series. The new realists suppose continuity of this kind to be typical of experience. Mr. Russell,' for example, asserts that the particular degree of continuity known as 'compactness' is sufficient to describe the continuity of experience. A compact series is one in which to any term there is no next term, that is one in which, if any two terms be selected, it is possible to find other terms between them. The number of terms of such a series is, of course, infinite. The view we are considering regards the objective side of experience as a compact series of sense-data. The correctness or falsity of the view just stated hinges entirely upon the fact that a series consists of terms, and that however many terms there are, and of whatever magnitude they may be, they are discrete, each existing per se. Hence, if sense-data form a compact series, we must consider them to consist in an infinite number of separate members, each of indefinitely short duration. So much seems to be admitted by Mr. Russell. Yet again the point is overlooked that sense-data, though absolute and objec- tive for the individual to whom they are presented, are relative and subjective from a universal standpoint. The separation of subject and object is still artificial. All that the theory under consideration has any right to assert is that the introduction of the notion of compact series is one of the most adequate ways of dealing with the unique continuity of experience considered objectively in abstraction. No doubt results based on analysis on these lines will be sensibly accurate when tested by experience; but this simply follows from the fact that the original construc- tions of compact series are sensibly accurate to the same order. It cannot be true, however, that experience is really composed in part of such a series of sense-data, for, as we have seen, the members of a compact series, in spite of their infinitude, are each a definite separate entity. The question might be raised as to whether such a series could have anything but an abstract existence. For example, we may write down any member of the compact series of rational fractions, but it is difficult to see how I Op. cit., Lect. V.</page><page sequence="19">No. 3.1 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 245 the complete series could exist concretely. Apart from this, however, we cannot look upon sense-experience as a compact series, for its continuity really consists in its unity. The totum objectivum of perceptual experience is one and indivisible, for it is presented to one subject. Hence if we analyze the former into a number of separate entities, we imply that the latter is also a series of separate existences. Again the appeal must be to concrete experience. The subject is one, persisting through change. This much we realize, though the notion of separate instantaneous existences may not be a logically impossible one. Moreover, it should be noted that the object of experience is in part determined by the activity of the subject. Again it is difficult to see how this could be so if there were sense-data existing independently as separate entities, and merely passively perceived in appropriate conditions. It would probably be replied that all that can be said is that certain motor sensations are followed by changes in the other sense-data, the motor sen- sations themselves being part of the data. But this assertion ignores the fact that the ground of the motor sensations is the activity of the subject. The source of the whole difficulty, then, lies in the distinction between perceptual experience and its symbolic representation. Individual experience is unique, particular, and incommunicable. In describing it symbolically, therefore, our description cannot be entirely adequate, for it is conceptual, and the conceptual must always contain some element of the general. Hence the essential privacy of concrete individual experience cannot be compre- hended in a descriptive formula. Moreover, in reflecting on experience and its implications, we are bound to attack it piece- meal, and to analyze it by abstraction, on account of our intel- lectual limitations. This inevitably entails a certain artificial immobilizing and dissection of experience, which we effect by means of concepts. Experience is dynamic and continuous, but concepts are static and discrete, even though they be concepts of things which are themselves dynamic. The above point is illustrated particularly clearly by what Mr. Russell calls the logical answer' to the objections raised 1 Op. cit., Lect. V, p. I50.</page><page sequence="20">246 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. against the application of the mathematical theory of continuity to experience. Change, he urges, is a fact. But change involves relations, and relations are fundamental. Thus change demands analysis. Now we may grant that relations are fundamental, but what exactly does this mean? Simply that so soon as we come to analyze experience reflectively in abstraction, we find that we cannot proceed at all without the concept of what we call 'relation,' in addition to the concept of what we call 'thing.' Yet in the actual concrete individual experience there is no question of 'relation' or 'thing.' There is just a presented whole perceived by the subject, a whole which simply exists and is given as a whole. For example, let us try and imagine what may be called an 'instantaneous' section of experience. At any instant we perceive in fact but one object, the presented whole. No spatial series of separate parts (however great in number and however small in magnitude the latter may be) enters into the actual experience itself. The same is the case when we include time within our purview, and consider individual experience as a whole. There is here no temporal series of sense-data. Ex- perience in its actuality is not a series. Considered in its entirety (which is the only adequate way of considering it) it is simply 'subject perceives object.' The object is an individual whole, and therefore, by its very uniqueness, cannot be characterized, as such, by such a general term as relation, for the latter implies the existence of more than one distinct individual. It is only when we come to reflect upon experience that we are bound to consider it piecemeal, and to introduce such general terms as 'parts' and 'relations.' To whatever closeness we may in this way approximate to the actual experience, we can never entirely get rid of that element of the general, which necessarily renders inadequate the conception of what is essentially particular. Mr. Russell makes the further statement,' that the type of objection we have raised against regarding the continuity of experience as being of a mathematical kind is a particular example of a more general doctrine, which, broadly stated, amounts to saying that there can never be two facts concerning the same 1 Op. cit., Lect. V, p. I50.</page><page sequence="21">No. 3.1 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 247 thing. He points out that the latter is evidently untrue. This may certainly be granted in general; but how does it apply to the particular thing we are examining, viz., concrete individual experience? Strictly speaking, there is only one fact about such an experience in its actuality, which fact. may be stated in the proposition 'It exists.' The 'it' of this proposition is the totum objectivum, or presented whole, of individual experience. Its actual nature is only realized fully by the particular perceiving subject. In actual perception, before reflection follows, it is perceived as an indivisible unity. It is often called the 'pres- entational continuum,' but it is more correct to call it the 'presentational unity.' All other propositions asserting facts (so-called) about experience, are simply attempts to express as adequately as possible in conceptual form the nature of private experience. They are inadequate, for the proposition expressing the sole and particular fact of the existence of the perceived object in its peculiar intimacy and uniqueness realizable only by the percipient, is replaced by a number of propositions, ex- pressing our attempts to deal, by general characterizations, with something which is essentially particular. The attempts furnish us, for the most part, with a sufficient approximation, but in dealing with ultimate questions, it is of the first importance to remember that of necessity they are but approximations. It is evident, then, that the results of analysis by the scientific method cannot be fully adequate. This does not detract from the value of the former in practice, so far as it goes, for it is the most adequate conceptual method of dealing with experience. We could have no better conceptual way of representing what is called the 'continuity' of experience than by mathematical continuity. But this representation must not be regarded as a final complete solution, for the reasons we have given. It is necessary and sufficient for purposes of calculation, and for the establishment of the validity of certain physical conceptions, but the final solution of the difficulties which have been raised, lies in realizing that the so-called 'continuity' of experience is actually its unity, being, as it is, the experience of one subject. What exactly is meant by 'one' thing? For example, we talk</page><page sequence="22">248 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. of a chair or a table as being one object; but the physicist regards the chair or the table as made up of a number of other single objects, viz., molecules. The molecules again, are made up of atoms, and so on. It appears that there are two distinct mean- ings to be attached to the word 'one' when applied to things. The first is subjective or teleological, the second objective and absolute.' It is in the former sense that a chair or a table is one object. In other words, we speak of a thing as being one, when it functions as one in relation to our purposes, or to the purposes of other subjects of experience. On the other hand, we can only regard a thing as being one in the absolute sense, when it is a true individual. Where do we find such individuals? Evidently physics does not deal with them. Its molecules and atoms are not unique. Subjects and their experiences are the only true individuals. The self may be considered an absolute unit, for it is unique and indivisible. For this reason alone, pluralism, being expressed in terms of selves, would have an advantage over any description of existence in terms of sense-data, for the latter are, as we have seen, purely artificial units. Finally, it should be pointed out that the consideration of the meaning to be attached to the concept of 'one thing' is in no way connected with the meaning of the number 'one.' VII. Causality.-Among the chief categories which are com- monly regarded as applicable to experience, is the category of causality. This category has been a source of difficulty and confusion owing to the unfortunate vagueness and ambiguity with which the term 'causality' is frequently used, especially in its scientific application. Analysis by the new scientific method has done much to clear up this confusion.2 As a result of this analysis, it is pointed out that with regard to the objective side of experience, we can only say that the sequences observed in it are characterized by sufficient similarity to admit of more or less adequate description in general terms. Hence we can I We might, perhaps, distinguish a third use of the phrase 'one thing,' viz., as applied to a body which moves as a unit. [See Perry's Present Philosophical Tendencies, p. 52]. 2 B. Russell, op. cit., Lect. VIII.</page><page sequence="23">No. 3.] SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 249 enunciate certain propositions in virtue of which the occurrence of some events can be inferred from the occurrence of other events. To these propositions we may give the name of 'causal laws.' Therefore, from the purely scientific point of view, we should go no further than the mere statement that such causal laws do subsist. This is evidently true, for if we take objective expe- rience as it stands, there is simply the fact that certain sense-data are invariably followed by certain other sense-data. The sequence contains in itself neither hint as to the reason for this invariance, nor warrant that it will continue to hold in the future. Scientific observation alone, then, can do nothing more than formulate descriptions of these sequences, together with the statement that it seems probable that they will continue to hold in the future as they have invariably done in the past. From this point of view, any further extension of the principle of caus- ality is both unnecessary and unjustifiable. If the exponents of the scientific method were content to stop at this point all would be well; but they go further, and assert that the meaning of causality considered above is the only valid one. Yet the roots of the concept of causality go far deeper than this. If we trace the development of this concept during the growth of experience, we find that it is inseparably bound up with the notion of efficiency or activity. We ourselves, as active agents, initiate changes in our environment, and we realize our activity to be the ground of which these changes are the con- sequence. Many of the sequences which occur in experience independently of us, we can reproduce at will. Thus we arrive at the conception of efficient causality as distinct from merely descriptive causal laws, ourselves being efficient, and, for the most part, self-determined causes. Inevitably we come instinc- tively to consider efficient causality as the ground of those sequences which we observe in experience. Logically, as we have seen, mere observation only gives us the right to assert that certain sequences do recur, and to state the fact in a general proposition. Seeing, however, that we actually realize self- activity to be the ground of many sequences-sequences which we can always render essentially similar-there is no reason why</page><page sequence="24">250 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. we should not adopt, at any rate hypothetically, the view that all observed sequences have their ground in the activity of ex- periencing subjects. In this way, causality, as applied to per- ceptual experience, comes to have a definite concrete meaning, namely, the efficiency of active individuals. No doubt the con- cept is anthropomorphic, but that simply means that it is based on the nature of the subject, as distinguished from the object, of experience. Hence we realize that efficient causality certainly exists, and we are therefore justified in attempting to' find a satisfactory interpretation of the sequences which occur objec- tively in experience, by the application to them of this concept of efficiency. Activity is fundamental. Everyone realizes what it is to be active. Yet certain modern representatives of the traditional idealist school,' dismiss activity as pure illusion. It is difficult to see what the assertion 'All activity is illusion' can possibly mean, if it mean anything at all. When I think or do, I say that I am active. All that is meant by activity is a living and doing. If the idealist asserts that living and doing are illusions, the reply is simply that the illusion at any rate exists, and therefore it is the illusion itself that we mean by activity, if it be an illusion. There is no meaning at all in the term 'illusion' as applied to direct experience. It is only when wrong judgments are based on experience that illusion can be said to exist. When we talk of being active, it is simply a way of specifying a certain fact. We may draw wrong conclusions from the fact, and in that case 1 E. g., F. H. Bradley in Appearance and Reality. The New Realists also reject activity (cf. R. B. Perry in Present Philosophical Tendencies, pp. 70, 99 and elsewhere). It is stated that all that is perceived is certain muscular sensations, etc., but no 'power.' This is not denied, but the fact (too often overlooked), which lies at the root of the question, is that activity is not an object of perception or knowledge at all. It is not presented to the subject, for it is the subject who is active. But we realize that we are active, although our activity is not presented to us. The realists and others might just as well deny the existence of perception, because we only find certain things given, of which our own 'perceptivity' is not one. We do not perceive our perceptivity-it is not an object of knowledge- but we realize that we perceive things, and the proposition asserting this fact is of course a piece of knowledge (by description, not perception). Hence there is no more ground for denying the existence of activity in general, than for denying the existence of perception, in which the subject is active in a particular way.</page><page sequence="25">No. 3.1 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 251 it is correct to say that we are the victims of illusion. Yet, however that may be, the fact remains. Returning to the new realists, we find then that they deny the validity of the concept of efficient causality. They maintain that the only meaning which causality can have is that which we have seen it possesses in descriptive science, namely, that in objective experience certain essentially similar sequences recur, which fact is expressed in a number of propositions (one for each set of similar sequences) termed 'causal laws.' This they con- sider is all that can be said on the subject. As an example of a causal law the law of gravitation is frequently cited.' The latter contains no reference to 'cause' or 'effect.' The expression of the law as applied to a material system, simply takes the form of certain differential equations. From these it follows that the configuration of the system at any given instant is a function of that instant, and of the configuration at two given instants. This is true enough, but the fact remains that such differential equations, and the function which is their integral, are purely descriptive. They contain no hint as to 'how' and 'wherefore.' They simply tell us what does occur, without suggestions why it occurs. Moreover, there is still the question as to what deter- mines the particular form of the equations from which the con- figuration at any instant can be deduced. It is not determined by logic, for logic and mathematics can give no answer to the question. As already suggested, the ground of the motions of such a system lies in activity. The particular nature of the motion, with its corresponding typical descriptive function, is determined by the particular type of activity of the agents con- cerned. The fact that our differential equations are shown by experience to hold for past and future as well as for present, simply means that the activities of certain individuals are sufficiently habitual to admit almost completely of description in general terms. We have seen that the introduction of the notion of active subjects does more than shift the descriptive formula one step further back, for it provides an explanation as opposed to a mere description. 1 See, e. g., B. Russell, "On the Notion of Cause," Scientia, p. 327. [See p. 239 above, footnote.]</page><page sequence="26">252 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. Mr. Bertrand Russell' gives the following definition in this connection. A system is said to be 'deterministic' when, given certain data, el, e2 . . . en, at times, t4, t2 . . . tn respectively, concerning this system, if Et is the state of the system at any time t, there is a functional relation of the form Et = f (el, ti, e2, X ... , ens tn t). The system will be 'deterministic' throughout a given period "if t, in the above formula, may be any time within that period, though outside that period the formula may be no longer true." Mr. Russell goes on to consider the possibility that such a formula may be applicable to the Universe, in which case the latter would be a deterministic system. Leaving aside for the moment the general question as to whether the Universe is in any sense deterministic or not, and if so in what sense, let us consider what determinism, in the above use of the term, implies. In the first place it is evident that the given functional relation is equivalent to a description in general terms. Now the funda- mental characteristic of the Universe is the particularity of its facts. The individuals which, at least in part, compose it, and their experiences, are essentially unique, and therefore are in no way susceptible to description in general terms. This fact is of the first importance when we are endeavoring to form a final conception of the nature of the Universe and not simply attempt- ing to formulate a partially adequate general description of certain aspects of it. If they are to take account of the unique- ness in the Universe, the data contained in our functional relation would have to comprise every individual in the Universe, and the experience of each at every instant of his history, were this possible in a relation of the given type. It is true that Mr. Russell admits that the relation may be of strictly infinite com- plexity, but if it must necessarily be of the order of complexity we have indicated, it would simply be a recital of the whole history of the Universe. That is, it would have to contain explicitly all the information which it might have been hoped to contain implicitly. There is, in fact, no room in it for a variable at all, for it contains 1 "Notion of Cause," Scientia, pp. 33I ff.</page><page sequence="27">No. 3.1 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 253 all values of such a possible variable in its data. It is therefore clear that not only is such a functional relation as was originally described utterly valueless and incapable of affording any final information about the Universe, but that it cannot in any sense be significantly applied to the Universe at all; for as soon as we attempt thus to apply it, it ceases to be such a relation, losing all meaning with the disappearance of the variables. If, as we have suggested, the Universe is made up of active individuals, the reason for this result is clear; for no individual can be completely described in general terms, seeing that he is -an individual, and consequently his actions cannot be so described. The data e1, e2 . . . en are referred to as 'determinants' of the system, the state of which is defined at any instant by the functional relation given. A 'mechanical' system is then appropriately defined as one having a purely material set of determinants, such as the position at given instants of certain pieces of matter. It is maintained that such a system might equally well be teleological (that is, purposive) or not. But the existence of purposes implies the existence of active individuals such as ourselves. Now we have seen that such a functional relation as defined above cannot exist in any adequate application to a Universe containing unique individual selves. Therefore, if a mechanical system can be described by such a functional relation, as it assuredly can if the terms 'mechanism' and 'matter' have their usual meaning as employed in the physical sciences, it cannot also be a teleological system, namely, one in which actions are purposive. Conversely, for the same reasons, no teleological system can also be mechanical. It is then urged against the notion of efficient causality that the future determines the present to the same extent as does the past; in other words, cause does not 'compel' effect, in some sense in which effect does not compel cause.' But, again, this determination of the present by the future is only logical and descriptive. Even assuming for the moment that certain functional relations actually subsist which are significant as a complete or partial description of such a Universe as ours, there 1 B. Russell, Knowledge of External World, Lect. VIII, p. 220.</page><page sequence="28">254 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. is still a difficulty in the way; for although the formulation of the relations may work either way in time, we cannot ignore the one-directionality of time in concrete experience. The rela- tions, though symbolic of a dynamic process, are themselves static. They simply assert that on given assumptions such as uniformity, there is logical dependence of the present on the future, just as there is logical dependence of the present on the past; but they fail to comprehend concrete experience fully, in that they ignore the actual fact that time progresses in one direction only. Thus, if all that these relations imply were true, there is no reason why the crime should not sometimes follow the punishment which is its due, nor why the determina- tion to build a house should not follow the appearance of that house on the scene. Perhaps the existence of purpose and con- sequent action leading to realization illustrates best of all the hopelessness of the attempt to replace the notion of causal effi- ciency by the notion of mere logical dependence. For there is certainly a sense in which it can be said, for example, that the house was built because Jack determined to build it, in which it cannot be said that Jack determined to build the house because the house was built. Moreover, we are indubitably aware that our actions determine their ends in a sense altogether different from that in which the ends determine the actions. This could not be so if the relation between them were purely logical. The matter may therefore be summed up somewhat as follows: The true meaning which causality has for us is rooted in the realization of our own efficiency, as active individuals. The active individual is the 'cause.' The end which his (generally purposive) activity accomplishes is the 'effect.' The scientific method, however, takes the sequences which occur in experience as they stand and determines what may truly be said of them per se. In the first place, it finds that sequences continually recur sufficiently similar in nature to admit of a considerable degree of general characterization. Secondly, it follows that a general proposition may be affirmed with regard to each recurring sequence, whereby the occurrence of one event may be inferred from the occurrence of another event. Thirdly, there is no</page><page sequence="29">No. 3.1 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 255 guarantee (except the rather doubtful one of probability) that such propositions will continue to hold in the future. Finally, it is seen that we can go no further than this from the objective standpoint of science. It might also be pointed out that, strictly speaking, the term 'causal law' ought not to be applied at all to such propositions as we have been considering. For, in view of the concrete meaning which 'cause' has for us, the word 'causal' implies that the sequences to which the proposi- tions refer, have their ground in the activity of individuals.' The results of this analysis by the scientific method are valuable for the philosopher, for they make clear the exact nature of the assumptions he is making in applying the pluralistic hypothesis to the sequences observed in experience. Still more valuable are they for the physicist, seeing that they warn him from unwarran- table applications of causality, and point out the only valid way, from the scientific (and therefore descriptive) point of view, of looking upon the succession of phenomena with which he deals. There is no doubt that physicists of all times have been strongly influenced by the notion of causality based on subjective activity. One fact alone is sufficient to show this, namely, the curious reluctance which has always been shown to accept the idea of action at a distance. Attempts are invariably made to reduce everything to terms of contact action. The reason is that our own interference with the environment is conditioned by the contact of our bodies with other bodies. Had we been endowed with powers of levitation and removal without contact, the notion of action at a distance would probably have been adopted as a matter of course. Thus far, and in this application, we may recognize the truth and value of the results due to analysis by the scientific method. Pluralism, on the other hand, approaches the question in a dif- ferent way, and with a different purpose in view. It is concerned not simply with the phenomena as such, but with an explanation of them which shall satisfy such beings as we are. On the basis of our own existence as efficient individuals, and of the fact that 1 If this implication is granted, however, the term 'causal law' is of course appropriate.</page><page sequence="30">256 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. sequences observed independently of our activity can often be essentially reproduced by that activity, it proceeds to explain all sequences by the activity of individuals. This, of course, it is required to do if its hypothesis is to hold, and this it is successful in doing while no facts can be brought forward to disprove its case. VIII. Other Categories of Experience.-Although the considera- tion of continuity and causality brings out most clearly, perhaps, the distinction between the aim, method, and scope of pluralism and the new scientific method respectively, incidentally making clear the value to be attached to the criticism of the former by the latter, it is of great importance to examine the other cate- gories of experience if a clear conception is to be framed of the basis on which pluralism rests. The attention may be directed in the first place to the category of Substance and Attribute. A review of the classical attempts to deal with the notion of substance makes it clear that the problem resolves itself into an endeavor to reconcile the principles of permanence and change. Heraclitus, who was the first to bring out more or less plainly the nature of the difficulties involved, held that only change is permanent; but closer examination shows that, with any sig- nificant meaning which can be attached to the term 'change,' the truth of the matter is that change implies permanence. For, in the first place, it is apparent on general grounds that if there is a change, there must be a thing which changes,. the said thing maintaining its identity throughout the change. Other- wise, there is simply one thing and then another thing, that is, mere succession and not change at all, properly so-called. From the scientific standpoint we certainly do consider mere alteration alone, that is, simply a succession of different presentations. But from the subjective point of view, if I have first A and then B before me, I can in no significant sense be said to have appre- hended a process of change; at most there has been a change in myself, and this, since it is I who have perceived both A and B, assumes my permanence. As a matter of fact, we do only per- ceive a process of change, as such, at a high level of experience; yet, when we have reached this level, we feel impelled to look for</page><page sequence="31">No. 3-] SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 257 a permanent basis as a ground of the ceaseless flux of experience, whether it be logically necessary or not. If we analyze the meaning of a process of change from a con- ceptual point of view, it would seem to be somewhat as follows: At a given time certain true propositions may be asserted of a given individual. At another given time, certain other true propositions, wholly or partly incompatible with the former set, may be asserted of the same individual. If we consider the propositions as particular values of certain propositional func- tions, the particular value considered of the argument of these functions remains the same throughout. This is the symbolic counterpart of the fact that the individual considered maintains his identity. Evidently, from this point of view, it would be difficult, and perhaps impossible, to formulate in words the reconciliation of the principles of permanence and change. The reason for this difficulty is that, conceptually, we necessarily consider experience as a time-series. Let us attempt to estimate the true bearing of this. In the first place an analogy may be of use. We do not consider the identity of an individual at any given time to depend upon his position in space. At a given time, I should not be a different person if I were in London and not in Edinburgh. That is, identity is not conditioned by the spatial series.1 Why, then, should it be conditioned by the time-series? It would probably be answered that the nature of the individual is different at dif- ferent instants of the time-series. He develops (or the reverse) in time; and it certainly seems, at any rate prima facie, that time is more closely bound up with existence than space. But what is the time-series referred to? Not the conceptual or universal time-series, for that is a mental construction. The private time- series of the individual concerned, then? But his time-knowl- edge is based on change and the existence of the memory- perspective, which implies maintenance of identity. Hence this line of thought bids fair to end in a vicious circle. The truth is that we can never entirely resolve the difficulty conceptually for reasons we have considered in another connec- 1 I cannot, of course, be in two places at once, but that does not mean that I am what I am because of my position.</page><page sequence="32">258 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. tion, namely, that actual existence is particular and cannot therefore be comprehended in a conceptual formula. The con- ceptual formulation of the facts, if pressed too far, necessarily gives rise to difficulties which do not admit of complete solution. Nevertheless, it is possible to indicate to a considerable extent a method of viewing the facts which brings us as near as possible to a complete comprehension. In the first place, it is necessary to get rid of the time-bound view of experience. Just as in forming as adequate a conception as possible of the object of experience it is necessary to consider it as an indivisible whole in space and time, so also must the individual subject of experience be regarded as a unity in space and time. In other words, we must try to conceive some such world as the space-time universe of Min- kowski. The latter applies his conception to the problems of physical science. In such a universe as he imagines, the entire existence of a physical system is specified by means of three space- and one time-coordinate, and is presented as a whole. In an exactly similar way we must look upon the individual subject as a space-time entity. His existence can only be speci- fied as a whole; it is neither punctual nor instantaneous. From a logical standpoint, the proposition 'He exists' must not be sup- posed to imply any spatial nor temporal reference; that is, there is no real meaning in the notion of existence at a given point or at a given time, though we may adopt the idea conventionally. The point is brought out still more clearly if we consider non- existential propositions which may be asserted of the individual. In examining this point previously, we pointed out that one set of propositions might be true at one time, and another partly or wholly incompatible set at another time. If, however, the propositions are modified by the insertion of date and place, their truth is independent of space and time. The date and place referred to may be considered as uniquely determined. For example, if they be specified by position in conceptual space and time, they will yet be connected by a one-one correlation with the private space and time of each individual. The com- plete specification of an attribute of an individual, or of a relation of which he is one of the terms, must therefore contain a spatial</page><page sequence="33">No. 3.] SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 259 and a temporal reference. Hence there will be a set of proposi- tions concerning the individual which will be true once for all. Regarding the propositions as particular values of certain propo- sitional functions, the particular value of the argument of these functions is the individual considered. Since the propositions, however, are not limited as to their truth-value by space nor time, the particular value of the argument cannot be dependent upon space nor time. Thus the individual is a space-time unity. From this conceptual standpoint, such notions as 'process' and 'development' lose nothing of their meaning nor value, but, like all concepts which refer to matters-of-fact, their inadequacy leads to the difficulties we have been analyzing. Yet although the solution of the problem of identity and change is attended by such difficulty when looked at from an abstract point of view, the concrete solution is more easily realized. The self combines, in a particularly complete way, the principles of identity and change. In spite of change, I realize myself to be the same indi- vidual that I once was. Even if we cannot formulate in words, on account of its uniqueness, the exact nature of this reconcilia- tion of change and permanence in the subject of experience, it is, to say the least, almost as satisfactory to realize its existence. This being so, we are encouraged to apply the pluralistic hypoth- esis by regarding the permanent ground of the changing flux of experience as consisting in individual subjects. Before considering the notion of 'attribute,' it may be of interest to make a short digression at this point, by referring back to Minkowski's conception of a space-time world and its bearing on philosophy. The conception arose in the first instance out of difficulties similar to those we meet with in analyzing change. Recent researches in physical science have brought to the fore, with increasing insistence, the question as to what meaning, if any, is to be attached to such notions as absolute velocity and absolute position. The controversies to which these problems gave rise culminated in the enunciation of the well-known Prin- ciple of Relativity. There are several ways of stating the latter, but each amounts to this: 'Different descriptions of the same system will be given by different observers.' A description</page><page sequence="34">260 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. depends on the motion of the observer relative to the system. There is no criterion which may be applied to a set of descriptions, by means of which a single true description may be determined. All the descriptions are true. The reason is that if we carry our analysis far enough, we are bound to consider the fact as a whole, namely, not only is there an object, but the object is seen by an observer. Consequently each perception is a different fact, and even admitting the object to be the same, for the purposes of argument, the descriptions, though all true, will be different, for each actually involves the observer and the observation as well as the object observed. Hence physics, which purports to describe things independent of any particular perceiving subject, is compelled in the end to take account of that subject. This is inevitable, seeing that the concepts of physics are constructions based in the first place on individual perceptions. In fact, the principle of relativity, as applied to physical science, is a par- ticular example of the more general philosophic fact that while the experience of the subject is objective and absolute for him, it is subjective and relative from the universal conceptual stand- point. In considering existence, then, from the conceptual point of view, we are continually brought face to face with its-relativity. This is the root of the difficulty in the problem of change. As regards physical science, Minkowski succeeded in transcending the difficulty of relativity by introducing this idea of a space- time world. In this way he not only made clear the source of the trouble, but also indicated how it might be eliminated in analysis. It is simply a question of taking a wider view of exis- tence; and in considering an individual who changes and yet maintains his identity, we shall get rid of the difficulties to a great extent if we proceed on similar lines. In specifying an individual, reference must be considered to be made to a space- time unity. In such a proposition as 'A went to London on Saturday,' A must not be supposed to be specified by any time or place. A is a space-time entity whose existence is considered as a whole. The proposition, though it contains a spatial and temporal reference, is asserted of this individual whole, which transcends both space and time.</page><page sequence="35">No. 3.1 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 26i In the existence of the self, then, the principles of permanence and change are reconciled; therefore the self is a concrete actuality corresponding to the concept of substance. A distinction is sometimes made between substances and Substance. The latter is regarded as some unity which is the ground of all existence. With the questions as to whether such a unity exists, and if so, what is its exact nature, we are not here concerned; but enough has been said to indicate that we can only form a satisfactory idea of such an all-pervading substance, by considering it to possess all the general characteristics of a self or subject of ex- perience. Keeping, however, to the selves which we know to exist, and which we have identified with substances, what mean- ing ought we to attach to the term 'attribute' as applied to such individuals? In the first place, the term should be strictly limited. In particular, the fact that A stands in a certain relation to B must not be held to constitute an attribute of A. Proposi- tions assigning attributes to an individual are of the subject- predicate form. For our purposes, such propositions may be regarded as falling into two main types. These types may be illustrated by the two propositions: 'He is just,' and 'He is French.' The first makes a statement about the nature of the individual to whom it refers. The second, as such, asserts nothing directly about the nature of the individual, but is rather a specification of certain relations in which he stands. It should be noted, however, that this proposition may be held to imply a number of other propositions of the first type, namely, those assigning to the individual the characteristics he shares in com- mon with all Frenchmen. The term 'attribute' might well be limited to the predicate of propositions of the first type. A brief consideration suffices to show that such propositions invariably imply something about the mode of activity of the individual concerned. For example 'He is just' really means 'He acts justly.' We base our judg- ments about the individual on observations of his actions. Thus the attributes of the individual are the ways in which he acts. The fundamental proposition about an individual A is 'A exists,' which is equivalent to 'A acts.' A is a unique particular who</page><page sequence="36">262 THE PHILOSOPHICAL RE VIEW. [VOL. XXVII. cannot be further specified symbolically. What we call his attributes consist simply in his mode of activity. Two categories which seem interwoven particularly closely with the fabric of experience are those of Quality and Relation. Quality and attribute are often used as synonymous terms, but to maintain precise definition we may distinguish between them. Just as we have taken the conception of attribute as appropriately applicable to the individual subject of experience, so may we appropriately apply the concept of quality to the object of that experience. For example, the sense-data presented through different organs differ in quality, e. g., sensations of color differ from those of touch. There are also qualitative differences between sense-data presented through the same organ, e. g., red differs from blue. Differences such as those of intensity, for example, are rather quantitative, implying a relation of more or less between the sensations. It is correct to say that Quality and Relation are fundamental in the object of experience, if the exact implication of the state- ment is clearly comprehended. In concrete experience, as such, there is no question of quality or relation. There is simply a given indivisible unity. This unity is particular, and can only be referred to by such words as 'it' or 'this.' Its characteristics cannot be specified conceptually with adequacy. We cannot take a single step in analyzing experience, however, without introducing the concepts of quality and relation. It is this which should be meant by the statement that quality and relation are fundamental. They are fundamental to the extent that we cannot reflect upon experience at all without introducing them; but into the actual experience as such, they do not enter. This is evident when we remember that quality and relation are general conceptions, whereas experience is essentially particular. All we can say is that when attempting to represent experience conceptually (so far as it can be thus represented), by hypothetically considering it to exhibit certain general characteristics,' we find that two of the most indispensable of such characteristics are quality and relation. 1 These are hypothetical in so far as we consider them to be absolutely identical elements in every individual experience.</page><page sequence="37">No. 3.] SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 263 Failure to realize the foregoing has been a fruitful source of objections levelled at the concepts of quality and relation. For example, consider Mr. Bradley's criticism of the concept of relation' on the ground that it implies an indefinite regress, seeing that a relation between terms requires further relations to relate it to its terms, and so on. There would be some point in this criticism if we asserted that the concept of relation adequately represents experience. But, admittedly, such general concep- tions as quality and relation cannot adequately comprehend the essentially particular. All that is claimed is that in representing experience as adequately as possible by general characteristics, the introduction of the conception of objects between which certain relations subsist, is, for the most part, perfectly satisfac- tory for the purpose of calculated prediction and interference in the course of events. No such complication as the introduction of fresh relations between the relation and its terms is needed to carry on the reasoning based on our premises, and this reasoning is justified, so far as it goes, by empirical verification. Thus Mr. Bradley's objection cannot hold good, for we do not suppose our conceptual system of terms and relations to comprehend experience fully, though on the other hand it is sufficiently ade- quate to describe it and to render possible sufficiently accurate prophecy and successful interference in the course of events. Therefore the objection has no significance as applied to percep- tual experience as such, nor can it be urged against our conceptual apparatus; for we construct the latter ourselves, and find it sufficiently competent to perform its task, which is the only significant test. We may conclude the investigation of the categories of ex- perience by examining two of a somewhat different type from those already considered. They are the categories of Means and End, or Purpose. These categories are only significant in application to a universe containing individual subjects of expe- rience. The categories we have been analyzing are applied in the first place to the object of experience, though the origin of the concept of the category is in some cases subjective, but the cate- 1 Vide Appearance and Reality, 2d ed., Ch. III, pp. 30 ff.</page><page sequence="38">264 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. gory of purpose is primarily applicable to the subject of experience, for it is a characterization of activity. It seems probable that all activity is originally purposive, though oft-repeated actions become less and less consciously purposive and more and more reflex and habitual. In the case of those individuals whose nature we realize most clearly, namely, selves at our own level of development, the ground of activity is in most cases evidently purposive, and not purely material in the scientific sense. For in science, 'material' means 'phenomenal,' whereas the ground of our own activity is the very opposite of phenomenal. Cer- tainly phenomena in part determine the purposes which guide the activity, and the latter may itself be limited by material conditions, but the ground of its initiation is subjective or real as opposed to objective or phenomenal. We may, however, attempt to apply the category of purpose to the ground of what we observe in the object of experience. In such observation we at once notice actions which may be regarded as purposive by analogy with our own. In fact all organic life appears to exhibit this purposive character. We might perhaps describe the activity of an organism in terms of molecular action, that is, in terms of the purely objective con- structions of physics, though it is by no means certain that organic activity could even be completely described thus. In any case, the description, if complete, could not be general, for every organism is unique. Each would therefore require a separate description. On the other hand, we may explain the organism by the organized collective activity of individuals, thus changing the terms from purely mental constructions to concrete entities whose nature we can all more or less realize. The fact that organic activity is thus apparently teleological strongly suggests the applicability of the pluralistic hypothesis, at all events to organic matter. We say 'apparently teleological,' for it is not certain that the existence of such teleology can be conclusively proved from a logical point of view. Could it be so proved the fact would be of enormous significance, for pluralism would immediately be verified as regards organic matter, since the existence of purpose implies the existence of experiencing</page><page sequence="39">No. 3.] SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 265 subjects. However that may be, the attempt to describe organic life in purely physical terms invariably leaves an inexplicable residue of spontaneity, whereas its explanation in terms of indi- viduals differing only in degree from ourselves, is enabled to take the latter fully into account. The pluralistic hypothesis is there- fore to that extent justified. Inorganic matter may be treated by a similar, but somewhat modified, theory. It is analogous to organic species which have become stationary at some period of their evolution. It ap- proaches the lower limit of development. It may be regarded as comprising individuals of an extremely low order of mentality, who therefore exhibit the minimum of spontaneity and the maximum of habit in their reactions. They are thus particularly susceptible of an almost complete description in general terms. It may be concluded that wherever the category of end or purpose can be successfully applied, so also may the pluralistic hypothesis be applied to the same extent; for the existence of purpose implies the presence of mind, that is, of subjects of experience. We have seen that pluralism is in this way applicable not only to the ground of what we term the organic activity observed in the object of experience, but also (with certain modifi- cations which yet conform to the necessary conditions required by an explanation in terms of mind) to the ground of inorganic activity. The whole field of experience may therefore be covered by pluralism; though we are here concerned, not with the details of the application of that hypothesis, but only with its basis. IX. Summary and Conclusion.-We may end our examination of the two most important tendencies in the trend of modern philosophic thought, by summarizing the results to which we have been led. In this way, the scope and limitations of each school of thought, and the results which each may hope to obtain, will be set out concisely and in brief compass. The scientific method, as expounded by philosophers of the new realist type, is embodied in an analysis of the object of experience, with a view to ascertaining the form of the facts concerned. With the particular content of any set of facts it is</page><page sequence="40">266 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. the business of one of the particular sciences to deal. Philosophy aims at determining form, without reference to any particular content. This philosophic analysis has an important application in the investigation of those concepts which we ordinarily apply to the object of experience, notably the concepts of physical science. Since all observation, avowedly scientific or otherwise, must start from sense-data, and since all verification of calcula- tion based on such observation must lie in an appeal to sense- data, it follows that if our concepts are valid, they must be capable of being exhibited as logical functions of sense-data. The analy- sis of the concepts, therefore, finally resolves itself into an attempt to build up such constructions of sense-data as may be con- sidered satisfactorily to represent the concepts involved. Hence the method, at any rate in the last stages of its application, is constructive. Nevertheless, its function is evidently to a con- siderable extent critical. Its field of application consists in the whole of the objective side of experience, and we may willingly admit the claim of its exponents, that it is the only method of obtaining accurate objective scientific knowledge, provided it is clearly recognized that it is subject to two limitations springing from a common root. In the first place, all individual experiences are essentially particular, and the assumption that they exhibit certain general characteristics of form must therefore be regarded as an approximation which is only justified by the fact that it works satisfactorily in practice so long as we are not concerned with a final complete adequacy, and by the still more cogent fact that we are bound to it by our intellectual limitations. In the second place, the units with which the scientific method works are sense-data, and the sense-datum is a purely artificial and conventional unit. The object of experience is an indivisible unity, and (whatever convention we may be compelled to adopt for the purposes of calculation) cannot be considered to consist in a series of members termed 'sense-data,' compact or otherwise. Keeping in mind these limitations of the method, its critical and constructive value in its own field is apparent. In any case, however, its results are purely descriptive. Its exponents claim that the determination of such results as their method affords is</page><page sequence="41">No. 3.] SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 267 the only business with which philosophy ought to concern itself.' As the opinion of philosophers of all ages, with very few excep- tions, has differed widely from this, the claim must be regarded as a purely arbitrary one. In making it, its supporters are proposing their own definition of philosophy, a definition which is not accepted by the majority of philosophers. In addition to the critical investigation of the forms of facts, it is the further business of philosophers to provide an hypothesis which may be said to explain those facts to the satisfaction of such beings as ourselves, while remembering that, although no hypothesis can be regarded as infallible, it may be invested with a very high degree of probability, in virtue of its ability to fit the facts already known, and to furnish explanations of those new facts which are constantly forthcoming. In applying the scientific method to the various problems of philosophy, the new realists have little or nothing to say about the subject of experience. Such brief references as are made imply that the subject, if it exists at all, is merely an inference. But, as we saw, doubt of the existence of the subject is without significance; and, moreover, although the existence of the subject may certainly be inferred-immediately inferred, indeed, from every single fact of experience-there is, in addition, the far more important central and unique fact of our experience, namely, the concrete realization of our own existence. There are several important consequences of this ignoration of the subject. In the first place, certain problems are considered to be outside the scope of philosophy. Such, for example, are the problems of ethics. Mr. Russell says: " The difference between a good world and a bad one is a difference in the particular char- acteristics of the particular things that exist in these worlds. It is not a sufficiently abstract difference to come within the province of philosophy."2 Again this limitation of the philoso- pher's task is a purely arbitrary one. The terms 'good' and 'bad' are only significant in a universe containing such individuals as ourselves. In their fundamental application they refer to the acts of an individual considered in relation to other individuals. 1 But see note on p. 236 above. 2 Op. cit., Lect. I, p. 26.</page><page sequence="42">268 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. Judging the individual by his acts, we may conventionally use the terms in reference to the individual himself. Further, we may also apply them to the object of experience considered in relation to the subject, thus introducing the categories of value. The latter, being categories, are necessarily concerned with the form of facts, thus coming within the scope of philosophy even as limited by the new realists. Moreover, even in application to the acts of the individual, the terms 'good' and 'bad' might be taken to refer to the form of the acts. For example, we might define 'good' as the class of all acts which have as their motive the benefit of others. In any case 'good' and 'bad' are general characterizations, and it is the business of philosophy to define their meaning precisely, and to determine their application. The ignoration of the subject also leads to the consequence that the results of the scientific method are purely descriptive and not explanatory. It does not seek the ground of the object of experience. Men have always felt that there must be such a ground, regarding sensations, per se, as flimsy and ever-changing manifestations of a more substantial reality. In dealing with sense experience, we find it easy to distinguish and to compare, and generally to construct a complicated network of terms and relations. The facility with which we perform such conceptual gymnastics tends to make us lose sight of the fact that the object of experience, as given, is an indivisible unity. When we turn to the subject, however, the case is different. We come down to bedrock almost at once. Any attempt to analyze the subject into parts and relations, at once shows the futility of regarding it in any other light than as a single unity. In the case of the individual subject, we are therefore concerned with content rather than with form. We find in it a substantiality which the object of experience seems to lack, for we are ourselves individual subjects of experience. We are thus led, with pluralism, to look for the ground of the object of experience in the activity of individuals differing only in degree from ourselves. Our own existence is for us the central fact of the Universe, and any attempt to limit philosophy to enquiry into matters where the existence of the subject may be safely ignored, on the ground</page><page sequence="43">No. 3.] SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 269 that we must deal only with form and not with content, is both arbitrary and highly unsatisfactory. After all, the facts of the universe are particular, and it surely lies with philosophy to explain those facts so far as it can. Every philosophic theory must necessarily assume certain logical axioms in accordance with which its reasoning is to be carried on. It is one of the principal tasks of modern logic to reduce such axioms to a minimum. Taking these principles of reasoning for granted, the theory will proceed to start from certain definite facts as data. The more incontrovertible and immediate the facts, and the more fully realizable, the more satisfactory is the theory likely to prove. Pluralism starts from the existence of the self. It makes the assumption of the existence of other selves. Thus it is based on the existence of entities at least one example of which we know to exist, and whose nature we actually realize. It is therefore superior at the outset to theories which start from entities such as sense-data that are objective for the individual. For, in the first place, all such objects are purely artificial units, whether they be sense-data, or the constructions of sense-data which constitute the units of the world of physics. On the other hand, a self is a true unit, a true individual. In the second place, we realize what a self is. We perceive a sense- datum, but we cannot realize what it is, in itself. Moreover, there is the further point that selves cannot be resolved into sense-data, whereas it may be possible to explain sense-data in terms of selves. The next step in the development of pluralism is the analysis of the growth of the experience of the individual subject by the genetic method. It is not sufficient to enquire what certain concepts ought to mean, but also what they do actually mean for us, and how they come to acquire that meaning. If we proceed on these lines, particularly with reference to the chief categories of experience, we arrive at results which in each case, while not leading to it as a logical necessity, strongly suggest the pluralistic hypothesis. The part played by the subject in experience is not a purely passive one. We find that we are able to interfere in the course</page><page sequence="44">270 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. of events, and, within limits, to guide the latter to the fulfilment of our ends. The realization of this ability is the basis of the notion we form of efficiency, and in it the root of the concept of causality is grounded. The concrete meaning of causality for us is therefore the efficient determination of one thing by another. This relation of efficient determination is one-directioned; it is not reciprocal. This follows from the fact of the one-direc- tionality of time in actual experience. No doubt if we formulate symbolically this sequence of cause and effect, there is logical dependence of one on the other. Such a logical dependence, however, is descriptive, and does not alter the fact that in actual experience our activity determines its consequences in an entirely different sense from that in which it is determined by them. In the course of his development, man comes to apply this idea of efficient causality to the sequences which he observes in the object of experience. The question then arises as to whether this application is valid. If we take the sequences simply as they stand, it is certainly not valid. We can only say that certain sequences do occur, and that we are able to formulate propositions in virtue of which the occurrence of some events can be inferred from the occurrence of others. From this purely scientific standpoint, causality is merely a logical and descriptive depen- dence of one event upon another. We may, however, wish to go beyond the mere existence of the sequences in an endeavor to find some satisfactory explanation of their existence as sequences. We know that some efficient individuals exist, and we also know that some of the sequences observed are initiated by the activity of these individuals. Hence we take as an hypothesis the propo- sition that all sequences have their ground in the activity of efficient individuals. This hypothesis is not logically proven, but it covers the facts by explaining them in terms of entities whose nature we can realize. It is therefore justifiable. It is necessary for the purposes of reasoning to formulate out ideas in terms of sequences of sense-data. But the artificiality of the latter is brought out by the consideration of the problem of continuity. In fact, the problem itself is due to this artifi-</page><page sequence="45">No. 3.] SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 27I ciality. That fundamental characteristic of the object of expe- rience which is commonly termed 'continuity,' is really unity- unity in space and time. This consideration alone is sufficient to show that any theory which purports to give a final answer to any of the problems of the Universe in terms of such things as sense-data, may be ruled out at once. On the other hand, the unity of the object implies the unity of the subject, for this is its ground. It thus emphasizes the fact that selves are single space- time entities that may be taken as true units in terms of which to express our explanation of the objective facts of existence. This idea of the self as a unity which, in its completeness, transcends space and time, though for most purposes we conceive it as developing in space and time, is the conceptual representa- tion of something realized concretely in actual experience, namely, the persistence of our identity through change and development. This reconciliation in the self of the principles of permanence and change provides us with a concrete example of that which we endeavor to conceive when we talk of 'substances.' It is impossible to formulate the reconciliation adequately in words, but it is there, and we realize its existence and its nature. We cannot rest content with regarding the object of experience as mere change (whatever that may be) based on no elements of permanence, so that we come to look upon experience as inter- action between self and other selves, following the pluralistic hypothesis. Accordingly, the attributes of these selves or sub- stances are their modes of activity. In many cases this activity seems to lack spontaneity and to conform more or less completely to general laws, being due, as we suppose, to selves of extremely inferior mentality, and so, for the most part, the slaves of habit in their reactions. In many other cases the activity is only completely explicable with refer- ence to the end which it achieves. Possibly we might be able to describe the activity completely in terms of the ordinary objective conceptions of physical science. This alone, however, leaves us far from satisfied. We can no more be content with it than we could be content with a mere description of the acts of other people accompanied by no statement nor understanding of their</page><page sequence="46">272 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. reasons for those acts. But if we regard all activity- as being due to purposive individuals, we not only observe and describe the activity but we understand it. It acquires meaning, where before it was meaningless. The new scientific method is, then, in its own field and for its own purposes, a most powerful weapon of research. For the ends it has in view, the ignoration of the subject of experience is justifiable; but this only so long as we remember that the results obtained must not be regarded as giving a fully adequate account of things, even on the objective side of experience alone, but simply an account, which, in its proper application, is the most satisfactory that can be obtained, owing to the limitations of the conceptual standpoint. The ignoration of the subject has, however, the important consequence that the results obtained by the scientific method may not validly be used to criticize such an hypothesis as pluralism, for they stand on an altogether different ground. On the one hand we are investigating the logical form of facts, on the other we are out to explain the facts, and unless in doing so we describe the facts wrongly, we cannot lay ourselves open to criticism of the kind indicated. The type of result afforded by the scientific method leaves most of us unsatisfied. We wish to go further than mere descrip- tion. The pluralistic hypothesis is an endeavor to satisfy this wish. It attempts to put everything in terms of things whose nature we actually realize, and which may therefore be simply indicated without the necessity of formal conceptual specification. This is all the more important because such a specification can never adequately comprehend the object to which it refers. Pluralism is, of course, an hypothesis, and therefore subject to the limitations of hypothesis in general, but it is based on no assumptions save in so far as it makes use of the logical canons of reasoning, if those can be called 'assumptions.' The asser- tion of the existence of the self is not an assumption; and although we have referred to the assertion of the existence of other people as being an assumption, it is not so, strictly speaking, but rather the first step in the application of the pluralistic hypothesis to the explanation of the facts of experience.</page><page sequence="47">No. 3.1 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY. 273 So far as we are able to explain the facts by it, pluralism is therefore an eminently satisfactory hypothesis; for, while it avoids the introduction of unknowns, it brings home to us the nature of existence in general in an entirely unique way. We have the assurance that where it is successfully applied, the result will be, not merely to shift the problem back a step, thereby creating a new problem of the same type, but to provide a final explanation-an explanation which is capable of fully satisfying such beings as ourselves, in the search for the true nature and meaning of reality.
