<plain_text><page sequence="1">Worlds Without Us: Some Types of Disanthropy Greg Garrard Man is a mistake, he must go. (D.H. Lawrence 1989:188) Modernist Disanthropy It was Friedrich Nietzsche's idea of a good joke to have the end of moral dualism, and of the human alienation from the earth that fol lowed from it, announced by Zarathustra, the very prophet who probably invented it: "I beseech you my brothers, remain faithful to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! ... Despisers of life are they, decaying and poisoned themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so let them go" (1982:125). Sadly, either no one found it funny or it merely went unnoticed, forcing Nietzsche to clear the matter up, with injured irritation, in his megalomaniac self-commentary Ecce Homo: I have not been asked, as I should have been asked, what the name of Zarathustra means in my mouth, the mouth of the first immoralist: for what constitutes the tremendous historical uniqueness of that Persian is just the opposite of this.... Zarathustra created this most calamitous error, morality; consequently, he must also be the first to recognize it. (1989: 327-328). Zarathustra may also have invented the end of the world, an idea that has haunted the Western imagination—especially its environmental imagina tion—since the enthusiastic adoption of the idea by several belligerent Jewish sects around two millennia ago (see Garrard 2011: 93-116). Yet the apocalypse, for Nietzsche as much as for the Judeo-Christian and other apocalyptic traditions, always involves the survival of at least one privileged or unfortunate human: Calvinists hope to be one of the "elect," Zarathustra promises (or threatens) that "Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman—a rope over an abyss" (126), and novels are populated by the likes of Mary Shelley's Lionel Verney, Russell Hoban's Riddley Walker and Margaret Atwood's Snowman. Even in the secular apocalypse, the survivor bears witness to the aftermath of a cataclysm that can hardly be read as anything but a judgment upon humanity In the early twentieth century, though, for the first time writers began to imagine a world completely and finally without people.1 D.H Lawrence, 40 © Board of Regents, University of Wisconsin System, 2012 SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. 1, 2012</page><page sequence="2">Worlds without Us 41 enthused and infuriated by Nietzsche,2 entrusted to his alter ego Birkin in Women in Love a desire that I will call "disanthropy":3 "So you'd like everybody in the world destroyed?" said Ursula. "I should indeed." "And the world empty of people?" "Yes, truly. You yourself, don't you find it a beautiful clean thought, a world empty of people, just uninterrupted grass, and a hare sitting up?" The pleasant sincerity of his voice made Ursula pause to consider her own proposition. And really it was attractive: a clean, lovely, humanless world. It was the really desirable.—Her heart hesitated, and exulted.— But still, she was dissatisfied with him. (1989:187-188) Birkin's disanthropy is inspired, in part, by ordinary misanthropic hatred of "the crowd," but is distinguished by his absence from the future he envisages; man's loss is a gain for "the grass, and hares and adders, and the unseen hosts" (188). Ursula, more realistic, knows better: "'But man will never be gone,' she said, with insidious, diabolical knowledge of the horrors of persistence. 'The world will go with him'" (188). Yet she is not in the least perturbed by Birkin's vision of human absence itself; rather she resents how she is positioned by it as the abstract subject he would redeem with his "Salvator Mundi touch," which she calls "a very insidious form of prostitution" (189). Could disanthropy really be "attractive" and compassionate like this, albeit that we remain conscious of the "horrors of persistence"? Lawrence may have yearned for a world without people, but it was Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse that first explored disanthropy as a formal problem. Twenty years after first reading it, I can still recall the shocking thrill of its central section, "Time Passes," in which the deaths of Mrs Ramsay and two of her children are mentioned parenthetically amid the passing of years through the uninhabited house. We are permitted the merest glimpse of the world without us, which shares more than just a lone, upright hare with Birkin's dream: "It seemed now as if, touched by human penitence and all its toil, divine goodness had parted the curtain and displayed behind it, single, distinct, the hare erect; the wave falling; the boat rocking, which, did we deserve them, should be ours always" (Woolf, 1992:174). There is, again, a peculiar beauty in the disanthropic moment. Of course, people are only temporarily absent—decentred from the narrative locus by war, rumbling just over the horizon—and by no means irredeemably banished. Even so, "Time Passes" is unprecedented in placing the house at the disposal of deep time and its slow, inexorably invasive biological powers: "Once only a board sprang on the landing; once in the middle of the night with a roar, with a rupture, as after cen turies of quiescence, a rock rends itself from the mountain and hurtles crashing into the valley, one fold of the shawl loosened and swung to and fro" (177). The narration anticipates the revelations of biological process SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. 1, 2012</page><page sequence="3">42 Greg Garrard that time-lapse photography will one day make possible, as the lighthouse marks time mechanically upon its walls and Mrs McNab retires defeated: What power could now prevent the fertility, the insensibility of nature? Mrs McNab's dream of a lady, of a plate of milk soup? It had wavered over the walls like a spot of sunlight and vanished ... The place was gone to rack and ruin. Only the lighthouse beam entered the rooms for a moment, sent its sudden stare over bed and wall in the darkness of winter, looked with equanimity at the thistle and the swallow, the rat and the straw. ... Let the swallow build in the drawing-room, and the thistle thrust aside the tiles, and the butterfly sun itself on the faded chintz of the armchairs. (188) Whereas Lawrence's disanthropy is total and terminal, reflecting a crush ing moral verdict upon humanity, Woolf's is formal and tactical:4 Mrs McNab returns with reinforcements, the narrator relinquishes the elliptical temporality of "Times Passes," and the house is recaptured by humanity to become the scene of Lily Briscoe's redeeming vision. Nevertheless, we have now, for the first time, glimpsed the world as it is when we are not looking, and found it at once alluring and frighteningly indifferent. The Future of Longue Durée The origins of contemporary disanthropy appear to lie in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, in two utterly antipathetic developments: the resurgence of millennial Christianity in the United States, and the discovery of geological and evolutionary "deep time." The first further elaborated Christian apocalypticism—already a mar velously baroque construct—with the idea of the Rapture, according to which "the saved" would literally, as the Bible said, "meet the Lord in the air" (Thess. 4:17). Popularized first by John Nelson Darby and Edward Irving in the 1820s, the Rapture was given renewed impetus by Hal Lindsey and Carole C. Carlson's Late Great Planet Earth (1970) and then the phenomenally popular Left Behind series of books and films from the mid-1990s onwards. Despite the extravagant violence to which the Chris tian millennial imagination subjects the "lost" and the borderline cases, the Rapture itself is an instant of clarifying physical transcendence—a trope to which we will return below. Deep time, on the other hand, was proposed by James Hutton in the 1780s and firmly established in Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology (1830-33), which argued that "the vast age of our earth provides ample time to render all observed results [of geology], however spectacular, by the simple summing of small changes over im mense periods" (Gould 2007:158).5 The same incremental changes will obtain in the future, of course, providing natural processes with eons in which to undo what humans have done to and with the Earth. Enabling as it undoubtedly is to geology and evolutionary biology, however, the SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. 1, 2012</page><page sequence="4">Worlds without Us 43 perspective of deep time is necessarily ambivalent within ecocritical analysis, as Rajender Kaur explains: By foregrounding the unimaginably vast vistas of the earth's history, both in terms of time and space, "deep time" provides a salutary distanc ing perspective on contemporary political conflicts and hostilities. But on the other hand, "deep time," with its metaphorical opacity, can also prove to be ... yet another totalizing master narrative that suppresses material histories of oppression wreaked by colonialism in favor of the "long view" that emphasizes human folly. It has the effect of humbling human aspirations, including resistance against exploitation. (2007:126) If disanthropy in its strongest form were the mirror image of deep time—a futurity of longue durée—we would expect similar strictures to apply to it. There is an analogy in the place of "place" in ecocriticism. To put it crudely, ecocriticism started out with a centripetal bias: it was interested in representations of bioregion and locale, pedagogically orientated to wards the idea of reinhabitation, and enthusiastic about a radicalization of pastoral. While centripetal ecocriticism remains influential, equally significant today is the nature-skeptical, centrifugal tendency represented by Ursula Heise's "eco-cosmopolitanism" (2008: 50-62 passim), Catriona Sandilands' "queer ecology" (2004) and the vibrant intersection of ecocriti cism and postcolonial studies (DeLoughrey and Handley).6 So ecocriti cism is becoming less interested in promoting a poetic sense of place and more concerned to foster, in Heise's words, "a sense of planet—a sense of how political, economic, technological, social, cultural, and ecological networks shape daily routines" (55). In other words, daunting though it is, ecocriticism hopes to become an ethics of planetary representation, with both geographical and temporal axes. Evoking the awesome scale of the Earth, to say nothing of its eco logical complexity, is no easy task; as Heise shows, allegory is a "mode that is hard to avoid in representations of the whole planet" (21) given the formidable formal challenges involved. What is true of such geographical scale is, mutatis mutandis, true of the inhumanly deep temporality towards which disanthropy gestures, yet the figure it most frequently deploys is not allegory but synecdoche: the hare calmly sitting up, the room swept by the impassive lighthouse and the pantry repossessed by a thistle stand in for ecological and geological timescales that defy human imagination. Paradoxically, the disanthropic imagination is often momentary or mi crocosmic. It has also, despite its modernist antecedents, hardly any further outgrowths in literary fiction.7 The helpless allegiance of written genres to narrative voice and anthropomorphic characterization makes disanthropic literature conspicuously self-contradictory, and probably impossible. In film, though, the ostensible impersonality of the camera—its mechanical SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. 1, 2012</page><page sequence="5">44 Greg Garrard indifference, even—makes it possible to bracket out both humans as ob jects and, to some degree, the human subject in its most obtrusive forms. Alongside the varied disanthropies of Michael Snow, Werner Herzog, Claude Nuridsany and Marie Pérennou, however, other possibilities of formal (usually partial or strictly provisional) impersonality emerge: Alan Weisman's panoply of scientific expertise in The World Without Us; Lee Edelman's austerely anarchic version of queer theory in No Future; and even the computerized animation of anthropomorphic robots in Disney's Wall'E. Of course, even when, as in Snow's La Region Centrale, the human subject is most rigorously excluded from the artifact, it is presupposed by it too, so a question that will re-emerge repeatedly is: who is the subject "hailed" by this disanthropic artifact? Or to put it another way: assuming I do want to watch my own funeral (and that of all humanity), what is assumed about that "I" and that desire? One immediate answer, rightly suggested by the proximity of dis anthropy to common-or-garden apocalyptic misanthropy, is that it is a cruel, defensive response to the fundamental challenge ecological crisis poses to our sense of reality, as Timothy Morton argues: Imagine the air we breathe becoming unbreathable. There will be no more environmental poetry because we will all be dead. Some ecologi cal language appears to delight in this, even sadistically, by imagining what the world would be like without us. Some deep ecological writ ing anticipates a day when humans are obliterated like a toxic virus or vermin. ... It's hard to be here right now. There is some relief in picturing ourselves dead. I find this more than disturbing. Awareness of the mesh doesn't bring out the best in people. (31) It is true that disanthropy hesitates between being totally unimaginable, and too easily and glibly conceivable. In the former category, take Slavoj Zizek's bizarre assertion that The lesson to be fully endorsed is that of an environmental scientist who concluded that while we cannot be sure what the ultimate result of humanity's interventions into the geosphere will be, one thing is sure: if humanity were to abruptly cease its immense industrial activity and let nature on Earth take its balanced course, the result would be a total breakdown. (2008: 56) While Zizek describes the outcome as "an imaginable catastrophe,"8 he scrupulously avoids imagining, representing or even citing a source for his description of it. He dismisses environmentalism as a bourgeois theologico-political movement just insofar as he sees the scientific claims that underpin it as ideologically motivated. At the opposite extreme is the fatalism epitomized by John Gray's Straw Dogs, a strident polemical assault on anthropocentric delusions: SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. 1, 2012</page><page sequence="6">Worlds without Us 45 Homo rapiens [sic] is only one of very many species, and not obviously worth preserving. Later or sooner, it will become extinct. When it is gone the Earth will recover.... The Earth will forget mankind. The play of life will go on. (2002: 151) Drawing upon Gaia, James Lovelock's metaphor for his hypothesis that the whole Earth is a self-regulating, organism-like system, as well as Thomas Malthus's gloomy prognostications about the limits to population growth, Gray predicts that "Either the Earth's self-regulating mechanisms will make the planet less habitable for humans or the side effects of their own activities will cut short the current growth in their numbers" (8). Bracing though this critique of human arrogance often is, it betrays its glib authority in its use of the third person to talk about the extermination of mankind ("it will become extinct," etc.), a calculated callousness that is, as Clive Hamilton points out, its own sort of evasion: Closely related to the Rapture is another sort of defence favoured by some who would be aghast at ever being mentioned in the same breath. It involves a sort of intellectual distancing through characterising global warming and its impact on the world as "natural" within a larger frame that views humans as just another form of life. This intellectualisation is the preferred coping mechanism adopted by James Lovelock, who argues that Gaia, like the God of Rapture, is indifferent to the fate of humans who are, after all, only one species among many. The fact that the elimination of that species would involve death and suffering on a scale unparalleled is abstracted from by a process of mental withdrawal to a vantage point somewhere in outer space or lodged in universal time from which the cries of the dying cannot be heard. (128) Disanthropy, then, might be, in Teresa Brennan's brilliant phrase, "sado dispassionate" (cited Curry 2006:97) as well as politically disabling. De fined strictly (or even just consistently) it might suffer formal constraints too severe to exist as a meaningful category of cultural criticism.9 Yet it will lead us ultimately to an unspeakable question for ecocriticism. "Oh, do not ask, 'What is it?' Let us go and make our visit.'" The Ecstatic Center: Michael Snow's La Region Centrale "Just think of that... that there is nobody there" (Michael Snow interview, quoted in Michelson 1979:120) The most rigorous attempt at formal disanthropy is La Région Centrale (1971), a brutally minimalistic documentary of the landscape of northern Quebec. Michael Snow picked a location over a hundred miles from hu man habitation and accessible only by helicopter, and then ingeniously ensured that every trace of human subjectivity would also be expunged from the production of the film: he commissioned a camera mount, con trolled by electronic instructions on magnetic tape, that would allow focus SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. 1, 2012</page><page sequence="7">46 Greg Garrard pulling and movement in every direction and plane except that which would point the camera at the apparatus itself. Ten hours of footage were edited into a wildly disorientating 180 minute film of rocks, sky and water, partially synchronized to a soundtrack consisting only of control signals - whirring and bleeps to you and me. In place of any emotional investment in action or character, La Région Centrale forces the spectator to identify with what Snow called "the ecstatic centre," the filming machine itself: never seen completely but glimpsed as a gyrating shadow on the ground; heard in the electronic bleeps that motivate it; and recalled in the celluloid flicker of the X-shaped reel markers that periodically reorientate the viewer. Deprived almost completely of effective or affective reference points, the viewer experiences what Annette Michelson describes as a hyperbolic visuality, violently exaggerating the usual role of the camera as the unperceived locus of a disembodied gaze: "The camera of La Région Centrale, instructed and controlled by the machine, turns in a wild and isolated Canadian landscape in a series of circular variations whose mul tiplicity—of speed, direction, focus—is the function of a 'liberated' eye" (120). The film is akin at once to a nauseating fairground ride and uncut footage from a lunar lander, but it is, at least in principle, fascinating; as Michael Anderson argues: La Région Centrale further makes us aware of our place on this planet, the workings of gravity and its stipulated absence, and finally this planet's revolving trajectory through the heavens. Snow's masterpiece is not only reflexive, it's cosmological. There is, in other words, an excess of ambition here. The impassivity of Snow's film hails the viewer as a coolly intrigued explorer of a radically alienated Earth: "In La Région Centrale there is no attempt to conquer or to anthropomorphize nature," observes Regina Cornwell. "Man and nature are separate, and Snow's use of his specially devised camera supports that separation" (4). The scrupulously disanthropic production comes at a high price. In the first hour, the camera's traverses reveal moments of severe beauty that recall Woolf's "wave falling" and Lawrence's "uninterrupted grass," and even in the second hour, when night draws in and nothing but a tiny moon oscillates across the screen, the increasingly weary and bored viewer might still enjoy a subtle "ambient" sense of the unseen tundra around. The third hour, though, degenerates into a sort of sadism, subjecting the audience to increasingly rapid, sickening and abstract movements and a stream of electronic noise that seems interminable. Malcolm Turvey's term, "machinic narcissism," is an apt name for such terminal robotic self-reference—although Turvey himself intends approbation. The film's title appears at once powerfully decentring and vacuously deictic, since SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. 1, 2012</page><page sequence="8">Worlds without Us 47 Snow's disanthropy renders the location largely irrelevant. La Région Centrale despises the viewer's corporeality even as it invites him into its technologically produced "ecstatic centre." The "cosmological awareness" of the film—its cognitive attitude—provocatively refuses any sentimental ization or aestheticization of landscape, but fails to yield any cognitive or ethical content in their place. Interstitial Disanthropy: Werner Herzog's "Obdurate Universe" Environmentalists have long been accused of hating humanity. At least as far back as eco-anarchist Murray Bookchin's prolonged and tetchy argument with deep ecology love of the biosphere has easily aligned with contempt for its most precocious mammal. Christopher Manes will prob ably never be cited for anything more often than his comment, under the cover of the pseudonym (barely worthy of one of Bart Simpson's prank calls to Mo's Diner) Miss Ann Thropy, that "the possible benefits of [AIDS] to the environment are staggering" (1987:32). Even today, the right-wing blogosphere cites and recites the epidemiological metaphors beloved of Earth First! in its early years to discredit environmentalism—its talk of the "human pox" and the like. On the other hand, decentring humanity need not involve recen tring on the biosphere, as Werner Herzog's 1969 Fata Morgana illustrates. Early on in "Part One: Creation," sustained scenes are emptied of human presence and agency, and yet stained by its incomprehensible traces: the skeleton of an incomplete factory marooned in the desert; military aircraft and guns scattered across a barren landscape; the leathery skins and hollow eyes of dead cattle rotting by a dry watering hole. The "fata morgana" or mirages of the title are machines that flicker in the liquid distance: in one, a car seems to drive in circles, while in another people queue for a bus that moves randomly to and fro. Even the aircraft that land repetitively in the opening sequence seem to recede behind a heat haze partly of their own making. The tribulations Herzog endured in making the film ironically emphasize how it abstracts from concrete geopolitical and ecological horror to the existentialist absurd: in the DVD commentary the coup in Cameroon and the drought in Niger provide context that the film itself nihilistically refuses to yield. Repetition is the gesture de rigueur of the existentialist narrative— Salamano's dog, the continual absence of Godot—and Herzog uses the technique to evacuate actions of their human significance. Prolonged pans of Saharan landscapes and shots from car windows are cut together with scenes that willfully baffle communication: an unspeaking child holds a desert fox by the neck, as if awaiting cinematic direction but receiving none; a pimp and his madam bash away meaninglessly on a piano and SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. 1, 2012</page><page sequence="9">48 Greg Garrard a set of drums. The camera's gaze contrives a film school inhumanity that towards the end descends into such shallow and routine scenes of absurdity as a pockmarked sandy field in which elderly tourists jump up and down looking "crazy." Tedious as it eventually becomes, the chilling contrast between a dignified and sonorous reading of the Mayan creation myth and the seemingly lifeless Sahara and Sahel ensures that the early scenes of Fata Morgana remain a signal instance of existentialist disanthropy, which refuses its landscapes either a human or a biological meaning, and then takes perverse pleasure in finding them meaningless. Fata Morgana is only the most striking example of a preoccupation in Herzog's work with disanthropic moments: the famously prolonged shot of a roiling river in Aguirre: Wrath of God; the luminous cathedral of monstrous horror "beneath a frozen sky" in Encounters at the End of the World; and the wind-thrashed grasses of Timothy Treadwell's continuity shots in Grizzly Man, of which Herzog says: In his action movie mode, Treadwell probably did not realize that seem ingly empty moments had a strange, secret beauty. Sometimes images themselves develop their own life, their own mysterious stardom. Herzog hails the spectator as one annoyingly prone (like Treadwell) to sentimentalize nature, whose anthropocentric illusions have perpetually to be undermined. At the same time, though, he too is vulnerable to the "stardom" of the disanthropic image, as Brad Prager points out: Herzog would never presume to present a false reconciliation between man and nature, nor does he hold the desolate and lonely landscapes in his films in contempt. ... It is not that we opt for being, by virtue of the fact that we exist, but rather that the coldness and cruelty of nature help us recall that we are marooned in an obdurate universe—[Yet] Herzog seems to encourage us to see beauty in his indifferent landscapes. ... He is simultaneously drawn to the beauty of the landscape and drawn to undermine it. (13) Nevertheless, the supposedly unillusioned perspective of the existentialist is prone to its own distortions, some of them unintentionally comic, such as Herzog's determination in Encounters to question a baffled penguin expert whether they ever go "insane," or his comment upon the rainforest in The Burden of Dreams: "The trees here are in misery and the birds are in misery. I don't think they sing, they just screech in pain." As Morton mordantly observes of Grizzly Man: A fate worse than being eaten by wild bears in Alaska could well be Herzog making a documentary about you. Herzog's view of animal indifference and cruelty is as mistaken as Treadwell's view of animal sympathy. We're supposed to judge Treadwell from the cold distance of Herzog's bleak existential gaze—to regard Treadwell like hungry bears. (75) SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. 1, 2012</page><page sequence="10">Worlds without Us 49 Herzog's love of formal, cinematic disanthropy, then, ultimately collapses into ordinary apocalypticism and ethical misanthropy, which coexists eas ily with a dismissal of those whom he calls, in Encounters, "tree-huggers and whale-huggers in their weirdness." When human astronauts return to Earth after 820 years in space in The Wild Blue Yonder, we are told that there were "no more airfields, no towns, no bridges, no dams, no money, no banks, no time and no breath. It had returned to its pristine beauty. It was prehistoric again." Yet the total, mysterious and—from where we sit—painless destruction, evacuation or Rapture of all humanity seems as facile as the footage of misty Venezuelan plateaus Herzog borrows to show us "what it looks like." Disanthropy should be harder than that. "Le Quotidien Des Insectes": Microcosmos As well as excluding mere misanthropy—existential or otherwise— the analysis of disanthropy needs also to distinguish carefully between it and the prevalent forms of documentary representation of animals, from which, too, humans are commonly excluded or peripheral. Rather than attempt this categorically—so to speak, taxonomically—it would be better to explore a boundary case: a wildlife film in which animals are central, obviously, but also in which it makes sense to take the measure of the force with which people have been displaced. Wildlife documentaries in general appear formally disanthropic, but weakly so since the narrating voice easily establishes human priority and presence. However Microcosmos, subtitled People of the Grass, carefully extends the anti-anthropocentrism typical of the genre, while withdrawing from its didactic, natural history ambitions. Primarily, it restricts the verbal commentary to a few sentences of framing narrative at the beginning and the end, which establish the (originally modernist) temporal conceit of the film: that it is a day and a night in the life of a meadow "somewhere in the world." Moreover, by focusing on insects, the least promising subjects for anthropomorphic interest and sentimental engagement, the film conspicuously works to suspend, delay or problematize our habitual forms of identification with the animal other. There is, first, a double dislocation of time and space: like nearly all films, Microcosmos is massively elliptical, editing two years of filming into 75 minutes, and several locations around Perpignan into a single meadow; but then it offers a breathtaking expansion of temporal and spatial co ordinates too, implying the coextensivity of the compressed span of the film and the literal ephemerality of some insect lives, and underlining in visually dramatic form the implications of their minute scale. In one marvelous scene, for instance, a rainstorm drops great, smashing gobs of water that knock insects off their feet and appear to pound ants to death SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. 1, 2012</page><page sequence="11">50 Greg Garrard or unconsciousness. In place of verbal commentary, the soundtrack en twines emotionally-expressive incidental music and a haunting refrain sung by children's voices with real recordings of insects that seem—and are meant to seem—unearthly and incredible: the tramping of ants' feet; the squeaking of pondskaters on the water's surface tension. The productive ambivalence of Microcosmos lies in its determina tion at once to provoke human interest—precisely where it would least be expected—and prevent the obvious kinds of emotional engagement: there is virtually no prédation in the film, for instance, and little mating; rather the insects' cleaning, sleeping, meeting and resting activities pro duce an endearing sense of the everyday. As one of the directors says, "C'est un film sur le quotidien des insectes."10 Other scenes encourage identifications, even anthropomorphic ones, exaggerated by sentimental izing music, as when the hermaphroditic mating of two snails is played as a climactic Hollywood screen kiss, complete with a swelling romantic aria. Even this, though, takes its place within a larger schema of analogies that are markedly disanthropic: a group of ants drinking from a water droplet resembles cattle at a watering hole, and a mosquito emerging from its pupal carapace is made to recall the miraculous emergence of a strange "golden deity," in the words of Claude Nuridsany. He says they aimed for an effect at once "very real" and a kind of "wild mythology." A somewhat similar paradox is evident in their insistence that the purpose of the unique specialized camera rig and elaborate indoor "stage" on which the insects "performed" was designed to elicit natural behaviors they, as entomologists, had seen in the field and wanted to share more widely. The disanthropic refusal of commentary might easily have turned Microcosmos into a triumph of pure spectacle, requiring either a wealth of prior entomological knowledge or a great deal of —probably anthro pomorphic—inference on the part of the audience. In reality, though, the silence in which, as we are told at the outset, we can hear the voices of the insects themselves feels like tremendous delicacy and restraint, which successfully combines the scientists' intense scrutiny and reliance on observational prosthesis with unaffected wonder and delight. The World Without Us—in Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) The most impressive and thorough example of disanthropic repre sentation, and the proximate inspiration for my research, is Alan Weis man's popular science bestseller, The World Without Us. Its extraordinary array of information from a range of scientific and technological disci plines—from climatology and evolutionary biology to materials science, demography, radioecology and bacteriology—is marshaled in the service of a single conceit: SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. 1, 2012</page><page sequence="12">Worlds without Us 51 ...picture a world from which we all suddenly vanished. Tomorrow. Unlikely perhaps, but for the sake of argument, not impossible. Say a Homo sapiens-specific virus—natural or diabolically nano-engineered— picks us off but leaves everything else intact. Or some misanthropic evil wizard somehow targets that unique 3.9 percent of DNA that makes us human beings and not chimpanzees, or perfects a way to sterilize our sperm. Or say that Jesus ... or space aliens rapture us away, either to our heavenly glory or to a zoo somewhere across the galaxy. (2008: 4) At once blindingly obvious and brilliantly original, Weisman's maneuver liberates him to narrate the reclamation of cities by nature, the lingering of toxins in ecosystems and the annihilation of cultural memory While Woolf highlighted our transience by contrast with the eons of evolutionary time, Weisman speculates as to the reverberations of our translocations and extinctions far into the future—the "horrors of persistence" even in a disanthropic world. In places carved out of the trampled hinterland of humanity by war and disaster, like the Korean DMZ or Chernobyl, Weisman vividly illus trates the ancient observation sic transit gloria mundi with the collapsing residues of civilization. In Varosha, a Cypriot resort abandoned during the civil war: The honeycombed facades of empty hotels, 10 stories of shattered sliding glass doors opening to seaview balconies now exposed to the elements, had become giant pigeon roosts. ... Carob rats nested in hotel rooms, living off Yaffa oranges and lemons from former citrus groves that had been absorbed into Varosha's landscaping. The bell towers of Greek churches were spattered with the blood and feces of hanging bats. (95) The astonishing rapidity of the process—nicely troped as "reclamation" of its "birthright" in a space disputed in just those terms by humans—is juxtaposed with the appalling scale of some of our quotidian impacts, such as the "Great Pacific Garbage Patch" that gathers 3 million tons of plastic waste in a slow oceanic gyre. Monstrous in its vastness and persis tence, the sump discovered by Captain Charles Moore in 1997 is narrated as Gothic horror, reminiscent of Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner: For a week, Moore and his crew found themselves crossing a sea the size of a small continent, covered with floating refuse. It was not unlike an Arctic vessel pushing through chunks of brash ice, except what was bobbing around them was a fright of cups, bottle caps, tangles of fishing netting and monofilament line, bits of polystyrene packaging, six-pack rings, spent balloons, filmy scraps of sandwich wrap, and limp plastic bags that defied counting. (121) The counterpoint, for Weisman, in the drama of nature's revenge and mankind's hideous persistence is the pastoral idyll of the world before us, an "Eden" that can still be glimpsed in wildernesses such as the Bialow SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. 1, 2012</page><page sequence="13">52 Greg Garrard ieza Puszcza in Poland to which our animal pulse (or is it our biophilic brain?) helplessly thrills: "... what's astonishing is how primally familiar it feels. And, on some cellular level, how complete" (12). The question explored both widely and deeply, is whether this idyll could ever be re stored: "Could nature obliterate all our traces? How would it undo our monumental cities and public works, and reduce our myriad plastics and toxic synthetics back to benign, basic elements?" (4) The productive ambivalence of Weisman's account is registered here in the regret for our great public achievements, and the relief that our malignity might end; its pastoral blind spot is evident in the assumption that only humans generate toxic chemical complexity. The extraordinary achievement of The World Without Us, then, is that for the first time it takes the measure of disanthropy, without rancor or evasion. The simple genius of Weisman's conceit, and its perfectly telegenic character, made it an irresistible topic for cable TV channels: National Geographic produced Aftermath: Population Zero in 2008, with the History Channel's Life After People released in 2008.11 While it would be unreason able to expect 90-minute documentaries to match the richness of detail of Weisman's book, the choices each documentary made—inclusions, absences and representational forms—provide an instructive contrast in which the ambivalence of The World Without Us is transformed into an actively harmful and delusive confidence in the impermanence of human impacts. The fate of the Eiffel Tower, especially, preoccupies the documentary makers, although Weisman does not mention it; presumably its universal recognition as a symbol of a country that seems ancient combines with the possibilities for destroying it with special effects in true disaster movie style, making it an ideal motif for human engineering succumbing to time and oxidation. After a brief glance at the misery awaiting dogs trapped in their homes, Life After People in particular remains preoccupied with technological structures such as bridges, dams and skyscrapers, combining CGI-simulated time-lapse and Crime Scene Investigation-style forensic zooms that show us their points of maximum vulnerability: vines snake upwards, buildings sigh and tumble down, and cars seethe with rust as they collapse into oblivion. The elliptical temporality of what it calls "nature's onslaught" upon our once-vaunted relics is reinforced by the logarithmic scale of the program as a whole, that accelerates from minutes "after people" through hours and days into centuries and millennia. Apart from falling buildings, though, the disanthropic fantasy is uncompromised by lasting residues, a point reinforced by the heavily ironic depiction of the Chernobyl site as a wilderness idyll where human absence has outweighed radioactive contamination. Weisman, too, amazed at the SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. 1, 2012</page><page sequence="14">Worlds without Us 53 swallows swooping over the "carcass of the hot reactor," writes: "You want them to fly away, fast and far. At the same time, it's mesmerizing that they're here. It seems so normal, as if apocalypse has turned out to be not so bad after all. The worst happens, and life goes on" (214). Crucially, though, he notes—as Life After People does not—the evidence of mutations in birds and mammals: ominous indications of long-term, imperceptible impacts that do not, perhaps, lend themselves to CGI animation. While the rewilding of the world is represented at times as vengeful, above all Life After People represents it as redemptive. The finale replays the accelerated demise of our cities and monuments, leaving only Mount Rushmore "to be gazed at in awe," says Science Fiction writer David Brin, "by the earliest of our replacements." The decay of our records on paper and cellulose, furred with fungus and bubbling in damp archives, will mean that, American presidents aside, "no-one will ever know what the human race looked like" and all our knowledge will be lost—although we know what Neanderthals looked like without photos, and of course almost all the human knowledge of ages past has been lost already. Nev ertheless, the vision of the island of Manahata returned to the swampy, forested state in which the Dutch colonists found it, seems less tragic than a final vindication, a visualization of Birkin's disanthropic fantasy. What remains stubbornly irredeemable is simply left out: namely, the permanent biogeographical alteration of the world. As Alfred Crosby pointed out in his seminal Ecological Imperialism, colonial travel has had an effect on species distributions comparable to tectonic shifts, reclosing the "Pangaean seams" that opened up between the continents millennia ago. Observing the riotous deracinated variety of the New York Botanical Garden, Weisman concedes that "The ecosystem here will be a human artifact that will persist in our absence, a cosmopolitan botanical mixture that would never have occurred without us" (32). In this context, the re deeming power of nature, that heals and soothes every human wound, seems a dangerously Utopian construct. Intriguingly, Aftermath seems slightly more ecological even as it is a lot more apocalyptic. While it shares the logarithmic timescale and love of simulated time-lapses of Life After People, its gravelly narration, plethora of toxic explosions and almost comical emphasis on the struggle for sur vival aligns it still more closely with disaster movies, morally as well as aesthetically. Drawing attention to the power and reach of human trans formations, Aftermath betrays somewhat more interest in their ecological ramifications: nuclear power plants and storage facilities burn fiercely in the absence of cooling water; climate change continues to affect global temperatures for a century or more after humans disappear; and we are informed with relish that the animals left behind are forced to "adapt or SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. 1, 2012</page><page sequence="15">54 Greg Garrard die." Indeed, in one unintentionally comic scene, a toy poodle is chased down and killed by feral German Shepherds, showing that it really is, now, a "dog eat dog" world. The Utopian pastoral of Life After People is replaced in Aftermath by sadistic glee and clunking irony: aircraft and power plants are destined for spectacular destruction, yet their automated systems enable them to go on absurdly functioning, emblems of machinic narcissism; modern works of architecture, both great and mean, are undermined by the pol lution emitted in building them, which weakens their steel skeletons and leaches salts out of their concrete. Again, nothing lasts, neither the Hoover dam—collapsed in only a few hundred years in this account—nor a plastic cellphone. Only the scattered residues of the Apollo missions, abandoned on the surface of the moon, will remain for eons, the Stars and Stripes stiffly staking its claim to eternity while North America is once again scoured flat by glaciers. That both documentaries propose Ameri can national symbols for perpetuity indicates how much they owe to the unreflective ethnocentrism of Hollywood disaster movies. In fact, as Weisman's experts aver, there is no evidence at present that the cellphone's polymers will degrade—ever. They may be broken into smaller and smaller pieces, but the longest and most stable molecular chains could be around indefinitely. What is more significant than this difference of opinion, however, is the evidence it provides that complex disanthropy is difficult to sustain against the gravitational pull of more familiar genres, be it the simple redemptive pastoral promised by Life After People or the cleansing apocalypse of Aftermath. Crucially, too, the TV documentaries picture the disanthropic conceit as a painless and instantaneous rapture—leaving cars and buses to collide, airplanes to crash unpiloted, coffee cups to drop from vanished hands—whereas for Weisman it is only a provisional move, the equivalent of the philosopher's thought experiment. In his final chapter he confronts, as I do here, the ultimate, much more challenging, implication of disanthropy: a world without children. The P Word: "Cuteness Saves the World" - or No Future? I'm hopeful that there's a real change taking place in moral attitudes: that it's not to do with saving pennies here and there, but it's morally wrong to waste energy because we are putting at risk our grandchildren. (David Attenborough, in BBC News, http:/ /news.bbc.co.uk/l/hi/uk politics/6176847. stm) SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. 1, 2012</page><page sequence="16">Worlds without Us 55 When there's no future how can there be sin We're the flowers in the dustbin We're the poison in your human machine We're the future your future ... No future for you no future for me No future no future for you (The Sex Pistols) In ecocriticism, just as in mainstream environmentalism, population is virtually unspeakable. A pall of historical guilt hangs over it—from sterilization programs, the coercive Chinese One Child policy, and even eugenics—as well as guilt by association with the racial, class and gender biases of the Reverend Malthus himself. So Catriona Sandilands claims that "a wide range of institutional environmental discourses represent and produce bodily practices of sexual regulation under the guise of a concern with the ecological impact of human population," a burden of oppres sive biopolitics that is "borne most heavily by women in countries of the South" (my italics, 20). Similarly, Morton states that "Malthus himself wrote his book on population to justify the British government slashing the welfare laws of his day" and condemns "the disturbing racism of the 'population debate'" (37). In both arguments, anxiety about population is a cover for other, more sinister political objectives. The standard "left ecolo gist" objection is the same as William Godwin's response to Malthus: the problem is inequality (and, we might now add, the consumption patterns of the wealthy), not sheer numbers. But of course greed and the unequal distribution of resources would matter a lot less in terms of environmental impact if there were fewer people. Patrick Curry's excellent analysis of the vicissitudes of "the P-word" observes that "it does not require genius to realize that if human population continues to grow at a sufficient rate for long enough, then no amount of technological tweaking ... or reduction of consumption ... will suffice to control and then reduce our ecological impact" (124). In Why We Disagree about Climate Change, Mike Hulme notes that "there is very little discussion about a desirable global population or about fertility rates" (270) in all the voluminous literature concerning carbon emissions targets, but goes on to say that "the lifestyle decision that has the single biggest impact on a person's carbon footprint—especially a person in the developed world—is how many children to have" (275). And yet, in the epigraph to this section, David Attenborough, Patron of the Optimum Population Trust, alludes to the risk to "our grandchildren" of insufficient environmental conscience, when their interests might best be served by not being born in the first place, so to speak. Despite its importance, ecocritics have had nothing to say about the population problem beyond dark allusions to the perils of Malthusianism. The sole challenge to modern reproductive assumptions comes instead SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. I, 2012</page><page sequence="17">56 Greg Garrard from queer theorist Lee Edelman, whose No Future attacks the appeal to "reproductive futurity" in the figure of the Child: That Child remains the perpetual horizon of every acknowledged poli tics, the fantasmic beneficiary of every political intervention. ... What ... would it signify not to be "fighting for the children"? How could one take the other "side," when taking any side at all necessarily constrains one to take the side of, by virtue of taking a side within, a political order that returns to the Child as the image of the future it intends? (3) Much of Edelman's discussion is caught in the archaic, involuted and un profitable travails of Lacanian analysis, and in fact he never mentions the role of the Child in environmental futurity, but his argument is strikingly pertinent. For instance, he sheds light on the way that the assurance of reproductive futurity is implicit in the very subject position that pretends to represent its disanthropic absence: To be there always, though unperceived, to inhabit the space of percep tion as such and thus to become the witness to one's absence, one's disembodiment: such fantasy presumes a reality guaranteed, not threatened, by time, sustained by the certainty that a "course of events" is bound to continue its course in due course after we are gone. (34) We have already noted the inherently contradictory, even disingenuous, character of disanthropy, but Edelman's argument implies that its fantasy of "disembodiment" is actually sustained by the infrastructure of repro ductive futurity. We can only enjoy seeing worlds without us because we—the heterosexual "we"—are so assured of our legacy. To the queer, the future will be "without us" regardless. For Edelman, "no future" means accepting—even celebrating—the homophobic association of the queer with the non-reproductive, the un natural and the death drive,12 but perhaps we should instead seek the ecocritic's response to his questions: "Who would, after all, come out for abortion or stand against reproduction, against futurity, and so against life?" (16) And again: Cathy, Eppie, Tiny Tim, the constantly multiplying children of Eve with the hopes that get put in their outstretched hands and the dreams that get read in their always wide eyes: dare we see ... this endless line of children—a genetic line, a narrative line stretched out to the crack of doom—as itself the nightmare of history from which we're helpless to awake? (149) Perhaps the most valuable contribution ecocriticism could make would be to search for paedophobic literature? Perhaps we need not to be taught to love nature more, but to love children less? We can clarify what is at stake in this argument by examining the opposite extreme: the superb Disney / Pixar animation Wall'E, which is so deeply invested in reproductive futurity that it features the first male SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. 1, 2012</page><page sequence="18">Worlds without Us 57 womb in a children's feature film. Dwarfed by skyscrapers of garbage, the clean-up robot Wall'E scurries about a blasted disanthropic landscape, vainly trying to bring to order the vast, lifeless detritus of a departed human civilization. He keeps operational with recycled bits of other, defeated Wall*Es, plays camp theatrical music to himself (a machine playing to a machine) and seeks the secret of love in an old video of Hello Dolly! Twenty-two minutes of the film pass before a single recognizable human word is spoken. All that remains seems proverbially indestruc tible: a discarded plastic Rubik's cube, his cockroach "sidekick" and the Twinkie Wall*E feeds to him. Wall'E is at once intensely heteronormative and gently challenging to gender norms. The smooth, gleaming, powerful "feminine" robot EVE (the ironically named Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluation probe) has to be "humanized"13 by the bumbling, "masculine" Wall'E, but their even tual romance proves capable of rekindling heterosexual feelings even in obese intergalactic consumers, once humans finally re-enter the picture. The redemptive plot is a tale of two wombs: EVE's, which embraces and protects a fragile seedling in accordance with her iron "directive" (her electro-biological clock is always ticking), and Wall• E's, designed to crush garbage but pressed into the same crypto-uterine service precisely insofar as his code is malfunctioning. While Morton is right that, in Wall*E, "cuteness saves the planet" (86), cuteness is invested in a camp, straight robot, self-made from cannibalized parts but broken enough to work properly—which is to say ethically, as Edelman shows, in the name of the seedling, the métonymie Child of coercive reproductive futurity. For a mainstream family animation feature, WalbE is startlingly critical of the "Buy and Large" megacorporation that, in collusion with over-fed, under-active consumers, has left the Earth a fevered, desiccated garbage dump; it endearingly takes the part of the "crazy," malfunctioning robots that come to the rescue of EVE and Wall'E; and its version of a world without us is, until the last few seconds of the film, unremittingly bleak. What it does not—cannot—do is invite reflection on the dark relationship between the condition of that world and the cuteness and heterosexual romance that, for the parents in the audience at least, ultimately gave purpose to the trip to the cinema in the first place. Luckily there is no need to draw the contrast in such stark terms: cuteness saves—and dooms—the planet, or No Future. There is really no fundamental tension between Attenborough's plea on behalf of our (notional) grandchildren and his patronage of the Optimum Population Trust. As the Dalai Lama points out: "There are six billion precious lives on Earth. All of them are under direct threat from other precious lives that are being added by the million" (Curry 2006:123). Though its message is SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. 1, 2012</page><page sequence="19">58 Greg Garrard engagingly simple, it is unnecessary even to join the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT), to which Weisman gives a sympathetic hearing near the end of The World Without Us: Under the motto "May we live long and die out/' [the] movement advocates that humanity avoid the agonizing, massive die-off that will occur when ... it becomes brutally clear that it was naïve to think we could all have our planet and eat it, too. Rather than face horrific resource wars and starvation that decimate us and nearly everything else as well, VHEMT proposes gently laying the human race to rest. (242) VHEMT's is a most genial and compassionate vision of a world with out people, but its representational forms are limited so far to cartoons on a website. It seems, indeed, that the bifurcation between Woolf and Lawrence indicated an inverse relationship between formal and moral disanthropy in all these artifacts: Edelman's febrile Lacanian argument; Snow's La Région Centrale; Herzog's alien perspectives; the worlds depicted without us in glorious CGI; and even Microcosmos arguably surrender ethical complexity in return for their theoretical or technical achievements. For all the formal challenges of these disanthropic visions, the moral challenge is at once simpler and far more difficult: to imagine voluntarily limiting ourselves to, at most, one child. Nothing makes more difference to our environmental impact, as Clive Hamilton shows: The carbon legacy of the average female in the United States is 18,500 tonnes of C02 while that of a Bangladeshi woman is only 136 tonnes. In other words, the future stream of carbon emissions following a decision by an American couple to have an extra child is 130 times greater that that of a decision by a Bangladeshi couple. (43). Yet largely uncritical celebration of procreation and reproductive futurity in mainstream culture is met, in the most misanthropic environ mentalisms, with malign images of humans as undifferentiated masses or diseases—other people's children, inevitably As Weisman shows, a vol untary global One Child Policy would mean a population of less than 6 billion by 2050, instead of the projected 9 billion, then 10.6 billion by the end of the century. At such far-more-manageable numbers ... we would have the benefit of all our progress plus the wisdom to keep our presence under control. That wisdom would come partly from losses and extinctions too late to reverse, but also from the growing joy of watching the world daily become more wonderful. The evidence wouldn't hide in statistics. It would be outside every human's window, where refreshed air would fill each season with more birdsong. (272-3) One might even see a hare sitting up. It is, no less than every other vision of a sustainable future, somewhat Utopian, but unlike most Utopias it is given to every fertile reader to bring SubStance #127, Vol. 41, no. 1, 2012</page><page sequence="20">Worlds without Us 59 it closer to reality. Ecocritics can make that contribution themselves, of course, but they can also assist by not deploying the bogeyman of Thomas Malthus to stymie thought and action. It is not the world without us that calls for new artistic forms, but the world with far fewer of us that we should seek to imagine, and to achieve. Bath Spa University Notes 1. I am asserting as much in this essay, but should readers know of other—or earlier—ex amples of disanthropy I'd be pleased to hear about them. 2. For an analysis of the Nietzsche / Lawrence dialogue in ecocritical terms, see Garrard 2006. 3. An alternative term would be "ananthropy," but that would mark merely the absence of people, not our having been, in the narrative or cinematic "vision," deliberately elimi nated. Moreover, "disanthropy" maintains a justly perilous proximity to "misanthropy." 4. I am indebted to my colleague Paul Edwards for clarification on this point. 5. The term "deep time" itself was introduced in John McPhee's Basin and Range (1981). 6. For an overview of these developments, see Garrard 2010. 7. The only exception I can think of is Jim Crace's partly disanthropic novel Being Dead (2000). 8. It may, of course, be a typo. 9. In this respect it seems to be the opposite of many cultural categories, that start with broad definitions and end up distended beyond any conceivable usefulness, e.g. "post modernism," "the abject," etc. "Disanthropy" starts small and may end up winnowed away to nothing. I had initially planned a typology of disanthropy, but there is no point in a typology where every type has at most one token. 10. The comment is made in the documentary included on the DVD "The Making of Mi crocosmos." 11. Very late in the research process I found out about an earlier disanthropic text, Dougal Dixon's After Man: A Zoology of the Future (1981), and an Animal Planet series, The Future is Wild (2003). 12. As an argument within queer theory, Edelman is depressingly responsive to the polariza tion of American sexual politics, in which overt homophobia is considered acceptable, as well as recalling the adolescent rebelliousness of punk. In a European context, the liberal compromise, which simply rejects the equation of the queer with Freud's mythical "death drive," would hopefully seem more appealing. 13. Both are, of course, thoroughly anthropomorphic from the outset. Works Cited Anderson, Michael J. "Michael Snow and the 1970s Aesthetic of Excess: La Région Centrale.
