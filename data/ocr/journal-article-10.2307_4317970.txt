By Melville Jacobs. (Seattle: University of Wash- ington Press, 1960). Pp. xii, 359. $4.50. THE TEXTS underlying this study were recorded by the author in 1929-30 from Mrs. Victoria Howard, one of the last speakers of Clackamas, a dialect of Columbia River Chinook. The material Professor Jacobs obtained from this remarkable narrator was pub- lished in two parts, Clackamas Chinook Texts, I-II (1958-59). These volumes contain sixty-four mythological tales and additional folk- 93</page><page sequence="2">94 Midwest Folklore Xll:2 loristic material, all in Clackamas texts with English translations. In 1959, Jacobs' first study of the collection appeared, The Content and Style of an Oral Literature, containing detailed analyses of eight selected texts and a systematic study of the entire material. The present volume completed the sequence with analyses of the remain- ing fifty-six tales. Application of principles previously defined and the absence of contextual material, notes, and indices in the recent volume necessitate simultaneous reading of all three publications. Presumably no other collection of mythological tales has been so meticulously scrutinized as those of Victoria Howard in Professor Jacobs' reports. Since these narratives constitute all that is known of Clackamas tradition, the analyzer had no other records to rely on than these same tales with the meager support of sparse ethno- graphical data from other Chinook communities. Jacobs has brought his method to bear on this situation. The mode of discourse he has chosen is a discrete analysis of each individual text by rendering a free version of the tale interwoven with a running interpretative commentary. It is difficult to summarize his interpretations under separate headings. The questions Jacobs propounds are of the kind likely to be phrased by Freudian-oriented critics of literature rather than by folklorists. He looks upon his tales as the products of an oral literary art reminiscent of the drama. But above all, his exposi- tion aims at the comprehension of the social function of the myth, apart from its literary and artistic service. In one and the same analytic operation, the author attempts to show how the tales are explainable as stylized expressions of the needs and feelings in the society which created them, and how they provide an outlet for the suppressed compulsions of their transmitors. The penetration to a deeper level of psychological processes, accountable for otherwise ill- comprehended features, reveals principal themes which are lost or disregarded by students who limit their attention to the structure and the dissemination of tales. Professor Jacobs' perennial acquaint- ance with Northwest Indian informants enables him to use his own discretion. Drawing from his wide knowledge of the area in general, he can afford to generalize and to sketch with certitude when turning to Clackamas mythology in particular. WVith insight and ingenuity, he discloses what their tales must have meant to the Clackamas in- cluiding, then, what a Clackamas audience most likely deduced from a myth recital of thoughts not explicitly expressed. Tale types which have a cross-cultural distribution-as a good number of Jacobs' Clackamas tales have-obviously vary from one culture area to another with a constancy determinable from socio-</page><page sequence="3">Sven Liljeblad 95 cultural and ethno-psychological causative particularities distinctive for each area. This is the point of departure in Jacobs' discussion. Thus, for instance, the social status of women, lower among the Clackamas than among the Sahaptins, is taken to explain the occur- rence of the Orpheus myth in the tradition of the latter and the substitution of a similar tale with a female hero in the tradition of the Clackamas, to whom a husband's journey to his deceased wife rather than the opposite must have seemed queer (p. 279). But only intermittently does the author permit himself to pursue this line of reasoning. Preoccupied with his intensive study of a local tradition surviving only in the tales of one single but unusually proficient and helpful informant, Jacobs rarely finds the place for comparative views. The one variant of a tale he happens to have on hand is his full frame of reference. Public familiarity with a tale in its local standard form ensured its identity from recital to recital (p. viii). One fully told version would, therefore, be representative of all versions. Substituting what seems intuitively obvious for what would have been directly observable, if sufficiently detailed ethno- graphic data had been available, the author proceeds to study his tales in a sociocultural setting much of which is deduced by infer- ence from the tales themselves. The mythological tale in Professor Jacobs' interpretation is not merely fiction picturing the origin of existence, but a sanction of social institutions, of moral codes and ethical values, and of religious beliefs; a drama of rights and wrongs and of man's anxieties and ten- sions. Now and then, it is the stylized stories of tragic situations and human mistakes. As would be expected in a Northwest-Indian com- munity, commercialism and class distinction are befitting themes, "for Clackamas mythology expressed feelings of the rich, for the most part" (p. 215). Since these tales were told in a men's society which would tolerate a man's humiliation of a woman but not the opposite, they often express a woman's rebellious attitude toward women's established role, suppressed female resentment of polygyny, and feelings of co-wives toward one another (e.g., pp. 117, 172, 216, 227). Many of Jacobs' expositions are frankly neo-Freudian. The culture hero represents "the cultural heritage which is anthropomor- phized in a paternal figure" (p. 63). In plots where the villain is the hero's father or the heroine's mother, Jacobs finds an obvious Oedipal relationship (e.g., pp. 56, 142-143, 283). There is the in- teresting observation that covert Oedipal plots are exhibited in grand- parent-grandchild relationships as a consequence of extended parental function two generations distant (pp. 52-53, and passim). Actions</page><page sequence="4">96 Midwest Folklore XII:2 contrary to the customs of the Clackamas, which in the mythological tales invariably result in disaster, rather than being dismissed as in- explainable in their social context, are interpreted as warnings proving the wrongness and absurdity of deviation from customary behavior. But also in sanction of this order, the author finds a psychological process (e.g., p. 136). Sometimes Jacobs' suppositions seem surprisingly rationalistic, even on the verge of being startling. He equates the Myth Age with a "precultural era," a somewhat puzzling term, since he actually recognizes cultural determinants and makes good use of them for cultural reconstruction. In the dual nature of the "precultural peo- ple" (that is, the characters in the mythological tales) being both men and beasts he sees the relationship between the Myth-Age heroes and their guardian spirits or, as he prefers to call them, their "spirit powers"-in fact, a much better term. In conformity with this idea-since spirit powers may be at odds-the author splits if need be a mythological title into a multiplicity and speaks about "a Coyote personality" or "one of the Coyotes" rather than of Coyote as a mythological character (e.g., pp. 50, 75). The net result is an im- posing array of Clackamas mythological figures numbering "well over three hundred adults and children" among whom we find "Coyote men, Grizzly men and women, a man called Blue Jay, Bear women, Skunk men, Coon men, and Panther men" (p. x). The behavioral peculiarities of these mythological associates, the author finds, are so consistent with the human side of their character that he shuts his eyes to their theriomorphic distinctiveness (for a general discussion of this subject, see Content and Style, pp. 6-7, 136-177). Thus, the implication in the statement that "Coon stands for a sadis- tic, clever, and sometimes kindly man" is not the same as if saying that Coon (as a mythological character) is sadistic, clever, and some- times kindly. Jacobs supports his refusal to recognize any but purely anthropomorphous beings in his tales with affirmations solicited from his informants (Content and Style, p. 6). These are statements which demand attention but also reconsideration. Heuristic infringing notwithstanding, mythological thought em- bodies itself in alternant theriomorphic and anthropomorphic images. There is the danger that the author by denying theriomorphic char- acteristics might strip the tale of the duplexity in meaning without which the myth would not be a myth. Moreover, his assertion is at variance with his texts. It would be difficult to conceive what actu- ally happens in these tales-above all, then, in the tales with aetiol- ogical motifs-without granting validity to the scores of theriomorphic</page><page sequence="5">Sven Liljeblad 97 attributes bestowed upon the characters. Blue Jay-not to mention the rest-occurs in the Clackamas tales with both crest and wings. He may be the clown and gullible fellow he is in these tales, less because the Clackamas needed relief from latent anxieties and sup- pressed antipathy to the upper-class boaster he is supposed to repre- sent than because certain types of tales require a trickster with exactly these eccentricities in order to fill the plot. Blue Jay's candidacy for mythological heroship in this capacity is apparent, since not only to Northwest-Coast Indians but to people in general this bird seems to display just such characteristics. The further one reads in Professor Jacobs' book, where one de- tailed tale analysis follows upon another but subject matters as such are ephemeral, impressions multiply that the obvious is brushed aside in order to pave the way for a reasoning that presumably would have been beyond the abstraction power of his informant. For exam- ple, even if "Grizzly people" are "displacements for people's hostile feelings about elders," the epical necessity that the tale calls for such characters in the role of adversaries should not be ignored. One may say: the characteristic properties of a mythological figure are by choice realized in action according to the fixed plots in particular tales. Professor Jacobs would prefer to say: the personalities of actors under a common title vary according to the different kinds of people they represent and the social situation each tale is about. His suggestions are constructive inasmuch as they tie the tale to social reality. Discussion of style and of humorous expressions is kept to a minimum in the present volume. It would be difficult to comprise all comic features in these tales without the guidance of Jacobs' highly informative exposition of Clackamas humor in The Content and Style of an Oral Literature. In this chapter, the author analyzed 130 humorous situations in Clackamas mythology and classified the 914 fun-provoking elements which he found, single or in clusters, embodied in the narrative according to sixteen classes of major types of stimuli ranging from sociocultural factors to stylistic devices. Jacobs' classification of humorous components in the Clackamas tales has general applicability. Occurrences of purely linguistic types of humor- ous expressions listed by the author but not included in his own inven- tory await analysis of the langTuage, which remains a desideratum. The structure of each tale is outlined with reference to dra- maturgy as a standard of value, the ensuing terminology being ex- plained in Content and Style of an Oral Literature (pp. 211-219). The concept of structural similarities between certain classes of the</page><page sequence="6">98 Midwest Folklore XII:2 folktale and the drama is not entirely new. It has occasionally been brought up for discussion in folklore seminars and has as often been rejected. There actually is need of a fixed terminology for tale struc- ture. Since the choice of terms is arbitrary, any set would do if consistently employed. Jacobs proposes such terms as "act," "scene," and "entr'act" for plot analysis. However, his own application of these terms lacks obligatory congruity to sequences of traits as units of action in the composition of tales, a trait (whether this be a motif or the incidental detail of a motif) sometimes being identical with a "scene" but sometimes split into several "scenes." What Jacobs apparently has in mind is the scenic range of particular occurrences rather than plot structure. Otherwise, consistency in application of theatrical terminology leaves nothing to be desired. Tales are called "plays" or "dramas" by turns; a tale recital is "the public performance of the 'play'," a passive character in a tale is "an actor who never walks across the stage," and the totality of mythological characters are "Thespians of the Myth Era." The use of this terminology seems unwarranted and artificial. Applicability may even be ques- tioned. The artistic monodramatic attitude ("acting") of some (but far from all) narrators should not be overlooked, nor should such formulaic features in the circumstantial language of the mythological tale which the author terms "curtain-raising devices." But all this is a matter of performance and narrative style irrelevant to the structure of the tale. Professor Jacobs defines his need of "captions borrowed from Western theater" as that of describing "the range of dramatic forms, from small to large and from comedy to tragedy" (Content and Style, p. 211). It is doubtful that a native informant with full command of narrative techniques could ever be found to whom a mythological tale would be tragic; adverse and scandalous, yes, and even pitiful, but not tragic, a conception entirely foreign to him. A concession to this is made by Jacobs himself when he says that "an attempt to arrange Clackamas responses on a continuum from laughter to responses of a dolorous nature would probably fail" (Content and Style, p. 178). Jacobs' painstaking analytic review of his Clackamas collection is flexible and allows for multiple and alternative suggestions. His procedure is consistent but lacks rigorous control and invites ambi- guity. Despite the absence of verbalized emotions, in most of the tales Jacobs finds "major feeling constellations in social relationship." These interpretations are taken as evidences that such were the feelings that generated the stories. Vice versa, the presence of these feelings in the tales is taken to denote that they were harbored in the Clack-</page><page sequence="7">Sven Liljeblad 99 amas society. In other words, information can be gleaned from the stories about sentiments in social relationship postulated in order to explain the stories; the stories, once explained, document the assumed sentiments. Since these stories are essentially all that is left of Clack- amas tradition, the circle can be avoided only by comparing the tales with observable data in other traditions. Narrative features can, of course, be compared with whatever there is of ethnographical infor- mation from neighbor communities, and this Jacobs must have done throughout, although references are not given. For instance, first with the information that drumsticks used by players of the hand game were made from hazel sticks, the metamorphosis of a hazel into a person who continuously plays the hand game becomes in- telligible (p. 174). The concept of spirit powers with which these tales are saturated is thoroughly explained in its relation to actual life situations. Social relationship as pictured in the tales is compared with the complexity of Chinook social life. But even though characteristic features of Clackamas mythology may reflect characteristics of the Clackamas society, it does not thereby follow that the structure of every single tale and its essential com- ponents can be deduced from local conditions. Certain tale types and motifs must be screened out either because of antiquity--possibly existing before the Clackamas society existed-or eventually as being derived from foreign traditions, which could mean the same thing. In his present work, Jacobs is not concerned with distributional studies, strictly speaking not even with typological ones, which could hardly dispense with the former. This is both a strength and a weak- ness: a strength, because the author can limit his efforts to one culture area which he masters; a weakness, because some of the tales he discusses cannot have been generated from the sociocultural variables he refers to in his interpretation of local variants. Some of his tales, presumably most of them, are not local constructs although garbed in a local dress. The origin of a tale cannot be dated, nor can the cultural conditions of its origin be ascertained. Before the tale reached the Clackamas, it already had a history, but this history is not known. Thus, one and the same tale might have struck upon particular feelings in the Clackamas and upon entirely different feelings elsewhere; but the tale, keeping its identity, cannot be ex- plained from either. It would, therefore, seem extremely hazardous to analyze a tale merely as a product of local opinions, sentiments, and values. For instance, the author treats his text number 3, "Coon and Coyote Went and Stole" (pp. 8-16), as a recent composition. As he points out, the latter part of this two-episodic tale is the wide-</page><page sequence="8">100 Midwest Folklore XII:2 spread type, Fish hoarded in compounded water released by the culture hero. Despite its distribution beyond the limits of Northwest Indian culture, Jacobs finds it suggestive of Clackamas belief (p. 16). The preceding episode describing Coon's theft of fish and how he deceives Coyote, the author contends, expresses sibling rivalry and "appears to be an addition which artists and community devised in a recent period." This supposition is an extremely unlikely one. The connection of the two motifs seems original in this type (cf. Boas, Tsimshian Mythology, p. 653 ff.). Moreover, The fish-stealing trickster and the dupe connects the tale with a well-known type of world-wide distribution (Aarne-Thompson Type 1) which is cer- tainly not recent. An even more striking example is Jacobs' Text 26, "Seal Took Them to the Ocean" (pp. 153-167), which also in other respects is a tale of note. Seal Hunter, induced by his well-to-do older brother, who contemplates his destruction, takes off with a crew of ten follow- ers to hunt a supernatural seal. The hunters spear the Seal Woman, who pulls their canoe seaward to her own abodes where they are received by a woman who acts as their hostess. With her assistance, they perform various risky contests imposed on them by Beetle, the female head of the hostile community. On their homeward journey, they pass safely through sky shutters that rise and fall. Blue Jay, the most active of the companions, has observed Sturgeon kill and bake his wife who is then revived. Back home, he tries the same trick on his own wife, but with fatal results. Jacobs interprets this tale as "a contest of spirit-power strength between two antagonistic brothers," although such rivalry is not explicitly phrased by the nar- rator; but his characterization of the story as a "potpourri of regionally widespread myth adventures" is contradicted by the fact that the story itself is widespread. It is not a potpourri but a unique story with a firm composition that has withstood innumerable retellings and substitutions of details: the story about a hero sent by an evil- minded relative on a perilous expedition aboard a craft manned by a crew of extraordinary traveling companions engaging in a series of dangerous contests aided by a patroness and with the addition of the Symplegades motif and the resuscitating or rejuvenating boiling test. The sequence recurs at full length in the Old-Greek story about the Argonauts and also (with reduction of the Symplegades motif) in some Balkan variants of the European folktale, "The Extra- ordinary Companions" (Type 513). A genetic relationship between the three tales (Jacobs' Clackamas tale, the tale underlying the Argonautica, and the modern European folktale) seems reasonably</page><page sequence="9">Sven Liljeblad 101 certain, although it is apparent that the Clackamas tale is no recent borrowing from Europeans since local variants exist and the motifs occur in other typological settings throughout the Pacific Northwest. It seems equally certain that the historical process at the bottom of this relationship can never be probed. In lieu of this assumption, one may find it more reasonable that cyclic formation of identical test motifs in separate traditions would result in very similar tale types. But for the present discussion this is entirely irrelevant. The point here is that the story, divested of local adornment, is so old that it remains unaffected by any social conditions, sentiments, and world views, be it Old-Greek or Northwest-Coast Indian thoughts. Another matter is that motifs typical of the test stories of the North Pacific Coast occur in the Clackamas story but not in its European parallels. When Seal Hunter and his company are im- prisoned in the sweathouse, they survive the hot steam thanks to the cooling water seeping in through the hole dug by the two Beavers and the two Martens. In the European tale, the hot place where the hero and his followers are confined is cooled by water which The Big-Drinker keeps in his stomach. Jacobs deplores the absence of ethnographic material suggesting "deeper psychological responses to sweathouses with their nearly suffocating and burning vapors" (p. 160). Why should there necessarily be psychological responses to such things in the tales? With due respect for deep psychology, it would seem advisable to begin the analysis of a tale by defining what in that particular tale is autochthonous and what is not. Otherwise, ethnographic clues might threaten to go beyond the prob- able, as when in the tale just mentioned the occurrence of the world- widely known contest motif of climbing a slippery pole reaching to the sky is motivated by the assumption that "very likely some Indians of the region had such a sport" (p. 159). Component motifs of a tale which have followed this tale throughout its wide distribution can have no other motivation than the one the tale implies, in this case the retention of a good old supernatural test. In the main, it is on the comparative level that Jacobs' argument is halting. When he leaves the firm ground of Clackamas tradition, where he can never be taken to task, and ventures upon generaliza- tions, it is difficult to follow. His discussion of contests determining fatherhood results in a lengthy discourse on contrasts between Clacka- mas and Euro-American romanticism (pp. 127-132). Everybody would agree were it not for the author's confidence that Clackamas views in this respect are "different from anything in European folk- lore," and that the European tale-contrary to the Clackamas tale</page><page sequence="10">102 Midwest Folklore XII:2 would have stressed "a Romeo-Juliet kind of relationship between romantic lovers." How can the author possibly document this asser- tion? After all, a sixteenth-century Italian novel was not folklore- nor were Tristan and Isolde or Fleure and Blanchefleure-but the European folktale is. Nowhere in European folktales is there any hint of romantic love. To the utterly staid society in which those tales were told, affections of that sort would have been at least as strange and incomprehensible as they were to the Clackamas. Ironic as it may seem, one of the most perdurable of European folktales (Type 675) faithfully reflects all the characteristics Professor Jacobs confers on his Clackamas tale (Text 23). In this European tale, the student will find both the father test-for the sake of clarity why not call it, as it should be called, Motif H481-which brought about the discussion, and the rest of the themes completing the grand total of the Clackamas equivalent, but no romantic love. Admittedly, it would be premature to claim identity between two geographically disconnected types before either one has been fully investigated; but it is doubly dangerous to pass categorical judgment either for contrast or for similarity between two disconnected traditions, in case these traditions contain a number of closely related types which have not yet been compared. But one need not seek comparative examples far removed from Clackamas tradition in order to illustrate what would seem to be rash conclusions drawn from the analysis of a tale studied in isola- tion. Professor Jacobs explains a suirprisingly large number of his tales as being indicative of fear and horror, each one in its own way. Be it reluctantly admitted that "Black Bear Woman and Grizzly Woman and Their Sons" (pp. 102-111), as Jacobs assumes, was con- ceived by the Clackamas as "a terror drama which has unity of mood and focus upon a central personality." Elsewhere, this tale (also with extension of the Grizzly story beyond the ordinary plot of the tale) is not so apprehended. A comparative study of this type would doubtless reveal that the plot does not center upon "a central per- sonality" (that, namely, of the ogre-like Grizzly); it centers on the revenge and successful escape of the bear (or deer) children, who are the heroes of the tale wherever it has been recorded. Shoshoni children to this day have loved this tale as their favorite bed-time story, which would not speak for its character of creating "an atmos- phere of psychotic-generated terror." Professor Jacobs' unique approach to the analysis of his con- textual material must be appreciated as an attempt to apply literary criticism to the study of the folktale. But it must be seriously ques-</page><page sequence="11">Sven Liljeblad 103 tioned if this is possible. He explicitly accepts popular narratives as literature. The day he recorded one of these tales, it became a piece of literature, but before this event it had nothing to do with litera- ture. Products of oral tradition, including the mythological tale, are bound in the strait jacket of distinctive regularities that are inap- plicable to individual fiction and preclude free expression of thoughts and sentiments which, consequently, cannot be elicited from the narrative. A collection of tales recorded long ago is a closed body of material from which the student can draw no such information without begging the question. The divisibility of the folktale into easily recognized traditional elements makes it susceptible to a taxonomy which has been worked on and constantly improved through three-quarters of a century. Without due regard to the universality of these regularities, it would seem a hopeless task for the ethnologist, however familiar he may be with the culture of the area under study, to solve ex hypothesi the equation of its fiction. Intuitive virtuosity alone will not do. Why should (in order to quote the author) one "oral literature" seem more "exotic" than another? Because, the author contends, "many of the themes are foreign" (Content and Style, p. 1). Foreign, appar- ently-unless viewed from a plainly ethnocentric angle-to any other oral tradition. But this is not entirely true. If scholarly concern with the building material of primitive fiction must be so segmented that it would be apprehended only in terms of "associations and feelings" of separate societies, folklore as a discipline would not exist. On the contrary, since no oral tradition originates and survives in isolation but constantly interchanges with others, any analysis of structure and content which totally avoids concomitant comparative exploration remains inconclusive. No one would wish to deny the desirability of submitting one's folkloristic field data to psychological and sociol- ogical inspection of the material suitable for such scrutiny, but the stability of traditional narrative forms often precludes any such inter- pretation. Progress is to be made not by ignoring this obstacle but rather by broadening one's own view to account for existing informa- tion.</page></plain_text>
